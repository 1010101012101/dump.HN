I had read a headline saying that 5c is 3 times as popular as 5s. So trying to be as just in my speculating as I could, I went for a best-case worst-case range.<p>But in this instance it reminds me that to err is human as well. Because while trying to find the headline I was thinking of, I realized I&#x27;d mixed up my C&#x27;s and my S&#x27;s. It&#x27;s the iPhone 5s that could be 3 times as popular as the 5c (<a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57604127-37/iphone-5s-activations-more-than-triple-those-of-5c-says-report/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57604127-37/iphone-5s-acti...</a>).<p>So here is my new speculation! iPhone 5c sells 2.25 million while iPhone 5s sells 6.75 million units. Indeed that&#x27;s a little better than last year&#x27;s 5 million, but my speculative  gut is still telling me the 5c to 5s ratio is not quite that high.",1379951981

6431807,comment,6430733,6431192,1,0,Filligree,,,"We&#x27;re quite sure it has more raw power, yes.<p>And a lot of its power comes from special-purpose circuits, yep; you&#x27;re only wrong in the order of magnitude. (Billions, not millions)<p>It also has a couple other &#x27;advantages&#x27;. For instance, running at 100Hz means far lower power consumption. Of course, it also means many problems can only be solved through precaching; notice how much better computers are than people at, say, bouncing a ball, while using ludicrously less cpu-time.<p>For the raw power calculation, though...<p>We don&#x27;t have a perfect model of neurons yet, but it appears likely that the average neuron can be modelled by a circuit of 500 or so transistors; contrariwise, a single neuron can easily model a single transistor. Neurons are more complex, no question about it; I believe their behaviour was once compared to vacuum tubes, although that&#x27;s incorrect. The synapse count is more typically used for comparisons; problem is, each neuron has multiple synapses, and they&#x27;re not quite independent.<p>To make the problem more complex, synapses double as memory devices; details of the chemistry of a single synapse can change fairly quickly, apparently allowing for long-term memory and skill formation without changing the gross structure of the brain (that is, graph connectivity). Though the connectivity also changes. The total storage capacity of the brain has been estimated at anything from a few gigabytes (very, <i>very</i> good compression algorithms; you might even call them AI-complete) to several terabytes, but it&#x27;s nothing to write home about.<p>Now, there are 6 billion transistors in the most recent CPUs, and 85 billion synapses in the human brain. Naively, this would make the human brain anywhere from 14 to 7000 times more powerful than a modern i7, but of course there are confounding factors.<p>For starters, the aforementioned frequency differences. The i7 can run serial algorithms; the brain essentially cannot. Any given thought you have may be produced over a fairly long period, but it could be no more than a second; in the latter case, this means only 100 cycles. So it&#x27;s pretty much got to be put together from previously-made components... meanwhile, the i7 can run several billion cycles of serial logic in that period. This doesn&#x27;t just mean doing single things faster; per Amdahl&#x27;s law there are some algorithms that cannot be usefully parallelized, so the i7 can run them while you cannot, and it may therefore be able to do the same thing <i>using less overall resources</i>.<p>Okay, so that makes the brain seem less impressive. It&#x27;s especially the case for motor functions - a great deal of the brain is dedicated to that, largely because there&#x27;s no time to do longwinded calculations, so it all has to be precached. Which is why you need a lot of practice to reliably throw a basketball. It&#x27;s an immense waste of space - a very cheap computer can do better, where we&#x27;ve invented the algorithms. Our robots are getting pretty good at moving, in some constrained circumstances.<p>On the flip side there are problems that appear to be inherently parallel, such as face-recognition; all our best approaches so far essentially amount to checking every part of the image against every conceivable possibility. Here the brain has a major advantage, because neurons are damned well suited for the purpose; one might call them well-tuned to running neural networks. Where we&#x27;re using general-purpose hardware to check several possibilities one after another the brain can have cheap neurons hanging out on the visual cortex, listening for particular signals, and never doing anything else.<p>Conclusion? Heh, can&#x27;t say I have one, except.. the brain uses special-purpose circuitry everywhere, but half the time it&#x27;s from a lack of choice. It can&#x27;t really do anything <i>else</i>. Regardless, technologically it&#x27;s still a generation ahead of us, packing more power into a smaller space and energy budget than we can hope to.. but not two, or three, and our own speedy general-purpose systems have their own advantages that will eventually let them outperform it.<p>EDIT: I should clarify, by &#x27;generation&#x27; I mean a human generation - thirty years, not three. At the current rate of progress, which is likely irrelevant; we&#x27;ve already got good enough computers for AI (finally), we just need to use a lot of them.",1379951732

I&#x27;ll answer the questions that would be more directly related to the story though.<p>For backups we use another Percona tool: <a href=""http://www.percona.com/software/percona-xtrabackup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.percona.com/software/percona-xtrabackup</a>
It&#x27;s free and works great.<p>Disaster recovery is standard stuff. Backups/hot backups to external and recover as necessary (generally we try to keep that to never).<p>Monitoring is outside of the scope of XtraDB, but take a look at MONYog.<p>Now clustering is more XtraDB related. The clustering is nearly dead simple. If you use the (technically deprecated) wsrep_urls configuration option you can spin up a cluster from scratch without needing to worry about master location. Not sure WHY they deprecated this, I guess some people had issues with it, but it has worked fine since the beginning for us.<p>You don&#x27;t need a master/slave relationship unless your writes are really sky-high, or same with reads. Basically make sure you have a good number of wsrep_slave_threads defined (double CPU cores seems to work well for starters).<p>Sharding, partitioning and archiving are kind of outside the direct scope of XtraDB. You&#x27;d be better served looking up documentation online for more info than I&#x27;d be able to provide in a short post here. Insofar as it ties in to XtraDB though, I think there&#x27;s nothing wrong with jumping straight from a single DB node to this solution. You just really have to have the additional CPU/memory resources to add more nodes (you need at least three to keep the cluster alive if one dies... two will get you split brain if one dies).

They could have easily taken that and built a device similar to the Chomecast/Apple TV for dirt cheap and had a decent head start.<p>Their plans for Xbox One are interesting with all of the TV features and HDMI pass through but the Xbox One is seriously expensive so it still only really appeals to pretty committed console gamers.<p>With Ballmer leaving in the next year I hope Microsoft bring in a decent tech-oriented CEO although I have a feeling they will go for another business guy who will do similar to what Ballmer did.

However, the old-age insurance programthe precursor to today&#x27;s Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance, or Social Security, programwas not designed specifically to deal with the economic crisis of that era. Indeed, monthly benefit payments, under the original Act, were not scheduled to begin until 1942. In addition, from the beginning, the Social Security program has embodied social insurance principles that were widely discussed even before the onset of the Great Depression.<p>>Although the Great Depression was a catalyst for the creation of the Social Security program, the idea of social insurance predated the committee&#x27;s work and the Depression. As early as the 1880s, Germany had built a social insurance program (one requiring contributions from workers) that provided for sickness, maternity, and old-age benefits.1 Some authors have linked Germany&#x27;s early adoption of social insurance programs to its rapid industrialization in the latter half of the 19th century (Schottland 1963, 15; Schieber and Shoven 1999, 17). A significant period of industrialization and urbanization also preceded the advent of social insurance programs in the United States. In 1880, the populations of farm and nonfarm workers were about equally balanced, but by 1930, workers in farm occupations accounted for only 21 percent of the workforce (Census Bureau 1956, 195).<p>>As the nation industrialized, increasing numbers of Americans depended on wage income (and less on family-based structures typical of a farm economy). Further, Schieber and Shoven (1999) argue that wage income, even before the Depression, was volatile. From 1905 to 1909, the nonfarm unemployment rate varied widely (ranging from 3.9 percent to 16.4 percent), with a similarly wide range (4.1 percent to 19.5 percent) occurring from 1920 to 1924 (Schieber and Shoven 1999, 19). Older workers, in particular, often bore the brunt of economic downturns.2 Cyclical swings in the economy were not the only concern. Lost wages due to disability, death, or retirement were also seen as problems not adequately dealt with by the structures of an industrial economy. Academic and political interest grew in social insurance plans that would smooth out the volatility of income or, said differently, insure against fluctuations in labor-market income.<p>Second of all, the life expectancy in 1935 was 61.7. Lots of people work until 61.7.",1379950465

What was the previous record?<p>While I have no doubt that this was overall a record-breaking weekend for Apple, they are likely hoping that this gets interpreted as iPhone 5S sells better than the iPhone 5 did at its opening weekend. I think this is highly unlikely, though, because the 9 million includes both iPhone 5s and iPhone 5C, whereas previous year&#x27;s record breaking sales number of 5 million included only the iPhone 5.<p>So how many iPhones 5S did Apple sell compared to iPhone 5 last year? Let&#x27;s say the 5S and the 5C sold equally well (which is VERY doubtful considering not just price but also availability). This would put both iPhone 5S and 5C at 4.5 million. Both below iPhone 5 sales of 5 million. It is much more likely, however, that the 5C sold many more units than the 5S thus putting the 5S as lower than 4 million units sold, perhaps as low as 2.25 million.<p>There is no bad news here for Apple as I&#x27;m sure their profit margins on the 5C are similar, if not higher than the 5S. But it does indicate the oncoming commodification of smartphones and other personal digital devices. The 5C is definitely holding its own, and Apple&#x27;s brand is as strong as ever but I just wonder if Apple really wants to get into this kind of competition.",1379950329

While I can see more and more of the market moving towards Open solutions, I can only see FSF-created solutions dragging us down.",1379948667

While I don&#x27;t think I can make any real recommendations because I don&#x27;t know your specific requirements, I highly suggest checking out Hetzner and OVH dedicated servers.  I found that the ping time from hetzner to customers in the US did not make a difference for my purposes, and I can get a much much beefier server at hetzner than linode.<p>To be fair, the negatives I have experienced so far are: hetzner&#x27;s management console is pretty poor compared to linode&#x27;s (but it gets the job done), and linode is a self-serve almost instant provisioning while hetzner seems to take about 12 hours.",1379948619

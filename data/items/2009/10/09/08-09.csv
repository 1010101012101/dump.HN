A lot of artists and athletes have insurance contracts that require them to only do work when they are working. This is why you'll rarely hear of a basketball player doing a pickup game. A sprained ankle or blown knee off the court and they can, really, lose everything. Most of them do enjoy the game so they'll play in disguise or an alias.<p>When millions of dollars are on the line, sometimes, your passion can become your prison.",1255078765

So I stopped the thread this way.<p>That said, seriously, I think that what applies for SSD applies for RAM: that it's going to be cheaper and cheaper, and bigger, super fast, and unlike SSDs the writing and reading latencies are comparable, so even if as today it's a psychological barrier to hold your data in RAM, I think it is going to be much more common in high load applications in the future.<p>Actually most people are doing it already, with memcached.

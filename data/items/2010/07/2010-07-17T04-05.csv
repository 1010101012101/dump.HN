1523314,comment,1522352,1522352,0,0,NateLawson,,,"Hi, we're the ones who were interviewed for this article. First, the article has been updated (including headline, which now reads ""Authentication crack...""). The author mistakenly focused on the fact that OAuth and OpenID are used for authentication, and thus substituted ""password"" for ""token"" in his head when we explained things. I'll have to work on speaking more clearly.  :-)<p>The attack is not new. But it's still <i>everywhere</i>. That's why we're giving a talk at Blackhat. We are hoping this will finally be the year people take timing attacks seriously and fix them.<p>The point of our talk is to give concrete numbers to let people make their own decisions about exploitability. One result is a matrix of language (C, Java, Ruby, Python, PHP) versus attacker vantage point (Internet, LAN, VM-to-VM on same host). We'll show the minimum timing delta we were able to distinguish at each point, given a certain number of samples.<p>The previous best results in this area were 20 microseconds Internet, 100 nanoseconds LAN with about 1000 measurements (Crosby et al). We have improved a bit on this (too soon to give exact numbers, wait for the talk).<p><a href=""http://www.cs.rice.edu/~dwallach/pub/crosby-timing2009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.rice.edu/~dwallach/pub/crosby-timing2009.pdf</a><p>Nearly every OAuth and OpenID library we found was vulnerable. No one has fixed these kinds of things. That's sad because they are exploitable in some configurations and as a software developer, you never fully know your customer's threat model. They could be running on Slicehost and have attackers literally on the same machine or a single server on a WAN link locked in a vault. (Usually the former more than latter.)<p>We hope our talk helps developers take this kind of attack more seriously but also dispel some of the FUD that these are easy. I think a good conclusion to make is ""timing attacks are easier than I expected (but not easy) so it's worth fixing them.""",1279341511
1523313,comment,1522352,1523165,0,0,daeken,,,"I may be wrong on this, but if you know the mechanism by which it's hashed, then there should be nothing stopping you from doing the hashing on your side as well, and timing the hash comparison.  So if 'foo' hashes to 'abcdef' and 'bar' hashes to 'ab0012', and it takes longer for 'bar' to be checked than 'foo', that tells you something about the hash it's comparing against.  Obviously in the real world this is significantly more difficult as it's tough to generate data that hashes to what you want it to, but I don't see why such an attack wouldn't be possible.<p>(Of course, this could be completely different than what the parent was thinking about.)",1279341313

I wonder if the founding fathers ever envisioned the government, under the framework they laid down, commanding 40% of the economy.  I doubt it.<p>In my opinion, and I like to assume that was the goal of the founders, the decisions of the government should not carry that much weight. But as it is, as they've taken over so much of the economy, and the money supply, and setting interest rates, this is no longer the case.  Specific measures were laid down in the constitution to prevent this, which is why they never considered it I suppose.",1279341190

1523302,comment,1523084,1523175,0,0,btilly,,,"There are lies, damned lies, and SLAs.  Personally I only find an SLA useful if it is worthwhile.  Most of the SLAs out there aren't.  And for good reason.  You should probably offer one, but like a smart company shouldn't make the burden too bad.<p>Suppose someone doesn't respond to a page.  Is it because they were too far asleep to hear the paging device?  Because the paging device didn't work?  Because some other problem kept them from working on the page remotely?  Because their carrier blocked the page?  Because you broke down?  Because the problems in their system kept them from sending you the information in the first place?<p>There are a lot of points of failure.  And your service is not one of the more likely ones to break.  Furthermore if there is a dispute, whose records win?  They didn't respond to a page, your records say they never sent the page.  They blame you, how do you resolve that?<p>Therefore I'd suggest offering an SLA, but make it be something like, ""If you missed a page and are convinced that it was our fault, we'll refund the last X months.""  From your point of view it is a no questions asked refund policy, that carries with it the consequence that that person is not allowed to sign up for your service.  (Unless, of course, you're convinced it was your fault they didn't receive their page.)  But whatever you do, be careful not to accept potential liability for something that likely was their problem.<p>I would also suggest that you share best practices.  For instance an important one is that companies need to provide a well-defined escalation path.  Recognize that humans fail (whether because of not waking up, being in the process of driving, etc) and so people are unreliable components that need a fall-back mechanism.  The act of educating your clients about things like this will help them avoid problems that could cause them in an imperfect world (ie the one we live in) to become unhappy with you.",1279340513

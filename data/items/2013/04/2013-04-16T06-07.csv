Same story with the Bulletin Board Systems of the 70s (The Matchmaker) and the punch cards at Stanford in the 60s (Happy Families Planning Services, used on the IBM 650) for the purposes of online dating. Today, it's much more pervasive with 75% of singles in the U.S. having tried online dating. Most of the women I've talked to on OkCupid are not technical, and when I setup a fake account to see what types of messages girls would receive, none of the people who initiated contact were hackers.<p>I still don't think the mainstream understands what BitCoin is, or why it's valuable. They hear things like ""anonymous"" and then wonder what they'd need that for, not seeing that the earliest users of BitCoin were hobbyists, hackers, and Silk Road members. If anything, hopefully this will push people to become BitCoin users, assuming the sign up process is easy enough and the price difference is enough to make them switch.",1366095575

I'm looking to replace my ageing 13"" 2008 MacBook unibody. The budget will either get me the standard spec 2.6i5 rMBP, or a 2ghz i7 MBA with 8gb ram. On paper it's a no brainier, get the pro. But having read about screen lag I'm not so sure. Plus it will spend 90% of its time hooked up to a monitor, so is it worth it? Is the screen lag that noticeable to make the 10% of the time I use the flash screen? No point suffering UI lag if I'm using a non retina monitor all the time.<p>I also suspect that I'd use it at a higher res than the 'retina' 1280x800.<p>If the Pro didn't exist, I'd get the Air without a worry. The higher res screen than my current one is great, plus it's fast enough without a doubt. Various geekbench scores and other measures place the upgraded Air on a par with the Pro. And the ports are plenty for me.<p>Any thoughts?",1366095525

At the time, my skills were basically photoshop, the (relatively extensive) programming classes I had as a child in high school, and some knowledge of markup.<p>I did about 80 sites for the guy over 8 months plus countless odd jobs like domain name transfers, troubleshooting email problems, writing annoying forms (the first routine I wrote that really solved a problem for me was a short bit to take a keyed array of field names and labels to generate/validate/process a form based off those values)... I spent almost all my free time on educating myself about whatever I though would be useful, and built sites for myself and some ""on the side"" clients in Joomla, Drupal, and WordPress.<p>I also had to hire and help manage a three-person technical team and deal with all the over promising that the sales guy would do.  This was a good education in and of itself.<p>At the end of that period, I reasoned that the sales guy/owner could sell websites not knowing how they worked, I could probably sell 1/10th the number of websites and double my income.  So I sold two local web sites and quit... it didn't hurt that my income was already only around $16/hr with no benefits, so replacing that was not a big deal.<p>For the next six months, I sold more sites and did a whole lot of cold calling and contacting folks via craigslist, and found an agency client who would pay 20/hr and give me plenty of work, and then using the same process I found an agency who would pay 30/hr, and for the last year I've been at around 65/hr and as busy as I'd like to be.<p>Mostly, after the first few craigslist clients, my new business comes from personal referrals.  It doesn't hurt that I make myself very available, I'm quite friendly, and I do a whole lot of free consultation that I consider to be business development-- people are really happy to direct work to folks who are helpful.<p>I don't usually sell work directly; mostly I work with agencies in Austin who are marking up what I am doing by around 50%.<p>I brought in around 65K last year, which is not great, but I also worked a lot of 4-day weeks (if I don't count checking in and doing a half hour of work on a late Friday, or occasionally spending a Sunday reworking something that had to be done ASAP) and I usually am able to do my work in two 3-hour sessions... still no benefits, but I am young and paid off a substantial chunk of the student loans accrued pursuing an unfortunate PhD in English.<p>By studying consistently, playing with new technologies, and being willing to take on a lot of work on odd jobs troubleshooting stuff, I've gotten to where I can build modules for Magento or aMember, themes and plugins for WordPress, and generally working in clean, patterns that seem elegant and satisfying.<p>I've learned how to deploy AWS EC2s, how to work on the *nix command lines, git, ssh, enough SQL to understand joins and how to root through a database and make changes to an entire managed site at once... nothing awesome or special, but stuff I find interesting and fun.<p>My feeling is that I have just started getting a ""good"" grasp on programming, but if I can keep this going for another couple of years then I might actually get good at programming... I'm getting a little tired of doing marketing oriented work, but to be honest my skills up to the last year really weren't all that unique (other than the fact that people like working with me for whatever various reasons).<p>I hope that is helpful for you... as I said, I am currently idled for personal reasons and am both cleaning out my development machine, the last couple of projects on my plate... and reevaluating what I'm doing, so it was helpful for me to write all that out.",1366094578

5556626,comment,5553543,5556251,1,0,nandemo,,,"I think they're very different arguments. uber is saying that this incident is relatively insignificant, since more people died of heart attack today. Schneier is saying that (i) we overstate the impact/probability of terrorist attacks. Note that this is not the same as merely comparing number of bombing deaths with deaths from natural causes; if this was happening every week, surely it would be considered a worrying development, even if the number of daily bombing deaths was still less than deaths by heart disease or car accidents. And (ii) that we should refuse to be terrorized as that gives power to terrorists.<p>I think (i) isn't a very solid argument since we can't estimate the probability of future terrorist attacks the same way we can calculate the probability of winning the lottery, or as we can estimate the probability of <i>x</i> deaths by heart attack in the next 5 years. For example, suppose we count the number of bombings against civilians in pre-2nd-intifada Israel. In 1999 there were 2 bombings. In 2000, when the intifada started, 5. In the following 2 years, 40 then 47. I haven't checked, but I suppose the same pattern would hold for pre- and post-invasion Iraq (note that this isn't an argument pro or anti the invasion).<p>I'm not saying that the same thing is likely to happen in the US, I'm just pointing out a weakness in the argument. Overall, though, I think Schneier has a point.",1366094263

In fact it has often been the opposite. In fact, now that I've looked over just the last year, most of the times Apple issues a press release its shares close the same day or the next below the level they were at the day before the announcement.<p>Out of 40 times Apple put out a press release in the last year, more than three-fourths of those times the stock declined that day or the day following (31 times). And only once did a positive trading day coincide with a new product announcement. The exceptions were:<p><pre><code>   Dec. 17, 2012 (iPhone 5 First Weekend Sales in China Top Two Million)
   Nov. 19, 2012 (AC/DC Now on iTunes)
   Nov. 5, 2012 (Apple Sells Three Million iPads in Three Days)

I'm pretty sure this has been the trend throughout Apple's history. The worst stock days seem to come when Apple has great news to report. At any rate, Wall Street surely does not care about Apple's new product announcements, at least not when it comes to shelling out for stock. Product sales or downloads, sometimes. New products, very rarely.<p>It's something I noticed in the early 2000s when I was a Mac reporter and very in tune with Apple's PR/IR efforts, but it's not something I actually consciously tracked, and I've already wasted enough time on something that doesn't affect me except as a curiosity.<p>Anyway, it never made sense to me the way good news from Apple translated into declining stock prices.

What they're scared of is not so much the remote possibility of being a bombing victim, but the complete lack of control they would have in such a situation. there's a much higher chance of being in a car accident than in a bombing, but you can mitigate your risk of a car accidnet by paying attention to your own and others' driving, and in most cases you'd have the opportunity to take some evasive action. Likewise you can mitigate your risk of getting mugged by not going into dangerous neighborhoods or suchlike. And so on.<p>If you're the victim of a bombing, on the other hand, you probably won't have any warning or any time to do anything about it. By the time you figure out what's happened, you're already maimed/ dying/ dead, or one of your loved ones is, or whatever. Remote though the risk is, the randomness and immediacy of it are a lot scarier. I've been in close proximity to a car bomb; it's shocking because it's a lot bigger than you are, and whether you are a victim or not has absolutely nothing to do with your skills or reaction time, it's purely a matter of luck.<p>It's like getting killed by a falling tree or a sinkhole opening up under you or something. The risk of that actually happening is tiny, but what's scary is how helpless you would be if it did.

I'm from India too.. and kamaal.. you seem to be stuck in the small college student protests about reservation around 7 - 8 years ago.<p>Yeah, may be. Most people who come from a middle class general category are going to suffer from reservations. Because they will be doing all the hard work only to watch someone who scored some thing like half their marks eat all their opportunities.<p>>>Nobody wants to be born in a lower caste. In the end, such comments are just jokes.<p>Have you ever visited a local Taluk office? Say some where in Bangalore? Do you even know how much bribe is given simply to obtain a OBC certificate because some one needs a job, or to get a seat and doesn't have the required marks to get one?.<p>>>So, i have to ask... whats your angle kamaal.<p>Let me put it the other way, what's your angle. I've put my views clear.<p>You should elaborate how denying the hardworking general category students their due chance is helping the country.<p>>>Also, your rant here is only against the backward sections of society, which have been denied equal opportunities for ages and have now become a political pawn in the reservations fiasco.<p>So is this now a revenge cycle? Are we supposed to make the general category suffer because some 20 generations back a ancestor of their made a mistake.<p>>>I question this, because India, as you know has reservations for women too, already in many educational institutions, pending in the parliament.<p>Last time I checked most women who stand for elections in my area were the wives of most prominent rowdies/mafia types.<p>>>So, instead of quoting something relevant like the impact of various reservations the country has implemented for women, you seem to just pout out your own agenda.<p>>>Don't wanna make the world a better place? Please don't try to make it worse.<p>Sorry you need to give your agenda, not me.<p>And how are you making the world a better place by denying the hardworking their due chance. And taking all their opportunities and giving to some one who probably didn't do 1/10th the work they do.",1366093147

Consider something like PostGIS: it's an entire first-class geospatial system done entirely as an extension (I don't think any other database can claim that).<p>It's still basically a batteries-included distribution, but it is very extensible and getting more so. I expect to see many more domain-specific extensions (you can already see a lot at <a href=""http://pgxn.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pgxn.org</a> ).<p>However, I will say that it should be a simple core but not <i>too</i> simplistic. Especially for something like a database, some things are better done in the core (perhaps not inherently, but it's in research-project territory). That's really the challenge: it's not ""pro-modularity"" versus ""anti-modularity""; it's about what constitutes a good base from which to build.",1366093024

5556547,comment,5555834,5555834,3,0,cmccabe,,,"I don't agree with the idea that there should be no standard library.  There is a lot of benefit to having a big standard library with code for common tasks like manipulating strings, performing network I/O, or formatting text.  Sure, you might be able to improve on the standard library, but the next person who has to maintain your code probably won't thank you for using something weird.  And if your new thing is awesome enough, it might be added to the standard library in time.<p>Things like this were a big problem in C++.  In the early days of C++, literally nothing was standard.  Everyone ran around using his own string class-- ""std"" string was named aspirationally, not to reflect reality.  They all behaved slightly differently.  It has taken literally decades to get to the point where std::string appears in most new projects in the UNIX world.  (I think that Windows is still hosed, due to the continuing UCS-2 train wreck on that platform... but I digress.)  Similarly, there are 31 different flavors of smart pointer, and even a master C++ programmer won't know them all.  So much pointless non-standardization, so much cognitive overhead.<p>I'm also reminded of Perl's ""there's more than one way to do it"" and the ""enhanced job security"" that ended up providing for anyone who managed to sneak Perl into production.<p>There is value in modularity, but only when the choice you're giving to the library user is a valuable one.  Choosing whether to use a MySQL database connector or a Postgres database connector is good diversity.  Choosing which string class to use, or what we're calling BigInt this month, or which of 15 Regex libraries we're using today... that kind of diversity just gives you headaches and maintenance pain, nothing more.",1366092739

717708,comment,717620,717674,0,0,gaius,,,"<i>local technical work</i><p>That's only partly true. What matters is competitive advantage. No company is more competitive because its (say) email server is more reliable than its rivals. Therefore email is ripe for outsourcing. But in any area where IT/software/computation <i>is</i> a competitive advantage, that will stay in-house (possibly using cloud-like technologies, but that's not relevant to this analysis).",1248263505

717704,comment,716926,717610,0,0,mahmud,,,"FWIW, I too gave this a little more thought, and from an engineering prespective, found that my proposed solution would tightly couple UI with business logic if greater care isn't taken. I am sure it isn't much overhead in simple news.arc to selectively render UI elements based on the status of a post, for example, but in larger applications, feature-requests could lead to a lot of conditionals creeping into display rendering.<p>What we need is to study and consolidate ""Adaptive User-Interfaces"" (a well stablished field of study, btw) with software engineering, and specially the web (and even more specially, with respect to dynamic programming languages and in my case Lisp and CLOS.)<p>Something I have been doing lately was reverse-engineering a few google apps from their rendered HTML and minified JS. I don't wanna throw speculations around, but I think Google has some sort of a ""learning"" engine which adjusts the shown content to the estimated level of user expertise. They do this with a ""newbie cookie"". See the sources for any google apps help pages, for example, and you will see this:<p><pre><code>  var global_newbie_cookie = ""newbie_11"";

One of the engineers that built FB video: ""With this job [...] you can go home saying, I've changed the world.""<p>Really?<p>I guess I'd make a terrible FB/Google/Twitter/Whatever employee.  I understand that yes it's cool and communication is faster and easier than before, but - seriously - is it really world-changing?<p>The discovery of agriculture, the advent of organized religion, the dissolution of organized religion, the idea of self-determination, the harnessing of electricity - these things changed the world.<p>But adding a single feature to a single website - really?  Would someone who was cryogenically frozen just before FB video was put online, and then was unfrozen after, be able to comprehend the world they were living in?  Do the same thought experiment with organized religion.<p>""But people were skeptical of other world-changing technology or ideology at the time, too.""  Yes.  You're right.  And I'm skeptical now.  Doesn't make me wrong.<p>I understand that they're in California and that it's apparently fashionable to imitate Jobs-like megalomaniacal optimism about one's own importance.  I understand that  self-motivation requires them to believe that what they do is the highest cause, and that it's important for one's career to appear to be a Jihad on behalf of the employer.<p>And don't get me wrong, FB is a great website and a really useful one which I use regularly to find people.  But can we please agree that it's not world-changing.  Here's what's great: it doesn't have to be.  You do not <i>need</i> to be a hero.

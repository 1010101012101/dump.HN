It's not the Unix way or the highway, you also have Perl and a host of other scripting languages that <i>are</i> better than the stock tools in Unices.<p>The Lisp Operating System solved this problem by having a unified I/O format (S-expressions) and built the lexer and parser in the OS. The Lisp READ and WRITE operators are overloaded methods that parse and serialize Lisp code and data structures respectively. If your configuration syntax or programming language syntax is in fully-parenthesized prefix syntax (i.e. valid Lisp s-exps) you can read and write expressions, statements and functions (the grammar of which is all in your hands btw) right there in the shell, and from within all running programs. You could even redefine builtin functions from the shell. Imagine if you could shadow the definition of, say, fopen(3), the C function for opening FILE streams. You could instrument it to log all file access, and all the programs you fire up after this will have their access to files logged.

Organizations for writers palliate the writer's loneliness but I doubt if they improve his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his work deteriorates. For he does his work alone and if he is a good enough writer he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day.<p>For a true writer each book should be a new beginning where he tries again for something that is beyond attainment. He should always try for something that has never been done or that others have tried and failed. Then sometimes, with great luck, he will succeed.<p>How simple the writing of literature would be if it were only necessary to write in another way what has been well written. It is because we have had such great writers in the past that a writer is driven far out past where he can go, out to where no one can help him.</i>",1250501821

There are at least 5 different source code search engines, but I doubt any one knows any other engines except Google Code Search. With fefoo you only need to figure out that you are searching for source code and you have 5 different source code search engines to choose from. Same goes for the 40 other search categories there. If a music site like Seeqpod closes down you still have 10 other music search engines to choose from.<p>- With the toolbar its easy to search on multiple search engines. You don't have to type the search query again and again. But I guess that needs to be specified in the overlay the first time a user searches for anything.<p>- The back button should work on Firefox, Chrome, Opera and IE but I would need to test it again.<p>- I fully agree about the part about the documentation.<p>- As for monetization I made the application for my own use and there is hardly any cost for me to run it. It might look like a server side application but the whole thing is made in JavaScript and once you visit the website it gets cached on the browser and works from there. This not only increases the speed but also gives you access to all the 200+ search engines. Even if you set it as the homepage it will not take more than the about:blank page to load.

It combines two very weak ideas into an even weaker one: the elitist news thing and the Britcannica argument.<p>The elitist reasoning goes like this: MSM are only reporting MJ death stories etc. and this low-quality populism has cost them their readership. If they were to start doing serious reporting, all the clever people would come back and pay for their services. Of course, that's BS. The current reporting is directly created to reach the biggest audience, and it does. It works. The elites may go away ... but that's just a few eccentrics, who cares?<p>The Britannica argument is that distributed groups on the internet can never produce anything that is nearly as good as the stuff that is produced by experts. This is certainly true for art, but for Britannica it simply didn't work out: Wikipedia did produce quality articles and content.",1250500200

Any country or organization using nukes in warfare would suffer such a huge global backlash that it'd mitigate almost any tactical benefit. That's probably a large reason why the United States, Israel, and Russia, who've all had some pretty serious armed conflicts since getting their arsenals online, haven't used them at all.<p>I'm generally considered very pro-military in the crowd I run in, but I consider the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to both be in the top ten of WWII atrocities, and that's saying something.",1250499943

A 6K population gives you absolutely no help with advancing anything significant in your life. It may be heaven on earth, but unless you're already established and can work on the net exclusively, this will be the biggest constraint on you. It will very likely mean that for your entire life you'll compromise on doing something you can rather something you love.<p>My advice: move. Get out of this place as soon as humanly possible, and promise yourself that once you've established a good way to do something you love, you'll come back for visits as often as possible, maybe even once a week or for long stretches of time every now and then.

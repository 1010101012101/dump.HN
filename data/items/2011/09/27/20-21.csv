My too biggest concerns are:<p>1) In my area a static IP is extremely expensive and outside of my budget. This leaves Dynamic DNS.<p>2) From what I can tell, Dynamic DNS providers only map 1 domain to your account. I would like the ability point more than 1 domain to my personal server.

But the compensation that people in finance receive is often way out of proportion to the good that they do in the world (assuming that they are doing good, which they often aren't). What makes finance dangerous is that it is capable of taking many other industries down with it when it fails. But it is not in the best interest of people in finance to be careful. They can make more money taking big risks in the short term, so that's what they do.",1317154124

At StartupBus, the majority of our costs are covered through sponsorship.<p>2) BauerIT works with us on StartupBus every year and they have already offered a very reduced rate. This is slightly off-topic, but I second that they are amazing and highly recommended for all bus needs. It does seem to be more economical over the long run to buy a bus though. If you're interested in specifics, we can take this offline. I'll shoot you an email in a bit.<p>3) Looks like it won't easily be possible to run it for profit at prices comparable to caltrain (which is my goal), so I'm open to making it a community service (this also helps with setting expectations).

There is more to it than that but basically it is to allow failing fast and if possible degrade gracefully via fallbacks instead of queueing requests on a latent backend dependency and saturating resources of all machines in a fleet which then causes everything to fail instead of just functionality related to the single dependency.<p>The concepts behind Hystrix are well known and written and spoken about by folks far better at communicating these topics than I such as Michael Nygard (<a href=""http://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it</a>) and John Allspaw (<a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Anomaly-Detection-Fault-Tolerance-and-Anticipation-Patterns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Anomaly-Detection-Fault-T...</a>). Hystrix is a Java implementation of several different concepts and patterns in a manner that has worked well and been battle-tested at the scale Netflix operates.<p>Netflix has a large service oriented architecture and applications can communicate with dozens of different services (40+ isolation groups for dependent systems and 100+ unique commands are used by the Netflix API). Each incoming API call will on average touch 6-7 backend services.<p>Having a standardized implementation of fault and latency tolerance functionality that can be configured, monitored and relied upon for all dependencies has proven very valuable instead of each team and system reinventing the wheel and having different approaches to configuration, monitoring, alerting, etc - which is how we were before.<p>As for incremental backoff - I agree that this would be an interesting thing to pursue (which is why a plan is in place to allow different strategies to be applied for circuit breaker logic => <a href=""https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/issues/9"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/issues/9</a>) but thus far the simple strategy taken by tripping a circuit completely for a short period of time has worked well.<p>This may be an artifact of the size of Netflix clusters and a smaller installation could possibly benefit more from incremental backoff - or perhaps this is functionality that could be a great win for us as well that we just haven't spent enough time on.<p>The following link shows a screen capture from the dashboard monitoring a particular backend service that was latent:<p><a href=""https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/images/ops-social-640.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/images/ops-social-64...</a> (from this page <a href=""https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Operations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Operations</a>)<p>Note how it shows 76 circuits open (tripped) and 158 closed across the cluster of 234 servers.<p>When we are running clusters of 200-1200 instances the ""incremental backoff"" naturally occurs as circuits are tripping and closing independently on different servers across the fleet. In essence the incremental backoff is done at a cluster level rather than within a single instance and naturally reduces the throughput to what the failing dependency can handle.<p>Feel free to send questions or requests at <a href=""https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/issues</a> or to me @benjchristensen on Twitter.",1354431547

Right now, I'm reading Grant's  memoirs;  It's extremely self-effacing;  He speaks of some of his more heroic moments as a young commissioned officer as if he was walking home from the grocery store.   The book has interjections marked ""PUBLISHER:""  where it is explained that he received this or that medal or recognition for this heroic action that he had just described in such a humble manner.<p>Your storytelling style will effect who your story appeals to.   I mean, great storytellers can transcend styles, but for most of us?  we're writin' form letters.   And really? there's nothing wrong with that.<p>(I do think there is something wrong with the 'all nighter' myth, especially when told to people too young to know that it's a lie, but it's largely inseparable from the silicon valley mythos.)",1354431120
4860397,comment,4859973,4860303,4,0,tikhonj,,,"That's a complicated thing to say. Even unoptimized Haskell tends to be very good when compared with other high-level languages. (Space leaks are more of an issue, but they're not <i>that</i> bad and are more than made up for by Haskell's other relative virtues.)<p>So for most of your code--the parts that aren't tight and performance critical--it's good enough as is and you can just stick to writing normal, concise and (at least in my experience) very readable Haskell.<p>However, there are always going to be the sections of code that you absolutely must optimize. And this is certainly not trivial. However, even this isn't too bad, for two reasons.<p>The first is that much of the difficultly comes with a lack of familiarity: you may know how to optimize C++ or C well, but that knowledge is not going to apply too much. Haskell is very strange, but some people clearly manage to make it perform well consistently, so it's probably a matter of experience. A new C++ programmer will find writing heavily optimized C++ code difficult as well.<p>The other reason it isn't as bad as it could be is that it's <i>possible</i> at all. You simply can't write very performant Python, so you essentially <i>have</i> to drop down to C. In Haskell, this is also always an option; however, even the hard-to-optimize Haskell is still usually friendlier and easier to work with than C!<p>In some cases, by using the right libraries and rewrite rules, you can actually maintain most of Haskell's elegance (like being able to express your program as composed maps and folds) while still getting good performance.",1354431111

It works for him and it works for a lot of other people.<p>That said, I feel the need to warn others who are considering switching to a cloud-based development environment. There are some significant disadvantages to doing development on a remote machine. The biggest issue is that you are dependent on Internet connectivity. If your connection is down, you are dead in the water. If it's slow, you'll get frustrated. Connectivity is only going to get better, but the occasions when you're offline can be very memorable. Additionally, your choice of editors is rather limited. Whatever you use, it has to be terminal-based. A GUI editor like Xcode, Sublime Text 2, or Coda is right-out.<p>Now let's take a look at the advantages. Cost is mentioned. An iPad is $500-800. A cloud server is $20/month. A maxxed-out 11"" MacBook Air is just under $1800. If you throw it away after 2 years (instead of selling it), that's $75/month. In the same time, you'd spend $40-55/month for the iPad/cloud combo. Assuming normal bay area wages, the cost difference isn't worth caring about.<p>The iPad/cloud setup has one big advantage: battery life. An iPad will last 10 hours. Most laptops can barely do half that. But that's pretty much its only advantage. The laptop beats it in performance, capabilities (you can run VMs and test other OSes/browsers), ergonomics, and expandability. Laptops can also output to larger monitors.<p>After considering all these things, the best solution is whatever you're most productive using. If you find yourself away from power often, the iPad is your best bet. If you often have slow/nonexistent Internet connectivity or you like to plug into external displays, go with a laptop.<p>My most productive times are when I'm offline, so my weapon of choice is the 11"" MacBook Air. I load it up with the right documentation and virtual machines beforehand. Then I spend the next 5-7 hours writing prodigious amounts of code. At that point both myself and the Air's battery are spent.<p>Again, I don't mean to imply that the author is mistaken. I simply want to manage expectations for anyone considering following him.",1354430586

4860373,comment,4859973,4859973,26,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"Portability <i>is</i> still a good reason to use C++. If you want to be portable between Android and iOS, for example. C# on either platform requires you to ship an extra 10Mb of libraries, and (especially on older phones) adding C# overhead on top of everything else just doesn't make sense.<p>I write games, mostly, so performance does matter to me, though I'm not trying to squeeze ""every last bit of performance"" out of a chip. I just want some parts of the code to be entirely predictable in performance. So C++ and OpenGL are still my tools of choice. Been using C++ for years and would ace that set of interview questions (except possibly the list of algorithms in &lt;algorithms&gt;). And yet...I actually hate C++. It just happens to do the job better than anything else.<p>And it also happens to interface really well to a REALLY good scripting language, Lua.<p>To some degree I wonder why everyone focuses so much on Java or C#, when the amount of overhead code you have to write is similar in both cases to C++. Yes the languages are easier to understand, which is good, and they're often wrapped in IDEs that make it easy enough a monkey can produce code that will compile, but it still requires a lot of boilerplate to do just about anything. More than C++ in some cases, though not always. So much that they make the IDEs write a lot of boilerplate for you -- but the overhead is not only in typing out the lines, but in screens and screens of code that distract you from the actual problem you're trying to solve, and that you have to sift through to find the code with the bug you're looking for.<p>So I stick with C++ for things that need speed, and I use Lua for things that don't -- and I promise you that I can write just about anything in fewer (legible) lines of code in Lua than it would take to do the equivalent in C# or Java.

After all, Go essentially competes in the same space as Java and C#--it's a managed imperative language designed for use on a server.<p>Now, D and Rust are another story. After doing a bit of reading, I'm actually very excited about Rust. For me, Go is essentially completely useless: it fills the same niche as Java, C# or--far more importantly--Haskell or OCaml. If I need code that's relatively fast but don't want to sacrifice memory safety or the convenience of a high-level language, I can do much better than Go.<p>On the other hand, if I want really low-level access to the system, for whatever reason, I don't have many good choices. I could do C, but that's rather unsafe and unpleasant; I could do C++, but it's a gigantic, overly complex language and also rather unsafe and unpleasant and I could do D. (I've actually heard good things about D but have never tried it.)<p>Rust gives me the perfect alternative--a simpler, higher-level language that's more pleasant to use but still lets me operate at a relatively low level. So next time I need to do something like that (which, honestly, probably won't be soon), I'm almost definitely going to use Rust, even if it's in active development and changing all the time.<p>EDIT: In re-reading this comment, I have realized that ""high-level"" and ""low-level"" really aren't great terms (at least the way I'm using them). Particularly, they're not mutually exclusive: a language can both support a high level of abstraction and provide low-level systems access where needed. Of course, I can't think of any language that actually does this, but Rust seems very promising.",1354429463

4860291,comment,4858715,4859689,7,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I don't know of any good books on the subject. I have been studying the ideas since 1995 when I joined a startup called GolfWeb which was publishing a magazine about Golf on the Web. And the question came up ""What is this worth?"" and ""Would people subscribe?"" That lead to some interesting investigations into the how people value things. Then in the late 90's I was talking with a friend who was getting an MBA at Berkeley. We invented the 'time valued coke machine' over lunch one day, its a coke machine where you can buy a soda for 25 cents if you are willing to wait an hour to have it come out. For $2 it will come out right away.  Now this is a really really precise soda machine (has an atomic clock in it) so if you paid your 25 cents your ticket tells you exactly when a soda will fall out of it. Now you can sell <i>that</i> to someone for 50 cents, and if you're getting near the hour mark you might be able to sell it for $1 or maybe $1.50. So you have just created, and sold information for a profit of 100 - 500%. All when you thought you were buying a soda :-).<p>I started writing my experiences with this up but stopped when I went to work for Google on the advice of my lawyer. Its a discouraging thing to write/talk about because without context people think its crazy, so slowly over time, as context develops, and ""real world"" examples get played out, the notion that information can have its own set of economic principles becomes less foreign because it sure as heck isn't behaving like it ""should"" if it was bound by the old rules.<p>Anyway, three ways I've seen so far to add value to information is that its timely, its rare, or its distilled. An example of timely information would be stock trades, very valuable right at the time they happen to high frequency traders, less and less as it gets older until its basically worthless 15 minutes old. Continuing with the stock market 'rare' or 'precious' information might be insider information about a company, it has value because it creates context that others can't see, which gives it a value proportional to the advantage it conveys, and lastly distilled value. Remember our stock market trades? Well they were very valuable 20 milliseconds after they happened, worthless after 15 minutes, but when kept over the course of time new data can be distilled from that old information (like maybe a stock always rises in the third quarter). I discovered at a conference that the intelligence agencies call this last one the 'Mosaic effect' where any single piece of information is useless but together they allow new data to emerge.<p>Artistic creation however is always the ""best"" information in terms of value. It can create value greatly out of proportion to the cost to produce it.<p>Anyway, like I said, I've been thinking about this stuff for 15 years. :-)",1354428203

4860285,comment,4859882,4860164,10,0,lsc,,,"I've worked on a consumer network that did that.   It was a company wiring up apartment buildings in a college town.  They would drop 2 T1s into an apartment, then plug them into a FreeBSD box, with a proprietary QoS kernel module (this was the early aughts) and then they'd use 802.11 to connect up the people in the apartments.   My job was handling the FreeBSD box and writing ipfw rules to identify and prioritize different classes of traffic.  (I am blanking on the module name.  It was a long time ago.)<p>Obviously, the kids are going to absolutely trash that 3Mbps.<p>They were killed by DSL, which gave you way more bandwidth for way less money vs. the T1s.  Doing the same thing with DSL at the head doesn't work because QoS works by reordering the packets in the queue.  To get packets to queue, you need to know how big your pipe is, and you never know exactly how big your DSL pipe is.  (or, at least, that's how it looks to dumb sysadmins like me who only get to play with a server connected to the dsl modem through a ethernet port.)<p>Anyhow, my belief is that it's turned out to be cheaper to just buy more bandwidth.   Bandwidth is incredibly cheap, and it keeps getting cheaper every year.",1354428086

From my experience as son and now as father, what I really think is important is to have two parents with different characters and way of thinking. Because a kid will never think like you and react like you, being two with different ways to see the world is helping wonderfully to better understand your kid and help him/her to grow and develop him/herself.<p>Can these differences be found within a same sex couple? Most likely, also not in the same way as woman/man. Is it better 2 loving fathers instead of living alone in an institution, definitely.<p>Non exceptional same sex couples with children is a fundamental change in the society, we need to accept that it will take time for this change to become accepted.",1343419157

I've lived in the bay area my entire life, although I'm only 25 so I was young during the dot com bubble.<p>My feelings are that Zuckerberg made it ""cool"" to start a company again. People had such a bad taste after the dot com bust and starting a company was viewed as very risky from around 2000 to 2005. Then Zuckerberg came in with this amazing success story and now everyone wants to start a company again.<p>Sometimes it bothers me that people throw around the word ""startup"" so casually now. There's kids that are ""doing a startup"" but the only thing they're building is a gmail plugin or ""a better to-do list that will change the world"". We don't need any more of this crap.

This is more so, given that people at Khan Academy are responding positively to specific concerns on specific topics.<p>And unlike for-profit companies, all his work, from the most boring video to the best, are available to be criticized. We only see a few clippings from, most likely, the very best videos from for-profit companies.<p>I hope the real critics and the real skeptics, i.e., those who would like to make Khan Academy a success, will continue to bring their specific concerns to the table; and just not all the distracting noise.<p>(Now, it is strange that the authors while pointing out the exaggerated praise for Khan Academy, fail to point out the abuse that Khan had to endure.

The majority of programmers aren't computer scientists.<p>I am anti-college for two reasons:<p>1-I didn't have the outside-the-class experience you did. In fact I think this is a situation where the top students naturally congregate together, in college and then on HN, and don't really have an understanding of what the non-top students go through. Most of them aren't making connections with other tinkerers.<p>2-I got a EE degree, but in my late 20's I become a professional programmer. I was instantly better than almost every other CS major I was working with. The majority of programming is closer to craftmanship than to Engineering. I don't think the knowledge learned in a CS degree is applicable, or even useful in day to day programming. The bits that are, can be learned.<p>(by the way, if your counter-argument is 'well I did VERY_HARD_THING_X within my companies app, and I would never have learned how to do this without my CS degree', I would say you may be a computer scientist, but also the vast majority of programmers arent doing this.)<p>The fact is, you go to college to earn a degree that says 'you are properly trained in this field to get a job'. Any profession that can be learned outside of an expensive college environment, should be.<p>Any argument that involves 'well you also get these nice benefits on the side' is irrelevant.

I've been working on my similar site as a hobby for years. I've learned some things along the way.<p>1: Your results page is very busy with lots of options and graphs. You've actually gone beyond what I've done in the past. The stuff you've put together is pretty amazing and sweet looking, especially knowing how much work it is. However, the feedback I got in the past when I had lots of information on the screen was that it was too busy and intimidating. Honestly, now seeing someone else build a similar product I can see why people felt that way. It's like ""BAM! Here's everything, digest it now!""<p>2: Real time streaming of anything, in my opinion, is annoying and useless. This is an opinion and opinions are like.. well you know. I built a real time stream on my dev box to try it out, it streamed Twitter and Facebook in 2 columns. I searched for ""pizza"". I deleted the code and html with great prejudice and it never made it's way to my production box. There's a reason the Twitter interface just has a counter for new posts and doesn't actually stream them.<p>3. Your speed is nice, when I hit the page and did a search. The way you load the page I think is a bit nicer to the user than I'm currently doing. So I'll give you some advice, the way I'm doing it I'm not happy with. My idea is to make the ""loading..."" almost completely gone. The way I'm going to do this is to\nAccept http request\nkick off requests to api/cache\nreturn page layout which ajax requests to get the data that's probably already now in my cache<p>4. Think about the value of all the apis you are using and the information you present. You're doing a lot. You probably don't need to be doing as much as you're doing. For example, the pictures, why? As you built it they seemed really cool and you probably used them a lot. I did when I built something similar for my site. No one else used it. Lots of development time for something no one uses and you're going to support it through redesigns and such?<p>5. Make this site your primary search engine. No matter what you're searching for, use your site first. This will show you what it's strengths are and then you can focus on those. I determined my site was best for keeping up on topics I was interested in on a daily basis, or for finding product reviews. This is what I've concentrated on now and has really helped me slim my product down into something manageable.<p>Let me end this with I'm not trying to be competitor to you, and not looking at you as one. My site is a hobby. I've recently burned out and have gone back to building websites for fun rather than profit. It's a huge relief to think ""I'll fix that this weekend and if not the weekend after"". So I'm sincerely just offering you advice based on my own multi-year experience for developing in the space you're in. I wish you the best of luck, and hey if you make it good enoguh maybe I can just use your site and work on some of my other ideas :)",1343417581

That definitely restricts the set of potential candidates to a small subset of the set of ""Linux people"" (people from gov't labs, research universities, very large corporations, etc.)<p>Since we're willing to pay relocation expenses and buy people out of non-competes, we were doing a nation-wide search, but as a generalization, university and gov't employees are usually there because they like the relaxed environment and are willing to sacrifice some pay for it. (I have worked at both, so that generalization is drawn from only my experiences and those of my friends.)<p>So after getting few bites there, we rewrote the job description to just be very good with Linux in general, hoping to get a really smart person with skills that complement ours and then being able to train them in the HPC-specific stuff. That increased the number of applicants, but also dramatically decreased the quality-applicant to applicant ratio.<p>You're definitely right that I could be misjudging the ability of some of the applicants, but a great majority can't pass the Linux equivalent of FizzBuzz, even though they list 10+ years of experience.",1343416740

In the case of rape, there would still be a widespread communal response to ostracize rapists, develop counter-technologies, etc., because normal people will not just sit idly by and accept the fact that they can't do anything about rapists. Somehow they just don't find the concept of <i>lost sales</i> as noble.<p>Copyright infringement is not the same as theft because theft forcibly removes a thing. Copyright protects against whole and independent <i>copies</i> that have no bearing on the physical item (whether a real, bound book or a string of digits stored on a disc). This is why people are charge with ""copyright infringement"" instead of ""burglary"" when they violate copyright law.<p>You're right that I didn't address each point independently and consistently. I didn't believe this is necessary; my post wasn't about the moral implications of copyright adherence or copyright violation or why some people believe it's theft, but about the practicalities and futility of Big Media's ""fight against piracy"".

Whatever activity I have online is something that I don't care about others finding out about (similar to not uploading pictures to Facebook that I wouldn't want seen).  This is the front page check: anything you wouldn't want on the newspaper cover, you don't do.<p>2. For things that I DON'T want known, I consider using anonymity tools such as TOR (I've never needed this thus far).<p>3. For sensitive data, I just don't store it on the internet.  If I ABSOLUTELY need to do so, I use client side encryption, such as TrueCrypt.  I would recommend doing that if you store sensitive or personal data in dropbox as your example suggests.<p>We also currently have nothing to suggest that Google will be monitoring the pipes (at least any more than any ISP), so one can assume that Google won't know about anything more than they do now.<p>Once you realize that most of the data you submit online is used, read and sold by the services you provide it to and accept that fact, you can start seeing your online identity as something precious you don't goof around with.  For those reasons, I can't see Google getting any more intrusive in my life than it is now by controlling the pipe: they (or other corporations) already control most of the services I wilfully submit my data to.<p>At this point, I stop seeing those services (Google, Facebook, etc) as free and instead treat them with caution, while understanding that I pay them in data instead of money.

The problem with this method is that discovery(arguably the most important part of what Twitter provides) is still reliant on a third party's index.<p>From a user's perspective, Twitter provides 3 key services from one URL:<p>1.  A unified feed for everyone you follow(This proposal also does this).<p>2.  An easy way to post/host content(This proposal does not deal with this).<p>3.  An easy way to discover new people to follow(This proposal also does not deal with this).<p>Out of those three, I would argue that the second and third are the most important.  The problem isn't getting the message out to people that are already subscribed with Twitter, email, or a hosted website.  The problem is discovery, and giving people an easy way to actually find the information that they're looking for.<p>The only way to handle discovery on this way is to have some hosted, third party method of searching through the users to find the ones you want to follow.",1343415684

A virtual machine.<p>4. A security model.<p>As a systems admin, I play mostly in 3, deploying, tuning, configuring, monitoring (to the extent that piss-poor Java tools allow any sort of monitoring -- want a dump of what's in memory?  Sure ... let's just pause <i>ALL</i> activity on the VM for the next 25 minutes), troubleshooting, and patching/updating the VM.<p>I'm also concerned with the security model, within the parameters of my other system security concerns.<p>For the language and class libraries, it's largely ensuring that what my devs need and use is provisioned on our test, staging, and production hosts.  There's also digging through some of the logging / crash / debug output to see if I can sort out what's wrong and fix it myself, or punt it over the wall to Engineering.<p>So no, it's not just developers.",1343415641

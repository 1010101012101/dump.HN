And if you look at studies of people who are caffeine dependent, they're not actually are more alert after drinking a cup of coffee than people who aren't caffeine dependent and don't drink coffee.<p>The other answer is that if you're using caffeine from plants then you're getting a different dose each day, and if you're not taking a lot and you're not doing it every day then tolerance will be less of an issue. Also, caffeine breaks down into multiple separate drugs when digested so that may also have some impact on tolerance.",1347587908

4519625,comment,4519228,4519228,13,0,alttag,,,"Wow. That's neat.<p>I once had a conversation with a state legislator where he argued it wasn't the responsibility of government to provide grant and loan opportunities for higher education, and that by doing so, the federal government was disincentivizing saving and investing. Instead, he argued universities should be more market driven (which I will concede might introduce more price competition in the face of rapidly rising tuition rates). He was a firm believer that a university education should be something one works and sacrifices for.<p>In my elected position with public education at the time, I disagreed (and still disagree) with some of his claims, believing a subsidized higher education experience for a expanded pool of people is a long-term net gain compared to crime/prison costs and the cost of government-funded social safety net programs. (Although, again, college-student families admittedly qualify for most government assistance programs already, but this is hopefully a short-term rather than lifetime dependence.)<p>I'd love to see the long-term effects on the quality of life, debt, and employment prospects of these students.",1347587704

Let's just say that you can't --and should not-- reach such conclusions from the very limited view I chose to share with you in a short post.  I am condensing over a decade worth of experiences into a few paragraphs.<p>Here's a short one.  Imagine this:  A competitor asks you to meet, under NDA, to discuss licensing your product.  ""Can you build one for us with these features?"" is the theme of the meeting.  After lawyers do their thing, NDA's and other documents are in place, the meetings get started.  These are deep technical meetings with information being shared for the purpose of developing a licensed product.  Then, the talks end abruptly with no communication from the other side.  Six months later they show-up at the next tradeshow with the very product you helped them understand, explore, diagram and almost get to market.<p>Here's another one:  You hire a consultant to design a product for you.  The consultant doesn't really know the field but he is capable.  You, effectively, pay this person to learn on the job and design a widget for you.  He does.  Then, a few months later, after having learned the technical bits and also about the market opportunity, he launches a company with a competing product for less.  You, effectively, paid for the ""R"" in ""R&D"".  All he had to do was the ""D"".<p>These are not hypothetical situations.  These actually happened.<p>99% copying and 1% something new?<p>Have you ever competed in anything?  Say, swimming.  Do you know how hard it is to get 1% better than world class?  How about building a race car that is 1% better?  C'mon, all you have to do is copy 99% of the design and then improve only 1% of it.  Go do it and then come back and tell me how trivial it is to innovate just 1% of something already at the state of the art.  I don't know one person who goes through such and experience that would make the kinds of comments you made.<p>Let's all hold hands, sing kumbaya and smoke one.  Right.",1347587076

4519563,comment,4518917,4518917,9,0,robomartin,,,"Argentina has great people.  It also has a culture of horribly corrupt and self-serving governments.  The name of the game, if you are in government, is to cheat, lie and steal.  Every one of those fuckers has nicely padded bank accounts out of the country somewhere.  The've robbed that country out of so much it is hard to describe.<p>I lived there for many years.  I saw it first hand.  I also became aware of the history and how corruption and manipulation has been a core part of governmental culture.<p>In conversations with friends I can't help but draw parallels between what has happened in Argentina over the decades and what happens in the US.<p>One of the most famous examples of government manipulation and vote-buying was when Evita (way back when) would show-up at neighborhoods and hand out bikes, refrigerators, blenders, etc. to the population.  Of course, they were buying votes.  Same with their ""sindicatos"" (unions) and other groups.<p>These governments have used the guise of socialism (down with the rich, etc.) to drum-up popular support and remain in power.  The reality is that most of them should probably have been tried and thrown into prison for treason.<p>In the US the Democratic party exhibits some of these traits.  The corruption in places like Argentina is very obvert. It's amazing how everyone knows about it and it is very much a matter of daily national conversation.<p>Here in the US it used to be more subtle.  Not now.  Democrats openly channel benefits towards government and private unions as a way to buy their votes.  If a being from another planet landed in the US and listened to Obama speak it would conclude that the only important people in this nation are ""teachers, police, firemen and construction workers"".  Why?  Because that is all he mentions in his speeches.  Translated: ""union, union, union, union"".<p>If you succeed in buying union (""sindicato"" in Argentina) votes you are buying the votes of their immediate family as well as all union retirees.    That amounts to millions upon millions of people.  Brilliant, if you think about it.<p>It goes far deeper than this.  The Argentinian goverment figured this out a long time ago.  Create class divisions.  Get those on the dole worked-up about those with money.  This guarantees millions of easy votes and you remain in power.  It is also easy when this ideology permeates colleges and universities and kids come out of school actually believing this shit.  If you are a college or university graduate, pull way back, realize that you may have been subject to indoctrination and try to see the world for what it actually is before parroting what your radical professors told you.<p>What's sad about this is that, both here and in Argentina, it all comes at the expense of the country in general.  Those in power remain in power and live the good life (Another vacation or golf trip Mr. Obama?) and truly live outside of the realities of the country.  The masses get their blenders, bikes, refrigerators, playstations, bonuses, etc. and buy into the idea that they are being oppressed by everyone and are entitled to take from everyone in order to live.  The country goes to hell and nobody wins.  Our kids will have to deal with the real consequences of this mess.<p>Argentina is a warning to everyone in the world.  Watch and learn.  See what can happen when government goes wild and acts not for the benefit of the entire country but for themselves and nobody else.  Manipulating the masses is a tried-and-true way to acquire votes with few, if any, real consequences after the fact.<p>I have friends who still live there.  Some have businesses and are terrified.  Some are doctors and are living from paycheck to paycheck --if they get paid at all.  Nearly every Argentinian has stories of someone getting held-up, sometimes at gun-point, when coming or leaving home or going about their daily life.  The government does nothing.  And, in fact, a lot of these criminal elements end-up being the voting masses that support them (living in favela-type encamptments all over the place).  It's amazing to see people who live like shit support the very party that keeps them there.  In the US that's welfare recipients.  Legalized vote buying.  How many welfare recipients do you think ever vote Republican?  How many people in Argentina do you think vote for political parties who will take away their entitlements and put them to work for their own benefit and that of the country.  Right.<p>The solutions to these problems can only evolve internally.<p>In Argentina I am afraid that it might be so far gone that only a major event, such as nation-wide unrest and an ousting of the government can ever hope to find a solution.  This wouldn't be the first time this would happen over there.<p>In the US it is still thankfully quite civilized.  All you have to do is be intelligent about how you vote and things can change.<p>As a Libertarian I have to make a choice between two parties that don't quite represent me.  So, in many ways, it is about the lesser evil.  Casting a vote for a Libertarian candidate would, at this juncture, be irresponsible.<p>Casting a vote for the Democratic candidate would be even worst.  The last thing this country needs is more union workers earning $300K for life when they retire.  I could not, in good conscience, saddle my kids and the generation after them with that ridiculous burden.<p>And, while I don't necessarily agree with all of the Republican platform (I'm an heterosexual atheist and don't have issues with gays at all) I must cast my vote in their favor.  I, for one, would really like to see what a real businessman could do with the mess we have created in the US over the last fifty years.<p>Obama was an exciting bet in 2008.  In retrospect, the guy wasn't even qualified to run a cookie baking operation, much less an entire country.  We made a mistake.  I hope we all fix it in November.",1347585917

I've done it myself for fairly large pieces of code (not this big.) In this case, it was for a hack week project and was a modest amount of code. It sounds like they got buy-in from the rest of the team that using CoffeeScript is a net win. It sounds like they are moving forward, it was a good decision and use of time, and they are happy with the result. Why do you think you can make arguments that it is in fact not any of these things, when the people who did it are stating otherwise, and the organization is acting otherwise? Why do you think you can make arguments against re-writes that suggest avoiding them because they never ship, when this project has, in fact, shipped, and did so in a week? Either you are missing something, or Dropbox is deluding themselves and are just falling for hype. What do you think is more likely?",1347584551

Nearly every hotel room has a big old manual separate bolt set up higher and away from key based locking system. Slides open maybe 2 inches etc. Twice in my life the hotel person has given my room to someone else by mistake (I travel a lot for work). That is, I'll be in there, twice late at night, and someone else puts in a key and it works. After the first time I always set that manual bolt no matter what - just in case. Not that I think there's any real merit to the original point that kicked off this particular thread.",1347584530

Right now, it's one of the best online communities for quality of content.<p>People who call Quora a nasty community because of downvoting have no idea what they're talking about. Wikipedia in 2004-5 was nasty. Personal attacks all over the place, edit wars and tag teaming (troll raids by influential people, justified by the ""3 revert rule""). There was one guy who created a bunch of sock puppet accounts and attempted to attribute them to me on a still-infamous hate page, in which he claimed about 50 accounts, most nonexistent, were my sock puppets when many of them were later established to be his. (Half the accounts weren't used for anything but have obscene names.) <i>That</i> is what I call nasty. Downvotes on Quora aren't anywhere close to that.<p>I haven't seen Quora get even on the same planet as what Wikipedia was when I last edited (which was more than 5 years ago).<p>I don't agree with the decision to collapse answers based on 1 downvote, but if I'm really interested in a question, I'll usually read all the answers anyway, so I don't find it to be a major hindrance. Besides, being downvoted isn't a big deal: fewer people read your answer; so what?<p>Quora's great, at least from my experience. It might be that I stay away from extremely charged topics (e.g. politics) but I've never encountered any of this stuff-- and I've seen it a lot on other internet communities.",1347584456

4519503,comment,4519094,4519094,1,0,dmils4,,,"few takeaways (having just gone thru the same experience of launching our first app in July)<p>1) don't assume that because you're bootstrapping, you ""have to charge something for the app"". View free/paid as two different marketing channels (that's really all that they are). With free apps - they are ad, in-app purchase and/or lead supported - while paid apps support themselves. There is no right or wrong way to monetize, but by having one of each, you're eligible in both top app chart categories, which helps.<p>2) you may have benefited from this (or maybe you didn't) - but one thing that surprised me was the market for ""apps gone free"". We released our app as a free app at first, but once the downloads started to fall off, we figured ""what the hell, let's make it paid"" after which we rose even higher in the rankings on the paid side than we ever achieved on the free side. Then when paid installs started to fall off, we switched the app back to free, which had a surprising result: it got picked up by all of these ""apps gone free"" feeds (tons of blogs subscribe to app pricing updates - so it was suddenly eaten up by this niche market of users who download all of the apps that recently became free). Granted - these weren't engaged users, but it padded download stats for a few days. When that happened we experienced our best two free install days ever before normalizing again.<p>Interesting to see your stats, thanks for sharing.",1347584434

If you have a scatterplot, you can draw a pretty nice linear approximation through it. I sort of think of this type of advice as the experienced person throwing a line through their one point and then trying to orient that line as best they can. Personal stories make great content for a blog, and it's true, when taken in the context of other people's experiences they can be of great help, but the urge to generalize and present them as a method is something that's usually better off avoided.",1192928393

70780,comment,70711,70726,0,0,Elfan,,,"The author didn't specify how large his project was.  If it involves a <i>lot</i> of servers then Gentoo's ability to basically ""make your own distro"" could prove very useful.  You can't get much more flexible than that.  Since the OP is coming from  a BSD background that is an advantage for Gentoo as well.<p>On the other hand if the project just involves a small number of servers than Gentoo will likely prove more hassle than it is worth.  In that case the conventional wisdom would be Debian. (or RHEL if you want to pay someone for support).",1192926625

Because we know the triangle inequality holds, all our results must have at most distance d+n and at least distance d-n from test.<p>Can anyone please explain me in more simpler terms.",1192925818

I had pretty low expectations coming in -- I think the blog is great but couldn't see it hanging together as a full book -- but they have been easily surpassed.<p>Barnes and Noble filed it under author name ""F"" for ""Fake Steve"" in the humor section -- took a little while to find it.

J2me, is basically Java 1.2 with lots of things stripped out. No string tokenizer, no iterators, no collections, etc. etc.<p>This actually makes it frustrating (re-invent the wheel all the time), yet challenging fun at the same time  (it is not bloated).<p>THe main problem of J2ME is it's very crappy implemetation from OEM,  where every fricking manufactor decides to implemt it differently, slapping their apis, and making applications not work on most phones without some major effort.<p>Carriers, deciding to bllock APIs, as basic as socket connections, media players, etc.  and you can't use them without their  ""permission"", aka digital signatures.  Ah, and if you are not their ""preferred"" partner (i.e. surrender half of your revenue to the carries), you will not get this certificates.  Which stilfes inovation, and  drive small developers, or early startups out of business, unless they are in bed with the carrier.<p>So, after years developing with J2ME, I can say that it has a leased time.  It is not easy to develop for, very very fragmented, and it's power stiffled by the carriers.",1192924963

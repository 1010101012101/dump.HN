1482884,comment,1482834,1482834,0,0,pedalpete,,,"First off congrats, and well done on a nice looking and fairly clear site.<p>Unfortunately, your documentation link doesn't go anywhere, and that is one of the first thing i look at when looking into API's. What does it look like, and how do they do it.<p>I'm in the process of building a site where most of the interactions are based around game mechanics. I'm just getting into it, and hadn't really thought about using an outside API, but you've at least given me pause to think about it.<p>However, going after already existing sites which want to add an element of game interaction is a good market I think.<p>A few things on your site specifically.<p>I found that the cycle on the home page rotates way to quickly to absorb any of the information. I know it stops once you click on one of the buttons below, but I found the initial speed to be a bit distracting.<p>The screenshot in the cycle goes below the dividing line/bar and looks wrong to me.<p>The light blue font used in each cycle title on the light grey gradient background except the first is difficult to read. Going a bit darker would help, or just stick with white. It isn't a problem in the cycle controls though, and looks quite nice.<p>You have a prominent link to your blog, but no blog posts. How about something about why you decided to build the company, how you got into it, something interesting. A blank blog just doesn't say 'dedication' to me.<p>You quote 'Jim Miller', but don't say what his site is. If he is in fact a real person, and they're using your api, I think it would be nice to send people to his site, and if somebody can see your api in action, it helps cross the barrier of having people be the first to deploy.<p>A live demo would really be great, but if that is too much to ask, a video demo would be a good idea. Though people may understand something about game mechanics, actually showing what you do is very important (to me at least).<p>Also, your sign-up and get the whitepaper forms don't look nearly as polished as the rest of the site. I'd clean those up a bit.<p>my 2 cents.
Best of luck",1278118634

Imaging there's a gigantic library that has every music title, movie, TV show, book and software made by man in their shelfs and everybody has free access. Sounds like a desirable thing.<p>Now the problem of course arises when content creators don't get paid anymore and therefore content creation becomes unprofitable or the quality of the products diminishes. But neither of these things seem to be happening. Not even in the slightest. Entertainment is booming, movies and games reach new heights of invest and profit each year and despite having now a generation of children that probably never bought a music album in there life, Apple will tell you the music industry is far from dead.<p>So it actually seems you can have both - a highly profitable digital content industry, while having said content available for free to everybody.",1278118615

I can't think of any clear benefit the televised coverage has brought to the legislative process, and extrapolating from existing coverage of the courts I suspect the vast majority of airtime would be spent on catering to the most prurient sort of public curiosity.<p>If one considers McLuhan's famous remark that 'the medium is the message,' it's hard to ignore the fact that the medium of television is awash in sensational trivia, relies heavily on emotional manipulation of the viewer to construct a compelling visual narrative, and frequently oversimplifies complex issues to the point of distorting the facts. Now this is no more the fault of broadcast technology or infrastructure any more than lies are the fault of the speaker's larynx or distant relatives; but the sad reality is that a great deal of television is the intellectual equivalent of a sewer, and whatever you drop into a sewer is going to end up getting dirty. It's a problem that law and the legal process are so obscure and inaccessible to the public - but not one that will be solved by turning courtrooms into studio sets.",1278117884

1482839,comment,1482591,1482730,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"That argument depends on showing how photo/videography of courtroom proceedings would provide substantially more information to the public than textual or graphical reportage does now. Is the public going to be any better off by having access to recording of a judge's furrowed brow or the steely glint in a prosecutor's eye? Because past experience has shown that such trivialities are the sort of material that gets replayed over and over on TV.<p>More seriously, consider the fact that people's attractiveness varies considerably, and a large part of our media is built upon selecting for visual attraction. What effect do you think that televised trials will have for plaintiffs, defendants, or witnesses who are ugly, or have a speech impediment, or whose attorney would come last in a beauty contest? It's a well-known fact that simply being taller correlates strongly with victory in presidential elections. Televised coverage of an emotive case mandates developing a 'charismatic strategy', and selecting for counsel and testimony based on their favorable visual impact - after all, this is the essential function of the casting process in narrative filmmaking (where I work). Once you go down this road you might as well go all the way: 'Your honor, I move for an extreme close-up of the witness, emphasizing his shifty gaze!' 'Objection! A cutaway to the defendant's cringing posture is clearly in order!'<p>On a more general note, your literalist reading of the 1st Amendment would grant the press the right to do anything at all - burst into your home while you're on the toilet, raid your bank account, murder people on live TV, and start shooting wars in the name of public curiosity about the potential outcome. By this logic, anyone who declares themselves to be a publisher and has an inkjet printer or a blog is exempt from any constraints as long as they provide regular updates on their field of interest. Strict construction that leads to absurdities is no better than implicit assumptions about the judicial branch's freedom to establish standards for its own operation.",1278116653

In discussing the oil disaster and the cleanup efforts so far, and why the latter hasn't been as effective as one might have liked, he cites just about everything <i>except</i> these 2 points, rather suspiciously:<p>1. new oil is STILL leaking into the Gulf -- cleaning now is a bit like running just to stand still, there will be more flowing out and hitting the beaches tomorrow, and the next day, and the next, etc.<p>2. BP/Transocean/Halliburton are primarily at fault, both for the original accident/leak, and for not stopping it quicker. I don't buy the argument that somehow because a government oversight agency was not as aggressive as it could have been, and/or was bribed BY these oil companies to back off and let them ignore rules that THEREFORE the government is anywhere near as at fault as the <i>oil companies</i> in question.

Electromagnetic fields are without a doubt outside of his area of knowledge. As an example when Johannson speaks about microwaves it's implied that these are comparable to X-rays and gamma radiation, despite the fact that it's two completely different physical phenomenon. The important parameters when discussing these phenomenons is frequeny and intensity. If these aren't specified then the discussion about dangers is meaningless. Even Olle Johanssons claims about ruptures in DNA-strings shows a lack of knowledge. As an example Johansson recently gave (Stockholms Fria Tidning 2004-12-24) an understatement on the natural occurance of such breaches with a factor of 100 000. Someone who wants to be taken seriously should at least be using the right scale for their numbers.<p>Lastly it's noted that Olle Johansson has claimed a long line of sicknesses, like cancer, blood preasure problems, asthma, allergies and insomnia, could be caused by electromagnetic fields. He claims that you can get skin cancer from tv- and radioemissions. Especially noted Johansson was a few years back when he claimed that brain damage and especially mad cow disease could be caused by mobile phones. (Aftonbladet 2001-03-12).</i><p>(From the Swedish Sceptics Society: <a href=""http://www.vof.se/folkvett/20051obestyrkt-om-farorna-med-elektromagnetisk-stralning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vof.se/folkvett/20051obestyrkt-om-farorna-med-ele...</a>)<p>Hes been making claims in this area of research since the 1970's according to his own bio page at Karolinska Institutet.

Might be better to plant a seed of ""thinking like a computer scientist"" and showing them the concepts of programming than teaching them binary.  (I was taught binary at 10, and never touched it again until college...when I had forgotten it all). What if students find your history of computers and computers 101 class too diffucult and not engaging...then you've turned those kids away from ever becoming really interested in Computer Science.<p>Do kids really care about ""really"" learning the science?  And it's true that a bunch of kids won't ever progress further than making some fun presentations, but what's wrong with that?  Not all those kids are going to go on to become computer scientists.  For those kids who are really interesting in programming and computers, they'll continue with it.<p>Creating things is a important part of learning.  If kids make fun presentations that they show off to parents and friends, they're gonna work hard on it.  Stepping through a program on a virtual computer enviroment doesn't really allow for that.<p>The class you're proposing sounds like a class I took in college.

That means that the buffer would be full (mathematically) every 5.6 years hence the ""every five or six years.""  In order to keep general season alignment, I figure they vary between the two.  This decimal doesn't go away until after 28 years - so I assume some combination of fives and sixes that add up to 28.  Lets say three sixes and two fives.  (18+10).  So in order to make any pattern they might do something like 6 5 6 5 6 6 5 6 5 6.  And now, looking at the leap years, I think my theory is confirmed: 2015-2020 (5)

3407751,comment,3407436,3407549,0,0,cbs,,,"Current conventional wisdom is that after Iowa, Paul will leave the ""top tier"" of the Republican race.  He has always been ignored by traditional media and this is the highest hes ever risen, so there is a possibility he may find the staying power.<p>To get to the meat of your question: why Paul now.  Paul has always been a solid choice for people dissatisfied with the traditional Republican party.  Many of his libertarian views speak to often ignored American ideals, and he is willing to tell it how he sees it, not the political-speak whitewash heard from everyone else.  His supporters even include voters who don't normally support the GOP (hes the Republican with the most significant youth following and I've met many people who would vote Democrat-or-Ron-Paul).  Hes showing strong now because the electorate has started to feel (like Paul supporters do) that the rest of the GOP field right now is in pretty bad shape.<p>There has been a sense of inevitability to Romney picking up the nomination, hes been near the top of all the polls since he entered the race, but it seems voters don't want to be stuck with him.  They've been scrambling around and sending a long line of candidates to the front of the polls, and inevitably once they get the spotlight they make an ass of themselves.  Then the voters send someone else to the top of the polls.  Right now is Paul's turn there (at least in Iowa).  It remains to be seen if he can stay there and defeat Romney, or if once voters get to know him better his numbers will start falling.<p>edit: <i>Or is Iowa special?</i> It is to Iowans, and any pundits who want to act like Iowa will be a bellweather of the country.  Really, they just go first.  The next races will be in different states, and after more time, and more news cycles so Iowa is not necessarily indicative of anything but the current opinions in Iowa.",1325256683

These are things that somebody else wrote in a newsletter that was using Paul's name. That doesn't mean that you should let Paul off the hook.

Consider Obama's association with the explicitly anti-American, anti-Semite minister Jeremiah Wright, and with the communist and terrorist Bill Ayers. Indeed, in my opinion, Obama comes out much dirtier in this comparison, because he refused to disavow those other people, and particularly Wright, who is acknowledged to have served (still?) as a mentor to Obama, shaping his thinking. In contrast, Paul condemns those statements, and there's no reason to believe that he ever took their writers' ideas as guidance.<p>More discussion of this here: <a href=""http://volokh.com/2011/12/22/libertarians-and-ron-pauls-racist-newsletters/comment-page-3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://volokh.com/2011/12/22/libertarians-and-ron-pauls-raci...</a>",1325254980

3407639,comment,3404807,3404807,0,0,oldprogrammer,,,"There are two main reasons we chose to use .NET for our startup.  The first is that .NET is what we know.  The second is Bizspark and its free use of Windows Azure.<p>--Bizspark/Azure--
We signed up for Azure, which took about 10 minutes to fill out a couple web forms describing what we were doing and provided a link to our ""coming soon"" page.  Five days later we were accepted and within 30 minutes we had our Ultimate MSDN subscription and Azure account created.  But it wasn't really about the MSDN subscription (which is a nice bonus, though), as we already had Windows 7 installed and we could have used the Express development products just as well as the ultimate ones.  In terms of licensing long term, we're not using any of the server licensing, as everything is hosted on Azure.  So we'll never have to endure the licensing hell people have referred to.  If in 3 years we're not able to pay our hosting bill on Azure then it's time to stop on working on this startup.<p>On Azure we're taking advantage of the two compute instances, the SQL Server database, and the Blob storage.  That's a powerful hosting framework for free.  The other options we were considering was Google App Engine with Python/Django, or Heroku with Rails.  We had decided on those 3 options because we didn't want to be sysadmins or feel like we needed to hire one. We wanted scability without having to think about it.  And since we're not working on a 100 million user project we're not going to need super-customized server optimizations.  Being pragmatic about it, going with GAE or Heroku would have been more expensive than free and would have required us to use languages and frameworks we were not 100% familiar with.<p>--Using what you know--
We would have been deciding to use Rails or Django ""just because"" with no real benefit.  Building a new product is hard enough without trying to learn a new language/framework/server/os.  In the past few years I've experimented with Ruby on Rails and various Python frameworks hoping to discover for myself the magic that had captured the hearts of so many developers, but I always kept coming back to .NET when it was a project that required me to be at my best.  Deep down I think I wanted to fall in love with Rails or Django because I prefer living in OSX over Win7.  Rails just felt like a mess to me, and Django just didn't click.  While there is a lot to like about Ruby and Python, my 7 years of experience using C# pays dividends in productivity.<p>--Lock-in--
People always mention ""lock-in"" when talking about .NET.  But the truth is that there is lock-in with whatever technology you sink your time into.  If you spend 6 months building a product in Rails/MySQL/Linux you're just as locked in as you would be if you spent 6 months building in .NET/SQL Server/Win64.  Many of the commenters have talked about needing to tweak the OS, tweak the web server, tweak the database server, etc.  If you're a new startup worrying about that, then you've already set yourself up for failure through premature optimization.  Focus on building your product and getting a few paid users.<p>Many have also stated that going with .NET means being stuck in MSland and unable to mix and match tech like you would be in OSSland.  I think that's a false dichotomy.  If we're talking about mixing a web framework with a database, for example, it's very easy to use .NET with Oracle, MySQL, Postgresql, MongoDB, etc.  In fact, it's probably easier than with Rails or Django where I remember having a heck of time getting drivers to compile on my Mac.  And these days, it's fairly common to use OSS tools with .NET.  Microsoft's own ASP.Net MVC, NUnit, Specflow, jQuery, Sass, Coffeescript, etc., to name a few.",1325254598

1482988,comment,1479790,1480285,0,0,10ren,,,"oh I see; I should have side ""aside/tangent:"". I was trying to validate one of the assumptions for my startup (""Java will remain in wide-spread use""), not argue within the discussion. I believe it will, but with so much negativity about java, I'd like to confirm it with facts.<p>Some facts are that many java jobs are advertised; but this doesn't really confirm where java is going... are they for new projects or maintaining old ones? Also, technologies typically peak just before being replaced, so it doesn't tell us either way. ""New projects"" would be factual, except that non-public ones are hard to measure, and there is a genuine fall-off in new public java projects.<p>For example, github lists a very small proportion of Java projects - 5% (of course, github historically favours ruby) <a href=""http://github.com/languages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/languages</a>; but Java is top on <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/search/?words=java&type_of_search=soft&words=&search=Search"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/search/?words=java&type_of_search...</a><p>[<i>EDIT</i> some language popularity trackers: <a href=""http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index....</a> <a href=""http://lang-index.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lang-index.sourceforge.net/</a> <a href=""http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/comp.lang-statistics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/comp.lang-statistics/</a>]<p>Trying to extrapolate: Some weak points of java (verbosity and static typing) actually can be benefits to large companies, who want things to be clear and stable. Once a language gets established, it's difficult to dislodge because of infrastructure (tools; libraries; standards; trained workforce etc).<p>One way dominant technologies can get replaced is to be disrupted, especially by a lower level. One disruption that is currently happening is ""cloud computing"", and there are initiatives within it, like Service Component Architecture, to try to minimize language dependence. Java suits this space quite well, so it's unlikely to be disrupted by it. Sun is gone, but its light lives on: the network is the computer.",1278121869

If a certain volume of oiled water is processed by a machine that has reduced filtering standards -- essentially, only removing the bigger or easier to capture materials suspended in the water -- it may make it harder for later cleanup operations to further address the remaining pollutants that were released back into the water. Either because they become much harder to detect (harder to see/smell/taste, or react to chemical sensors) or become harder to ""bind"" with cleaning agents. In other words, while at a logic-only level the EPA position may appear stupid, it's possible that from a chemical & logistical standpoint it may not be.<p>Regardless, I think it's reasonable to expect BP to be moving heaven & earth to clean this shit up as fast as they possibly can, since they made the mess in the first place.",1278119085

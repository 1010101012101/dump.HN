An application is certainly a tool, with features X, Y, and Z, but at the same time there are experiences that go along with the usage of those features. Miyamoto likens it to telling a joke or writing a mystery novel: timing is key. You mustn't overwhelm the user with too much information nor leave the user wondering where to go next.<p>Miyamoto's games are excellent examples of Donald Norman's affordability. In some of his newer games characters may give a long speech to the player via a modal dialog box, but the keywords are highlighted in certain colors to denote that they are either important people, places or actions; and after you have talked to character, walking past him may cause a small non-modal speech bubble to pop up with some small blurb summing up the info given by that character, e.g. ""Find the key to unlock my friend!"" so that you don't have to go through the longer speech again.<p>What really sets his games apart from many others is simply the attention to detail and the amount of polish. When once asked about the delay of a certain game he replied, ""A delayed game is eventually good, but a bad game will stay bad forever.""",1292244126

A few of my experiences/thoughs (my app is on a single VPS - test/staging and production servers are separate systems):<p>Patrick's suggestion to keep a log with all the setup steps for the production was already a life saver. Two days ago I remembered that my server was running 32bit code and I was going to run MongoDB on it. Whoops. Complete reinstall in 48min, worry-free.<p>I'm keen on git, and plan to use it to deploy to production. I actually rsync to test/staging server doing development[0] (to avoid having to commit knowingly broken code just to be able to deploy on testing/staging server), but I use git to manage the code, and to deploy it. I have a clone repo on the production server with a production branch, which has a few commits on top of master, in which I committed the production-specific configuration.<p>Deploying on production does roughly:
1. check out the latest code from master
2. rebase production on top of master in a temporary repo to catch any rebase problems (because I don't want to merge master into production)
3. run unit tests in a temporary repo (sadly my tests only test the backend, not the web ui; I plan to improve in 2011 :)
4. rebase real production repo
5. make a new tag (for almost-one-click rollbacks)
6. restart whatever services need to be restarted<p>This is automated by a simple shell script which aborts at the first sign of trouble.<p>Regarding the 3rd party packages versioning: I use system packages wherever available. I don't have automatic updates though, and I don't use a system having rolling updates (I'm on Ubuntu Maverick). I had to manually rebuild two packages: nginx (to include upload module) and Tornado web server (the one in Maverick is too old for my purposes). This was pretty straightforward, and I've recorded the exact steps in my server setup log.<p>[0] my app involves callbacks from external services, so I can't test it on my laptop; my development workflow is ""save in editor, rsync, see whether it works"", with services in debug mode reloading themselves as soon as change is detected.",1292242382

Everybody says it, but I'm still surprised at the number of devs who have next to no idea about index and how they work.<p>Few guides: Every index adds a write penalty, so don't just add them to everything. If you've got a compound index, it will only be used if the query also uses all the fields in the index (If you build an index on surname, firstname and dob, but execute select * from users where firstname=""Bob"" and surname=""Jones"", the index won't be used). Benchmark the difference each index makes, and stand back in awe at the improvement a few well places indexes can contribute.<p>[Edit: as pointed out below, my experience is well out of date and it looks like there's a number of database engines where the compound index thing doesn't apply]<p><i>Learn to think in sets</i>. Most devs are used to operating on discrete pieces of data; we're not used to thinking in sets, and so writing efficient SQL doesn't come naturally. Put in the effort and learn it and you'll be well rewarded. SQL is built around sets of data, and can almost assuredly do stuff faster than your code can. Hint: anytime you find yourself getting the result of a query, iterating over the result set and executing another query for each result <i>you're doing it wrong</i><p><i>Learn how your ORM works</i>. If you're using an ORM (and most of us do), learn how to use it efficiently. This is where having a good working knowledge of SQL helps, because you can then find out how to help your ORM create good SQL. If you're using ActiveRecord, understand how to correctly use :conditions, :include etc, and what they're doing behind the scenes. Ideally you want your ORM to make one call to the DB, and to retrieve everything you need in that one call (calls are expensive, even for very small queries).

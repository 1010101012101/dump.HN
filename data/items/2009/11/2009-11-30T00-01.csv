967151,comment,966986,967070,0,0,storborg,,,"Agreed. I think most universities would rather err on the side of CS, lest they be construed as something like a trade school. Unfortunately, that doesn't mesh well with the reality that the majority of students will go into software engineering, not computer science. It's clearly difficult to serve the divergent goals of teaching people core abstract concepts, while still adequately preparing them for a career.<p>In most of my ""CS"" classes, it was sort of assumed that tools like version control, test suites, etc were just part of getting things done, and they were up to you to learn on your own time. Lots of TAs/LAs had quick tutorials to teach things like CVS and the like, but it wasn't really considered course material. The same was true for processes/development models, and for tools in other areas of engineering, like Solidworks, SPICE, etc.",1259542628

It is a matter of how you define ""the base of the data"". My point is that there is a calculation on the measurement, and only the result of the calculation is recorded. Hence the base data is discarded.<p>We don't know what calculations were done on the climate date in question here. But it seems at least possible that the calculation is also trivial (for climate researchers anyway, could be some standard procedure), just as to us converting heights to degrees is trivial.<p>Recording the type of thermometer is another matter - likewise the climate researchers will probably record where their measurements were taken, which implies the equipment used.<p>Edit: of course if the calculations are reversible is another issue. I see now that is the point you made with the thermometer (calculate height from make and degrees). Well, it was just an example, and we don't even know yet if the calculations in question here are not reversible. I suppose if they calculated an average they are not. But I also think there are probably many cases where a measurement is just taking an average (probably even the height of quicksilver is an average in a way...).",1259542298

Strictly speaking, letting you destructively modify <i>local</i> variables in Erlang wouldn't have any impact on concurrency.<p>In Prolog, it's because there's only unification, not assignment. Semantically, it's as if ""X always had that value, it just wasn't known until now"" - you can pass around unbound values and retroactively bind them for all places of use, but you can't ever change them.

Definitely not a good feeling.<p>I think what I'm thinking is more a long the lines of ""actually"" giving away a non-free plan. So whatever your entry level paid plan is, just lower it a little more, and then be prepared to charge money for it, but anytime you want to do a marketing push, give it away for free. So its not going to be like some secretly free plan. The whole point is to give something of value away for free. I think all customers would appreciate that.<p>Lastly, I like how 37 signals has a lowly-advertised ass-basic free plan. It's still free, but they make it a point to really imply that ""it aint all that great"". I like this because it implicitly reminds every customer that deals with 37 signals that their product costs money for a reason.

Perhaps it has a name but the premise is just that you have to attach VALUE to whatever it is you are giving away. If you price something as ""FREE"" and then give it away, then the user does not feel like he's really getting anything. If you price something for $200.00, and then give it away, well they just got $200 for FREE - AWESOME!!<p>So my current plan of attack is have 3 pricing tiers that all costs money. Then as of now, I'm in ""beta"" so I have this huge ""sale"" ""this month only"" where all users get ""PLUS accounts FREE FOR LIFE!"". And clearly right there, Plus accounts normally cost $100/yr, so I'm reasoning that a customer would derive more value from signing up than if I had just called the Plus plan ""free"" with a fat ass zero for the price.<p>So in other words. Be a premium product so everyone understands you are worth something, and then have sales, and reasons to give those oh-so-valuable plans away.<p>HTH",1259539270

Honestly I think it's ridiculous that I would get down-voted for supporting an article that's now at number one. Clearly people care about the topic, and it's not like I contributed ""less"" to the discussion than the original comment I replied to, which was up-voted like wildfire. It's not like I'm on here spouting support for Ron Paul or linking to leftist blogs.",1199487492

Does it add value here? Can't YC-News specialize and focus where it has an advantage?",1199486693
94976,comment,94782,94821,0,0,timr,,,"I completely agree (ironically enough).  I <i>always</i> seem to be taking a critical view of ideas, but I'm also extra diligent to base my opinions in logic and fact.  Nevertheless, I can't shake the feeling that I'm just Mr. Negativity;  I don't feel particularly inspired when I'm critical, but I can't let go of the need for rational thought.<p>It's fairly well-established that creativity thrives in an environment of support and optimism -- is criticism truly poisonous for success, or are we all just fooled by survivor bias?<p>(for example: let's say that 99% of ideas are bad, but 99% of all ideas are generated by blind optimism.  Thus nearly all successful ideas are generated by blind optimists, but the survivors don't accurately reflect the success rate of optimistic thinking.  If this is true, it's easy to be critical, hard to be successful, and the enormous successes are so rare, that they don't accurately reflect much of anything, other than luck....)",1199486555

94970,comment,94840,94840,0,0,jimbokun,,,"I see a lot of complaints about ""platitudes"" here, but I think this glosses over the impact of the Obama campaign.<p>There is not really much disagreement about what the important issues are.  Get out of Iraq.  Stop using fossil fuels.  Get everyone affordable health insurance.  Inflation and stagnant wages.  There is a general consensus now that these are the U.S.'s big problems and we need pragmatic solutions to them.  (The other consensus is that the Republican party has collapsed and needs to be removed from power as soon as possible.)<p>What Obama is offering is a way out of the broken record of baby boomer liberal vs. conservative rhetoric.  If Hillary wins, we're in for 4 to 8 more years of the same old partisan story line that has played out since her husband was elected.  Many Americans are more than sick of that and that is what Obama is appealing to and that is why he won.<p>And I think his attitude is basically right.  More than specific policy proposals at this moment, Americans need a new mindset.",1199485840

That ought to be reserved for really dumb comments or abusive ones or off-topic ones.  Not that I give that much of a crap about my karma, it just makes me go, ""WTF was wrong with that?!""

94963,comment,94840,94893,0,0,jimbokun,,,"Uh, it wasn't directed at you.<p>If it was some kind of international forum with a delegate of Americans, granted, that would be pretty annoying.<p>The subtext here is that Republicans have obviously tried to claim that criticism of them is criticism of your country and therefore distasteful.  Some liberals, progressives, have responded by taking the bait and basically, saying ""Yeah, we do suck.  The world should hate us.  Etc.""<p>While you in the rest of the world may think that statement is exactly correct, for some reason it has not led to electoral success.<p>Obama has been clever enough to side step the whole thing.  He has been withering in his criticism of the current administration.  At the same time, he has made a theme of not running to be president of only the ""blue"" parts of this country.  And he has backed this up with speeches about issues that, while not changing his more or less standard Democratic positions, express respect for people who disagree with him.<p>So, the spontaneous ""U.S.A"" chants were directed at both the current administration and its supporters, and whatever parts of the opposition that have given up on this country.    It was a way of saying that we can get past partisanship and actually start thinking about doing what we need to do to fix our real problems as a country.<p>And, I did see your smiley.  But I thought an explanation of what this means to someone living in the U.S.A. (speaking only for myself, of course) might be useful.",1199484743

I registered www.jeremyraines.com and it just uses ruby's xml and rss parsing libraries to scrape certain pictures from my flickr account, certain kinds of posts from my tumblr, and it has my friendfeed widget on it.

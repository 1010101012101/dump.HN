But, I think at the high-school level, it would be more important to expose students to something with a low barrier of entry. I don't mean the language, but the entire package. With VB you install one application, and you get an environment where you basically type code and press a play button to get it to run.",1289292770

1885848,comment,1885594,1885594,0,0,gruseom,,,"It's a bad sign that most of these comments (about 20, as I'm typing this) are trying to talk this kid out of his enthusiasm for Python in defense of -- heaven help us -- VB.Net. Come on, people. If we can't do better than that on Hacker fricking News, perhaps the doomsayers are right after all and this neighborhood is done.<p>Hold on, newsisan, there are thousands of Python hackers here. Let's see if any cavalry ride to your rescue.<p>I'm not a Python guy so this will be weak, but I'll do my bit.<p>1. Community. Python is far more widespread in the web, open source, and scientific communities. It will be much easier to find interesting projects to play with and libraries to build on.<p>2. Simplicity. Contrary to what your teacher may have heard, Python is an excellent beginner language. VB.Net is actually way more complicated. It's Microsoft propaganda that positions VB.Net as the best language for beginners. (Edit: it seems nearly everyone here disagrees with this. Am I crazy? Let's hear from some Python people.)<p>3. Quality. Python is far more organized around clean programming constructs and practices than VB.Net, which is an arbitrary mess.<p>4. Openness. Python gives all the advantages of an open codebase and platform. I suppose I should list some, but I'm tired.<p>5. The REPL (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop</a>) is hands-down the best technique for playing with programming concepts, trying out ideas and getting feedback, learning, and coming up with the building blocks for programs. Once you've gotten comfortable with the REPL you'll never want to live without it again. No one should learn programming without this invaluable resource, which Python has and VB.Net does not.<p>5. Cool. VB.Net is the ultimate in uncool. Python holds its own just fine. Frivolous? Yeah, but there are deep reasons for these things. Learn Python so the other programmers won't smell VB on you and peck you to death.<p>Good luck!<p>p.s. A simple additional principle you should know: never try to talk a programmer out of their favorite language. It can't be done. If your teacher is deeply attached to VB.Net, just go with what he wants and enjoy the positive aspects of the class (if he's a great teacher, that's the most important thing anyway and you're lucky to have him). If he doesn't care that much, though, maybe you can wear him down with your enthusiasm. :)<p>pp.s. Worst case scenario, write all the programs in Python and then rewrite them in VB.Net to hand in. You'll have more fun and learn more.",1289292192

1885835,comment,1885594,1885594,0,0,codefisher,,,"There are quite a few things you need to learn to be able to program well.  One of the easy ones is syntax, which is what you have to learn to go from one language to another, in addition to the names of variables/functions.<p>What is much harder to learn, and is largely language independent is:\n1) Problem solving - the ability to break problems down into simple task that then can be trivially solved.\n2) Data structures - programs are unless unless they have data to work with.  Knowing how to best represent it is vital, do you use an array, linked list, tree etc.\n3) Algorithms - known ways of operating on data to produce some out come.  Everything from using a loop to add numbers, to sorting lists, or adding a node to a red-black tree.\n4) Design Patterns - know ways to structure code, in a tried and tested fashion.\n5) Architecture and Interface design - how to structure your project as a whole (what goes where) and how to set how one portion interacts with all the others.<p>Along with many other things.  Point being the first language you learn matters little, if you learn to program that cross any language barrier.  I have not touched the first language I learned for almost a year, but have learned 2 others in that time.<p>Having said all that, I am most at home in Python because there I know many of the language specific features.",1289291679

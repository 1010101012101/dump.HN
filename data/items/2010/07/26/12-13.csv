While you are right that this is not using it as a <i>real database</i>, I want to know if PostgreSQL is deployed in a similar setup at all. Most of the people (including you) don't take into account the fact that there are many cases where MySQL (used as a KV store) proved to work, while I have never heard of such huge PostgreSQL deployments. If this was a general discussion regarding MySQL and PostgreSQL I could understand that, however, I think the post is more about whether to choose MySQL or PostgreSQL if you are going to use it as a KV store.",1280149135

1547855,comment,1547554,1547716,0,0,mbateman,,,"To defend the film critic regurgitation a bit, I don't think characters have to have emotional depth or development, but it's typically a good thing when you care about them and their problems.<p>As for the exposition point, I think something can be said in defense of the story in the link.<p><i>(Spoilers follow.)</i><p>Re: emotional attachment. One of the things that annoyed me about Inception was that the big reveal of what happened to Marion Cotillard is totally internal to the weird mechanics of the world. She got driven crazy because she had to be manipulated into giving up the dream world. Erm, okay. To me the main plot with Cillian Murphy had a more interesting core: a guy's self-understanding in relation to his inheritance and successful father. Both are shallow and not ""deep"", both ""develop"" in the movie, but the second has some meaning to me and the first doesn't, and it seems to me to be a real advantage.<p>Re: exposition. I agree that one can get overly concerned with this. But I think it's annoying when exposition goes on during the entire movie, so that rules are introduced in order to explain something going on right that second. For example, all of a sudden it matters whether or not you die in the dream world, and it has to be explained why. Or the elaborate and (to me) cool idea of worming one's way through someone's subconscious by constructing labyrinths and stuff is suddenly thrown out in favor of action sequences involving a ""militarized"" subconscious. It makes the movie feel more ad hoc and random.<p>If the movie is going to just be about the mechanics of a world with weird rules, then fine. It's not favorite cup of tea, but I can definitely appreciate it. But there are better and worse constructions and presentations of artificial mechanics, and more and less involving plot vehicles for exploring it. Though some of Kirk Hamilton's particular complaints strike me as silly, I overall agree with him that Inception was inferior to the Matrix in this regard. If anything I think the right analogy with Inception is the second Matrix movie.",1280148801

So, the notion of justice is very much fundamental to law. Even in criminal law, what is just is the basis upon which any authority can legitimately imposed. It is for example not just to punish someone who was provoked to kill at the same rate as someone who intended, with full and clear mind, to kill.<p>Also, even assuming that individuals do not have any free will at all, a murderer still should be punished, regardless of any notion of moral responsibility. This for example we do with the insane who it can not be said are morally responsible, yet are locked away so as to not harm others.<p>Thus, in a fundamental way, it is not so much as to what is evil that the law is guided by primarley, but practical matters, what is desirable, fair and very much just.",1280148770

1547842,comment,1547652,1547652,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I my early 20s, after getting out of the service, I worked as an assistant manager at a fast-foot restaurant in the evenings while I did college during the day. It was a full load of credits, and the food place I was working was very busy too, so it made for a long, hard slog.<p>One day I was talking to another of the assistant managers. I asked him about burn-out. Do you ever feel like you might be burning out?<p>""Not me. Can't happen""<p>""Why""<p>""Because I got burnt-out a year or two ago. I just pushed through it.""<p>He was smiling. Sort of in a fatalistic way.<p>I'm not denying burn-out: I get it all the time. But I do think we over-emphasize it. As Jacques points out, if you live a life of leisure you have little danger of burning out. You also have little danger of living a life of challenging yourself to do new and complex things.<p>I think, as my friend pointed out so many years ago, that the problem is viewing burn-out as an yes-or-no situation. In fact, there are degrees of burn-out, and you can drift into burn-out land and drift back. What people really need to do, in my opinion, is learn their own rhythms. Personally, I like working hard for a few months then skating for a month or two. I find I get more done. I find when I am working hard, taking a ten minute break every hour helps. Sometimes I take all day on Saturday and watch movies. Or go for a hike.<p>So the trick isn't avoiding burn-out. The trick is learning your own rhythms so you maximize your productivity while you're stuck on this rock. Burnt-out? Back off, sure. But note your rhythm, and next time you won't burn out as much.<p>Life is a marathon, not a sprint. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't get your kick on.<p>EDIT: That didn't come out exactly as I wanted. It sounded as if I were just telling folks to buck up. But that's not what I meant to say. The point was self-reflection.<p>This gets back to learning yourself -- your rhythms and values. I find that if I immerse myself in something I am deeply committed to, burning out is a learning experience. But I immerse myself in something I hate -- working for some other guy, doing something because I am forced to? Burning out can really hurt and require lots of time to recover from.<p>That's why I don't do that.<p>Burning out early and for a long time -- indication that you are putting a lot of effort in something you resent.",1280148502

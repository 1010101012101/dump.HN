488703,story,,,6,2,leftnode,"Ask HN: Hackers House in Dallas, TX?",,"I'm in the process of starting my own company and will be leasing some office space soon. The office space is way too much than I need, so I wanted to create a Hacker's House in Dallas, TX.<p>Let me explain my idea of a Hacker's House: I essentially want a place where high school/college kids can hang out in a technological environment that can provide things they otherwise may not have access to. This would include desktop/servers, computer science library, other developers to shoot ideas off of, etc. Basically, a geek heaven. It's kind of like a Users Group, but can discuss anything technological/just hang out with other geeks. Come and go as they please, etc.<p>Is this something developers would enjoy? I know when I was in high school and college, I'd love to have a place where I could go hang out with other developers other than school. It would be a place for kids to do CS research, develop their own ideas, work on their own startups, etc. I wouldn't ask for anything in exchange, if someone develops the next million dollar idea while hanging out there, best for them.<p>Initially, I would provide as many computers as I could afford (probably 5 or so) and a server. I would look for angel investors to invest in other aspects (I've estimated I'll need about $12,000 to start and my business would continue to pay for the continuation of the Hacker's House).<p>Any feedback is appreciated it. You're more than welcome to contact me at vmc@leftnode.com if you have other questions/ideas.<p>Thanks!",1235140896

This quote, plus the fact that the plan for ""moving forward"" was to pull in another framework wholesale, does not bode well for the Rails community. It by no means indicates that the Rails community is doomed, but it does not bode well.<p>I'd also like to take this moment to point out that this is yet another indication that the Ruby community != the Rails community. Quite to the contrary, I think you'll find the Ruby community quite flexible and robust when faced with opposition.

488670,comment,488510,488510,0,0,gjm11,,,"The trouble with ""race"" is that it's pretty meaningless biologically; human ""races"" are a long way from being (e.g.) biological subspecies. What race boundaries <i>do</i> correlate well with is sharp <i>social</i> differences, and therefore with things like wealth and education and social status. So, if IQ tests measure some combination of (1) innate cognitive differences, (2) acquired cognitive differences (quite possibly strongly affected by those socially-governed factors), and (3) purely social things like familiarity with ideas assumed in the test, then looking for connections with ""race"" is going to exaggerate #3 and #2 in comparison to #1.<p>On the other hand, any reported result about relationships (or absence of relationships) between ""race"" and IQ is inevitably going to be interpreted in terms of #1.<p>So I'm all for scientists studying genetic correlates of intelligence, but anything that's described as a study of ""race and IQ"" seems likely to generate more heat than light.<p>And that's even without getting into the fact that racism (on the one hand) and ""political correctness"" (on the other) seem likely to introduce bias into the research, how it's written up, whether it gets published, and how the published results get reported to the general public.

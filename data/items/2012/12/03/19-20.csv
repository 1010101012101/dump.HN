The reviews don't hit you like an opinionated ton of bricks; the style of the Verge recognizes that there are nuances in reviewing any product that are ultimately subjective. I don't want to read ""buy the iPhone 4S and nothing else"", I want to read what the reviewer thought the pros and cons are, regardless of how much he weights those pros and cons. Because I'll probably think some things are more important than he does.<p>The Sphero got a pretty harsh review, including the summary wrap-up of 'THERE ARE PLENTY OF BETTER WAYS TO SPEND $129.99' and a 5.0/10, which as anyone who reads reviews on any site knows is below average. I honestly don't see the problem, it's not The Verge is hiding its opinion that they wouldn't buy the product.",1354564765

Your credibility would be destroyed because YC would be seen as a primary finder of companies.that.have no long term.value. . YC needs a liquid market of shitty start ups to get vc funding in order to function. I'm sure you are aware that even the tinyest hint of.trouble.can pop bubbles, which is.why you purged this.article.<p>I laughed at your decision to kill the article for a couple of reasons. first, this means that you are aware of the bubble and also aware that in order to prevent new companies from being discouraged from applying to YC you need a zero tolerance policy on even the hint of it showing its ugly head. by banning this article you have confirmed to me that there is a bubble and it is about ready to pop. second, this says a lot about your character and your priorities as a person. you are ok with draconian anti free flow of information banning if an idea goes against your personal interests. for.someone who funds tech start ups, you seem.to.have forgotten.how.the internet works. the Truth will get out. supposedly the voting system.of.hackernews should have prevented a false idea from.getting.to.the front page. if this idea was truly as false as you say it is in your reasons to ban it, it never would have been upvoted. and yet you had to ban it. third, this means that you truly don't give a shit about the.companies or the people that you fund. you know that it the.bubble.is.close.to.popping and.that.it may not be in their best long term interests to apply to YC, but you want their talent anyways so you can profit, so you continue.to cultivate the idea that their stupid business idea is not a problem as.long.as.they pivot.enough.times to.find a similiar, slightly less stupid idea to try to sell to Google or.whoever.<p>I've been thinking about it for a while, but your response to this.article has confirmed.to.me that I will.never apply to YC. You are not a person who I would want to take advice.from, let alone have any say over.my.life. or how I run my business. I wish you luck, though, and I hope.you can continue to find enough chumps.to.apply to.YC so you can continue.to.fund hackernews.and I can read interesting articles.for.free... so thanks.for.that, anyways.<p>edit: I know you (pg) won't respond, and I know you will probably shadow ban my account, and I know this comment will be downvoted into oblivion.

4867449,comment,4865826,4867144,2,0,Tipzntrix,,,"Gas mileage and average life of transmission, etc. are benchmarks that do matter to the average consumer.  The max horsepower isn't used at all by people purchasing cars for travel on the main roads, but max processor power is probably used at least from time to time on people purchasing computers, maybe because of running badly-written software or just trying to open a million tabs in Chrome.<p>Build quality/durability is quite a tough pickle to nail statstics on.  Used Apple sales may still carry a higher price tag because people paid more for them in the first place, or because of the brand name.  % of devices still running to their consumer's satisfaction is a statistic I haven't seen before, and might be skewed by the type of respondents.  Some of the tests done here that I put stock into are actually some of the most interesting: like dropping Nintendo cartridges from 3 story buildings, or leaving a laptop in your freezer or out on the hot pavement for an hour to see what happens when you try to use them again. There are a lot of stories here about what kind of abuse their laptops take, but I would go on over to Youtube and actually look at some people who went out of their way to record this.  Word of mouth and anecdotes really do dominate this area, so I can't say much about this outside of personal experience, which really comes down to ""Wait at least a year, do at least an hour's research, and hope you're lucky"".  Even within a brand, some products are very durable while others are flimsy.<p>ASUS falls off that list when it comes to vendor support, but Sony, Dell and Lenovo all offer support, though I have never come across useful vendor support, so I'll have to keep quiet about that.  Generally I try to buy equipment that is durable enough not to fail within that warranty period, and after that I'll move on.",1354564563

If this was a PHPBB, you'd want this to be one of the ""sticky"" threads.<p>Key questions (some overlap) from my experience:<p>* Are we the founders allowed to work with or advise any other startups or projects before XXX milestone in the company?<p>* What is the decision mechanism we will use to resolve intractable disputes, and why do we believe it will work?<p>* What is the mechanism by which a founder will be released from the team, and how will we engage it?<p>* How are we vesting?<p>* Can we make a list of every acquaintance we could ever possibly foresee hiring? How will we <i>voir dire</i> those people, so we aren't fighting over whose friends we're willing to hire?<p>* How many months of salary per employee will we need to add a headcount?<p>* At what point will we pull the trigger and start pitching our offering to customers? Are we waiting for a rev1 or beta release? Can we start selling now?<p>* Who apart from the dev lead will decide when it's time to ""ship"" or ""sell""?<p>* How will we decide to ""pivot"" or give up on our original offering?<p>* If our idea fails, are we continuing as this team, or reevaluating? If we're not sure, how will we decide? How do we know we're giving each other honest answers?<p>* As we willing to add part-timers, juniors, or indefinite interns, and if so, how will we account for them?<p>* What level of agreement among the founders is required to fire an employee?<p>* Under what circumstances would we consider adding an employee to our ""management team"" or ""cofounder pool""?<p>* Once we have a management team, will we continue managing it and the rest of the company as a group of cofounders, or will that conversation be vested in the management team?<p>* What resources will we spend on promotion and appearance marketing? Do we require a high-end website? Do we require a professional logo? Do we require business cards?

Glass connections in a datacenter are $.10 per megabit, but AT&T DSL over copper to your house is $30 for 1.5 megabits. That copper could become glass, but no one will pay for that upgrade.<p>The distribution problem is that in order to compete with at&t at the residential level, you have to build a parallel connection and the cost of doing so is prohibitively large. Therefore, everyone is forced to rent access from AT&T, BUT since common carriage doesn't apply to residential access lines, AT&T doesn't have to share.<p>If sonic.net could build glass to your house, they would, and they wouldn't ever complain of congestion, but because of artificial barriers to entry no new competitors can enter the market.<p>Does that make sense? I'm not trying to be evasive, it's just a complicated problem. Carriers don't have a problem dealing with aggregate capacity, they have a problem dealing with edge access capacity.

While encouraging students to discuss problems, he informed them that plagiarizing assignments was not allowed.  When he got the first assignment, he noticed that the solution handed in by one of the top students in the department was identical to the one handed in by a much weaker student.  So, he gave zero to the top student and full marks to the weaker student. (It should be noted that the contribution of each assignment towards the final grade was likely less than 2%). As he expected, the student who got zero went to see him.  My colleague told him that he had no foolproof way to show that it was the other student that plagiarized the assignment and that the best method to prevent another zero being given was to not allow other students to plagiarize his assignment - if indeed this is what had happened.  This solved the problem for that year ... and for many years after as word got around.<p>So...

What I mean to say is that basically if you're making a production level app, you just build it to work cross-browser that's the way it is, you rarely do things based on UA if you know what you're doing and opt for feature testing instead. Maybe some provide neat little extras if a browser has a specific feature like webgl, but you're going to make sure all functionality is provided for every browser so you hit the widest audience.<p>I find it hard to believe you get clients that think everyone uses Chrome, that's never happened to me. I've also rarely had a client ask for something to only work in a specific browser, the few exceptions have been making things work for IE6 or older browsers that were used internally by larger corps.<p>These are just my thoughts, discussion is welcomed :)",1354564251

Sure, we should seek to minimise the impact of crappy tasks, but the best way to motivate people to ""do things they don't want to do"" is to turn the lousy things into things that they do want to do.<p>That starts with treating people like adults, and explaining the underlying reasons for the tasks. It also means listening to the people who will be doing the work, having genuine empathy with their situation and changing or reallocating the tasks accordingly. It also means giving autonomy and control to the people doing the tasks to allow them to perform the tasks under their own terms.<p>If it is not meaningful work, then perhaps it should not be done at all. Indeed your job as a manager is primarily to provide aircover to team members, as getting rid of overhead tasks will allow the team time and energy to focus on the main job.<p>For those tasks that are not removable, the manager needs to create sense out of it all, explaining why the pain has to occur and how they are helping to mitigate the pain.

And I'd like to hear your opinion about it.<p>What problem am I speaking of? \nThe soon to become over-talked issue of web apps developed to work correctly only on one browser(Usually Chrome) without even a reliable fallback to other browsers. I've seen many flavors of this issue in the wild, ranging from the ""Proof of concept"" sites that make clear their content only works or shows on X Browser, to sites changing landing pages depending on the User-Agent browser where only the chosen browser will have all functionality and the others will simply avoid being ""too ugly"", and to the extreme case of websites not rendering at all if you do not use whatever browser you are told to.<p>This is not a new problem, I believe anyone who has developed for some time with MicroStrategy, Appian, SAP or any other JAVA based ERP, BI or BMP, has also encountered this quickly annoying issue of being FORCED to work with Internet Explorer.<p>However, I do believe there is another side to the coin. A side where, for example, developers that only work for Chrome are able to push the bounds of the available tools and create really neat new web apps.<p>What I'd like to know is not only your point of view of how good or how bad this issue is. But if you have any ideas on if and how it could be fixed.<p>Personally, I'm so tired of meeting with clients asking ""Why can't we do it if everyone uses (EG) Chrome"" or being too afraid to hire new developers because themselves or someone near them has a spooky story involving one of this developers.",1354563457

I have a Cinema Display which does the exact same thing, and I've basically become immune to really noticing it much anymore. When I first became aware of it I tried just about everything to resolve the 'problem'. I was able to find a way to clear ghosting almost completely, and it's as simple as running a particular screensaver for the extended periods of time you're not using your system. The name of it is ""LCD Scrub"", and although I was skeptical it really does work.

This is not just a shameless plug for the app I just posted to HN (pvshapp.com), though I know it seems that way. I really think you've demonstrated perfectly why there needs to be a standardized platform for consumer product requests--as unlikely as improvements seem.<p>What you've just done with this post is build 334 affirmations of a change that Apple needs to hear and make. Perhaps it's deeper, more pervasive than a single feature request, but it still highlights a dimension of the company Apple needs to pay attention to. It may seem futile, and it may seem like hundreds of these requests have been made directly through Apple's customer support website, but the fact is that it's not powerful persuasion unless you have public support. That's why PvshApp has 2 objectives: 1) Make it as easy as a Tweet to create a request, and 2) add a public audience to actualize support if there is any.<p>For Apple, the value of this input is that they can condense customer feedback into one single request that they can focus on (if they so desire) OR here's a dumb idea: If Apple doesn't want to implement the feature, then who's stopping a third party producer from adding the feature? Seriously, it may seem like an IP nightmare at first, and I'm certainly no expert, but if a 3rd-party producer actually wanted to purchase the Apple products at full price, then augment them and sell the added features for a premium, who's to stop them? (This is a question, I'd love to know the answer!) Maybe Apple casts too large of a legal shadow, but I'm sure there are all sorts of other products for which users would be willing to pay a premium for augmented features.",1354562516

One was bringing the desktop up to five years, and that was in response to enterprise demand.<p>And the second change we made was to make a stronger commitment around making those LTS versions available on new hardware as it comes out, so that people can get hardware refreshes and still maintain a stable software platform across the enterprise.<p>So we'll make the 12.10 kernel work with 12.04 and the 13.04 kernel work with 12.04. So if you need that kernel for hardware support, it will be available.<p>LXF: Red Hat recently announced it was increasing its server support cycle from, I think it was, seven years to 10 years; does Ubuntu feel any pressure to match that?<p>JS: We're not seeing that right now. I think the reason is the different use cases in terms of people who use Red Hat and people who use Ubuntu. And, interestingly, we're seeing pressure almost in the opposite direction.<p>One of the things that's happening in the server world is that everything cloud-related is so fast moving, it's not realistic to think you're going to do something now and want the same tools and software in 10 years. What we see is people wanting the stability of the base OS, but wanting new hardware support for one, and newer software for cloud-related activities.<p>So, they want the new OpenStack, for example, on a 12.04 LTS base, so that's another thing we've committed to do with 12.04. In six months' time, you'll be able to get the newest OpenStack. 12.04 shipped with OpenStack Essex; but when Folsom comes out, the next version, people are going to want that not just on Ubuntu 12.10, but also on 12.04, which is for stable production.""",1354562463

If I run fiber out to each of my customers that can run at gigabit speeds, how should I regulate/charge each user?<p>1. I could artificially rate limit them to less than the physical link speed.

Further, any attempts at fixing it are obviously flawed because the government monolith is by definition unfixable.<p>Further, the cognitive dissonance in this viewpoint is strong, in that they can see how treating any other composite entity, e.g. corporations, or a single corporation, or whatever as a monolith will be ridiculed as ""you can't judge this composite entity as a whole based on a subset of it's components"". Similarly when the effects of the entities they like look like the results the fear from the government, it is all OK, because some magical thinking results in not understanding what a choice really is (namely that somehow being forced to do something because it is the only choice that minimizes harm when the mechanism is not government is freedom, but when it is government it is tyranny).",1354561863

Limo drivers have been driving legally, under as much or more regulation than taxi drivers for years. *<p>Not all Uber drivers are licensed limo drivers or hold taxicab medallions.  Moreover, there is a substantial difference between limosuine and taxicab services: by definition, limosuines are reserved in advance (and are thus not subject to fee caps), while taxicabs are hired on the spot (so the fees they may charge are stricly regulated to protect consumers).<p><i>Why is national regulation being pushed now, to require (among other things) towncars to be booked at least 30 minutes in advance? It certainly smacks of ""big bad entrenched regulators"" trying to fuck over a sprightly new startup.</i><p>It's not. You need to learn the difference between a national regulation and a bunch of major cities and metropolitan areas coming together to decide on a set of common rules that they will all agree to adopt.  Here's a hint: a national regulation applies <i>everywhere</i>.  A voluntary set of common rules applies only to those jurisdictions which agree to adopt the common rules.  This is a good thing; it means that future market entrants will have an easier time figuring out the rules.<p><i>Maybe you can explain how advanced booking regulations for an already regulated industry that didn't need them ever before helps benefit the public good.</i><p>Booking regulations already exist in every major taxicab market. These regulations predate WWII.<p><i>Most of these drivers don't own their own vehicles, they work for someone else, and are just trying to make a living. Requiring those hard-working drivers to have people schedule 30+ minutes in advance is taking money out of their pockets. </i><p>If these drivers are working for someone else and using that company's cars, then they are generally required to book all trips through that company's systems.  If they aren't, they are basically stiffing the company providing their car out of a portion of some of their fees.  If that's true, then Uber could be liable for tortious interference with contracts (between the drivers and their cab companies), which is also crime in some states.<p><i>I can't see how any of the proposed regulation benefits the public, and I certainly can't see how it offsets the benefits of what Uber brings.</i><p>No, but plenty of other people can.  Regulations exist to protect the <i>common</i> good, not to maximize the benefit of specific individuals (though in the course of protecting the common good many regulations will increase benefits to participants in affected markets).",1354561582

You may be wrong"".<p>Given <i>most</i> ideas are horrible, and most startups fail, the onus is on the guy telling you how ""rottenfood.com: Rotten food shipped same-day to your door!"" will be the next big thing to provide evidence his idea is not horrible.\nUsually this ""evidence"" is in the form of talking points: ""Rotten Food is a 500 million dollar industry just ripe for disruption"".\nThen when it fails ""the idea was good, but the time wasn't right, but it was a valuable learning experience"".<p>No! The idea was not good. It was horrible. The fact that you think otherwise tells me it was <i>not</i> a valuable learning experience, because you didn't learn the most important thing.<p>I can't even write up this comment without it turning into all snark, so i'm just going to leave it to the tech journalists :)",1354561366

Inflation creates an initial perspective of prosperity and causes an increase and shift in investment from capital goods to consumer goods. This leads to a self reinforcing bubble which eventually drains the economy and leads to a bust.<p>Trotsky is effectively saying that the bubble was due to interest rates and Dan Lyons is wrong to attribute it primarily to a character flaw of the persons involved.

Not calling any names, but a glorified mailing list or a shopping cart is not original technology, not in 2012. Facebook seems to do interesting stuff with social graph, but I can't help the feeling whatever value they have there goes to relatively tiny set of paying customers (advertisers) rather than to end-users.",1354561236

I'll tell you from 15 years in startups, including long stints in companies I didn't run that weren't even part of my identity with customer prospects I didn't even care about: rejection always stings, will probably always sting, and you will subconsciously (to your great detriment) always avoid situations with potential reject even though you know you need to not do that.<p>The result is a system that converges on stories that can pick up 6-18 months of funding runway without ever demonstrating value from real customers.<p>There are businesses that need to boot up without asking for money from customers, but they're not common, and when you find one, it will be very clear why you'd defer revenue, and the answer won't have anything to do with monetizing eyeballs.",1354561214

Some thoughts:<p>If you want to make important changes that could affect a startup's interest in accepting YC (financial terms) or make it much harder to get in (even at the interview stage) than it has been in the past you have a duty to do so before you hook hundreds of entrepreneurs into committing to sit with you for 10 minutes.<p>It was a good experience to prepare for and attend YC's interviews. However, it took valuable time away from the most important people in our company, both from a preparation standpoint and a distraction from execution.<p>Our company is based on the west coast, and the $800 in travel reimbursement did not cover our costs to attend (we went ~$200 over and were very lean. You upped the criteria, lowered the reward and didn't completely cover the cost to try out. Small dollars and a few days matter a lot to a company at our stage.<p>It is one thing to tweak your program and make it harder to get in. It is another to do so in secret or after you've gotten entrepreneurs' hopes, dollars and time committed to trying.<p>I hung out at the YC office before and after our interview, and the environment is not like you project: <a href=""http://static.picwing.com/18075/e_106219_t540.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.picwing.com/18075/e_106219_t540.jpg</a> It is actually pretty ruthless, and I picked up a sense of realized power and eliteness.<p>As an example, YC put a really nice selection of organic-looking food right next to entrepreneur registration table. This food was not for the entrepreneurs, yet it was on full display. I approached this food by accident and was actually told by a YC staff member (in a tone that suggested a silly mistake) that there were ""bits and scraps"" available on the other table for us.<p>That is kind of what it felt like in this process. A bounty of food that is kept within sight, but actually quietly kept quite far out of reach. It ended up feeling not that much different from pitching a traditional VC.",1354561211

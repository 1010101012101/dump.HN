What I mean is: you can argue that Gimp is not as good as PhotoShop, LibreOffice not as good as Office, or that Linux is not as good as Windows (which is clearly debatable) but they are good enough and they are all infinitely cheaper (literally) than their paying alternative. So that should be default choice for 99% of people. But it isn&#x27;t.<p>So my point is: The same goes for cars vs. bikes. Most people wouldn&#x27;t mind using a bike to go to work, but it feels weird to pay only a couple of bucks for a bike, when you&#x27;ve learn that the price to go to work is the price for a car.",1382734741

My argument was that research in the humanities is essentially done for the sake of doing research: to learn more about the world and the people in it. It is hard to see definite, monetary benefits, which is one of the reason arts/music/creative writing programs are being slashed cut in favor of match/science in primary education in the US.<p>The benefit of studying the humanities is one of personal edification. Students who study art or music in school are likely to be more disciplined and score better on standardized tests than their non-musician/artist colleagues. Not to mention, young students who have a strong background in the humanities are often happier with their quality of life (I know that music was the highlight of my day/week when I was in school).<p>A patronage program would be great for this type of degree...if any VCs out there want a personal music theorist I&#x27;d be happy to apply! My argument is that it is traditionally universities which have been the patrons of these degrees. This goes back at least to the earliest universities in Europe, where students learned the seven liberal arts: grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. The idea of the university was not to churn out good economic workers (as it tends to be today) but to produce well-rounded human beings. We in the humanities still think this is a worthy goal (and consequently, tend to make much less than our STEM counterparts).",1382734327

If their misanthropy affects their job choose people who are less misanthropic. If the institutions aren&#x27;t getting enough A-level talent for research and instruction to choose from, then they should look at how they are attracting talent.

And I need some calming today, because I spent a lot of what was meant to be my &quot;free&quot; time yesterday evening in a rollicking dispute on my Wikipedia user talk page about one tiny edit I did the day before. Indeed, the experience of being a Wikipedia editor is usually not even fun, not to mention not rewarding.<p>The submitted article notes that &quot;in July 2012, some editors started a page called WikiProject Editor Retention with the idea of creating a place to brainstorm ideas about helping newcomers and fostering a friendlier atmosphere. Today the most vibrant parts of that projects discussion page have gripes about &#x27;bullying done by administrators,&#x27; debates over whether &#x27;Wikipedia has become a bloody madhouse,&#x27; and disputes featuring accusations such as &#x27;You registered an account today just to have a go at me?&#x27;&quot; Yep, I visited that WikiProject Editor Retention a while ago to see if I could pick up some tips there on how to encourage conscientious editors to stay involved in Wikipedia, but all I found was that kind of dispute and back-biting.<p>It happens that my main area of professional research is connected to topics that are among the ten most edit-warred topics on Wikipedia.[1] So from the beginning of my involvement on Wikipedia in 2010, I&#x27;ve seen lots of reverts and lots of article talk pages that go on and on and on and on to waste time about petty disputes. Because I used to a professional periodical editor, and later an academic journal editorial assistant when pursuing my postgraduate degree, I have a sense of what a collaborative editing looks like, and I try to suggest to Wikipedians[2] how we can all collaboratively built an even better free, online encyclopedia.<p>It&#x27;s slow and pains-taking work to edit articles on controversial topics. I have found it helpful to compile source lists,[3] because Wikipedia always needs new sources, and then post links to the appropriate source lists to the talk pages of articles. Sometimes I see sources taken up by other editors months after I post such a link, gradually improving the quality of some articles. And of course I continually add new sources to my source lists whenever I learn about them from seeing them used in Wikipedia. I go to my alma mater&#x27;s academic library frequently to circulate reference books about the topics I research (mostly for work, but also for Wikipedia), and I devote a lot of time to verifying sources. About two hours of &quot;free&quot; time today were devoted to transcription typing of quotations from reference books into Wikipedia-format citations, which I hope to use in the next few months to update articles.<p>To answer some questions that came up in comments posted before this comment, Wikipedia does have a too-radical culture of not taking experts seriously, but indeed that is partly because it is hard to verify who is an expert. Wikipedia got badly burned once by a young guy who claimed to be an older guy with academic credentials and actual expertise on certain topics, and that phony not only pushed around a lot of other editors while editing articles, but even got a job at the Wikimedia Foundation without his background being checked out beforehand.[4] So now Wikipedia is once burned, twice shy about anyone who claims to be an expert. Come with sources, and everyone will join in the scrum of deciding whether or not you are an expert.<p>One person in this discussion thread claims to be an expert (and I believe him) and he wonders how much of a detailed reference he has to give for a widely known fact. There are a BUNCH of the 4,359,600 articles now on English Wikipedia that cite no sources, or at best only cite the name of a book or article without any page reference. So if you are really sure that a standard reference book in your field backs up a fact you&#x27;ve just inserted in the article, you can add a reference like <ref>Smith Handbook of Physics</ref> and let other editors sort out what edition of the handbook, and what page of the handbook, backs you up. I see that iterative process of improving references happen all the time, sometimes over years.<p>We have frequent discussions of the defects of Wikipedia here on Hacker News. I still wonder if there is space for a new effort to build a nonprofit, free, online encyclopedia for the whole world. Is the current Wikipedia just the AltaVista that will be replaced by a yet unknown Google? I think a more healthy and professional editing environment could still let another effort to build an online encyclopedia take off and surpass Wikipedia, if only it had enough seed funding.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23354613"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23354613</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/Editing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/Editing</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji#Source_Lists_to_Share_with_Other_Wikipedians"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji#Source_L...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/05/technology/05wikipedia.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/05/technology/05wikipedia.htm...</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essjay_controversy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essjay_controversy</a>",1382733438

Chernobyl is historically regarded as a propaganda clusterfuck and a major economic, civic, and political failure of modern history.<p>--[Full Response]--\nI could argue a number of this guys points, but the specific claim that the USSR excelled at taking responsibility and implementing an institutional clean up/response from day 0, is the polar opposite of all existing historical and scientific fact.<p>The historical fact here is that the USSRs response to Chernobyl was horribly botched, heavily manipulated by propaganda, and that the public was extremely uninformed of the context, causes, and consequences (both immediate and future), of the disaster.<p>The response was swift, yes, but dangerous, uninformed, and unorganized. Even the military/emergency crews and government employees/engineers first sent in to respond to the disaster, were lied to about the specifics and risks of the incident.  For civilians in the USSR, there was a total information black out for the first 2 days. Most citizens gleaned only limited facts/information, days and weeks later, largely via rumor or from international media.  Effective institutional response (from inside the USSR) and more accurate reporting only arrived after much international pressure and media attention.

6614263,comment,6611289,6614077,3,0,mjn,,,"> One needs only to look at how expensive small liberal arts colleges are. If their teachers spent more time in the classroom and less doing arcane research, the costs would come down.<p>But small liberal arts colleges are the places that already <i>do</i> primarily prioritize teaching, and expect professors to do relatively little research. Professors typically teach more courses per semester than at research universities, and are hired and promoted primarily based on teaching ability rather than research portfolio. This was the case at the Claremont Colleges, at least, where I went for undergrad; most professors just did a little research on the side, maybe one paper a year, and spent nearly full-time teaching. They&#x27;re expensive mainly because they have very small class sizes (big emphasis on small discussion seminars), and typically much smaller endowments and fewer donations than the famous research universities do. Plus, since none of the salaries or lab facilities are paid for by research-grant money, those have to come out of tuition, too. And, since there are no grad students, professors typically do most of the teaching work themselves, rather than offloading a significant proportion to a TA, as is done at research universities: sections, tutorials, grading, office hours, etc. are all the professor&#x27;s responsibility.<p>Big research universities, like MIT or Stanford or University of Texas or UCLA, are the ones that primarily emphasize research track record.",1382732207

It&#x27;s not sufficient to just say that you know it&#x27;s true, though, for good reason; a lot of &quot;common knowledge&quot;, even among scientists, is incorrectly or imprecisely remembered. Typically we are most reliable in our specific sub-specialty, where we actually will have no trouble coming up with sources off the top of our heads (in my very specific sub-sub-specialty, I could rattle off sources for almost anything without even needing to look them up). Outside our sub-specialty, we may remember some things but not 100% reliably, and often based on obsolete or incomplete knowledge (e.g. a course from university years ago) that someone familiar with the literature would be able to do a better job of covering. Hence the importance of referring directly to sources, not only to cite them, but to make sure the information is actually in those sources precisely as remembered. To me, &quot;I know X is true, but I don&#x27;t know where you can verify that&quot; is a bit of a red flag, typical of e.g. something someone vaguely remembers from med-school or undergrad, rather than something they <i>really</i> have a solid handle on.<p>In any case, as an academic myself, I find it weird that <i>we</i>, of all people, would find ourselves &quot;too busy to reference&quot; or something. That&#x27;s an attitude one finds among students asked to write papers, but academics do not have problems peppering supporting references all over the place; it&#x27;s basically second nature.

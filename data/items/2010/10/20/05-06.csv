Then make a sale or 0.99 a few weeks before the new launch to create some media exposure and leave the game at 1.99 again close to the release of the new product and leave it there until it dies or new signups become so low that 0.99 becomes the new price for the old game (while focusing on the new iterations off course).",1287554186

Granted, the vast majority of people out there aren't like that, but it's kind of odd on a site called 'hacker news' to see people who seem oblivious to the hacker spirit, and what a group of motivated people can accomplish, given time.<p>The reason there are no (visible - I'm sure there are a few minor ones out there) forks of Android is because Google is doing a decent job, and mostly racing ahead of where forkers would be going on their own.",1287554046

When you're ""Doing It Right,"" sub-communities exist to support their members in joining the parent community.  If you're a Ruby programmer, you're much more likely to go to a conference if there's a Ruby panel!<p>In that example, the Ruby ""sub-community"" (panel) serves 3 functions:  It gives skeptical Rubyists a ""safe place"" to base their experience; it gives curious non-Rubyists an entry point to start learning; and it creates an organizational ""bucket"" for Ruby-related discussion, so it doesn't clog other panels (as much, maybe).<p>Of course, ""Ruby"" is a separation by technical necessity, whereas ""Queer"" is a cultural one.  I'd be remiss in claiming that the exact same forces were at work.  My main point is simply:<p>In a perfect world, sub-communities would not be necessary.

If you accept IQ testing at all they call people over 130 on the WAIS very superior because genius implies a social or intellectual impact many very superior individuals never achieve.  Very superior scores correlate highly with success in a career.  But other variables matter much more.

He spent decades following a large sample of “gifted” students, searching for evidence that his measurement of intelligence was linked to real world success. While the most accomplished men did have slightly higher scores, Terman also found that other traits, such as “perseverance,” were much more pertinent. Terman concluded that one of the most fundamental tasks of modern psychology was to figure out why intelligence is not a more important part of achievement: “Why this is so, and what circumstances affect the fruition of human talent, are questions of such transcendent importance that they should be investigated by every method that promises the slightest reduction of our present ignorance.""<p>Kurt Vonnegut Quote:<p>""Novelists . . . have, on the average, about the same IQ as the cosmetic consultants at Bloomingdale's department store.

Everything is organized as a set of 'fragments' which have a variety shapes; its duck-typed data basically. I havent looked at clojure's SQL stuff at all so i cant answer there.<p>Working with these fragments is real simple. Clutch deserializes the JSON from various couch views into native clojure data structures (maps, vecs, etc). From there i just use multimethods[1] to work out how to handle each fragment at various points (url generation, various aspects of the templating etc). I should note that cgrand created a great little macro for me to make working with enlive and multis easier, <a href=""http://gist.github.com/432752"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gist.github.com/432752</a><p>The hardest part about migrating the nominal schema is changing the JS for the views. Clutch does support running a clojure view server for couch which i think would actually alleviate a lot of my pain points but I wasn't on the ball when i got started. I store all my views in little JS files in the project and have some shamefully rough clojure scripts to update the views in the DB.<p>Migrating existing data (which i've only had to do once) is a simple case of writing a map (and or filter) function and running it over all the content and doing a bulk update with couch.<p>I havent had to do much migration though because i largely ported over my established python/django project.<p>hopefully that answers your question?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://clojure.org/multimethods"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/multimethods</a>",1287552560

As a result my living space has decreased from 960 ft2 to 720 ft2, and now to 670 ft2.  In 4 months, I could consider downsizing again, probably to 550 ft2 or so.

What do I miss that I've gotten rid of?  Not a thing.  I now know where everything is.  It's getting increasingly easier to get at everything  Cleaning is simple.  A smaller space means lower utility bills (i.e. electric going from $80/mo to $35/mo).  Fewer clothes (that I never wear) means less laundry to do.  I still have some useless things that have sentimental value, and it'll probably take considerably more time before I consider passing those along.<p>Though most importantly, it leaves more money available for the things you really care about.

Jobs pointlessly decided to bash a few rivals in his speech on Monday, which I thought made him look pretty petty (roughly speaking I agree with the author of <a href=""http://www.betanews.com/joewilcox/article/What-is-Steve-Jobs-so-afraid-of/1287515970"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.betanews.com/joewilcox/article/What-is-Steve-Jobs...</a> though I wouldn't make the conclusion that his comments mean he is 'afraid').

""We think many customers are getting tired of being told what to think by Apple. And by the way, [here's what you should actually think]."" Really? Was that written by a 12 year old?<p>c.)

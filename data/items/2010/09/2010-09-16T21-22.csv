I can understand the frustration and I apologize that there is trouble accessing a Groupon purchase.  Unfortunately there could be a few things going on, so it's difficult to diagnose without discussing it directly.  Sometimes people just simply typed in a typo in their email when they purchased their Groupon and then are unable to get in to access it.  If you're still having trouble, please never hesitate to just give us a ring like weaksauce posted here, our number M-F 9am-5pm CST 877 788 7858.  Or, you can always email us too (even if it's after hours) and we will get back to you: support@groupon.com.  We have a staff working feverishly after hours to help as well!  
Please contact us and we'll get it figured out for you---if you were charged by us, you certainly should have a Groupon!<p>Regards,

1699255,comment,1698833,1699178,0,0,ejames,,,"What Groupon wants doesn't particularly matter to the situation.  Unless Groupon has somehow convinced you to sign a contract promising that you'll never give anyone a better discount than the Groupon, you can handle regular customers however you want - including customers who aren't doing business under Groupon terms, because their Groupon is expired and doesn't apply.  So:  ""Sure, Lucy.  Here you go.""<p>Now, there is a real barrier to just giving Lucy the deal.  The entire point of the blog post is that the discount was ruinously unaffordable and didn't attract customers.  When you can't make payroll, maybe you genuinely can't afford to comp six dollars of flavored water!  Or maybe you don't want to set the public precedent of honoring expired coupons when the coupons were bad business even during their active dates and an entire line of customers is listening to this exchange while waiting behind Lucy.  Maybe you get a flood of people digging out their expired coupons, or just demanding to be treated as well as Lucy - exactly what you can't afford.  If something is unsustainable then you need to stop sustaining it, and that means there has to be a first person you tell ""No.""<p>I suspect that was the sense in which the original poster said she ""can't"" give Lucy the deal:  The deal can't be continued - it's been a disaster - it can't go on.  Strictly speaking, you have the power to treat customers however you want, but at the end of a bad business decision related to customer discounts, it's only human to frame everything in terms of ""we need to get out of this bad deal.""<p>But taking the Groupon deal at a bad price, such that she painted herself into a corner with her best customer, was still the original poster's own mistake.<p>I feel it would be unambiguously better, in a social and moral sense, if Groupon provided more advice and guidance to discount providers so that they don't risk going out of business.  The mistakes may have been the responsibility of Posie's Cafe, but problems are problems, and Groupon wasn't exactly an uninterested bystander in the issue.  I think it would probably be better for Groupon's long-term economic interests as well; if you burn your business partners, you earn a bad reputation, and eventually you run out of people who haven't heard the nasty rumors.",1284673405

Will have to investigate raik more, just haven't quite gotten my head around walking links.  Or how vwebmachine fits in.... Whether it is comparable to couch apps.<p>If you want a context in which to think of our product, think of it as a recommendation engine or search engine.

But changed my mind when i realized it didn't have an LRU.<p>As for cluster management, turn key Linux provides some of that, and otherwise it was just going to be keeping queues and load readings in the distributed cache so that large jobs could be distributed to less busy machines.  This doesn't seem like a big deal to me, because it wasn't even something we needed in a big way, though I didn't mention that.   But if someone has already done it feel free to let me know.<p>I also figured I'd need to write some scripts to have nodes join and leave the clusters, mostly calling the Apis built into the components of the stack....

There's thousands of transplants like myself coming in each year, yet, I don't know where to meet them or where to start in this formidable, diverse area. Help me crack this egg...<p>Since I'm a good tech nerd...
-I'm not terribly into playing sports so joining my local *ball/board/bike club/team would be a faux, contrived effort.
-I'd be considered a little on the shy side before extroverted.
-I'm into techy things, of course. I like reading TechCrunch, HN, programming, soldering things, etc.<p>However, unlike most tech nerds...
-There's a limit to how much I want to talk about tech. Friday night at 10PM? No. Saturday at noon while strolling the Mission? Sure.
-I like to have good conversation over a few beers, anytime. I'm not socially challenged. I invite the proposition of meeting other people and drinking in a bar. The thought of doing anything that's not having fun, crazy adventures on a Friday/Saturday night is uncomfortable to me.<p>Also, unlike most companies in the Valley, my company tends to be secretive. As such, there are large proverbial walls between teams so it's hard to meet people. We just don't have general interest mailing lists, endless special interest groups (we have ~20), openness, and lots of offsites and team builders. Combine that with the fact that everyone on my team is in their 30s/40s and just had children and I'm stuck on that front. I've even tried the local alumni chapter. They also all fall in this age range.<p>So, to that end, folks, I need your help.<p>Previous tech companies I've worked at practically came with a complimentary group of friends and events as soon as you walked in the door. Now, it's the real world, I've graduated college, and long-term relationships are harder to find.<p>Thoughts? Ideas? Clubs? Sympathizers?<p>(I seriously think this could be a startup, too. I'd pay some money to go on fun events/trips with other Bay Area newbs.)",1284671731

We are young company in online ads space making less that 100k sales/month.<p>We just found that one of our competitors are clearly scaming their clients. They are company with 30M+ funding, famous investors, few products etc.<p>They are charging their clients (big brands) x2-3 more for more expensive things while in practice delivering cheap thing. We collected all the evidence, screenshots etc.<p>We are in relatively small niche market, where all players are well known and so they are effectively stealing our clients/money.<p>What should we do?<p>1) Bring the evidence to press(techcrunch etc) and try to start another scamville? If so, should we do this anonymously or ask to name ourself? Would it harm our reputation as we are their competitors?<p>2) Prepare report and send it to their clients?<p>3) Contact them or their investors<p>4) Start doing the same thing :) This is not really an option since method is quite obvious and it will be uncovered sooner or later by someone.<p>5) Something else?<p>Thanks in advance!",1315889985

2989986,comment,2989352,2989352,3,0,evgen,,,"When reading this so many red-flag warnings popped up that I could not decide if they were deluded or frauds.  I will give them the benefit of the doubt and simply guess that they are deluded regarding the storage savings they will eventually realize via de-dupe.  Given that the founding team includes a bizdev guy, a marketing guy, and a sysadmin/ops guy I am guessing that they can put together a nice pitch and powerpoint, have some easy answers to the operational problems of competing in this space, and have a lot of hand-waving answers to the harder technical problems.  The latter problem will probably end up killing them unless we are just seeing a PR dump in preparation for a pivot to being just another online backup company.<p>One major fly in this whole ""de-dupe"" claim is that it will probably not even work out for them even if they did have some magic sauce to dance around the de-dupe/crypto conflict others have noted.  The problem is that the files which users actually care about and want to back up are not the common files but the ones which make their data unique; it is not the mp3s or hollywood videos that matter, it is the data/content that each person has created that matters.  If my disks crashed, my online and offline backups were corrupted, and I needed to rebuild my system I could get the common OS files in a hour, the mp3s and videos would take a few weeks of passive torrenting, but the pictures, home videos, and personal documents would be gone forever.  It is these files that matter for a backup services, and they are not going to be something that you can de-dupe even if they were not encrypted.<p>Back when the term ""de-dupe"" did not exist and convergent encryption was something we were inventing before the term existed the thought was that a backup service employing these techniques would enjoy a massive savings in storage costs -- it turned out that people cared less about backing up the data that was easy to de-dupe and original data was a much larger portion of what users uploaded than we expected.  This was back when pics were a meg or two and personal video was low bitrate, now that even a mobile phone is dumping multi-meg pictures and you can get a HD video camera for a hundred bucks I cannot imagine how anyone would convince themselves that de-dupe is going to make any significant difference to the operational costs of such a service.",1315889402

2989981,comment,2982965,2987508,1,0,David_Rothstein,,,"Er, your accusations about Acquia here are both incorrect and offensive.<p>For the record, Acquia was only marginally involved in getting the new database API into Drupal 7 in the first place (probably 95% or more of the work and technical direction for this particular feature was contributed by non-Acquians).  Also, given that we (Acquia) own a <i>MySQL-based</i> Drupal website hosting business (and don't really have MSSQL or Oracle expertise on staff so it's certainly not our preference to have clients who want to run Drupal on those systems), the implication that this was some kind of Acquia-directed conspiracy really makes no sense.<p>Also, the primary motivation of the new database API was certainly not to support these proprietary database systems anyway.  Other databases whose code is free (especially SQLite, which is now supported directly in Drupal 7 core) are much more important.  And cross-database support is definitely not the only useful feature of the new database API, just one of them.  I would suggest reading e.g. <a href=""http://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/database-tng-lands"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/database-tng-lands</a> for more information.<p>Regarding CCK, it's hard to understand why you are so concerned about features being ""locked"" in Drupal core for the next few years?  For one thing, they're not locked (certain features might still be added to Drupal 7 if they don't change things in a way that will break existing code), but more important, the entire way Drupal works is that core functionality can easily be <i>extended</i> by contrib modules to meet additional needs.  As described in the link I provided earlier, the functionality you're looking for is apparently being implemented by the Field Collection module in Drupal 7 (and due to the Field API, it's being done in a way that knowledgeable people seem to agree is much better than any implementation that would be possible with CCK in Drupal 6).  So it's not really clear why are you are apparently comfortable typing ""drush dl cck"" to install CCK for Drupal 6, but not comfortable typing ""drush dl field_collection"" to install this (or other) modules you might need for Drupal 7.",1315889329

2989968,comment,2989087,2989873,2,0,SwellJoe,,,"Windows only has ""user-installable drivers"" if you don't pay attention to the fact that you're effectively sudo-ing when installing them. Driver installation is an Administrator level task, as it should be. On a Linux system, when you're in Gnome and use a GUI package manager to install a driver or any other package, you will be asked for a password to either su to root (on Fedora/RHEL/CentOS) or sudo (Ubuntu). This is the same as being asked to confirm on Windows when running as a user with administrative privileges.<p>And, I'm not sure I buy that Linux is a backwards wasteland on this front. It has more drivers than current Windows versions, and more of my hardware, particularly stuff that's more than two or three years old, Just Works in Linux. I usually have to go digging on the web to find drivers for at least a few devices on any particularly laptop or desktop machine when I install Windows. That's usually only the case for more advanced 3D drivers on Linux.<p>Windows <i>does</i> have a more stable ABI (the last change, I think was from XP to Vista), while Linux does not. This could be argued to be a point in Windows favor. When the ABI changes, a driver on Linux has to be recompiled. This was historically defended by Linus based on the fact that the majority of Windows crashes are caused by 3rd party drivers...and Linus wanted Linux to be as immune to those poorly made 3rd party drivers as possible by making it hard for them to exist. Drivers in Linux, generally speaking, would go across Linus' screen (or at least one of his lieutenants) at some point, making it possible to insure a high level of quality and consistency in anything that ended up in a position of being able to bring a Linux system down. Linux historically has extremely admirable reliability because of this (and other factors).<p>The trade-off is that 3rd parties, like hardware companies, cannot release a driver and forget about it. A driver for Linux released in binary-only form today will not be useful in a year or sometimes even a few months. But, that's also proven to be true for Windows now that Microsoft has changed the driver ABI and raised the barriers to building drivers for Windows. A Windows XP driver is useless on Windows 7, so vast swaths of previously Windows-compatible hardware is no longer usable with Windows.<p>Linux also has apt-get (or yum) for drivers. When you update your kernel, you update all of your drivers to the latest version. Since drivers are tiny and disks are big, there's little reason to have them all packaged up separately. And, Debian/Ubuntu and RHEL have methods of distributing drivers separately from the kernel in package form. It's just rarely used, since so many drivers are included in the kernel.<p>So, I have historically found Windows to have better driver support, and it is occasionally more convenient to get hardware running under Windows than Linux. But, the gap has shrunk remarkably in recent years (nVidia and ATI both provide pretty good drivers for Linux now, and Intel has for a very long time), and lately I'm more often frustrated by Windows than Linux, since I have some older hardware that was quite expensive that I'd rather not replace (multi-channel 24 bit Firewire audio interface, for instance) that no longer gets driver updates from the vendor. It goes both ways, and I don't believe it is as cut and dried as it was even a few years ago.",1315888916

How are you going to double your energy consumption?<p>Is your home going to take twice as much energy to heat? No. If anything, it'll take less as increasing energy prices make insulation pay off even sooner.<p>Is your gadget collection going to take twice as much energy? Probably not. TVs are getting more efficient as a side effect of other issues. As your computers go portable they <i>have</i> to consume less energy unless batteries get better in a way they aren't likely to in 10 years. What will a 2021 home computing device do with 200 watts?

And in general the acquisition of ""stuff"" seems to be slowing down and will continue to slow down; media collections that were once walls of books and plastic VCR tapes are now downloads and some bits on a disk.<p>What would you <i>do</i> with twice the energy budget, if you're already a middle-class American?<p>It is true that economic activity has been correlated to energy output, and it's a bit soon to start shutting down the oil companies. But there's an ever-increasing amount of economic output being done in the form of knowledge (of how to build better cars, etc), and in just-plain-bits, and we can have a looooot of such output for not very many terawatts. I expect that we are probably going to see the peak mass-energy-resource-environment-consumption per person in the US peak in the next 10 years, then start inexorably trending downwards for a very long time after that. (As others observe, this is not an announcement of that peak, but I think we're going there.)<p>Incidentally, that's one of the interesting questions to ask of anyone who ever mentions the Kardashev scale... what exactly is the civilization <i>doing</i> with the entire output of the Galaxy, assuming it also basically has perfectly efficient manufacturing and computing processes?

We have a clear problem: higher level languages make programmers more productive, but they have performance issues. Because of those, developers that need performance fall back to C++ (look at videogame development, C++ is there to stay).<p>So why not make a language that is high level, but compiles to pure, cross platform, C++? Think of the productivity win:  a higher level language that rarely needs optimizations. Obviously it would have to come with some lower level semantics, like memory management (although it could maybe be solved somehow like Apple did with Automatic Reference Counting, which is basically a preprocessor) or static typing (although the compiler can sometimes be instructed to guess the type, see the := operator in ooc [1]), but even if some lower level semantics are unavoidable, it still seems like a huge win. Yet every time I saw the idea mentioned online it's been either mostly ignored or treated as stupid idea, and the very few projects that attempted to go in that direction never took off. Maybe I'm missing something? If so I'd love to know what it is.<p>No matter how fancy and awesome higher level languages are, we keep going back to C++ for performance, and that's probably never going to change (at least until processors are stupidly fast). So why not make it easier? The CoffeeScript approach has largely been proven to work.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.ooc-lang.org/language/syntax.html#declarations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.ooc-lang.org/language/syntax.html#declarations</a> (note that ooc is a good step in this direction, it compiles to C99, but then takes step back: it depends on a garbage collector)",1315887933

Loading Javascript (Even in bytecode form) requires running the code. Modern desktop/server software leverages tons of code via shared-libraries with fast startup times, but Javascript webpages have horrible startup times with only tiny amounts of library code. This problem is important to fix or the javascript ecosystem will be prevented from effectively building higher and higher leverage software layers.<p>In addition, Javascript's abstractions are based on relatively slow mechanisms such as dynamic-hashes. This make it difficult if not impossible to get C/Java/C# like performance out of it even with a JIT. You can build fast dynamic hashes out of structs, but you can't really build fast structs out of dynamic hashes.",1315887179

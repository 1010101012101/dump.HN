In something like Javascript, everything else is so loose, it's like why not use strings, but I've always wondered why things like HTTP headers couldn't be handled using enums. I think it would cover a lot of the cases mentioned in the article without having a weird-at-first-glance abstract string paradigm to deal with.<p>As a practical matter, I think enums couldn't be used in the Java spec because it was written before enums were available in the language. Enums also suffer from extensibility issues, but that could be solved by having stringly-typed overrides. I've also been contemplating the possible merits of extensible enums for solving issues like this. So for example you could have an enum type that extends the HttpHeader enum. The ordinality would be weird if there were multiple sub-enums, but it might not matter for most practical cases. I can think of a few language-level ways to deal with the ordinality issue too.",1369497055

So when facebook does take the extraordinary measure to remove content after the fact, they are actively censoring rather than not publishing.<p>If you're going for the legal perspective, it's more complicated than that. Depending on jurisdiction, service provider immunity may not work after they're notified about the illegal content but decline to remove it. E.g. [1]. (Note that some causes of action may have more specific defences for operators of websites, e.g. [2]).<p>But really, that isn't relevant here. No-one's suggested that the image here's illegal. This is just about facebook being able to decline to publish whatever it likes.<p>> when facebook does take the extraordinary measure to remove content after the fact, they are actively censoring rather than not publishing<p>I don't agree. As you yourself pointed out two sentences before that one, facebook don't editorially filter stuff before putting it up. So if they're notified that a thing they don't want to host has been put up, any action they take is always going to be ""after the fact""!<p>How can the right line to draw be between a provider that filters after publishing and one that filters before, such that the former is ""censoring"" but the latter is ""not publishing""? Filtering after publishing (in response to user reports) is, for a website with a userbase the size of facebook's, just more efficient than doing it before. I don't see any moral difference between the two, just a practical one.<p>(And FWIW, I think you <i>way</i> over-interpreted netrus' comment.

Many of us who'd been doing web development for years at that time had either used or created similar or better frameworks in languages like Perl, Tcl, Python and even Java. These frameworks were usually kept internal to the organization that developed them, however, so they were obviously nowhere near as widely used.<p>DHH was of minimal importance, too. Yes, he was somewhat of a visible figure head and spokesman for the project, but that was about it. For the average Ruby on Rails user, DHH didn't have much of an impact.<p>In my opinion, Ruby on Rails brought together several distinct groups of young men (women are still very rare in the Ruby on Rails community) who'd typically been outcasts within the computing industry. They included:<p>1) Less-talented UI, web and graphic designers. These people, unable to find work in more traditional software development, print media, and other fields, ended up moving toward web development, where the bar to entry was set much lower.<p>2) Less-talented software developers. These people, either due to age, a lack of experience, a lack of education, or a lack of natural ability, were inherently drawn to Rails. It provided the rigid structure (""convention over configuration"") that they needed in order to get anything done. It also allowed them to continue to avoid learning SQL and proper database design techniques, while creating something that partially worked (even if the result lacked severely in terms of performance and reliability).<p>3) Attention-seeking youth. We all know who these people are. They're the ones who repeatedly wrote loud, profanity-ridden ""articles"" full of anger. Or they created absurd, cryptic writings and art, and then spontaneously vanished, creating much unnecessary drama. Many of them were also self-styled ""hipsters"", who just went out of their way to be different merely for the sake of being different.<p>Ruby on Rails provided something these people could all rally around. It gave them a common cause, if you will. And they rallied around this cause quite loudly, which generated an immense amount of hype relative to what they were able to accomplish, or what their software provided. This helped draw in more and more of these outcasts, making the community larger and larger.<p>I think that GNOME 3, for instance, is a result of spillover from this newly-formed community into existing, established open source communities. Members of a community formed solely around a lack of merit forced their way en masse into what was once a near-total meritocracy, and as would be expected, disaster was the result.",1369494120

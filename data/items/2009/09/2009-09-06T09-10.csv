807648,story,,,12,3,olliesaunders,"Taoism and Functional Programming: In Place",,"Like functional programming, Taoism aggressively minimises mutability. A true Taoist seeks to change the world as little as possible and refrains from acting as much as he can, creating the stable foundation on which Taoism is built and removing changing context from decisions of right and wrong. This allows Taoism to appear wise, possessing many hallmarks of wisdom in spades:<p>- Logically true.
- Universally applicable.
- Highly abstract.
- Foreign concepts.<p>But how wise is Taoism really? Once you outlaw mutability, Taoism is merely a collection of virtues deftly derived from logical extension, no more impressive that the logical extensions a programming language designer makes from an established paradigm.<p>Immutability is not without merits, but, if you value mutability in life (and most of us do), Taoism cannot be accepted. The best alternative then, is to understand that a virtuous life is not achieved principally through the application of very abstract concepts (these are few), but through the rapid mastery of relative, changing, specifics: A virtuous country is one that adapts its laws fastest to a changing world; a virtuous person is one who does not hesitate to change his opinion when it has been proven wrong; etc.",1252230995

From a quick glance at these slides, I get the impression that Haskell would be very good at doing parallel calculations (it's fast), but am not quite so certain about doing parallel system tasks, like sockets, something I know Erlang is good at.

807631,comment,807117,807117,0,0,gjm11,,,"It's certainly worth understanding what's happening one level down from the level you work at, at least. Sometimes even lower-level effects seep through -- e.g., even if you're writing in something like Haskell it's probably worth having an understanding of memory hierarchy issues. I'm not convinced that ""machine code (not assembler -- machine code)"" buys you much over assembler, though.<p>I'd guess that much more software slowness comes from other failings, though. Poorly chosen algorithms that would make for slow performance even if written in machine code and microoptimized by experts. Forgetting that a random disc read takes millions of CPU cycles. That sort of thing.<p>(Most of the programmers I've worked with have been writing embedded stuff, or close enough to others who are doing so, that they have some exposure to assembler-level thinking. Though I expect those of us who grew up in the age of 8-bit micros could still teach most of them a trick or two.)",1252228571

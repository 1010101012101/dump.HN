Together with Joe Lieberman he introduced the Federal Research Public Access Act (FRPAA) into Congress in 2006.  This Act would, if passed, make almost all scientific publications funded by the US Govt openly accessible within 6 months of publication:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Research_Public_Access_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Research_Public_Access_...</a><p>The act has not yet passed.  It was re-proposed in 2010 and 2012, each time with increased support from a bi-partisan group of sponsors, in both Houses.  Cornyn is still a sponsor.<p>My understanding is that Cornyn was instrumental in the passage of the 2008 NIH public access policy, which makes NIH-funded research available within 6 months of publication:<p><a href=""http://publicaccess.nih.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publicaccess.nih.gov/</a><p>This is by far the largest victory for open access to date.   It would, however, be eclipsed by FRPAA, should it pass.<p>Given all this, I believe it is natural that Cornyn has an interest in the case, and questions.",1358549940

Car payment is $200-$250 a month, insurance is $100 a month, gas is $50 a month, and call it an amortized $100 a month for repairs and other expenses. In total, an average car costs $500 a month. And never mind the cost for parking. In contrast, passes for public transportation cost somewhere from $50-$100, _but_ you can usually get them subsidized and/or pre-tax. In Boston, I'm able to get an unlimited pass through my employer for $35 pre-tax a month and my car costs me $500 post-tax a month. In major cities, cars are strictly a luxury.

It still requires agreement between the parties on what it means, and it doesn't require any logic to be understood - just a common psychological framework plus similar cultural experiences. And same with the raised fist.<p>> The method must be logical in its formation because otherwise it can't be sure it is understood by both parties.<p>Again I don't know what you mean by ""logical"". Logic is universal and absolute and doesn't change. But while languages each have an internal consistency, they're all very different from each other, and each of them evolves quite drastically given enough time.<p>How could language have ever developed if it needed to be logical for it to be understood? Seems to me all you need is a bit of empathy and some dexterous body parts (fingers/arms, vocal cords/tongue) to build a real language starting from pointing and gesturing and grunting, none of which is at all systematic.<p>Over time, I think modern languages developed that internal consistency because their users needed to express more and more complicated ideas. If the idea I'm conveying to you has lots of actors and actions and nuanced imagery in it, things have to be orderly and highly patterned-based or else I know that you will not understand. So we all mutually agreed on an arbitrary system for these things.",1358549540

The problem becomes how we express business logic in C and I.<p>I know there is Role even though it did not appear in the DCI. We pass data to context as different roles.

The experience of ""wisdom arising by objectively observing sensations without reaction"" is easily the most profound experience I have ever had and feels like a miracle every time it happens.  The answers we are all looking for to fulfill ourselves and become truly happy certainly are inside of us.  We just have to be willing to sit and do nothing and watch as the ""law of nature"" (Dhamma) takes over and we act perfectly in accordance with it from moment to moment, as it is, not as we want it to be.<p>In every retreat, I experience the most mind-numbing boredom, severe burning fiery pain, full body bliss the likes of which I cannot even recollect properly and a huge gamut of sensations in between all of these extremes.  I've misinterpreted the extreme experiences at given times and each retreat learn a little bit more about their true nature.  I can then apply what I learn to my life when I experience boredom, pain and extreme joy and learn to experience each ""properly"".<p>The trick is finding the ardent awareness that allows you to stay there, on the path, without distraction.  And then to learn how to stay that ardently aware as you go through life.\nHopefully the retreat doesn't stay an isolated 10 day experience but its import, particular the technique itself, is something you can cultivate throughout your life, while sitting, walking, standing and lying down.",1358548340

5081443,comment,5080210,5080210,53,0,haberman,,,"These ""faster than C"" claims are almost always embarrassing (usually involving C code that would easily win if it were as aggressively optimized as the high-level language) but that's almost not the point.<p>The real point is the larger narrative.  The subtext of these posts is what we are really arguing about.  So let's just duke that out directly.<p>High-level language fans have a point, which is that high-level languages are sometimes an better overall ""bang for the buck"" in developer time, and that sometimes they can be pretty fast (possibly even out-performing an un-optimized C program).  Reasonable C guys aren't arguing against this.  We're certainly not arguing that people should use C for everything.<p>But here's what high-level language fans have to understand.  First of all, you depend on us.  Your language runtime is (very likely) implemented in our language (possibly with a little assembly thrown in).  So as much as you may like your language, it certainly does not <i>obsolete</i> C.  C guys like me get cranky when high-level language fans imply that it does.<p>Second of all, a C+ASM approach will <i>always</i> win eventually, given enough time invested.  That is because a C+ASM programmer has at his/her disposal literally every possible optimization technique that is implementable on that CPU, with no language-imposed overhead.  What this means is that a higher-level language being ""faster than C"" is just a local maximum; the global maximum is that C is faster.<p>Yes, it's absolutely true that in limited development timeframes a higher-level language might still be the right choice, and in rare cases might even have better performance.  But for long-term projects that want the absolute best performance, C (or C++) are still the only choice.  (But maybe Rust someday).",1358548102

It is harmful to have within your semantic environment both ""spiritual"" factors such as the notion of ""aetheric body"", and scientific factors such as the notion of ""space-time"" (which currently shape our civilisation). This is because the two belong to inconsistent sets, so they conflict.<p>Edit: For a more relevant example, consider the implicit assumption of many ""spiritual"" doctrines that there is a ""soul"", which is separated from a ""mind"", which is separated from a ""body"". This contrasts with our modern scientific assumptions, that there is just an organism-as-a-whole-in-an-environment, which functions as such. The word ""organism"" is more recent than ""Sankharas""! As such, it doesn't carry with itself the older metaphysics.<p>Also, consider our modern scientific perspective that we don't drop into this world from a vacuum  we come from an environment, the uterus.

The difference between selling groceries and waiting on tables is that in the former there is a tangible item with an intrinsic value to which the law of exclusion strictly applies. The latter has an intangible and subjective value behind it, and the law of exclusion is as flexible as a wet noodle. The thing about the Internet is that it's all subjective and intangible, making the gratuity model vastly more appropriate. That doesn't make intangible work valueless, it just changes the business model. We have never seen such an expansive gratuity-based business opportunity as the Internet before. I can also understand how that might be a bitter thing to admit if one prefers, or depends on, the law of exclusion. (Of course, it is also possible to ""inflict"" the law of exclusion on netizens with laws such as copyright, the CFAA, etc, but that it's not the clear moral high road.)<p><i>""having your IP address is looking at your property from afar, logging in to your SSH and taking your files is picking the lock (or swinging the gate open) and walking in and taking something.""</i><p>No, they are both just network traffic.

It may also be a pedantic truism, but ""copyright infringement"" and copying generally are semantically and functionally different from ""theft."" (Copying: 1+1=2; theft: 1-1=0.) IMHO, it's not necessary to presume that copies themselves need to be restricted on top of the criminal ends (damages, theft of value, etc).

However, these possibilities are still only marginally used. We argue for the implementation of (1) peer-reviewed peer review, (2) transparent editorial hierarchies, and (3) online data publication. First, peer-reviewed peer review entails a community-wide review system in which reviews are published online and rated by peers. This ensures accountability of reviewers, thereby increasing academic quality of reviews. Second, reviewers who write many highly regarded reviews may move to higher editorial positions. Third, online publication of data ensures the possibility of independent verification of inferential claims in published papers. This counters statistical errors and overly positive reporting of statistical results. We illustrate the benefits of these strategies by discussing an example in which the classical publication system has gone awry, namely controversial IQ research. We argue that this case would have likely been avoided using more transparent publication practices. We argue that the proposed system leads to better reviews, meritocratic editorial hierarchies, and a higher degree of replicability of statistical analyses.""",1358547774

Granted, English is not my first language but I would say ""happiness"" includes both ""emotional well being"" and ""life evaluation"", and maybe even with more emphasis on the latter when contrasted with, say, ""joy"" which is the one that pertains more to the short-term states, isn't that right?<p>As a concrete not money-related example, parents of young children probably typically don't have very good ""emotional well being"" as defined above, but nevertheless by every account I've heard they're usually very happy, which means precisely their ""life evaluation"" is high.",1358546834

It's not called that because some language completely unrelated to Java called itself that already :)<p>To reply to some of your points:<p>The syntax is designed to look like Java.  It's there for Java programmers, not to be the best syntax ever.  (new is important, however, because you can also create objects with const.)  Yeah, it's not Python.<p>Production and development mode are a common optimization in other languages.  Remember: type annotations in Dart cannot, by design, change the behavior of the application.  So in production mode, that part of the language spec is enforced.  Static analysis tools, etc., are free to do whatever they want, however.  I'd rather catch type errors at code review time rather than at runtime in production anyway.<p>The constructors make sense to me.  They work like Java, and there is better syntax for initializing fields (which is all I ever do in constructors anyway).<p>Ultimately, it's Java in client-side form.

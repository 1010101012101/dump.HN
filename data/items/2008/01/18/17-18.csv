I've never written a comment this long, but just had to this time. Comparing an international trade deficit to buying books at a Barnes & Noble in a different town? I understand the schema, but it is nowhere near complete or accurate in its intention.<p>Buying books vs. running a trade deficit with Mexico. sure on a micro level the author can run a deficit with the city of Pittstown and still be OK, just as the US could run a deficit with Mexico and still be Ok. I'm assuming that the author is running a surplus in the city where he earns his living. That is the reason the deficit in Pittstown is manageable. The US is running a large deficit overall and therefore the situation is much less manageable.<p>This is a better analogy. The author has a job which makes $50k a year, yet he spends $75k a year\n= earnings < spending.<p>How does he spend more than he earns? With credit card debt of course. The US issues and sells bonds as debt.<p>The author argues that a deficit is better than a surplus because credit will eventually be cut, but someone can save forever not living to their full utility (economics term for enjoyment). If these scenarios play out, here are the outcomes.<p>The person running a deficit is in debt without the earning power to get out. In this situation they have to cut their spending significantly and hope they can afford to feed themselves. Remember they cannot borrow any more and eventually their assets may be repossessed.<p>The person running a surplus can maintain his current standard of living forever. Depending on the size of his savings, he may be able to quit his job and live off the interest of the savings. He has no debt, only savings, and can most likely increase his utility/standard of living without any further effort or consequences.<p>Both scenarios are equally good?",1200679074

100393,comment,100284,100373,0,0,sdurkin,,,"Yes, I would agree that is one of the many costs associated with a firm.<p>However, I would say that the point of the article is that the increased coordination and communication of firms outweighs the associated costs of the office environment at present.<p>One could argue that the internet makes the office/firm model of doing business obsolete by reducing the costs of outsourcing. To some extent this has already happened in the open source community as well as in user generated content websites such as wikipedia. In these cases, sophisticated projects are designed and built by individuals working at many locations.<p>The crucial (and seemingly odd) distinction is that these projects are undertaken by individuals for no pay.  I would argue that this allows some flexibility in the projects. Jobs, money, and lives rely far less on the success of an open-source project than on the success of a profit driven firm.<p>It remains to be seen whether the contribution model of wikipedia could be translated to a bid model that would replace the traditional for-profit firm.  In some industries, such as programming, the bid model has lower costs of decreased cooperation, and thus has occurred more quickly. However, I cannot see it taking root in ""heavier"" industries (engineering, manufacturing, consumer services) without a significant improvement in computer communication tools.",1200678224

Perhaps some sort of wireless internet instead of the copper cables we have in the UK at the moment[1], I don't see British Telecom giving us all fiber any time soon.<p>[1] Wild Friday afternoon speculation of course.",1200678208

100384,comment,100319,100360,0,0,ecommercematt,,,"It doesn't surprise me that this is a common concern in YC startups. It also doesn't surprise me that the Reddit guys gave the issue consideration.<p>I agree that limiting the ability to suppress news, even if some people take advantage of increasing openness to advance harmful agendas, is a positive trend. I used to regularly derive enjoyment from Reddit, and occasionally, I still do. Nonetheless, I think Reddit's struggle with various forms of abuse (by idiots, racists, spammers, etc.), is relevant to those of us working on community driven web-based projects (even if ""community-driven,"" and ""web-based"" are the only traits in common with Reddit, as is the case with my startup). If I were one of Reddit's founders, I'd be troubled by its current state, and I want to do whatever I can to prevent similar problems from happening to our site.<p>As to what I meant by hate speech, I'll lean on Justice Potter Stewart's words regarding the definition of pornography:<p>""I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it...""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it</a><p>There is plenty of hate speech on Reddit, and I know it when I see it.<p>The first time I discovered your (pg's) existence was when I received a link to your essay ""What You Can't Say.""<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/say.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/say.html</a><p>You said in that essay ""like every other era in history, our moral map almost certainly contains a few mistakes."" I agree with you. Nonetheless, I'm sure that it isn't a mistake to consider white supremacist propaganda, for example, to be harmful to society.<p>I'd be surprised if you haven't encountered hate speech on Reddit, but perhaps you haven't. I imagine it wouldn't take you long to find, if you tried, as I have stumbled across it quite regularly by accident. Regardless, the particulars of my critique of Reddit aren't relevant. Figuring out how to make a community good, and keep it good, is my goal. The consensus here appears to be that an ounce of bad sprinkled in with tons of good is still worth it. I agree, but I'm still going to think about how to reduce that ounce to a gram, or less. Any ideas would be appreciated.",1200677559

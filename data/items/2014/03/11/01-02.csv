7376970,comment,7376820,7376917,8,0,a_bonobo,,,"> It can be devilishly difficult to distinguish between someone who is lying and someone who is misinformed, and that task becomes exponentially more complicated when the underlying &quot;fact&quot; is itself uncertain.<p>Another good example (IMHO) is the case of academic fraud. Often, the researchers&#x27; assumptions bias the entire study, leading to a result that an unbiased researcher wouldn&#x27;t get. For example, the biased researcher pools groups that shouldn&#x27;t be pooled, or the biased researcher doesn&#x27;t log-normalize data that should be log-normalized, leading to &quot;wrong&quot; results. Edit: But most of the time, the researcher doesn&#x27;t even realize that (s)he is biased.<p>On the other hand, we have researchers who clearly have monetary interests behind their publications: Séralini comes to mind who publishes biased books on GMOs but also publishes extremely biased research, or all the &quot;bad pharma&quot; as described in Ben Goldacre&#x27;s book of the same name.<p>There have been cases where &quot;obvious&quot; scientific fraud has been investigated by the police, for example in Italy [1] or South Korea [2], but the slope is truly slippery. Where do you draw the line between &quot;honest mistake&quot; and &quot;lie&quot;?<p>Furthermore, most countries already have a problem with more and more scientists dropping out of science, which will only be exacerbated if you can go to prison for a huge mistake.<p>[1] <a href=""http://retractionwatch.com/2013/12/06/should-scientific-misconduct-be-handled-by-the-police-its-fraud-week-at-nature-and-nature-medicine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://retractionwatch.com/2013/12/06/should-scientific-misc...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/2009/091026/full/4611181a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/2009/091026/full/4611181a.html</a>",1394503122

They&#x27;re not really skeptics in the philosophical sense-- their skepticism is strictly reserved for certain fashionable-to-criticize outsider positions.

7376943,comment,7376113,7376701,5,0,stopcodon,,,"This will come off as a strawman, but the same could be said for every drug ever prescribed. There&#x27;s absolutely no way to quantify the effects an &quot;unnatural&quot; molecule will have on a human body, since everyone will have physiological differences, and there will be a near infinite number of environmental factors. The best we can do is use the sum of human knowledge as a framework to test that drug to the best of our ability, and try to figure out if it&#x27;s safe by examining the evidence.<p>I&#x27;m an agricultural geneticist (not in industry, I have never worked on GMOs but I do keep up to date on the literature so I can educate others), so I will be biased here, but GMOs have been very carefully examined for decades with no credible evidence to suggest they pose a threat to human health.<p>Without going in to a lesson on population genetics, most genes, even if they found their way in to a natural population outside of a farm, would not spread in the population because of selection against them. Empirically the frequency of this kind of spread from crop to natural population has been found to be nearly non-existent, which is why it&#x27;s not a huge concern.<p>Humans have been causing artificial selection on plants for thousands of years. Breeding for completely unnatural traits, and even crossing entirely different species to create novel organisms for agriculture. GMOs are far more controlled in this sense, where you know exactly what you&#x27;re doing to the genome. Combining two genomes separated by millions of years of evolution at random through forced sexual reproduction in plants happens every day in crop breeding but nobody cares because it has this arbitrary label of &quot;natural&quot;, presumably because it doesn&#x27;t involve some sinister figure in a labcoat.<p>Unfortunately the anti-GMO activists do an excellent job of spreading misinformation and distrust of scientists to the public. The large biotech companies can do very little for the PR of GMOs, leaving academics to try and fight against the tide of hatred for what is actually an incredible tool for solving the worlds food shortages. Sadly most scientists are too busy writing grants to bother.",1394502721
7376942,comment,7375642,7376818,2,0,dap,,,"> Anything where you want an image to be guaranteed consistent, even if not complete, could use an ordering guarantee without a particular &quot;this has been written now&quot; guarantee.  A log-structured data store where you don&#x27;t mind a bit of data loss if there&#x27;s a power outage is a particularly clear example of that, but it&#x27;s a useful property in general.<p>So a little bit of data loss is okay, but a lot isn&#x27;t?  How does a program or operator determine how much is okay and how much isn&#x27;t?  How does the application ensure that that limit isn&#x27;t exceeded?  Without answers to these questions, it feels like &quot;you&#x27;ll probably be fine, but I can&#x27;t be sure of anything&quot;, which feels pretty lame.  But if a little data loss really is okay, then forget about both ordering and fsync and truncate the log after the last consecutive valid record.<p>> The problem appears to be that today there&#x27;s only &quot;write this all out now and DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE until that happens&quot;, and &quot;yeah, whatever, write it whatever order you like and I sure hope it all works out.&quot;\n> Is that correct?<p>I don&#x27;t think so, but it depends on what you mean by &quot;absolutely nothing else&quot;.  You can always use other threads, and on most systems, you can do lots of useful I/O with reasonable performance while an fsync() is going on.<p>> There really isn&#x27;t anything like a write barrier?<p>Other than fsync() and equivalents, I don&#x27;t know of one.  Non-blocking write barriers would represent a much more complicated abstraction for both applications and the filesystem, and (as you can tell from my comments on this thread) I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the complexity for any rigorous program.",1394502681

We are bombarded by rubbish &#x27;science&#x27; reporting, which when criticized, hides behind the banner of science. God forbid any of the articles in the Science section of most major newspapers actually scale the reporting to the actual significance of the finding/article.<p>Often it is usually cheap journalism that goes with a crazy headline (eg. AIDS cure found in mice) reporting on some preliminary study that is suggestive at best, and often a PR stunt for a researcher/lab (supported and indeed recommended by the named institution).<p>There are also a ton of opinion pieces and blogs that use data analysis or &#x27;science&#x27; to push an agenda. That&#x27;s great when it adheres to the scientific method, but often they don&#x27;t or the argument it is justifying isn&#x27;t in the field of science. Just because you crunched numbers does not mean you are doing science.<p>I have very well educated friends who assume that if an opinion is backed by statistics, then you are backed by facts, and conflate science with fact (as per @api&#x27;s point 3). Critical thinking doesn&#x27;t come into play. A lot of them do well in policy jobs!<p>We need more education on the scientific method, better criticism of poor science reporting in the media, and a desperate need for scientists to regain the public&#x27;s trust.

A good example of this is the securities laws. Fundamentally, they are predicated on the simple idea that it is illegal to lie in connection with the sale of securities.

Before combining values on the top row, keep hitting up until one of the lower rows will not combine from a left.<p>4.

For instance let kids study how to grow beans in different soils, take measures of stem diameter, height, quantify things, check hypotheses, make experiments!<p>Instead of teaching the method and providing a reasonable introductory education what popular science usually does is tell people not to worry, because there are scientists who already know not only the answers but the relevant questions through some magical hand-waving called Science that involves a lot of CGI.<p>So people can relax and be intellectually lazy because Science. This is wrong. Big Science is demanding, slow, hard, and can&#x27;t be indefinitely simplified without turning it into a lie. But science is a method, why don&#x27;t you show how it works?<p>There is a famous Feynman piece called &quot;Cargo Cult Science&quot; in which he tells a story about experiments with rats that gives the gist of it all:<p>&quot;All experiments in psychology are not of this type, however. For example, there have been many experiments running rats through all kinds of mazes, and so on with little clear result. But in 1937 a man named Young did a very interesting one. He had a long corridor with doors all along one side where the rats came in, and doors along the other side where the food was. He wanted to see if he could train the rats to go in at the third door down from wherever he started them off. No. The rats went immediately to the door where the food had been the time before.<p>The question was, how did the rats know, because the corridor was so beautifully built and so uniform, that this was the same door as before? Obviously there was something about the door that was different from the other doors. So he painted the doors very carefully, arranging the textures on the faces of the doors exactly the same. Still the rats could tell. Then he thought maybe the rats were smelling the food, so he used chemicals to change the smell after each run. Still the rats could tell. Then he realized the rats might be able to tell by seeing the lights and the arrangement in the laboratory like any commonsense person. So he covered the corridor, and still the rats could tell.<p>He finally found that they could tell by the way the floor sounded when they ran over it. And he could only fix that by putting his corridor in sand. So he covered one after another of all possible clues and finally was able to fool the rats so that they had to learn to go in the third door. If he relaxed any of his conditions, the rats could tell.<p>Now, from a scientific standpoint, that is an A-number-one experiment. That is the experiment that makes rat-running experiments sensible, because it uncovers that clues that the rat is really using, not what you think it&#x27;s using. And that is the experiment that tells exactly what conditions you have to use in order to be careful and control everything in an experiment with rat-running.<p>I looked up the subsequent history of this research. The next experiment, and the one after that, never referred to Mr. Young. They never used any of his criteria of putting the corridor on sand, or being very careful. They just went right on running the rats in the same old way, and paid no attention to the great discoveries of Mr. Young, and his papers are not referred to, because he didn&#x27;t discover anything about the rats. In fact, he discovered all the things you have to do to discover something about rats.

E.g. when looking for small restaurants or family owned hotels, an average website with average photos is fine and they are obviously not trying to hide something, it shows the real thing. However, a super-professional website with high-quality, photoshop-retouched photos... I know it won't be as good as it looks in the photos.<p>Then again, a web / mobile startup with bad graphics or design will suffer a lot from it because that should be one of their core competencies.",1338047888

I think there are a few reasons here. However, your actual question? No idea, I would love to see some stats, but I doubt it can be quantified that well (see point 3).<p>1. Someone in the executives actually likes the site the way it is. These are business people, not designers. I'm surprised time and again, how if you give a business person a logo drawn in crayon, they'll chose it, because it show synergy or whatever (slight exaggeration). Maybe a family member made the existing website for them. Even if they recognize there are other websites out there that look better, they cannot imagine that website with their logo and content. One company I worked with saw our wireframe and love it. It was so much better than what they had, even unfinished, and because it had their logo in the top corner, they were able to get it.<p>2. Costs are unknown. How much does it cost to make a new website for me? This guy says $500, this guy says $5000, what is the difference? These people are in the top of other fields. They know if their electrical contractor pushes them for 2 months and doubles the price whether its reasonable or not. They have no idea for web stuff.<p>3. Success cannot be easily quantified. Was the uptick in business as a result of a new design or the full marketing campaign you launched at the same time? (and I anticipate functionality far outweighs design, I mean, look at DrudgeReport, still extremely popular with a very basic design) And certainly depends industry to industry. A good design means far more to a web design company than it does to a electrical contractor.<p>(edit, added a little spacing)",1338047414

But, I am not an expert at this and am continually refreshing my rusty knowledge and have always thought it would be great to send data out to someone who is comfortable doing this and get it back charted from them.<p>Note that I am thinking small (every once in a while; small amounts of data). Something like a subscription service for a small monthly fee. Or the ability to do one time payment for one-off jobs. Things I would look for in such a service are (1) willingness to clean data a little bit (most times I get excel spreadsheets, but I always need to do some tweaking to how the data is presented) (2) support to do a NDA -- this is mostly so the company I am with doesn't get annoyed that I am sending sensitive data to a random outside service.<p>My needs might be small, but to me it seems like this might be a valuable service for organizations that continually handle large amounts of data.<p>Just a thought...",1338045028

Literacy, at best, gives access to the world's words, not the world's knowledge, and actually only the fraction of the words that are in the language in which one is literate.  I'm not just speaking of natural languages, either.  A considerable amount of the world's knowledge is expressed in the languages of mathematics and music, for which literacy in English is weak preparation.  Another enormous chunk of the world's knowledge is experiential, for which any language is a weak substitute for apprenticeship (at best) or mere doing (at least).<p>The world's knowledge lies behind and endless chain of conceptual hurdles, and the ease with which one can jump over these hurdles while running on the legs of literacy is determined by everything else that one studies.",1338044661

The color dimension allows the human eye to easily differentiate regions having similar densities (e.g., 70 vs 50).

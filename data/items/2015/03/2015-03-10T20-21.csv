So does the fact that the best McDonalds workers are only 1.2-1.5x as good as the average worker. So does the fact that McDonalds are rarely limited by number of staff; it scales well.<p>In the software world though we have a very different landscape. There is strong demand. The good are 5x better than the average, who are 5x better than the worst. And scaling a software team is incredibly inefficient due to communication overheads such that even if the average programmer was 5x cheaper the outputs of a team of 30 average programmers can be less than the output of 5 3x programmers.",1426021148

I really appreciate that you took the time to reply.<p>That being said, we do seem to have a significantly different interpretation of the Fourth and Sixth Amendments. Hooray! We&#x27;ve identified a big root cause of our disagreement! It&#x27;s a start.<p>Additionally, I do not agree that the Legislative has been sufficiently informed of mass surveillance programs, and sometimes they have even been knowingly misinformed[1][2][3].<p>Finally, I do not agree that the Judiciary have signed off on these programs. For the public-facing Judiciary, they haven&#x27;t even been able to get to the point where they can address the legality of these programs because the Executive have always blocked with standing and state secrets claims[4][5][6]. For the secret Judiciary, it seems that the Executive has also misled them[7][8]. Also, these courts are not adversarial, which opens them up to severe bias and capture[9][10].<p>Thanks again for your response. Would mind giving some citations to support your positions? I&#x27;ve tried to cite evidence for all of my positions.<p>Normally, the next step is to try to think of a set of criteria that would settle the differences. Here&#x27;s mine:<p>1. The Supreme Court rules that mass collection of domestic information by the Executive does not require a warrant (thus confirming your interpretation of the Fourth Amendment).<p>2. The Supreme Court rules that parallel construction is constitutional (thus confirming you interpretation of the Sixth Amendment).<p>What are yours? What criteria would change your position?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/06/06/watch-top-u-s-intelligence-officials-repeatedly-deny-nsa-spying-on-americans-over-the-last-year-videos/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/06/06/watch-t...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/04/congress-nsa-denied-access"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/04/congres...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/14/sanders-nsa-spying-congress-/4483351/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/14/sanders...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/supreme-court-dismisses-challenge-fisa-warrantless-wiretapping-law-effs-lawsuit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/supreme-court-dismisse...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union_v._National_Security_Agency"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union...</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/fbi-really-doesnt-want-anyone-to-know-about-stingray-use-by-local-cops/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/fbi-really-doesnt...</a><p>[7]: <a href=""https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130821/16331524274/declassified-fisa-court-opinion-shows-nsa-lied-repeatedly-to-court-as-well.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130821/16331524274/decla...</a><p>[8]: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/06/17/government_distorts_facts_on_nsa_targeting_americans_for_surveillance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/06/17/governmen...</a><p>[9]: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/20/fisa-court-nsa-without-warrant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/20/fisa-court-nsa-...</a><p>[10]: <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/2014/07/05/8139adf8-045a-11e4-8572-4b1b969b6322_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/2014/07/05/8139adf8-045a-11e4-...</a>",1426021107

9180572,comment,9178784,9180024,0,0,copsarebastards,,,"> People make this mistake all the time. The rich are paying the vast majority of all taxes paid, whether by income or property purchases.<p>This is true, but when you compare the percentages of the taxes that they pay to the percentage of the income that they enjoy, you&#x27;ll find that they are paying a smaller percentage of the taxes than they are enjoying the benefits of income. And that&#x27;s reported income: there are plenty of legal loopholes that allow the rich to legally avoid reporting large portions of their income.<p>>  What isn&#x27;t taxed is accumulated wealth and it should not be.<p>I agree with this, but this is used as an excuse for not taxing investments as highly--which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Income is income is income--it shouldn&#x27;t matter if that income comes from work or capital gains.<p>> The US has one of the most progressive systems in the world, one that harms competitiveness of businesses as well.<p>The US is one of the <i>least</i> progressive systems in the <i>developed</i> world. Sure, we&#x27;re more progressive than Somalia, but that&#x27;s to be expected.<p>> The simplest solution is to move from income to taxing spending.<p>The richest spend the smallest percentage of their income and therefore would be taxed the least percentage. I&#x27;m not sure what mental gymnastics you&#x27;re doing to make this make sense in your head but it doesn&#x27;t make sense anywhere else.<p>Also, income tax doesn&#x27;t dis-incentivize anything: there will always be an incentive to make more money. But a spending tax would dis-incentivize spending--which would be <i>terrible</i> for the economy. For someone who earlier was complaining that our tax system hurts the competitiveness of business, I&#x27;m not sure what makes you think a tax system that encourages dragon-like hoarding of wealth would hurt the competitiveness of business: it would, if anything, mean that people simply avoid doing business at all.<p>> We have had the technology for tens of years where we can send people assistance, pension, and medical payments. Hence the technology to refund a percentage below the tax threshold exists.<p>Okay, this could work, but why would we tax people just to refund them?<p>> The reason is simple, a single flat/fair/etc tax on all purchases and service buys removes a lot of power from government.<p>That&#x27;s true, but it moves that power squarely into the hands of large corporations that are <i>even less</i> answerable to the people who their actions affect. I don&#x27;t like governments any more than the next person, but I do like them more than giant corporations whose only morality is greed. At least a democratic republic has incentives to appear somewhat moral some of the time. Corporations have no such incentive.<p>> You got me when I earned it, how dare you take it from family just because you decide it was no longer ours once one person dies.<p>Ah yes, it&#x27;s really important that we keep the wealth in the hands of a few people who were born into it. We wouldn&#x27;t want to incentivize work, innovation, or progress, now would we!",1426021088

The head man replied that he had never seen bears that were any colour other than brown, but if a wise or truthful man came from the North Pole and told him that bears there were white, he might believe him. The scientific methods of hypothesising, classifying and making logical deductions were alien to him. </i><p>What? That head man of the Siberian tribe gave a darned excellent answer there.<p>There is nothing scientific about taking the premises for granted that bears are always white wherever there is always snow, and that there is always snow at the North Pole. Unless you empirically investigate these things for yourself, you take them on authority.  Deduction isn&#x27;t scientific; it&#x27;s just a way of rearranging logical statements to see their truth value in a different representation.<p>From the premises it can be deduced &quot;bears are white at the North Pole&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t make the premises true.<p>The Siberian simply didn&#x27;t recognize the academic context of being asked a question about logical deduction in order to demonstrate that he understands that <i>form</i>; he looked at it in a broad, real-world context relevant to himself and his position in that world.",1426020992

&quot;The cheetah has unusually low genetic variability. This is accompanied by a very low sperm count, motility, and deformed flagella.[14] Skin grafts between unrelated cheetahs illustrate the former point, in that there is no rejection of the donor skin. It is thought that the species went through a prolonged period of inbreeding following a genetic bottleneck during the last ice age. This suggests that genetic monomorphism did not prevent the cheetah from flourishing across two continents for thousands of years.[15]&quot;<p>Now - cheetahs are objectively less fit than they would have been without these population bottlenecks, but they&#x27;re fit enough that they have not been outcompeted.  They are probably highly vulnerable to contagion, though - maybe it&#x27;s only a matter of time before something figures out how to wipe them out... but maybe not.

You want old programmers when you have too much work to do. But when you have a slowdown and don&#x27;t need high-end work, those older programmers will be seen as (expensive) excess capacity.

There are a couple of ways to improve this technique, improve accuracy, reduce power, and improve noise rejection.<p>The biggest wins are in improving the waveform from this one (called &quot;continuous wave&quot; or CW in the radar/sonar literature) to one with more bandwidth. One option is to sweep the frequency continuously (FMCW) or with breaks. Another option is to switch from this continuous noise to pulses of noise, just turning the sound on and off. Pulsing like this increases bandwidth (because the &quot;turning on and off&quot; introduces higher-bandwidth edges) very simply. Modulating the frequency during the pulse helps more, creating a wolf-whistle like &quot;chirp&quot;.<p>Doing the signal processing for these alternative waveforms is a little bit trickier than the technique this page uses.

Of course there are also many studies since both supporting and refuting the theory.<p>A excerpt from a meta-analysis of the topic by Eagly, Ashore, Marhijani, Longo from 1991;<p><pre><code>  Whether physical attractiveness is more important to per-
  ceivers of one sex than the other is not entirely clear. In view of
  Feingold&#x27;s (1990a) meta-analysis showing that men place greater
  value  on  physical attractiveness  than  women do,  especially
  when romantic attraction  is considered, it is possible to argue
  that physical attractiveness could be a more powerful  dimen-
  sion  in  men&#x27;s than women&#x27;s implicit  theories  of personality.
  However, the research we review on the physical attractiveness
  stereotype was not carried out in the context of romantic rela-
  tionships. Moreover, the question addressed in research on the
  physical attractiveness stereotype pertains to the meaning in-
  ferred from attractiveness cues, not the importance of attractive-
  ness. Men and women may differ in the importance they ac-
  cord to attractiveness even though they infer similar meaning
  (e.g., social competence) from attractiveness cues. Particularly
  in  view  of evidence  that  the  content  of gender  stereotypes
  differs little for male and female subjects (e.g., Deaux & Lewis,
  1983,1984; Eagly & Steffen, 1984), we suspect that the physical
  attractiveness stereotype is widely shared in American culture
  and is therefore little affected by variation in subject character-
  istics, including subject sex.

  - You are presented a QR that you scan

  - The &quot;app&quot; asks you to sign into your bank.

  - The bank issues you a virtual card with your billing address details, but a one-time-PAN (credit card number), CVV and expiry.

  - There is a sub-account created that is the amount you are about to auth with the merchant. The merchant about to be doing the authorization is linked.

  - The &quot;app&quot; presents the merchant &quot;POS&quot; with the virtual card details

  - The merchant &quot;POS&quot; authorizes it using any gateway they happen to be using. Which in turn does the Brand-Net auth dance with the issuer.

  - On positive auth, the sub-account balance is transferred to the merchant (thanks, VisaNet!), and the OTP (one-time PAN) is tossed in the recycle bin.
</code></pre>
In any case, they don&#x27;t have to deal with 6,000 banks like we have in the US. That said, the US could probably do this easily enough in cooperation with FDC or Total Systems or both.<p>If the merchant doesn&#x27;t have the QR-code thing, you can still manually key-enter your one-time PAN virtual card details like you do today, knowing that you don&#x27;t care about the number past its use right now.<p>There are a lot of weird details about how it all works if some party or another isn&#x27;t an active full cooperating member of the system, but the idea is to:<p>1) Limit card number exposure<p>2) Get a user&#x27;s explicit pre-auth for a specific merchant, amount and date<p>3) Get the usability factor you are talking about<p>4) Leverage the existing bank card consumer protection rules already in place<p>Which is not to say that Bitcoin isn&#x27;t cool.

My feelings:<p>- I really like collaborative spaces/pods <i>except</i> when I&#x27;m trying to really hammer on work, independently. I don&#x27;t like being isolated. If I come into the office at 7-or-8am before everyone arrives, those two hours will outstrip the rest of my day (except after 6pm). Noise, mid-afternoon, is especially bad and distracting. Some people in my group have taken to occupying entire meeting rooms just so they can focus in quiet.<p>- I am most productive at University in quiet spaces. The library, mostly. BUT, in an environment where I&#x27;m working with other people, bouncing ideas, etc, it&#x27;s not a productive environment because libraries demand QUIET. My second favorite place to work is in one of our &quot;group study&quot; rooms. They&#x27;re small, private rooms with space for up to 6 people. Whiteboards and TVs, outlets, etc are provided.<p>I think separating people into these rooms would be my ideal configuration. I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;d necessarily partition people officially (except in cases where people want an office to e.g. store belongings), just give people a notebook and say sit where you want. I can therefore sit in whichever room I want, and multiple people who demand quiet working conditions are able to share a space. This combines the nicety of social interaction, being able to discuss with someone about work-or-non-work related things, with long stretches of quiet, uninterrupted worktime.<p>The ideal office (or at least one I&#x27;d like to try working in) would be where there are many offices small offices that represent these group study rooms. Natural light (with blinds), comfy chairs, TVs for presenting, whiteboards, climate control, etc. Take one room and copy/paste it. Add some open areas as well, for people who prefer to work in those spaces. Destress/common areas.",1426017894

Semi-structured data, full-text search, &quot;web scale&quot; programming, geographical indexes... all of these things, people say &quot;you can&#x27;t do in a relational database&quot; and that&#x27;s not true. Postgres is fucking powerful and can do a lot, very well.<p>Arguably, PostgreSQL isn&#x27;t always a &quot;relational database&quot;. You can <i>use</i> it as a key-value store.

The relational database seems to be an attractor; the requirements that accrue to a typical in-house &quot;we can do it better&quot;/NIH non-relational database often converge on it.<p>NoSQLs have their place at very large scale (100+ TB) and there are plenty of specialized reasons to use alternative databases-- I doubt that Postgres&#x27;s full-text search is competitive with Elasticsearch-- but I feel like most of the anti-SQL sentiment is against <i>the language</i>.

I am saying that in most applications your working dataset is much smaller than your total data set. So why pay for hardware capable of holding your entire dataset in RAM when you don&#x27;t need it?<p>I am surprised you are able to do this with Mongo. Last I checked, it simply did not handle this case, and started failing miserably if it was not able to fit all data into RAM.<p>Re: durability: I am not talking about the server going down, coming back up. I am talking about whether there is an fsync() when writing data. Set up a test case where you are writing data very rapidly to MongoDB, then pull the plug on the box it&#x27;s running on. It&#x27;ll come back up, but the data it told you it just wrote won&#x27;t be there because it didn&#x27;t checkpoint. Did you check that all your writes succeeded when you had node failures in your cluster? Most applications don&#x27;t have the machinery to do this because generally the state necessary to check this is stored in the database, yet it&#x27;s the database you are testing. The only way to test this is to also write logs (also atomically), and then verify DB data against logs. Or, just use a database that guarantees durability.<p>Re: consistency: MongoDB doesn&#x27;t support transactions [1]. That&#x27;s enough to exclude it from a large number of applications. Anything to do with money, for example, is out since you really don&#x27;t want double spending to be a thing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/write-operations-atomicity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/write-operations-atomici...</a>",1426017832

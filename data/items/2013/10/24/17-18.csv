6606748,comment,6600784,6603742,2,0,jayro,,,"Honestly, I can&#x27;t remember if I have, but it would be interesting to read something about it. I wonder if it&#x27;s kind of the same problem as trying to teach concepts to kids that are just at the limit of their ability to comprehend even if they are naturally gifted. It&#x27;s tough, man. My experience of trying to explain functions, arrays, loops and conditionals to young kids is tricky, but I think you just have to apply the same techniques as you would teaching math and eventually you&#x27;ll figure out some techniques that work. You can try breaking it down into the smallest of steps and go very slowly with lots of practice. Sometimes analogies help, but sometimes not. Sometimes, you can just show them a bunch of simple examples which they&#x27;ll be able to pattern match against until they can absorb it, but sometimes not. More than anything, I think you just have to be patient and experiment.<p>As an example, my daughter Izzy, who&#x27;s 7 and in second grade, is really struggling with her math and it&#x27;s pretty frustrating frankly. But my wife has been trying lots of stuff with her like watching Khan Academy videos, doing practice problems on www.ixl.com, working through Singapore and JUMP math workbooks, working with physical objects as examples - counting change, poker chips, or whatever.<p>The bottom line is that every kid is a little different and what works for some may not work for others, unfortunately. ;)<p>Edit: In regards to how to teach symbolic logic to children who may not be naturally talented, you might want to check out JUMP Math: <a href=""http://jumpmath.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jumpmath.org</a>. They seem to be doing some innovative things.

It will be more like the death of horse riding after the advent of the car. (If I want to go horse riding there is a club that offers that not five minutes from where I’m living. Horse riding is dead – but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible or even hard to go horse riding today.)

The likelihood of the user clicking on an organic listing is very small to zero.<p>While most major US corporations have been purchasing PPC ads for their own trademarks for many years, and sitelinks have existed in Adwords ads for a few ads allowing more navigation options, this particular screenshot shows much deeper results. What I see in that screenshot matches the organic listings for Southwest Airlines right now on Google, &quot;Check in Online&quot; etc. The &quot;sponsored&quot; label within this element makes me assume that Southwest is paying any of those clicks.<p>The marketing departments of these large corporations, being dependent on their own internal results to justify further budget increases and bonuses are easily pulled in to this traffic attribution trap. They will be able to say, bookings from Adwords PPC traffic increased X times, when these were bookings that they previously were getting <i>for free.</i><p>Figure out may be its not a great idea in two years? Too late. Google will just show something else in your place. (Google&#x27;s ITA software prohibition expires in 2016, which will effect a lot of travel sites and airlines but that is a different topic.)<p>Is Google within their rights to do this, in the US? More or less yes. However, these corporations are baking in <i>billions</i> of dollars in extra costs to themselves. If I buy a Facebook ad or a Superbowl ad I get new visibility. Should I have to pay Rand Mcnally for users who walk through the door of my Starbuck&#x27;s franchise because they used the map to find my location? It doesn&#x27;t sound so ludicrous if I used a smart phone app to find a local coffee shop.<p>There is another side to this, the user&#x27;s side. How happy are users once they know that most of what they are clicking on with Google are paid advertisements? For most of Google&#x27;s life ads were just supplemental, a little additional content that made the company boatloads of money. No, for certain terms all Google is is ads. Its wildly more profitable. When users have been trained for years to believe Google is offering them objectively ranked content it becomes even better because their brains believe that ad they just clicked on is actually an objectively chosen &quot;best&quot; answer. Is this sustainable in the long run?<p>I&#x27;m not 30 yet and I feel like an old fart. I don&#x27;t like the NSA reading my email. I don&#x27;t like Facebook logins following me around the web. I don&#x27;t appreciate perpetual history of every thing I do. I never even created a LinkedIn account. I don&#x27;t like the idea of my Google experience being a boatload of paid ads.

In your case, I would say the banner represents the giant logo over the door, just before you walk into the building.<p>In most ad-based marketing, you&#x27;re typically not just randomly throwing your brand out there. Obviously, the expected ROI goes up when you can target the right demographic (saturday morning cartoons versus world news with Tom Brokaw). This is not that. This isn&#x27;t a demographic-driven ad, based on search criteria like &quot;airline travel&quot; or &quot;buy tickets from DEN to DTW&quot;. The person knew exactly what they were searching for. Hell, depending on your browser, typing that exact string in your address bar will take you directly to Southwest Airlines.

The funny thing is that GPU makers have taken to <i>literally</i> just renaming and repackaging their old GPUs, e.g. the R9.[1] As for the game itself, there is a looming revolution in gaming when Carmack (or someone equally genius-y) really figures out how to coordinate multiple cores for gaming.[2]<p>But yeah, most everything else runs fine on machines from 2006 and on, including most development tasks.

I was sort-of waiting for the &quot;gee its time to upgrade&quot; mark to roll around in 3 or 4 years, but it hasn&#x27;t happened yet. Any games I want to play it still runs very well, and it still feels very fast to me even compared to modern off-the-shelf systems.<p>When my friends ask for laptop-buying advice I tell them if they like the keyboard and screen, then its <i>just plain hard</i> to be disappointed with anything new.<p>I think I can pinpoint when this happened - It was the SSD. Getting an SSD was the last upgrade I ever needed.<p>~~~<p>Above that, PCs aren&#x27;t necessary for a lot of people, because people do not need $2000 Facebook and email machines. For the median person, if you bought a PC in 2006, then got an iPad (as a gift or for yourself) and started using it a lot, you might find that you stopped turning on your PC. How could you justify the price of a new one then?<p>Yet if there was a major cultural shift to just tablets (which are great devices in their own right), I would be very worried. It&#x27;s hard(er) to create new content on a tablet, and I don&#x27;t really want that becoming the default computer for any generation.<p>I think its extremely healthy to have the lowest bar possible to go from &quot;Hey I like that&quot; to &quot;Can I do that? Can I make it myself?&quot;<p>I think its something hackers, especially those with children should ask themselves: Would I still be me, if I had grown up around primarily content consumption computing devices instead of more general purpose laptops and desktops?<p>Tablets are knocking the sales off of low-end PCs, but we as a society <i>need</i> the cheap PC to remain viable, if we want to turn as many children as possible into creators, engineers, tinkerers, and hackers.",1382637072

That unminified version is usually the product of a script that concatenates other, smaller scripts.  This leads to a perceived high level of duplication (because, after all, they are the same functions and code).  For whatever reason, even in private mode, the exclude patterns are not followed.<p>Also, the linter is much more aggressive than jshint/jslint (in many cases, for no good reason).  For example, in a function whose sole purpose is to do bit twiddling (interpreting a set of bytes as an IEEE 754 double), the linter complains `Unexpected use of &#x27;&&#x27;`.  (the original line was `c3 = (e3 & 3) << 6 | e4;`).  Akin to JSHint flags, there should be flags to control the linter.",1382635877

Obviously, no one is going to create an exact copy of Harry Potter or Microsoft Flight Simulator without having seen the original, but they might very well write a wizard school story or plane-based video game; clearly, those concepts do not deserve to be owned.<p>Anything not specific enough to be covered by copyright is capable of being duplicated by another human independently, and therefore absurd and counterproductive to assign ownership and monopoly rights.",1382635816

Especially as x86 processors start taking over arm processors.<p>Just because it doesn&#x27;t sit in a big box doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a different class of system. The difference is really the openness of the platform, comparing something like iOS to Win 8 pro.<p>That said, many tablets are basically what we would have thought of as PCs before.  Consider something like the Samsung 500T or similar, or thinkpad helix.  Components are small and cheap enough that they can be packed behind the LCD, and you have essentially a laptop that doesn&#x27;t need it&#x27;s keyboard.<p>Will iPads take over PCs? No. They are too limited, not because of hardware, but because of OS limitations.  Will tablets take their place though? Quite possibly. The portability is quite handy.  That I can dock a tablet with a keyboard and have a normal PC experience, but have it portable when I need it is a selling feature.<p>The obvious cavaet is that a limited OS is fine as long as the majority of data is cloud based.  In that case even development can be done on a closed platform, and the tablet becomes something more akin to a monitor or keyboard.  More of a peripheral than a computing device.

The main advantage is the transaction system, rather than the store of value.<p>The transaction speed isn&#x27;t really much of an issue as long as the block reward is much higher than the value of your transaction. For most modest transactions, like food and consumer goods, just seeing the transaction come across the network is good enough. It&#x27;s possible to beat this, but doing so requires a large enough effort that nobody would bother doing it to get lunch when they could be getting dozens of block rewards worth thousands of times more instead.

And of course, a number of logical volumes on which the files are &quot;located&quot;. Where a directory structure is actually needed, files could have special names, like &quot;/os/glad/file_42&quot; (that&#x27;s a <i>name</i>, not a path).<p>A variation on this theme would be to do away with explicit names altogether, and only use tags.  The &quot;name&quot; of the file would just need to be reasonably unique.  That one is probably best.<p>Now, when you search for a file, you just query for tags. Can also be done through the shell: it&#x27;s just that those two commands would have the exact same effect:<p><pre><code>  cd /foo/bar\n  cd /bar/foo\n</code></pre>\nAs for the volume, you need them to transfer files between your USB key and your computer.<p>Oh, thinking of using cryptographic hashes to name files  When you modify the file, the ID changes as well that&#x27;s a \n<i>new</i> file!

Exchange rates are important for BTC&#x27;s legal users <i>now</i> because there&#x27;s not (yet) production in BitCoin&#x27;s economy. Apart from drugs[1], BTC is pure store of value, and it should be analyzed as such.<p>This is important for this discussion, because exchange rates ultimately won&#x27;t matter that much. By &quot;ultimately&quot;, I mean that phase of development when (if) BitCoin becomes a full currency, that is, when there&#x27;s somebody, some corporation, operating and trading significantly in the currency. <i>I won&#x27;t lend the status of currency to any commodity which is not used this way</i>.<p>And what&#x27;s clear is that both BitCoin and gold are shit currencies. Even conceding the exchange rate could stabilize enough for a modern day Rockefeller[2] to pull it to a success, you still would have to contend with the deflation inherent in this &quot;currency&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why gold is traded in <i>commodities</i> markets -- and not as a currency. There&#x27;s a reason why banks and states trade and store USD, instead of gold. You simply can&#x27;t grow an economy like it&#x27;s the 20th century with gold, or BitCoin. In fact, BitCoin is even more ruthless than gold. 19th century economies could at least pray for the discovery of a gold vein, to alleviate their deflationary comedowns. BitCoin denies even this possibility with the cold, germanic efficiency of a mathematical proof.<p>[0] The exchange rate we run against our future selves, if you will.<p>[1] Which doesn&#x27;t count anyhow, since you would agree there&#x27;s a risk markup on them for their illegal status, which makes dubious extrapolating any analysis from them.<p>[2] An improbably apt group of entrepreneurs, who even more improbably would decide to bet their future fortunes on a currency designed by <i>computer</i> geeks with a penchant for goldbuggering.",1382634398

(69,000,000 / 34,000 = 2029.4)<p>I don&#x27;t know exactly what the workforce looks like, but it&#x27;s probably something like 4 cashiers, 2 cooks,  2 helpers, and a manager.  If we assume we don&#x27;t need to pay the manager more then that&#x27;s 8 employees per store that we want to have a higher pay.<p>The big mac value meal is $5.69. Let&#x27;s say the average customer buys that. [2]<p>2000 customers per day * $5.69 = $11,380 in revenue in a day.

Is there any real impact on anybody but their employees?<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s an error in those calculations somewhere, but the general idea is that it doesn&#x27;t take much of a price increase to cover the pay for employees.[4] This is what drives me crazy about these companies.

I saved a ton of money by getting an AMD FX-8350 (I already had an AMD motherboard on hand, so that helped too), and although it does bottleneck in really CPU-intensive games, I can run almost all games on the highest settings at 2560x1440. The graphics card is really the only component that you need to splurge on for a gaming rig these days, because it&#x27;s the bottleneck for the vast majority of games.",1382634091

It could use more RAM and an SSD (maybe), but for 99% of what I do, including gaming, it&#x27;s plenty fast enough. I can&#x27;t run the very absolute latest AAA games on highest, but if I turn the resolution down a hair or turn off antialiasing they run fine.<p>In fact the only thing I really want a faster machine for is some of the latest emulation techniques (Higan) and a vague desire to play around with some virtualization odds and ends.",1382634077

6606404,comment,6606056,6606056,2,0,mortenjorck,,,"Five years ago, I bought a MacBook Pro to replace my PowerBook G4, which was itself five years old. The list of obsolescences was enormous: It had only USB 1.1 in a market teeming with new USB 2.0 hardware that couldn&#x27;t have existed with the slower speeds; it had a <i>single-touch</i> trackpad just as OS X was introducing all sorts of useful multi-touch gestures; it relied on clumsy external solutions for wi-fi and Bluetooth; it had a slow-to-warm CFL LCD that had been supplanted by bright new LED backlit screens; it was even built on a dead-end CPU architecture that Apple had traded for vastly more powerful, energy-efficient, multi-core x86 processors.<p>Today, the calendar says it&#x27;s time for me to upgrade again. Yet the pain of obsolescence of a five-year-old laptop in 2013 just isn&#x27;t the same as in 2008: USB 3.0? What new applications is it enabling? Anything I need Thunderbolt for? Not yet. New Intel architectures and SSDs at least promise less waiting in everyday use... but I&#x27;m hardly unproductive with my old machine.",1382634060

They told us they wanted to pay a la carte, but when we tested it they very much did not.<p>I think the psychology makes sense. When they told us they wanted to pay on a pay per use basis they based that completely on the past. They did the basic math. Last month I did 16 tickets. At $.25 a piece I would have paid $4! <i>That&#x27;s</i> what I want to pay!<p>When faced with a future purchase decision, however, the mindset immediately changed. Now the decision was unbound. What if in three months I get to the point I have 1,000 tickets?!??! My god, now it&#x27;s $250/month. That&#x27;s crazy expensive! That fear caused a lot of issues.<p>So we tried the logical next step. $.25 per use, capped at a certain dollar amount ($25/month). That was too complicated to understand.<p>So we just started charging a flat $25/month (sales-leads fwiw). That worked really well.",1382634032

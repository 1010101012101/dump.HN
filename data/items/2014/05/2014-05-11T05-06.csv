7727931,comment,7726115,7726115,4,0,deathanatos,,,"> Anyway, I have this Sparcstation ELC which I bought for my personal use in a moment of stupidity. It has a 760MB hard disk and 16MB of memory. I figured that 16MB ought to be enough, and indeed, pstat reports that on a typical day, running Ecch Windows, a few Emacses, xterms, and the occasional xload or xclock, I run 12 to\n13MB of memory usage, tops.<p>> But I didn’t come here today to talk about why 2 emacses and a window system should take five times the total memory of the late AIKS-10. No, today I came to talk about the virtual memory system.<p>> Why is it that when I walk away from my trusty jerkstation for a while and come back, I touch the mouse and all of a sudden, whirr, rattle, rattle, whirr, all my processes get swapped back into memory?<p>> I mean, why did they get paged out in the first place? It’s not like the system needed that memory—for chrissake, it still has 3 or 4 MB free!<p>That&#x27;s another quoted email in the Handbook, from a Robert E. Seastrom, dated 1993! I was wondering the same thoughts myself — <i>fifteen years later</i> — about Windows Vista, and it later became one of the wonderful things about switching to Linux, which does not page unless is must (though this behavior is configurable).<p>(That said, when Linux runs out of memory, it can go on a Sisyphus-esque page-a-thon and die thrashing the disk about the interior of the machine casing. For all people complain about the OOM killer, sometimes, it&#x27;s handy!)",1399787869

7727883,comment,7726615,7727744,2,0,saurik,,,"A video has a minimum viable rate (past which point it will no longer be real time), while a web page only sort of does. A video is a sustained download, while a web page is relatively instantaneous. If a thousand people are clicking links and browsing web pages even fairly quickly, they will likely not notice each other&#x27;s usage of the network. The same cannot be said of a thousand people streaming a video over the same network.<p>To model this another way: you are muddling together the capacity of something with its speed. These are highly related ideas, as past the latency of a link the bandwidth does manage to model the speed a single user can obtain over the connection. However, users are sharing that speed over a specific duration: it absolutely matters how much data is being transferred. The web page is simply fewer bits than a video, so more of them can be downloaded over the same capacity link per unit time.<p>To make that time requirement more concrete: a thousand people who need to download a minute of video within the next minute requires more capacity than a thousand people downloading a minute of video who are willing to wait up to two minutes to watch it, both of which require more bandwidth than a thousand people downloading a minute of video who just need it to arrive before tomorrow.<p>(Putting this all together, you hopefully see how flow control becomes relevant: peak load is informed by peak capacity, which causes the speed per user to automatically slow down as the bandwidth capacity is reached. But this is more of an advanced thought that is probably not needed to appreciate that a thousand people streaming video need larger pipes than a thousand people working at some email: that is hopefully intuitive.)",1399786437

If I tag an outbound message, and someone replies to it, can I easily read back the tag from the reply message?<p>Put another way--I want to send an outbound email in relation to a specific thread/ID, and if someone replies I want to associate their reply with that ID.  What's the best way to do this with your system?",1305356327

Increased sharing is preventing as much work from getting re-done, which is fine because people want more programs than can be supplied by the capable.  Nobody looks at garbage collection, one of the biggest programmer-time-savers (and hence eliminators) invented in our art and says ""man, they're taking our jerbs.""<p>So perhaps while not disproving your general point, this kind of thing has been going on for a very long time.<p>Things will be peachy as long as engineering is a growth industry.

Let me explain where I think you went wrong.<p>You claimed (at least certainly implied) that this was not a worthwhile idea because health insurance isn't really necessary or is not for the majority of people; which one you meant wasn't totally clear. Either way: kids and women comprise a lot of the US population. Kids need health insurance. Women, also, usually need health insurance if they are sexually active (though this isn't always true).<p>Genetic diseases, mental disorders, accidents, etc. Lots of reasons to have health insurance.<p>Next point: Health insurance is complicated. It shouldn't be. When I left my job, finding individual health insurance was incredibly painful, and I have excellent credit and no predisposition to disease (and no existing ones). I can't even imagine how hard it would be if either of those weren't true.<p>So I think you went wrong in that you were short-sighted; just because it doesn't apply to _you_ doesn't mean it isn't a worthwhile or useful idea.<p>Lots of people can't drive, but somehow the rental car business is still booming.",1305354335

2547250,comment,2546815,2547029,5,0,rryan,,,"I thought one of the goals was for it to be fully decentralized. If I'm relying on a nameserver I trust (let's say ICANN starts running their own .bit mirror) then what's to stop ICANN from making edits to whatever they serve up as per what the US government forces them to do? If ICANN adds their .bit TLD mirror to the root servers then we're back at square 1 because most people will consume .bit through the roots. In order to deliver on the promise of decentralization it seems every client must have its own copy by default instead of relying on a trusted authority. I think that doesn't scale very well, though.<p>Side note: my understanding of bitcoin is that a given bitcoin network requires a central IRC server for command/control of miners.

2547244,comment,2546565,2546565,2,0,illumen,,,"The old 3d driver model relied on trust.  If you ran a 3d program, you have probably installed it and you trust it.<p>3d program writers spend a lot of time fixing bugs to try and make sure their program does not crash users machines.  I've been writing 3d code for over 15 years now, and have yet seen a machine that I don't accidentally crash whilst writing code against it.<p>This has all now changed.  WebGL allows anyone to access a much greater section of the 3d hardware than before.  The 3d driver writers have not accounted for this in writing their software.<p>Good for 3d drivers, because now there will be much wider testing with more easily repeatable bug reports.  Since it is such a nice attack vector, we should also see more 3rd party testing.  Also, this can only increase the amount of people using 3d - so driver writers will definitely need to spend more work on making their code safer against evil input.<p>I don't think it is as bad with WebGL compared to what you can do with opengl.  There's less pointer passing of shared memory regions.  Also, all the browsers have black lists for 3d hardware/OS versions already.  So if a particular card/driver combination is found to be buggy, they can black list it easily for all users.<p>tl;dr it definitely is unsafe, but the sky isn't necessarily falling... yet.",1305353304

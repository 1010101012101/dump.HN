1806158,comment,1805922,1805922,0,0,photon_off,,,"I spent probably 6 months to an entire year working on failed or unreleased projects.  Some were just little things to learn the language, like a trojan written in VB6 that would do various annoying to the user (like ""earthquake"" their windows), to a couple of sites I've recently launched that are currently too complicated and/or just not valuable to anybody except me.  My outlook at this point is admittedly pessimistic.<p>Lessons learned, in no particular order, except for the last:<p>- If you need to explain your app to customers in more than one sentence, or if that sentence contains any four-or-more syllable words, or if any of those words' definitions fail the above two criteria, it will probably fail.<p>- If you are working on a project to scratch your own itch, confirm that other people have a rash.<p>- Do not give in to feature creep, unless that feature presents itself immediately and without intervention.  For example:  Back-end features to improve search results:  good.  Sliders, filters, color coding, additional search options, menus, extra words, animations, hover effects, etc, will probably only confuse people, unless you are a UX genius, in which case those features will merely go unused.<p>- People trust their gut instinct on what something does, rather than read instructions, or discover, or wander into unfamiliar territory.  Find the design for your product that mimics something people have used to solve a similar problem.<p>- People are generally incapable of abstraction.  If you are the ""x of y"", that means people need to thoroughly understand x, y, and what it means to abstract one to the other.<p>- People will exert very little effort into learning something unless the rewards are immediate, have been stated to them by a trusted source, or are made extremely enticing.<p>- Ideas that require a critical mass of users to be useful are easy to come by, nearly impossible to execute.<p>- Hope for the best, expect failure.<p>- Stay the fuck away from anything ""meta,"" or anything involving variables.  People like being served things that they pick from a menu, or that people suggest.  The most complicated task the average person has to deal with, on any regular basis, is probably choosing multiple toppings for a pizza.<p>- It is far better to release a crappy implementation of something awesome than it is to release an awesome implementation of something crappy.  Awesomeness in the idea is easier and more valuable than awesomeness in the implementation.<p>- Presentation is much more important than you'd like to believe.<p>- It is far better to be lucky than any of the above.  Yes, you can slightly increase your chances of being ""lucky,"" but don't kid yourself.",1287460735

I absolutely think it would be awesome if you could go through your grades at your own pace, in different subjects.  A software based approach to learning would be excellent for this.<p>But of course this is completely antithetical to his latter point, which is that group based learning/problem-solving is important.  You can't have groups if everyone is going at their own pace.<p>The happy medium might be to structure elementary education more like college, with the ability to take 100 level classes in the 4th year or whatnot.  But of course, this is far more expensive than the batch method because you have to have many more classes.  To support so many classes you have to have many more children, which means vastly larger schools, so you might only be able to do it in densely populated cities.",1287460466

How many people are ready and willing to be police officers at some level of pay, and how many police officers are needed?<p>Policing isn't trivial, but you know what? Neither are most other jobs. There are many, many people with the capability of being police officers; supply is high. Demand is not actually all that high compared to supply. There's even more supply than may initially meet the eye because many people not physically strong enough to be police officers right this instant could bring themselves up to spec if needed. The difficulty or unpleasantness of the job factors into the supply but I think you'd find a lot of people who would take that job; it's hard, but there's a lot of hard jobs about that people do for much less than that amount of money.

Governments aren't immune to this. They must run at a net profit or they'll bring their society down. Measurement of profit is somewhat different than a private company, but profit they must; they must be extracting more value from their employees than they are paying their employees or the society is running the government at a net loss, which can only be tolerated to a finite degree as determined by what other surpluses the society is running elsewhere.

This is not a new market, and there are a ton of free options that allow really large downloads (FileFactory, etc.).<p>I think the only way you'd make headway is to focus on customer service and presentation:<p>- Provide a way to directly download the file via link vs. having to visit a page first.<p>- Be very specific about the amount of time the file will be hosted, and tell the customer that you will contact them at the email address provided to remind them prior to expiry that it will expire. There will also be a defined period of time following expiry when the file would stay there until payment was made to extend the contract before the file was removed.<p>- Be clear about how you store the files (using some well-known enterprise provider, or describe the fault tolerance enough where people feel safe).<p>- Site must look very legit so that customers will really believe that you will take care of them.<p>- Limited downloads or time limit is not something people are looking for. I think the companies that did rate limiting slow downloads that require customers to buy faster download had a better model, even though I never bought one. However, you can't do this and handle the first requirement of direct URL to download, so maybe you could offer both; if the customer wanting you to host the download wants a direct URL, they can pay you for that on subscription basis, in which case their customers would not have to wait on the download; otherwise, the customer downloading the file has to pay subscription for a faster download.<p>Realistically though you can't compete with larger companies doing massive storage.

Why expose things like passwordless keys and make it easier to be compromised?  One machine that exposes inbound rsync to transfer files is more secure than a cluster of machines that allow passwordless key inbound ssh.  ssh is also harder (more error prone) to secure for limiting commands that can be run or only allowing file transfers.  When you configure rsyncd, you already <i>know</i> it's only supposed to allow file transfers, so it's straightforward to audit.  ssh has many more capabilities thus making auditing more difficult.  The security of the files themselves are already not an issue because they are distributed to the entire cluster, so transferring them over ssh doesn't gain any security advantage.<p>As for it being directed at you, this has occurred more than once in our environment, I suspect because something/someone set a precedent early on.  If this is a serious problem depends on the environment.  These are the things that keep systems people up at night.

So I&#x27;ll give a <i>very oversimplified</i> set of calculations below. The details can be nitpicked ad nauseum, but this is essentially Feynman-style estimation, so please see the forest and not just the trees.<p>First, some facts:<p>According to the BLS, the lowest quintile of Americans spent $12,955 on goods and services in 2014 [1].<p>The US adult population in 2014 is about 242.5 million people [2].<p>So if we wanted to provide a guaranteed unconditional income equal to the average yearly expenditures of the bottom quintile of Americans, the cost would total about 3.14 trillion dollars.<p>Total U.S. tax revenue in 2014 was 3.2 trillion dollars [3].<p>So a basic income program that merely provides poverty-level income for all Americans is going to cost all of our current federal tax revenue, and we are already running a federal defecit.<p>This is plainly not feasible without vastly increasing tax revenue.<p>You could argue that state and local revenue could pick up the slack, but states and municipalities are generally under severe budgetary pressures as well and have even less power to raise additional revenue. Even if all tax revenue in the US from any source is considered accessible for a basic income program, that pile of money is only about $6 trillion, so a poverty-level basic income program is going to consume half of all tax revenue collected from any source in the US.<p>All of this is an <i>optimistic</i> calculation. It doesn&#x27;t account for the contraction of the economy (and thus tax revenue) that would occur due to people ceasing part time work or other low paying jobs. Or the increasing amount of federal revenue directed to servicing our national debt [4], which will make any basic income system increasingly unaffordable in the future (absent corresponding economic growth). You could alleviate some of that economic contraction by taxing the basic income itself (possibly conditionally, based on economic circumstances), but then you are providing a post-tax basic income that doesn&#x27;t even meet the poverty level.<p>The fact is that the demographics of the United States simply prohibit any meaningful basic income system from working at the present time. It simply won&#x27;t work without increasing tax revenues to levels that will destroy the economy. And this is ignoring the political obstacles that would have to be overcome (such as placing most of the additional tax burden on the 1%).<p>Our existing welfare systems, inefficient and bloated as they are, at least attempt to target those who are most at need. If you try to make a basic income system that essentially replaces existing welfare programs by taxing most of the basic income back from people who exceed certain economic threshholds, you are doing little more than inefficiently adjusting tax brackets.<p>It&#x27;s a nice dream, but somebody has to pay for it and right now nobody can.<p>[1] ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/ce/standard/2008/quintile.txt<p>[2] <a href=""http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/99-total-population-by-child-and-adult#detailed/1/any/false/36,868,867,133,38/39,40,41/416,417"" rel=""nofollow"">http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/99-total-populat...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/fed_revenue_2014US"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/fed_revenue_2014US</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GT738_ristid_G_20150203110744.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GT738_ristid_G_...</a>",1422997167

I visited the place on a weekday in 2002, when almost nobody went there unless they were really into crypto history.  It was run down, and there were only about 10 people visiting that day. The tour guide was more into the architecture of the mansion than the crypto, although they had a bombe model (a prop made for a 2001 movie) and had started on the Colossus rebuild. The only thing that worked back then was one Enigma machine. A non-working Lorenz machine and some other gear was in glass cases. The guide pointed out where various of the huts had been.  It was just one of those obscure, slightly run down historical spots one visits in England, with the usual lake and swans.<p>Then they got National Lottery funding.

Here we have a business that for all the reasons you point out is a <i>marginal</i> business, and this price shock pushed it over the edge.<p>It should be somewhat tautologically obvious that the businesses who have the hardest time absorbing a price shock like the minimum wage are the ones that are struggling already. This can be ignored with regard to large-scale industrial policy only if you feel there is no value in marginal industries.

8993124,comment,8991866,8992266,0,0,jgon,,,"What you can do to truly contribute to making Basic Income happen is to actually get yourself ready to support it. I&#x27;ll explain what I mean by this.<p>I think that a lot of people hear Basic Income, and if they have some form of compassion for their fellow man and an awareness of computers currently allow and where they are headed, they understand that pretty soon we&#x27;ll have to figure out a way of living in which a large portion of the population, or at least a large enough amount to comprise a real threat to social stability, will be unemployable. Completely.  There will be no job that actually contributes to moving our society forward that either a machine or another person with greater abilities will not be better suited for.  There will literally be no place in the economy for them to contribute.<p>So what do we do with these people?  Well we say that they get a Basic Income, enough money to live, and not just survive, but live. We&#x27;re not going to be able to consign a hundred million people to lives of depredation, so Basic Income is going to have to cover the basics and some of the stuff that makes life good.<p>In a lot of these discussions there are examples of the money currently spent on the welfare bureaucracy and how all that money can be rolled into BI, and I think that a lot of people stop listening there, convincing themselves that we&#x27;ll be able to create a BI, provide for people who can no longer work, and nothing in their lives will have to change. And my gut tells me that this is dead wrong.<p>So what can you do to contribute to making BI happen? Well you can realize that taking care of those people is not going to be free. You can start making yourself comfortable with the idea that taxes will have to go up.  Definitely on the ultra rich and the very rich, but also on us programmers, sitting here on HN and complaining about making 180k a year because San Francisco. BI is going to mean that the people we put out of work get taken care of, but its also going to mean that you&#x27;ll be driving a camry and not a tesla. Because we are the top 5%, and even if the 1% and the 0.1% are definitely going to have to be taxed way way more, we are going to have to do our part for the 95% below us. You&#x27;ve got to square yourself with the possibility that having a job will be something that very few people get, and that you will not be rewarded with incredible riches for doing so.  BI will probably bring a bunch of us a lot closer together, and hey if we&#x27;re lucky it might even be awesome Star Trek style.<p>But to get there we&#x27;re going to have to sacrifice to take care of our fellow man, and it won&#x27;t all just magically take care of itself. If you start preparing for this now, hopefully you won&#x27;t be like so many of the baby boomers I see, my parents and their friends included, who pay lip service to taking care of their fellow man, but whose actions in the voting booth betray these principles, as they just can&#x27;t bring themselves to make even a small sacrifice in their current living condition. That&#x27;s what I try to work on every day, making sure that I am not so addicted to my lifestyle and material goods that when BI and a 90% marginal top tax rate are on the ballot, I don&#x27;t blink and find myself voting for the man who promises &quot;tax cuts and forget about the other guy&quot;.<p>That, I think, is the biggest thing you can do to make BI happen.",1422995386

8993118,comment,8992281,8992281,0,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"I think the <i>types</i> of problems each programmer tends to confront make up a large part of the disconnect between the ones who &quot;drink the koolaid&quot; of a programming paradigm or process and the people who are unimpressed.<p>I typically do games. Games are useful to think, in part, in OOP terms; there is very little &quot;data flow&quot; and (typically) there are a lot of objects that need to interact in asynchronous ways. There are specific parts that could be reduced to flow based programming (FBP), but it seems like the wrong paradigm for writing an <i>entire</i> game, as an example close to me. I could imagine FBP certain AI logic state machines being useful, for instance.<p>But other areas of development have flow-style tools and that&#x27;s clearly the <i>right</i> way to write code. Signal processing is an obvious example: When you want to send an audio signal through a reverb, split it to two different types of processors and re-merge it later with a fader tied to an external control, laying those components out with boxes is 1000x better than trying to write code in text to do the same thing.<p>So I think articles like this are useful to introduce everyone to various other paradigms, in case they might be applicable to a problem that you&#x27;re working on. But it&#x27;s never a &quot;silver bullet&quot; simply because each tool works best in certain problem domains. A friend tried to convince me that I should drink the functional programming koolaid, for instance, but on drilling deeper I found that he had never worked on a game, and didn&#x27;t really grok what <i>kinds</i> of code you would normally end up putting in a game.<p>What I&#x27;d <i>love</i> to see is an article that compared a lot of different processes and paradigms and talked about <i>where</i> each is most useful. Especially if that article surprised me. :)<p>Problem is that most people are familiar with their own areas and toolsets; we&#x27;d probably need a team of people from different specialties to collaborate on it. Maybe a wiki where people could add in their experiences trying each approach or tool on their own problem domains? Then when someone <i>does</i> use functional programming to write a game, they could talk about the pros and cons and the kind of game they wrote. And <i>that</i> would be useful data.",1422995358

Not enough to be particularly interesting even then, yet alone now, and I haven&#x27;t spoken to him since he went to jail for the first time (I think around 2005).<p>I hugely admire his morals, and that he lives his life by them so completely. And I agree with a lot of them. But, at least from the vague impression I have based off old (and no-doubt memory-distorted) conversations with him, mainly on IRC, and on news reports in the last couple of years, I&#x27;m not too sure &quot;possible terrorist&quot; isn&#x27;t a fitting label for him. He&#x27;s always wanted to fight against big chunks of society.<p>As far as I know he&#x27;s never committed or planned to commit any violent crime, but his personality and view of the world make me think that he&#x27;d be willing to if he thought there was a greater good to come from it. The first thing he was caught and locked up for was stealing 1000s of credit cards from a right-wing website and using them - if I remember correctly, to donate to a charity. Those people who suffered at the hands of his credit card fraud were people he didn&#x27;t know, but was willing to justify it morally in that they had donated or purchased something from this right wing website. And yes it was a very right-wing site, it was very much within the norms of the American political spectrum, it&#x27;s not like they were neo-nazis or the KKK.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m doing him a disservice, and maybe the FBI were just abusing terrorism laws to crack down on (relatively-)innocent hackers. But the truth is that if I were in their shoes, Jeremy Hammond would scare me as much as the next plane from Al-Queda.<p>(And while on the subject of surveillance... I created a fake account from Tor to write this. Can&#x27;t imagine anyone would really care about my saying I knew him, hell I&#x27;m 99% sure he wouldn&#x27;t even remember my name, but I&#x27;d rather not make that tie if it hasn&#x27;t already been made.)",1422995348

Surely he understands U3 and U6, etc.  He may have partisan leanings to the extent that this can be taken as a criticism of the current administration.  Current policies may not be helping but I&#x27;m not sure that any partisan solutions provide the answers needed.<p>The bigger picture here is that the US sacrificed some broad-based increase in prosperity over the last 20+ years while helping the developing world to climb out of true poverty.  You cannot bring 1 billion Chinese (and to a lesser extent other peoples) into the &quot;middle class&quot; through trade while at the same time sustaining the exceptionally high standard of living of so many Americans -- at least not without some major, hopefully-temporary dislocations.<p>At the same time, somewhat related to this, we are witnessing the passing of a period in which America enjoyed unique competitive advantages which are unlikely to re-occur in a similar form.  No amount of IT innovation can make up for the passing of peak-US-cheap-oil-production (1970s), or the loss or diminishing of the dollar&#x27;s reserve status and the US&#x27;s central role in global trade (ongoing), or the temporary advantage of economic competitors being crushed in WWII (50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s)...<p>The Americans worst affected by these policies were bought off to some extent with cheap imported consumer goods (think Walmart), oodles of credit, the spread of two income households and of course benefit programs.<p>Now, if you were to try to address this problem sincerely from a position that jobs and employment are desirable social goods you wish to maximize, you might aim for sensible policies that would reduce the cost of living for typical Americans (allowing them to attain desirable, economically justifiable employment at globally competitive wages), increase labor mobility (ability to move for opportunity), and reduce the barriers to employment at the bottom of the employment ladder.  Secondary policy objectives might include simplifying the tax system, encouraging household formation, and restructuring education so that expensive college degrees are less necessary.<p>A lot of this has to do with how people are living in what kind of housing, how that housing is financed and what kind of transport they use to get to work and what kind of shape they are in mentally, physically and perhaps even spiritually to be be productive.  I think major changes are needed to achieve broad-based 21st century prosperity growth in the US.  Some of these changes would be deeply unpalatable and will only be considered if economic conditions worsen substantially.<p>Some here seem to think we are entering a post-employment society where jobs will be increasingly scarce because they are not needed and that this is a good thing.  Maybe it is, maybe it isn&#x27;t.  This kind of thing is the hallmark of privileged bubble thinking.

Similarly I didn&#x27;t see obvious, baked-in solutions to validation, or sharing templates between &quot;edit&quot; and &quot;create&quot; situations.<p>Then, there&#x27;s the built-in Meteor accounts stuff, which does not make it easy to create an admin page for users, which again I expected to be a straightfoward task. And, not only that, but once you do start to build that you read more-and-more about how allowing the client to make certain modifications is insecure, and so you should start pushing things back to Meteor methods...<p>Anyway, a lot of this stuff has given me pause.  I love the runtime speed, but the speed of getting something up and running (in terms of dev time) seems considerably slower than the equivalent in Rails, particularly around basic CRUD operations that you just need to get out of the way before you can build the more interesting stuff.",1422994951

It&#x27;s more targeted than U6 (which is a catchall for &quot;people who are not currently employed or underemployed and might or might not be looking for work&quot;). It&#x27;s the same reason the wonks tack on &quot;seasonally adjusted non-farmworkers&quot; when talking about these figures -- those terms mean relevant things and fundamentally change the population of workers you are talking about.\nDo the &quot;normal&quot; people concern themselves with the intricate details of Fed monetary policy, growth and yield details of equities, bond yeilds and their effects, foreign policy beyond the large military conflicts that the US is currently involved in? Nope.  Why should they know the difference between &quot;U3 unemployment&quot; and &quot;U6 unemployment&quot; if they don&#x27;t bother to learn?\nI agree with higher-raked comments that the U3 unemployment numbers are useful if (1) you consistently use U3 in all reporting (don&#x27;t jump from U3 to U6 to other metrics), you talk about trends and not the absolute number, and you describe which one you are using and what the caveats are of using that number.\nFor reference, the Wikipedia graph of U3 - U6:\n<a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/US_Unemployment_measures.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/US_Unemp...</a>\nU3 and U6 track very well with each other.  There are permanently structurally &quot;unemployed&quot;/&quot;underemployed&quot; people in the country. It doesn&#x27;t seem to budge much, whereas the U3/U6 numbers do seem to change over time. This shows that U3 is a decent trend predictor of U6, suggesting that there is little difference between U3 and U6 when talking about trends.\nAlso note that U3 data goes back MUCH further in time, which is another suggestion that it is a long-standing convention and not &quot;sleight of hand&quot;.",1422994913

In addition, changing a team&#x27;s process inside, Scrum indirectly completely changes how the team interacts with up- and downstream teams/components - in particular on practice eliminating any chance for early integration and for any iterations of the integrations.<p>That became obvious to me during the first day at the first Scrum course, especially after i tried to ask those questions to the teaching Scrum expert from the consulting company and received blank face with some blabbing in response.

We actually have great time right now at our BigCo. as after the Scrum fiasco, and quietly dropping the Scrum company-wide as the result, the management still seems to be kind of &quot;in shock&quot;, and they haven&#x27;t brought up any new fad in the process improvement so far, so we&#x27;re just doing typical old-fashioned per-feature waterfall, and it just works as usual - which is huge achievement compare to Scrum :)",1422994620

More skill than playing the game as it was intended to be played, in a lot of cases. The current Ocarina of Time route involves exploiting several glitches that require pressing the correct button combination on a specific frame (N64 games run at 20fps), jumping at just the pixel perfect angle to slide through a model&#x27;s corner/collision tracking, etc. Much more difficult stuff than beating the game straight through. Super Monkey Ball 2 (Gamecube game) speedruns require pulling off maneuvers trickier than anything the levels were explicitly designed for, the difficulty of which is hard to overstate. That game is hard. Speedrunning a game with true RNG everywhere like Nethack is definitely a beast of its own since you can&#x27;t memorize routes, but even runs with completely static routes are incredibly difficult to pull off.",1422994576

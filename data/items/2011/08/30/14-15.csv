I might use Git, an iMac, and Ruby... but I'd never try to change someones tech just because I prefer a different solution to the one they have in place and might have fully researched beforehand.<p>I agree with you deep down... I dislike SVN deeply (and I have to use it everyday), but you haven't even used it enough to be able to give an informed opinion on it. Just like Apple fanboys try to evangelize people because ""Windows sucks and Macs are so much cooler and Steve Jobs says so""<p>BTW, the biggest irony in my opinion, is that you're using Windows, which if you added Visual Studio to it (yes I know you're a pythonista, not the point) would mean that SVN is the [sic] BESTEST solution for your source control needs. Which is also a prime example that the latest technology is not always the best, and that you should always make this decisions on a case by case basis.<p>Also, I'm working on a branch in SVN right now, and I merged a couple of branches to trunk last friday.

Why is it needed? Because without prices, sane economic decisions are impossible. With so many choices on what to produce and what to produce it with, and with scarcity in mind, we have to have a way to put resources to efficient use, instead of just guessing. Having prices that come from supply and demand has been historically proven to be the best way of putting resources to efficient use.<p>Not only does the video fail to acknowledge the importance of a price system, but it comes bundled with a couple of flawed premises, one of them being the Marxist theory of technological improvement leading to unemployment in a capitalist society.<p>To anyone who thinks that 'Yes!

You can use it yourself entirely on our own workstation, you can use it on a company server only your devs have access to, and you can of course make public repos on your own hardware or with hosted solutions such as github.com.<p>Git is also arguably more secure than many other VCSs since it (in a very very small and generalizing nutshell) works by creating a directed graph of SHA sums.  You can't change a file and propagate those changes to other people without everyone being well aware of what has been done.  Not unless you can compute <i>useful</i> code that collides with existing code... check out what linus has to say about that improbability some time^ ;).<p>No, security shouldn't be the issue for enterprise companies, though scalability is often cited as a potential issue.  If you currently use perforce to a heavy degree, you might have some issues with going to git.  This is not to say that git cannot work for very large companies, it probably just isn't going to work well if you put every project in your large company in a single one or two repos (as many companies do with perforce).

Every feature of git may be liability in some environments<p>* I might need a controlled server with an audit-trail where any ability to rewrite history is a liability. SVN wins hands down here.<p>* I might want the ability to lock binary files since my repo is mainly a set of designs created by the gfx people. SVN wins.<p>* I might want the ability to mount the repo as webdav folder since I want accountants to store their XLS-Files in there without knowing what's that funky version control system. Git can't do.<p>* I might want to commit on the road, in the plane, in my cabin in the woods. SVN fails hard.<p>* On the contrary, maybe my environment is such that the svn server is on the local network and I actually feel uncomfortable with people running around with their laptops and all of my VCS history on them.

The URL is http://www.layervault.com<p>LayerVault keeps track of what you're working on without adding extra steps to your process. The app runs in your toolbar and tracks changes you make to your files. Basically  each time you create or modify a file youre working on, LayerVault saves a copy. You can then login, flip through its versions, and download a version from a few weeks ago.<p>It's pretty neat  and weve built some stuff that makes impact to bandwidth pretty much negligible. We've been testing it with a small beta group for a little while now, and we're pretty excited.<p>A handful of beta invites are floating around but we're going to be open the private beta to more people today.<p>As always, feedback is welcome.",1314714839

I have an Intuos4 but being tethered to my computer and confined to a graphics editing program is a lot of overhead for me (not an artist) when I want to get something digital done.  I can see this being able to freely create web site mockups and wireframes, rough logo work, annotations, etc.  I think this will fit into my workflow.  I like the promise of being able to utilize this without having to be near my computer.",1314712992

While I worked on it, I dutifully read the mailing lists and such to learn what I could about this technology.  This experience taught me that every awful piece of technology has a halo of zealots who think it's the greatest, and is just now (still) on the verge of taking over its field. And should you hint that there might be anything better, they have a litany of reasons why <i>you</i> are the problem, because you don't understand it.  The whole thing is about as odd as watching the domestic life of someone who has married their vacuum cleaner.<p>Some of the defenders of subversion here reminded me of that experience.  The more truculent defenders slash at those who point out its deficiencies with remarks about their ignorance of subversion, and if you don't take a couple of weeks out of your schedule to learn its thorny ways then you deserve your problems.  The milder defenders will equivocate and claim that its just a preference, and that subversion isn't nearly as painful as long as everyone on the team always unfailingly follows this list of 178 rules on what not to do.",1314712985

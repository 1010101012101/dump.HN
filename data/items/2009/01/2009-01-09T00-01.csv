Imagine there are two languages, which run equally efficiently for equivalent problem specifications.

The second is something like Haskell; most of its concepts come from mathematics and formal computer science, and as such it places fairly strong restrictions on what you can and cannot do.<p>Both of these would be capable of calculating whatever you wanted (assuming they're both Turing-complete), but the C-like language would be better suited for tasks that require knowledge of the hardware (systems programming) while the Haskell-like language would be better suited for mathematical/theoretical type programs.

When everyone knows everyone else in a system, they are able to provide for one another because they personally know what everyone needs and can react quickly without going through seven layers of bureaucracy.  When the government's reach grows so large that they don't know their citizens, then they have to rely on formalized metrics and laws to determine how resources should be allocated, and it is that sort of overhead which causes the inefficiency that you speak of.  This effect is similar to companies:  When they first start out, they are agile and able to outpace their competitors in the market, but once they get too big, they cease to innovate and have a hard time meeting the demands of changes in the market.",1231460745

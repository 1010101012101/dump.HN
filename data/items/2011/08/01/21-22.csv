The buyer needs to trust the seller to pay.<p>Part of this is handled by the transaction process where the seller doesn't typically send something until paid but the buyer if unnscrupulous can always do CC chargebacks, cancel checks or the like. The buyer just has to trust the seller.<p>Reputation is the big part in this but is no guarantee. Actually what Ebay needs is to show the total <i>value</i> of buy and sell transactions <i>separately</i>, not just the number of transactions.<p>AirBnB seeks to solve these same problems with reputation.<p>The problem? At worst on Ebay, the buyer or seller loses 100% of the transaction's value. On AirBnB, the potential loss is many thousands time the value and can include irreparable harm (eg murder, serious assault, rape, etc).<p>What's more they're facilitating people doing something generally not allowed by their leases (if they rent) or by legislation or regulation. That's potentially a huge problem.<p>So it's fitting they set up this kind of insurance guarantee. Much like Ebay securing transactions (to some degree at least), the extra confidence in the system promotes its use.<p>I don't believe this is an end to AirBnB's problems however. They're simply kicked the can further down the street.<p>Imagine this scenario: someone rents a house through AirBnB while the owner is away. They set up a meth lab. The meth lab explodes, burning down the house, burning down 2 neighbours' houses and kills three people, two of them innocents. What a huge liability mess that would be. Who is responsible? Clearly the person who set up the meth lab are responsible but a canny lawyer will argue that AirBnB and the owner were negligent in their actions.",1312235191

Both of which are covered under US law.<p>>But in the more general case, I find it difficult to believe that the notion of Prior Art is unaffected by the elimination of first-to-invent. Under the new rules, if the PTO considers two patents determined to cover the same invention, they will accept the one filed first and decline the one filed later, even if the first-filed invention was invented at a later date. If a patent lawsuit can reverse this decision by finding prior art, then how can these be reconciled?<p>If there is clear prior art before either were filed, then the patent would be nullfiied in either a First to File or First to Invent scenario.<p>I think that you're confusing prior art and what first to file/invent means.<p>First to File and First to Invent means that if two people file for an identical patent, the patent is granted based on either the filing date or the invention date.  The only time that First to File applies is when two independent inventors file for the same patent in the same timeframe.  Ovbiously, one cannot try to patent an idea after the patent has been accepted, even if they did invent first.<p>Prior art applies to all patents, based on the date of the filing of the patents.  If I try to patent something that someone else is selling, like a mousetrap design, then it should get thrown out, no matter when I actually invented it, because it's already in production by someone else.",1312235007

But AirBnB didn't do much to help Troy (from the TechCrunch post) 2 months ago, and that story didn't blow up in to a PR disaster.  They simply gave him a few free nights and he was happy.<p>So, it is impossible to tell if any given customer support issue is a potential ""PR-nightmare"".  If AirBnB had over-reacted and offered Troy thousands of dollars (as was being suggested for EJ), they would have lost out - because Troy was happy with just a few free nights in AirBnB credit.  How were they supposed to know that EJ (1) wouldn't be happy with what Troy received (2) Would make a scathing blog post and (3) That blog post would go viral.  They couldn't have.<p>So, if you are a wagering person, it seems like the best course of action is to do exactly what AirBnB did: offering minimal support and grow until something really bad happens.  Then come out swinging with a big apology and a big offer of support and restitution.<p>Since it seems like the media and public are willing to forgive AirBnB (judging by the reaction to today's announcement), this course seems like it may have been optimal compared to over-helping people like Troy.<p>Put another way: PR distasters are recoverable if you say you are sorry and ask forgiveness.

Also, and this may be a little bit of closing the barn door a couple of months too late, but one assumes that guest/host welfare would've been paramount right from the beginning, as one case like EJ's demonstrated how vulnerable a publicly-facing business model can be, as any real life business/insurance executive could've explained.<p>Is it me or did the idea of making off with $50,000 in renovations cross anyone else's mind? I think telegraphing the intent to pay a guaranteed specific amount sets the new minimum for fraudulent activity and removes the burden of responsibility from the hosts, whose relation to Airbnb is that of a customer, not a business partner.<p>And yes, back in the old days and out of necessity, people did stay in other people's homes, but not every apartment was a rooming house and the landlord was usually on the premises.",1312233029

Google's nominal operating mode burns a lot of money, that burn rate leaves them vulnerable to down turns. What the most likely scenario is not that they get disrupted so much as others meet them at parity but run at an operationally much more efficient way. Say that M$/Bing inexorably creeps up into a neck and neck race with Google in terms of search reach, and the combination pushes down advertising rates. The spending brakes go on at the 'plex, the company changes, the bean counters rise in power beyond reasonable measure, and the company 'flips'. Out go the creative, inventive, people and in come the 'lifers' who know how to make their job look important without actually doing anything. The mechansim which makes this happen is really hard to avoid since from the board room things look fine, even after they aren't fine. And there is a fine balance of disbelief that is held between the employees and their condition that, once disrupted, cannot be re-established. Cisco, HP (Tandem), Sun, and Intel are all places where I've known folks who lived through the flip. Nothing is the same afterwards, if you can't re-invent yourself like Apple did, it gets a lot harder.<p>That being said, there is (as others point out) usually some time to cover for that.<p>I cannot stress enough however that financial planning is serious business and you should take your time with it. I believed them when they said if I started putting money in my 401K in 1986 that it would be worth multiple millions by now thanks to the 'miracle' of compound interest. They missed the part about the 'miracle' of the nations worst economic debacle deleting that value in a heartbeat. I don't believe them any more :-(",1312232475

2834381,comment,2834226,2834299,1,0,ejp,,,"Agreed, I think this shows where government spending is a primary economic force more than anything else. New Mexico for instance is full of federally-funded labs and nuclear facilities, and has a low population - so per capita government spending looks huge. The tradeoff here is that other, more populous states don't have WIPP in their backyard. Not to mention all the useful environmental factors NM offers (like White Sands).<p>With so many other factors affecting where overall government spending goes, it would be a mistake to link this to politics at all.",1312232444

It always strikes me as odd that Americans prefer a system in which each state has almost total control, up to and including its own constitution.  You're left with things like California being insolvent and practically unsalvageable, Arizona mandating racial profiling and giving retarded cowboys like Arpaio free reign, Kansas banning science, most everywhere banning gay marriage... it's just a very strange and haphazard system.  My best friend in high school was from San Francisco and his father hated our system, saying we had ceded all our freedom to the federal government, were socialists, and all manner of other invectives.  Given how messed up everything is down there, I wouldn't really be complaining.",1312232429

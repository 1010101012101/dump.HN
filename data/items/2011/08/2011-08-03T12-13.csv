This was discussed at length on Stack Exchange podcast #9 (I believe) when the author of ""Making Software"" was a guest. This exact topic was discussed at length.<p>Java is for better or worse more verbose than Python, which means more lines of code which means more opportunity for bugs. It is hardly nonsensical. That opinion is a product of language-centric parochialism with no regard for actual fact.<p>Ditto for the ""just work"" line being a ""delusion."" Like it or not, Python does indeed ""just work"" in most cases. This isn't unique to Python of course, but I do think that is a fair opinion of the author to hold.",1312376354

2840934,comment,2839742,2840705,1,0,demallien,,,"Firstly, CoffeeScript <i>is</i> built in JavaScript. Does that make it a 'real' Lisp?<p>Secondly, Lisp macros are every bit as big a security risk as using eval...  That is what the E in REPL stands for, after all. In both cases, if you are taking input from source code, and not from outside sources, there is no security risk.<p>Thirdly, yes, my example is messy. But it is still doable, and I just have a hard time believing that this kind of programming is a major percentage of the code of a Lisp program.  To be clear on that comment, I can easily believe that you end up invoking macros a lot, but I don't believe that a large percentage of the code written for a project is actually macros.  What percentage of code in a typical project is macros?  And how many of those macros can be easily reproduced by using specialised syntax of a language such as ruby (optional parantheses, blocks, re-opening classes, method_missing, etc)?<p>This is an important point, because if you only have a few hundred lines of this stuff in a typical Lisp program, and it can be reproduced by using a parser in another (dynamic) language, then the advantage just isn't that big. For argument's sake, imagine having a module available in Javascript that provides the Jison parser along with the Javascript grammar, which just re-emits the original Javascript source.  In addition, it has a nice API to allow you to modify the grammar (adding / modifying rules).  So far so easy, this stuff already exists in CoffeeScript, go copy it from there. Now, having loaded such a module, is Lisp really in a much better position than this modified Javascript?",1312376215

A window on the left side of a house is the same as windows in the right side of a house. Even trees are similar (hell, they are self-similar, you can use a fractal to build them). Textures are often similar and repetitive.<p>Yeah there is this intermediate level of detail between the molecules and whole buildings (like surface imprefections, dirt) that might not be as repetitive.

It's usually not the right thing to do""</i>\nActually, tearing down a building and rebuilding is very often the right thing to do, but isn't done for the same reasons people don't toss their code and rewrite from scratch - sunk costs.<p>Unlike software, new buildings are almost invariably significantly more efficient and less resource intensive than old ones - and green building has, of course, gone from a fringe movement in the wake of the Rio Summit, to the mainstream and is now standard for public and corporate buildings.<p>Like poorly written software old buildings are expensive to operate and maintain (and unlike well written software buildings still deteriorate over time when left only to their own devices). Finally, like software  one must go through old buildings and figure how systems were designed and installed and patched in order to modify them - and this is very time consuming.

2840897,comment,2839580,2840591,1,0,Argorak,,,"I am not ""offended"", but I think the effect could be much improved by at least hearing the guys actually working on the site first - not negotiating, but collect their problems as well. Yes, there are many problems - but they are not that there are not enough editors or none of them cares. For example, we would happily announce every tiny conference on the site and could also do that, if organizers would just send us a short note. I think most of us would do with a link and write the article themselves. Instead, there are major conferences that seem to be announced on twitter only.\nWhat I cannot and do not want to do (I am also tending for a german ruby portal next to this job) is actively scrape the interwebs for such information.<p>Also, there is no-one who takes stewardship of the technical part of the site - the ""popular projects"" widget that is still backed by an effectively dead site (rubyforge) is one of them. This is not a unique problem: rubygems.org has similar problems of finding people to implement/change features. This would be important.<p>When it comes to languages: I am not sure whether 20 languages is okay, but I am quite proud that we do actually have non-english sites and can link to non-english resources. I reckon that the japanese community likes it as well. As long as there is someone pouring its time into it, i'm fine with it - and its actually not working as bad as it seems.<p>My biggest problem is that the Ruby community is big on decentralization and no one cares about dragging stuff back together. For example, there are at least 2 people managing great documentation indices (ruby-doc.org and rubydoc.info) that wouldn't have evolved if we had integrated the docs into the main site. What I would really enjoy would be a team that tries to organize that forest a bit and maybe direct efforts of volunteers.",1312375461

""Oh I understand what the code does, I just don't understand why the coder did it that particular way"" is an admission that the previous statement wasn't a qualified one. It's an admission that the programmer had no intention of approaching management with a rational conversation on the topic, just a, ""Hey boss I'm going to re-do this whole thing"". No one wants conversations like that in a professional environment, people are too busy with actual real problems for that kind of thing.<p>It takes a more technical manager than most IMHO to properly adjust for that kind of behavior, however. Many managers don't understand the technology as much  as those they manage (perhaps it's different in strictly programming environments), and at some point ""have to trust"" what someone is telling them in shorthand. That is bad in this business. It may work in other industries, but it won't work here. A technical manager needs to be able to challenge a technical idea on it's merits, not on the aura of the challenger.<p>It doesn't mean coders have to approach managers with a four-page paper rationalizing their need to tie their shoes differently, and as the team gets used to the increased communication and personalities, shorthand understandings relevant to the team will become used. But it should always be placed on the foundation of proof. Trust but verify.<p>Treat your coders like adults, hold them to that higher burden of proof standard, and hold yourself as a manager to a higher technical standard to understand it, and the entire team can avoid this kind of junk. I come from network administration, and on medium to larger sized teams I've found that at first the smarter guys hate this method because they're used to being left alone to save the day. Being challenged ruffles their feathers in the beginning. After a little while, however, they realize that they're going to earn more respect because everyone around them, or at least their boss, is actually going to understand their brilliance.",1312374853

Our displays are finally getting denser (which lets us use smaller font sizes successfully) and wider.<p>And the desire to avoid 120-character-wide columns isn't some arbitrary fetish of print design. Over-width columns actively hinder readability. Robert Bringhurst:<p><i>Anything from 45 to 75 characters is widely regarded as a satisfactory length of line for a single-column page set in a serifed typeface in a text size. The 66-character line (counting both letters and spaces) is widely regarded as ideal. For multiple-column work, a better average is 40 to 50 characters.</i><p><i>If the type is well set and printed, lines of 85 or 90 characters will pose no problem in discontinuous texts, such as bibliographies, or, with generous leading, in footnotes. But even with generous leading, a line that averages more than 75 or 80 characters is likely to be too long for continuous reading.</i><p>These typographical rules of thumb are ultimately derived from human physiology -- limiting the range through which the eye has to skip left and right makes reading more relaxing, and the mental act of trying to go from the right edge of a mile-wide paragraph to the left edge without losing one's place is fatiguing. [1]<p>Up to now web designers have coped by forcing a single column, forcing that column to be of limited width, and just padding out the remaining width with navigation elements or whitespace. But the whitespace begins to look ridiculous when it's 80% of the width of the screen.<p>So we're probably going to see more instances of successful multi-column layouts. This is likely to break continuous scrolling, but on a device which supports useful multi-column layouts you'll probably be okay with page-by-page scrolling. Or, well, not. We shall see.<p>---<p>[1] I highly recommend resizing the HN screen if you want to read one of my doorstopper comments. ;)",1312374760

In Lisp, you have to spend significant time on this trivial stuff. So if you are writing a program on your own PC for your own use, then Lisp is fine. If you are programming anything that is going to run on existing infrastructure or interoperate with other programs, it's very difficult to justify the additional effort of using Lisp.<p>And I know a bit about this: I wrote Oracle bindings for OCaml!

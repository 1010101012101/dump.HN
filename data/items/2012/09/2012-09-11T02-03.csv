Human demand for calories is relatively constant, for obvious reasons, but only accounts for a small majority of grain demand in normal years.   The remainder is consumed by animals and by industrial processes.<p>When grain gets expensive, feeding animals becomes expensive.  Raising them becomes unprofitable, so farmers dump their animals onto the market which 1) lowers the price of meat 2) makes a large number of meat calories available for human consumption when they are needed most and 3) reduces the demand for grain, dampening the price rise for grain.<p>This effect has mostly replaced the need for the long-term grain storage that countries used to do.<p>So why isn't working now?

So there select * becomes very useful as a way of ensuring that the data structures on output can be simply re-used later.<p>Of course if you are doing pure physical storage queries, select * is probably not what you want but if you have a logical model built up, you may want to do select * from it in order to ensure that your output matches some specific set of rules.",1347329909

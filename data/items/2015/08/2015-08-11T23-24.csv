Now Grindr, that&#x27;s a COMPLETELY different story -- I&#x27;ve known people literally do the &#x27;parking garage oral sex&#x27; thing in a matter of an hour from start to finish.

The JIT automatically detects &quot;hot&quot; methods and try to inline them for you. A method is considered &quot;hot&quot; if it was executed more the X times, where X is a threshold that can be configured using a JVM flag when start up java (10000 is the default). This is needed as inlining all methods would do more harm then anything else, because of the enormous produced byte-code. Beside this the JIT may &quot;revert&quot; previous inlined code when an optimization turns out to be wrong at a later state. Remember the JIT stands for Just in Time and so optimize (which includes inlining but also other things) while execute your code.&quot;",1439337425

The part I like about snapchat the most is that there&#x27;s no history -- you send an image, and it&#x27;s gone, so there&#x27;s no particular &#x27;baggage&#x27; associated with it: no long thread of comments, no &#x27;history&#x27; to look at, no tedious &#x27;you didn&#x27;t like my comment/omg i got 300 likes&#x27;.

My point here is to not get stuck on the words used - but the meaning <i>intended</i> behind them.<p>:::End Edit<p>Discussing the larger context when you&#x27;ve already delved into a specific context isn&#x27;t merely nitpicking, it&#x27;s intellectually dishonest. I&#x27;ll give you a contrived example, albeit not an exact comparison of the current issue, to illustrate my point:<p>Argument: &quot;Rottweilers and Dobermans are prone to heart conditions.&quot;<p>Counterargument: &quot;Dogs are not prone to heart conditions!&quot;<p>Well, the context has already been specified to a niche. Both statements are true but are now arguing what are fundamentally different things. One is talking about specific breeds (subsections) of the species (idea) &quot;dog&quot; while the other is talking about the species &quot;dog&quot;.<p>It would be intellectually dishonest to argue about &quot;dogs&quot; when the person was arguing for &quot;Rottweilers and Dobermans&quot;. Even if both belong to &quot;dogs&quot;.<p>Gender/racial identity politics are both subsections of &quot;identity politics&quot;. They had already delved into an argument/subsection regarding gender/racial identity politics, and then you went and argue about the broader concept of &quot;identity politics&quot;. The issue is you do not want to actually argue against his points. You wanted to argue about his usage of &quot;identity politics&quot;. That&#x27;s intellectually dishonest.<p>Here&#x27;s a better way to approach someone either misusing a term or using a broad term where a more specific term would suit their argument better:<p>&quot;Identity politics is a broad term and could include &#x27;free vs proprietary&#x27; ideals, which is the foundation of Open Source / FOSS. It sounds like you&#x27;re arguing about &#x27;gender politics&#x27;. I want to make sure we&#x27;re on the same page.&quot;<p>They can then clarify that yes, they meant &quot;gender politics&quot; and they might even apologize for using a term that was too broad in meaning.<p>The point of a debate is to counter someone&#x27;s arguments, which means you have to make some effort to see their arguments as how they were <i>intended</i> rather than how they were <i>stated</i>.<p>That means do not nitpick over trivialities and definitions. If you&#x27;re unclear on a definition of a word they are using, have them clarify it. But to purposefully misunderstand and argue an entirely different concept is unfair to the other person. Especially if they don&#x27;t recognize what you are doing.

You make your mud pie and then you patent &quot;system and method for creating a mud pie with lava stones.&quot;<p>Perhaps there is no prior art because nobody asked for a mud pie with lava stones, perhaps there is no prior art because others who made mud pies with lava stones didn&#x27;t see anything useful about it.

And the patent office grants it.<p>The question I pose is how to come up with a defense that anyone skilled in the art of making a mud pie, would make one with lava stones in just that way ?  And yes, I know all the legal arguments why it doesn&#x27;t work like that, so my point is how do we fix the patent system such that utility patents on methods or combinations of methods, would likely be independently arrived at by anyone skillled in the art?<p>How do we fix it so that Cisco, writing their patent free video codec in the open, doesn&#x27;t get &quot;scooped&quot; by someone taking their project, projecting out a month or a year in advance of what it is going to need to work, and then throwing together a provisional that pre-dates the open source project getting there, thus depriving the people working on Cisco&#x27;s efforts their ability to ship without hindrance?<p>[1] Really, just dirt and water.",1439336736

New arguments need new information, and the vast majority of arguments in that area have been had already.  That&#x27;s some of the primary value provided by their wiki: a repository of past arguments and refutations, to avoid having to revisit them every time.<p>Project mailing lists and other communication channels, for instance, are the wrong place for repeated introductory conversations demanding justifications for a code of conduct.

That I don&#x27;t personally find any of your arguments even remotely compelling towards that end doesn&#x27;t make those assumptions immutable.<p>To explicitly state some of the assumptions that I suspect we disagree on: 1) If you refuse to exclude anyone from a project, then you&#x27;re by default excluding people who are not willing to put up with a hostile environment.  2) Since you can&#x27;t avoid excluding people, better to exclude people who make the project less welcoming.  3) Don&#x27;t let the people you want to exclude write the policy.  4) Don&#x27;t let the people who would fare just fine in a project without a code of conduct drive the requirements; get the requirements from people who <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i>.<p>Apart from that, the other reason I don&#x27;t particularly care about having this argument here is that it&#x27;s unlikely to have as much effect as having it elsewhere.",1439335190

The concern over threats back then was VASTLY lower than today, because the threat was in fact far lesser.  Computers were vastly less interconnected and knowledge about exploit tactics was still nascent, and a fair bit harder to come by.  Stuff was <i>massively</i> exploitable because in the &quot;good &#x27;ol days&quot; there were a lot fewer computer literate people to think about things like &quot;attack surface&quot;, and fewer still who had motive to use such knowledge maliciously.  I knew grad students back in the 80&#x27;s who had written their own illicit versions of &quot;su&quot; to make their lives easier.  I.e. local privilege escalation tools.  An undergrad banned (and transformed into an overnight pariah amongst his peers) for hacking CS dept servers.  All kinds of devices hacked by the curious via some hardware port intended for maintenance or just left behind on the PCB.  Those things happened, but the collective impact of much of that is less than one major exploit pattern today (Flash 0-day, legacy consumer routers, take your pick).<p>No, the root problem vs &quot;yesterday&quot; is just that our computers are cheaper and far more interconnected than ever before. Things like the option-ROM-as-vector being an economically practical technology.  Our collective level of ability to ship secure systems is probably far better than it ever has been, but that&#x27;s almost nothing in the face of an exponential explosion in the pervasiveness of computing.  We still ship an incredible amount of insecure software and hardware systems, just because we make so damn much of it.  Why design a complex fixed <i>mechanism</i> or <i>circuit</i> for something when you can solve the problem 1000x better with a CPU or DSP?  That&#x27;s great, but &quot;oops, we forgot the security again.&quot;  Or we didn&#x27;t, but an exploit was <i>still</i> found and updating is otherwise infeasible.<p>It seems that ability to ship secure tech needs to be nearly pervasive, enough for a sort of technological herd-immunity (or herd-defense-in-depth), if you will.

I didn&#x27;t write it, but I reviewed it.<p>Yes, this is a blatant advertisement.  We worked hard on these open source project, believe they are great, and were trying to argue for their use from a commonly overlooked perspective.  It should surprise no one that an article on our site advocates for one of our open source projects. I don&#x27;t think arguing for something you benefit from should disqualify the argument.  Instead, it should make any claims we make fall under more intense scrutiny.<p>Now about longevity, there really isn&#x27;t a fair comparison.  JavaScriptMVC is far older then Backbone, Knockout, Angular and React.  They, for the most part, haven&#x27;t even had to evolve.  Their technology is, for the most part, still pretty modern.  We&#x27;ll see how they do.<p>Here&#x27;s how JavaScriptMVC evolved:<p>JavaScriptMVC started on PrototypeJS.  It did almost everything a Backbone + RequireJS + Karma + DocJS setup does today.  Except much worse!  It used:<p>- PrototypeJS (jQuery had only first released)<p>- RhinoJS (the only viable server-side JS runtime)<p>- EJS for templates like `<%= foo %>`<p>- Steal syntax for loading scripts `steal(dependencies)`<p>- Selenium for test driving<p>It had the only working &quot;event delegation&quot; system.  This was one of its big features.  It also had:<p>- basic modeling<p>- basic routing<p>Since that time, we&#x27;ve  probably done more then anyone else to adapt and evolve the tools and technology so a reasonable person could upgrade.  Some of my favorite highlights:<p>1.  We updated StealJS to support AMD/CJS/ES6 syntaxes while still supporting the old steal syntax.  We also migrated its build system from RhinoJS to NodeJS.<p>2.  We swapped out Prototype for a compatibility layer that runs on jQuery / Zepto / Dojo / Mootools / YUI
3.  I helped jQuery add event delegation so we could drop it from JMVC in jQuery 1.4.<p>4.  We added live-binding EJS templates.<p>5.  We added live-binding Handlebars-like templates.  And then re-wrote that again to be 2x faster.<p>6.  We added custom elements, two-way bindings.<p>7.  I&#x27;m currently rewriting how we do data-connection:  <a href=""http://connect.canjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://connect.canjs.com/</a>, while still providing a backwards compatible version: <a href=""http://connect.canjs.com/doc/can-connect%7Ccan%7Cmodel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://connect.canjs.com/doc/can-connect%7Ccan%7Cmodel.html</a><p>8.  Live-reload technology<p>9.  A progressive bundling algorithm.<p>10. Migrated documentjs from Rhino to NodeJS, make it support multi-versioned docs.<p>If this article had come out 3-4 weeks from now you&#x27;ll see we added:<p>1. Server-side rendering (Isomorphic / Universal JavaScript)<p>2. Worker-thread rendering with virtual dom merges.<p>We started when JavaScript was in its infancy and managed to evolve our tools and technology to keep pace with innovation constantly happening in our space.  I really don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s another project that&#x27;s undergone such a transformation.<p>When Angular was released, people thought putting click handlers back in a template was silly.  Same with React&#x27;s Virtual DOM approach. Those things have turned out to be great.  We&#x27;ve added them (or are just about to).<p>We&#x27;ve tried to keep changes as small as possible between major versions. I think we&#x27;ve walked the line well between change and backwards compatibility.<p>So in the end, we&#x27;re very proud of these accomplishments.  We believe they are unique and mean something.  That&#x27;s what this article was about.<p>Btw, I give a free weekly JS training tomorrow.

Using simple circuits based on widely-proven physics is much better than complex circuits leveraging cryptographic assumptions. Often more efficient, too. This could have also have application in security-critical boards and ASIC&#x27;s (esp mixed-signal) aiming to re-use proven blocks. I&#x27;ve forwarded it to a high-security specialist that sometimes makes and breaks hardware TRNG&#x27;s to get his take on it. Hopefully, he&#x27;ll reply while it&#x27;s still getting HN attention.<p>&quot;So from this, we have a theoretically strong basis for efficient extraction of good entropy. We have sources of noise which are naturally white and for which the best scientific understanding is that the mechanisms underlying them are subatomic scale events which are as independently random as any kind of physical phenomenon is known to be. We have multiple sources of noise that are not all influenced by the same set of physical or environmental conditions. We have a mechanism to extract it which ensures good mixing over time and is robust against interference from predictable signals, over a wide range for the noise floor mean. We can implement it in a way which makes it obvious that no programmed manipulation of the process output is taking place. It is self stable and doesn&#x27;t require continuous tuning to operate correctly. And we can clock bits out of it at just about any rate we please up to the effective bandwidth of the circuitry responsible for doing that.&quot;",1439334632

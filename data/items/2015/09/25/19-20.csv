10280327,comment,10276968,10280323,0,0,mzs,,,"With time seat belt use became much more prevalent in US. At that point depowered airbags were allowed and they rapidly became common place (due to the attention created from the deaths and injuries caused my the prior systems - of which there were few around 200 at that time, vastly out numbered by those benefited) and practically no cost difference. That brought US and EU airbags more in line, but there was still a critical difference. The US airbags were often larger. It was not all about preventing the ejection of an unbelted occupant though. Another consideration was the front middle seat occupant (most often a child with only a lap belt at best) which was still common due to non-extended cab pickups and family/luxury cars with a front bench seat.<p>Which now brings me to advanced frontal airbags which are now required in US in entire passenger and light truck fleet for just over nine years. Essentially the minimum is that the system calculates occupant weight to determine if the airbag will be prevented from deploying. There is moreover a requirement that the SRS warning label state that an advanced airbag system is in place (with specific clear wording) and also an indicator light (also specifically clearly labeled) indication when the passenger front airbag is disabled. It is very common for the advanced frontal airbag system to also take into account factors such as collision forces and whether the occupant is belted or not in deciding whether to deploy the airbag or not. There are now also systems in place that in addition to all of that also take into account individual seat and spool positions. More over dual igniter systems are becoming more common place, so that front airbag can be inflated more rapidly (though more forcefully) only if needed. In addition multi-stage and variable output air bag systems are permitted in US as well, though they are rarer and typically in more costly cars.<p>So it really is becoming that US regulations are coming more in line to that of EU and with time and further tweaking of the regs it will become a moot difference - the airbags will be very smart and only deploy most forcefully only when safe and most necessary. Along the way there were many benefits. The US regs are not stagnant nor created in a vacuum as some seem to think. There was history, market forces, and data to what took place and when. Here is one further benefit to the US system that not many people expect: Over time the rules <i>were</i> in fact different across Europe regarding air bags. For example Spain&#x27;s requirements were slightly different from France&#x27;s at different times and what happens when you bring that car into Poland and sell it? What about if you bring an older Polish car and sell it in Spain or France, oh boy! There are a number of differences that fall under the US advanced airbag umbrella all handled differently in those three countries at different times, for example in what is permitted regarding the switch based on weight vs. a physical switch and if the seat belt is latched or not to how this is all indicated and labeled. It&#x27;s a real mess. In US, you just flip the sun visor down and read what you have. Even the procedure for after market alteration specifies that that warning label must be amended appropriately - and how that is to be worded is very specifically laid-out. It&#x27;s quite impressive to me actually how well this all was thought-out.<p>Now as to the article. It&#x27;s not a very good article really. Here&#x27;s the paper itself (pdf):<p><a href=""http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/112977/103199.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/11297...</a><p>I&#x27;ve read through parts and I&#x27;ll not touch the issue of how it relates to TTIP, but really it shows both in some ways how some EU regs are seeming better and how some US regs as well are seemingly better when you examine crashes statistically. Of course there is not nearly as much raw data for example in the headlight example (you can read the paper itself for details, essentially they had to cull the data down to one hour in one month per each territory and that effects confidence in the result). But to my eyes it really is not all that damning for the US airbag system. The worst results are for high speed driver side front/side airbag deployments (which are difficult to begin with) but when I read through I am not convinced it is factoring all differences from region to region sufficiently to have such a strong claim. For example it&#x27;s only more recently that advanced airbags were introduced and the early systems were cruder than the current commonly used systems. Cars tend to stay on the road longer in US than EU (particularly in the regions without inspections where my further points will hold as well) so there were many cars with cruder SRS in place. There are many rural areas in those places the roads are not illuminated, there is oncoming and side traffic, wild-life, and people travel are high speed. Further there are more higher GVW cars on the roads in US which could affect the side impact statistics largely to the extent highlighted in my opinion. Notice how well the US does in rollover, that&#x27;s largely because the market here is different and so it was addressed because there were more cars more prone to roll overs and more people were suffering. So I read over the paper and I personally do not yet believe it controlled for the differences in territories sufficiently.<p>That said, it&#x27;s an excellent paper with some surprising results. What I take away from it is really it is a further impetus to move the advanced airbag systems in place in US farther to the higher tech and at least dual-mode operation across the entire fleet. You will never be able to fully address the belted vs. unbelted completely in US simply for practical reasons like people using light trucks in a manner where they back or egress the vehicle often so it&#x27;s good to still account for it intelligently. Also it would seem wise for the EU to investigate US illumination requirements as they pertain to pedestrian safety cause the results were tantalizing there (though possibly not controlled well enough as well as lacking sufficient data) in the same way that I would hope that US is investigating autodipping intelligent headlights now.",1443211069

There are many people claiming outdated info as current fact and misinterpreting what the differences actually imply in US v. EU occupant crash protection.<p>Regarding the airbags. The US now requires advanced frontal airbags in all passenger cars and light trucks. It started phasing them in back in 2003. Moreover prior in 1997 the NHTSA permitted depowered airbags which rapidly became the norm. Here is a nice FAQ with more details:<p><a href=""http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/Air+Bags/Advanced+Frontal+Air+Bags"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/Air+Bags/Advanced+F...</a><p>Now for the gist and background: In the &#x27;70s GM pioneered research into airbags (as an aside the interior of the contemporary Volvo SCC which became the 240 simply looked like a bumper car instead <a href=""https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/12042626_10207667920518779_6625614908511727712_n.jpg?oh=feb6211b1933a4d6878c0142c6221973&oe=568FAABE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/12042626...</a> ). In the world as a whole (not just US) seat belt use was dismal. So initially it was hoped that they could be used without seat belts. Since the original systems were so cumbersome (for example one of them used a bottle of compressed gas) and complicated (the original acceptable switches were wighted metal balls with rings of conductors and springs) it took quite a while for them to get developed to the point that they were acceptably reliable, safe, and priced. To give an example, one consideration not immediately obvious is how the head rebounds off the airbag and into what with how much force. It took quite a lot of development that is not appreciated my most people these days, very worthwhile effort which has saved and improved the quality of life for many.<p>Yet by that point in time seat belt use was still abysmal in US. In some parts of Western Europe it was improving more rapidly. So policy was in US for the airbags to deploy faster and bigger (which might not be expected, but the reason is that the occupant might be not where you expect, for example sliding down into the footwell or about to be ejected from a window). The interesting aspect to this is that there is data that the US style was even better for belted adult occupants (of not small stature - more on that in a bit) in more severe accidents. This is because until the more recent advent of seat belt pretensioners and later knee bolsters it was common for occupants to slide under the steering wheel while braking or have their chest pulled in to closer than 10&quot; from the air bag cover from same braking.<p>One other thing to keep in mind is that air bags were seen as a supplemental restraint system due to the lack of seat belt use in US and the requirements were initially for there to be such an SRS in place (not necessarily airbags) for certain fleet percentages by certain dates. One unexpected result was that airbag fleet saturation was lower than predicted initially due to a fluke of history. Airbags by that point used explosive charges and there were a number of snafus in their manufacture initially related to that. Ford in particular was very hard hit but a number of European makes faced shortages as well. That shortage and changing US regulation were two more reason why Peugeot pulled-out of US market since they could not surmount in a profitable manner for example. This led to the proliferation of systems that would have the shoulder belt in place at all times. Chrysler in particular benefited greatly from dumb luck in that the suppliers it had picked did not have any factories blow-up essentially and even had marketing in place at the time touting how their cars had airbags while their competitors did not.<p>Now back to short occupants: It was realized that the airbags were injuring or killing occupants in some cases early on. Again at that time seat belt use was still poor in US. So aftermarket airbag cut-off switches were permitted. There was also a process for having them certified for use. It was not uncommon for people that needed them (smaller drivers, those that needed to transport a child in the front, elderly, and so on) to have them installed at a dealer and shortly after that they became common place in US cars which were most likely to need them (such as pickups) as standard equipment.",1443211051

If you have a programming language where a typical program looks like line noise, it means the programming language is going to likely have a very steep learning curve (because a lot of those operators are probably not going to have their standardized meaning).<p>Think about Python.  A well-written Python program is similar to the pseudocode you would write on a napkin.  For a concrete example, look at the whitepaper&#x27;s definition of I1 in pseudo-code.  The &quot;pseudo-Hoon&quot; implementation of I1 looks totally different from the pseudocode, and to even begin to read the Hoon code, I would have to look up the meanings of approximately 10 different operators.<p>I guess there are two different camps of language design -- the Perl / Ruby / shell camp where having lots of non-standard operators in your syntax is desirable, and the C / Python / Lua camp which prefers a small set of operators with meanings close to their &quot;standard&quot; mathematical ones.",1443210562

10280210,comment,10277470,10279971,0,0,derefr,,,"I think you&#x27;re under a mistaken view of what OS distro packages exist for. The &quot;system ruby&quot; and other such packages aren&#x27;t for end-user (or developer) consumption; they exist for the sake of <i>other system packages</i>, in case a piece of <i>system software</i> needs to run some Ruby code.<p>&quot;Application software&quot;—the kind you deploy to a system using Chef or stick in a Docker container or somesuch—is expected to use vendored libraries and a vendored platform, the way e.g. Erlang releases do. Not just in development, but in production. This is why /opt exists.<p>It&#x27;s only once your software becomes &quot;system software&quot;—once it becomes something people expect to be a <i>stable, black-box part of the OS</i> rather than something they integrate into their solution—that you must pay attention to the versions of other &quot;system software.&quot;<p>OSes demand stability from system software for one simple reason: the ability to silently auto-update &quot;the OS&quot; in production to take out crashers and security vulnerabilities, without materially affecting the application software running atop it.<p>If you want your package to successfully participate in the OS&#x27;s zero-downtime auto-update magic, then your package needs to be stable and have stable deps. No new features, no breaking API changes, nothing that will break other system software that people are depending on in production.<p>But if you <i>don&#x27;t</i> have that requirement—if ABI-incompatible updates to your package just affect the <i>developers</i> consuming your library/tool, rather than <i>users</i> whose OSes suddenly break—then there&#x27;s no need to integrate with the OS.<p>Note that rvm, and rubygems or npm, and so forth, aren&#x27;t &quot;secondary OS package managers.&quot; They&#x27;re developer tools, for developing application software. The end result that real operations engineers will expect out of you is a blob (maybe a private package, maybe a container, maybe just a tarball) containing the platform, the libraries, and your code, baked together. Production systems should not be running rvm, or gem/npm install, to get your software&#x27;s deps installed!<p>---<p>An interesting consequence of this philosophy, though, is that there are many &quot;leaf packages&quot; in most distros that shouldn&#x27;t be system packages at all, but should rather be floating above the OS, consumed via a secondary &quot;application software manager&quot; that pulls down full pieces of self-contained vendored-deps software.<p>OSX almost has the right idea by dividing the world between a low-level Unix system (all system software; all involving stable-version interdependency), and &quot;application bundles&quot; that embed their own vendored Frameworks. But they don&#x27;t go far enough; there&#x27;s no such thing as a &quot;CLI application bundle&quot; which gets probed on Spotlight discovery to provide a new bin/ directory for your $PATH, the way GUI application bundles get probed to provide new file-type associations. If there was, they could move a lot of their own &quot;leaf nodes&quot; out into CLI bundles. (The &quot;Command Line Tools&quot; package containing gcc et al. is a prime candidate for a CLI bundle. It&#x27;s not system software; it&#x27;s its own vendored build environment!)<p>Despite what I said above, it might be perfectly sensible to run something <i>like</i> gem/npm on a production system—but only for requesting the &quot;leaf packages&quot; you&#x27;ll actually be using on that machine—both applications and utilities.<p>Such an &quot;application package manager&quot; <i>could theoretically</i> even do dependency-resolution—but only insofar as it would be doing it to optimize download time by breaking out things like &quot;foo-1.0/vendor/[someframework]-1.1.13-[exactsha]&quot; into its own slug so different apps&#x27; downloads could reuse it from cache. The result of running &quot;app install [foo]&quot; would still have to be a copy of foo-1.0 with its [someframework] vendored inside it, not a symlink or other such reference from foo to someframework. (Basically, if you get the idea, I&#x27;m talking about a cross between Homebrew Casks and Nix.)<p>If you twist your mind just right, container solutions like Docker <i>are</i> the &quot;application package manager&quot; I&#x27;m talking about. But they actually provide <i>too much</i> isolation to run a lot of important application software (games, for example), because they&#x27;re built under the assumption that you&#x27;re running <i>someone else&#x27;s</i> untrusted application software, and also on the assumption that the environment <i>above</i> the container isn&#x27;t itself a secure/ephemeral sandbox like a VM. It&#x27;d be pretty easy, though, to take the ideas from container management, and use them to create a one-true-tool for creating, deploying, and managing the lifecycle of &quot;releases&quot; of application software in an OS-neutral way. While rvm(1) shouldn&#x27;t be installed in production, appvm(1) could very well be.",1443209751

Erlang libs are either non-blocking or blocking doesn&#x27;t matter because it will handle millions of processes with little overhead.<p>3. Production ops - deploying and rolling back code in Erlang has tons of gotchas, but you can mostly change code and DB schemas on the fly in production, selectively or even run parts of the production load on your laptop to debug it. And you can deploy changes in small increments many times a day without affecting uptime.<p>4. Best part is failure recovery. In Akka, the node is a single OS process and single JVM. If you leak a file handle or some resource or lock and a thread blocks nothing will recover you until your OS process dies. Erlang is capable of killing processes everywhere, there is no internal global state. Even if you leak something like a file handle in a process, it will be cleaned up when the process terminates like a real OS process. Even if you leak something in ets/mnesia(the global storage), you can go ahead and clean it up from your erlang shell and production doesn&#x27;t have to stop. If you leak something in Java and you haven&#x27;t exposed specific interface to clean it, you will have to kill the JVM.",1443209336

Yes, but so does Haskell etc.&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s missing the point that Erlang/OTP (and therefore also Elixir) is attractive because it&#x27;s already a <i>complete package</i>. It&#x27;s the intersection of a lot of different, neat technologies that becomes magical.<p>Try to accomplish the same things in Haskell or Clojure or Go and you&#x27;ll find that you simply don&#x27;t have the same tools available to you, and often they cannot be built as well as in Erlang because the foundation wasn&#x27;t designed for it. And there&#x27;s always some piece missing.<p>For example, you can build an approximation of supervisor trees in Go, but since goroutines cannot be killed, you&#x27;re at the mercy of the runtime. (I also wonder if goroutines scale as well as Erlang&#x27;s.) Similarly, no one has actually built a functional, immutable, process-oriented call-by-name-and-signature RPC mechanism for Go, so you&#x27;ll have to invent your own. And so forth.<p>As a specific example, I was recently investigating OCaml to see if someone had implemented something similar to OTP. I found a couple of promising, nascent projects, but their activity all ended around 2009. Apparently nobody is doing it, even though the language seems damn near perfect for it. Never mind distributed processes; LWT is pretty weak even as an approximation of Go&#x27;s goroutines.<p>> [downtime] This doesn&#x27;t need to be a language feature ...<p>Erlang&#x27;s live code replacement changes how you mentally think about versioning, I think. Instead of designing every piece of your infrastructure to transparently transition to a new version — using load balancers, multiple processes accept()ing on the same port, and so forth — you get a first-class language construct. This also opens possibilities beyond code deploys, such as temporarily injecting tracing into a running program. Also not often mentioned is how powerful it is to be able to connect to a running process and run the REPL inside it. (Ruby comes close here, but it&#x27;s never been something you get for free.)",1443209163

A victim opens up a new browser (no HSTS from existing connections) and goes to search.com. An attacker MITMs this HTTP request and injects their own session cookies and then redirects to <a href=""https://search.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://search.com</a>. At this point, let&#x27;s assume full-domain HSTS kicks in and no more HTTP/MITM are possible.<p>Now the victim is on <a href=""https://search.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://search.com</a>, lock icon and cert are a-OK. But the user is signed in as attacker. The user might not notice this, and makes searches, which are now available to the attacker, in the attacker&#x27;s history.<p>Problem: Fix this, without overly relying on the victim noticing they are signed in as the attacker. After all, they just opened search.com for the first time and aren&#x27;t expecting to be signed in (though they are wary of HTTPS and do notice the green URL bar).<p>Perhaps it is slightly contrived and the answer really is &quot;Well, always look on a site to see if you&#x27;re logged in as someone else&quot;.

I don&#x27;t need to initialize them just yet.<p>>>You&#x27;re exposing your code to unnecessary bugs where you user the variable prematurely.<p>The compiler warns when you use uninitialized variable. Just don&#x27;t initialize them to random things, leave them uninitialized.<p>>>Variables tend to be declared further from their use, making it harder to find them and see their types.<p>I mean, I can see how that could be a problem but I don&#x27;t have blocks bigger than one screen so  I can alway see them anyway. I like short functions/blocks. It&#x27;s also way easier to visualize what is happening if I allocate memory in my brain for the variables so to speak.<p>>>The stack size argument is wrong, because variables aren&#x27;t necessarily on the stack, and non variable allocations may be put on the stack (i.e it&#x27;s neither necessary nor sufficient to predict stack use).<p>It might be technically wrong but the real problems are arrays as they are the only thing which could blow out the stack (especially in recursive functions) so yeah, I don&#x27;t see it as a problem although I imagine it could be for some.<p>>>You&#x27;re discouraged from creating intermediate variables that aid readability.<p>I am not discouraged. Again, maybe it sounds super strange to you but I am actually discouraged if I had to put them in the middle of the code logic as I find it ugly and I need to readjust my picture of what is going on once I encounter some new variable I didn&#x27;t know is going to be there when glancing at the block.<p>>>You&#x27;re discouraged from declaring your variables const, losing extra safety.<p>I think const is as good as useless in C when it comes to declaring variables. I don&#x27;t think it gives any extra safety it&#x27;s just more typing and additional pain.<p>>>All in all, it&#x27;s a terrible way to code.<p>I don&#x27;t know. I think you lost the perspective. One way or the other it won&#x27;t be a big difference and a lot of good code is written in the old/traditional style. You may think it&#x27;s worse but it is not terrible.",1443207699

It&#x27;s not the most efficient or most technically advanced mechanism for handling concurrency.<p>That being said-<p>> Without virtual machine support, doing concurrency is really just faking it<p>This is patently false, because it implies that:\n- A VM is necessary for &quot;real&quot; concurrency\n- (by deduction) Anything not utilizing an erlang-identical model is &quot;faking it.&quot;<p>> will result in significant bugs later on that are essentially impossible to debug<p>I&#x27;m going to need to see an anecdote or citation for this.<p>Personally-speaking, I have a much easier time (quickly) understanding the execution of event-loop-backed cooperative multitasking than high-level, arbitrarily-preempted threads.<p>Also - I cannot see any reason why Quasar for the JVM would be any easier or harder to debug (from a theoretical, not tooling or practical standpoint) than Erlang actors.<p>The nuances differentiating the two models aren&#x27;t great enough to merit bugs that you might see in one place or the other.

What these manufacturers want to do is, design some commodity hardware, put on the stuff consumers are demanding (Google&#x27;s services), but then load them up with other stuff (which many consumers would call bloatware or junk).<p>But how easy should one expect it to be to ship a phone? Seriously, 10 or 20 years ago, you not only had to make a lot of custom hardware design, but you had to have a lot of inhouse embedded software engineering. These days, most of this stuff is available off the shelf, and Chinese manufacturers can slap together a new phone and drop Android in it extremely quickly, all at low cost.<p>If there was no Android, and just two proprietary platforms (iOS + Windows, or iOS + Symbian), their situation would be even worse.<p>Android&#x27;s brand already has bad branding from fragmentation and security issues. Paradox of choice tends to drive conformity and commodification, so I&#x27;m not sure the situation would be much better otherwise.<p>If you want to launch consumer phone hardware and get lots of customers, IMHO, you should expect it to be hard and differentiating and have to put in enormous software work. I honestly don&#x27;t think Android manufacturers are going to standout on small software tweaks and packaging of apps.<p>If you&#x27;re an Android manufacturer and you think the key to standing out in innovation, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to come from skinning Android and replacing one of apps on the homescreen. Just IMHO, but this seems more like companies wanting to take shortcuts without putting in the hardwork that Apple or Google have made to convince users of the value of a custom platform.",1443207644

6316267,comment,6315664,6316073,4,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I disagree and believe there is more upside to this than downside. You certainly can&#x27;t say that the fact that different browsers and devices handle favicons differently is a standards issue. If you were to try to standardize this then we&#x27;d end up with either a very large and complex standard (close to what we unofficially have now) or a lack of innovation. Innovation isn&#x27;t the exact right word I&#x27;m searching for but what I&#x27;m getting at is that forcing vendors to use set sizes and naming conventions would detract from some of the small but important UI and even hardware differences in devices and browsers.<p>iOS had the retina display with mobile safari first, then came Microsoft&#x27;s metro interface which brought tiles and going forward we&#x27;re probably going to see many more devices and browsers that handle some aspects of web resources differently and for good reason. We can&#x27;t expect the web standards committees to be able to account for all of these advances as fast as they come about and I&#x27;d argue that&#x27;s exciting and good.<p>Furthermore I&#x27;d say web standards already do take care of this in the most elegant way I can think of. The <link> tag is totally standard and future proof when it comes to favicons. I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with adding a link tag with standard attributes to support multiple devices here. The purpose of a favicon is to associate a small image with a website or URL in general. Not all sites need the apple-touch icon or windows tile but some do. What we&#x27;re seeing here is an attempt to target specific browsers on specific devices for very specific cases. By and large the standard desktop browser favicon has never changed. When you take all that into consideration I think its actually quite reasonable for these different methods of specifying favicons to exist.<p>I&#x27;ll grant you that adding all that in your markup is ugly and having to think about which devices you want to target is a pain especially once you&#x27;ve decided on it and then have to start thinking about which markup to use and in what order.<p>Still, this isn&#x27;t a case where vendors are using proprietary markup to capture more of the market or doing anything &quot;evil&quot;. It&#x27;s more a case of using an existing standard to take advantage of a specific device capability. Standardizing the way web/markup languages are handled is good but trying to standardize favicons in this context seems like an awkward way of trying to standardize how a device and/or browser and/or OS handles its UI and is not good.<p>Edit: I can&#x27;t think of a good way we can standardize this but I am curious if there&#x27;s anyone out there that has a decent idea for how we can standardize how we specify favicons for the plethora of devices we have now and will continue to see going forward.",1378144694

There have been hundreds of attempts to reduce the complexity of development, starting in the &#x27;50s and continuing pretty much continually until today. And just as Fred Brooks describes in the book I linked, that kind of productivity increase doesn&#x27;t happen in software. And <i>won&#x27;t</i> happen in software.<p>You do get ways of better managing complexity. Look at object-oriented programming, for example. That&#x27;s a recent development, right? Sure, as long as you&#x27;re old enough to consider the 1970s to be &quot;recent.&quot; [2] Not me, thanks. ;)<p>The best you do get is a single problem being solved in a somewhat general manner. The CMS gives us a generic web site/blog. Square and others give us easy commerce integration. And so on: Specific common problems solved really well.<p>Yes, these are things that previously took many man-hours of time to create one-off versions of, but what happens is that people want more and more complex (and differentiated!) functionality in their web sites or apps.<p>And that differentiation is <i>by definition</i> not able to be packaged in bulk. As soon as it gets interesting, I don&#x27;t care how easy you&#x27;ve made the &quot;language&quot; that specifies it, you still need a programmer to implement it. Or someone who can think like one.<p>And most people not only don&#x27;t think like programmers, they firmly believe they <i>can&#x27;t</i> think like programmers, and so refuse to even try to learn how. Or at the very least they have an image that programming is dull or dry or boring.<p>There are still huge barriers to people entering programming en masse. And even if they did, it would be the lowest complexity jobs that would be harder to get -- the ones where the barrier to entry <i>is</i> really low.<p>I work tasks a few tiers of complexity above those jobs; I&#x27;m not worried about being replaced by a new wave of college graduates any time soon.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#History"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#Hi...</a>",1378144163

In my experience, they do not care about badges or rankings (Hacker Rank, Hacker Meter), nor do they have the time because they have actual gigs.<p>On that note, badges and rankings have little to do with performance. Technical skills are easy to find. Soft skills are not. Someone who finishes what they start, who will pick up the phone and actually call an employer when there is a problem rather than ignoring it altogether ..  Open source contributions are great, but, again, I&#x27;ve met some amazing open source developers who have poor social skills.<p>Rankings only tell half the story.

Plus, if sites do not disclose the ranking algorithm, it doesn&#x27;t mater anyway. Heck, I&#x27;ve been hired to write ranking algorithms that used trivial measures. The site didn&#x27;t care: They just wanted a ranking system. Their argument was that people don&#x27;t care. And in a way it&#x27;s true. I see how many people use search engines - not looking to find the right answer, just some sort of answer that they can mold to fit their needs.<p>Anyhow, I quit that gig.<p>So - How do you find the best hackers?<p>Solution:<p>You can&#x27;t through an open job board.

Estimates of the Guanche population at the time of the conquest range from 1200 to over 4000.<p>La Palma is over twice as big as El Hierro (708.32 km2 vs. 278 km2) and it seems to support better agriculture and easier access to the sea.

The account says that a tree could fill 20,000 tuns/day, which is about 20 million liters. This needs about 4 million square meters. Assuming an 80 meter high tree and 32 meters across (the size of a larger redwood tree) gives a cross section of 2,500 sq. meters. There&#x27;s no way these numbers are close to compatible.<p>3) Let&#x27;s assume the tree can capture an excess of 1 liter per sq. meter cross section, even though there&#x27;s no evidence that any tree can do that. Let&#x27;s assume also that a single tree has a cross section of 2,500 sq. meters. That&#x27;s 2,500 liters per day. Not bad, but people need about 2 liters per day as a minimum - and more if they do much activity. Even in this unlikely and extreme case, that&#x27;s only enough to provide basic water needs for 1,000 people.<p>The WHO says &quot;a minimum of 7.5 litres per capita per day will meet the requirements of most people under most conditions&quot;, so that&#x27;s 330 people. And no animals.<p>(Another estimate is to look at the amount of water in fog. A cloud has about 0.5 g of water/cubic meter. However, this is too complex for me to figure out, because I don&#x27;t know how much water you can extract with fog mining, I don&#x27;t know what a tree or other plant can extract, I don&#x27;t the wind speed, and I don&#x27;t know the capture area.)<p>4) Why use lead pipes to lead to the cistern? Since clay is good enough for the cisterns, what&#x27;s the advantage of using lead for those pipes?<p>Since each individual detail is not trustworthy, I find it hard to put any faith in the overall account. How are you certain that it isn&#x27;t a tall tale, with little to no basis in reality?",1378142222

To me this signifies, perhaps, a shift in the valley from investing in technology heavy companies toward more consumer branded companies. What I mean by this is if I look at Andy Grove and Intel (30 years ago), I dont think his accent prevented him from being successful. However today you need someone who is more US market oriented.

Each person should be able to live their life as he or she chooses without having force used against their person to coerce them to do things they otherwise would not do.<p>To interpret some American Libertarians views as &#x27;all government is bad and all private industry is good&#x27; shows an incredible amount of naivet. The author is inferring a general principle from specific arguments having missed the primary point. The reason you see so many specific arguments against government and for private industry in the modern day USA is not because anyone believes that government is inherently wrong but rather because what the government provides must necessarily be provided by the use of force. The government&#x27;s chief source of income is taxation which is the application of force to private citizens to extract money.<p>Most libertarians support the government providing a few limited key services such as national defense and operating a police force. Where you see libertarians start balking at government services is when they reach out beyond the scope of protecting an individual from the use of force by another.

I would need to think this through more, but I notice that in my local city, the place is awash in taxis - I think the numbers would have to be regulated better and people encouraged to use buses/trams/trains/bikes instead. Ideally, the public transport would be (somehow.. I admit) set up so that the need for individual point to point transport would only rarely be required...<p>Of course, this is easier said than done!",1378141483

Yes, people pattern match an accent but not just the words. For example, the content of what a woman with a strong French accent says will be diluted with thoughts of sexiness instead of being taken seriously (except Christine Lagarde :-)). In this sense, the validity of PG&#x27;s claim is not cut and dry. There are other factors.",1378141473

I met folks at Hacker School [3] who switched from econ, ME, OR, and other quantitative fields to CS, because you have more freedom to pursue ideas, can do more without being part of a huge team that makes you a tiny cog in a giant machine. And, by the way, it pays twice as well. But, it&#x27;s still not common to see people switch.</i><p>Because CS is seen as a bunch of unprincipled, flash-in-the-pan geeky bullshit by most people, not everyone has the talent to be a good programmer (the industry has too many already, the last thing the world needs is more mindless morons plugging libraries together without the foggiest idea of what is going on) and people pursue what interests them. CS has a bad reputation from both ends - the more pure subjects like Philosophy and Math view it as intellectually-inferior (my Analysis professor, who was probably at least 75, obtusely claimed that programming a computer is &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;trivial&quot;) and the more concrete, practical subjects such as Electrical, Civil and Mechanical engineering tend to make fun of the CS people (and harbor resentment towards them) for making millions off of websites that foster self-indulgent behavior while they design airplane engines, artificial hearts and power grids.",1378141269

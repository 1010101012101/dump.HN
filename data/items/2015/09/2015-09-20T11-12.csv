In the last, say, 2 years I have been working full-time, and I noticed how throwing house parties became harder being in my late-20s: people have tight schedules, need to commute early because of work etc. Nonetheless, with my partner, we threw a handful each year. We lived in shared house but it was big, with a backyard and ok neighbors. We would always have some kind of big dinner and then mostly gather around the fire outside, sometimes watching stuff with a projector on a canvas we would put on the back wall.
Although always a lot of effort, I really enjoyed it, it creates a nice and safe space so that people can be really open with each other, I have seen many people getting to know each other and &quot;relationships&quot; (work/feelings related) bootstrap.
We have recently moved to the UK, outside London, in a smaller house. I don&#x27;t know much of the people and the town, and I am observing on myself how I spend more time on the internet or watching movies. Maybe it&#x27;s not related to being in 2015, maybe it&#x27;s just that after 25 in modern societies it gets more difficult to get close to people.

Are the News / Tech / Gossip pages simply custom lists of people that are followed? Why do I want to use your lists instead of using my Twitter account, which I've already customized to include the people I'm most interested in following?<p>If your target audience is people don't twitter but might be into it, they're either going to end up moving on to actually using Twitter, or decide it's not for them. In either case, they won't keep coming back to your site.",1239631084

Journalists are different, have different taste, and find different things interesting.""<p>You might experiment with PR Matchpoint to find journalists who have written on similar topics in the past. The site lets you cut and paste in either your entire press release, or else your website copy, or your keywords. It will then return a list of journalists who have written on similar themes.<p>These guys presented at NY Tech last week. According to them, there isn't really any other way to do what they do because all of the other databases of journalists are sorted based on beat or a few keywords, but not the actual text of what the journalists are writing. I haven't actually tried the site myself yet, but I probably will fairly shortly.<p><a href=""http://www.prmatchpoint.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prmatchpoint.com/</a>",1239630680

The school would bend over backwards for me because of the LD issue, but I saw little difference from the EG part of things.  Mainly it seemed like they had no idea what to do with me.  For example: I was in a remedial English class in 8th grade and then bumped the next year into the Honors English class which I passed by the skin of my teeth.<p>PS: While I spent a few hours taking a lot of 1 on 1 tests I don't know if they did a real IQ test and I got over 160 or if it was a ""soft test"" and they used the same term.",1239630468

Do New Zealand ISPs block all connections to SMTP servers? If so, this is quite outrageous and would solve nothing. Relaying email and connecting to an SMTP server that generates email messages are <i>completely</i> different things.

It can be taught with computers in a constructionist manner, it can be taught straight from Euclid (the old ""traditional method""), it can be taught (poorly) with ""New Math"", or to use an example that should be familiar: it can be taught with bingo cards.<p>These are not all equivalent, obviously, but none has a monopoly on learning.<p>[Edit: I'd also point out that Japan and South Korea also have an extremely competitive and intensive educational environment (with correspondingly high rates of school refusal and suicide among students) and a huge amount of cultural buy-in that can't simply be transplanted. I believe these are much bigger factors in the relative performance of those countries than the differences in the content of their education.]",1239630374

I've made some progress on my own, but having a professor/teacher and marked stepping stones in a program is best for me.  I'm definitely an autodidact, but I know my limitations.<p>What is my motivation?<p>The times my mind is fully engaged and I've been able to make mental leaps are when I'm working on interesting problems.<p>I have taken a few distance learning math courses at an accredited university and I found myself very engaged and learned a lot.  But I found the format lacking:  for difficult subjects I am going to need a real connection to encourage me past difficult spots.",1246607914

If one is ""lucky"" for 20 years straight, then it's not luck, it's actual skill. Sure, if you have enough monkeys typing, one will type a Shakespeare's play, but that is just an academic example.

685764,comment,683807,685349,0,0,sho,,,"Hm. Well, I agree with your observations. But maybe they're more willing to suggest alternatives because they haven't invested so much into learning an alternate system? You would expect someone who has, say, spent the last 15 years becoming an expert on DB2 to refrain - even subconciously - from questioning the very fundamentals his career is built on. MySQL users may not be advanced but at least they are unbiased.<p>MySQL is not that bad, no. With proper knowledge it can do a lot, and beyond its limits, capably configured, I am not sure any RDBMS can help. Facebook is not developing Cassandra because they can't afford Oracle.",1246607669

It's obviously not some soft-core girl-on-girl porn she's seeing. It's obviously something far worse which is just really creepy. My first thought was child porn. I doubt that's what Microsoft intended but you gotta be careful suggesting something is REALLY bad or people will assume the absolute worst in many cases.",1246607615

Until that happens, iPhone will remain a market leader and developers will have to put up with XCode and Objective-C.""</i><p>Although the author says this, the fact that 18 new android handsets can be released in a year is one of the problems with both Android and, to some degree, Windows Mobile.<p>The iPhone OS isn't really revolutionary. Even their interface on their home screen is pretty simple, it's just a more rigid desktop metaphor, Apple dock and all. It's the hardware that truly stands out. The hardware features Apple's carefully thought out design and style, along with an incredibly well done multi-touch screen. The awesome hardware accompanying the incredibly polished and functional screen are really the biggest selling points of the iPhone that no one has matched yet.<p>It's the same win that Apple's laptops provide over the multitude of OEMs that produce other computers. But it's obvious that hardware design is more important to consumers than the development platform, thus developers are going to have to cope.",1246607595

Theoretical computer science turns me on way more than pure maths. But it firmly sounds as if you want to do it and you're willing to do it, and at 41, you've had enough life lessons to realise when something's a true goal. Go for it.<p>* admittedly, it wasn't a big hassle, since I was 18 and had a choice between continuing a half-decent job and going to uni. Uni, as the accepted path for people my age, wasn't exactly a hard choice. ;)",1246607219

685755,comment,683807,684142,0,0,drawkbox,,,"I should have clarified, I meant around 5GB per one type of data.  Maybe a table or dataset that needs to be merged.  For instance if you had a product database table that needed to be joined with another GB large or set of data at runtime.<p>At that point, even in RDBMS you have to stop with the joins and flatten. I have experienced these limits in Oracle and MSSQL around 20-30 million row tables.<p>Scalable fundamentals like database flattening, dimensional modeling etc are all what key value stores give you from the start.  But really a good mix works best or project specific, just saying in the future with TB, PB of data the JOIN is a historic remnant.<p>It is possible one day that RDBMS will be seen as one of those evil optimizations that we made in our small relative worlds at the time.",1246606966

It's not a compromise, not from this point of view at least.<p>It won't _seem_ to take longer either, though this is a more subtle point. When you wash dishes wanting to just get it over with and move on to the next thing you'll be aware of the time almost constantly. Every extra cup you missed the first time is an annoyance. If you pay attention on the other hand you're most likely to achieve ""flow"" - which is incredibly easy to achieve with such menial activities btw. So not only you'll wash the dishes in most likely the least time possible, you won't even be aware of that time passing.",1246606960

Just a little social cue to potentail respondents that they should check their rebuttal to ensure that the point they're refuting is actually contained in the text of the original.  Like this:<p><pre><code>  But if they did actually clone genetically engineered dinosaurs from mosquito DNA, 
  I'd prefer they did it on an island well off the mainland to ensure that

685748,comment,685001,685421,0,0,sho,,,"Funnily enough I actually like doing the dishes, and cleaning in general. Unlike almost everything else I ever seem to do, it's a simple task with an unambiguous ""end condition"", unambiguous and well-defined motivation, and instant payoff with a nice clean kitchen.<p>I like this passage from Iain M. Banks, which sums up my feelings well:<p><i>He walked for days, stopping at bars and restaurants whenever he felt thirsty, hungry or tired; mostly they were automatic and he was served by little floating trays, though a few were staffed by real people. They seemed less like servants and more like customers who'd taken a notion to help out for a while.<p>'Of course I don't have to do this,' one middle-aged man said, carefully cleaning the table with a damp cloth. He put the cloth in a little pouch, sat down beside him. 'But look; this table's clean.'<p>He agreed that the table was clean.<p>'Usually,' the man said. 'I work on alien - no offence - alien religions; Directional Emphasis In Religious Observance; that's my speciality... like when temples or graves or prayers always have to face in a certain direction; that sort of thing? Well, I catalogue, evaluate, compare; I come up with theories and argue with colleagues, here and elsewhere. But... the job's never finished; always new examples, and even the old ones get re-evaluated, and new people come along with new ideas about what you thought was settled... but,' he slapped the table, 'when you clean a table you clean a table. You feel you've done something. It's an achievement.'<p>'But in the end, it's still just cleaning a table.'<p>'And therefore does not really signify on the cosmic scale of events?' the man suggested.<p>He smiled in response to the man's grin, 'Well, yes.'<p>'But then, what does signify? My other work? Is that really important, either? I could try composing wonderful musical works, or day-long entertainment epics, but what would that do? Give people pleasure? My wiping this table gives me plea­sure. And people come to a clean table, which gives them pleasure. And anyway,' the man laughed, 'people die; stars die; universes die. What is any achievement, however great it was, once time itself is dead? Of course, if all I did was wipe tables, then of course it would seem a mean and despicable waste of my huge intellectual potential. But because I choose to do it, it gives me pleasure. And,' the man said with a smile, 'it's a good way of meeting people. So; where are you from, anyway?'</i>",1246606356

685746,comment,684990,685439,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"That's just silly. Just because you don't want to work on your car yourself, doesn't mean you ought to choose one with the hood welded shut. It should be obvious that ""can fix"" is short-hand for ""can caused to be fixed, either doing it yourself, or by cajoling or paying someone else to do it"".  Without the source, there is no option to fix it.<p>I'm not an Open Source or Free Software extremist, by any means, but there are real benefits to having the source code to important software for <i>any</i> user, even those who have never opened a text editor or seen a line of source code.  It may not matter for video games and the software that runs your TV.  But, there are a lot of areas where it should be the single most important factor in the decision-making process, even if the decision makers don't realize it.  Government, for example, probably ought to exclusively run on Open Source software, or at least only buy from vendors that provide the source and a license that allows in-house fixes in the event the company goes under or is unable or unwilling to fix security vulnerabilities or interop problems.  Many large companies insist on ""dead man switch"" arrangements wherein they get the source if the software vendor goes under.  A free software license is just the logical conclusion.",1246605689

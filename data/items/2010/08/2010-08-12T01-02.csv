You're going to a meeting with a group of individuals building startups... they will want to talk about theirs and you will want to talk about yours. Share your product, get them interested in it, and get some feedback on ways to expand/improve. You don't have to implement the ideas right away, but consider what kind of influence they might have on your product. If anything, print out a few cards and hand them out!

Your Yahoo essay seems consistent with what I've noted.  The Viaweb/Yahoo Store thing was very good in the late '90s but they haven't changed much since then and it's very dated now.  I think they're coasting on the revenue, which I imagine is slipping away to eBay, Amazon, Shopify, etc.",1281578256

If we can still open <i>any</i> documents from our time period in 200 years, we'll be able to open that old LaTeX document of yours, because it's just ASCII (or Unicode in the case of XeLaTeX).

1596914,comment,1596607,1596855,0,0,mrshoe,,,"No, it's not. That gets at the very essence of my original comment.<p>One of the assertions in the article is that a hacker culture is a necessary ingredient for a successful technology company. I see Apple as a counterexample to this argument. And it's a counterexample that shouldn't be ignored. Apple is driven by design (industrial design, product design, graphic design). They think about products, not technology. They often invent new technologies to enable their products, but that's <i>very</i> different from thinking primarily about technology (a mistake, I would argue, that Google is guilty of frequently).<p>Taking as an example a project like Google Wave, I would even go as far as to say that a strong hacker culture and an obnoxious elitist culture of hiring only the best programmers can be <i>serious detriments</i> to a technology company. YMMV, but, culture-wise, I'd much rather build (and work for) an Apple than a Google.<p>Edit in reply to your reply: I thought it was <i>any company that needs to have good software.</i> But even so, surely Apple doesn't pay significantly more than Google (a hacker-centric company) and surely they're in roughly the same domain (iOS/Android, iAd, etc.). I think the real problem is in your next sentence: <i>Otherwise you can't attract good programmers to work in a suit-centric culture.</i> That's a big false dichotomy. Sure, suit-centric technology companies will fail. And hacker-centric technology companies sometimes succeed. I think Apple shows that a culture that is neither suit-centirc nor hacker-centric is the best option of all. If many of your YC companies are trying to build great technology companies, they should take that to heart.",1281578011

How could Microsoft be ""dead"" as PG claims in another essay ?<p>The key to this puzzle is that PG uses ""death"" in a figurative, not literal sense, to mean irrelevance, especially a fade to irrelevance from a previously dominant, direction setting, position  not complete physical extinction.<p>If you prefer, read it as ""irrelevance spiral"" and you would at least be reacting to what he intended to say vs what you understood by some overly literal reading. ""At Yahoo this irrelevance spiral started early"" can still be rebutted, but it needs a serious argument to do so.<p>As he said in his ""Microsoft is dead"" essay.<p>""I already know what the reaction to this essay will be. Half the readers will say that Microsoft is still an enormously profitable company, and that I should be more careful about drawing conclusions based on what a few people think in our insular little ""Web 2.0"" bubble. The other half, the younger half, will complain that this is old news.""<p>Replace Microsoft with Yahoo and this is what you are saying. MS has great market share, lots of smart researchers and many conferences for programmers using its technology and so on. All that doesn't avoid the fact that MS is a shadow of what it used to be in the nineties in terms of technological dominance.<p>Some of  your other points  have some merit (but their impact is lessened by your tone imho).<p>I  am all for strong debate and argument (it enriches us all) and PG shouldn't be allowed to get away with sloppy thinking, but you have to <i>show</i> that the thinking is sloppy. And the first step in rebutting an argument is to understand what was really said.<p>As for whether Yahoo is really hacker friendly, the best way to find this out is to talk to some hackers  who work (or have worked) at Yahoo. I am sure there are many people om HN who have worked/did work there. (strlen for example)<p>From his comment<p>""Much of the knowledge did diffuse to rest of the organization and it's important to note that along side the ""dot-com-wannabe-millionaire-vesting-in-peace"" crowd the essay describes, there was plenty of genuine technical talent (anyone who has worked there can attest to presence and influence of hackers).<p>Unfortunately, for many reasons, that talent has slowly bled out. There was also a great amount of friction between Search and rest of the organization e.g., resistance (by Search engineers) to dog-fooding of what was often inferior technology. Search was, however, able to maintain a different platform, remaining on Linux, with their own platform/software stack, but were some ""wtf"" moments like porting and forcing the adoption of a custom user space locking library from FreeBSD when Linux already had futex (on the other hand, the fact there was a custom locking library built in a ""media company"" does say something).<p>The other key mistake made is that they would position bright, capable new hires in areas that weren't directly correlated to revenue and treated as cost centers.""<p>This <i>sounds</i> like a company making mistakes with respect to technology.<p>(EDIT: See also tailrecursion's comment on his experience when he cae to Yahoo from Inktomi  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1596797"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1596797</a>)<p>(These are just anecdotes and not made to argue a point)I have friends on the Yahoo search team and from what they tell me, they did get crushed in terms of search quality by Google and though they caught up later (though not completely), they could never recover the lost ground in marketshare.<p>I know someone who argued at an internal  ""strategy conference"" that Yahoo needed to close the technology gap with Google or they would lose Search to Google and was completely ignored (He is still at Yahoo btw, though he switched to being a full time manager as a matter of survival).",1281576797

This project seemed to undergo huge troubles, and I wonder if it was ever completed in any real sense, because I heard so little about it, and everything I heard suggested disaster.<p>Honestly I don't know if the fruits of Panama -- such as improved auctions for ads on search result pages, which is a critical thing -- were ever deployed.  But a couple years later they made the Microsoft deal.  Over the last couple years, select people at Y! have moved on to Google, and many many others are now at Microsoft.",1281575468

Note: I am not a Yahoo employee or corporate shill.<p>1. ""At Yahoo this death spiral started early.""<p>Apparently this death spiral took TWELVE YEARS (the WWW is 20 years old), and Yahoo is still #1 (or #2) in terms of total properties on the web. How is this a death spiral?<p>2. ""If there was ever a time when Yahoo was a Google-style talent magnet, it was over by the time I got there in 1998.""<p>Are you kidding me? You're implying all the current Yahoo engineers are idiots? Then how come each piece of code they release is revered, lauded and used by everybody?<p>Speaking of talent: Yahoo got best paper at EVERY data-related conference in 2010. No single lab(Google,MS) or university(Stanford etc) has ever done this. Clearly you can achieve this without talent, pg!<p>3. ""In the software business, you can't afford not to have a hacker-centric culture. Probably the most impressive commitment I've heard to having a hacker-centric culture came from Mark Zuckerberg, when he spoke at Startup School in 2007.""<p>Which company is responsible for inventing the term ""Hack Day"": Yahoo. Which is the only company to _promote_ hacking culture to students? Yahoo. Yahoo != Hacker-friendly? WTFFF!!! (edit:goog does soc, but it doesnt have engineers travel around the world teaching kids hands-on like yahoo  does)<p>4. Google and Apple are shiny and get all the attention. Yahoo's the internet's underbelly. It's audience may not be SF hipsters, but they exist and there are a lot of them. Just because they're not like you doesn't mean they dont exist. Just because Yahoo doesnt cater to you doesn't mean it doesn't exist.<p>5. pg's product got hosed after inclusion into Yahoo. This happens. Reading a Yahoo critique from pg is like reading a Google critique from Evan Williams (Blogger), or a Google critique from the Dodgeball guys. It's a biased opinion.<p>6. It's a miracle Yahoo has survived for so long despite being criticized by the media /market for more than half its lifetime. The only other company that has had it worse was Apple, when they fired Steve Jobs. Yahoo doesnt have a Steve Jobs, and has been managed badly, but the engineering is SO GOOD that it STILL does a good job overall.",1281575440

There wasn't much on the page about what it was all about when I signed up. My only real conference experience have been things like Shmoocon, where you go and network while listening to speakers.<p>Well, tonight I look at the agenda and I find out what DC Startup Weekend is all about. It sounds really great, except, I'm not sure I'll get much out of it. I've already got a product I'm working on, www.unscatter.com. I suppose I could go there and pitch it, but with a 7 week old infant I'm not in the position where I could just drop my job and dive 100% into it as a startup now.<p>This is why I've been slowly working on it in my very little spare time, basically trying to bootstrap it myself. I'd love to sit and talk to someone about the direction I'm headed, which is what I was hoping to get out of this weekend. However, that doesn't look like that's something I'd get.<p>So, I'm trying to figure out if there's any value in attending. My wife suggested I go Friday night and check it out, which since I've already purchased the ticket I probably will do. Just curious if anyone here had any feedback or ideas of what I could get out of attending?",1281575327

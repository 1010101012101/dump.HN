201628,story,,,1,0,ideas101,"C Corp Versus S Corp",,"Under the best of circumstances, incorporating a business can be a complicated and confusing process.<p>Wouldn't it just be easier if you could keep some of the benefits of a sole proprietorship while getting some of the advantages of a traditional corporation? Well, maybe you can.<p>It's called an S-corporation and for many small businesses it provides the perfect hybrid between a sole proprietorship and a corporation. However, S-corps are also subject to certain limitations that may restrict your company's activities. The bottom line is that if it's time to move beyond a sole proprietorship or partnership structure, you need to know the facts about your options.<p>C-Corporations<p>When most people think about corporations, they actually have C-corporations in mind. A C-corporation is a business entity that is capable of maintaining a life of its own, at least in the sense that it is allowed to retain its own profits. The corporation is taxed on profits at corporate rates and dividends are taxed to the company's shareholders.<p>It's also important to not that C-corporations are subject to more formal requirements than sole proprietorships, partnerships, and even S-corporations. These requirements include (but may not be limited to) annual reports, boards of directors, and federal reporting.<p>C-corporations are especially attractive to small businesses that are currently profitable or plan to be profitable in the near future because the company's owner can avoid claiming the business' profits on his personal tax return and instead allow profits to be taxed to the corporation.<p>S-Corporations<p>Unlike C-corporations, S-corporations are pass-through business entities. This means that all of the company's income is passed through to the company's shareholders who then claim it as personal income rather than corporate income. This eliminates the ""double taxation"" of profits that are taxed at the corporate level and then again when dividends are passed on to shareholders.<p>S-corporations are subject to more requirements than sole proprietorships and partnerships, although these requirements are not quite as stringent as they are for C-corps. However, to classify as an S-corp, the company cannot have more than 35 shareholders and is limited to domestic capitalization.<p>S-corps are an appealing option for small business owners who want the advantages of a corporation (e.g. not being personally liable for the company's debts and liabilities) without the additional burden of requirements involved with a traditional corporate structure.<p>Regardless of whether you decide to become a C-corporation or an S-corporation, you should know that as the owner, you cannot simply take a draw on profits. Instead, you will need to establish a wage for yourself and withhold standard payroll taxes and deductions.<p>Source: http://www.gaebler.com/C-Corp-Versus-S-Corp.htm",1211936178

I think each of us is just taking a different view of the words ""stop coding"".  I think it means ""for a few hours so you can get all of the other stuff done"", while you seem to think it means ""and never fire up vim/emacs again in your life"".  Obviously, I'm not telling anyone to stop coding forever (or even for more than a few days).

I do not think that Cambridge tells all its’ residents that they <i>should be smarter.</i> But it does send that message the average person within the MIT (and presumably Harvard, which I know less about) community.<p>My first company was in educational software and I interacted some with the Cambridge public school system.  Some schools were pretty connected to the ambitious community, and others were almost completely separate.  In other words, there are pockets of people, perhaps a majority, that are not in the ambitious community and do not perceive the ambitious community message.  I would bet that in these pockets, there are sub-pockets, each with their own messages.<p>Now Cambridge is a weird place with an unusually concentrated group of the same type of people, and I agree that I haven’t at least found any place else like it.  But it is just a pocket of Boston, albeit a bigger pocket than some of the other ambitious communities in other cities.  And as Paul pointed out, Cambridge is not Boston.  So he is really not talking about cities.<p>Again, he is talking about specific communities within cities.  There are probably even other ambitious communities in Boston (in its financial district, for example), where the message is not <i>you should be smarter,</i> but something more along the lines of <i>you should be richer.</i>  And I’m pretty sure there is another, separate, local politics community, where the message is more like the DC message described (on a smaller scale).  (My wife worked in a state agency, and we have friends who were in the legal community there.  I myself was the treasurer of a city council campaign.)<p>So, in sum, I agree there are messages within communities.  But I wouldn’t generalize to entire cities.  The reason I think people get confused is because particular types of these communities only exist in certain cities, and in sometimes just one.  The messages Paul describes are in the communities he is more likely to happen upon given his network and interests, within those cities.  Yet there are certainly other communities within those cities with other messages.  These other communities, in the aggregate, probably account for the vast majority of people in a given city.",1211933171

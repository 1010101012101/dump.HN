Whether it's Armani jeans, Calvin Klein boxers or Gucci handbags, people are willing to spend a little more because of perceived value or identity with the brand, even though they can get the same product for less at Banana Republic or GAP.<p>However unlike Apple, the likes of Louis Vuitton and Gucci do sell high-end luxury items at ridiculous prices, often unique bespoke pieces, which ordinary consumers would never be able to afford.

4734452,comment,4733972,4733972,21,0,neya,,,"This is seriously good news. What many people don't realize is how powerful Android is. Open Source doesn't mean shitty quality software, contrary to popular belief. Android can do so many things that other Operating systems still cannot provide. All Android needs is some time, and some iterations and no one can even dream of killing it (like many plan to). Because, if anything history has taught us, Open Source will eventually win the war.<p>I own a 42"" Sony Bravia LCD TV. When I first purchased it, I got a hard copy of the GNU/GPL license. Wondering, I did a quick search and found out that my TV runs on Linux! Now, here's the sad part - Since I'm somewhat techie, I know my TV is powered by Open Source software. But the average end consumer doesn't know and doesn't care much, he just wants a good TV. So, the main area where open Source is weak at is marketing.   And this too, is only a matter of time, till it catches up, I believe.<p>Imagine if the Linux foundation advertised on TV like Apple did, for their Mac vs PC commercials? Then the average consumer would probably care. If you have a good product, you should let people know about it. Sadly, even the Nexus 10 and Nexus 4 have poor marketing in this context (Michael Arrington wrote a wonderful article on this[1]).<p>One day, Android will reach 95%+, and I will live to watch it happen and I will tell my kids and my grandchildren without hesitation - ""This is the future.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/31/hey-google-your-nexus-7-marketing-images-look-like-crap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/31/hey-google-your-nexus-7-mar...</a>",1351886248

4734446,comment,4728962,4730709,1,0,scott_s,,,"That's my point, though. The mentality of ""this muscle needs  to be worked, then this one..."" is a <i>bodybuilder</i> mentality. It's not shared by strength athletes in powerlifting, Olympic lifting, strong man, and the much newer CrossFit. When I lift, I focus on movements, not muscle groups. I focus on big, compound movements like squats, deadlifts or clean and press, not on specific muscles.<p>Basically, bodybuilding is concerned with aesthetics, while the strength sports are concerned with performance. When I train, my motivation comes from the challenge. Can I deadlift 405 for 5 reps? Can I hit a new personal record of 435? It's a question of raw capability: what are the limits of what I can do? When you get into high rep rangs with compound movements, it becomes an issue of anaerobic endurance: can I squat 235 for 20 reps, or will the pain and exhaustion be too much?",1351886175
4734445,comment,4734208,4734208,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"One of the things we did, before we put solar panels on our house, was a power survey. We actually measured the power draw of our house every day for a year by reading the power meter and keeping a notebook (great for power disputes as well :-). We discovered that we were using 23.2 kWh per day, or just under 1kW. But like the author our peak loads were higher (we don't have air conditioning or a pool so those power suckers aren't an issue). We also found that a 5.5kW generator would cover our needs.<p>So when the wiring was under modification for a kitchen remodel, we had the electrician install a transfer switch on which we put our 10 most 'useful' circuits. Then when the power went out we could fire up the generator outside, plug it into the transfer switch and transfer power from the AC 'mains' to the generator.<p>That works fine but you have to be careful because the power generated by Home Depot generator is pretty crappy power. The computer systems were protected by using a UPS system that used AC primary power for battery charging and ran the load off an inverter. At some point I'll find a datacenter throwing out an old AC line conditioner and I'll get that.",1351886169

4734430,comment,4733972,4734264,2,0,bunderbunder,,,"Yup.  In fact, that's exactly how I was proposing we might redefine it.<p>It's a worthwhile way to look at it because simply having apps to do certain things isn't really what defines a smartphone - feature phones were letting users buy and install BREW or J2ME apps for a long time.  This includes all the basic apps that people tend to expect on their phones nowadays, like Facebook.<p>So, apps being nothing new, the line's always been a bit blurry.  Using what OS the phone runs as a distinguishing criterion works fine, of course, and it's probably the most sensible one overall.  But distinguishing based on the way people interact with the device, regardless of what OS it runs is also illuminative.<p>In this case, for example, it would seem to explain why the market for 3rd-party software (the thing that's supposed to be the heart and soul of smartphones) is so tiny on Android despite it being far and away the biggest smartphone platform.  Perhaps it's the case that, regardless of what they're capable of, a huge percentage of the Android devices out there are still being used as if they were feature phones.",1351885896

I just phrased it that way in response to your absurd statement, a fact that should be painfully obvious.  Theo is the guy in charge.  He is the guy building the software.  He would be the guy signing the software.  When Bob owns the build server, he can trick Theo into signing his malicious binaries.  Do you think Theo goes through each binary with a disassembler after he compiles them and ensures that the generated binaries are kosher?  All PGP would get me is the ability to know Theo signed it.  If it was tampered with during the build, or post-build, pre-signing, then I'm boned.<p>That is the same situation we currently have.  If Theo's machines get owned, we're boned.  If they don't, we can easily verify that the sha-256 hash of the files on my hard drive, post download from wherever, match those that Theo built.<p>At the end of the day, you are drawing a line about where to stop verifying and start trusting.  The fact that you are download binaries as opposed to source means you are trusting the openbsd developers, not just personally, but in that they have secured access to the code and build process to prevent tampering.  So then the only part you aren't trusting is the distribution mechanism, which ssh keys and sha-256 hashes allow you to verify, rather than needing to rely on trust.",1351884700

Prior to that level of escalation there could be a knock down drag out fight but it would be perhaps less likely to result in someone dying. Further, when the stakes become 'life or death' because someone has a gun, the responses take on a level of urgency and desperation that they would not have at lower threat levels.<p>So from the perspective of an analogy, corporations don't have 'blood' they have money, which is an analog for blood. And up to the point where they are arguing about this and that the total amount of money that is at stake is constrained by the companies involved deciding not to do business with each other. But a lawsuit can drain a disproportionate amount of money out of the 'target' (and the instigator). This 'escalates' the problem because what is at risk is higher. And, like an individual, when you threaten a company with more serious damage, their willingness to respond with more harm goes up significantly, if they feel like they are fighting for their life they will do things that normally would be considered 'too risky.'<p>So as an analog, the handgun and a lawsuit are escalation to the conflict which can result in much greater harm.",1351884643

You can only find that boundary by running into it a few times and recognizing where it is. It gets much, much more complex as you grow in size because the fraying can happen as part of how two individuals interact. The more individuals you have, the riskier it is to assume the boundary is farther out, and thus the safer it is to constrict using process; there are interpersonal boundaries on top of your personal comfort zones.<p>If you don't need the habits and consistency, then you don't need them.

It makes more sense to move that off your primary data store if possible.<p>I do find that making databases smarter about the data they hold can really provide some great optimizations.

I'm currently working as part of a 2 person team that consists of myself (the main programmer) and an artist. We've fleshed out a lot of the artwork and core mechanics, and you can even play a complete multiplayer game locally. While not public, the game has received very positive feedback from the communities we have shared it with. The problem is that this game was destined to be played with friends over the internet.<p>I know what I need, a programmer familiar with RESTful web services, AWS, client/server architecture and network libraries. Getting connected with the right developer has proved to be very challenging however. We even hired a contractor at one point, but were left with less than satisfactory results. Were hoping to find someone that can eventually be as excited about this project as we are. Wed love to share our enthusiasm and get this game published. Ive tried a lot of different approaches, but Im at a loss for where I should look?

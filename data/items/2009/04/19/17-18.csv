The purpose of my project is to do that 90% for you, and to do it thoroughly.<p>For example, saving the simulation data to a file. Or being able to rewind the simulation and change something in its world, and then running the simulation from that point and watching what that change will cause. Or having the machine calculate two different ""possible futures"" concurrently.<p>These are the basic features, and I know it doesn't sound like something very complicated, but if you think it's simple, I challenge you to find me a framework that allows to work comfortably with simulations.<p><i>What sort of game theory problems are you thinking about</i><p>Generally, whatever you want. I'm not a game theorist, but here's what I coded a year ago: A hundred computer players play 50 rounds of the prisoner's dillemma with each other, and they get paired randomly after every session. Every player had a certain strategy chosen from a pool of strategies. When a player lost a lot of points, the computer replaced it with a new player with a random strategy.

Scaling up existing capabilities to be slightly better reaches a limit at some point; increasing capabilities does not.<p>Consider games for an example of poorly invested resources. The graphics have improved dramatically in video games between the era of Chrono Trigger ('95) and now. The quality of the games has declined. These two trends are linked together. Now that the budget for a game is in the 7- and 8-digit range, business people have creative control over games, and games are more likely to be designed by committee. Thus, they end up sucking. Improving the graphics will not solve this problem, but there's still demand for high-quality games that is not being met through traditional channels.",1240162606

569569,comment,569175,569175,0,0,jerf,,,"One of the things I would consider a basic criterion for being able to call yourself an ""independent thinker"" is coming to the realization that when people think for themselves, they come to different conclusions. Which leads to a number of obvious conclusions, including: While ""the sheeple"" may not have the truth, by necessity the majority of the ""independent thinkers"" can't either, and you can't measure how independently someone is thinking by looking at what they believe.<p>There is no single monolithic ""the sheeple"", and it is possible that low-carbers are simple a sheeple that were told to buy a book instead of watch a show like Oprah.<p>I say this as someone who at least intellectually is very sympathetic to the ""low carb"" nutritional picture; I don't think it entirely corresponds to reality, but the old-school ""low-fat"" diet seems outright wrong. (By ""old school"", I mean the old dietary standards that treat fat as a single monolithic entity. Newer stuff is getting more nuanced and, I believe, more correct, at the cost of being very difficult to describe to people in detail.)<p>But going back to my main point, if you still measure the ""independence"" of somebody's thought by what they believe, you are not your own thinker; you've simply chosen a different crowd of sheeple to run with. Nobody's really immune to this, and by this standard I have seen precious few truly independent thinkers. (Even some people who have dedicate great time to an ""independent thinker"" shtick almost invariable slip in some belief touchstones into their definition of independent thought, whether or not they realize it. I am not thinking of anybody in particular here; I've seen this from many such people. (I'm not <i>quite</i> a hypocrite on this point; the first sentence of this post is more of a definition of what I consider an independent thinker than a touchstone belief, and I freely acknowledge the existence of other useful definitions... but I'm certainly slicing things awfully fine here... but I realize it.))<p>This may not be directly related to the original article, but it is certainly indirectly related.",1240162006

For example, Breyer was (IIRC) the founding CEO of In-Q-Tel [1], the CIA's venture capital arm founded by Gilman Louie.  Indeed, some think that Facebook is also funded by In-Q-Tel.  Because In-Q-Tel makes a combination of public and secret investments, it's not the sort of thing that would get covered on TechCrunch.<p>If one considers the data mining and correlation Facebook obviously has in the works, one might think that the CIA is using the vast amounts of data as a staging ground for techniques being employed in the recently black bagged Total Information Awareness program [2] started by DARPA and initially headed by (I shit you not) John Poindexter [3].  One might even argue that Mark Zuckerberg is so blase about potential acquirers because, indeed, the company will never allow itself to be acquired.  One would probably be derided as a conspiracy theorist, however.  :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Awareness_Office"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Awareness_Office</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Poindexter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Poindexter</a>",1199282261

I am not involved in RoR, so I don't know much about his technical claims, but I think his description of the consulting business and the fate of languages is brilliant.<p>I have seen this type of group think and dumbing down in the research world for many years now. I suppose it has a similar form in consulting as well. The world is not kind to the truth seeking individual, especially when that individual announces their intentions. The best one can do is to be wise about what battles to fight and to accept that there will always be some waste and fraud.",1199281657

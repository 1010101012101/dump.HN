It&#x27;s kind of like checking for your chair for a thumb tack, when you work in an office of pranksters -- if there isn&#x27;t a thumb tack, was there any benefit to checking?  Maybe, but you probably wouldn&#x27;t say that if there was.  If the standard model fell, there would be implications that we could probably engineer around up to and including utilizing nonlinear aspects of particle interactions to build computers with.  But alas, it confirmed the model.<p>Also the standard model has implications on the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which in turn have implications on the likelihood that we get clobbered by a random piece of space rock.  Of course even if we did know this to a better degree...it&#x27;s unclear whether that&#x27;s a benefit or not.

Innate talent left aside, whether an author wannabe&#x27;s book sells well or not entirely depends on his willingness to promote it by showing up at events and bookstores.<p>As such, you&#x27;re just as well off -- and more often than not, better off -- relying on friends for feedback and copy-editing, self-publishing an ebook, and reaching out to your audience directly through mostly online channels.<p>(I worked in a brick and mortar bookstore, and have been watching the situation degrade over the years ever since.

The point of &quot;not supporting&quot; a browser, is to avoid tedious and time consuming testing of said browser, because CSS and JS works differently in every browser (although close to the same in webkit browsers like chrome and safari).<p>>I&#x27;ve literally only ever heard this sort of ridiculous rhetoric from people who&#x27;ve never suffered through retroactively having to go back and support additional platforms.<p>Again, your arguments might apply to a OS application, but not to web browser &quot;applications&quot;.<p>Generally, I also subscribe to the mindset of: make it right for one OS. Instead of: make it shit for all OSs, but usable.<p>Finally. Going out of your way to support platforms that _might_ be used, for an application that you don&#x27;t really know if people will use in the first hand, is absolutely idiotic.<p>You need to know how, why and if people actually will use it, before spending time and money on supporting multiple platforms/browsers.<p>Just to finish of,<p>>I&#x27;ve literally only ever heard this sort of ridiculous rhetoric from people who&#x27;ve never suffered through...<p>I&#x27;ve literally only heard this from people that have never developed for multiple platforms, and expect that &quot;once it works on X, it must work on Y&quot;.

becomes:<p><pre><code>  public JObject ToJson() => return new JObject() { [&quot;x&quot;] = X, [&quot;y&quot;] = Y };
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s cool! Next comes the null-conditional operators:<p><pre><code>  public static Point FromJson(JObject json)
  {
     if (json != null &&
         json[&quot;x&quot;] != null &&
         json[&quot;x&quot;].Type == JTokenType.Integer &&
         json[&quot;y&quot;] != null &&
         json[&quot;y&quot;].Type == JTokenType.Integer)
     {
         return new Point((int)json[&quot;x&quot;], (int)json[&quot;y&quot;]);
     }
     return null;
  }
</code></pre>
Becomes...<p><pre><code>  public static Point FromJson(JObject json)
  {
     if (json?[&quot;x&quot;]?.Type == JTokenType.Integer &&
         json?[&quot;y&quot;]?.Type == JTokenType.Integer)
     {
         return new Point((int)json[&quot;x&quot;], (int)json[&quot;y&quot;]);
     }
     return null;
  }
</code></pre>
The check against JTokenType.Integer is just to avoid a casting exception. The null checks are just to avoid null exceptions. I wonder if the compiler could ever handle something like &#x27;this if you can, else null&#x27;, without actually having any exceptions getting throw and caught underneath:<p><pre><code>  public static Point FromJson(JObject json) => 
      return new Point((int)json[&quot;x&quot;], (int)json[&quot;y&quot;]) ?: null;</code></pre>",1416042197

They provide just enough of the kernel interface to a kernel device or filesystem driver to allow that driver to be linked in with other code to form a user-space process.

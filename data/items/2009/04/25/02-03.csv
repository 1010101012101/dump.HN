Go to Guitar Center and say you have a home recording studio and you need some acoustic foam and some bass traps (for the corners). Depends on your room, but $500 will buy you a lot of foam.<p>Basically you want to break up the standing waves between parallel reflective surfaces. Hardwood floors are the worst culprit, along with windows. A sofa helps a lot. So do big heavy wall hangings if you're into that.<p>Lastly, don't put your speakers in the corners or right back against the wall. It makes them sound boomy and results in muddy bass. The same is true if they're too near the floor. Also, try soundonsound.com for tips on acoustic improvement. Learn your room first: if you can make cheap speakers sound better then so will the pricey ones.<p>Spend most of the money on speakers. If you absolutely must have control over the tone color via an equalizer, Manley is a good choice.",1240627498

Instead of aiming to learning a programming language or something more, try applying the knowledge you already have and come up with a small web-app that does something (anything! small or big). As you walk this path of learning by doing, you will learn a lot more than you might think you've learned after reading a book.\nKeep a tap on good tutorials and inspirational articles - try shmashingmagazine, nettuts, psdtuts, thinkvitamin... etc<p>After done with say, PHP also try getting a taste of MVC, try CodeIgnitor...<p>I notice no mention of MySQL or other databases mentioned by you.... do learn them too, after all you would be playing around with data :) presenting it in different ways.",1240626837
578512,comment,578257,578439,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"If you have some money to spend and you really care about the sound^, you'll get the most bang for your buck by going to a professional music store and buying the kind of gear used in studios. Strangely (or not), you'll be hard put to find singe channel/speaker cables costing more than $50 in any recording studio unless it's in a huge room needing a long run.<p>I know nothing about your home of course, but when it comes to speakers you basically want them to be heavy and have big woofers. Many studio monitor speakers are powered, with an amp built into the speaker cabinet. In practice, this usually gives better results than a separate amplifier. Mackie Truth monitors will fill an average room and are very accurate for about $1000. At the higher end, Genelec and ADAM are considered the truly desirable names to have. I particularly love the sound (and look) of KRK speakers. If using a subwoofer, 18 inches is fine. More is for reinforcement, not fidelity.<p>Buy good stands which you can fill with sand to damp vibrations. Speakers should be around the same height as your head in the room's sweet spot, and basically form a triangle with your head as the third point. The bigger the sweet spot, the better the speaker.  You must have carpet; a bare wood floor defeats the purpose.<p>Nor do I know what gear you own, but prefer things which offer 'balanced outputs' - they reject interference and electrical noise far better. If you like records, get a technics SL1200 turntable and an Ortofon needle, for about $1500 altogether. If it's good enough for the world's best DJs, it's good enough for you. CD players from Marantz or Denon are excellent. Ask in the store about your mixing/source selection options, or we'll be here all day :-)<p>^ First, ask yourself honestly if looks matter. I love the look of studio gear, but that's because of my background as a sound engineer. Not everyone shares my utilitarian sensibility.",1240626604

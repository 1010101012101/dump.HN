If you&#x27;ve ever watched a &quot;real housewive of ...&quot; episode, those wacky ladies are <i>constantly</i> hosting charity events and provide a pretty good example of how this works:<p>1) Get a really good tax accountant and lawyer.<p>2) Establish a charity (in the U.S. they&#x27;re called 501(c)(3) organizations and have various laws about how they operate. Dedicate it to &quot;Cancer Research&quot; or &quot;Helping Orphans&quot; or whatever.<p>3) Set yourself up as the head of the charity, give yourself a respectable, but not over the top salary. This is the &quot;organizational overhead&quot; you often hear about.<p>4) Recruit a bunch of free volunteers concerned about your cause and host a charity event. Well done theme parties can bring in the most money. Include a donation envelope in case people can&#x27;t come but still want to &quot;support your cause&quot;.<p>5) Collect money. Make sure you remind everybody that their charitable donations are tax deductions! This will keep them coming. Guilt your friends into coming as well. If you get popular in the charity circuit you can even start charging a &quot;cover charge for the even expenses, recommended donation is...$xxx&quot; or &quot;$xxx per plate&quot; if it&#x27;s a dinner.<p>6) Subtract misc expenses for room rental, supplies, cheap gifts for volunteers etc.<p>7) Take the donated money, subtract a percentage for &quot;organizational overhead&quot;<p>8) Donate the remainder to your cause or if  you have time, spend the money on &quot;donation events&quot; where you get press for doing some kind of community service (advertising).<p>9) Get your charity to spend money on office equipment, cars, travel expenses etc. Deduct as business expenses.<p>10) Any left over money is a bonus to you for a job well done (can&#x27;t show a profit!)<p>11) rinse and repeat<p>There actually <i>are</i> good charities out there that do good work, but separating them from this kind of self-service is hard to do.",1374951107

Does it matter if the page loads 1ms faster when it was only 20ms before.<p>* Does it scale. This kind of relates to first question but it looks at abnormal amounts of traffic (Slashdot effects).

Robert Hare as well, but personally I tend to think of his work is sophomoric at the best of times and idiotic at the worst .

Certainly not some sort of empathy switch.<p>Generally speaking, that confusion is part of the problem with both terms.

6113940,comment,6113610,6113610,8,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I&#x27;m voting this up because it seems a heartfelt reaction against figuring out that charitable giving is its own scam -- a scam by well-meaning people all out to do good in the world, but a scam. By that I mean that there is no feedback loop in place to assure the donors that they&#x27;re wrong. Every deal is one to save the day. Every idea is some great idea from one place transplanted somewhere else. There&#x27;s a business in assembling ideas into attractive memes and then getting rich people to make themselves feel better by paying for them. A very big business. So hats off to Buffett for pointing it out. I especially like the term conscience laundering<p>Having said that, I call bullshit here. While he&#x27;s done a bit of fumbling around at what his end of the problem looks like, and he&#x27;s certainly correct that preventing slavery beats the shit out of having free wi-fi, I&#x27;m not feeling he has any better idea of what the hell he&#x27;s talking about than the folks peddling the latest charitable cause. And he admits as much. So as a plea for the system being broken, count me in. As any indication of way forward? It&#x27;s not in the essay.<p>I also want to point out that everybody seems to understand that you make money in your life one way, you may find value in a completely different way. But people giving money, most of which are rich, seem to be completely detached from this concept. Working in a factory for two bucks a day and not starving, while watching your family grow up and being involved in some religious or civic group might be a freaking ton better than not being &quot;exploited&quot; We cut ourselves slack for finding value in things other than money, but we do not allow the same privilege to others. Because charities run on dollars, we tend to subconsciously value their lives in dollars as well. Bad premise.<p>Since the solution space is so thin, I&#x27;ll take a flyer on what he <i>might</i> like to see. As opposed to the latest in charitable wizardry, my ideas and five bucks will get you a cup of coffee.<p>Societies evolve by the flow of information and goods contributing to an open market. Information flow to people? Education. Unrestricted goods flowing to an informed buyer? A win for all parties. Innovation and solutions formed by cross-pollinating folks with radically different backgrounds and knowledge? Another win for everybody. It&#x27;s all information and trades. Bad societies control information and trade. Good societies let a thousand flowers bloom and grow by productive creative destruction. So far, many folks are on-board with this. <i>But what we continue to forget is that forms of society itself is just another structure that can benefit from these same principles</i>.<p>My position is that the problem here lies in our hidden assumptions. Every charitable intervention has a bunch of a priori assumptions made about what would work or wouldn&#x27;t. As Buffett said, many times it&#x27;s just playing MadLibs with good ideas. This is the wrong way to look at the problem, and will continue to lead to suboptimal solutions.<p>If you&#x27;re looking to do something radical, encourage governmental units to become much smaller. Instead of having one third-world country rule tens of millions over a large area, replace it with a hundred smaller governments with much less land area. Create zones where completely new ways of getting along can be tried -- a new form of socialism, radical objectivism, whatever. Instead of arrogantly thinking we know the answer to the problems and they must fit into one of our predefined categories and work inside existing societal structures, work on giving people ownership and control over trying zillions of their own ideas, and let&#x27;s all watch and see what works for them. In this way, we actually <i>create</i> a huge pool of new information that didn&#x27;t exist before about what works or doesn&#x27;t work in various circumstances instead of just rehashing theory. This information can be shared and will have value to many millions more. And then we can all move forward.<p>Our problem is that we insist on taking highly-complex and intricately-detailed problems and then solving them by banging on them with feel-good hammers of convenient and easily-understood slogans from our own life experiences.",1374950859

With private entities, the lender is on the hook if it goes bankrupt and can&#x27;t fulfill its obligation.  With public entities, the citizen is on the hook, so the only solution is to increase taxation down the pike, unless you have a miraculous recovery that restores the economy to what it was before (plus interest).

Using PL/1 must be like flying a plane with 7000 buttons, switches and handles to manipulate in the cockpit. I absolutely fail to see how we can keep our growing programs firmly within our intellectual grip when by its sheer baroqueness the programming language our basic tool, mind you! already escapes our intellectual control.</i><p>It would be hard to find a clearer advocation of simplicity in programming languages.<p>But a clearer statement of his priorities - and why they are priorities - can be found here:<p><i>A study of program structure had revealed that programs even alternative programs for the same task and with the same mathematical content can differ tremendously in their intellectual manageability. A number of rules have been discovered, violation of which will either seriously impair or totally destroy the intellectual manageability of the program. These rules are of two kinds. Those of the first kind are easily imposed mechanically, viz. by a suitably chosen programming language. Examples are the exclusion of goto-statements and of procedures with more than one output parameter. For those of the second kind I at least but that may be due to lack of competence on my side see no way of imposing them mechanically, as it seems to need some sort of automatic theorem prover for which I have no existence proof. Therefore, for the time being and perhaps forever, the rules of the second kind present themselves as elements of discipline required from the programmer...</i><p>Your complaint is essentially that I focused on rules of the first kind described, when Dijkstra did a lot of work on rules of the second kind.  If I were truly doing that then I&#x27;d be failing to understand him exactly as badly as you are in saying he was only interested in rules of the second kind while ignoring the fact that his largest concrete impact came from <a href=""http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rubinson/copyright_violations/Go_To_Considered_Harmful.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rubinson/copyright_violations/Go_T...</a>.<p>I recognize and value his work in both areas.

6113872,comment,6113610,6113779,1,0,mjn,,,"For a wealth tax on smallish amounts of wealth, I agree those are problems. But a wealth tax is usually contemplated as being on large fortunes. That removes the need to worry about the valuations of small stuff. And it also makes encouraging spending rather than accumulation a feature rather than a bug: one purpose of a wealth tax on large fortunes is to prevent large fortunes from accumulating and being maintained indefinitely, i.e. to prevent the emergence of a kind of aristocracy.<p>Thomas Paine proposed an early version of a wealth tax for that reason. His version was something of a hybrid between an inheritance tax and a wealth tax: it was an annual assessment on the current value of inherited estates. That has some conceptual advantages: unlike a straight wealth tax it exempts self-made fortunes for the lifetime of their maker, and unlike a straight inheritance tax it doesn&#x27;t happen all at once as a single lump sum (which can be problematic for inheritance of hard-to-divide things as well as easier to dodge with instruments like generation-skipping trust funds).

I&#x27;d have about $200,000 more in my bank account&quot;<p>Because you had a bad outcome.<p>So first w/o getting into the math numbers which I will assume are correct I will say the following.<p>Looking at any decision strictly by the numbers may make you come to the wrong conclusion and is a reason why it <i>sometimes</i> can be a mistake to look at only one angle (financial or, say, engineering) when making a decision.<p>For example the housing stock when renting tends to be more transient and less stable than with buying (people coming and going). Now even if you can rent a house in a stable neighborhood (rather than an apartment building) that is primarily owned and occupied by owners (as opposed to renters) you still end up with the issue of a) having to rely on someone else (the landlord) to fix things. b) not being able to make improvements to the property (because you need approval or because why put in a new kitchen to something you don&#x27;t own?) and c) The neighbors may treat you differently if you are a renter (may or may not happen may or may not matter simply pointing out). You are of course also susceptible to the whims of the landlord rent wise and have the costs of moving if you need to do so.<p>Owning (as does owning a business rather than being an employee) also comes with certain &quot;psychic&quot; benefits that are hard to quantify and, most importantly, have different value to different people.<p>Personally (and I&#x27;ve rented obviously) I prefer to own because that way I can do what I want when I want even recognizing that it might cost me more to live that way. I also buy cars I never lease. I like to sell when I want to sell and not have to wait for the term to end. Other people are looking for another type of certainty (that isn&#x27;t important to me) or perhaps don&#x27;t have the cash flow or need the cash flow for something else. Everybody is different.<p>As far as your situation you bought in 2005 and in hindsight you are not happy with the decision. I&#x27;ve had ups and downs with real estate as well (more ups though over time).<p>&quot;I paid $567,000 for it and it&#x27;s worth $540,000 based on my most recent appraisal.&quot;<p>Doesn&#x27;t mean anything until you decide to sell it though.<p>I have a property (investment) that I bought for about 50k, could have sold at the top for, say, 180k, is worth now perhaps 125k. Unless I want to sell none of that really matters (don&#x27;t need to finance it or anything) only thing that really changes is the property tax.<p>&quot;Notice I didn&#x27;t mention routine maintenance and fixing things&quot;<p>Once again some people may prefer to take care of this in something they own and not be bothered by it (just like some people don&#x27;t want to wait for the &quot;tech guy&quot; to come and get the PC running). Personally there are pros and cons to each thing. If the A/C breaks in my house I would rather not have to wait for a management company to scramble a repairman to fix it.

Some people make good leaders and have empathy.<p>What I am worried about, and the criteria that fits your description more neatly (in my opinion -- I&#x27;m not a psychologist) is sociopathic behaviour - manipulative, deceptive, sans empathy, and in pursuit of power/dominance, but often outwardly charming.<p>These people can do very well and reach very powerful positions - there are statistics showing that density of sociopaths is higher amongst the population of CEOs than amongst the general population for example.  There&#x27;s probably fair reason to assume that many would love to have access to the kind of information and power that spy agencies now possess.<p>Interestingly and controversially there has also been research into using &#x27;big data&#x27; to identify sociopathic tendencies.  Would spy agencies use this, and would they ever turn the glass on their own employees/leaders?  I think the answer is that they would, but they would easily be convinced that they need powerful leaders to ensure the ongoing dominance of their countries on a global scale.<p><a href=""http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/23/twitter-psychopaths"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/23/twitter-psych...</a><p>PS: I felt compelled to reply because I think it&#x27;s a little dangerous to suggest that this is a purely natural result of human pack behaviour - it is possible to spot and call out sociopathic behaviour if it can be identified, and so I don&#x27;t personally think this trend towards authoritarianism is natural or unstoppable.",1374949200

Especially if you are the least bit neurotic about home prices, the state of the market, and the preservation of your principal (to say nothing of positive ROI).<p>Buying is not for the faint of heart, the easily stressed, or anyone who&#x27;s even slightly uncertain about the direction of the next 5-10 years of his life.<p>Some people just don&#x27;t want the headache. And you don&#x27;t know how big a headache it really is until you&#x27;ve taken the plunge. I know more than a few former homeowners who have sworn they&#x27;ll never buy again, regardless of whether it makes financial sense.",1374948217
6113781,comment,6112467,6113638,10,0,stiff,,,"There are hundreds of EWDs and I haven&#x27;t seen a single one where Dijkstra would talk about making programming languages simple to make comprehension straightforward, this is something that modern programming &quot;gurus&quot; are more likely to say. The reason Dijkstra wants simple programming languages, and most EWDs are more or less about this, is because he wants to <i>prove theorems about programs</i>, which is possible only with a simple language. Not only that, as I said he wants to <i>reduce program development to well defined transformations on a specification of a problem in the language of mathematical logic</i>. His stance is very nicely summarized here:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cruelty_of_Really_Teaching_Computer_Science"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cruelty_of_Really_Teaching_...</a><p>You have to understand some mathematics and mathematical logic to really understand Dijkstra however, you cannot look at it from a pure software engineering background because you will only take away platitudes from what he says without actually understanding him. If you have some background you can read about his real technical ideas:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_derivation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_derivation</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarded_Command_Language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarded_Command_Language</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_transformer_semantics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_transformer_semantics</a><p>This is the area Dijkstra worked most on during his research career. Those ideas actually go back centuries before anyone ever thought about structured programming. For hundreds of years there has been a fundamental debate ongoing on whether all kinds of reasoning can be reduced to some kind of calculi with well specified rules, which would be equivalent to being able to construct a (at least theoretical) machine for automating it. This is where computers come from, this goes back to Charles Babbage, to the works of Leibniz, Boole, Turing etc.<p>Dijkstra is in the same historical tradition. The program I understand Dijkstra has for Computer Science is similar to the program Hilbert had for mathematics with what is now called formalism, from which the work of Goedel and Turing sprung off. When programming was still mainly done by mathematicians this has been a lively research area, there were various systems of proving correctness invented, various ways of deriving programs, there has been a very heated debate on when proofs are needed and to what extent ordinary programmers have to master them etc. You can find loads of books and monographs written in the 70s and 80s about this. Now as far as research goes program derivation seems to be an almost dead topic, but there are still people today championing it in some alternative form. Richard Bird wrote a book called &quot;Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design&quot; where he derives algorithms using algebraical properties:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/richard.bird/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/richard.bird/</a><p>Alexander Stepanov has been advocating something similar and wrote a book called &quot;Elements of Programming&quot;:<p><a href=""http://www.elementsofprogramming.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elementsofprogramming.com/</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9gpJga4Vc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9gpJga4Vc</a>",1374948216

Not enough people are willing to look at the root of the problem: the monopoly on the issuing of currency and credit in the US that is held by private interests. When private interests control the volume of currency, they control the material life of the country, including the government. The growing imbalance of wealth and income is a direct result of this cause.<p>Tax reform is a good idea but it&#x27;s meaningless if it leaves the nations&#x27;s ownership of currency and credit in private hands.",1374948139

I have not done a project with both Backbone.js and AngularJS in the same project. I know some people do that but I truly cannot think of anything Backbone.js brings to that party.<p>As for Backbone.js by itself... It&#x27;s OK, I liked it but we had a large project with as many has half a dozen people working on it at its peak and the problem we got into was all of the huge gaps in Backbone.js that you typically fill with other software (two-way binding, validation, templating, AMD, etc.) and if you don&#x27;t figure out your solutions for all of those gaps before you start every developer in the group ends up filling it his or her own way. Especially if you&#x27;re under a time crunch and writing really fast.<p>We ended up with a working project at the end and it was way faster than their old solution but it was a chimera. Every part of it appeared to be a different animal. With AngularJS a lot more of those parts are part of the framework itself and there&#x27;s less room for that kind of problem.

I am not surprised, not a least bit.<p>>>I am sorry to say this, but parents come with an old generation mindset ... Because they think that if he gets a job he has settled in life ... Unfortunately, what they dont realize is that there is no such thing as settling in IT jobs.<p>They come with a very correct mindset. For many people here. Including my own family, getting to a IT job was a long drawn battle against very tough financial conditions, social pressures and all other kinds of problems. There are people, including few of friends where they were the first people to enter a Engineering college. Imagine having to drive a taxi, or an auto rickshaw, or pushing a vegetable cart, or a small time farm worker practically working 18 hrs/day and then sacrificing every small desire of yours to save every single paise and doing this for decades you can so that your child can study. And imagine the kid, having to wear only two shirts and two pants a year. Traveling in near-to-explode crowded buses in a city starving all afternoon, and practicing math problems on a newspaper just to get a decent degree and a job.<p>From their perspective, they are really reaching a milestone, when they get a full time job. At least that is how I felt I when I got my full time job at a Call center here in Bangalore. You might think that&#x27;s a disaster for an engineer. But from my perspective, the analogy is similar to a person dying out of thirst in a desert getting a glass of cold water, and you criticizing him for not aiming for Apple juice.<p>Its extremely difficult to understand this, unless you have suffered the same fate. Even if you think you do, you don&#x27;t. You really need to suffer from it, to understand what it is.<p>Remainder of your post has some nice insights. But I believe our society suffers from a crisis of honesty. Throughout my entire childhood, teens and now in a job I see rampant corruption. I don&#x27;t mean bribery. But unfair play of all kinds. Question papers in exams getting leaked, seats in colleges being secured through &#x27;high influences&#x27; & capitation fees, Seats denied to general category students due to reservations.<p>And now in the corporate job, I don&#x27;t see things as any different here. In fact this is the worst I&#x27;m seeing in my life. Even if you are the best programmer out there, you will be slaughtered in the resulting office politics. I&#x27;ve seen some super idiots being promoted, sent to onsite locations, and given amazing hikes just because his manager happens to be speaking the same language as him, or belongs to same state from some part of India, or is because of some religion. At the same time, the entire industry is full jumping jacks, attrition in nearly every company is record high. Because every one wants to be a manager, thanks to the IT services companies and the mess they created in 90&#x27;s. Now every one joining this industry thinks programmers are losers, and climbing the corporate ladder is all that is sole measure of one&#x27;s success, or how many time one has visited the US.<p>Meritocracy is dead in the water, when it comes to the programming scene in India. If you want progress, you need to be some managers&#x27;s pet and &quot;suck up&quot; to him. Playing political games, and being in manager&#x27;s power structure is all that counts. Else find your self a manager who is of your state or speaks your language.<p>This has nothing to do with engineering education. Its about being honest and playing fair. Besides I chuckle every time a guy gives &#x27;engineering education&#x27; as a reason to not do something. A 20+ year old with Google at his disposal, has 0 reasons to complain when it education and knowledge these days.<p>Start up&#x27;s and bootstrapping are our only hope at this point of time.",1379931665

I prefer Yahoo, mainly for the same reason the OP mentions about the size of compose. Yahoo compose gives you almost the full screen, in its own tab. It gives you space to think, copy and paste, vomit draft.<p>Also, objectively, from the time I hit the bookmark, to the time I see my inbox, Yahoo is faster than Gmail. Where Yahoo loses is the terrible ugly display ads that loaded in.<p>ps: you know what other site has an annoyingly small compose space? HN! :)",1379930672

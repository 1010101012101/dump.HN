CPU and Battery are debatable issues, but Flash has serious memory management issues. On a device like the iPhone or iPad, with a max of 256mb of RAM, no swapping, and a browser that has trouble keeping a few ""tabs"" in memory, adding Flash to the mix seems like a recipe for disaster.<p>It'll be interesting to see how Android handles this.

It relied upon a law called the Fair Credit Reporting Act which allowed consumers to place a fraud alert on their credit file, which the creditor was supposed to call.  Debix placed the fraud alert on behalf of consumers, but directed the creditor to call Debix which delivered the credit request using exactly such an authentication mechanism that you describe.  This was 2003.<p>Lifelock used the same mechanism (though without the phone authentication, IIRC).  Experian sued Lifelock saying that the FCRA did not allow for <i>companies</i> to set fraud alerts on behalf of consumers, only consumers were allowed to set them.  In May of last year,  a judge agreed with Experian, and Lifelock later settled and stopped using fraud alerts.  <a href=""http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=20078"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=20078</a><p>Unfortunately, this ruling also meant that Debix could no longer set fraud alerts, so they had to cancel this product.<p>The truth is such a product creates friction in the instant credit market, which is a huge source of income for credit bureaus.

We've been making changes to how we handle support to better address problems like this and it sucks that you were shafted here.<p>Since Disqus is a service used on sites (and not contained in our own world), our support inquiries come from both website owners and their audiences and involve so many different scenarios. So we need to better educate users on how things work first of all. But that support volume made finding real bug reports or big issues hard (I just posted a HN comment about using our support software earlier today). We've made some changes here though.<p>This also pains me because we try really hard for great interaction with users, even calling up users to help them figure things out. We're definitely closer to a more holistic solution in this area.<p>(P.S. the most likely reason for your issue is perhaps you changed your post's permalink URL so Disqus could no longer find the right association.

So we downloaded it where it wasn't sold as damaged: Suprnova.<p>During that time, stupidity was occurring with DVDs with rotating CSS keys and 'bad block filled with data'. I was downloading films I wanted to archive, but couldn't easily rip.<p>Games were not that bad, but soon became horrendous in terms of screw-user checks, up to the point of driver breaking installs of trash-ware and other nefarious garbage.

TACK allows sites to cache certificate pins, typically after first contact, so that any site on the Internet can have the same protection that Google's properties have today by virtue of the hardcoded pins in Chrome.<p>As Moxie Marlinspike has said, on HN even, TACK is a sensible and achievable first step towards a substrate that we can build notaries or other trust models on top of. It doesn't require years of study and consideration; it merely extends something that browser vendors already do for their preferred sites.<p>Meanwhile, browsers can't simply treat sites under self-signed certificates as normal plaintext HTTP sites. The user reached the site through an HTTPS URL, which promised them security. When the browser detects and warns about a self-signed certificate, it is telling the user ""this site is lying about its security"". The simple way to understand this: start by asking what a browser should do when the Citibank Online Banking Login presents a broken cert, and then ask how the browser should know when it's OK for a site to present as merely ""not encrypted"" (ie, HN login) and when it's not OK (ie, online banking). It can't. The browser has to assume that HTTPS sites with broken certificates are sensitive.<p>Remember also, the ""broken certificate"" case is exactly what happens when an attacker intercepts a TLS connection for a MITM attack.",1354297926

Any employer that doesn't want to be a chump should hire most workers on the basis of a work-sample test.<p>What an institution of higher education could do to respond to what research says about preparing learners to succeed in finding jobs and doing jobs well is make various work-sample tests part of a graduation comprehensive examination. Currently higher education degrees are based mostly on ""seat time"" (so that the saying is, ""All you need to get a degree is a heartbeat and a check""), rather than on demonstrated competencies for doing any useful form of work.<p><a href=""http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/01/18/study_finds_large_numbers_of_college_students_don_t_learn_much"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/01/18/study_finds_la...</a><p>A college or university that says to the world, ""Our graduates who obtain our diplomas demonstrate their competence with work-sample tests, the results of which we list on their official academic records"" would rapidly gain notice from companies with research-based hiring procedures.

Linus started git, then Github made it social, then everyone started using git, so you did too.<p>Think of it exactly like an atomic bomb. Atomic bombs are simple: you need fissile material that decays and emits neutrons, and you need it to get close enough to keep a reaction going.<p>The fissile material in this case is the quality of the software. If it's good, consider it fissile. If it sucks, it probably ain't exploding anytime soon. Git is good. It works, it's fun to use, and it's collaborative.<p>The trigger was Linux. A large developer community suddenly was introduced to it, and used it day-to-day as Linus was still developing Git itself. The bomb had dropped.<p>Github was the mechanism itself. It brought all of the developers closer together (like neutrons) and the reaction started spreading. The quality of the experience ensured people actually wanted to be there, and to share it.<p>Critical mass of ~the social web~ anything in society. 1. Quality, 2. Trigger, 3. Social Mechanism.

95315,comment,95242,95242,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Having grown up overseas, I'm shocked at how unaware people in the States are at the differences overseas.  A friend of mine is neck deep in providing hardware for two new Beijing and Bangalore branches of his company.  It's a nightmare.  I'm assuming an exec just said, ""let's open up branches in China and India"" without researching things fully and thinking through the implications.<p>My friend is having nightmares just getting computer equipment through customs.  I can't imagine trying to invest millions in startups in a foreign country.<p>I'd think that investors would be better off investing stateside in companies that are focused internationally.  There's not much to stop a startup in the US from developing it's site in Mandarin or Cantonese.",1199631210

95313,comment,95313,95214,0,0,pg,,,"As I've mentioned before, the average age of the founders of Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft was 24.  So judging from the evidence, 25 is not young for this kind of work.<p>From what I've seen, 21 is young, in the sense that there are a lot of people who aren't ready yet at that age.  But by 25 the kind of people who make good founders are ready.<p>I suspect the phenomenon is more social than biological.  The problem with the 21 year olds is that college tends to preserve some childish illusions about how the world works. So the reason 24-25 is the sweet spot is that it's far enough away from college for those illusions to have worn off.",1199630335

It seems fairly simple and straight forward to do; there are XML libraries for pretty much every language out there.   Why not do it?",1199629889

They wouldn't necessarily be able to tell whether it was source or object code.<p>The late, great Ken Anderson faced this problem when he was working at BBN and the client (the government) insisted the app be written in Java.

By supporting OLPC, Intel subsidized its own competition. In exchange it gained (1) strategic leverage over the project, and (2) contacts for lobbying.<p>If OLPC can give countries a better machine for lower cost the problems here sound like management issues surrounding lobbying efforts. If the opposite is true, that would suggest OLPC is an effective lobbyist organization but ineffective producer -- there is no shame in using the private sector to achieve one's goals of pervasive computing.<p>Then again, I think it was silly to focus on laptops to begin with. Desktop computers provide much more bang for the buck.",1199628480

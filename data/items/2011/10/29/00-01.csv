Hint: the part that's in parentheses is part of my comment too.<p>Let me flesh it out for you. I said, ""The European colonies in America joined the African slave trade because the supply of American Indian slaves was being exhausted, as a matter of fact."" Which means I'm not only aware of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, but I even outlined the specific reason why slavery of American Indians wasn't sustainable and why the North American colonies had to engage in the trans-Atlantic slave trade to begin with. The fact is, west Africa had more slaves to sell.<p>Speaking of Brazil, if you start at the end of the second paragraph of Wikipedia's article about slavery in Brazil, it says the exact same thing happened in Brazil:<p><pre><code>    Starting around 1550, the Portuguese began to trade   \n    enslaved Africans due to two main reasons:\n\n    * The unenculturated indigenous peoples deteriorated \n      rapidly, and became increasingly wary of the \n      Portuguese, thus, obtaining new indigenous slaves was \n      becoming harder and harder.\n</code></pre>\nI try to play nice on Hacker News, but when people don't even read and comprehend what I write, and then accuse me of saying the exact opposite of what I said, I get a little annoyed. Part of common courtesy is to understand and respond honestly to others, and frankly, you've failed to do that.",1319849982
3170721,comment,3169209,3170437,2,0,felipemnoa,,,"I feel a similar way when trying to learn something new that looks/feels like magic. The tutorials are simple enough and give awesome results but for some reason I don't get it. After much practice eventually something clicks and it turns out that there was no magic, it really is as simple as claimed.<p>I think that it seems like magic to us because our brain refuses to believe that it is that simple. But specially because we lack the practice. After much practice eventually a threshold is reached and the brain decides that you've been exposed to enough patterns and nothing else is left to learn and that is when ""it just clicked"" happens. At least that is what I think is happening. Your brain is protecting you from claiming you've learned something new without enough practice.",1319849975

Actually a quick Googling of ""dude gender neutral"" tells me dude's gender-neutral usage goes back to the 1970s, and has been written on some.<p>I certainly don't think women would want to be called ""programmerettes"" or ""programmeresses"" en masse. And I'm too afraid to Google those.<p>As to the points I was trying to make, my intent was to say that yes, I believe it absolutely would drive off more women than men by appealing to a culture that is male-dominant. But I wouldn't go so far as to suggest that it was done with the explicit intent of establishing a ""no girls allowed"" company. I do think those guys should've been more thoughtful about who they were appealing to, and I'm glad MattManser brought it to our attention; it's an interesting read. But I'm not as quick to call them sexist assholes. For all I know, they were going for a sense of cultural fraternity (that someone earlier in the thread excellently brought up as a word that, despite its roots, is a feeling we all typically aim to share.) Then again, that leads directly to my second point...<p>Being a part of that culture? That isn't a place I would want to work, either. But just because I find something untoward doesn't mean everyone would. That's what I mean when I said women get to decide what's offensive toward them, not men.<p>If men think something is offensive toward women, and women don't... Then I think it would be a very odd argument indeed. I think men can have an opinion on it, and I think most of us here probably agree it's at the very least tasteless, but matter like this, I would tend to defer to the party claiming offense. The question becomes what makes HER feel uncomfortable, and avoiding that.<p>It's something polite that could be done with anyone on any topic, but especially should be if the vast majority of a group finds it shockingly offensive.",1319848202

Others are going to create an isotope of Copper, which will decay to cobalt. Obviously by their claim they're only finding copper.<p>The problem here is that only  4.5% of nickel atoms would even be capable, which doesn't sound like an efficient reaction medium. I don't understand how a full atom would be capable of fusing with nickel when a single neutron can't efficiently fuse with a uranium 235 atom at a .72%.<p>What I'm wondering is would there be any energy gain from turning Nickel 58 with 30 neutrons into Copper 59, which decays into Nickel 59, which in turn decays into Cobalt 59. However, this decay is long lived (76,000 years so likely not going to result in any immediate energy gains), but then there's the potential of turning cobalt 59 into nickel 60.<p>So then you reach the question of does turning Nickel 58 into Nickel 60 net you energy? Also would keep forcing a new proton into Nickel 60 making it Copper 61, decaying into Nickel 61 + proton -> Copper 62 -> Nickel 62 (the highest binding energy) actually work?<p>Honestly, I think they've found a ""potential"" here, but it's likely just the potential for exploitation. It's been too long since I've done that kind of math to work out if there's the potential for energy gain, regardless of if their 'method' would allow it.",1319846640

6099698,comment,6090549,6097438,1,0,happy_dino,,,"I think we have a major philosophical difference and talking a bit past each other.<p>Here are the two things why I am using Scala:<p>1. Confidence<p>Scala gives me the confidence that I can build software the way I imagine, I can focus on the user of my code, not on making the compiler happy.<p>While there are plenty of languages which make easy and medium problems nice to solve (Clojure and Erlang certainly belong to this group), Scala is one of the few languages which keeps supporting me regardless of whether my problem is easy, medium or incredibly hard.<p>In my experience, the work on making hard problems easier had a huge tricke-down effect which in turn improved Scala&#x27;s issue solving capabilities for simple and medium issues.<p>I think the language is better for that and certainly ahead of Erlang and Clojure here.<p>While most hard problems are not common, they are often fundamental. Not being able to solve some issue in the best possible way can have huge negative impact on the whole application and library design.\nThat&#x27;s why for instance making it easier to create macros wasn&#x27;t the first problem to concentrate on. Instead, developers made sure that users of macros had the best possible experience and focused on having one, unified API for reflection, the macros and the compiler, hugely simplifying semantics while re-using battle-proven code.\nMacros makes it possible to pull more functionality out of the language and out of the compiler; into libraries. For instance C# 5 introduced huge language changes with adding async/await to the language. In Scala no language change is necessary: Adding support for async/await would be just a library.<p>Unlike Macros in most other languages and inferior approaches like in Java, Scala macros are type-checked as regular Scala code at the definition site as well as the macro expansion at the call site, removing huge amounts of tricky issues all at once.<p>Great care is taken to make and keep Scala a highly regular language with only the minimal amount of hardcoding necessary to make things work. Unlike Clojure, it doesn&#x27;t have special-cased syntax for collections and a few blessed collection types shipping with the language. Unlike Erlang, Actors are not built into the language.<p>In both cases, Scala avoids irregularity by enabling users to build libraries which can be improved and be replaced without much trouble.<p><pre><code>  Yet Scala seems to want to address every problem with\n  a language feature, and in this case it&#x27;s a huge one.\n</code></pre>\nThis for instance is something I would call blatantly wrong. You confuse the distinction between a language like C# or C++ which adds tons of features to address every fashionable problem and Scala, which keeps its feature count low and orthogonal but manages to solve a lot of those problems by just being a better designed, more expressive language.<p><pre><code>  On the other hand, when I look at Erlang and Clojure \n  (or Ruby, though I&#x27;m less familiar with it), I see \n  languages that were designed by people who sat down \n  and thought long and hard about which are the top one, \n  two or three most burning problems of software \n  development, and then tackled those and only those.\n</code></pre>\nWell, that&#x27;s nice, but I think it is even better that some people decided to bite the bullet and improve a lot of things instead of just building yet-another-language which improves on parts which the creator found subjectively important and regresses on dozens of others.<p>Is it hard to build a language with these intentions? Sure! Is that a reason not to do it? Absolutely not.\nI think one part where Scala has basically proven tons of people wrong is OO/FP. People have been saying for decades that OO and FP are fundamentally opposed to each other. Scala just went ahead and proved them wrong, showing that just because some earlier approaches like OCaml or F# are not that good doesn&#x27;t mean it is impossible.\nAlso, people have been claiming that there will always be a impedance mismatch between languages and databases. Scala went ahead and showed that it has not to be that case.<p>I want the best OO functionality combined with the best FP functionality.\nI want to be able to use higher-order abstractions combined with the best performance and efficiency.\nI want libraries written in the best possible way, not in the way the language decided it was convenient.\nI want to use the right tools for the right job without having to migrate from one language to another.<p><pre><code>  He may be wrong, and he may be right, but he made a decision.\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s 2013. Let&#x27;s stop forcing people to make pointless decisions. I just won&#x27;t choose between things if I can have both, combined into a consistent library.<p>Clojure or Erlang just don&#x27;t deliver here and that Clojure is the best language to manage state is highly debatable, too.<p><pre><code>  I think you should rarely use this tool or that, so I&#x27;m \n  leaving them out of the toolbox. When you need them, buy \n  them separately\n</code></pre>\nThis is by the way exactly what Scala says. The language ships with the tools to enable people to build libraries. By default, everything is left out.<p>Don&#x27;t take me wrong, a language should be as easy as possible  but not easier.<p>2. Community<p>It is pretty non-sensical to ask What is the one or two things Scala is better at than any other language?. There plenty of things it does better, because good enough is just not good enough for people in the Scala community.<p>In general the Scala community is highly critical of every aspect and tend to push things to the current state of the art or beyond it if they feel something can be solved in a better way. This has led to a huge increase of consistency and quality throughout the ecosystem, so that having a few good parts and a lot of mediocre parts is just not acceptable to most Scala developers anymore. They demand the best tools one can possibly build.<p>Anyway, I think your use of coherent is getting more clear, but imho makes less and less sense. You are basically asking for a silver bullet and are unhappy that Scala tells you that for many problems, there isn&#x27;t one. I think this is one of the core advantages of the community: It doesn&#x27;t try to sell you some ultimate solution, avoids ideological bullshit and treats people as grown-ups.<p>For instance, Scala&#x27;s Akka team (those who work on concurrency-related libraries) had an interesting talk recently where the demonstrated something like 9 different approaches/techniques to tackling concurrency, all of them with different benefits and drawbacks, with the main conclusion of pick your poison.<p>I think this is one of the core distinctions between Scala&#x27;s diverse community and other, more anglo-saxon-centric communities: People who have grown up in the US just love to swallow shallow marketing non-sense and respond extremely well to claims about one true way or silver bullets.<p>If somebody came with that approach to the Scala world, people would tell him/her that he/she is either lacking experience, has poor judgement, or probably both and show him/her why he/she is wrong.<p>The way people carefully evaluate different approaches and document its pros and cons instead of following the next hype is exactly why I&#x27;m using Scala.<p>Scala&#x27;s strength is shipping efficient, reliable and fault-tolerant software at a rapid pace.",1374706698

We need both.  It&#x27;s true that schools can&#x27;t manufacture stars, but they can help train those with latent ability, just as Real Madrid players are certainly helped by coming up through smaller teams.<p>Likewise, some places (YC startups, or forward-looking splinter groups in larger industry) need rock stars who can do a lot; but there&#x27;s a huge swathe of megacorps that just need warm bodies that can tab-complete API calls; the problem with debates like this is that arguments are so rarely anchored by a clear context.

This feels like the hobby horse of someone whose just realised that different browser markup exists and decided to arbitrarily blame the W3C.<p>This article starts out in the right place - which is a good thing. There are a large number of websites shown which aren&#x27;t the best designed in the world.<p>Unfortunately, it then goes dramatically of track.<p>&quot;Because were going to have to do it cheaply, with the advertising pushing costs down. This was supposed to be one of the virtues, I think, of web standards.&quot;<p>No, the point of web standards was never to make web design cheap because there is less money to pay for it. That&#x27;s never been the objective. The point of web standards are to make it possible to write a single article which can be viewed in a similar way on a number of different devices.<p>&quot;And the misery exists because of the W3Cthe World Wide Web Consortium. Thats the organization that supervises web standards.&quot; - No, that&#x27;s incorrect. Web standards aren&#x27;t poorly enforced because of the W3C - they are poorly enforced because browser makers extend standards in different ways, and because some browser makers underinvested in maintaing compatibility with the rest of the web (e.g. IE between 1999 and 2008).<p>&quot;... And way too lenient in enforcing them.&quot; - The W3C has NO power to make any browser manufacturer enforce web standards. None. Zilch. Nothing. They can say whether a implementation is standards compliant, but historically that&#x27;s had no effect on either the adoption rate of the browser, or whether the browser manufacturer will do anything.<p>&quot;No. Because PDF is an ISO standard. &quot; - No that&#x27;s not why. It being a standard doesn&#x27;t magically make everyone suddenly exactly implement the standard. PDFs work across platform because there&#x27;s a single reference implementation (Adobe Reader) which all other readers must copy. Also, the PDF standard (as far as the functionality being implemented identically) has been unchanged for the past 15 years. A PDF written today will almost certainly run on a PDF reader written 10 years ago. There&#x27;s nowhere near the same pace of innovation - a browser of 15 years ago is unlikely to be able to perform AJAX, let alone <video>, <audio> or WebGL.<p>&quot;I love that, Tim. Did you say that 15 years ago? No. Well, did you say it five years ago? No. When did you say it? You said it three months ago?&quot; - Aside from the fact that it&#x27;s way easier to pay for things on the web than at pretty much any point in recent history (Compare completing an arbitary online transaction, which might take order of 2 minutes, without a preset price, which may reoccur, to anything older than about five years), Tim Berners Lee is hardly the only person allowed to innovate on the web. There are a dozen companies pioneering online payment protocols. Mozilla are currently looking at WebPayment for Boot 2 Gecko - <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/WebPayment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/WebPayment</a><p>&quot;And if you worry, as some do, that the alternative to no W3C is chaos, or if you worry that the alternative is a web ruled by Google and Microsoft and AppleI dont think so.&quot; - Yes, it was. Please do yourself a favour and look up the WHATWG which took HTML 5 away from the W3C due to disagreements on process. It was pretty much a group of Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, Apple and Opera deciding what happened. Disband the W3C (through some might act of God) and that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll go back to. To be fair, it&#x27;s still those five, just under some other grouping<p>&quot;The W3C could refuse to renew the membership of organizations that took actions contrary to the spirit of web standards, including repeatedly failing to implement them. If the W3C made participation in the consortium contingent on timely implementation, members would either comply or quit.&quot; - You don&#x27;t seem to get that the W3C needs organizations such as Microsoft, Apple, etc a hell of a lot more than they need it. If the W3C rejected them because they happen to have different implementations of gradients, they would reform the WHATWG, and the W3C would have $n less to promote web standards. The W3C does what the member organizations vote that it should do, or they leave. It&#x27;s literally that simple. Hence the sitatuation with DRM and Do Not Track.",1374706079

In fact, I&#x27;m moving to Baltimore (from NYC) for a few years (probably) and really looking forward to it. There are a lot of smart people there-- a lot of different kinds of smart people, unlike in, say, the Valley where there&#x27;s one kind of smart people and that&#x27;s programmers-- and DC is only an hour away. I might end up in California eventually, but I&#x27;m seeing a lot of interest in the most talented people in getting away from the legacy-laden &quot;star cities&quot;. It&#x27;s not quite an &quot;exodus&quot;, but I hear more conversations about Austin than San Francisco around NYC. Six or seven years ago, Austin was barely on the map; even New York was the hinterlands except for Wall Street. Now, the general sense is that the Bay Area is for older people who were able to get in and buy a place at a reasonable price, before it got all fucked up.<p>Makers like new places and open opportunity, as well as freedom from established hierarchies. That means they&#x27;ll always be moving around from one generation to the next. To tell the truth, though, macrolocation (California vs. Texas; Northeast vs. South) seems to matter a lot less over time, and microlocation (cities vs. suburbs, proximity of cafes and bike paths) matters more. I think that trend&#x27;s continuing, thanks to the Internet. 20 years ago, or even 10, being an unusual person (3-sigma intelligence; gay; artistic inclination; minority religion or, in many communities, no religion) in a B city meant social isolation. In 2013, it really doesn&#x27;t; you can find your tribe even if you are, say, an atheist in the South.<p><i>Someone has to budge</i><p>I think that the next 15 years of talented young people are going to be more dispersed than the last 15. That means there will be fewer superhubs and that&#x27;s a good thing. It does, however, fragment the labor market, which means that the volatile culture-- the two-sided itchy trigger finger dynamic-- of promiscuous job hopping and fast firing will have to go. Companies will also be more willing to invest in talent. They&#x27;ll have to be that way; the extremely liquid talent market of the Bay Area now won&#x27;t exist (anywhere) in 10 years.",1374704914

I wonder what the total value of Bitcoin transactions in USD compared to the cost of electricity to keep the block chain up is.<p>The true value that Bitcoin mining provides must be some low percentage of the total Bitcoin transaction volume... or am I missing something?",1374703380

Why say something like &quot;estimates called for the social media giant to post earnings of 14 cents per share on revenue of $1.62 billion&quot;.  Comparing the per-share number to the total revenue tells us next to nothing.  Interpretation of the facts aside, they should at least report the relevant facts.<p>Going to the primary source tells us that the numbers are $333M income on $1.813B of revenue, and the same quarter last year was a ($157M) loss on $1.184B of revenue.  So revenue increased by ~$629M, and income increased by ~$490M.",1374703319

The apps/content don&#x27;t live on the mobile device at all.  They live on remote internet servers.  The device is just feeding a queue.<p>I&#x27;d also add a wrinkle to your statement about devices being awesome as typing/searching interfaces:  that&#x27;s true, but they come with negatives.<p>The real problem with &quot;device as brains&quot;, is that your device does many other jobs.  And you may not want those jobs in-your-face when you&#x27;re watching a movie, or showing pictures, or even just trying to add background-music to a dinner party.<p>Devices are more difficult to deal with when you just want to pause something, the notifications are there, the temptations are there and the social negatives are there [1].<p>But while everyone&#x27;s tossing out Airplay wish-lists -- it&#x27;d be nice if I could airplay a movie to my TV but have the audio still piped to the headphones.<p>[1] You may be trying to switch playlists, but to everyone else it looks for all the world like texting.",1374703211

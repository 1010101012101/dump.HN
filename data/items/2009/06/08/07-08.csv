This seems like jumping the gun if the hardware isn't due out for another month. Are we going to see hardware availability immediately this week?",1244447939

646971,comment,646713,646883,0,0,lsc,,,"Actually, I'm working on that now.  But the part I really suck at is billing, so I want to pass that off on the resellers.  They'd be providing real value for me then.  I've been talking to a few people about this;   what I want to do is provide a interface so the resellers can provision new images themselves, charge the resellers a discount on what I charge normally, then let resellers sell and bill at whatever price the markets can bear.<p>This would help me immensely.  If I didn't have to screw with billing, I could focus more on the technical stuff, which is what I'm good at.   I was going over things the other night, and I'm collecting about half what I'm billing out.   (I imagine that many of those accounts are people who want to close the account who didn't bother telling me, but some are probably interested in continuing service.)<p>The question is how do I let resellers differentiate while I am still doing support?   I like the idea of letting them set the prices (because some people really do want to pay more, and on the business end of things, I want to provide a commodity.  Getting some people to pay more for a commodity than others do is a skill for other people.  One that I'm not particularly interested in developing.)<p>Resellers could differentiate on nicer interfaces, and hopefully some of them would be able to have several providers on the backend... you know, kindof like cloudkick;  you could buy a vps from cloudkick and they could run it on me, on slicehost, ec2, or linode;  that is adding real value for the customer.",1244447870

646969,comment,646326,646326,0,0,jsz0,,,"If Apple hasn't completely forgotten about the Apple TV it would be interesting to see a new revision launched with a full SDK. If Apple doesn't care about the device that much they should really open it up to third parties to fill the gaps in its functionality. Give it a halfway decent 3D chip and a simple motion controller (with iPhone/Touch integration too, of course) they could probably capitalize on all the developers doing games for the iPhone market. It may be Apple's last real chance to get a foot hold in the set top market because both Sony & Microsoft are starting to push more and more non-gaming apps out. Apple will almost surely never be a #1 but they could carve out a very respectable market for themselves -- mostly casual gamers and Internet media consumers who may not be interested in ""hardcore"" gaming.

He further claims that leftism as a movement is led by a particular minority of leftists whom he calls ""oversocialized"":<p><pre><code>    The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and act in a completely moral way. [...] Some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a non-moral origin. We use the term ""oversocialized"" to describe such people.[35]\n</code></pre>\nHe goes on to explain how the nature of leftism is determined by the psychological consequences of ""oversocialization."" Kaczynski ""attribute[s] the social and psychological problems of modern society to the fact that society requires people to live under conditions radically different from those under which the human race evolved and to behave in ways that conflict with the patterns of behavior that the human race developed while living under the earlier conditions."" He further specifies the primary cause of a long list of social and psychological problems in modern society as the disruption of the ""power process"", which he defines as having four elements:<p><pre><code>    The three most clear-cut of these we call goal, effort and attainment of goal. (Everyone needs to have goals whose attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some of his goals.) The fourth element is more difficult to define and may not be necessary for everyone. We call it autonomy and will discuss it later.[36] [...] We divide human drives into three groups: (1) those drives that can be satisfied with minimal effort; (2) those that can be satisfied but only at the cost of serious effort; (3) those that cannot be adequately satisfied no matter how much effort one makes. The power process is the process of satisfying the drives of the second group.[37]\n</code></pre>\nKaczynski goes on to claim that ""[i]n modern industrial society natural human drives tend to be pushed into the first and third groups, and the second group tends to consist increasingly of artificially created drives."" Among these drives are ""surrogate activities"", activities ""directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the sake of the 'fulfillment' that they get from pursuing the goal"".[38] He claims that scientific research is a surrogate activity for scientists, and that for this reason ""science marches on blindly, without regard to the real welfare of the human race or to any other standard, obedient only to the psychological needs of the scientists and of the government officials and corporation executives who provide the funds for research.""",1244447012

How might The Singularity not occur?<p>Human intervention and refusal to allow it, as you already mentioned.<p>It could be a self-fulfilling prophecy, but not necessarily a logical certainty. For example, if I could convince you (and with the same amplitude of conviction that you have right now towards a ""smarter""-computer future) that such a future will inevitably result in the slavery of one man by another, and of ever-more powerful dictatorships (that call themselves democracies), this very thought would be the first step towards the non-conception of the singularity. I believe a person called Theodore Kacinzsky has previously argued along these lines, though he chose a more explosive form of argument than mere words :) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Kaczynski"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Kaczynski</a><p>One alternative is to restrict research to biological advances that benefit humans (stem cell research, for example) rather than trying to create even-more powerful machine learning tools all the time.<p>Just because ""everyone"" eats McDonalds, it does not take away the power of choice from you to never ever visit a McDonalds (for whatever reason), for example. Look at how scarily equipped are the police today, what things man has created for war (weapons that boil your invisibly from a remote distance), and you will understand that technology is fun as long it's not. It doesn't take a genius to look at each invention and decide whether it will most probably be used for the good or result in further loss of privacy and freedom.

Surely it would be seen by millions in a matter of an hour. Why doesn't Windows display a little message in the corner of every desktop, linking to an important charitable cause? Why don't you place a bunch of 5x5 signs of missing kids in your lawn? You value the appearance of your lawn more than the possibility of saving a life? Why do you watch TV when kids are dying? You could be working, and saving money to send them food. You could have saved hundreds of lives if you didn't watch that last season of Breaking Bad.<p>Want more initiative? Hey, let's stick missing kid stickers on the rear window of cars. Or what if every Friday, instead of going out for lunch, everyone in the country donates 5 or 10 dollars to save starving kids. Or what if grocery stores had a basket next to each checkout, and you buy extra food while shopping, then place it in there to be donated? These ideas are a dime a dozen, and this 404 concept is one of the worst I've seen.<p>In short, everyone needs to draw the line somewhere. If someone isn't interested in changing their 404 pages, don't send the guilt trip party, because there are a million ways you could be doing more in your life. Everyone chooses to help to a different degree.",1348621093

4573662,comment,4572872,4573560,3,0,siganakis,,,"It does seem like a lot of work to me.<p>One of the problems is servicing two workloads, one for ""transactional"" processing and another for analysis.<p>For transactional systems you need to be able to change things quickly and consistently.  For analysis you need to be able to query lots of data quickly.<p>For decades people have realized that these are two separate workloads, so have built 2 systems, a transactional system (on an RDBMS) and a data warehouse (generally on an RDBMS).  Data is then shipped between the 2 in batch jobs.<p>The transactional system is normalized, and the data warehouse is normalized.  Within the data warehouse you make denormalized copies of the data that fit the reporting workload required so that as much of the workload is pre-computed as possible.<p>The problem is that as reporting requirements change, you need to modify these pre-computed stores, as they are very heavily tuned for the particular reporting requirement.  Building pre-computed stores is generally done in SQL and can be challenging as you are generally shifting a lot of data and you are trusting the RDBMS to get its optimizations right.<p>There is a trend now to use Hadoop for the building of these pre-computed stores (and even to use Hadoop for the entire data warehouse).  However, writing map-reduce jobs for queries is cumbersome compared to SQL so your productivity suffers.  But you don't have to pay Oracle or IBM for licenses.<p>The key problem is that you need to pre-compute stuff to do fast aggregation, but you can't pre-compute everything.  So what you pre-compute is dependent on what your users want, and that changes all the time.<p>So what you want is a system that lets you change what is pre-computed easily and efficiently.",1348621042

4573657,comment,4572237,4572237,2,0,keypusher,,,"Our formal policy is that at least one other team member must review a change before it is checked in.  My impressions:<p>1.  Many problems get fixed before the review even goes out.  When you know others are going to be looking at the code, you tend to take a much closer look before sending it out.  Also, you tend to clean up those quick hacks you put in to ""just make it work"".<p>2.  It keeps the team informed.  There's always at least one other person out there that knows what you have been working on. This gives you someone to bounce ideas off, but it also keeps a team together, and forces people out of getting silo'd into one particular area.<p>3.  It is often more valuable to send out a review before it's done.  If you are working on a new framework / library / class, it's better to design and prototype it, then send out a review to some people for feedback instead of waiting until you are done.  They might point you in a different direction, or offer criticism, but it's much better to hear that before you have spent weeks on implementation than after.<p>4.  Make the review process universal.  If it isn't required, people won't do it.  And it should be required for everyone, not just the new guys.  Senior people can still learn things too, and if they are really writing great code then it should be shared with the team as an example of how to do things right.<p>5.  Make the review process painless.  Make it easy for people to generate diffs that can be shared and easy to comment, there are good tools out there for this.  If the barrier to checking in changes is too high, a lot of easy fixes will get ignored because people just can't be bothered.",1348620981

We no longer need parking lots because the cars are constantly in use, that will free up a lot of space and mirror what already happens in dense urban areas (which depend on taxis, public transit, parking is very $$$). The cars will wear out in a couple of years from constant use (or maybe not if electric?), but we won't need as many of them. Rush hour commutes are a problem, but road capacity is limited anyways and peak pricing + mass transit + car pooling can lead to a workable solution.<p>Eventually, since all cars are automated, safe highway speeds could be increased dramatically (reduce space between cars, more predictability, reroute and reduce speeds to prevent full stop bottlenecks). Accordingly, you won't even be able to enter the highway in manual mode.",1348620750

At the moment that looks like an AI-hard problem.<p>For your point about sharing knowledge, your argument works against all forms of sharing knowledge. You may as well say that wikis are unnecessary, because standups, code, comments, and code reviews share knowledge. What you have missed is that these different modes of knowledge sharing work better at sharing different kinds of knowledge, which is why you (should) want all of them.<p>Also, good developers are not really fungible. Developer X may be really good at making code flow, so that <i>what</i> it is trying to do is not obscured by <i>how</i> it is doing it, and developer Y might have a really good knowledge of algorithms and an eye for optimisation. In that case, having them review each other's code will always result both in better code and in (eventually) better developers.<p>As far as it goes, I have seen plenty of badly done, useless code reviews. I have also had really well done code reviews, where someone would email me an annotated diff of one of my commits, or where I would pair for a few hours with someone going over some thorny code I or they had committed and making it less thorny, or where we would go back and forth refactoring some piece of code while talking over the whys and wherefores.

GPUs can have hundreds or even thousands of what you might think of as ""cores"", but they're very specialized cores that are only suited to certain kinds of operations. Those operations were originally intended for the problem domain of high-performance graphics, but as it happens, many of those same operations mesh <i>very</i> well with cryptographic hashes. In essence, we've all got specialized massively-parallel password-cracking supercomputers sitting on our desks.<p>Take this up a level, and you might see the most obvious implication: More $500 graphics cards, more passwords cracked in a given timeframe. Very navely speaking, 7,000 $500 graphics cards, $3.5 million. You've just gained the ability to hash every one of those 12-character strings in one year for the cost of a funding round. Oops.<p>Relatedly, you're talking about cracking <i>a</i> password. That's wrong. Nobody cares about cracking <i>your</i> password, or <i>my</i> password. They're going after <i>passwords</i>, in a massively plural sense.<p>Start with 100,000 md5 password hashes. Assume the passwords are all 12 characters (they're not) and they're randomly generated (again, not). You don't conduct a brute-force search for every hash, you conduct a brute force search for 100,000 hashes. 7,000 years divided by 100,000 hashes is 25.55 days. With a $500 graphics card, the crackers can brute-force a password every month.<p>Now, once you realize that the entropy in the average password is not even within an order of magnitude of 60^12, you might begin to see the problem. You'd be lucky to find a password that's 36^8.<p>That purported 7,000 years is starting to look a lot smaller, isn't it?<p>This is why we have things like bcrypt and PBKDF2.",1348617945

4573469,comment,4568426,4573199,1,0,anamax,,,"> If evolution doesn't exist, then why do we constantly see processes evolve based on a feedback cycle of constant experimentation, survival, failure, etc.<p>> Isn't that word evolution?<p>No.  As I wrote, evolution is a stronger claim.<p>Evolution involves feedback but not all feedback is evolution.<p>Many stable amplifier designs use feedback.  Would you claim that the signal being amplified is evolving?<p>As to man-made entities, yes, their designs are affected by feedback.  However, they're also created.<p>As I said, creationists believe in selective breeding.  Their argument wrt evolution is wrt something else, so if you don't understand that....<p>> So I stand by what I said, if evolution isn't real (i.e. evolution doesn't happen) that all things are complex by-design, and never by uncontrolled processes of iteration and survival, if that is true, then evolutionary algorithms wouldn't work.<p>You do know that you didn't say that above, right?<p>However, I'll play along.<p>Your new claim is wrong because algorithms with feedback can work even if evolution doesn't occur in the wild.<p>As to your suggestion that evolution is involved in every complex system, I'll ask how stars evolved.  They're very complex systems.<p>There are lots of complex systems.  Evolution only applies to the biological ones.",1348617713

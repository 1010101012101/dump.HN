That also spells trouble for their would-be competitors. If someone doesn't upgrade his XP box to Windows 7, do you think it's more likely he'll buy a Mac instead?<p>I don't think so.<p>And while web-apps are all the rage these days ... it sounds to me a lot like Sun's marketing campaign for Java or for the NC. I don't see a web-app replacing Office, even if it's powered by Google.<p>Funny thing happened yesterday ... went to my local library to get some books, and the bookkeeper couldn't give me those books to me because their Internet connection went down, and their accounting was done with a web-app ... cursing and screaming in the process.",1265299199
1100737,comment,1100377,1100612,0,0,TheBranca18,,,"Sony may have copied some of the more successful features of the Xbox 360, but I'm going to disagree that the Xbox line has redefined the console gaming experience.<p>It's redefined each generation.  This generation is about motion controls as the top seller of all time, the Nintendo DS, has motion controls alongside its console brother the Wii which also does.  Sure the 360 has stream lined the online experience, however it has also introduced gamers to the closed era of consoles.  You want a bigger HD?  Sure just pay an absolute premium on it.  Not to mention the 360's hardware problems which have been conveniently forgotten.<p>The fact that you're comparing the Wii to flash games is absurd.  It's fine not to like the Wii, I know I don't like it besides some drunken debauchery, but its impact on the industry is clear.  Clear enough that Microsoft and Sony are both coming out with motion control products in the next year.",1265299121

Just looking at the translation you can see the use of YHWH (translated as the LORD) in one psalm, and the lack of use of YHWH in the other. This is probably because one psalm was written by J, and the other was copied by E.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_Hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_Hypothesis</a><p>Also, I'm not quite sure what kind of transcription errors are permitted in Torah scrolls.

I mean Apple as a whole. They do a lot of innovation. iPhone literally revolutionized the way we interact with mobile phones, and iPad is going to do the same with the standard computing model.<p>For me, innovation is all about the regular people. I don't care about the buzzwords, and the top notch innovation, which is used by 0,0069% of the population. Concepts such as cloud computing are so old, it's pathetic they are not widely used.<p>The same goes with iPhone/iPad pair. I know that spec-wide, there's nothing new about these tools. We, hackers, are so used to some concepts, we forget about our dads, girlfriends and co-workers from different departments, which are still in 1995.<p>By the way, I think OS X changed a lot. Not significantly, but a lot. This is not a completely different paradigm but things like MobileMe (iCal, AddressBook in the cloud), Spotlight, iTunes are big steps.",1265299062

It's unquestionably reached status as an iconic platform in the history of console gaming, right up there with the NES and the PS1/2. To outsiders it may seem as though Nintendo is leading this field but that's somewhat misleading. Nintendo opened up a new market and has been able to sell console gaming systems to a whole new group of people who wouldn't have bought them before. This is fabulous for Nintendo, but in a very real sense it means it's no longer operating in the same market as Microsoft and Sony (though there is some overlap).<p>The 360 is the go-to console for any major game developer. Partly because 360 owners buy about 50% more games than either Wii or PS3 owners. Given that games are responsible for the bulk of the profits related to console gaming that's an enormously significant figure. The 360 console is raking in cash for Microsoft and continuing to grow in popularity. It's one of Microsoft's most successful ventures of all time.",1265297120

He did not immediately see the potential of his application for new styles of books and new uses of printing.<p>- Printing presses caught on very quickly in Europe. Once they did, there were very few people who believed illuminated manuscripts were better. Certainly, the Church didn't like losing control over information, but even it recognized that the technology was superior and could serve its own ends (see Elizabeth Eisenstein's <i>The Printing Press as an Agent of Change</i> for more about this, as well as the impact of printing on many aspects of society)<p>- Illuminated manuscripts held on through the early 1600s (see <a href=""http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/medieval/browse.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/medieval/browse....</a>).

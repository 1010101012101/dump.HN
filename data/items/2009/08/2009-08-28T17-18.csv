791851,comment,791459,791800,0,0,dtf,,,"C++ hits a certain sweet spot. In some cases - whether you like it or not - it's just the right tool for the job. Two examples I can think of are:<p>* VM implementations (I mentioned Factor, but also HotSpot, Microsoft's CLR, SquirrelFish, TraceMonkey, V8 and Opera's Carakan are all high-performance VMs written in C++ (x). Note also that all major layout engines are written in C++. Complex but fast and highly-tuned beasts)<p>* Production rendering. PRMan, MentalRay and pretty much every other renderer in day-to-day use on film and video post-production are written in C++.<p>People who write these systems care deeply about performance. They'll dip into assembly when they have to. While fast, C won't cut it because in these cases, it doesn't give you enough abstraction to avoid making your code a mess (strong typing, operator overloading and templates in particular, but also virtual method dispatch)*. I'm sure if you ask them, they'd tell you that they'd love to use something nicer and more modern. But it doesn't yet exist.<p>This is not to say that C++ is the right tool for writing web applications, or even the average desktop application, or even - increasingly these days - games. But somebody needs to write the stack underneath, and that stack needs to be fast.<p>(x) note Mono as an example of a VM that sticks with C. But it contains a lot of object-oriented shennanigans that probably could be better expressed  in C++, and the core developers came from a strong C culture.",1251481494

This is particularly true given how many bad C++ programmers there are (which is partly down to the language learning curve).<p>Strict typing was mostly about trapping programming errors at compilation rather than runtime.

And ask yourself, is this really a big problem? How often have you actually seen someone embed Perl (or any other language) in Python? Why is that admonition sandwiched between remarks on unit testing and maintaining control flow?<p><i>On another note, everyone seems to love anonymous, first-class functions with closures, and yet they never give nontrivial examples - what am I missing out on?</i><p>Spend some time with a language that not only supports them but actually encourages their use, and you will see for yourself. For example, both Smalltalk and Ruby make heavy use of blocks, and because of that classes can be written to allow users to greatly customize their behavior without the need of subclassing.<p><i>(For that matter, I still haven't seen what TCO offers that is new, but that was April's issue.)</i><p>TCO allows programs to, in certain circumstances, reuse existing stack frames for possibly many function invocations. For example, if a function is written to be tail recursive, a VM with TCO could reuse the same stack frame for each recursive function invocation until the terminating condition is reached, at which point the last return value is caught and the frame is popped off the stack. (TCO isn't strictly limited to making tail recursion more efficient, but that is its most often cited benefit.)<p>The main reason Guido and his Pythonistas have no use for TCO is that they also have no use for recursion.

Just view the source of a site to figure out what style or id would disable the parts that annoy you.<p>Some caveats:<p>- Some browsers only read the custom stylesheet once, at startup, so if you modify it you won't see differences immediately.<p>- Since there's just one stylesheet, all sites using the same style names would have the same filter.

On the average, massive score improvements are rare, but there are definitely some test prep teachers who can consistently get better score improvements from students.  The secret is tailoring your approach to different students' needs.  I always looked at the types of questions my students got wrong to identify patterns.  If you can fix a bad habit you can get bigger score gains with less effort.  My best success story was a student who went from a 980 to a 1420 (out of 1600).  That's about 50th percentile to 95th percentile.  Another student went from hoping to meet the NCAA minimum for a baseball scholarship to getting an academic full ride.  The last student I taught almost beat my score...I took the new SAT in 2005 along with him and he got a 2180 out of 2400 (I got a 2280...99th percentile).",1251478830

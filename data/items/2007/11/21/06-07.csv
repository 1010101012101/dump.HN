82380,comment,81594,82154,0,0,Zak,,,"Hello world shows how much boilerplate is required before you can print a message to stdout. It's one of several important factors for any language you might use for quick and dirty throwaway programs. You want it to be two tokens only - the name of the print function and the string to be printed.",1195627920

Were they really convinced that ""...any business idea that ran on .NET was a bad one."" or just that it was Hell to work with .NET?<p>> It doesn't make much sense to me from a business standpoint.<p>It's really about quality of life. I tried using Windows for a spell, for XBox development -- I ended up running Linux under Moka5 for a userland, and then switching into Windows once in awhile to kick the XBox. Until I got that in place, I was miserable.\n",1195626921

82375,comment,81752,82265,0,0,ericb,,,"Simple, no, but I'll bite on the second half of your statement ""that there's even a chance of it happening this century"" because the chance is there. Curing aging is incremental. Life expectancy at birth in the United States in 1900 was 47 years, today it's 76. <p>It's fascinating--you're so confident in your negativity that you'll predict 100 years out! I couldn't have imagined 30 years ago I'd be wasting time on something called the internet responding to a troll calling people ""suckers"" in a hacker forum, but here I am. Shame on me for responding, really. Good night...",1195626548

82372,comment,82068,82110,0,0,jsnx,,,"Yeah, I really have to second this one. It's not just the UNIX/C universe, though -- it's the UNIX scripting universe. As a particular example, how do you tie your graphing software to your analysis software to your screen scraping software? You could try writing them all in Python -- or you could just use pipes and tie together GNU plot and wget with some custom filters in Python. It takes a few years to get confident with this stuff; but once you are, you will never write so little code :)",1195625920

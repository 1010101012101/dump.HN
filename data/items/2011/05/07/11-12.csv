Therefore there is a certain utilitarian argument in favor of putting the wealth where it will have the most benefit.

Pretty much all Java code will run in Groovy unchanged, and you can update existing working Java code with some Groovy decorations in the same file without issue.  Moving to JRuby or Jython, for example, require you to make larger changes to rethink entire classes in the new syntax.<p>Admittedly some people consider this a small point, but it's certainly nice for some people to be able to reuse existing Java syntax without needing to learn a lot of new syntax up front - with Groovy you can try out new syntax as you go, but always drop back to raw Java when you want (again, in the same file - you can use existing Java classes in JRuby and Jython IIRC).",1304767288

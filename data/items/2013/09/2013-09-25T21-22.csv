But at the time I thought it was a problem I could&#x27;ve taken care of in less than a minute, basically de-activate my account then create another one and add the code. In this case I chose not to contact them, because as fast as their support can be it mostly likely won&#x27;t be faster than I can de-activate and make a new account. But I was wrong as my account was locked :(<p>Another thing is their ToS. I admit I didn&#x27;t read their ToS prior to registration (most people don&#x27;t I assume, but I won&#x27;t use that as an excuse), but I did go back and read it afterwards, and it said:<p>&quot;Users are restricted from registering multiple accounts with the same billing details without first notifying DigitalOcean of that intent to ensure that accounts aren&#x27;t automatically flagged as possibly fraudulent and without notification accounts may be treated as abuse and/or fraudulent which would lead to suspension of service.&quot;<p>And I thought, even if I did read this I would&#x27;ve reasonably assumed that since my other account has been de-activated, I&#x27;m free to make a new one with the same billing information.

Personally, I&#x27;m most empathetic to the duopoloy argument. Where I live - in a small city in Sweden - we can get 300-500 Mbit/s download and 30-50 Mbit/s upload for under US$150 per month (says <a href=""https://www.comhem.se/bredband/bredbandspaket"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.comhem.se/bredband/bredbandspaket</a> ).<p>On that scale, AT&T U-verse High Speed Internet, with a &#x27;Max Turbo&#x27; download speed of 24 Mbit/s at $66/mo (says <a href=""http://www.att.com/u-verse/explore/internet-landing.jsp?fbid=WiZ4HAzVwNH"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.att.com/u-verse/explore/internet-landing.jsp?fbid...</a> ), is rather slow.<p>For the same price we can get 30-50 Mbit/s download. Which is what I have, since 500 Mbit/s is a lot more than we need. This is the first time in my life I&#x27;ve ever not gotten the highest bandwidth option.<p>Unfortunately, it looks like the best choices for you are either to look for alternative and/or get involved with politics. At the very least, complain to your city and state representatives, since that has the most impact on your local service providers.<p>Can you quantify how much time is wasted, and how much that is worth to you? This would help strengthen your complaint, and perhaps help you understand which alternatives might be more worthwhile.<p>Wicked! I just learned about 3G/4G cellular bonding. &quot;The LiveU solution bonds up to 14 cellular (3G/4G  LTE/WiMAX) modems over multiple carriers, as well as multiple LAN and even BGAN satellite connections. This creates a reliable, broadband video uplink pipe over multiple narrow-band pipes.&quot; So if you have the money, there are solutions for getting higher bandwidth.",1380146249

6447514,comment,6446077,6446077,3,0,everest81,,,"Some perspective from Nepali side, even though I don&#x27;t reside there now I go back quite often. Airport in Nepal has separate line/queue for emigration for these workers going to arab countries like Qatar. Every day 100s of such workers emigrate out of Nepal, all carrying dream of earning a decent living and sending money back for family. As much as it pains me to say this, some of those workers have no better option in Nepal. In my village itself, I&#x27;ve seen hoards of supposed lower caste people make a better living for themselves because of earnings/money sent back by their sons/husbands from Qatar and other countries. They were neglected by upper caste/government before and now they are neglected by another country. Problem lies with Nepal, the government more than anything. Everyone who aspires to go abroad thinks or believes it won&#x27;t happen to them, but they don&#x27;t know the bad conditions waiting for them until they leave. And as the article states, in most cases they take loans, sell farmland(if they&#x27;ve any) and build up a sizable debt before setting food abroad. 
What can be done to help the situation? Fixing problems from Nepali side aside, it would help if Fifa would strip Qatar of the WC all together, but not likely as they were bribed in first place anyways. It would also help if bigger entities(US, UK) put pressure on Fifa in the regards.",1380145763

First, each &quot;modification&quot; generates garbage; garbage on the JVM has different collection costs  from virtually nonexistent to quite significant  but persistent DS <i>might</i> generate the most expensive kind of garbage: medium-duration-lived objects. The second is caching effects. Mutable data structures reuse cache lines, while persistent DS cause cache faults and pollute the cache. Clojure&#x27;s transients help with that. Of course, persistence is an essential element of Clojure&#x27;s beautiful values-and-states philosophy, so you do get something extremely valuable in exchange for some performance cost.<p>There&#x27;s another issue with persistent DS: they can&#x27;t be concurrently modified; they allow only one writer at a time.

But we are going to claim in a rather strange way that this is not really true.</i><p><i>First of all, it is not really about science. It is really much more about engineering or art than it is about science.
...and it is not really about computers. Now that definitely
sounds strange! But let me tell you why I claim it is not really about computers. I claim it is not really about computers in the same way that physics is not really just about particle accelerators, or biology is not really just about microscopes, or geometry is not really about surveying instruments.</i><p><i>In fact, geometry is a good analogy to use here. It has also a terrible name, which comes from two words: GHIA
or earth, and METRA or measurement. And to the ancient Egyptians, that is exactly what geometry was -- instruments for measuring the earth, or surveying. Thousands of years ago, the Nile annually flooded, and eventually retreated, wiping out most of the identifying landmarks. It also deposited rich soil in its wake, making the land that it flooded very valuable, but also very hard to keep track of.</i><p><i>As a consequence, the Egyptian priesthood had to arbitrate the restoration of land boundaries after the annual flooding. Since there were no landmarks, they needed a better way of determining boundaries, and they invented geometry, or earth measuring. Hence, to the Egyptians, geometry was surveying -- and about surveying instruments. This is a common effect. When a field is just getting started, its easy to confuse the essence of the field with its tools, because we usually understand the tools much less well in the infancy of an area. In hindsight, we realize that the important essence of what the Egyptians did was to formalize the notions of space and time which later led to axiomatic methods for dealing with declarative, or What Is kinds of knowledge. --- So geometry not really about measuring devices, but rather about declarative knowledge.</i><p><i>So geometry is not really about surveying, it is actually
fundamentally about axioms for dealing with a particular kind of knowledge, known as Declarative, or &quot;what is true&quot;
knowledge.</i><p><i>By analogy to geometry, Computer Science is not really about computers -- it is not about the tool. It is actually about the kind of knowledge that computer science makes available to us. What we are going to see in this course is that computer science is dealing with a different kind of knowledge -- Imperative or &quot;how to&quot; knowledge. It is trying to capture the notion of a process that causes information to evolve from one state to another, and we want to see how we can uses methods to capture that knowledge</i><p><a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/lecture-notes/lecture1webhand.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-comput...</a>",1380145275

It indicates a glottal stop. Most words in lojban start with a consonant, so glottal stops are placed before words that begin with a vowel (mainly just attitudinals and names). This is to prevent words from flowing into one another when speaking rapidly, which is important since one of the design goals of lojban is to avoid ambiguity.<p>{.i} is actually punctuation: it marks the boundary between sentences. All punctuation is pronounced in lojban. This may sound exhausting, but again, it reduces ambiguity.<p>{ge&#x27;edai} is intended to mean &quot;I know that feel&quot; -- {ge&#x27;e} meaning &quot;unspecified emotion&quot; and {dai} meaning &quot;empathy&quot; -- but I&#x27;m not sure if combining them is grammatically correct.

That is not something Apple&#x27;s snappy interfaces deliver -- you are only free to use iOS for the things Apple approves, and subverting that control (i.e. jailbreaking) is no less intimidating than using a modern GNU/Linux distro.<p>My experience has been that deliberate restrictions on software use affect non-technical people as much as they affect me:<p>&quot;What does &#x27;activation failed&#x27; mean?&quot;<p>&quot;Why can&#x27;t I copy this DVD?&quot;<p>&quot;I want to record this TV show and then watch it on my tablet, how do I copy it from my DVR?&quot;<p>&quot;My friend had that app, why can&#x27;t I find it in the app store?  How do I install it?&quot;<p>Dismissing the freedoms offered by Free software as abstract and inaccessible ignores the reality of how people use their computers.  Nobody is claiming that someone who never touched a computer in their life is going to be hacking the kernel, but it is not far-fetched to think that they might want to copy a movie or that they might be angry if their books mysteriously disappear one night.  The snappy UI is little more than bait -- it is attractive to people who are frustrated by more complicated systems, but hidden behind it is a system that denies people the right to use their computers they way they want to use their computers.  In other words, what I said in my comment:  an attempt to take advantage of technical ignorance.",1380144453

There are no overflows, unless you count running out of RAM to store your numbers as an overflow.  Modular arithmetic must be explicitly specified, leaving no room for surprises:<p><pre><code>  (mod (+ x y) N)
</code></pre>
The reason I prefer this behavior to C&#x27;s is that it is more natural.  Most of the time when we think of integer arithmetic, we do not assume that it is modulo N; we assume things like &quot; x - 1 < x &quot; will always be true.  Forcing unexpected semantics on programmers is a recipe for bugs, and integer underflow/overflow bugs are not uncommon in C programs.",1380143214

The methane you use for cooking (&quot;natural gas&quot;) has an odor added to it artificially for safety.",1380142928

You&#x27;re basically asking for a part-time contract programming gig (or whatever your specialty equates to); I&#x27;ve done those at times for tidy sums. Smaller &#x27;50s-ish homes exist and are quite affordable; you could also save up the cash and build your own (I just found a nice half-acre rural lot in driving distance of work for $1700, and a workable 2-story small-frame &quot;house&quot; is available from Home Depot for about $8000 (you add amenities over time)). Cars can be had cheap, downgrade to a cheap prepaid dumphone no-data plan, rediscover frugal living, and you&#x27;ll work it out. I very nearly did the same, until I got married and she had pricier standards.<p>And once Obamacare kicks in, there might suddenly be a lot of companies looking for &quot;part time&quot; workers interested in 1950s-level health care plans (to wit: none). You asked at just the right time!",1380142911

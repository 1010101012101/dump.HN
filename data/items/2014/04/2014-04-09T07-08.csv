7558162,comment,7557089,7557465,9,0,exDM69,,,"> Many are saying that one problem with Haskell is that you can&#x27;t eliminate side-channel attacks due to features of the language. I disagree. There is no common language better than Haskell at encoding invariants in the type system. One could, for example, implement a &quot;biggishnum&quot; library in Haskell using large but fixed size integers and constant-time operations.<p>Why do you disagree?<p>Timing attacks are probably the easiest kind of side channel attacks to prevent but CPU cache line eviction and branch prediction are a lot more difficult to deal with. Especially when using a programming language with managed memory where you can&#x27;t be quite sure what kind of memory accesses a program will perform. And in the days of virtual machines on cloud servers, they are very relevant.<p>I do not think that it is totally impossible to write Haskell crypto code without any side channels, it is certainly more difficult than writing crypto code in C or Assembler.<p>But the big problem is that now you&#x27;d need the programmers dealing with crypto not only to be proficient cryptographers but also experts on the internals of the Haskell runtime system. That&#x27;s a pretty tall order.<p>I would like to hear from the original authors of this library, what was their motivation in starting this project? I am sure they were not unaware of the potential of side channel attacks. I don&#x27;t think this project was started with the intention of replacing OpenSSL in production use, but perhaps for fun or educational purposes. Or perhaps to write offline tools for creating and validating certificates, etc.",1397030175

7558154,comment,7555234,7555234,1,0,millstone,,,"There&#x27;s not much in the way of contrary opinion here, so let me offer some. The approach of not tying you to a particular architecture is fundamentally wrong. The right way is to expose APIs for each processor architecture.<p>Here&#x27;s why. SIMD offers no new capabilities (1), only more speed, and not much more at that, maybe 4x if you&#x27;re lucky. It&#x27;s also hard to use: it requires unnatural data layouts, and lacks many operations (e.g. integer division). None of this is specific to the .NET implementation: it&#x27;s just the nature of the beast.<p>So successfully exploiting SIMD is not easy, and requires thinking at the level where instruction counts matter. And because the amount of parallelism is so limited, high level languages (by which I include C!) can very easily blow away any gains with suboptimal codegen. Just a handful of additional instructions can ruin your performance (2).<p>Here&#x27;s what will go wrong with an architecture-independent SIMD API:<p>1. Say you invoke an operation without an underlying native instruction. The compiler is forced to implement this by transferring the data to scalar registers, performing the operation, and then transferring the result back. Game over: this exercise is likely to eat up any performance benefit.<p>2. To avoid this, say you limit the API to some &quot;common subset&quot; of all extant SIMD ISAs. The problem is, many algorithms admit vectorization only through the exotic instructions, such as POPCNT on SSE4, or the legendary vec_perm on Altivec. If this instruction is not exposed, you can&#x27;t vectorize the algorithm. Game over again.<p>That&#x27;s why software that takes advantage of SIMD invariably has separate implementations for each supported ISA. .NET should have followed suit: expose an API for each ISA (or a mega-API that covers all ISAs), and then provide rich information about which operations are implemented efficiently, and which are not, to allow apps to choose an optimal implementation at runtime. This API would demo and market very poorly, but the engineers will love it, because it&#x27;s the one that enables the most benefit from SIMD.<p>1: with rare exceptions, such as the new fused multiply-add support in x86<p>2: Several years back, VC++ generated an all-bits-1 register by loading it from memory, instead of issuing a pcmpeqd, which caused my vector implementation to underperform my scalar one. This is my fear for the .NET implementation.",1397029909
7558153,comment,7556407,7556862,4,0,a3_nm,,,"> You still have to warn the user that their desire for a secure connection (conveyed by their request to retrieve an https URL) cannot be fulfilled<p>Normal users do not enter URLs in their browsers, much less https ones, and do not pay attention to the https prefix when clicking a link or pasting an URL, so the client retrieving an https URL usually does not indicate a desire from the user to have a secure connection.<p>I believe that users have been trained to pay attention to the presence of padlocks and colors in the address bar, not to the presence of the &quot;https&quot; prefix, so that self-signed HTTPS could look the same as plain HTTP from that perspective and I don&#x27;t believe security harm would ensue.<p>> There is very little self-signed HTTPS traffic out there. The NSA assuredly has the resources to MITM all of it.<p>I find this doubtful. I am willing to believe that the NSA might be passively snooping on a large portion of HTTP traffic, but performing active attacks, even when you have the resources, is a lot harder to be doing smartly (unlike passive attacks, which are invisible).<p>If the NSA were routinely MITMing self-signed HTTPS traffic, knowledgeable users would have noticed. They would be investigating under which conditions, and along which routes, does the MITM take place. As nobody seems to have witnessed this, I doubt that is happening now, or that it is likely to happen in an indiscriminate way.<p>> You might be willing to gamble your own security, but you should not gamble everyone&#x27;s security.<p>Even then, how is MITMed HTTPS traffic worse than passively monitored, and potentientally MITMable, HTTP traffic?<p>As for your point about training users to ignore security warnings: blame the browsers, not the websites. If using self-signed HTTPS is no worse than HTTP, those messages are stupid, and I&#x27;m not going to give up on the additional security of self-signed HTTPS just because browsers are doing something stupid with it.",1397029901

When you graduate from that prison, you are finally free to find like-minded nerds and do interesting things together with them. Of course, as you said, the whole world might be just another prison that demands compliance with the status quo.

7558077,comment,7556752,7556752,22,0,peterwwillis,,,"I wonder if this author is aware that OpenSSL was once born from a different project, called SSLeay, started way back in 1995. Abbreviated history lesson:<p>--<p>People today get pissed off because RSA got paid by the NSA to make crypto weaker, but try living in a time when RSA literally controlled the entire trade of tools used to run the web securely, and could just prevent anyone in the US from using SSL if they didn&#x27;t pay for it. It&#x27;s funny that actually all the people who originally worked on getting SSL created or its implementation into free software eventually worked for RSA. Ironically, back in the day NSA invested millions in a campaign to destroy RSA by offering its own competing cryptosystem as the new defacto standard.<p>SSL was basically created by Netscape through the work of Taher Elgamal, whose name you might recognize. In the 80s he created a variety of cryptosystems, many of which we still use today in a variety of applications. SSL was created with RSA&#x27;s cryptosystems and patented algorithms to provide the most security in the fastest way possible for web users. Since all of RSA&#x27;s algorithms were patented, nobody could implement them (for commercial purposes) without licensing it from RSA. Strong crypto (anything over 40 bits) was also still considered &#x27;munitions&#x27; and not allowed to be exported out of the country.<p>Back then there wasn&#x27;t a great big free unified toolkit of crypto libraries for anyone to use. The people who were writing crypto software either worked for a university, or a corporation, or a government, and thus all had the tendency to keep their source code to themselves, and code and libraries were licensed instead of given out freely. But a mini revolution had started from the ashes of the homebrew/shareware communities. People started to create free software and give it away at no charge, there were people interested in making web servers and the like, and they could all share one standard library (for things like crypto) so they didn&#x27;t all have to implement one themselves for every project.<p>SSLeay was created in order to have a free implementation of SSL and its cryptographic algorithms that wouldn&#x27;t be subject to US export controls. This was reportedly a &quot;clean room&quot; implementation derived only from documentation, written from scratch by Eric Young in Australia in 1995. It was then used by Tim Hudson in America (amongst others) to add SSL support to basically every free application that could use it, like telnet, ftp, ncsa mosaic & httpd, apache, w3c httpd, lynx, mSQL, etc. Both these men later went on to create commerial versions of this library and leave the work on SSLeay behind, and from that was born the OpenSSL project to continue where they left off.<p>At the time it was possible to create and run free software that provided SSL access. Actually, companies like Verisign - the only CA allowed by some browsers, for a while - had to make policy changes to start allowing certs to be generated for Apache-enabled SSL sites. But it was not <i>legal</i> to make free SSL-enabled software in the US because the right algorithms had not been licensed by RSA to use in the states. It also wasn&#x27;t legal to export any strong crypto from the country. You could only use things like Apache with SSL if you purchased a licensed add-on for use in the US, or applied a mod_ssl patch for use outside of the US.<p>Browsers were in a much worse boat [because they all depended on RSA if they wanted strong encryption] and thus were largely commercial ventures. When Netscape released its source code for the first time under the Mozilla label, all its strong crypto was removed to comply with US laws. A new project (Cryptozilla) had to be created to link SSLeay to the sources. It was then that the rest of the world could finally download a robust, modern, open-source browser with strong crypto.<p>All of this changed in 2000 when the RSA patents fell into the public domain and the US relaxed its export controls on crypto software. Right after that, Mozilla bundled its own RSA implementation in its NSS crypto library, and the rest (for Mozilla) had nothing to do with SSLeay or OpenSSL. But SSLeay (now OpenSSL) continued to be used by software all over the world.<p>--<p>There were a lot of different implementations of SSL/TLS with varying degrees of compatibility bugs. Most of the time a web server was developed in tandem with a web browser (or other similar client/server tools), and a library was created to implement the protocols they needed. This, of course, led to various problems between different implementations, even though if it was web code it was all using the same RSA toolkit for the relevant ciphers.<p>Even since those days in the mid-1990s, it&#x27;s been obvious that a single library to handle all the weird implementations is both difficult to implement and very useful to developers. It&#x27;s never been easy or bug-free. But even at the time, the library was written and re-written to get around things like export controls (the BSAFE SSL-C library was a rewritten version of SSLeay, by its original authors, so their new company could sell it as a non-US-based implementation of a US-patented algorithm).<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s offensive to the spirit of the original authors (or current developers) to suggest a fork or a rewrite. The main goals of OpenSSL are to have a free software implementation of SSL and TLS, and secondarily to provide a full-strength general-purpose cryptography library. It&#x27;s not some abominable, indecipherable, impossible task to re-accomplish this. Hell, it was originally done by one ozzie by himself with just docs for reference. I think maybe the entire open source community can handle organizing a do-over.<p>--<p>(Side note: does anyone else realize that the HTML <keygen> tag has been around since Netscape Navigator 3, and still nobody uses it?)",1397027897

It&#x27;s not the &quot;weeeeew college&quot; level of partying from freshmen year, I would say it has little to no impact anymore on my grades.<p>One last relevant fact, it took me 3 tries to pass calculus, in highschool I was passed in precalc because the teacher knew I was involved in a lot of work after a botched computer donation program to our neighboring schools. This year I had to self-teach myself a lot which was tough, and the few times I did see my professor or TA they would only explain the material covered in class. To quote &quot;I&#x27;m not here to teach you algebra/calculus&quot;. That is totally reasonable but having to have a logarithm cheat sheet with you at review sessions kinda sucks, not to mention I got shot down enough times early on where I would second guess asking questions for fear of them being too elementary.<p>I&#x27;m aware I fucked this up, but I really do love to code. It&#x27;s the only thing i&#x27;m (ironically) not burned out on.",1397027279

7558036,comment,7557089,7557198,6,0,PeterisP,,,"I&#x27;d rather say that the long list of overflow-related vulnerabilities would be a good argument to ensure that all crypto libraries are implemented in some kind of a strict language that disallows a large class of vulnerabilities, even if it costs us some time and effort.<p>Seriously, for many languages bugs cause unintended behavior <i>within bounds of implemented logic</i> - such as the recent logic bug that returned an &#x27;okay&#x27; response even if the certificate was invalid; however, the fact that ordinary bugs tend to have effects of &quot;read arbitrary memory&quot; or &quot;execute arbitrary code&quot; is a very specific niche of C and friends.<p>In a language appropriate for security, a bug in heartbeat extension would break the heartbeat extension - maybe disable heartbeats not work, maybe cause different heartbeats - but it should be unable to affect the rest of application. In a language appropriate for security, if a single module is secure (i.e., the limited number of API/method calls it exposes are secure), then bugs in all other modules shouldn&#x27;t be able to affect the insides of that module; so if your app has a tiny core that does some signing w/o exposing the key secrets, then the rest of the app can&#x27;t touch it even deliberately, much less by an acidental bug.",1397027059

Nerds choose to be intelligent rather than popular. He offers some relief to young nerds by informing them that, in the real life hierarchy of success, nerds have the advantage and jocks don&#x27;t.<p>In my response, I argue that a nerd who deviates from the status quo still meets relentless opposition to real world success; perhaps even more so than a nerdy jock who deviates from the status quo path to popularity.",1397026899

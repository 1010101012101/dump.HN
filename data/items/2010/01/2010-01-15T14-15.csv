But when realigning at runtime, you don't, so you need to compute the difference and then store that somewhere, and on return you have to read that back and add it to the stack pointer.<p>Or is there some trick that I'm missing?",1263567486

1054970,comment,1054392,1054542,0,0,bradgessler,,,"You're correct, the breakdown for a monthly SMS fee is $500-$1,000 (for a 'vanity' short code) <i>just</i> to hand on to the name (think of it as paying $500 for a domain name of a random sequence of characters or $1000 for a domain of your choosing).<p>It doesn't stop there thought. Typically you have to pay an aggregator to send and receive messages from the cell networks. This usually costs thousands of dollars and is broken down between a monthly fixed cost or a cost per message (typically $0.04-$0.05 per outgoing message or $0.01 per incoming message).<p>But that's not for fund raising short codes. If you're a corporation, the cellphone companies take anywhere from 50%-75% of the amount that is to be billed to the customer; however, this number is much lower for non-profits. The caveat though is that not many non-profit organizations are approved for these lower rates; companies like mGive and MobileCause have to do a lot of work to get this clearance from cellular phone companies and act as an aggregator for non-profits.<p>Oh, and there's one more thing: the application process, which is a fucking nightmare. It takes 3-6 months to get a non-charging short code and thousands of dollars without any guarantee of approval. Worse yet, each cellular network has to approve of your application so if all US cellphone companies approve, but one like Verizon says, ""No, sorry,"" you're screwed. When our company went through this process, one cell provider said, ""No,"" at first, and then asked us for a sample of the SMS messages that we would send and receive.<p>Net net: its a fucking mess out there in the SMS short code world. If you want to see what a world of non-net-netruality looks like, look no further than cellular providers.",1263567444

Nothing special.<p>But the odd thing was that even though the score increased dramatically from 1 to 5 in just 10-15 minutes, the ranking didn't change that much. Used to be that an increase of that much would get you near the top of the front page, if even for a little bit.<p>I'm not complaining, just figured somebody somewhere was tinkering or it was some kind of effect of karma inflation. However it does bring up an interesting point about UI design and large groups of users -- any non-obvious new system behavior can easily be interpreted in lots of ways, some of which aren't so flattering to the board owners.<p>FWIW, I've always thought this behavior was a bug. If I thought my vote was being taken and then returned to me at random times depending on the ""smarts"" of the system without notifying me why, I'd be pretty mad. I understand that it's already happening with deep threads and the first time I stumbled across it I was so mad I was ready to just throw in the towel on HN.<p>Not exactly a happy user experience, but yes, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one. Just a better job of communicating would salve a lot of these hurt feelings, in my opinion.",1263565536

I have had teachers who prefer an answer which speaks for my understanding of the concept rather than rewriting (or what they called vomitting) of what is in the text book. They were my real inspiration. I have had teachers in the other side too.<p>I had made up my mind to become a software engineer in 1996 after seeing a paint program made completely in BASIC by our physics teacher. When the day came to choose my career, there was opposition. It was 2002; things weren't looking good for a software engineer then. Inspite of the stiff opposition of the so called ""people around me"" my parents fully supported in choosing CS. It was definitely not because I would make a lot of money.<p>I bump into people with similar experience almost everyday in my life. People who chose CS over doctor; people who are singers and not engineers; people who run their own factory instead of working in an MNC; people who work in ""techy"" jobs when MBA/Management is the order of the day and people who just do what they want to do. It all boils down to the guts you have and to some extent the ability to earn the trust of people who matter to you.<p>Simply blaming on the system is not acceptable to me. If you feel you are right, stand up to it. Convince people who think you are wrong. If you feel it's not your job, don't expect to be spoon fed.

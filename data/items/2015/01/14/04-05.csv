8884404,comment,8884069,8884069,0,0,crdoconnor,,,">The Luddites tried futilely to stop progress that benefited society<p>Luddites were not anti-technology nor were they anti progress. They destroyed technology as a tactic to raise the price of the more automated competition. Their competition made cheaper, crappier equivalents of their artisanal work made with de-skilled McJob equivalent workers whose wages were pressured to abhorrent levels (via other means like the enclosure movement/Napoleonic wars).<p>Similarly, people who strike are not &quot;futilely trying to stop the existence of work&quot;. It&#x27;s another tactic.<p>In a way, the Luddites are pretty similar to the anti-H1B crowd of hacker news.<p>>Before these technological advancements, workers enjoyed mini-monopolies.<p>This is a hacky way of looking at it but the conclusion sort of works. It makes much more sense to look at relative market power of employees vs. employers rather than use the all-or-nothing terminology of monopoly vs. perfect competition.<p>If Amazon workers attempt to sabotage Amazon&#x27;s stock picking machinery, I expect it will result in an increase in wages, much like it did for the Luddites. They will be <i>called</i> Luddites, but similar to the original Luddites, they kind of only really have a problem with technology that is used to control them.",1421211499

8884400,comment,8881744,8884021,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"You are right, but there&#x27;s a huge obstacle in the form of people who trumpet the notion of liberty (for some) while simultaneously supporting draconian/authoritarian policies for other people, and who make up a fairly solid political constituency. Even people who don&#x27;t necessarily approve of such policies are strongly conditioned to accept them through their incessant repetition on television shows, news, and so forth. Producers of such shows aren&#x27;t necessarily part of a secret conspiracy to scare the populace - although you could wonder about their network buyers - but are simply trying to provide engaging entertainment, and police shows reliably draw large audience, as do detective shows and stories. I&#x27;m not immune from this, I love a good detective story.<p>The net effect is an ideological structure within which the distribution of power becomes further entrenched. No conspiracy to engineer such an outcome is required; like many other social phenomena, it can emerge naturally due to market forces, and is arguably a unintentional by-product of the economic and political structures.",1421211418

Reason is this isn&#x27;t a technical problem, it&#x27;s a social one.<p>One of the things that the recruiter who found me my job did for me was to interact with the company for me. I told him my concerns, and he either talked me through them or relayed them, through the filter of someone whose seen this all before, to the company. Had I had to do this directly with the company, I wouldn&#x27;t have done so well, and I might have gotten passed over.<p>When my company wanted to keep me on a contract basis three months after his job was technically over, and I was prepared to walk, I called him, and he calmed everyone down and got the company to bring me on full time. Had I had to negotiate it myself, I might have said something unwise and a bad decision would have been made.<p>Now that I&#x27;m on the other side of the table, I find myself playing the same role my recruiter played for me as far as the interpersonal dynamics is concerned. I talk through his concerns, I discuss the money aspect with him, advocate his case, and protect him from HR bullshit.<p>I don&#x27;t see a purely online web agent as bringing any more value to the table than (just another) job board.",1421211283

It&#x27;s worth recognizing the power of gerrymandering and money in elections. But, that&#x27;s another discussion. There is no such thing as a viable political candidate who discusses reigning in police power...not because of the voting public. In America we choose between two parties who have differences, but there are entire categories of governance on which they are in lock step. Police is one of those categories. You will never hear a Republican or a Democrat suggest abolition of the institution of police as we know it, or even demanding basic accountability for killer cops.<p>Short of revolution, the only effective tools citizens have is to educate more people about the problems (and the cost of &quot;tough on crime&quot; policies), protest the clear human rights violations, film police so there are fewer invisible victims, demand accountability from city councils and mayors and police chiefs, etc. And, I do a little bit of all of these things (there&#x27;s a Black Lives Matter march on Saturday here in Austin; I&#x27;ll be there).<p>So, yes, many Americans are stupid, violent, poorly-educated, racist, and vindictive, or at least support law enforcement that is all of those things. But, the number of people who support no-knock raids is surely not high enough to claim the people chose this (I don&#x27;t know, but I can&#x27;t imagine it would be).",1421211123

Samsung seems to clearly have the best screen tech/market-share combination. By partnering with them they prevent samsung from copying them anyway and potentially not giving them access to the screens, also if Oculus was smart they agreed but with a non-compete or exclusivity clause so that Samsung doesn&#x27;t provide competitors screens. Also Samsung probably has the most resources besides Apple to actually be modifying/manufacturing customer hardware/software innovations that are requirement for future versions of Oculus.<p>Re: Gear VR, I think it&#x27;s very impressive. Definitely better than the DK2. You don&#x27;t miss positional tracking as much as you&#x27;d think when you get wire-free and light/polished product experience. The Crescent Bay demo was definitely better than both, but Gear VR is your best bet right now for experimenting and promoting your experiments. Being able to walk up to people just show them your demo is priceless and powerful. I&#x27;d shown maybe 10 people my DK2, I&#x27;ve already shown probably 100. I brought it into work, I brought it meetups, etc.<p>Caveat: I was due for an upgrade from my iPhone 4S and wanted to tryout Android for a generation, so getting the Galaxy Note 4 was logical so that I could kick in the $200US for a Gear VR.

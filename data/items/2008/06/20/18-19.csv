Queries such as ""square"", ""blue"", ""fast"", etc... will yield very poor results.<p>PLSI tends to perform very well on more specific queries, such as ""Paul Graham"", ""silicon graphics"", etc...<p>The problem with PLSI is that it is extremely computationally expensive -- which is why most internet-scale search engines don't use it.<p>Our innovation was figuring out some tricks that have allowed us to improve performance dramatically. However, there is obviously still room for improvement.<p>Our goal is to satisfy 80% of the queries with decent results -- and to leave the other 20% (square, etc...) to someone else.<p>The interesting thing about PLSI is that it's able to rank documents from the text alone -- ignoring the link structure and other metadata.<p>Therefore, we're thinking our algorithm will make the most sense in situations where there is lots of textual data without web-like link metadata.<p>The two scenarios that come to mind where people need to text-mine documents outside the metadata-rich web are:\n(1) windows file shares on corporate intranets\n(2) large volumes of legal documents inside law firms<p>Text-mining wikipedia is a proof-of-concept at this point",1213987407

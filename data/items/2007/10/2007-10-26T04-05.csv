72805,comment,72513,72618,0,0,rontr,,,"""Superstar"" is a word that should be reserved for a select few. For example, the hackers who built the Google search engine are superstars. I somehow doubt people of such caliber send their resumes to Fog Creek Software seeking opportunities to maintain aging enterprise bug tracking software.<p>This article reads to me like a thinly veiled recruitment effort. ""Work for me and I'll appreciate your contribution, only ask you to work 40 hours a week, and even call you 'superstar'!""<p>I'd rather start a startup.",1193374603

For non-trivial queries, it is also likely to be <i>at least</i> as efficient as your home-grown search package is likely to be, unless you put a lot of effort into optimizing it yourself.<p>But hey, rolling your own text search from scratch is fun, so don't let me stop you :)",1193374001

72799,comment,72770,72798,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Uh, we didn't say that. We said _our robots_ _will eventually_ be able to go wherever people can go, including stairs and maybe ladders. They currently are restricted to floors with small random crap on them. <p>The point of the wherever-people-can-go idea is that the whole Anybots vision of the robotics market in the next 20 years is that AI won't be production-ready, but teleoperated robots will certainly be production ready. So, we merely have to design robots and software that can smoothly allow a remote operator to behave as if (s)he is actually in the environment the robot is in, and perform tasks that way. In particular, this involves going most places people can go. <p>So, we have a big bank of monitors that displays a big panorama fusing all of Monty's cameras, so the operator can see what's going on, and a glove and backpack operation that allows the operator's movements to be sent back to the robot.

That's really good motivation for mot young (straight) guys.<p>My guess, too much fun can get distracting, hence NYC startups will be less successful than SV ones.

72790,story,,,12,14,kyro,"I have found a potential team, but...",,"So here I am again asking for your knowledge and expertise.<p>I am currently taking an entrepreneurship class, and in this class we were all required to write up a two page pitch of a product or service idea. We were then given a certain amount of virtual points that we could use to invest in the projects we found interesting and profitable, and the top 2 would have to pick teams for a mock startup. My project came in first, and after responding to some grilling questions from the professor today, I was approached by 3 other students. These students expressed great interest in being part of my team, which is great, but I soon realized that they wanted to create a real team to pursue the development of my idea. I was flattered and excited, and we have exchanged emails to talk about it even further, but after giving it some thought, I grew a bit apprehensive.<p>I'm not sure if these folks are rockstar hackers, or have the strength to endure a startup. I don't want to jump into this on a high of excitement with people that perhaps might not be fit for it. So, I ask you, how do I go about deciphering whether these guys are persons who are smart, talented, and have a strong personality to undertake such a task? I want to go about this the smart and right way, because I know emotions can fog up the intellect and really mess up your decisions.<p>Thanks.",1193372305

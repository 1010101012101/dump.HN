Men get taken advantage of too, but that doesn't excuse what is effectively a hit piece on an entire industry.<p>""Additionally your logic is flawed--just because you have never heard anybody complain about the lack of women in blue collar jobs (the only jobs you mentioned) doesn't mean it doesn't happen.""<p>This is true, I admit I'm not a regular jezebel reader and must have missed the article where they mentioned that.

2326369,comment,2325493,2326306,0,0,srean,,,"Not sure if you are the down-voter. But regardless of that I have to say, I totally believed in what you just wrote, said so much myself if you note my last paragraph. But I was naive then. I have come to realize that the situation you describe is mostly hypothetical and fictional...good argument to buy favors...but not one that represents reality. The private companies are not the ones who are spending money or taking the risks in developing new drugs/molecules (it is mostly the tax payers by way of NIH). If it were the companies then I wouldn't mind it all. The companies do spend money. But it is not in the (re)search for more effective or new drugs.<p>Edit: Re govt funding, I have quite a few friends who are in drug research, well, in the capacity of current and ex grad students and spread across 3 universities and a research institute. All of them are fed funded, and they claim that this is generally the rule rather than the exception. In my opinion the privilege of exclusivity should be doled out in proportion to the aggregated (monetary)risks entertained.<p>Edit2: Don't like threads that nest too deep, so adding here. I would readily concede that I wouldn't have names of drugs at the drop of the hat. My opinions are largely assimilated from my friends working in the area and what I get to read. So hardly the person who would be able to quote stats. Recently an application for extending the period of protection for a anti-retroviral drug was denied in India on the grounds that the molecular change adds nothing to the efficacy of the drug and that the molecular changes in itself do not constitute a non-obvious modification to the chemical to a person of the trade. However, denials of extension like these are very very rare. It is common to keep extending a patent on an old molecule in quantums of decades at a time  (Now I wish I had it bookmarked)<p>However I think your test is stricter than need be. As I said, I am looking for proportionality between risk taken and period of exclusivity. That can be broken even if the govt did not carry the full weight from end to end (the example that you are seeking). Generally it is the research phase that incurs the most uncertainty and the kind of research that targets greater efficiency or cheaper production, not what will get the drug or derivative an extended protection.<p>In the context of the older Indian scene, it was the govt funded labs that carried out the research, so it made perfect sense that patents be granted on the process and not on the compound. It also makes sense for the govt to be in the business of funding drug research as for many of the diseases the affected demographics are not most lucrative. (Well unless one is of the opinion that such a population is better of dead, not an unheard of opinion on the net) The research scene is still the same but the laws have been changed subject to international pressure.<p>There is substantial benefit to be had by driving costs down. In the current scheme of things there are very little incentives to do so.",1300172086

The elephant in THAT room is race.<p>The truth is, both the prison system and the murder culture are HIGHLY skewed against black men. If you look at white people in the U.S., 4600 men were killed in 1999, and 2000 women.  White men are roughly twice as likely to be killed as white women.<p>If you look at black people, 5500 black men were killed, versus 1000 black women. And let me remind you that black people make up something like 10% of the population.<p>The situation is similar for incarceration rates.<p>So, two takeaway points here:<p>1) If you're a black man, and a white woman is complaining to you about the sexism she faced in her VC pitch, you may have a right to bring up the Oppression Olympics card.<p>2) If you're a white man, crying about how horrible is the specter of you getting murdered or sent to jail, in the middle of a conversation about sexism... you're just making excuses. Your likelihood of going to jail or being murdered is much closer to a white woman's.<p>And the truth is, men commit a much higher portion of violent crime. It's not like women are out there murdering thousands of men every year and getting away with it.<p>Although white people do sell a lot more drugs than black people and get away with it.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/offenses/expanded_information/data/shrtable_01.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/offenses/expanded_informati...</a>",1300171160

Stuff like this ""Homicide as defined here includes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter which is the willful killing of one human being by another. The general analyses excluded deaths caused by negligence, suicide, or accident; justifiable homicides; and attempts to murder. "" So we're saying vehicular manslaughter and shooting somebody in the head are the same while in reality they are completely different. Would you say that if you accidentally kill hit somebody and they die this is a murder? I wouldn't. But those cases get tacked on and divided and put through algorithms under the auspice of nurder.    Additionally this ""While many agencies report supplemental data on homicides, much of the data concerning offenders may not be reported because no suspects were identified. The most significant problem in using SHR data to analyze offender characteristics is the sizable and growing number of unsolved homicides contained in the data file. ""  So they guess based on what they do know, I have a problem with that. ""In other words, offender profiles for unsolved crimes are estimated based on the offender profiles in solved cases matched on victim age, sex, and race; circumstances of the homicide; location of the homicide; and gun involvement; as well as year. All offender-based estimates were imputed using this procedure. ""<p>Those are only a few excerpts that cast doubt on the true validity of the DOJ stats.

It boils down to the fact that the market is fairly efficient ""most"" of the time (hard to find deals), and by trading you are already at a disadvantage against the market because you will likely pay more commission and pay more taxes (based on your trading volume of course, but generally speaking, buying index funds are extremely efficient in both these two areas).  To over come this and still beat the market as a whole (over a long period of time and risk-adjusted) is a extremely difficult.  You have to be very very skilled to accomplish this.  Most pros do not accomplish this in their careers (even though it may be due to other factors such as incentive structures, but that's for another discussion).  So realistically speaking, you will have to invest a lot of time to become ""good enough"", which means it will only be worth while if you are trading a significant amount of money.

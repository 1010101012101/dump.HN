9123122,comment,9122552,9122552,0,0,mylocalgood,,,"Id just say after juggling family, new startup incubation and day job & surviving this, here are some takeaways:<p>1. Stay Really Hydrated. A lot of tiredness is thirst and muscles being sore from not having enough water. A good way to determine this is to do about 30 jumping jacks next to your desk and about 20 high-knees (I Kid you not). If your muscles burn, you havent had enough water and that probably also led to sleep problems.<p>2. Take power naps which remove mental stress. Here&#x27;s a technique: Start counting down from 100 very slowly.
After each number, repeat to yourself quietly SLOW DOWN. Dont say &quot;RELAX&quot; or &quot;I NEED TO SLEEP&quot; or any of that crap. Just say SLOW DOWN. All the brain needs to do is to slow down.<p>3. Cut out the caffeine and Start EXERCISING. Download the &quot;7 minute workout&quot; app on Android. Its a great uncomfortable routine which&#x27;ll have your heart pumping in 7 minutes. You&#x27;ll suddenly feel hungrier about 30 min after this and itll get the habit started<p>4. Increase circulation at home - stale air is tiring<p>5. Eat the right food. Also have an Organic protein supplement (like Orgain) from Costco.<p>This worked for me.",1425110264

Great clips has over 3,000 locations.  Anthem, a company with multiple billions of dollars in revenue that handles extremely sensitive information for millions of people.<p>I remember as a kid, there was a family owned comic book shop I would visit.  I would let them know what comics I&#x27;m interested in, and they would call me if they got something in that they thought I would be interested in.  So they had good reason to have our phone number. It was probably even stored really insecurely (on a piece of paper).  But it was the early 90&#x27;s.  And if someone stole it it might have included 200 phone numbers.<p>I buy magic the gathering cards from small card shops across the country.  They need my address to ship it.  Since most of these single store businesses are fairly low tech, I doubt they do too much to protect it.<p>Also, your initial statement also said handle, not collect.  Most brick and mortar stores handle credit card data, although they don&#x27;t collect it.  There&#x27;s even been instances of thieves affixing devices to ATMs and credit card machines that will scan your card data as you slide or insert it.<p>You can collect PII by hosting a static webpage (ip addresses).  Leaking that PII can cause harm to users (DDOS).  This may seem made up but people who make a living off live streaming are fairly regularly DDOS&#x27;d by malicious viewers who figure out their IP.<p>More generally, any leak of data, whether it includes PII or not, will harm a company&#x27;s reputation.<p>This is why I called your post insanely irrational.

A lot of these security auditors(but not all!) are just running automated tools and generating automated reports.  They don&#x27;t understand your environment like you do.  Even a dedicated security guy at a large company can&#x27;t be everywhere and doesn&#x27;t know everything(or even understand, say, hypervisor security).  I was lucky enough to work with/for somebody that was very security concious and involved in the security scene... It changes your thinking.  This thinking while staying <i>pragmatic</i> is the key IMHO.  Just like the mantra &quot;everyone is responsible for quality&quot; I believe everyone should be responsible for security.  If this isn&#x27;t specific enough well.. Consider some of the hacks mentioned before.  It is at the same time completely obvious to some people what went wrong in hindsight, but obviously not apparent to the implementers that it could go wrong at the time.

But, of course, the question we have to ask is &quot;do we really need to be that efficient?&quot; I know nothing about big companies, but here in small business / startup land, the question becomes &quot;do I really need hockey-stick growth?&quot;, &quot;do I really have to release MVP by this hackathon?&quot;, &quot;does it really matter if X invests in me or not?&quot;<p>And time and time again, I&#x27;ve been told the answer was a resounding &quot;yes&quot; by employers, investors, managers, etc., yet when I answered &quot;no&quot; (usually because my inadequate technical skills), the world continued to spin, my business continue to exist, and my technical abilities continued to slowly get better.<p>While the wily freelancer / engineer should always boost his safety margin by telling his boss 6 months minimum when he&#x27;s done it before in 2 months, I&#x27;ve found through experience the best thing to do regarding minimizing my own internal stress is to admit to myself that I don&#x27;t need to be the best, the &quot;A&quot; student, the hotest new company, 30 under 30, or what have you. Instead, it&#x27;s far more critical for me to enjoy my work and make enough money to survive comfortably in 2015.

The fact is, there is no sense pretending (especially to yourself) that you&#x27;re somehow strong or a badass.

Not directly.<p>You see, when you are bootstrapping your revenue is contingent on making deliverables, getting customers (or in my case, donors), and otherwise doing time consuming work. Once you have depleted your savings and maxed out your credit cards, then you really start to feel the life-or-death, make-it-or-die pressure. At every given moment there is permeating risk that if you don’t push this update, if you don’t win that customer/donor, if you don’t make such a looming deadline, you will fail. And failure means the bank taking your house, losing all credit for 7 years, being unable to put food on the table, living on the street, and—let’s face it—owning up to defeat.<p>If that weren’t complicated enough, my wife started her second pregnancy at exactly the same time. Every moment that I was asking my wife how her day was, what the doctor had told her, playing with our other toddler, cooking dinner, or generally just being present was progress not being made towards that deadline, that customer, or a completed product.<p>There’s a pressure and a mentality here not too dissimilar from the gambler that keeps betting double-or-nothing with exponentially increasing risk, chasing the Martingale of success. Before long your entire life is on the table, and you’re rolling the dice. I made it to that point… and then rolled a natural 20. I got lucky. Sure, I “made my own luck” in the sense that a positive outcome was only possible because of all that work I’d put in. But possible does not mean <i>probable</i>, and the upward-trending outcome I am currently enjoying was very, very low probability. I got lucky, and I recognize that.<p>But a year ago? I was deep in a hole and doubling down, while totally ignoring other responsibilities and being unavailable to my wife, daughter, and newborn child. I was trading time now for an imagined future, at terrible odds. I think it was <i>her</i> who had more reason to wonder what kind of person she was married to, and I am eternally grateful that she stayed long enough to make it through.<p>We’re now well funded, making waves, and gathering customers. I’m pulling a steady paycheck and have wiped out the worst of my bad debt. I have a good comp plan with not insignificant equity. But with the information available to me at the outset, I don’t think I would make the same decisions again. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend someone else to do something so foolhardy.

10758766,comment,10753405,10758695,0,0,pron,,,"I didn&#x27;t bustle. A commenter expressed confusion about the meaning of the term, and I provided the common academic definition. Others are welcome to list the full range of colloquial uses.<p>I would, however, note that a physicist <i>would</i> bustle if someone tried to use the word energy with a different meaning <i>when trying to understand a physical process</i>. In this case, the only way to understand what it is that feminists want when it comes to sexism, is to understand what <i>we</i> mean when we use the word, which is also its academic meaning. For example, if you think feminists are against sexism (which we are), but also understand sexism to mean &quot;treating men and women differently&quot;, then you&#x27;d be completely confused as to our goals. Perhaps you&#x27;d think that our goal is to erase the differences between the sexes. That would indeed be a silly goal, and you may be right in getting angry that intelligent people think such rubbish. While in fact, our goal is very clear: correct the gross imbalance of power between the sexes. To achieve that, we seek to uncover the mechanism which perpetuates it, which we call sexism. Thankfully, the academic community has been studying sexism for a few decades, and we now know a thing or two about it.<p>No reason to be angry. In fact, if you understood what feminists mean when we say sexism (which hopefully you now do), I think you&#x27;d be far less angry.",1450450798

It&#x27;s NOT about attraction, its about being, well, creepy. I didn&#x27;t find this out till I started hitting the gym more and gay men started hitting on me more often (I&#x27;m straight and happily married for the record, so it&#x27;s not about me being attracted or not). Here&#x27;s what I learned:<p>If the guy is direct and has a positive attitude I say no but I take it as a compliment. It&#x27;s like a feather in my cap (someone thinks I look good!). If the guy is being weird and indirect about it that gets creepy (and sometimes a little scary). The difference is that the positive guy usually takes the hint if I&#x27;m not interested. If they don&#x27;t take the hint they BECOME creepy. The creepy guy is either so indirect that there&#x27;s no clear way to give a hint, or just refuses to take the hint at all.<p>As I said before, since I&#x27;m straight this isn&#x27;t about whether I&#x27;m attracted to the person or not. It&#x27;s about someone acting in a way that feels creepy or not. It&#x27;s about whether boundaries are being crossed. Finally, I&#x27;ll end by saying that you can be hit on by a good looking person in a creepy way, and flirted with by an ugly person in a very positive way. It&#x27;s all about attitude.",1450450497

And from the students&#x27; side, you get motivated teammates that won&#x27;t complain and try to help each others when you are crashing on a crazy deadline on a Sunday night at 11:42pm.<p>Damn that was great.

There are some caveats if you don&#x27;t have a public website etc, so you have to work around that sometimes.

I understand the good intentions of affirmative action, but I think they cause more harm than good in the long run. To be passed up for a position due to your gender or race, or for a company to hire someone with lower technical qualifications than they&#x27;d normally accept due to gender or race, creates a lot of resentment and cultural issues. This isn&#x27;t just negative opinions at the microscale; it creates a large-scale perception that certain companies or industries are giving preferential treatment, even at the expense of their own productivity and cohesion. Already I see a lot of people complaining about this on various websites, though it&#x27;s probably overexaggerated a bit given that diversity quotas aren&#x27;t that popular with US companies relative to many European countries (yet).<p>Even worse, it also might <i>encourage</i> more division and more prejudice towards those minority groups. If a company gives preferential treatment to hiring women, then what are many coworkers going to inevitably think when a woman makes a mistake or something? &quot;You only got hired here because you&#x27;re a woman.&quot; And in that case, they actually have some empirical backing for that assumption. I don&#x27;t belong to a minority group, but I feel like the anxiety of other people wondering or believing I only (or primarily) got into a certain place because of my gender or race, and not my qualifications, would be very uncomfortable and demotivating. Some people may already think that even when it&#x27;s plainly not true, but a lot more people will think it if it starts becoming more true more often. Not to mention, on top of that, fear that maybe I&#x27;m not that great and my gender/race really <i>was</i> a major factor in my hiring decision. Talk about imposter syndrome.<p>Also, just on a more general ethical note: People in certain groups have indeed been treated very unfairly for centuries, but flipping the table feels kind of &quot;eye for an eye&quot;.<p>Of course unconscious biases are a major problem and will probably be impossible to get rid of or ignore during a hiring process, but I think blind hiring procedures (no name, gender, age, etc. listed on resume or during the first stages of initial online interviews) are an all around better option. I think if organizations work hard enough, they can eliminate a lot of these issues in the pipeline.

10758652,comment,10758296,10758296,0,0,hodwik,,,"Read this critique on Reddit this morning. Thought it was interesting.<p>Sharing here:<p>&quot;Ah, this misleading derivatives stuff again...\nIn two steps:\nFirstly, I&#x27;ll use as an example something called an interest rate swap. If you have a loan with floating rate interest payments, then this lets you change that to a fixed interest rate of say 4%. As follows:<p>The lender requires you to pay floating rate interest. The swap is an agreement with a third party derivatives guy that you should receive a floating rate from him and pay fixed to him. So every month you will receive whatever the floating rate is from the derivatives guy, and pay a fixed rate to him - and the floating you receive pass on to the guy charging interest on the loan.\nFor example: the loan has a floating rate payment which at the moment is 4%, and you agree with the derivatives guy that you should pay him a fixed rate of 4% and will receive whatever the floating rate is. If the floating rate rises to 8%, then you pay the derivatives guy 4% and receive 8% and pass those 8% on to the lender. If the floating rate falls to 2%, you pay the derivatives guy 4% and receive 2% and pass those on to the lender.<p>But 4% of what? For the calculation to work, you need a monetary amount to calculate 4% of. That is the notional. You receive cash of the floating rate * the notional, and pay cash 4% * the notional. You need some way to translate the percent into actual cash payments and that happens through the notional.<p>If your loan is 10m, then the notional amount you want is probably 10m. If you only want half fixed half floating, then you can set the notional amount to 5m.\nBut the notional amount is just the basis used for calculation. It&#x27;s not &quot;money&quot;. It&#x27;s a figure plugged into a formula. The notional isn&#x27;t put into the bank and can&#x27;t be withdrawn from it, and at the end of the period of interest payments the notional isn&#x27;t there anymore because its only purpose was to calculate those interest payments.<p>If someone wanted to they could break that entire counting system by simply making a swap with a notional of 1 centillion dollars and deciding the payment isi equal to 5% * notional / 1 centillion. If you wanted to swap 100m USD you would need 100m of these contracts for a notional of 100 million centillion dollars. The actual money changing hands is nowhere near the notional.<p>Secondly:\nSometimes people use derivatives for speculation. What they can do is enter a contract and then after prices change they enter the opposite contract.\nFor example: contracts for oil 6 months from now are $50 per barrel. Someone buys contracts for 50 million barrels. Then the price changes to $60 per barrel. He then sells contracts for 50 million barrels.<p>The only practical effect of this trade is that he receives a cash sum today. In 6 months nothing happens - they are automatically matched and offset.\nIn this case the notional amount would be the price of 50 million barrels of oil times 2.<p>Now, it&#x27;s possible to do this at high speed. So rather than wait until the next day, he enters a contract and then the opposite seconds or milliseconds from each other. As long as the buying and the selling is for the same amount, this could make for an arbitrarily high notional.<p>There are absolutely risks in derivatives. For example, what happens if one party loses enough money to go bankrupt and all the bonds they placed as security for that event isn&#x27;t enough to cover the loss. But the notional amount is not a good place to start to understand risks. Like, every type of derivative will have its own rules for how the notional translates into actual cash - e.g. for an oil contract it would be the full value of the oil, and for an interest rape swap it would just be the amount that&#x27;s multiplied by the percentage.<p>Not someone who works with this daily, but covered it quite well in studies.&quot;",1450449631

You might still want to think abstractly in terms of a network boundary, but you absolutely do not necessarily need one point where it&#x27;s all implemented. Depending on the architecture and your needs, you could also, for example, have an instance of the same packet filter on each machine.<p>I am not saying that there is no place for that kind of architecture, but the current state of affairs with IPv4 severely limits the options as to how to implement what you actually need. In a way, even the concept of &quot;a private network&quot; is a bad idea. Sure, you may want to limit access to some services for some clients and such--but really, the mere distinction of &quot;inside&quot; vs &quot;outside&quot; causes many problems in today&#x27;s network operations. What if you interconnect you &quot;internal network&quot; with some other &quot;internal network&quot; because someone &quot;external&quot; to you needs to access some service that&#x27;s &quot;internal&quot; to you?

The only way the economic transaction of education makes sense to me is to acknowledge the potential of passive learning (books, internet), but to recognize the desire to speed the process. While I can pick up a book on abstract algebra and work through the problems myself to gain understanding, I know that I can pay someone who already is an expert in abstract algebra to package up the mental abstractions for me. Its like using compression for webpages. You could transmit everything uncompressed and the web would work just fine. However we want to save time and money so we compress, delivering content faster and using less bandwidth. The only justification I can see for teachers to exist in a free market is that they speed the process of knowledge aquisition.<p>Now I support fee schedules based on how much work the teacher has to do the shove the knowledge into the head. If it will cost $X for a fast student, I don&#x27;t have any problem with the market pricing that same knowledge to a slow student at $X,XXX. Teachers should be compensated for their expertise. However setting the market price is up to the participant, and a contract to deliver the good should be binding.

10758551,comment,10751269,10758487,0,0,seiji,,,"ZFS supports (and excels at) two necessary things for a good file system: copy on write snapshots and filesystem serialization.  ZFS is designed to run one filesystem <i>per user</i>, so ZFS is designed to scale crazy high with little management overhead.  It also makes it easy for snapshots to equal isolated per-user or even per-appication backups.<p>You can do neat things like: create a base filesystem, create a snapshot of it (i.e. &quot;freeze&quot; the filesystem in time), send the snapshot to another system (or over the network for S3 storage, etc), continue modifying files, create another snapshot on top of your first one, now you can send/backup the new snapshot which is only a <i>diff</i> of the original snapshot.<p>Many other systems besides ZFS support snapshots/copy-on-write layers, <i>but</i> they are mostly hacks and your performance will drop considerably during the &quot;snapshot existing&quot; time.  ZFS is different because the snapshot mechanism doesn&#x27;t kill your performance (unlike the 18 layer Linux file system organization).<p>&quot;Sending&quot; a snapshot can either be directly over the network to another system to ingest the snapshot (enabling you to stream a new filesystem/snapshot into existence on a remote machine), or you can gzip the snapshot stream and send it off to backup storage.<p>You can layer your snapshot diffs as much as you like.  As long as you have all the diffs back to the original file system, you can re-create any point-in-time snapshot layer from your backup archive.<p>Longer details with examples are all over, but a good overview point is: <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18752_01/html/819-5461/gbchx.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18752_01/html/819-5461/gbchx.htm...</a><p>Also, it&#x27;s basically the only <i>sane</i> way to run containers in production since all the copy-on-write and snapshot sending isn&#x27;t an 8 layer deep hack cake.  In Solaris, containers are aware of filesystems at the deepest levels and the <i>networking</i> is aware of containers too.

At UK universities most such staff take the job for research and have to teach as a condition of that job.<p>It&#x27;s true that university staff vary in their commitment to teaching and I can remember many who felt that teaching was beneath them and a distraction from what they actually want to do.

10758432,comment,10758085,10758085,0,0,balabaster,,,"I can see both sides of this argument. On one hand, when you pay £9,000 for an education, you expect to get exactly that - an education, not someone pointing you towards a bunch of information that you could have found yourself with half a dozen Google searches and the wherewithal to do dig through yourself... for free. It brings to mind a quote from Good Will Hunting: &quot;you dropped 150 grand on a fuckin&#x27; education you could have got for a dollar fifty in late charges at the public library!&quot; So I completely understand the mentality that when I pay you £9,000 for an education, I expect you to actively participate in educating me - doubly so when every student in that classroom is paying equally.<p>On the other hand, I disagree with the sentiment that students feel like they are buying a degree. At least from my perspective, the degree itself is largely meaningless. It&#x27;s the education piece I&#x27;m after. I am buying education via access to a pre-vetted, qualified and educated mentor that I can go to with all questions I have regarding my understandings and misunderstandings. I can do the learning piece myself, but I can&#x27;t ask YouTube and online course material questions if I don&#x27;t understand it, or to clarify my understanding of it... and I expect that as long as I meet my obligation to work hard to understand the material you are presenting me with and submit the coursework required for the course, I <i>am</i> indirectly buying that degree - and that withstanding, I <i>expect</i> to get the degree that I not only shed blood, sweat and tears for, but also paid £9,000 for.<p>As a person, I also demand respect, not because I think the world owes me that, certainly not because I feel like I&#x27;m naturally entitled to it, but because I understand just as you do that we all have lives outside of the situation in which we interface. Sometimes those lives get in the way of our best intentions, some days trying to juggle those lives and get to work on time is all but impossible, and just as we are expected to afford respect to those around us, I expect the same affordance, no more, no less. So if my circumstances have prevented me from handing an assignment in on time, I expect some consideration for those circumstances, just as I am expected to afford the professor consideration for not attending class today because their real life prevented them from doing that, and you know what, given that I paid £9,000 to be in that classroom, I <i>do</i> feel like some respect should be given to that.<p>As a lifelong student, watching the exponential increase in tuition fees and the attitudes of students towards educational systems <i>and vice versa</i>, I find it hard to blame the student. The education system is broken, tuition fees keep going up, the quality of education remains mediocre at best, through no fault of the professors who work hard and get pittance compared to what the university makes off the students. The media constantly bangs the drum of entitlement and consumerism into everyone from an early age; and the media is really just a product of the society that we began building in the 1950&#x27;s...

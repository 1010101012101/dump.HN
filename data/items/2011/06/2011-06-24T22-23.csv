Lots more powerful than a generic suggestion. Think ""You've been to Aquagrill a lot, maybe you'd also like Lure Fishbar down the street cause it's pretty similar."" LOTS of work to be done on explore for those with a background in search quality, machine learning, statistics, or infrastructure.<p>specials 2.0 = much more flexible than a one sized fits all groupon. Venue owners can create specials around frequency of visits, checking in with a bunch of other folks (friends or non friends), being the mayor, and many other criterion. We're also, as you may have seen with our recent AmEx announcement trying to integrate our merchant tools with 3rd parties to provide value to both users and merchants on the foursquare platform.<p>We've got lots more coming down the pipe as well.<p>""We copy no one"" might be a bit overstated[1] but it really is how we try to think about things. Not everything we do is revolutionary, a lot is evolutionary as well. That's just the nature of building a real product. It can't <i>all</i> be mind blowing (but we try!).<p>Even if we don't succeed 100% of the time at making things totally new and awesome, I think having that as a conscious goal is a good trait to have in a company.<p>-harryh<p>1.

2694259,comment,2693599,2693599,55,0,ChuckMcM,,,"First, there isn't enough information to know what it is this person has (or has not) done.<p>Secondly, the fifth amendment of the US Constitution allows you to refuse to provide <i>testimony</i> which you feel may incriminate you. Generally encryption pass phrases do not count as testimony, the legal system treats them as keys. And that would be covered under the fourth amendment which says the government cannot compel to you to give access to your property for search unless they have probable cause.<p>If they <i>do</i> have probable cause, they get a <i>warrant</i> which gives them the power to do the search temporarily and only for what they think exists. So if you get a warrant to search your hard drive for something, you are compelled to give them the password just like you are compelled to let them into your house if they have a warrant to search for something like drugs or guns or counterfeit plush toys.<p>However sometimes the courts do see it as a fifth amendment issue [1] and that has been under debate for a while. (As far as I can tell the legal theory is similar to the police not being able to compel you to tell them where you left the body in a capital crime.)<p>Disclaimer I am not a lawyer this isn't legal advice, and I've not followed up the cited case to see if it made it to the supreme court or not. Any circuit level decision would not be binding on different circuits.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-9854034-38.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-9854034-38.html</a><p>Follow up on the Boucher case:

2694204,comment,2694179,2694179,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This article discusses a recent decision to allow Apple to also bid on the Nortel patents. For those of you who aren't following this skirmish in Patent-a-geddon, what is at stake here are some key patents for implementing 4G radios and phones.<p>Google has an opening bid of $900M on the table. This will go up. I expect Google to pay between 6 and 8 billion dollars for the patents.<p>The strategy here is pretty clear, if you have patents which you can use against Apple in the phone business, then it mitigates, or even completely neuters Apple's ability to come after you with their own patents. Basically the table will be 'license us everything you patented about smartphones or we won't license you the ability to play in the 4G market'.<p>Apple on the other hand if they get these patents has an even stronger hand and can keep non-Apple smartphones price incompetitive for years and years.<p>The number 6B comes from it being 10% of Apple's 60B in short term cash and cash equivalents [1]. If they were to pay more than that in cash they would have to put it up for a shareholder vote and it might get out of hand, Google on the other hand pretty much has to own these patents. So Apple bids 6 and Google bids > 6 to force the issue.<p>Amazing that in 'life' Nortel was never worth so much :-)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2011/01/18/apple-reports-record-1q-2011-6-billion-profit-on-26-74-billion-in-revenue/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macrumors.com/2011/01/18/apple-reports-record-1q-...</a>",1308954759

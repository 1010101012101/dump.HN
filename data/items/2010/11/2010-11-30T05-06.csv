I haven't seen great success, or really great failure.  The thing is, every time I tried to be less than honest to gain an advantage?  I got slapped down.  Sometimes hard.  (though most of my forays were probing and weak, and so were the consequences.)<p>My suspicion is that lying and dishonesty is a skill like any other, and one that is not trivial to learn.  You can't just lie and expect to be rewarded, you need to know when and how to lie.   People spend their lives studying that sort of thing, as well as how to detect liars.  Personally, I think the average businessperson is better off being as honest and transparent as he or she is able while focusing on some other competitive advantage.

They are trying to make social something open, in other words they are trying to pull an android on facebook by making it irrelevant or at least not as needed as all websites will get the same features. You will be able to communicate with/share photos with/follow your wordpress friends from blogger.com or diaspora or status.net or buzz. Only time will tell if it will be as successful as Android.<p>I think this is a good strategy, google can't beat facebook at their own game by creating a facebook clone just like they could not have beaten the iphone with their own phone. Making all of facebook features an open/easy/distributed/federated stack and attacking facebook with the help of the rest of the web seems like a much better strategy.",1291096233

Or should we just organically grow the network and expand with fibre in new areas and spend the money where it is needed.<p>I for one are scared about the abuse and waste that will happen with a public project of this size and the one-size-fits-all mentality that goes with it.  The monopoly will be protected by law to make it pay, and that's a bad thing for all involved.

How about this...let me take multiple photos while filling the box, integrate it with your website, then later I can inventory items I want to by viewing the pictures for each box.  Or if not, i can quickly skim through boxes and just look at the pics if i'm looking for something.<p>Typing on a regular keyboard is a must. Website integration is a must.  I'd use an online app like that for lots of things, especially if it bad a nice iPhone app.  I've been unable to find my travel router twice in the last 6 months, even though I swore I wouldn't forget where I put it each time!!<p>How long until RFID tags are cheap enough that we can just attach one to every new thing we purchase?",1291094327

And it doesn't matter how hard they try, because Google will build their social network in typical Google style -- a big, monolithic, overarching, ugly, centralized, database intricately geared for maximum advertising revenue.  And that is precisely why Google will fail.  At this point, a true Facebook threat would need to be something quite radically innovative that Google would never have even thought of it because they're focused on advertising dollars.",1291094133

1953149,comment,1952730,1953096,0,0,jacques_chester,,,"> The unusual aspect of Australia's voting system causing such bad policy is compulsory voting, rather than proportional representation.<p>I disagree. Compulsory voting is a net benefit, because it drives the parties to focus on the median voter (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotellings_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotellings_law</a>).<p>In voluntary systems, only <i>motivated</i> electors will turn out. How do you motivate people to vote? Not with discussion, but with emotion.<p>Consider: US politics is marked by a startling mix of soaring rhetoric and ruthless negativity. Why? Because the goal is to get your own voters to turn out and to make the other guy's voters say ""We give up, they all suck!""<p>Australian politics might be a bit country-bumpkin in its tone and content, but it tends to focus on boring service-delivery issues rather than Grand Visions. Reform in stages is the general paradigm of Australian politics -- you have to carry that median voter with you.<p>We do have the key advantage that bills to do with appropriation must deal only with appropriation (s 54). This makes it much harder for horse-trading to occur. Likewise, Australian-style party discipline is the strongest in the world and pretty much precludes sideline deal-making (for good and ill).<p>As Murray Rothbard observed, minor technical details of process can have surprising practical consequences.",1291093469

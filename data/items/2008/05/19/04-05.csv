But I guess it worked, I read the article anyway. He makes a rather roundabout way of dissing groupthink, but hey, its his blog.",1211172994

193856,comment,193559,193559,0,0,DmitriLebedev,,,"The article starts with ""I hate wasting time passively watching that TV stuff"", then makes a weak point admitting that wasting time on editing or reading Wikipedia is useful. Then it ends pointing in the opposite direction: ""But let professionals do their job and let's just consume what there's on the market"".",1211172310

193846,comment,193619,193619,0,0,DmitriLebedev,,,"Good social development statistics doesn't mean the people are happy with their lives. As I see, the article takes the results for granted without any doubt and then speculates and searches for the reasons. I'd at least search for the polls that ask if the people are optimistic/pessimistic, consider themselves happy/unhappy.<p>Though, I believe, standing far from the noisy Europe, maybe far from the consumption rush, they may feel calm, happy and optimistic. That's great.<p>> ""The study was lent some credibility by the finding that the Russians were the most unhappy.""<p>Yes, if you assume the myth that life in Russia very unpleasant, the study gets credibility. On the other hand, in the year the study was made, other studies showed Russian population to be the most optimistic in the history, thanks to fast economic growth and, I think, to breaking the pessimistic soviet mentality.",1211170571

He has a few things wrong with him, but several are almost certainly tied to chemicals he used at work.  This was the reason I posted the 'corporations can be evil' post.  It is why I feel strongly that we need to improve the current system to include some social and environmental costs of certain corporations.<p>I do understand that will not happen soon, and we are forced to work within the rules of the current system.",1211169792

Those who successfully time the market are more a part of the market mechanism rather than the customers/end users of the market.<p>The only real purpose of financial markets is risk management. Any human society (and non-human societies also) has to risk some capital to gain more capital/value. The purpose of stocks and financial markets in general is to diversify the risk, while still funding oportunities and it&#x27;s the only proven mechanism by which a large portion of the population can participate in this wealth creation.<p>The value of risk management is hard to fathom. But if you are a programmer, you might want to try and simulate &quot;gambler&#x27;s ruin&quot; and see what happens with high risk or low risk strategies.

Each commit should compile (...generally. With exceptions). Commits that fix spelling, or change some spacing issues end up cluttering the history and making it hard to see what&#x27;s being actually done. When someone looks over your code they should see things like:<p>commit1: he/she added some methods<p>commit2: refactored some code<p>commit3: he/she plugged in the methods created into the refactored code<p>etc.<p>The branch as a whole should be a finished feature. Keep the features small-ish. Try not to have a branch that living on it&#x27;s own for a long time. You can merge the master branch into it, however you&#x27;ll slowly be out of sync with your team b/c they don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re up to.<p>The only thing I absolutely detest in Git, is that is no quick method to change history on local changes. Say I add a method and make a commit - then I do a bunch of other work and 10 commits later I realize that the method I had written needed to be const. Instead of be able to edit that commit and add the const labels, I end up having to make another commit that no one cares about and no one really should have to look at. It just makes the history incredibly cluttered and make it a lot harder to find the commits I&#x27;m interested in.<p>The workaround is to make a new branch and cherry pick changes - but it&#x27;s a huge PITA and easy to mess up<p>Aside:<p>Does anyone know what diff tool is best for working in C++?

7853878,comment,7852717,7852717,14,0,kiyoto,,,"I want to shed some light on this topic. As a former HFT quant, I find the general &quot;Main Street&quot; sentiment toward the profession to be misguided.<p>1. HFT does NOT take anything from most investors most of the time. Most investors trade on a much longer investment horizon than any HFT firm. If you are a normal investor, you can lump up most of HFTs into the same bucket as the exchange itself. Most of them engage in some combinations of (i) pure arbitrage (ii) very short-termed statistical arbitrage (iii) market-making based on (i) and (ii). None of this is really that relevant to most investors. The only time HFTs can screw over a lot of investors is when their software goes awry. But this is a risk that any computerized system has, high frequency or not. If there is a major bug in Chicago Mercantile Exchange&#x27;s matching engines, that would be a total disaster.<p>2. HFT firms do have huge execution risks: if you are making a two-sided market, there is a chance you can get &quot;swept&quot;, meaning when the value of the underlying moves faster than you can react, you get filled on one side of the order without a realistic chance of hedging for a profit. HFT firms do a ton of research into estimating their execution risks. (edit: This point is often glossed over, making HFTs look like this evil superpower group of nerds exploiting other investors. That&#x27;s not the case)<p>3. Finally, most HFT traders don&#x27;t go into the profession solely for the money, just like most people do not apply for YC solely for their passion. Most of my former coworkers weren&#x27;t that greedy and led pretty modest lives despite making hundreds of thousands of dollars. For them, high frequency trading had a locally optimal balance of tackling intellectually challenging problems while getting paid handsomely.<p>I won&#x27;t say HFT is the most valuable thing that its practitioners can be doing. I think the (trading) world would operate just fine without all these micro-second level transactions. But they are NOT the next subprime mortgage, and I just hope folks stop commenting on stuff they have no clue about.",1401997464

So let&#x27;s say that someone does want to trade 50 shares, in your example, and breaks up their order into 2 25-share orders.  At the point at which a 25-share order is executed on the market, the sheer size of the trade is not very much.  It&#x27;s not likely to signify a market move.  At that time, nobody has knowledge that there is a second 25-share order heading to the second market.

7853846,comment,7852717,7853775,9,0,tptacek,,,"I wrote this a few months ago, trying to explain market makers; I lightly edited it to make it make sense on this thread.<p>At any given point in time, the &quot;true&quot; (buy-side) investors are likely to be relatively far apart on prices. This is especially true in thinly-traded markets. For example: consider housing, which is the canonical example of an illiquid market.<p>I know the value of my house (it&#x27;s around $300k). Say I want to sell it. The more liquidity I need, the worse price I&#x27;m going to get. Anyone with any intuition for the housing market knows that if I have to sell my house tomorrow, I am going to get a god-awful price for it; the &quot;tomorrow&quot; price for my house is many tens of thousands of dollars off its true value.<p>This creates huge problems for homeowners. The obvious standard advice for sellers is to wait patiently for the best price, counting on many weeks or months before a reasonable offer arrives. But I have to pay money every month I hold on to the house. If I need to move immediately, for instance for a job, or because my financial circumstances have changed, I might need the house to sell quickly, and because houses are illiquid I have to accept a crappy price. Or consider trends in the market: by forcing me to hold the house for months rather than days, I&#x27;m maximally exposed to swings in the market. So if Chicago housing prices crater while I&#x27;m trying to sell, the extra time it takes to unload the house takes that price swing out of my hide.<p>(You can easily see how the same thing happens in reverse in &quot;hot&quot; markets like Palo Alto, with the buyer now assuming the role of the hapless Chicago seller).<p>The exact same thing happens in the public markets; it&#x27;s just not as intuitively obvious because we&#x27;re working in smaller deltas of time and price.<p>But the public markets have a huge advantage that the real estate market doesn&#x27;t: market makers.<p>Imagine if houses traded (were bought and sold) so frequently that a smart company could make good educated guesses about the current value of any given house. Imagine if that company would on any given day snap up a house offered for sale. That company wouldn&#x27;t pay my asking price for my Chicago house, but it would pay something much closer to it than the &quot;true&quot; market would. After buying my house, the company would immediately offer my house for sale at any price greater than what it bought the house for. I wouldn&#x27;t care, though: either I&#x27;d be thrilled for the opportunity to sell my house quickly and painlessly, or I just wouldn&#x27;t accept their offer and instead do what I do now, which is to wait for the best offer.<p>Assuming the housing market makers were smart, the money they&#x27;d get by forcing me to accept a lower bid would be &quot;free money&quot; they get simply by being smart about valuing houses and having capital available to deploy. We&#x27;d all be a little irritated at them for scalping distressed buyers and sellers. But something else will inevitably happen: other smart firms will smell the free money, and they will compete for it. To capture a share of the premiums, all they have to do is offer a slightly more favorable price, so that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll do. Over time, the money the housing market makers will get less and less &quot;free&quot;, and the price penalty for immediate liquidity will get lower and lower.<p>In my fantasy real estate market, I now have the opportunity to avail myself of a reasonable &quot;market&quot; order, or to buy or sell on a &quot;limit&quot; price. I could do that if there were housing market makers, but in their absence I can&#x27;t, because the price hit for selling tomorrow is too great; it might be a 25% discount on my asking price, or even something close to 50%. That&#x27;s the cost of illiquidity, or, stated more directly, the value of liquidity.<p>It&#x27;s probably also worth saying that liquidity is a presumption of the public electronic markets. Because it&#x27;s taken for granted, there are whole trading strategies (hedging, for instance) that depend on its presence. These trading strategies face execution risk: if they can&#x27;t bail out of a position within a specific window of time, they incur losses for the trader.",1401997224

The Soviet spies who got information on American nuclear weapons development programs were clearly guilty of espionage; note that this is true even if they didn&#x27;t actually manage to get the information to their Soviet case handlers.<p>But if they leaked those same nuclear weapons programs to the American public (and by extension, the <i>world</i> public) <i>in addition to</i> their Soviet case handlers they&#x27;d still be guilty of espionage.<p>Snowden is the Manning case all over again. You can make an argument for whistleblowing for information he revealed showing crimes committed against the American people. For literally all other information (stuff that doesn&#x27;t reveal crimes, stuff that reveals the NSA doing its literally assigned security mission, etc.) it&#x27;s illegal espionage, whether the American public happened to be CC&#x27;ed or not.",1401996890

Mostly as a dark joke. But the expectation in some circles was that the NSA was listening to pretty much everything.<p>But that does not mean <i>most people</i> believe this, or had even heard about it.<p>People are blind to it.<p>I remember discussing CIA with friends at school, and they refused to accept that CIA had carried out operations that the CIA have publicly acknowledged either directly, or indirectly (by declassifying documents, or by allowing past directors to talk about them to interviewers) because they didn&#x27;t fit with the image they had of the US. The same blindness has existed regarding the NSA.<p>Even now, we see people who doubt every word that comes out from the Snowden documents, yet who blindly accepts responses from government.  One of my &quot;favorite&quot; examples is how Norwegian media blindly accepts that the past revelations that Norway provides the NSA with vast metadata about calls in Afghanistan via our military intelligence must be the real explanation - despite these numbers appearing in files that for <i>all other countries shown</i> relate to domestic surveillance. Furthermore, Norwegian media has not re-visited  this strange situation, that also made the otherwise very silent military security service reveal supposed operational details, while the domestic Police Sercurity Service just issued a short denial and kept silent afterwards. They have kept ignoring this despite the recent revelation that the NSA is recording <i>every call</i>, not just metadata, in Afghanistan.<p>The supposedly very valuable tens of millions of call records that Norway supposedly supplies the NSA with from Afghanistan suddenly seems rather pointless if the NSA has so complete surveillance that they can record the actual contents. The facts don&#x27;t fit the explanations, yet no questions are raised.<p>The people who do not question are the ones that get shocked and outraged whenever something manages to sneak past their filter.<p>And there are a <i>lot</i> of them.

HFT does a better job than they did at providing liquidity, for a lower premium.  However it does a worse job at providing price stability.<p>Furthermore to me HFT looks like stealing because it is very inefficient relative to the need.  If exchanges were to reorganize how they work slightly, we would get much better price stability, somewhat less liquidity, and have a much lower premium.<p>The necessary change is simply this.  Exchanges would have to set a price at which orders are to execute.  Whenever there are excess orders in one direction or the other, that price would drift up or down, slowly, until the order executes.  The result is that trades might take a minute to execute, but margins would be far less.  Sure, a ton of finance people would jump up and down screaming bloody murder about how many of their complex trades would be affected.

Needing milk so desperately that you can&#x27;t wait until the grocery store opens in the morning is supposed to be an unusual condition, not the normal way of doing business.<p>But more importantly, HFT is not the same as liquidity. HFT only works in the first place because there are <i>already</i> market orders being placed; if no one but HFTs wanted to buy or sell stocks, no trades would take place.

Let&#x27;s think about a simple market, where the price of a good can go from 1 to 10 dollars. One person is looking to sell the good for $8, while another person is looking to buy at $2. The market currently has a bid-offer spread of $6. With only two participants in this market place, they will have to meet somewhere in the middle, or never trade. The seller will lose value because he has to sell at a lower price, while the buyer will lose money by paying more. However, if there were more participants in the market place, all with different ideas about how valuable the good is, the buyer is more likely to get their $2 price while the seller is more likely to get their $8 price. For example, if a new seller joins the market at a price of $6, the person looking to buy can now do so at a cheaper price.<p>Basically, with more participants, the bid-offer spread will begin to close, and trading will occur at more prices.",1401995165

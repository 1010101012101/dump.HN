You can access this data from any other computer, and a mobile device. It works on Windows, Linux and Android right now. We'll support OS X and the iOS in the next couple of months, too.<p>The main focus of the product is privacy and control of your data. Since everything is with you, on your computers, it's completely private and you remain in total control of it. The other major benefit is that you can get (almost) unlimited storage. We don't put any restrictions; use as much space as your computer has, and, in fact, you can add external hard drives if you need to store and sync more.<p>Other than this, you get all that you get with a traditional public cloud. You have access to your files anywhere, anytime. It works on devices you have installed it on, and even on devices you haven't (you'd have to use the Internet to access your files). There are some other interesting things we're doing including de-duplication which allows you to store more data, the best search that a cloud service has (search within the documents, etc.) and a lot of other things.<p>I'd love to have you take a look at it, and share your feedback. We are in private beta (and shooting for a January 2013 launch), and we would love to hear any suggestions/questions you might have.<p>You can find more here: http://www.parablu.com/features<p>Thanks for your time!",1353610744

4819676,comment,4819325,4819650,1,0,danso,,,"I posted the OP but I agree with you...I think the author is jumping to unsupported conclusions. However, I've never really thought about the time saved from washing clothes. In raw amounts of time, it probably has done more (so far) to change society, since individuals at every geographical level need to wash clothes (outside nudist colonies)...whereas it's possible to have a thriving local business/enterprise that does not have an Internet presence...for the time being.<p>* Also, I think the Internet's benefits are harder to quantify. Everyone can think about how much time and energy they'd spend washing clothes; it's much harder to visualize what you'd be doing without the Internet. For example, the Internet has exposed me to a lot of educational material and distribution channels that has allowed me to explore new career and personal opportunities. It did not necessarily <i>save me time</i> because I may have gone down another thought process entirely without the insights gained.<p>(and of course, this phenomenon affects those in the information sector disproportionately...just as the washing machine wouldn't affect the change in lifestyle for the upper-class, who may just have to pay more for clotheswashing but may not have a drastic change in lifestyle)",1353610515

This way your friend will not feel in a too awkward situation, and you'll be able to give him his money back. Ask for a 4-month deadline payment, and offer interest (let's say 60 dollars?). If he's a friend, he'll help.
If your friend is able/willing to give you only 1k, accept it. And find another friend who will lend the other 1k. It's doable, and there's nothing to be ashamed of.

4819549,comment,4818674,4819486,14,0,nostrademons,,,"The point of discounts, coupons, etc. isn't to get you to buy, it's to build very comprehensive data on the demand elasticity curves of each good they sell.<p>If you've taken an introductory microeconomics course, you'll remember that almost all the models of a ""rational"" firm involve maximizing profit by picking a price point where people still buy yet will pay a maximum price per unit.  How firms determine that demand curve is left as an exercise - it's assumed that firms who get it right will survive while firms that don't will go out of business, leaving only firms who get it right.  This is cold comfort if you're a business owner and want <i>your</i> firm to get it right.<p>So what do the big retailers do?  They A/B test.  They divide customers into two groups (say, those who have a Safeway card and those who don't) and offer a different price to each.  Then they measure how much of each good people will buy at each price, and presumably do some statistical corrections for demographics, the ""sale"" effect (where people buy whatever's on sale regardless of price), folks who won't use coupons no matter how cheap, etc.  They end the sale, and then pick a different price next month.  Over time, they build up extensive data about just how high they can raise their prices before people stop buying entirely.<p>So when you ignore the discount, that's Mission Fucking Accomplished for the store.  It's telling them that the discount doesn't matter, and you'll buy regardless, and so they should try raising the price instead.  They don't care about the <i>sale</i>, they care about the <i>data</i>, so that they can make more money from all their other customers.",1353608055

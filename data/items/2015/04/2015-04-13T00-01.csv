Over an extended time frame this will probably cause me to become overweight and deficient in vitamins.

The way to make dramatically more than that is to be compensated as part of the revenue stream of a business in some way, and then to increase the amount of revenue that is funneled into that business.<p>Owning your own business is the simplest example of this but other options are available.

9365380,comment,9365252,9365252,0,0,saulrh,,,"Aligns reasonably well with my (short) experience. I got a bag from a friend and ate a jar of Soylent every morning for breakfast for about a week. It was in fact pretty great: I&#x27;d pour out N calories, where N was how much I figured I&#x27;d need to eat to get to $nextmeal, and then I&#x27;d drink it and be on my way. The stuff has really nice properties as far as hunger goes, too; it has neither the lead-brick problem that I get from things like chicken and dumplings nor the gone-in-fifteen-minutes problem that I have with fried rice. I generally ate as much as I wanted and felt perfectly full until right when I&#x27;d expected to be having lunch or dinner.<p>To answer the people who think it can&#x27;t possibly be healthy, honestly, I don&#x27;t have time to fix most of my diet. I can put in all the time I want to make sure my dinners are perfect, and I generally do, but I&#x27;m too rushed in the morning to have anything other than cereal. And I have to have lunch out so that&#x27;s impossible to get right. Even if Soylent doesn&#x27;t have &quot;the proper carb-fat ratio&quot; or something, it&#x27;s better than what I have right now.<p>So, summary, I have some on order and the rest of you can say &quot;I told you so&quot; if I get cancer in thirty years. Given what some other people survive on I doubt you&#x27;ll get the opportunity.",1428886490
9365379,comment,9365252,9365252,0,0,jdkuepper,,,"Thanks for the post-<p>It would be interesting to see some more detailed N=1 studies posted regarding Soylent. In particular, I&#x27;d be very interested in seeing a blood lipid profile, blood pressure readings, and blood glucose readings before and after to see its effects on key markers for metabolic syndrome.<p>I&#x27;m not opposed to the idea of engineered food (it would certainly be convenient), but I&#x27;m not convinced that the same macronutrient profile is ideal for everyone. My other big concern is that there&#x27;s potential harm in the lack of diversity - e.g. &quot;unknown unknowns&quot; so to speak.<p>Unfortunately, the field of nutrition is not very WELL studied despite the high NUMBER of studies published, so I won&#x27;t pretend that I have a better answer than Soylent to the problem with nutrition in society. It&#x27;s good to see that people are at least working on the problem in creative ways, so long as they aren&#x27;t harming anyone.",1428886487

Thus, I could see a reasonable salary of $150k at the Senior (10-12 year level.) Obviously, there are specialties where you could do much better.<p>That&#x27;s a high salary at 24, so you will either grow significantly, or you&#x27;ll see that level out quickly.",1428886486
9365377,comment,9365123,9365123,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I have very limited knowledge of this situation, but, I&#x27;m gonna pile on anyway:<p>With that kind of money raised, the founders didn&#x27;t get &quot;nothing&quot;. They got a salary, probably a decent one, for however long they were running the thing. Which is more than many startup founders get out of businesses that fail. If they don&#x27;t have personal debt, or didn&#x27;t lose relationships or friendships, they came out ahead of many startup founders who started a business that failed.<p>They raised more money than the business was worth. I don&#x27;t blame them for doing so; many people have done it, and no amount of seeing other people make that mistake will necessarily prepare a founder to turn down several million dollars of extra runway to try for the big exit. But, it sounds like there is simply less money on the table than there are people wanting that money (and that have contractual rights to it).<p>Given the interests of GetSatisfaction were always misaligned with the interests of their customers (i.e. the business model was effectively a shakedown, in the same vein as Yelp), it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that eventually their dreams didn&#x27;t align with the reality of how many people wanted to pay for it. No matter how good the product is, if you have to extort people to buy it, you&#x27;re not building a sustainable business.<p>I&#x27;m all for ranting about VCs being assholes, because sometimes they are. But, as far as I can tell, that&#x27;s not the case here. Founders made some bad calls, probably some other people did, too. The business failed. It happens. If I were them, I&#x27;d take this as a valuable lesson...and probably wouldn&#x27;t burn bridges with the people who invested in me in the past, because history indicates they&#x27;ll be the same people to invest in me in the future (a failed business is not a death sentence in the valley, and many investors have invested in the same team for multiple businesses).",1428886482

It&#x27;s a competition within the community to see who has the more accomplished offspring - I see it every time my parents gather with friends or family - it&#x27;s sad but it&#x27;s all they know to do.<p>Anecdotal perspectives:
So I grew up poor, but I would say I am quite successful now by most standards - yet I still feel the pressure to achieve much more than I currently have (just from wanting to be the best I can be, but also I feel indebted to my parents and want to give them the world). They never pressured me to be a $high_status_title, but I felt to pressure to be someone that could support them into their old age since I saw how hard they worked to provide for me. In a sense, I understood the world of my parents and because of that, I created pressure for myself to achieve greater success (by their standards).<p>I had a friend in HS, who was extremely smart, and both his parents were doctors, living in a wealthy neighborhood, etc. I constantly saw how much pressure his parents were creating for him, PSAT prep and SAT prep and all that, which I felt he didn&#x27;t need. Whenever we weren&#x27;t playing CS, he would be studying to make sure he got into the right colleges, then the right medical schools, though I never really asked him if that&#x27;s what he wanted out of life. I felt bad for him because I did fine in HS and felt fine just coasting (I didn&#x27;t begin trying as hard as I should have till junior year of college, but in the end I think I did okay with much luck involved, of course).

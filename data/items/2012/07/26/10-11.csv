4295355,comment,4294911,4295316,5,0,kokey,,,"I think it's highly dependent on the type of person, or family.  For example I have had to help many people track down their documents which are somewhere in a download or documents folder.  I, personally, am not the kind of person who sorts my paperwork into folders.  Neither, like some people, do I organise every single e-mail into a folder.  Gmail has understood this well, and makes it easier to find what I want.  I find it much easier to make sure I know _when_ something happened, I make sure I e-mail myself notes, and copies of documents, but most of the time it happens by itself anyway, so I can search for them in Gmail.  For example if I want to find some paperwork done when we moved into a new house, I can track down the date in Gmail, and know in which box to go dig it up.  Most of the time what I need has an e-mail record somewhere.<p>That said, I strongly support allowing people to approach the problem from both sides, chronological with good tagging/searching or being able to organise things into folders in a way they like.  People work in different ways.  However, I think the default is to be disorganised, and the best way to deal with being disorganised is to keep it as simple as possible.",1343299843

4295342,comment,4294911,4294911,1,0,rnadna,,,"I wonder if others have scaled back on the ""meaningfulness"" of file names.  I name a lot of my files (and directories) 01, 02, 03, etc (with suffixes according to meaning) and then I have a local README file that lists the contents of each of these.<p>I find it this scheme handy for scientific work in which the files are often multiple attempts to solve a problem.  It saves me from writing file names like ""solution"" and ""solution_method2"" and ""solution_method2_with_bug_fix"" etc.  The README format gives me tons of space to write comments (and cross-reference other work), while the filename, incrementing from version to version, is a sort of diary stamp.<p>This works for directories too.  I tend to go only 2 directories deep on a given project.  The top level is for the task, e.g. a calculation or a figure for a paper I'm writing, and the second is for a sequence of approaches to that task.<p>With this scheme, I focus on README files and not names in a directory tree.  Colleagues who have tried this have found it weird at first, but then tend to prefer it to the ""informative name"" scheme they grew up with.<p>If databases were more convenient, I could imagine doing all my work with ""flattened"" filenames in a single directory.  I think that's what apple are moving toward, but they are thinking of application-specific work, so the application deals with the databases.   I prefer the README/filesystem structure because it lets me use tools like grep, etc.",1343299533

4295331,comment,4294911,4294911,3,0,robomartin,,,"There's a huge difference here between Mom, Dad and Uncle Fester using a computer and professional or business users.<p>The first set of users can be either lazy or oblivious to the idea of organizing their data --directories or databases, it doesn't matter.  It's a pile-o-stuff and they really don't think far beyond that.  For this class of users making it super-simple is a good idea.  You sort of have to protect them from themselves.<p>I know doctors who have absolutely no clue as to where their stuff is stored and have zero interest in investing fifteen minutes to learn the basics of directory structures and file management.  Zero.<p>The second set of users, the pro's and business users --to generalize-- are a different story.<p>Take the case of a company that designs physical products.  Each project is likely to live inside a directory structure segregating and organizing areas or work such as: mechanical design, schematic, pcb layout, bill of materials, design calculations, documentation, embedded firmware, FPGA code, cost calculations, marketing materials, packaging design, manufacturing, specifications, etc.  In turn, each of these categories will rightly have its own subdirectory structures when and where it makes sense.<p>The above per-product directory structure is also likely to be completely replicated as product releases and revisions require.  Not everything can be handled by Git-type version control systems.  In fact, in product design there are very good arguments for complete design duplication during iterations or to mark release (as shipped) configurations.  Different subject.<p>This second use case cannot be served well with the iOS app-centric sand-boxed model.  A product directory structure with thousands of files can have a number of applications access these files.  There will not be a one-to-one correlation between applications and a lot of the files in the design.<p>Similar use cases can be found in other businesses where the end-product might not be a physical product design.  Research projects, financial reports, publications and other work product is likely to require a number of different file types that may or may not come together to form a single deliverable.<p>Again, the iOS sand-boxed model fails to support this use case because it forces a per-file-type or per-application separation of files and does not permit or provide the ability to organize disparate file types into projects according to context.<p>Put another way:  If you are Lockheed you don't want the F-16 and F-117 mechanical design files mashed together into one folder simply because the same CAD system is used to open then.  You want them to live within their corresponding project stores and within a sensible directory structure that organizes work according to relevant criteria.  For example, the wing mechanical design directory might also contain a set of directories with aerodynamics data whereas the mechanical design directory for the seat has not need for such data.<p>I see that the Windows approach seems to work well for the first type of user.  If applications use it correctly (some don't) everything gets dumped into ""My Documents"" and other predefined folders.  Users would occasionally add sub-folders of their own.<p>The second set of users generally has the presence of mind and knowledge to ""roll their own"".  Using my own patterns as an example, I don't think I own a single computer (Mac or PC) that does not have a separate ""Data"" drive where projects are stored within their own directory structures and according to their own needs.<p>There's another twist to this, which is a far less common use case:  I happen to run more than one business.  There's zero justification for my Photoshop files from business #1 to be stored in the same location as those of business #2 on the same computer.  Each business has its own root directory from which to organize the corresponding files.",1343299278

4295316,comment,4294911,4295029,40,0,corford,,,"At home, I have a rack of shelves with box and manilla folders. Each one contains different things like house bills, banking statements, insurance docs etc. I find it completely natural and a very easy way to file stuff. When I go to the bank, I take my banking folder with me. When I go to the insurance company, I take my insurance folder with me. My Mum and Dad (and likely most other people in the world) also have a similar system in their house.<p>I store my digital files in a similarly compartamentalized, hierarchical manner. It may come as a surprise to you but my Mum and Dad (who are approaching 60 and are not exactly clued up computer users) also do the same thing on their PCs (dad with his various excel sheets and word docs, mum with her photos). Of all the brain dead questions they ask me to do with their computers and the various tech problems they have, understanding folders and using them is literally something that has never come up. The paradigm is immediately obvious to them and they find it a natural way to catalogue and store their files. This notion that a user is too lazy to organise their files is simply something I have NEVER seen (and I've seen quite a lot when it comes to bad computer users).<p>If my parents were to be given a computer that had no concept of directories it would be a disaster. They would be just as lost as when I try to explain to them that the email they see in Thunderbird is the same as the one they see via webmail because Thunderbird is accessing their mail account through IMAP. To them that just sounds like magic. They much preferred it when they used to get their email via POP. Oh, and guess how they organise their email? Yep, lots of folders. I don't think they've ever used the tagging and advanced search features offered by Thunderbird.<p>I'm the same and it would fill me with rage having to exclusively interact with all my files through a GUI front end to an sqlite database. Which effectively is what we're talking about here. I can't think of anything more non-intuitive or pointless.",1343298767

That's more like learning about inodes--something that's interesting but irrelevant to anyone but enthusiasts.<p>I would instead compare folders to knowing that your car's oil must be changed. (Who doesn't love a car analogy?)  You can survive without that knowledge, and you even can pay others to do it.  But it's very simple stuff, and at the very, very least, in order to (successfully) own a car you <i>must</i> know that the oil has to be changed every now and then, if not by you then by someone else.  It's a matter of fundamental knowledge of the tools you're using.<p>If you want to live without that knowledge, then it's your own fault really, because it's not hard to learn and every car ever made uses the concept.  It's in the manual.  If you don't want to learn it, are too lazy to, think it's too hard, or have different priorities, then that's cool--but don't expect car makers to put effort into molding cars to your whims, because it turns out oil is pretty useful in a car.<p>If a person was born in 1870 and decided to buy a car in 1930, well, it's up to them to learn that cars need their oil changed.  Age is not really an excuse, nor is being born to a different generation.<p>In either case, you're right: the general public will continue to be too uninterested to learn basic computing principles.

I am not starting a flame war, but those languages are just not interesting to me - or rather, they weren't until I stumbled upon Ruby.<p>I learned OOP via Java and hated it.<p>Over the last 3 - 4 years I have been teaching myself Ruby & Rails dev.

The issuer can easily include the client_id in the token and check for its revocation when used, as it did in OAuth 1. The same is true for self-encoding: clients don't have to issue self-encoded tokens and can instead issue unique id-style tokens with long expiry times. As for refresh, that's unfortunate but issuers could easily work around it if the OAuth 1 way was preferable.<p>In short, OAuth 2 is simpler to implement for the client in exchange for being slightly harder on the issuer, whilst also being more flexible. Yes, it relies on SSL for security. So does your bank.",1343297357

The only cases that matches your ""9/10 observations"" are the few guys using OSX, and even then many converted from Windows and keep using their OS just as they did before. And everybody else is using a system where he cannot easily organize stuff through apps (ie., we probably all agree that OSX has the best inter-app interoperability) or otherwise is experienced enough to want full control of their own data and therefore keeps his data organized, eg., in a Dropbox folder hierarchy. And given the majority of people I know are Windows users with very little ""IT knowledge"", their behaviour is what I would put into the majority bin. According to my own obeservations at least, nearly all of these user-types rely on some increadibly convoluted folder hierarchy to store their music, photos, documents and the odd video.<p>Note that I am not arguing about the best way to organize folders and files, all I am saying is that AFAIK the very large majority of users does organize their files in deep folder structures (and, is using Windows Explorer to do that, too...).",1343296921

Among teachers using the 70 staff computers in this large open plan office, there is an amazing variety of carefully organised folder structures and layouts that typically, for each teacher, organise 8 to 10 courses each consisting of two sessions a week for 36 weeks. With overlap. And shared folders with colleagues.<p>If we used Mac OS X instead of Windows, it it really is the case that you can only have one level of folder, then my colleagues would have to recreate their heirarchies using file naming conventions. Messy, and hard to manipulate.<p>A database approach might yield an actual benefit: I'm assuming that would look a bit like Outlook's message view where clicking on the from, received, subject fields allows an <i>instant</i> reordering of the material.

It is hard to see how that works for media files.<p>I have no issues with <i>changing</i> how we organise material, but there does seem to be a shift in assumptions on how people will use their computers towards the superficial media stoage and comsumption sort of model.

Why would I ever want to be somewhere else?  Because either a) I'm burnt out or b) Something is wrong with what I'm currently doing.<p>If it's (a), get out and exercise, socialize, etc.<p>But if it's (b), stop and take a good look at what you're currently doing.  Maybe your ""inner hacker"" knows it's not right.",1202396162
110932,comment,110894,110894,0,0,sonink,,,"I think what you are trying to do is extremely dangerous. 'Founder' is not just a title, its also a role - that role does not exist in your startup - understand that and let her also know the same. Otherwise you will just be lying to her and both of you will figure out in sometime which could lead to a major disagreements which is the biggest startup killer. If she is willing to take as much risk with as much commitment you can offer her a huge percentage of stocks which is something that she will value as much. Also, incase she thinks that your setup is a good match and understands the extreme difficulty of getting a committed startup team together she shouldnt have a problem with it.<p>Getting a committed and talented team which can work together is the hardest part of a startup.Everthing else almost always works out.  Consider this the biggest opportunity as well as the biggest challenge you face.",1202395504

That's different from your version of turtles.  Yours is not the enormous waste of time that the ""environment turtles"" are.<p>However, I'm still not sure whether consistency is really that important.  People seem to do ok with some inconsistencies and warts in their languages, and continue to favor languages with warts and weirdnesses and quick idioms to the ones under discussion (incidentally, what could we call Smalltalk/Scheme/Forth to group them together?).<p>Since there are many factors that contribute to popularity and diffusion of languages, it's hard to pin down what has kept those languages from being as popular as many people think they ought to be, but it's a question worth asking.<p>Naturally, I think the more people are aware of languages like that, the better.  It's good for your brain and a great way of expanding your concepts of how to do things.",1202394923

110923,comment,110792,110792,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Overall, I really like your idea of using whitespace to serve ads.  I'd much rather offer those on my site than other types of ads.  I think the over all concept works.  If you study animation and motion desing, you realize that a viewer's eye is attracted by motion in an image.  So, I think that it's a good idea, to have the slow fade in/fade out on the ads.  It's not jarring, and abusive, I like that.  Another strength is that the ad fades in beside the user's mouse cursor.  So the user's eyes are probably looking at that part of the screen to begin with.  Because of that, I suspect that you will continue to have better than average conversion rates.  Congrats.<p>Constructive criticism:<p>Logo:  From a design perspecive, it seems a little cramped between the ""pt"" in empty and the angle of the thought bubble.  I'd like a little more space there, and perhapse angle the balloon a little bit, so it is lower below the ""pt"" and higher beside the ""ds"" in ""spaceads"".  Just a thought.   I think the logo is a good start, but it could use a little more work.<p>Company Name:  In the design world, the term ""white space"" is used to describe what you're calling ""empty space"".  If you're going after designers, that might be a plus.  I don't know if you've done any domain name searches involving ""white space"", but at least to me, it would be a clearer explanation of what your company is doing than ""empty space"".<p>Front page design:  Over all, I like the color scheme.  However, the white on orange, ""Sign up Now"" and ""Learn More,"" buttons are hard to read.<p>Front page copy: I had a couple of issues.  The phrase, ""Publishers turn your site's empty space into cash money"" is a little problematic for me.  The term ""Publisher"" communicates to me a magazine or book publisher, not a blogger or content creator.  Those are your target demographic, I'd make it obvious I'm referring to them on my front page.<p>Also, the phrase, ""cash money"" is redundant and bugs me a bit.  Copy like that is used in payday loan services or used car sales.   It cheapens the service in my mind. I'd think that, ""Bloggers. Change your site's blank space into cash."" or something along those lines would be stronger copy.<p>Demo page:  I didn't really like the quality of the ads that were served in the demo.  It appears that you're using live ads from your ad network.  I'd rather see something well designed rather than what comes in randomly off the ad network.  I think that you'd get people's attention a bit easier.  My first impression when I look at your site, is this: ""Wow, looks pretty good.""  My first impression when I look at the demo ads is: ""Huh???  What is that picture of?  Oh, it's an ad for a hand bag... I think.""  The images that I saw on several re-loads were small and pixelated and frankly, I was turned off.  I know that you might not have a lot of control over that, because you're only working with one ad affiliate.  But for your demo, I'd make a different choice.<p>Demo page design:  Just a simple thing, but my eye was attracted to the bright green in the pie chart first.  That's not the most important part of your demo.  It was a little distracting for me.<p>Again, I'm not trying to nit pick.  I'm tryin to give what was asked for:  an honest critique.  Over all, I think that you're well on your way.  Good job, and you're off to a great start.  Keep it up.",1202393949
110922,comment,110541,110872,0,0,davidw,,,"I don't mean that <i>everyone</i> is that obsessed; suffice it to say that enough people have the mentality that they want their entire environment to be in Lisp/Scheme/Smalltalk (the last of which is pretty much that way by design) to have created a culture that is, on average, more concerned with that kind of thing than the scripting languages were - they were too busy getting things done, piggybacking on Unix, C, and Windows to some degree.  Note that the Java people have also gone in big for 'turtles all the way down', but that's easier with millions of Sun dollars at your back.<p>My point wasn't that Scheme/Lisp/etc... are impractical languages, or unusable for real work, but more along the lines of ""ok, these are great languages, languages that have changed the way everyone thought - so why aren't they more popular?  What went wrong?""<p>One very specific example - I recall fooling around with Scheme a while ago, and the implementation I was using didn't even have a string-split (string -> list).  Easy to implement?   Sure, but also evidence that it wasn't being used for the sort of practical things I wanted to do with it.",1202393642

110918,comment,110894,110894,0,0,cperciva,,,"By definition, the ""founders"" of a company are the people who ""founded"" it.  If you join after the company is founded, you're not a founder.  That said, there's a lot of pressure to interpret this liberally: Early hires (such as the designer mentioned) want to be called ""founders"" since it sounds far more impressive, and potential sources of funding (YC included!) are happier if people are described as ""founders"" because it suggests a greater degree of commitment.<p>My personal view is that the set of ""founders"" should at very least be limited by the set of individuals who have worked for a company while receiving any cash compensation.  If you're paying someone a salary plus stock options, they're an employee as far as I'm concerned.",1202393428
110917,comment,110894,110894,0,0,Todd,,,"I think if anyone is willing to work with no income for options, it's OK to call them founders. Anyone pre-VC is basically a founder anyway. There will never be any doubt about who the 'real' founder is. In the end, it's more important for you to know that you're the majority shareholder than for others to know who the founders are. You get to sit on the board and you get to have the most control.",1202393422

110914,comment,110541,110828,0,0,raganwald,,,"> I've always taken ""turtles all the way down"" to mean the fixation that Lisp/Forth/Scheme/Smalltalk/etc... people get about implementing everything in their language of choice<p>That's how I take it as well. I wrote this to point out that Turtles all the way down languages make it easier to make consistent languages. I get that you don't care for that.<p>> Turtles all the way down is a philosophy where you try to define a ridiculously minimal set of orthogonal axioms and build the language by combining those axioms...<p>> But the advantage of having everything in the language built on top of a small set of axioms is that when you want to make a new feature possible, it's often just a case of burrowing down a level of abstraction and combining the existing things in new ways. For example, it could be as simple as rewriting select to return generalized variables instead of values... if Ruby really treated ""="" as a method instead of treating it as a special case that is sometimes a method and sometimes something else and sometimes a third thing.<p>> Elegant is often a thing to be admired from afar, rather than something you use every day.<p>""Elegance"" sounds like some effete aesthetic quality, there's no point in debating that word. Instead, I am asking you to think about consistency and discoverability, qualities that have a direct relationship to the programmer's ability to translate thought into programs.",1202393267

C-Corp that startups focus on and they shouldn't.<p>Second, think of founders as your YC group (if you were to apply). If she would be part of your YC group (the group that is the core of the company at this stage), then she's a founder. Usually being a founder also implies a class of stock.<p>Third, you should always hire people smarter and give them compensation that makes them happy and aligned with your company. If she's worth it to moving the company foward, then go ahead and call her ""founder."" She's got to be in it for the long haul though.

I am guessing the ad creator/publisher will be able to choose the border color - so I won't go there.   Will the advertisers be able to create Flash ads?  I agree with mixmax; I think the ads should be relevant to the content of the site.  I noticed that your the only founder; since you know what your doing from a programming point of view, I'd look for a co-founder who has a design background.  Once again I like what you are doing.",1202392923

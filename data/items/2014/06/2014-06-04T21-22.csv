If not for my friends, I&#x27;d easily slide into a comfortable hermit existence. And every time I do, it harms me in the long term and I usually only realize this when I look back.<p>Like most other things, I suppose, it&#x27;s about finding a balance. My &#x27;balance&#x27; probably lies on the &#x27;hermit&#x27; end of the spectrum, but I still find that social engagements are essential in the long run.<p>While it&#x27;s possible that some are &#x27;true&#x27; hermits or &#x27;true&#x27; socialites, I doubt it.",1401919185
7848670,comment,7843664,7844916,1,0,nilium,,,"Currently working on another patch to fix some newfound crashes while prepping the code for open sourcing. License headers and all that.<p>Plan for now is to release it under the GPL version 2 or 3 to hopefully compel people to make their modifications available (plus there&#x27;s not much use for a lenient license here -- it&#x27;s not a library, though some of the code could be moved to one later). This might take a day or so, so I expect this post to disappear into complete obscurity before I&#x27;m done. Might create a new HN submission for that just to let people know. At any rate, my net access is down so I have to write this on my phone, meaning any release is going to wait on my ISP to determine what&#x27;s up and how to resolve the issue.<p>So, open source is planned, I&#x27;ll just suck it up as I usually do when I release every other project of mine.

I just came back from this year&#x27;s AGE conference in San Antonio, which is very much a mainstream research conference, and not only was it partially sponsored by SENS, but de Grey himself was there.<p>So yes, they are very much aware of it. I think many aging researchers have a love/hate relationship with SENS, in that they share its goals in theory, but are afraid its ambitious public claims will draw disrepute (and associated loss of funding) upon the field.<p>You have to remember that we are mostly funded by the NIH, whose mandate is to treat disease, and aging is not widely considered a disease.

I love that my not-yet-two son disappears and plays in hidden corners. He&#x27;s probably longer out of my (and my wife&#x27;s) sight than the boy in that car was, albeit in our apartment.

Are there other missions that may excite you more? Doesn&#x27;t it seem a little quick to start evaluating solely based on this external actor (recruiter) contacting you? Maybe Google or Pinterest or Reddit or Watsi would also be interesting?<p>Are you happy with your lifestyle right now?<p>How does this tie to your larger aspirations? If 3 years of banking gets you a ticket to an MBA, or the right amount of capital for you to start a business, maybe it is worth staying.<p>More specific to Palantir:\nDo you have any ethical issues with Palantir&#x27;s work? The company seems like it is doing a fair bit of soul searching about how its tools are used, and what its responsibility to the public is. I am not trying to answer this question nor prompt that discussion, but this may be an aspect of the work you should evaluate.<p>If you look around, you&#x27;ll find Palantir has a hard salary cap, so your mention of compensation is likely to be a relatively underwhelming value compared to tech M&A work.

If I like the OS X notification center quite a bit and its integration with 3rd party applications I use a lot, then it may well cause me to lean in the direction to purchase a MacBook over a Lenovo. Of course they&#x27;re all taken as parts of a whole, but it&#x27;s still conceivable that people may not be able to perform their job/task in a way that they are accustomed to without X feature.<p>In addition, while some features may not sway you, it is not unlikely that you are an exception to the rule.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/31/10017567.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/31/10017...</a>",1401917912

I mean, it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re Alcoa, an aluminium smelter, but let&#x27;s take a look at bulk prices:<p>Aluminium costs $1.80/kg: <a href=""http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=aluminum"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=aluminum</a><p>Alumina, the product of the aluminium-air reaction, costs ~$0.45/kg: <a href=""http://www.indexmundi.com/en/commodities/minerals/bauxite_and_alumina/bauxite_and_alumina_t6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indexmundi.com/en/commodities/minerals/bauxite_an...</a><p>The cost of refining aluminum from ore, <i>in bulk</i>, is therefore >$1.35/kg (otherwise, Alcoa would be cleaning up on the commodities market). The cost of a 3000km battery with 100kg of aluminium is therefore $135, or roughly 4.4 cents per kilometer, or 7 cents per mile.<p>That&#x27;s nearly as expensive as gasoline, <i>going off of commodity metal prices and assuming absolutely no overhead or profit margin</i>. That&#x27;s not to mention the environmental consequences of aluminium refining w.r.t. the massive amount of energy therefor required.<p>It&#x27;s impressive tech, but it&#x27;s not feasible. The Hall-Héroult process has been the subject of intense scientific scrutiny for over 100 years; everyone and their brother has tried to make it more efficient: <i>we use aluminium for everything</i>. Aluminium is not going to get any easier, barring massive breakthroughs in fusion energy and/or the Second Coming.<p>EDIT: Originally my calculated cents/mile was off by a factor of 10. However, the latter point, &quot;nearly as expensive as gasoline&quot;, stands: it costs $250 for a gas car to drive 3000 km, at 30 mpg and $4/gallon.

Specifically with his JavaScript example, I think it&#x27;s very plausible that using integers instead of IEEE754 would incur a 10% overhead if you were throwing lots of big enough numbers around.<p>What the author really wants is a hardware BIGNUM implementation, not overflow trapping. I just don&#x27;t think he really thought it through.<p>His contention that simply checking for overflow in C or C++ incurs a 5% overhead is unquestionably false though. Typically one would check for integer overflow in C like this:<p><pre><code>  unsigned int do_addition(unsigned int a, unsigned int b)\n  {\n\tunsigned int tmp;\n\n\ttmp = a;\n\ta += b;\n\tif (a < tmp)\n\t\tasm volatile (&quot;nop;&quot; ::); /* Handle it here */\n\n\treturn a;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAny decent compiler will do the right thing (GCC with -Os):<p><pre><code>  0000000000000000 <do_addition>:\n     0:\t89 f0                \tmov    %esi,%eax\n     2:\t01 f8                \tadd    %edi,%eax\n     4:\t73 01                \tjae    7 <do_addition+0x7>\n     6:\t90                   \tnop\n     7:\tc3                   \tretq\n</code></pre>\nI think rwallace is absolutely right in saying the overhead of such a check would be very close to zero in the non-overflow case.",1401917707

Isn&#x27;t sexual language and imagery a pervasive part of the human experience? Isn&#x27;t the problem specifically with sexual language and imagery which disempowers and objectifies people against their will? With language as general as that, you could outlaw a glance paired with a half-smile given by someone in Victorian garb completely covered from the neck down and wrists up. I&#x27;ve said it before: Maybe a Victorian level of carefully maintained polite deniability could facilitate greater consensuality, so long as it&#x27;s absent the Victorian level sexual inequality and doublethink. (It could also be used in the opposite direction.)<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with the notion that the language of human sexuality has been twisted in unhealthy ways to support the status-quo power structure. I&#x27;ve personally been on the short end of that deal. However, I do disagree with emotionally driven backlash devoid of consideration that seeks to vilify. Traditional cultures have already tried shaming, fear, and repression as instruments of control over human sexuality. How about we start to further consensuality and open communications instead? And for that, the atmosphere created by vilification is only unhelpful.<p>What we have here is a fundraising rave that&#x27;s using sex in its marketing of an event at a nightclub. Nightclubs are supposed to be sexually charged. It suffuses the music and couture around such venues. What if a similar event had happened at a gay club, with the photo shot with two beautiful young men in the same garb and with the same poses and facial expressions? Would Techweek have come after them?<p>It seems like Techweek needs to clarify its policies surrounding concurrent events. It&#x27;s a typical organizational response to greatly overshoot on the side of caution. Hopefully, this will be understood as just that.<p>EDIT: Downvote, eh? Funny how the stance of &quot;You&#x27;re either for us or against us&quot; is cited as a sign of George W.

There are certain things that have their costs driven down very easily by technological innovation (consumer goods, electronics, transport, etc) and certain things that are very resistant, at least on short and medium time scales (healthcare, education, land for obvious reasons).  Being increasingly able to afford things like Internet and cars may make it seem like someone CAN&#x27;T be &quot;poor&quot; because rich people 40 years ago didn&#x27;t have it, but that&#x27;s a lot less significant than their relative ability to access the (much more important) things in the second category.

Python gives, by default, integers that aren&#x27;t bounded, so overflow doesn&#x27;t happen. Of course, under the hood, it must be keeping track of all the bits of the number somehow, and determining when it can&#x27;t store a section of the integer in the underlying uintxx_t; it must use some sort of overflow here, even if perhaps it&#x27;s not truly overflowing. Integer objects (for those interested) are 28 bytes by default and more if they get larger; a rough test with multiplication just now seems to take ~25-50ns (compared to ~2-3ns for a int32t in C) and in my experience, most of the time, this doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>With this flurry of new languages, I had hoped to see more of &quot;integer&quot; just being an integer, and fixed-sized integers being a special case. Often, I feel I really don&#x27;t know what the bounds on the input will be. (Sometimes, there aren&#x27;t, aside from available memory constraints.) Obviously, there will need to be code that needs to run fast and can use a more restrictive type.<p>Something like, `ranged_integer<0, 200>`, which I can use when I know my inputs should never exceed [0, 200], and has some well-defined behavior if I over/underflow. (Or even, configurable!) In the `ranged_integer<0, 200>` case, I&#x27;d expect the compiler/library to be able to easily optimize that into a `uint8_t`. (You could have `native::uint8_t`, which is just whatever the processor has, and you&#x27;re on you&#x27;re own, but it&#x27;s more obvious that you&#x27;re on your own.)",1401916071

That particular court seems heavily pro-business right now. The legal system works better when appeals court judges across the country make decisions, and the supreme court manages the splits.</i><p>The author of the original article probably doesn&#x27;t remember the days before the Federal Circuit was created.  Except for the then-rare cases when the Supreme Court intervened, judicial interpretations <i>and applications</i> of patent law could vary widely among the different courts.  The validity of a patent often depended heavily on where the lawsuit was filed.  Some courts were known as graveyards for otherwise-good patents.  The federal district court in Minnesota was one such place, along with its appellate court the Eighth Circuit.<p>That often led to patent owners and accused infringers racing to get their lawsuits filed first:  A patent owner would try to sue the accused infringer first in a patent-friendly court, while the accused infringer would try to sue the patent owner first in, say Minnesota, asking for a &quot;declaratory judgment&quot; of invalidity and non-infringement.  Under the procedural rules, usually whoever won the race to the courthouse got to keep their lawsuit alive, while the second-place filer would have their lawsuit dismissed.<p>That in turn led to great uncertainty in the scope, validity, and value of a patent.  Clients hate uncertainty.  That&#x27;s what led to the creation of the Federal Circuit:  To try to bring more uniformity to the judicial interpretations and applications of patent law.",1401915732

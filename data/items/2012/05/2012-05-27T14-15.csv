I don't really see this different from all the other patent licensing deals we have with the rest of the (wireless) industry. These are part of the way these standards are developed (available under FRAND licenses) and licensed.<p>If you want to bring in a moral perspective I personally feel that a  bigger problem is what to do about ""legal intercept"" features. Especially when selling equipment to countries with regimes that want to misuse them.<p>But lets say this included some trivial (or non-trivial) software patent and this jointly owned company started trolling a lot of individual developers and/or smaller companies. Then I would feel different about this.",1338130721

4030197,comment,4029239,4029834,7,0,kijin,,,"The research tested 1700 devices. A single device that is off by 42 years (reset to Unix epoch?) would have skewed the average by over 9 days.

The issue is with setting unrealistic goals, and NOT asking for advice / direction from experts (gym trainers in this case) early on. It's the same problem faced the world round for anyone starting out in a new field with unrealistic expectations and lacking patients.<p>Yes, going to the gym with no set plan and allowing this plan to evolve will encourage you to go more often if you are the type of person who sets unrealistic goals and gets dejected by not meeting them. But this, <i>I</i> think is NOT the best way to go about achieving your goals, it's a slower path, asking advice from experts will shorten your path.<p>And taking Arnold Schwarzenegger as a role model is not a fair motivator for ones efforts.

In many cases messages from devices and external systems are processed asynchronously, so there isn't much choice but to trust remote timestamps.. I may be getting data minutes or hours later. Just a distributed system challenge.<p>The time zone issue is a human one. Historically clinicians schedule doses at ""Every 3 hours"" or ""Once per day, 8am"". Humans figure out what that means, but a dose scheduling system that shifts 8am an hour after daylight savings (because it interpreted the schedule as ""every 24 hours"" is going to run aground with nurses when it tells them they're late). However, every 3 hours is pretty obviously an interval and likely shouldn't shift by 30% of the interval!<p>This isn't a distinction that clinicians are used to making, but as someone who had to write some of the first dose-scheduling systems focused on clinical accuracy, we ran into this challenge and did a lot of thinking about which schedules really meant 'intervals' of specific units of time and which ones meant 'due at these calendar times every day'.<p>It's an interesting example of a problem that introducing technology introduces/exposes while showing up to fix other things.",1338130010

Anything with a computer, even a microcontroller, and basic network connectivity can use NTP, it is an extremely simple protocol.<p>Anything that doesn't connect to a network could be kept in sync via a wireless pulse/tick, though then you have security issues unless you cryptographically sign the clock signal.

If the folks managing the hospital were rational, shouldn't there be a regulation to use GMT and 24-hour clock?

I've found that on HN there's a large number of 20-something geeks who are book-smart but life-dumb, as well as a large percentage folks who are frankly very close to being sociopaths, if not outright sociopaths. So yeah, a lot of HN readers are going to be utter pinheads when it comes to debating about healthcare. The reality of people's health experiences is very messy, very random, extremely stressful and utterly terrifying and unfair at times. It's not about simply shopping for the lowest price on some commodity at a local store. It's about a loved one who is vomiting blood and you don't know why and it's 2am. It's about being told you need medical insurance then getting denied because you have a pre-existing health imperfection on some long list of terms -- no shit, sherlock, right? It's about the primary breadwinner of a family being diagnosed with cancer at age 30. It's about an expecting couple being told that based on tests of their fetus that the baby is very likely to have Down's syndrome. </i><p>Guess what? Not too long ago, I had a random, extremely stressful, and utterly terrifying healthcare situation and it involves me, bleeding lot of blood and not knowing why. It just so that I have a different perspective.<p><i>So fuck shopping around. Fuck the market. Fuck economics. Fuck capitalism. Fuck the Republican and really the Libertarian outlook. Fuck everyone who thinks it's every man for himself, I got mine, everyone else can go fuck themselves.

Say you're running a 100-yard dash. Or playing a video game contest. Those are true competitions, may the best man wins. But when you're sick, your family, a neighbor, a fellow citizen, that is precisely the time when it is NOT okay and NOT humane or civilized to think like that.</i><p>I don't give a rat ass about capitalism, socialism, or any political ideology, just that the healthcare system works esave as many lives as possible and preferably without charging an arm and a leg for said medical care.<p>So either show why I am wrong or don't comment at all.",1338127477

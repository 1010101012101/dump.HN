In particular, Young confessed to the burglary that he was suspected of, and was in possession of several of the stolen items. (We don&#x27;t know why those charges were dismissed, but perhaps it was because the local authorities didn&#x27;t think it was worthwhile to pursue a case against someone who&#x27;d be in federal prison for a longer term than he could get for the burglary charges.)<p>From the sentencing memo:<p><i>On October 1, and October 3, 2011, the Chattanooga Police Department (CPD) received reports of several burglaries of storage building and vehicles. There was video surveillance of the areas burglarized and a suspect car was identified which CPD Detective Tomisek was able to trace to the defendant. On October 5, 2011, Detective Tomisek went to the defendants residence and received consent to search from the defendant. Detective Tomisek and two other officers witnessed the defendant sign a written consent to search from for, among other  places, the defendants residence.<p>Detective Tomisek found several stolen items and seven shotgun shells. The shells were in a box in a chest of drawers next to the defendants bed. While Detective Tomisek was holding the shells in his hand, the defendant voluntarily stated that they were his. The defendant later gave a taped statement in which he confessed to the burglaries. The defendant admitted to having his son help him load the stolen property into his car. The defendant was a convicted felon at the time he possessed the ammunition having sustained at least the following felony convictions: four Aggravated Burglaries, three Burglaries, five Thefts.</i>",1376189992

Weeks (months?) later, I am still learning how to be a &quot;good&quot; C++ programmer.<p>I remember &quot;learning&quot; PHP when I was younger and could probably program quite a few things with it still but I am definitely not a PHP programmer. I have no idea what is considered good or bad practice in PHP land. I could solve a bunch of Project Euler problems in PHP but I could not write a secure PHP application for actual use.<p>The same goes for most languages I can think of. I&#x27;ve fiddled around with it, written a few small programs, gotten a feel for the standard library, but unless I use that language on a decent sized project I have nothing but a superficial understanding of it.<p>If you already know how to program, &quot;learning&quot; a new language is trivial, you can do it in a few days, sometimes even a few hours. Learning to write &quot;good&quot; code in that language is not something that is easy to pick up or something that is transfers between languages, even closely related languages like C and C++ or C# and Java.",1376188473

There isn&#x27;t anywhere near the number of libraries that Python and Ruby have, nor anywhere near the general level of quality, but you can do an awful lot without ever touching C. Reams of Lua code have been written to script WoW by people who have no idea how to program in C. In fact, one of the primary design objectives of Lua is to have a language that&#x27;s simple for non-programmers to learn.<p>> you&#x27;re going to be looking around for easy, plug-and-play libraries and wondering why they don&#x27;t exist.<p>That&#x27;s very true. I spent the better part of a year working on open source web development libraries in Lua but eventually gave up because nobody was using them. There are fantastic libraries in Python and Ruby, at this point it&#x27;s not really worth reinventing the wheel just to do the same stuff, but in Lua.<p>The interesting thing about the Lua community is that very few people use Lua as their primary day-in-day-out language, which leads to a distinct lack of fanboyism. I think that&#x27;s in part why so few libraries exist. The typical Lua programmer attitude seems to be, &quot;Why should I rewrite that in Lua when I can just use the one written in <insert language here>?&quot;",1376188386

Few people are going to throw away any electronic device they own when they have the slightest suspicion about it.<p>My opinion is that specific goals should be acknowledged and agreed upon. These are things that will do little or nothing to protect dangerous criminals but will prevent dragnet surveillance, political blackmail, and what essentially amounts to a consolidation of power by kleptocrats (which is either the state the US is in now, or will soon be.)<p>The following are goals, each representing its own layer. A) would be a very good start. Each additional layer is helpful, but the first priority is A.<p>A) The end of plain text communication. There is no reason two parties communicating digitally should have their communication readable by anyone with access to the data stream. Ignore the NSA for a moment, any nation your data passes through you should assume is being spied on -- very serious espionage concerns for any business public or private.<p>B) Client side end to end encryption when two parties are communicating with each other. Currently this would put an end to contextual email advertising, stifle history, search indexing, and usage metrics collecting. However, there are potential options here such as Crypton.io.<p>C) Open source software as a service. Lavabit, Silent Circle, and others have a big dilemma -- they can not prove they are not spying on their users. If a software-as-a-service provider is the one doing the encryption, even &quot;client side&quot;, there is the possibility of a security compromise, through a court order or otherwise, by modifying how the software executes. Most certainly an astute security researcher would discover something was amiss. The average user may not. The more serious issue is rather the destruction of that business&#x27;s credibility when a problem is discovered (this is hacker news after all, presumably you are here because you run a start up or internet business.)<p>The best solution -- separate the encryption layer from the service provider. Dropbox (allegedly soon to be complicit with PRISM) can&#x27;t provide a lot when a user syncs a TrueCrypt volume. What about Silent Circle? Is it really secure? Or Spideroak? We don&#x27;t know. While their work is admirable, forced automatic updates could break the security. Lack of source code means lack of public auditing.<p>Both Silent Circle and Spideroak could alter their business models to become substantially more secure. For example, if a particular country has a draconian data retention law and you operate in that country, then your business should not store data nor have any business interest in storing data.<p>There are numerous trends that have made security slide out of fashion. We want metrics on everything to optimize our UX. We want deep demographic, behavioral, and contextual data to maximize the amount of money advertisers can spend. Users want plug and play software that just works with the press of a button. View all of these as both obstacles and opportunities to build better versions of what exists today. Software development is getting cheaper, easier, and faster by the day, unlike, say, drilling for oil.<p>Good luck.",1376187372

I ran the numbers for 64k but you don&#x27;t need to go as large.<p>It&#x27;s not clear that this sort of linear progression presented is real.  Some math problems don&#x27;t see any progress in a long time and some see big progress rapidly.  Seems to me like it&#x27;s trying to find a pattern where there isn&#x27;t one necessarily.<p>To conclude.  RSA may fall tomorrow.  ECC may fall tomorrow.  AES may fall tomorrow.  I agree with the principle we need to have some agility built in to cryptosystems (though if it falls we&#x27;re kind of screwed).  Maybe we need to <i>combine</i> cryptosystems such that one breaking won&#x27;t take us down.  Added complexity and changes create attack opportunities (at least current implementations are battle hardened).",1376187349

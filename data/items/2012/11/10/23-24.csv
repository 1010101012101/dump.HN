Occasionally you might get a software bundle, like Office, or Quicken, but literally just drop it in the trash and you are done with it.

4768195,comment,4766316,4766690,1,0,xvolter,,,"I would agree with using the Internet, though I would not limit to any particular site, tutorial, or guides. I personally learned most of the programming I know from Google searches on per-case needs - the easiest solution is find something you want to create - way back when my project was to recreate MySpace - nowadays it may be a mobile app, a web services, or whatever you desire - then start building it - as you need to accomplish something new, learn that bit. You can also escalate your project if you start off small and build it - such as if you want to create a multiplayer mobile app, there are a ton of steps you can break up into smaller projects to learn all the aspects.<p>I find that people who learn CS from non-top-tier-tech colleges or from books tend to be limited in their knowledge, relying more on books and reference sheets than stronger programmers who learned by trial and error. People who learn how to program from external sources tend to be more narrow in their programming styles, following a single type or development, programming, project structure, and even languages - many are so limited they struggle to learn a new language, when a stronger program can pickup new languages quickly and entirely new programming styles.<p>Of course this is limited to programming for the most part.  If you are going to be more focused on another aspect, the approach may be different. Learning hardware is more hands on and is harder to do through Google searching - in this aspect of CS, I'd strongly recommend some books to assist - also taking apart and rebuilding a computer or laptop is always fun if you haven't done so.<p>There are also other aspects to CS - if you are more descriptive with what you want to learn HN may be able to give some better replies.",1352591521

4768189,comment,4767789,4767789,28,0,beloch,,,"First of all, this guy's biggest mistake was failing to format his drive and start with a clean Windows install.  Installing windows requires far less effort than cleansing a vendor's install of crapware.  Users should <i>not</i> have to do this.  I must fully agree that MS needs to start restricting what Vendors like HP can install on the PC's they sell.<p>Second, I'm very curious to see how the Windows App store plays out.  The #1 thing it needs to do to improve Windows as an OS is <i>distribute free software</i>.  There is a lot of excellent free software available for windows like chrome, firefox, VLC, foobar2000, texmaker, Notepad++, uTorrent, etc..  Users have to go to different websites to download everything. This is such a pain that people have come up with installers, like ninite, that aggregate free software together into a single download.  Ninite doesn't have everything I use, but it can easily shave hours off of setting up a new Windows box!<p>One major advantage of an App store is that software distributed through it can be policed for malware and viruses.  If MS could get users to use their store as much as possible there is the potential to improve security of the OS.  The only way MS can do this is to build their store up as a trusted and comprehensive distribution center that is <i>all</i> most users need.  MS should view it as a failure on their part whenever users are forced to go elsewhere to get software, even software that competes with Microsoft products or which duplicates core functionality of the OS.  That's where Apple's App store failed!  In order to do this, MS needs to devote resources to lowering the barrier to publication in their store.  Don't get me wrong, I am dead-set against Windows moving towards an entirely walled-garden iOS style ecosystem.  The ability to install software from outside the store should be preserved, nor should it be limited in any way.  However, I would welcome a central distribution point for Windows software like what Linux has.<p>Debian's APT package management system is brilliant.  Even 10 years ago it would have made today's Apple App store look sad and pathetic.  It is both comprehensive and incredibly smart in how it makes software modular with clear dependencies that are managed automatically for the user.  This is the dream that all application stores should aspire towards.  Redmond and Cupertino, for the love of your users, <i>please start your copiers</i>.",1352591446

If a company uses some camera-based DRM scheme to take away that ability, you have a tension between your rights to the use of copyrighted works and the government-enforced anti-circumvention rules in the DMCA.<p>This is another area (with closely related time-shifting and device-shifting) that companies will overstep their bounds on if allowed, in order to lock in consumers, and it is again via the enforcement of the government. That seems to fall under the area of things you oppose.<p>If all we had to worry about was the inconvenience of a legal jailbreak, I would let lemming consumers twist in the wind as well.<p>(all this is fairly theoretical, as it relies on someone getting this scheme to work even somewhat reliably, but the point stands for much of the copyright overreaches we face today)",1352591383

4768183,comment,4767841,4767841,14,0,weavejester,,,"I have a couple of suggestions.<p>1. If you return a handler function from a Compojure route, the handler is evaluated with the request. So:<p><pre><code>    (GET ""/"" request (posts/all request))\n</code></pre>\nIs the same as:<p><pre><code>    (GET ""/"" [] posts/all)\n</code></pre>\nSo there's no need for a separate ""route"" macro.<p>However, passing the full request map is discouraged, because the more information you give a function, the more things can theoretically affect it. Functions should be limited in what they know and what they can do, and this is one of the principles Compojure is designed around.<p>2. Some of the macros you've written for Korma could be written as functions instead. For example:<p><pre><code>    (defn paginate [query page per-page]\n      (-> query (limit per-page) (offset (dec page))))\n\n    (post/all (where conditions) (paginate page per-page))</code></pre>",1352591245

In Kotlin, you have to explicitly declare nullable types, and Rust does not allow references/pointers to be null in the first place if I am not mistaken. I have just recently started learning more about Scala, and although it allows nulls to be passed, they are not idiomatic, and I am guessing it would not be too hard to have an automatic style checker that catches uses of null (at least those that do not interface to Java libraries).",1352591230

The argument that they have 'cheapened' themselves to have a product bounded on either side (iPod touch, iPad 10"") with high PPI displays.<p>Those kinds of moves can be disconcerting.<p>However that Apple will change as it ages should not be unexpected.

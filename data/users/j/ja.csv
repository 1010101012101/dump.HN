JamesRougeau,0,1,0.0,1,0,"Hi, I'm James Rougeau and I live in my car! Yes, I had lived in my car for 6 months beginning in March 2009. After that time I have moved into the back of my delivery truck for 3 years. I moved into a hotel 4 months ago, and now am back in the truck again(genius or crazy? lol) I started teaching myself HTML & CSS a little less than 2 years ago. I am working on an old school online hub...www.GpsYou.com. After comparing yahoo(post office), amazon(local mall), ebay(my garage sale), facebook(after school phone call) etc that replaced the areas of my life as I grew up(I'm 48 yrs old)...I had a thought!!! Whoever creates the ""home address"" online will be a big player. I began building www.GpsYou.com to be that place. To create a profile where:     \nYou can promote all of your social and business ventures at your discretion in a single profile. It lets people view all of your websites and brick & mortar projects in one place. Now you can list all your social, blog, video, photo, e-store, im, family, email, website, network marketing, and brick/mortar ventures in..\nYour GPS.\nIt's also a US phonebook and hard web directory. The code is basic due to my limited abilities(learning everyday.) It's a novel idea and thae advantage to the ""hard directory"" is that advertisers can place a banner(page specific)ad at the top of every single page of the phonebook. For ex: If you're looking in the phonebook in Houston, Tx for a tractor..then the only banner ads on the top of that ""Tractor"" page will be for tractor sales and equipment etc...No pesky dating ads. Several thousand page phonebook with 5-10 banner ads on top(not side) for income just on the phonebook section. There is also a web directory to find every possible website and social website categorized. And it also has a GPS Profile Directory to find GPS Member Profiles which is non proprietary, so it promotes everyone's site. Please look at the ""GPS Sample"" to see what your GPS would look like. It is old school, but the advertising potential per multiple specific pages is unlimited. \nP.S. Microsoft owns www.GPS.com and Internet Solutions owns www.YOU.com. So. I put GPS & YOU together and it was available, so I bought it...and perhaps it can be the internet ""home address."" Maybe a PipeDream...lol<p>Thanks very much from your favorite homeless, Hacker Wannabe,\nJames Rougeau contact@GpsYou.com or JamesRougeau_mail@yahoo.com\n409-433-3052(my delivery truck phone for www.PortArthurRent.com)<p>Oh yah...Go To My Official GPS...lol@\nwww.GpsYou.com/JamesRougeau",1360528275,

jayzalowitz,,1006,0.931818,74,165,"I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I write award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently. Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row.<p>I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes. I am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.<p>Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello, I was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject of numerous documentaries. When I&#x27;m bored, I build large suspension bridges in my yard.<p>I enjoy urban hang gliding. On Wednesdays, after school, I repair electrical appliances free of charge.<p>I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie. Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear. I don&#x27;t perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a travelling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles. Children trust me.<p>I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I once read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed several covert operations for the CIA. I sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery. The laws of physics do not apply to me.<p>I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals using only a mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prize winning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I have played Hamlet, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis.",1298950973,1452884657

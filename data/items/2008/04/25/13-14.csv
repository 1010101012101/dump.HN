You get a very SEO friendly store, access to Amazon's recommendation engine, review system, and a few more pretty good things. You can sell Amazon products, if you need to fill out some areas of your store, and you don't have to worry about shipping those. You also don't have any hosting fees or bandwidth fees, no matter how many visitors you get or how big you grow. The credit card processing fees are included, and there's no need to get a merchant account either, which for some people with bad credit is hard. And besides that, it saves a person who might not have a lot of programming skills a heck of a lot of time, which I think would also be worth a lot to some people.",1209130925

But not if you are already among your customers.  They have so many ideas, I can't keep up.  And I come up with many more watching them struggle.  They're the ones stuck with crappy software, trying to get stuff done every day.  They always tell me, ""If I only had this, then I could do that...""<p>Because I'm already so close to my customers, my problem isn't coming up with ideas; it's deciding which ones to run with.<p>Got technical skills but having trouble coming up with ideas?  Get away from your terminal and out into the field.  Problem solved.",1209130065

If you'll notice in the analogy you actually quoted I compared good design to a cover letter. (It's not perfect, but  what is?) Obviously if the product (aka the resume) is no good, the best cover letter in the world will not matter. And conversely, if you're product is good enough, you will be able to get away with bad/no design consideration.<p>-Wade",1209129753

There is probably a good reason for the poor performance and you should understand those reasons before assuming that another provider will fix your problems.<p>Generally you should probably avoid most shared hosting for business applications because you are at the mercy of bad neighbors.<p>You are also probably better off using your hosting budget to go for a similar priced VPS rather than a low end dedicated server (assuming lower end of budget scale.)  In other words, $80 per month will get you a horrible dedicated server or a pretty good VPS.<p>BTW, I also use Slicehost.",1209128635

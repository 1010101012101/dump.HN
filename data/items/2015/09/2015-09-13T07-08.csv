Is 1.7% not something to worry about? IIRC, Solar variance of 0.1% has correlated with a 0.32F temperature variance. If that relation were linear, that would amount to almost a 5.5F variance.<p>I&#x27;m not proposing this as a &#x27;hard scifi&#x27; model for a story, but you could tweak the scenario to get suitably scary failures (multiple shades)",1442127753

There was another kid who&#x27;d lived through the Balkans war, though I&#x27;m not as familiar with his story.<p>The dons probably have a bit of an egalitarian streak as well, preferring the hard-up kids (not just war of course) over the privately educated ones if there&#x27;s a choice.",1442127669

And the reason I can work this out is because I know about the Functor typeclass which has the function fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b, which does a similar job of lifting an input function into a higher context (in this case a functor context).",1442127608

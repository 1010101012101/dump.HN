3078667,comment,3078128,3078578,-3,0,jleyank,,,"I stopped while typing and thought who was ""big"".  I wasn't addressing the inventor portion, merely the entrepreneur.  Mr. Gates or Mr. Walton had far greater impact on the world as a whole than Mr. Jobs.  Mr. Ellison came to mind, as I wanted a few more names to add to the list.  Guys like Buffett aren't in this category, and I could not think of other industry players of the last 20-30 years.<p>I'd be willing to bet that the Amazon guy might end up on this list if current trends continue, as continued Amazon success might have the hollowing-out impact of Wal-Mart.  And you missed the point I was trying to make.  Jobs is different because he actually saw the product as more than a dollar sign.  His ""score"" was lower because of this, but we're all applauding his decision tonight.<p>And I don't count the computer or consumer electronics field as the best source of inventors.  The latter, in many ways, is noise.  The true inventions of the former occurred outside our date window (transistor, IC, microprocessor, ...)  To me, inventions like PCR, medical/biology/chemistry/computer syntheses or vaccines are better, more significant inventions.<p>Hell, Sony broke the ground with the Walkman.  Roddenberry thought up the iPad in a way.  But, again, Jobs had taste and he made sure (a) we knew that and (b) his products were intended to be more than revenue streams.<p>As a postscript, I suspect there's far, far more businesses sitting on piles of Oracle software than they'd like (but they're stuck and getting nailed for it).",1317865644

3078628,comment,3078128,3078539,29,0,nirvana,,,"Me. Right this moment, I'm in my parents house, where our little startup has moved (temporarily!) to create our MVP.<p>When I was a kid, my mother went back to college to finish the degree she'd abandoned when she got married.  She decided to study computer science. This was my first exposure to boolean algebra, and made me want a computer.  The Apple II was relatively new and visicalc was driving sales of it, and I wanted an Apple II so bad that I vowed that, if we couldn't afford one, by golly I was going to make one!  I started learning electronics, I started learning circuit design, I followed a series of articles in Byte Magazine by Steve Ciarcia titled ""build your own computer"".  I built my own computer.  I laid out the PCB, and manufactured it, I stocked it, I designed a video card (using discrete chips, not one of the ""video cards in a chip"" choices that came out later.)<p>But pretty quickly, I realized that I needed to learn how to program it.  I needed to learn assembly and to build an operating system, and so I put the computer hardware project on hold and started learning software.<p>When I went to college, I wanted to study EE (still in the hardware mode) but pretty soon ended up getting a job as a programmer for a small company.  I liked the small company atmosphere, and that got me hooked on startups.  So, I started my career (dropped out of college, like Steve) and worked for a bunch of startups so that I'd know what I needed to know before starting my own.<p>Along the way, I started dozens of small businesses.  I read everything Guy Kawasaki published. I followed Apple news religiously, even in the days prior to the internet. I eventually was able to afford a Macintosh and have been using them for about 20 years now.  I decided that design was important because I came to understand the Mac UI was designed. I read every crappy, money-grubbing, two-bit biography of Steve Jobs I could get my hands on.<p>I've never considered him to be a religious figure.  I'm not a cultist.  I don't worship him.  In fact, as was recently revealed by Wozniak, Jobs was an admirer of Atlas Shrugged, as am I.  Worship is the rejection of rationality, and rationality is what we both strived for.<p>As I work to build a brand new company now, having just filed the incorporation papers, I am conscious of the lessons Steve Jobs taught me.<p>They are not that you should make things pretty, or that marketing is more important than substance... quite the opposite.<p>Steve Jobs was a man of integrity.  In this day and age, that is so very rare.<p>Apple is a company that has always done its best to do right by its customers, even when its customers didn't know what the right thing was. (Eg: nobody needed a GUI, a laser printer, built in networking, 72dpi, or 300+ dpi displays, the iPad, or a touch interface, or any of hundreds of other things that didn't exit on the market before Apple invented them.)<p>Steve Jobs has often been characterized as mean tempered, but I think that he is a kind person.  All of the direct experiences I've had with him, he was vey kind.

The ""missing"" features on Apple products, especially in the 1.0 versions, are legion.<p>I think I'm feeling great pain right now, not because I'm an acolyte in the cult of mac, but because one of the few legitimate heroes of our age has died.<p>Steve Jobs was an unapologetic capitalist.  He recognized that by making great products, he'd improve people's lives, and as a result, he'd improve his own.<p>He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003.  The prognosis is not good there, and so he knew he had limited time left.  At that point he was a multi-millionaire if not already a billionaire.<p>How did he spend the last 8 years of his life?   Enjoying himself?  No.  He drove himself and Apple to build the next generation of the personal computer.  The iPad is as significant as the Apple II.<p>When he was a kid, Steve Jobs gave us the personal computer.  When he was dying, he gave us the next generation of computing.<p>I can think of nothing more heroic, than the positive impact on billions of people that will have...<p>... and what more could someone who is starting a company aspire to?",1317865126

Your other option, if you don't, is to finance with no money down.<p><i>find a way to finance a solid car from a reputable source</i><p>Didn't this whole thread start because people were flabbergasted that someone would dare finance a new vehicle while they were poor?

They are not crappy decisions.<p>Let's take the one you seem to be the most callous about, which is having a dog.  I'm assuming your not a dog person, so you don't have the same kind of attachment to a dog that others might.  Food for a mid-size dog is about $40 a month.  Assume the dog's already grown, you can skate by on that, assuming there's no major vet bills.<p>Now the idea that people will hit hard times, and immediately drown their dog in a river, or bring them to the pound, is ridiculous.  The site didn't make it a matter of people getting a new puppy for christmas when they already can't feed themselves, and for people to jump on the idea of having a pet that you're responsible for, and not immediately throwing them to the curb at the first sign of trouble, is unrealistic.  If you're having hard times, $40 is a small price to pay for companionship and unconditional love.<p>All told, $430 ($325+$65+$40) a month is $5,160 a year, for three things that you can make a real strong case for.  I simply cannot see spending that money as some kind of frivolous luxury of the irresponsible poor.<p>Look, we could all just live in squats, eat dumpstered food, not have cell phones, and only get clothes from a free box.

3078602,comment,3077165,3077165,0,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Is Silicon Valley really a hot bed of startups?  Let's see:<p>People do 'startups' border to border in the US, in communities tiny to huge.  Those startups might be a pizza carryout, electrical engineering company, franchised fast food restaurant, white tablecloth restaurant, law firm, CPA tax firm, auto body shop, photo studio, boutique dress shop, Web site design and programming firm, big truck/little truck product supplier, etc.  Yes, Silicon Valley has a high concentration per capita of venture funded information technology startups, but there are startups all over the US.<p>Do the venture funded information technology startups really need a very special environment to keep going?<p>Let's see:  An auto body shop, white table cloth restaurant, or even a lawn mowing service need more expensive capital equipment than an information technology startup.  E.g., just a lawn mower can cost $13,000, enough to buy parts enough to plug together 10 good servers.  A Web design firm anywhere in the US, or the world, has nearly all the same software challenges as a venture funded social Web site in Silicon Valley.<p>Does Silicon Valley really have a big advantage on the best creative work?<p>Let's see:  Let's look at some of the best creative work in, say, music:  How did Stradivari and Guarnieri build their violins, Vivaldi, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Paganini write for violin, Heifetz get started in violin all in really small communities where what they were doing was astoundingly rare and world class on an historic level?  I mean, who the heck was Mozart going to go to for help on how to write interesting, novel harmony?  Where was Bach going to learn about key modulations?  Who gave Mozart the crucial help he needed to write his operas or Bach to write his organ pieces or his violin 'Chaconne'?  No one.<p>Who helped Newton with optics, calculus, the law of gravity, and the second law of motion?<p>Who helped Watt with the steam engine?<p>The history of the best works in art, science, engineering, and technology is awash in people doing historic world class work in what in Silicon Valley would look like near total isolation.<p>So, (1) startups happen all over the US and (2) much of the best work in all of history happened in near isolation.  So, Silicon Valley is not needed for either startups or good work.<p>There's another candidate reason for the high per capita concentration of venture funded information technology startups in Silicon Valley:  On average and in nearly all cases, the venture partners have at best meager qualifications in anything technical yet have to justify their risky investments to their general partners and limited partners.<p>Their best justification is, may I have the envelope please?  Thank you.  Here is it:  ""Join the herd!""  So, get a place on Sand Hill Road or nearby and do much like everyone else does.  So, 'fit in'.  Talk to each other a lot like gossip among middle school girls.<p>So, net, what Silicon Valley has a high concentration of is not really startups but just venture funded information technology startups, and the reason is not that Silicon Valley is an especially good place for the entrepreneurs to get the work done but just that the venture funding is concentrated there because the venture partners do not have the qualifications to evaluate projects on their own and, instead, get along by fitting in and joining the herd.  Net, the concentration is due to the propensity of venture partners to form herds.<p>Once again I'm glad for US national security that the Silicon Valley venture partners are not DARPA, NSF, or NIH problem sponsors.",1317864537

Many tech companies did (and still do) write software. Apple, on the other hand, designs and builds products - software is an implementation detail. Apple's core is software as an end, not as a means.<p>Fifty years from now, I believe that programmer will be one of those hilarious dated occupations like typist or milkman. Asking if someone has wifi will be like asking if they're on the grid, and computers (and computing) will be so ubiquitous that they become invisible.<p>I don't think Steve Jobs contributed to computing any more than Martin Luther King contributed to literature. His legacy isn't in his tools, it's in how he used those tools to shape the world as he wanted.",1317863407

But making devices and interfaces that are beautiful and enjoyable to use on a daily basis is incredibly difficult, and ranks just as high on my list as PageRank or Cassandra.<p>Thanks to Apple (and Jobs), I've got technology from Star Trek sitting in my pocket -- an iPhone. It wasn't the first smartphone by a mile, but it was the first that was genuinely useful to everybody, which is why every other phone on the market has followed Apple's lead in interface design.<p>Call that 'marketing' if you will, but all of that 'marketing' has made the world a better place for a very large number of people in a direct and measurable way.",1317863397

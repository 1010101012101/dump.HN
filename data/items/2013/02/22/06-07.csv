5263092,comment,5262695,5262695,31,0,btilly,,,"This conversation has been up for over 2 hours, and nobody has noted that this fails the Open Source Definition at item 1?  You can verify that at <a href=""http://opensource.org/osd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.org/osd</a>.<p>More generally, when you sign a contract, or release something under a license, you should understand what you are doing, why you're doing it.  If the legal agreement doesn't accomplish what you want, then don't do it.  That goes whether you're a hobbyist, a business, are releasing open source for free, or are selling incredibly expensive per CPU licenses.  In general, releasing software for free is not the best way to get paid for the act of writing it.  That's common sense, and if that is a problem for you, then you really shouldn't be releasing your software as open source.  But you have no grounds to complain that other people choose to.<p>So why do people release software as open source?<p>- Fun.  It can be nice to say, ""Here, look what I did!""  Why not give it away for free?<p>- Learning.  Participating in open source software is a good way to get feedback from experienced developers you could never learn from otherwise.<p>- Marketing.  At the worst, you wind up with software to show people that has your name on it.  At its best, an individual will wind up with a network of connections who can get you jobs that you like.  Then for companies you get into dual licensing business models, ease of attracting developers, etc.<p>- Gratitude.  A lot of developers gained a tremendous amount from using and reading other people's open source software, and feel like they are paying that gift forward.<p>- License requirement.  Some open source software is only available under licenses that say you cannot restrict redistribution of your changes.  (The GPL is an example.)  Thus you can find that you can get a lot of what you're looking for already done, and the cost is reciprocity.  (Hey, if you don't like the license, don't use the software...)<p>- Maintenance costs.  Many companies find that they need something ""almost the same as"" something out there.  But maintaining a fork over time gets expensive as you have to track future improvements, security advisories, and so on.  But if you contribute your changes back into the project, then you avoid this cost.  (Supporters of the BSD license prefer motivating people this way.)<p>- Reducing the price of complements.  Customers often want to buy a solution, and have a price they are willing to pay.  That solution will include multiple pieces of software.  If you make other pieces of software cost less, then your piece can cost more.  As a concrete example, for many years Oracle pushed customers towards Linux, and then charged a higher price to run on Linux than to run on Solaris.<p>...and so on and so forth.  There are many valid reasons to give away open source software for everyone from individual hobbyists to big companies.  But the fact that there are lots of reasons that lots of other people want to do it doesn't mean that it makes sense for you.  If it doesn't make sense for you, then don't do it.  But don't try to tell everyone else that they shouldn't do what they want to do for their own reasons..",1361515996

I seem to recall a project started by ... oh was it ... I believe it was someone from Finland ...<p>Anyway, I think this misses the spirit of the community. There's also this idea that I've heard Joel Spolsky talk about, such as once you introduce money, you change the situation drastically. Imagine an kernel module programmer building the module for the usual reasons, now say someone provided the programmer a method to pay some trivial amounts, like $5 or $10 ... Now, you introduce a very small amount of money and it can give the programmer a feeling of ""this is a waste of time"" because, say, someone working at MS doing a similar job is making much more money doing basically the same thing.  This is not to say the programmer doesn't deserve or that making $20 is not better than $0 but it changes the dynamic in an odd way.",1361515831

The refresh process in Play is also a lot better than a JRebel-based solution or something similar, because in case of compilation errors Play generates a nice error page.<p>The refresh speed may indeed be annoying and could be better, but it's less of an issue with Play than in Rails or Django or whatever, because you're working with a static language and while writing code you feel less of a need to see what your new lines of code produce. In Scala, if you're using it as a functional language, all the code you write tends to be correct if it compiles and Play itself uses many functional idioms making it very suitable for a functional style.<p>It's worth noting what Play gives you when compared to Rails, Django and the like.<p>Remember that Rap Genius article from a few days ago, in which people complained about Heroku's Bamboo stack and having to work with over 70 Heroku dynos? I have a Scala module on top of Heroku that's processing 25,000 requests per second in under 100ms per request and that's running with just 8 Heroku dynos. And I'm actually dissatisfied because a high-CPU server on top of EC2 would be able to handle all 25K.<p>With Play you get the best of both worlds. A productive framework and the full power of the JVM. It's not easy to describe how it <i>feels</i> to get this combination, but it feels great, trust me.",1361515789

It wasn't until I could finally afford a computer of my own that I found out there's a drive mechanism inside  this little thing that spins around.

That has nothing whatsoever to do with me not being able to fish without a license.  I should be able to fish any time I want without having to have a license as a prerequisite.<p>Now, we can debate ideas on how to prevent over-fishing and over-hunting.  And that's OK.  I am all for that.  I won't put forth any proposals here because it is a complex subject.  Licenses don't stop over-fishing.  I've seen people take fish species, sizes and quantities that they are not supposed to.<p>See, here's the difference.  I firmly believe that people --outside of extreme circumstances-- are good, not evil.  For me at least, published guidance on such things as what species, sized and quantities to take would be enough.  I don't need a law and a guy with a uniform and a gun to make me abide by reasonably justified social guidelines.  Maybe some people do.  I think most don't.

There is a very heavy anti-LaTeX movement that I occasionally run into.  There are also a lot of people who use it and would not recommend anything else.<p>> My argument against ""give it another 10-20 years"" is that LaTeX has already been around forever. I know people even in math, physics, and CS that never use LaTeX (in favor of Word). Which I find silly and strange, but it is what it is.<p>This is very true.  And what I find more annoying is the argument that we need to move to DocBook because somehow that's more accessible (and yet it isn't either as accessible or as powerful).<p>There are a few things that hurt LaTeX adoption in some environments though and I want to mention here.  These are generally from my experiences participating on various TeXLive-related email lists.<p>There is an expectation at least in the XeTeX community from what I have seen that everyone will manually upgrade to the latest and greatest quickly.  With many of the TeX distribution, there isn't a lot of thought given to long-term support.  This makes things like running hosted services for mission critical apps which use LaTeX somewhat problematic.<p>I ran into the dreaded ""we can't start because you are using something 7 years old"" message and the only help I could get was ""upgrade.""  Not helpful when trying to package software that people are running on production services.  Not helpful at all.<p>I will follow up with you on email (from my personal account, chris.travers@gmail.com).  I think that one of the things that LaTeX really needs to get wider support is a set of community resources for longer-term support, for people who are happy to accept workarounds if it means being able to support earlier versions etc.<p>I am in the process of trying to get a hosting service up for LedgerSMB and we use LaTeX for a lot of stuff internally (the hosting solution will use XeTeX).  I think a rising tide here would help both us and the community out.<p>> Of course, I'm hoping that new online editors like SpanDeX.io and LaTeXTemplates are the adrenaline shot that LaTeX needs for wider adoption.<p>I think it may help.

[1]<p>It's also possible to write complex software and not be vulnerable, though 99.999% of the time companies (start-ups and otherwise) seem more concerned with an MVP and new features than security. If you design a system from the ground up with security as a core feature, then you have a CHANCE of having a system that won't be vulnerable to script kiddies every other week. On top of that you need to be sure to protect against social engineering, but that's another discussion.<p>I don't even know if it's possible to use something like Rails (or Ruby, even) and be secure for the long term without having to deal with constant updates and patches. On the other hand, I HAVE used complex systems that were designed from the ground up to be secure and that simply NEVER turned out to have a security vulnerability after the first few releases. (Anything by DJB, for example. [2] Some of those tools have gone 15+ years with no vulnerabilities. Compare the constant sendmail or bind security exploits, numbering in the hundreds at this point, to DJB's qmail and djbdns.)<p>Until it's a priority, it's always going to be an afterthought, by definition. People will use Rails or the framework du jour, despite the fact that such frameworks are designed with the same ""get it done and release ASAP"" philosophy that most commercial sites are developed with, and then everyone wonders at security holes.

Another cop came out of the booth.  He, menacingly, looked inside the car were my Mom, Sister and I were.  The first cop asked my Dad to get out of the car.  They walked around the car looking for problems.  The car was perfect.  Then he said something like ""We need to go in the office for you to pay your fine"".  I'm sure my Dad though ""WTF, over?"".  He, politely, asked:  ""What's the problem officer"".  Without blinking the copy replied:  ""You were driving with one hand"".<p>They went inside and my Dad, effectively, had to bribe them.

5263008,comment,5262120,5262664,1,0,shredfvz,,,"> The thing that makes bitcoin different than other online payment systems or virtual currencies is that it's distributed. That property, however, is also what makes it difficult to use.<p>This to me highlights just about everything there is to know about Bitcoin. People are too easily turned off by the amount of effort it takes to properly command a Bitcoin wallet. At least with the traditional banking system, a big bank is there to lend you a hand should you need anything or should something go wrong with one of your transactions.<p>But there's a big tradeoff: when you utilize the traditional banking system, you must entrust at least some of your wealth to an entity you have absolutely zero control over.<p>Right now that's fine, but personally I like the idea of keeping external dependencies to a minimum, especially when it comes to money.<p>The price of Bitcoin remains affordable for now, and will continue to do so as long as people don't have a compelling reason to get off their behinds. For some perspective, the Bitcoin market cap is  $332M. At a $1000M ($1B) market cap and ~12.8M BTC in circulation, the price per Bitcoin would be roughly $78. At a $10B market cap it would be $780. The market cap of Facebook is $68.7B. When you compare a global financial system with censorship resistant properties (Bitcoin), and give it a valuation six times less than a global social network (Facebook), 1 BTC is still worth $780. If Bitcoin is 60X less valuable to the world than Facebook, it's $78/coin. 120X less valuable and it's $39/coin. Meaning if Bitcoin truly provides the world less than 1% of the value of Facebook then it's still undervalued at $30.<p>IMO the world is practically crying out for an alternative financial system free from high risk banking, but I digress. Average people will not actively seek any competing financial system Bitcoin included until they have a compelling motivation eating away at them 24/7. There are scenarios which could create those circumstances, but they're long shots that hinge upon various social, economic and political factors at some vague point in the distant future. I can at least see Bitcoin having a $1B market cap for now, but for BTC to really come into its own, average people will need to get off their behinds. In other words, don't count on it.<p>Still the market cap of Apple is $450+ billion, and I'd like to think a global Internet currency/financial system is worth at least 10% of that to our society.",1361513673

It's not like the mobile app store ecosystem.<p>Successful projects, in terms of numbers of users and contributors, seem to happen in places where many people need something complex and pool their resources to all share in a better solution than any individual one could have been.<p>Putting the whole thing under economic norms, and encouraging communities to think in those terms is probably extraordinarily counter productive. There isn't enough money available to pay open source developers what they are worth in dollars. If open source operated under economic norms it wouldn't work, since it operates under social norms it does [1]. There <i>is</i> a reason that everyone here doesn't get paid to work on whatever cool fun they feel like working on.<p>A ""type 0"" project is a hobby project and your github account isn't there to get you paid. Open sourcing it is socially acceptable public charitable giving crossed with academic publishing.<p>The next step isn't consulting monetization models or aquisition/IPO. The next step is more contributors so that a team of motivated people can solve a complex problem, for everyone, once and for all (that's the ideal version anyway, about as likely as an IPO or aquisition). That might bring some money, maybe for some core peole but more important is that now everyone else, and especially those that contributed and have expertise, can go on and build/do that thing that this complex problem was stopping them from doing.<p>Looking at this as an progression from github project to aquisition and defining the stage of a project by revenue misses nearly every lesson learned from watching this strange new market succeed so spectacularly entirely because it is based on different norms and therefore attacks different problems.<p>[1] <a href=""http://youtu.be/OdjlOgGVRVA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/OdjlOgGVRVA</a>",1361513035

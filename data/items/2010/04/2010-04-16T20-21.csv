I want to say that it would be just as bad to obsess over intent without worrying about act, but I'm not sure that's true.<p>Even in the cases presented (accidentally posting a nude photo and arresting someone who had not committed a crime), the crime is still not just in the act itself. The crime is also in the negligence involved. A negligent police officer should be punished even if no one is mistakenly arrested. If someone negligently handles nude photos (I'm not sure why you'd have them in the first place, but let's leave that aside for now), they should be punished even if the photos don't get leaked.<p>If social security numbers are leaked on a public website, those responsible should be punished <i>even if no one loaded the page</i>. If, however, a company is absolutely devoted to security but someone still breaks in and steals social security numbers, the company's punishment should be less, even though the act (social security numbers falling into the wrong hands) is less bad than the negligent company's act (social security numbers being mishandled but never falling into the wrong hands). I'd rather my social security number wasn't leaked, but I'd place greater trust in a company which handled it correctly and still got broken into than one that handled it recklessly but got lucky.<p>Really, I think that's the point I want to make above all: Luck should have no bearing on the law.",1271451143

1271877,comment,1270842,1271532,0,0,akeefer,,,"It's a personal taste thing, honestly.  Language features aren't free to users:  as a user, you need to understand the behavior, so if there are two possible behaviors that's something else to learn.<p>There are two different use cases here:  lambdas (which may be true closures) and user-defined control constructs.  In the first case, I'd argue that you want the declaration semantics to be as close as possible to a normal function definition.  You should be defining a function, so return returns from that function, and break/continue statements can't have targets outside the function.  For control constructs, you want the code to appear as if its inline, so you want non-local return semantics.  I.e. you want it to behave as if it's not actually in a separate function at all.<p>So I think those are two different constructs, and things get confusing when you conflate the two.  At the very least if you want to have those two constructs, make them look different enough that users don't confuse them.  Java was going to go the wrong way there on their initial closure proposal (the => versus ==> thing) and make things that look like lambdas behave like in-line statements.  Ruby kind of goes the other way and makes everything look like a bunch of statements within the body of something else in contexts (like the reduce() method) where what you really want or would expect is a lambda.  If I write ""return x + y"" in the body of my argument to reduce(), I expect that to be the value of the reducer function, not to exit the function that was calling reduce().  But at least in Ruby a block is always a block and always has the same semantics, even if those semantics seem inappropriate for many use cases.<p>But again, it's personal taste as to which of those, or both, you want to add to a language.  In my personal opinion user-defined control statements aren't all that useful and you can fill most of the needs with language-defined control constructs.  But it's a tradeoff the language designer has to make, and there's no one right path.",1271450542

This was a fundamental change in the 80's where Goldman, Morgan Stanley, and many others where they became officially owned by the public. That ment that the risk of all their losses was owned by the shareholders as well as profits. Risky investing became the norm, because if you lost a ton of money for Goldman, you may have gotten chewed out or lost your job.

Maybe Stephanopoulos isn't the direction that Andrew wants to go, but he should look to people he emulates and try to find what he can do better to be more like them.<p>A large part of that is choosing your personal style. The Mixergy style works fairly well so far, but there's always room to adjust as you mature, and as the program ages-<p>For instance, Andrew could pursue a Folksy, relaxed, conversational style, interacting a lot with the audience. This is a lot of fun, and helps us feel connected with him, almost indie rock bandishly.<p>Another direction would to bring things to a more ""professional"" level, more akin to Bloomberg news with a focus on young and ambitious starts, rather than the megacorps we see so dominating the media.<p>A third option, and the one I'd reccomend, is to go for more of a Biographical view. Aim for Timelessness.<p>When I visit Folklore.org and read about the creation of the original Mac, I'm transported back 30 years. The stories about Atkinson and Jobs are classic and it doesn't matter WHEN I watch or listen to these stories, they'll always be wonderful.<p>We say good examples of this during the SmugMug interview. These stories work well now, or 5 years from now.<p>Discussions of current events, such as the iPad and the re-launch of StackExchange are interesting, but don't have nearly the same level of timelessness.<p>Particularly since Mixergy makes it money by selling back-archives, try to make sure they're valueable into the future.<p>Think A&E's Biography, not CNN Headline news.<p>In any events, Thanks for doing the interviews, they are an interesting contribution to the world of Startup Culture.",1271449658

Because it's written in a language I loathe, and the API is workmanlike but completely uninspired (disclaimer: I've never written any code for it). In contrast, the Cocoa Touch APIs are delightful, and MIT-style (vs. New Jersey) at most levels. Perfect? No. Amazingly crafted? Yes.<p>I claim the secret sauce to their APIs is actually a character at Apple named Ali Ozer who, along with his crew, has maintained a firm hand on the tiller, and learned a huge amount about object-oriented design for interactive systems over the past couple of decades.<p>iPhone OS is the result of throwing out a lot of the cruft and starting over, but keeping the hard-earned knowledge. (Core Animation being one of the key underlying technologies for iPhone OS that found its way back to the desktop, but only partially due to all the cruft in normal desktop Cocoa.)<p>And Apple works hard at the silicon-to-UI whole-stack integration and performance tuning, something that other vendors famously haven't been able to do (because they don't control the whole stack), or haven't wanted to do.

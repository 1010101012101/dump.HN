2516569,comment,2515679,2516303,2,0,mprovost,,,"I was referring to data compression not the size of the screen. A Blu-Ray is about 1% of the size of an uncompressed HD film. Of course if you're seeing a digital copy in the cinema it's been compressed down already so a Blu-Ray is about 13% of that. But a Blu-Ray is a tiny amount of data compared to what you see on film. So if you're already prepared to live with that, does tweaking a setting on your TV make that much of a difference to the average consumer? How much of a difference does it make?",1304582311

I believe most brand managers would reach the same conclusion, especially if the costs were low.<p>Furthermore, does the track record not show that Microsoft re-brands (assimilates) its acquisitions eventually?

Obviously I have some additional technology secret sauce or there wouldn't be a project in it to satisfy university requirements.<p>To me the main failing of conventional tipjars is the requirement to manually tip the recipient. To my eyes Tipjoy was the first real twist on this -- that you could commit to tip before paying -- but otherwise it was the same as Flattr and the dozens of others that have come and gone in this space. Flattr's twist is OK, but I think imposes even more potential cognitive overhead in terms of ""I really like this site, I need to find more articles to flattr"".<p>I think that the Contenture / Readability / my-company-name-here model works better because it requires no thought on the part of the customer. Payments are divvied up automatically. No transaction cost (""Do I tip or not?"") is imposed on the user.<p>Mind you, my most imposing business obstacle is getting a merchant account.

  (10^(5+6))^(1/2) # simplify inner product
  (10^11)^(1/2) # more simplify

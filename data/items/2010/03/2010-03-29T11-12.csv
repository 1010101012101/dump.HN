The American media are largely co-opted, and their few remaining vestiges of real investigative journalism are crippled by financial constraints...<p>The need for independent leaks and whistle-blowing exposures is particularly acute now because, at exactly the same time that investigative journalism has collapsed, public and private efforts to manipulate public opinion have proliferated.  This is exemplified by the type of public opinion management campaign detailed by the above-referenced CIA Report, the Pentagon's TV propaganda program exposed in 2008, and the ways in which private interests covertly pay and control supposedly ""independent political commentators"" to participate in our public debates and shape public opinion.""",1269863918

We make too many things secret, and a government with so much secrecy is not responsive to its citizens.<p>Having said that, I also support the idea that some things -- some very few things -- should be kept secret.<p>Wikileaks does not seem to discriminate between these things.<p>Therefore I cannot in good conscience support Wikileaks with their mission to make everything they find public. If, as the article indicates, they're in it for personal kicks then that makes it all the worse.<p>It's 2010. You'd think the average person/whistleblower would have enough ability to self-publish for the entire world to see, right?

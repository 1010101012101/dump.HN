As for information, most people will now use convenient smartphone apps to navigate BART, and she will only handle the few people who don&#x27;t --tourists or people unwilling to use smartphones.<p>2) She was a terrible example in that you <i>cannot</i> automate her, since she is precisely what is left after the automation of her job. The work that comes to her is what did not fall into the automated use cases.<p>The value of some jobs is the human contact, or human interface they provide, and she falls into this category. This is also why we won&#x27;t automate, say, barmen, or waitresses.<p>But what CAN be automated about BART, are train drivers (absolutely unnecessary in our day and age), and train dispatchers.

We don&#x27;t have to worry about algorithms all that much - we may just write an SQL query which takes care of things for us. One of the more complex things we do in new code is maybe two levels of $order, the equivalent of your for x in y loop.<p>We&#x27;re programming on a level quite a bit higher than C, nor are we exposed to the sheer verbosity of Java, thank god. You think Cach ObjectScript is awful? I think Java is awful.<p>What Cach gives us is tight integration between the language and the database system, so in that way the choice isn&#x27;t really between Cach ObjectScript and Python, it&#x27;s more between PL/pgsql or PL/Python and Cach ObjectScript. Once you go there you&#x27;ll realise that the code that&#x27;s written in ObjectScript isn&#x27;t really affected that much by the choice of programming language anyway. And PL/Python isn&#x27;t really something you&#x27;d want to write a production system in anyway. Between that and built-in ORM, things really aren&#x27;t that bad.<p>And 100x readability improvement is just wrong. Sorry, it is. Sure, that may apply to some old MUMPS code that survived the 70s when disk space was sparse but even this is fairly straightforward to expand into something quite readable. We do have syntax highlighting, function calls look the same, and assigning a value to an object is &#x27;set object.Property = &quot;blah&quot;&#x27; instead of &#x27;object.Property = &quot;blah&quot;&#x27;, a difference that&#x27;s quite trivial.<p>That&#x27;s not to say the lack of libraries isn&#x27;t annoying, but everything really important is there in the right places. I&#x27;ve written a decompressor for tar.gz in about 34 quite readable lines, with error handling and all. gzip is built in these days so it&#x27;s really mostly .tar I needed to worry about.

It was easy enough to do.<p>And it&#x27;s a pretty top-notch fast SQL implementation with a nice built-in language and a nice ORM and lots of other bonuses like full-text search and bitmap indices and OLAP cubes (yes, it speaks MDX even) if nothing else.",1378085252

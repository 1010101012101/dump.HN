This <i>might</i> be one of those times, and you <i>might</i> be able to become the next captains of industry.  But then again, <i>any</i> time might be one of those times.  The statement isn't predictive.<p>I think the article went off the tracks when it theorized that <i>now</i> is one of those times, based only on the observations that Rockefeller et al. got rich when they were young, which also happened to be during a time of great economic turbulence.  So I suppose the logic is that since the economy is currently screwed, and since there are currently 20-year-olds working hard somewhere on a business, this is the time when we're going to produce the next Rockefeller.  QED, right?<p>My point is only that Gladwell's thesis revolves around the central role of <i>chance</i> in success, and this article seems to want to take his examples, and torture them into some kind of prediction about the future.  I think that's a bit silly.",1226896508

The reason I think many corporate backed ventures in this this area flounder is because they lack the start-up mentality.  They start out with a set of expectations and are usually unwilling to experiment or be flexible.  CEO Jason Kilar has done a great job convincing NBC (and others) to make their content available in an unprecedented format.  He is probably the largest reason for their success.  He is the reason Hulu rivals sites like Sidereel.",1226896027

I would assume that the cost of a used MacBook or Mac mini would end up being more cost-effective in the long run than finding any other way to develop apps for the iPhone in terms of the time it will consume. For what it's worth, I have some friends who bought a Mac expressly for iPhone development but when they're not doing that, they use their prior computers and run Windows in bootcamp. If you are really dead set on not buying a Mac, then <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/11/11/developer-creates-app-store-game-on-windows"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/11/11/develop...</a><p>There is also osx86, but if you run into any problems either with the above suggestion or a hacked version of OS X to run on non-apple hardware, you're pretty much screwed, especially if it doesn't happen on ""legit"" installs. Apple won't support it (you do get a couple of opportunities to get code-level help from apple engineers with the iPhone dev program), and neither will most people you encounter on forums/mailing lists due to all the little complexities of running an OS on unsupported hardware.<p>Lastly, what's up with the ""trendy""? I just use whatever works for what I need. For the iPhone, that is a mac. Getting a mac for iPhone development only makes me trendy in being an iPhone developer, but still I'd be getting it because I needed it. There is no shame in that :)",1226895815

He writes that the iron gets oxidized in the process, so some sort of reducing reaction with the pollutant, where the iron grabs the oxygen?<p>Doesn't make sense though, because the water is full of much easier to react free oxygen. Doesn't make sense in many other ways as well.<p>Maybe when he says the iron gets oxidized he means it reacts with the pollutant? But that doesn't make sense either because I don't think iron really reacts much with phosphorous or nitrogen.<p>So, is this fake or am I missing something large?<p>Edit: This seems relevant for some reason: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_of_nitro_compounds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_of_nitro_compounds</a><p>Anyone have more info?",1226895719

That sounds great to me, and I think I'd much prefer baby talk over the geeky alternatives.<p>Only one person on our eight-person team has kids. As for the others, I'm not sure if some of them have ever been on a date. Dealing with frustrated young men is... frustrating in and of itself. I'd just like to see some more balance and worldliness from my coworkers.<p>Despite the lack of other women, I have been lucky to be in a pretty egalitarian workplace. I generally feel respected, and many of our executives are women. That said, I <i>have</i> had less than tactful coworkers take a two minute break near my desk to stare at my chest and stuff snacks in their face, like it was some kind of show. That was fun.

If by &quot;controversial&quot; you mean &quot;less expressive&quot; or &quot;less composable&quot; then those controversies should disappear already.<p>For example: <a href=\"http://www.schemeworkshop.org/2011/papers/Barzilay2011.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.schemeworkshop.org/2011/papers/Barzilay2011.pdf</a> <a href=\"http://blog.racket-lang.org/2011/04/writing-syntax-case-macros.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.racket-lang.org/2011/04/writing-syntax-case-macr...</a><p>Related: <a href=\"http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/</a><p>On a side note, it&#x27;s impressive that language implementors write such a large amount of papers for almost all new language features. Compare it to the usual one-line point in changelog. This makes Racket foundations <i>incredibly</i> solid and learning it <i>in depth</i> easy and satisfying.",1386417237

Realistically, you could do that for all the basic combinations of user selections since there are relatively few of them and then patch in the advanced customizations at download time if needed. (Although mkisofs is pretty cheap to run, so  depending on your platform you could probably get away with no pregeneration.)<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to see a distribution offer Razor-qt as the default desktop -- I&#x27;m looking forward to what comes out of Razor-qt&#x27;s collaboration (merger) with LXDE.<p>A few similar services:<p>* Slax (a Slackware-based live CD Linux distribution) offers a build service where you can select individual packages (<a href=\"http://old.slax.org/build.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://old.slax.org/build.php</a>). I&#x27;m not sure if it has been deprecated for good with the new version of Slax being developed but it still works. Edit: From how it works it looks like Porteus was forked from Slax. I can&#x27;t access their website proper right now but googling around confirms this.<p>* SUSE Studio (<a href=\"http://susestudio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://susestudio.com/</a>) generates highly customizable live media images and VMs of openSUSE. Their gallery (<a href=\"http://susestudio.com/browse\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://susestudio.com/browse</a>) is a nice feature. It requires registration.<p>Edit: I mistakingly wrote that Razor-qt is merging with XFCE rather than LXDE. Fixed.<p>Edit 2: While it&#x27;s not strong evidence their download links (i.e., <a href=\"http://build.porteus.org/dl/$HASH/Porteus-RAZOR-v2.1-(i486|x86_64).iso\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://build.porteus.org/dl/$HASH/Porteus-RAZOR-v2.1-(i486|x...</a>) suggest  they don&#x27;t pregenerate ISOs but they may cache them.",1386416959

My point is that human nature seems to be very much correlated to capitalism.<p>And the important question is whether this is a fundamental characteristic of life, or is it just a feature of this particular version of intelligent life that we have in planet Earth? Or maybe is just a consequence of the evolution of our social system?<p>To state it clearly: is it possible to conceive an intelligent society collaborating by other means than the ones that we are currently using?

In Common Lisp, you just write some reader macros and that&#x27;s it[1]. If Python stopped being maintained, it would lag behind other languages, but the fact that the Common Lisp spec hasn&#x27;t been updated since 1996 doesn&#x27;t make it any less modern.<p>A more relevant example: Lisp doesn&#x27;t have hash table literals, which every &quot;modern&quot; language these days has, but those can also be added, trivially in less than fifty lines[2] of CL code, and suddenly Common Lisp is modern again.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://github.com/arielnetworks/cl-annot\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/arielnetworks/cl-annot</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"http://frank.kank.net/essays/hash.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://frank.kank.net/essays/hash.html</a>",1386416572

If you have a single plant system, you can just replace the nutrient solution every other week, like for like.  If you have different types of plant growing together, you need to be a bit more careful with monitoring your NPK levels.<p>Then there&#x27;s the basic maintenance that you&#x27;d have to do, regardless of plant type.  Like rinsing the nutrient residue from the substrate every couple of weeks to prevent toxic buildup.  Not particularly difficult, just drain the solution, pour water over the substrate to rinse, then add new solution.<p>But it&#x27;s a new office maintenance task that would have to be done, and I can imagine things getting forgotten/skipped.  If you like the idea of taking care of your own desk, then it&#x27;s not particularly difficult.  I&#x27;d be more worried in a medium office filled with these though; a small office is easy to take care of a desk or two, and a large office can afford to have a dedicated maintenance job, but a medium office is likely to be stuck with an awkward workload.",1386416137

The trick is to write X number of words each day, on different subjects, and reflect on what went right and what went wrong. It&#x27;s variety combined with reflection that makes it work.",1386414159

In South Africa, we&#x27;re talking on a totally different level. I advise you do some reading on the extent on racial inequality in SA before trying to draw comparisons. You can start here: <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=qVocM3aPKaQ%3D&tabid=838&mid=2364\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=qVocM3...</a><p>You&#x27;re talking about getting into universities, the gap between black and white primary and high school education is massive, just to get the basic requirements for university entrance is a struggle if you come from a rural town and do not speak first language English.<p>Do not compare the US and South Africa. There is no comparison. BEE may be unjust (I don&#x27;t think it is), but the scale of inequality in South Africa is overwhelming. Remember that over 85% of the population is non-white. I&#x27;m not sure how exactly what you say applies in a SA context, but income-based affirmative action sounds no different from race-based affirmative action in SA. I can put forward more relevant scenarios than the one you mention, I know numerous white people, both from poor and rich backgrounds, who have successfully gotten jobs. They are qualified. The same applies to black people. The unemployed people I know are simply not qualified, regardless of their race.",1386414038

There are a lot of cultures where there are many people who are used to the chaperone role.  I think (albeit, with a bit of effort) you'd be able to find someone willing to spend 3 or 4 months hanging out in San Francisco on an unconventional but free vacation.  Just offer them a sizable reward if they catch you.  (There is even a fetishist scene from which you can acquire working chastity belts!)<p>Alternatively, just hire a ""virtual personal assistant"" to video chat with you once per hour and also go over a once per minute time-lapse film of you sleeping every day.  IR sensitive webcams and IR LED lamps are pretty cheap.  Even better, you can trade a favor with someone who handles the tech for the house arrest ankle bracelets.<p>Granted, none of this is foolproof.  You're probably smart enough to circumvent any of these measures, but you'd have to make an active effort to do so.  This takes an affair well out of the realm of circumstantial ""temptation.""  (Though in your case, given your unusually poor impulse control, the temptation might increase because of the measures.)<p>EDIT: This gives me an idea for a product.

Anyone who succeeds in anything, there’s always going to be people who don’t have the courage to do that. They get upset about it, either explain it away, or dismiss it away.<p>JS: It sounds like you almost found out by accident. In Assholes Finish First you say that when you and your friends graduated from law school, “We were slowly realizing that the ‘real life’ we’d chosen really fucking sucked. A lot.” Sounds like you’re trying to tell people how not to do that.<p>TM: As much as I’d like to sit here and be like, “Yeah, I had the courage to do all this stuff, and I had the vision to see where I was gonna go and I knew I would get there.” That’s fuckin’ bullshit. That’s not true. That’s the narrative I might tell when I’m 70, and I can’t remember all this stuff.<p>JS: Trying to inspire your grandkids?<p>TM: Right. The true, true story is it’s a combination of some determination and some talent on my part. Some talent, a lot of determination, a lot of luck, and a lot of serendipity. And a lot of failure. I was fired—<p>JS: There’s a section about failure in the book.<p>TM: I was fired from the legal profession, basically. I wasn’t just fired from Fenwick and West—you read the first book, the story’s in there. I got fired in such a public way that there was almost no way I was going to get back into law. I would have to go back and be a public defender or something if I wanted to be a lawyer. Seriously.",1287981205

1828477,comment,1827893,1827893,0,0,scottygrom,,,"Interesting idea. Congrats on building it. Think about what problem are you trying to solve? Perhaps users don't even know they have this problem until you make some something routine today 10x or 100x easier or more fun...or your service provides an entirely new way for people to communicate/connect.<p>Why would you yourself use this? Some use cases that might be relevant:<p>1) Personal notes. Record voice message on your phone and press a button to store online without the friction of dialing a number. Make it trivial to retrieve, organize and  share your voice notes online.<p>2) Group broadcast. Make it faster and easier than group texting, especially for detailed information. Record something e.g., change of plans, post to a URL with one click and broadcast URL to recipients in your contact list.<p>The latter use case might be really useful for people who don't like to text...granted not your typical HN reader. Think about who might be well served by voice features with SUPER simple user experience.<p>Also think about non-consumer use cases too...how could companies better disseminate detailed information to employees for example? Which, if any, of these scenarios make more sense with voice features versus simply posting info online?<p>Solve a real problem first and make customers happy. Then think about how to charge for the value you offer. Have fun, good luck!",1287979667

1828474,comment,1827294,1828376,0,0,lsc,,,"well, the phenomena of using bugzilla and other web based bug tracking systems is a fairly recent one.   And certainly if they are posting good stuff, it doesn't really matter if they are posting good stuff on a mailing list or on a bugzilla or what have you.   I'm just making a historical observation that the people who have been around a while tend to use mailing lists.<p>but yeah, I do think there is something a little fishy about a SysAdmin who doesn't have any public evidence of collaboration.   I mean, sure, they could be really good and just have worked places that don't let you give your changes back, but eh, you can say that about any other metric.    You must have added a feature to something at some point.    You must have been the first user to find a particular bug at some point.<p>The biggest problem with this metric is that search kind of sucks for mailing lists.  I mean, usenet used to be /the place/  for this sort of thing, but usenet is dead, and as far as I can tell, much of the usenet archives that at one point I could access via dejanews are gone (groups.google does not have some of the posts that I know are there.)",1287979547

Calling Twitter digg's true nemesis is so far out of it is not even funny. Twitter and Digg could coexist for ever. how can I get a real discussion of a link of twitter? It would be really hard for me to see the diverse amount of links that digg and reddit give me just by amassing a ton of friends. Most of the best links I've found on digg/reddit aren't even from people I would have know. They are not usually famous or popular outside those sites. Digg's error was shifting away from this and trying to go towards twitter's way of following a select group of people. That obviously is not what people want. Reddit does it by subjects, that seems to be working great.",1287979501

It's unique to the login process, so one compromised account isn't able to lead to compromising other websites.  It's also time sensitive (generally) and so that hijacked cookie will expire.

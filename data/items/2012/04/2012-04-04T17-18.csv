Outside of abstinence, which cannot be proved or disproved by anyone other than the female in question (and it is not even something she has 100% control on -- unwanted sex do happen in this world), there is no foolproof birth control method.  As such, and without trampling on employees' privacy, there's no point for an employer to inquiring about procreation plan.<p>I don't believe the clauses contingent on pregnancy is appropriate on employment contracts neither.  If maternity leave is such a big loss on productivity that a company needs compensation for, one can argue either the market should already have a product for it (e.g. some form of ""maternity insurance"" provided to employers), or the government should subsidize the employer.<p>In Canada, where @raganwald and I currently reside, employers are not legally required to provide compensation for persons on maternity or parental leave.  (Maternity leave is for mothers giving birth only; parental leave can be split between parents of either birth or adoption.)  Instead, the government provides partial compensation.  It's up to the employer to decide whether to provide additional compensation on top of government benefits.  I don't know where you are located nor your local laws regarding maternity leave.  In your opinion, would a policy similar to Canada's be suffice, or do you still want more protection for the employers?<p>I suppose you are opposed to Arizona's new birth control pill bill HB2625 then?

It enabled the US to ship dollars by the trillions (costing pennies to print) oversees in exchange for wealth from other countries, which was used to build our economic might.  And, in exchange for those dollars the US shipped, it received tremendous amount of wealth for ZERO INTEREST.  There is no cheaper way for a country to finance its growth than to print currency and ship it abroad, because those who hold the currency are not expecting a return for their ""investment"".<p>Now, the 21st century is clearly becoming the century of electronic commerce, however we are still using the currency of the previous generation.  If the Federal Reserve issued an electronic US Dollar that could be traded like BitCoin, but backed by the Fed and exchanged for real US dollars, it would become the bedrock of the electronic commerce overnight.    People all over the world would be able to trade it, exchange it electronically, and settle with their bank in exchange for the printed equivalent.   I can imagine the sheer volume of wealth that will flow into the US in exchange for the US-backed electronic currency.<p>It will not only result in more efficiency in the online commerce at home and oversees, but also create new industries overnight.    This one step has the potential of taking the US out of the current recession overnight, and substantially offsetting the national debt.<p>Of course, many issues would have to be ironed out, particularly around security.  But, considering how secure BitCoin is without central governance, I am convinced that none of the technical challenges will be insurmountable, because all transactions will have to be verified.<p>I think sooner or alter one country's currency will become the defacto electronic currency for global commerce.  The question is will it be the US, Canada, or some other country?<p>Sandro G

I dunno. I'm just really sick of near-misses with idiots who are texting while driving.<p>I'm not convinced that it's generally a good idea to outsource responsibility for safety to external devices, but if you're going to do it, in this case, it may be more reasonable to put the constraint in the phone rather than the car.  It should be relatively trivial to restrict text entry when moving at high speeds on a phone with embedded GPS, and doing so would alter the behavior of the thing causing the distraction rather than the thing you want drivers to pay attention to.",1333561685

Even if one side of the equation wobbles a little, Groupon will feel the impact. I think at this stage, Groupon is fighting a dual (losing) battle:<p>1) Merchants perception of the whole daily deal market is very negative. Repeat business is quite low and it mainly attracts the spendthrifts who are looking for a deal. Given the margins that most local businesses have, running a daily deal means taking a hit on those margins.<p>2) From a consumer perspective, the novelty of the daily deals market has really worn off. Consumer fatigue has set in and more and more people are tired of having their inboxes flooded with emails. Personalization is still a joke and ticks people off even further.<p>It wont be long before the whole local deal market implodes (think of it -- the 2nd largest player - LivingSocial is not yet profitable). Groupon is well aware of this and so is trying to ramp up its technology platform via acquisitions to eventually evolve into something more.

This sentence sounds like it is describing Amazon.com, constantly inventing new services:<p>""A few companies have proven themselves adept at inventing new markets, quickly entering emerging markets, and dramatically shifting patterns of customer choice in established markets.""<p>When CEOs have no idea what a company should do in the long-term, they claim that the company is going to focus ""our efforts on our core businesses"".

3798640,comment,3795513,3796551,1,0,gruseom,,,"Here's why I'm interested. The most important thing in making good software is to eschew unnecessary complexity. A program's size is the best measure of its complexity. Therefore we should try to write shorter programs. Much, much shorter programs. (See Alan Kay's VPRI project etc. etc.)<p>It's easy enough to measure the size of a program: LOC or something like it. But how do we define what a program <i>is</i>?  Surprisingly, that's not obvious. As you say, how one carves it up seems arbitrary. The conclusion you came to is also one I've come to: you end up having to measure the total size of <i>all</i> the code that's running. But that seems absurd. (Unless you're a Forth person.) It means I can't measure my program's size without measuring, say, Linux's.<p>So to stave off the apparently absurd, we need a simple way to distinguish programs or systems from one another. That's my question.<p>If A and B both call each other, surely they are part of the same system. But what if A calls B, but B doesn't know about A? Does that make them separate? Sometimes one would say yes, for example if B is Linux. Can we always say yes? That would be convenient. But there are lots of such As and Bs in any complex program. That doesn't mean there are lots of programs.<p>I wonder if like so many other things in programming, this is in the end a social question and not a technical one. That's the trouble with referring to ""reuse"": it depends on how many people know about B and like it well enough to use it. It seems weird to say that A (or the system it belongs to) gets less complex depending on how many other programs use B. That would mean that a system's codebase could get more or less complex without a line of its code actually changing. Again - not an impossible view, but seems absurd.<p>I'm looking for a principle here because this way of thinking about complexity is a big part of how I work and because I want to have an entire company that thinks this way.",1333560178

The understanding ""non-terminating"" here includes errors as well (the idea of bottom  that you'll find in some earlier texts on programming languages semantics, such as Allen's Anatomy of Lisp). Non-terminating computations are equivalent to paradoxes in formal logic (see Curry-Howard correspondence), and the first type system was developed to deal with Curry's paradox (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%27s_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%27s_paradox</a>) in the first programming language (lambda calculus).

Perhaps a few days of prototyping and proof-of-concept tests will narrow that down a bit, though: we'll do the work in three stages, likely to take 2-3 months, 2-3 months and 3-4 months respectively, putting us in a 7-10 month window. As each stage develops, the reliability of any estimate for remaining time tends to increase, and perhaps a clearer idea emerges for the later stages as well.<p>In short, an estimate isn't worth much without some indication of confidence attached to it.<p>FWIW, my personal preference is to aim for about four qualitative levels: very general magnitude from initial overview of the project, more systematic estimate after clarifying detailed requirements and probably a bit of prototyping or proof-of-concept work, definite target date unless unexpected major disruption or change of requirements happens, and very confident once the project is into the final stages and no major hurdles remain.",1333559959

Obvious red flags:
1. Heavy reliance on field sales (the largest expense), which is NOT scalable
2. Exclusive reliance on repeat sales as the key driver of sustainability: this being the obvious case, did Google not do its due diligence and actually surveyed past Groupon customers? Such a siimple survey would have easily revealed the issues of this ""local deals"" model. 
3. Heavy reliance on ""small business"" owners as the driver of revenue. This is a sensitive and fickle market, where even slight movements in the general economy will cause huge moves in spending patterns.<p>These 3 points were readily available to anybody with some insight into this segment; Google with all its money must be surrounded by ""yes"" men, nothing else could explain it's willingness to part with $6 billion so quickly.",1333559827

(You can give up this requirement if you want to give up one of the other qualities I mentioned above, but those are different papers ;)<p>1. An account holder looking to spend creates a coin through a mutual process with the bank, which debits their account. The bank is unaware of the identity of the coin, but knows that it conforms to certain properties.<p>2. The coin is comprised of multiple parts P_1 - P_n, each of which has two pieces, P_i_1 and P_i_2. The account identity is encoded in the coin such that it is recoverable if and only if one has <i>both</i> P_i_1 and P_i_2 for any <i>i</i>.<p>3. To spend, for all <i>i</i>, a merchant requests <i>either</i> P_i_1 <i>or</i> P_i_2. (most likely based on the merchant's identity).<p>4. The merchant eventually turns these coin parts over to the bank, which credits their account. If the bank sees multiple spends of the same coin, only then can it put two corresponding pieces together and deduce the account holder's identity.<p>There are of course many details that force the parties to behave honestly at every step. The paper is somewhat old and I have no idea of further work (I'm not especially interested in protocols that require a bank or user identities). Main point being that if you <i>do</i> have a bank, designing protocols becomes much easier (Simple blind-signature tokens, for instance. These are anonymous but require online transactions).",1333559157

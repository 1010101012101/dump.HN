8610880,comment,8610129,8610737,0,0,Xcelerate,,,"I have never found a good, simple analogy.  The best I&#x27;ve got is still a mathematical explanation, but I think it can make it &quot;click&quot; for some people:<p>You have two photon detectors that you can rotate; one is in New York and one is in Paris.  Two photons are entangled and one is sent to New York for measurement, and one is sent to Paris for measurement.  What you find is that while each photon&#x27;s polarization measurement is random, if you take the &quot;random&quot; values you get for both and compute their correlation over many trials, <i>this</i> value is a function of the difference in angles between the photon detector in New York and the photon detector in Paris.<p>But here&#x27;s the kicker: each photon detector can be rotated <i>while</i> the photons are in flight, before they get there.  So how is it that the correlation is a function of both photon detector angles then?  Especially considering it is light that you&#x27;re measuring, and nothing can travel faster than light.  That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called spooky action at a distance.<p>(Edit: Let me know if this makes any sense.  I&#x27;m in a continual search for the simplest explanation of this phenomenon.)",1416027541

In contrast, when you say that &quot;all components of a quantum system [that appears in nature] are always entangled&quot; then this is trivially true in a technical sense, but highly misleading.

8610868,comment,8610129,8610736,0,0,beloch,,,"It&#x27;s a very common misconception that entanglement allows faster than light communication.  It doesn&#x27;t.<p>Describing quantum phenomena with real world metaphors always breaks down if we carry things far enough. I&#x27;m going to use coin flipping as a metaphor to make a specific point, but don&#x27;t assume this metaphor will still work if you try to extend it.  To even begin to understand entanglement you really need to look at the math.  That being said, let&#x27;s proceed.<p><i>The Setup:</i> (this explains how the metaphor is being made, but you can skip to the payoff if you just want the what without any of the why).<p>We can think of a pair of entangled particles as a pair of coins.  If we flip each coin, we have a fifty/fifty odds of gettings heads or tails. This is what we normally think of, in the macroscopic world, as a random outcome (It&#x27;s not really, but let&#x27;s not go there).  An entangled pair of coins behaves very unusually.  The outcome of flipping one coin is related to the outcome of the other coin.  For example, if one coin comes up as heads, the other will <i>always</i> come up as tails, or vice-versa. Let&#x27;s say we separate the two coins by several light years and then flip them. The strange correlation will hold. For a non-Quantum particle there are several possible explanations for this behavior.  We might think that, somehow, the measurement of one particle causes the outcome of the other article to change.  However, time depends on reference frame.  If the two coins are in relative motion to each other in the right manner, which particle was measured first is relative (There is no universally preferred reference frame).  i.e. One observer might correctly say that the first coin was measured before the second, but another observer might see things reversed.  So, which measurement is the cause and which is the effect?  Another notion is that the outcome was preordained when the coins were made. I&#x27;d have to go into the math a bit to adequately explain this, but with entangled quantum particles you can create experiments that demonstrate this is impossible.  Tests of Bell inequalities are especially notable for this.  This is Einstein&#x27;s &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;, a behavior exhibited by entangled particles.<p><i>The Payoff:</i><p>So, if a measurement performed on two entangled particles is like flipping a pair of coins, how can we use that to communicate. Well, we can&#x27;t.  Not directly.  You see, we can&#x27;t force a coin to come up heads or tails.  If we look at the outcomes of just one coin they will always appear random and uncontrollable.  It&#x27;s when we talk to the guy with the other coin that we&#x27;ll say, &quot;Hey, I knew what you were going to get because of what I got!&quot;.  So, classical communication, limited by the speed of light, is necessary to figure out what these correlations are.  So forget about FTL communication.  However, what about communicating secrets?  Well, that&#x27;s a whole other kettle of fish!  It turns out quantum correlations are <i>fantastic</i> for communicating secret keys.  Google quantum cryptography.<p>As for other applications, google quantum computing. Entanglement is absolutely intrinsic to this field. There are also applications in medical imaging and metrology (i.e. standards of measurements).",1416027241

Lafferty is an oddity. If you think Vonnegut is a bit of an oddball — that digressive, chatty, ironically self-referential style is not for everyone — then Lafferty is something else again. His writing sometimes borders on schizophrenic ramblings, mixing baroque allegory with Vonnegutian tall tales, flamboyant artifice (Wes Anderson comes to mind, but also Borges) and broad vaudeville comedy, with no attention to realism. However, beneath the oddball exterior is a rather thoughtful humanist.<p>His most well-known novel, Past Master, is masterpiece in which politicians from the future kidnap Thomas More to help fix their utopian society.

8610812,comment,8608566,8608566,0,0,toast0,,,"I get things done quickly with a combination things:<p>a) reduce reduce reduce. As much as possible, remove abstraction, remove layers, remove lines of code. A few things are useful to abstract, but for many abstractions, you optimistically trade the underlying complexity for a new layer of different complexity; and then it usually turns out you need to know the underlying layer too, so you actually have twice as much work.<p>b) I don&#x27;t worry about getting things perfect (or locked down) the first time. Most things are poorly specified and will need changes, and it&#x27;s easier to see what you really want, once you have something that&#x27;s close.  Usually, it takes two or three times doing the same thing before you get it right; in that spirit, don&#x27;t stress over the first time.  Also, the least amount of time you&#x27;ve invested in the first draft, the least ego you sacrifice to throw it away and do it right.<p>c) That said, use your experience to make more right choices than wrong ones, especially for things that are hard to change later.  Consider how you will scale things: you don&#x27;t need to make things scalable, but don&#x27;t make it a dead end.<p>d) code re-use (as in calling existing functions) is nice, but don&#x27;t be afraid of some near duplication: changing a core function &quot;a little bit&quot; to get it to work for your new case is a significant time investment. If you&#x27;re not confident that the change will stick, copy and alter; you&#x27;ll be more willing to throw the changes away if you need to after that.",1416025447

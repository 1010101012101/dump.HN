143234,comment,143148,143148,0,0,david927,,,"I think all of this is too simplistic.  Follow your passion, and take bigger risks while you can (because when you're older it gets harder), is great advice.  But Paul needs to understand that his passion is not everyone else's.  I know many people who found a start-up for the wrong reasons.  There's a get-rich-quick-scheme premise in a lot of Web 2.0 start-ups that I find sad.  To look down on employees is to not understand that their passion may lie elsewhere, or that they're waiting for the right moment.  I've had three start-ups and was an employee several times as well.  None of it defines me.",1206179121
143233,comment,143148,143204,0,0,cperciva,,,"That's one way of looking at it, yes -- except that the comparison to caged animals has misleading connotations.  A lion doesn't weigh its options and choose to live in a cage; so to compare someone to a caged lion carries with it the suggestion that they lack agency.",1206179024

143229,comment,143148,143148,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I've worked in Silicon Valley as an ER nurse for the past 2 years, and I've seen a lot of Software Engineers come and go through my department.  And, I'll have to say, at the nurses station, when the patients aren't around, there is a stereotype that we have about Software Engineers, and often snicker at.<p>If a man in his 20's and 30's comes in to triage looking haunted and complaining of chest pain, problems sleeping, or weird psycho-somatic complaints, one of the first questions we ask is, ""Are you a software engineer?""  The answer is invariably, ""Yes.""  And, around the nurses station, we all share a chuckle and a ""tsk, tsk"" at this poor, overworked, overstressed man.<p>There is a stereotype, and like all generalizations, it has it's exceptions.  But, it's enough of a stereotype that the nurses I work with have been very concerned about my going back to school for Computer Science.  Most of the nurses that haven worked in the Valley for years thought that being a software engineer was a crap job compared to being an ER nurse.  And, that's saying something since a substantial portion of our job involves actual crap.  It's wasn't until I explained that I want to start a company that my coworkers became a bit more supportive of the idea.  I even had doctors talk to me in concerned tones about the unhealthy levels of stress that engineers work with in the Valley, to try and talk me out of my second career.  In the ER, we see the same haunted, caged look that Paul refers to in this article.<p>I think that what PG was referring to was the idea of a powerful animal who's behavior and demeanor changes markedly in different environments.  I don't really think that he was trying to put people down who work at a 9-5 for whatever reason.  Paul didn't refer to the 9 to 5'ers as caged monkeys, or caged rats, he called them caged lions for a reason.<p>I don't think that it just applies to Software engineers, either.  I saw the same change in my father when he left his job at 60 to pursue managing his investments 10 years ago.  There was a very marked change in the man.  A great metaphor for that would be describing as the difference as that of a caged lion vs lion roaming free on the savanna.<p>I normally like Jeff's writing.  I have to disagree with him this time.  Perhaps the problem is that maybe Jeff hasn't been on safari.  Perhaps he hasn't seen enough men change like lions set free once they don't have to work a 9-5 that they hate.  Paul says that he's seen similar changes in a number of founder's they've funded over the past couple of years.  As someone who feels rather caged in their day job, I hope I get to see those same changes in myself this fall as I start my first business.",1206178089

143223,comment,143148,143148,0,0,davidw,,,"I don't really agree with Mr. Horror, but sometimes I do wonder what PG does to, shall we say, ""stay challenged"".  Surrounding yourself with younger, less experienced people (albeit very smart ones) who owe you is not an environment I would think of as one likely to create  a lot of pushback.  Maybe it shouldn't, either, as that's not what YC is for, but you do need that kind of thing from somewhere in your life if you wish to continue your intellectual growth.",1206177498
143222,comment,142951,142951,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"My ""quick"" meals are complicated by having an aversion to microwaves (I don't even own one...they make food taste like crap, and I love food more than most things in life, so I would never use it if I had one).<p>A rice cooker is a godsend.  I finally broke down and bought one of the fuzzy logic ones when I moved to California a little over a year ago.  Many wonderful things are possible with trouble-free rice.  Takes only a couple of minutes of prep time, though the cooking time is 20-45 minutes (depending on quantity and type of rice).<p>My quick meals:<p>Fried rice - Scramble an egg, set it aside; dump in frozen vegetables (or fresh, if you have an extra five minutes for washing and chopping) saute in hot oil (as hot as your stove will go) until bright and slightly tender; dump in the rice and some mushroom flavored soy sauce (the good kind from an Asian market); stir it up; dump the egg back in and mix it up.  Serve with a handful of cashews, for an interesting texture and flavor.<p>Black bean burritos - Heat up a can of refried black beans with about a quarter of a jar of good salsa mixed in.  Roll it up in flour tortillas with shredded cheddar and/or pepper jack, lettuce, and tomatoes (the veggies are optional, as the salsa adds some tomatoes and onions and peppers).  Optionally add sour cream and/or guacamole.  Also makes a great dip for tortilla chips.<p>But usually, meals take me longer than ten minutes, and I'm OK with that.  I like to cook most of the time.",1206177454

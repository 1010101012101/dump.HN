In our marketing communications discipline, it is all about actual dollar votes.<p>And because this is marketing communications, it pays to pay attention to the communications end. In fact, it may be the source of your greatest triumphs.""",1183398281

32065,comment,32044,32044,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"What language are you writing your app in? If using J2ME, I would suggest checking out J2ME Polish to organize your builds across multiple platforms. There is a built in device database that lists most phones along with their supported APIs. <p>While it wont replace eventual real-world testing, it at least allows you to focus in on devices that support the specific APIs, form factors, etc that you need and ignore the ones which you do not.<p>The J2ME Polish GUI libraries are also excellent and work well across different devices.",1183397418

Check with centercode.com; they have a pool of volunteer testers, and can send out a survey to select users with the target phones on the target networks. <p>No budget? It's a really tough problem. Test where you can and ask for reports from other users. Offer something of value or interest for detailed bug reports from platforms you can't test yourself. There are only so many J2ME base platforms so you can group by those, but in the end you need to test on each specific device.\n",1183396445

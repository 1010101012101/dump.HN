Hell, if someone gets in jail for being part of anonymous (or, more accurately, for participating in a DDoS advocated by people under the banner of anonymous, or even more likely for having their wifi used by someone to participate in such a DDoS), it will just make all the others more angry. Fighting them would be like fighting tor, or bittorrent; highly distributed, highly decentralized, with no real command structure, and no allegiance to any single website (if one goes down or is monitored, they can always move elsewhere). It's not even an organization, in the old sense; you might as well say that slashdot or HN are organizations[1]. On the upside? Most of them, most of the time, don't care - except when someone makes them angry, they seem fairly passive, more interested in their own amusement than anything else (yes, I occasionally lurk on 4chan) - and even then, there are probably only a few thousand who actually participate in things like this [not that I have actual numbers to support this, but still - someone who's more interested could start lurking on IRC channels mentioned in image macros (such as the one in the article) and keep track of how many unique individuals show up].<p>Or you could always kill them off by destroying anonymity in the internet - force everyone to use their real names everywhere, to provide concrete linkages to real personalities. That's the only way to stop people from taking advantage of anonymity.<p>I'm sorry that this turned into a rant; it was originally going to be a lot shorter.

1114240,comment,1113684,1114111,0,0,btilly,,,"20 developers has lower productivity for a lot more reasons than individual incentives.  This has been widely recognized since <i>The Mythical Man-Month</i>.<p>Concrete data point for you that I ran across in <i>Software Estimation</i> by Steve McConnell.  The average team of 5-8 programmers can get a medium sized project done in the same calendar time as a team of 20 programmers.  As teams grow beyond 20 programmers, total throughput improves.  This is from a study with project side measured in lines of code.  There is every reason to believe that the larger team has more reinvention within their project, and therefore their project of equivalent size has less functionality.<p>The fundamental reason has to do with lines of communication.  As you add a person to a team, the number of lines of communication you add is the size of the team.  At some point people take up more energy from others than they contribute useful work themselves.  There are a myriad of organizational techniques which try to mitigate this problem, but all suffer from the defect that they force people to use less productive forms of communication (for instance writing documents that can be read by many others), and therefore lower individual productivity.<p>Therefore if you've got 20 developers you should seriously consider going back to a small team, find a way to partition them into groups with minimal interactions, or scale your organization up until you have a lot more developers than that.  The first two try to solve organizational problems that lead to low throughput, the last accepts the issues but lets you tackle problems that the small team couldn't.<p>Another random suggestion.  If you're interested in productivity, pick up a copy of <i>Peopleware</i> and <i>Rapid Development</i>, read them, and pick a set of best practices to try.",1265777446

I've read other people criticizing the poor standard of documentation of some parts of Ruby and Ruby libraries, and from my recent experiences, I can sympathize.  But as a maintainer of an open source library, I can also sympathize with the feeling that documentation always seems like a lower priority compared with new features.<p>Recently I've been getting a lot of user support requests that have made me realize I have to lift my own game when it comes to documentation.

1114218,comment,1113684,1114054,0,0,btilly,,,"Let's see.  Your response to the 3 UI changes question is <i>Measure the change in usage for each screen or section of the app that each team worked on.</i>  From that I conclude that you've probably never done A/B testing and discovered how difficult those deltas are to accurately measure, or discovered how changes upstream waterfall down through your site.  The amount of data you need to narrow down performance changes to within, say, 5% is much more than most people realize.  And from a business view you don't want to do that for the simple reason that once you have a demonstrated improvement, continuing the measurement to figure out the exact win is costing you real money.<p>If, as with several of my employers, people take a long time from engaging with your website to making money for you, the tracking problems get MUCH more challenging.  When you add complex social dynamics on top of it (such as person A getting person B to make a purchase), you're in for a world of fun.  (Yes, I've worked on a site that had to solve exactly this problem.)<p>Measuring support calls per user is also not as simple as it looks.  Different parts of your site generate support calls at different rates.  And it isn't always obvious what part of the site generated the call.  This gets worse if you have the long lead time issue that I've faced multiple times.<p>As for whether QA is viewed as a roadblock, that depends strongly on team dynamics.  But in places I've seen that had that bad mindset, things can get very, very bad.<p>On the randomizing tests, sure you can limit how many users are shown the option.  But when someone makes changes that introduce technical debt on the back end, that debt and resulting bugs can't be segregated out so easily.  Sometimes you really just need to say no to features.  Anything that limits your freedom to do that is a Bad Thing.<p>Now don't get me wrong.  I like the idea of performance based pay.  My current employer (Google) is all about performance pay.  But you have to structure the incentives right.  Giving people pay after the fact based on feedback from people around you creates incentives to not just optimize a flawed metric, but to work together as a team and get stuff done.<p>This is important enough that while I'd read with interest what the experience of this experiment was like, I'd personally not want to be involved in anything like it until I'd been convinced that it really works like you hope it will.",1265776757

You're starting to get a feel for how the city operates.

Hair and fibers end up wound around the brushes and wheels and quickly stop them from working entirely.  My vacuum does not have this issue.  My broom does not have this issue.  My mop does not have this issue.  Honestly, it feels like I spend as much time cleaning my robots as it would take to just vacuum and mop by hand.",1265774491

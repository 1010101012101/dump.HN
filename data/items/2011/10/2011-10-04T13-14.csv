The only use case where this stuff doesn't work is on long hauls or roadtrips. In that case you are acting like a gas car owner.

The fact is that hard-disks and SSDs are much slower than RAM, RAM memory is much slower than L2 cache, which is slower than L1 cache, which is slower than when registers get accessed. You achieve good performance characteristics when you keep your data in one place, keeping your most accessed items in the CPU's cache, or at least prevent those items from being stored in swap.<p>Food for thought: the NoSQL solutions so loved by Rails or Node.js developers are mostly written in C/C++ and rely on Posix threads, with some Erlang here and there.<p><pre><code>     might sound more convenient to use threads

</code></pre>
That's because it IS more convenient to use threads instead of processes in most cases.  You can mostly get away with it only when the processes don't need to synchronize (i.e. your workload can be processed fully in parallel), but when processes do need to synchronize lots of bad shit can happen, as processes are more unreliable than threads.<p>Of course, I'm referring to real kernel-managed POSIX threads and processes, not what Erlang does, but then again, the Erlang's light-weight processes are just an abstraction over POSIX threads, not processes as that would have been dumb.",1317736488

Some say that already is a simpler language that offers improvements over Java without the overwhelming power of Scala, but it hasn't been widely adopted. There are many theories for this, my own is that it maybe doesn't offer enough new stuff for someone to make the effort to switch. Scala clearly does add a lot of value, so that should be a lesson for newcomers. Offer enough new stuff for people to be interested.<p>I'm glad he at least mentioned Fantom. I haven't done much other than play around with it, but it seems like a much prettier ""better"" Java than a lot of the other contenders. I've never understood why it hasn't ""caught on.""

I have a few friends who actually ""made it"" but still haven't learned those essential skills.  I wonder what may happen if one day they happen to face tight budget.  They probably wouldn't last long.<p>Some background: My mom made about $8000 a year, and my three siblings and I we were lucky to have temporarily free housing from a richer sibling.  So, with food stamps, welfare, my absent dad's union health insurance we got by.<p>Eventually, I found my way into a gifted program at a small, urban city school. That, at least, put me on an academic track.  My class size was about 400, and the gifted group was about 15.  By the end of the 12th year, I would guess that, of my gifted class, probably 40% had dropped out.  The class merged with the honors students in 11th grade because of attrition.  However, I made friends with some honors students who were of working class and poor backgrounds.<p>Again, by sheer luck, I happened to get accepted at a state college.  After meandering around for a couple of years, I happened to made the right decision by banking on computer science, even though I had never used a computer until I was 15 and didn't own one until my junior year of college.  Those years of constantly fighting with the student aid program were some of the most stressful years of my life.  Now, I make over 100K as a high-end developer.  I have done well for myself.<p>However, most of the other gifted and honors students haven't fared so well.  I do have a few friends that have also done well using Computer Science as a gateway out of poverty.  However, those friends sadly still haven't figured out how to do basic bookkeeping or balance their checkbooks.  But, in all honesty, I did not figure that out until I was 28 or so.<p>Anyway, without savings, with poor life skills, and a lot of debt, even those smart kids are probably likely at risk.  If ever the software development market turns down, if they're out of a job for an extended period of time, I wonder what will happen to them, as well.",1317734431

No risky sacrifices (medical bills paid, job attended to), no luxuries until affordable (and sentimentality is a luxury).<p>I should have taken copious notes (maybe I will on another pass) and comment how, instead of viewing it all as crushing poverty, it is indicative of living in a luxurious society. Opt for the $1 hamburger, and be told ""that's why so many poor are overweight""? WTH? If it's got that many calories then cut it in half and eat it across two meals! If you're obese, you're not poor; talk to the half of the world's population which lives on less than $2/day.<p>So, coming out a couple hundred dollars ahead, I could run this ""poverty"" scenario for 4 months and have enough to buy a refurbished MacBook Air and join the Apple Developer's Program, with which I could bootstrap an iOS App-writing business. Seems some others played, came out over $1000 ahead, and could jump in to app-writing in one month flat.<p>Read between the lines in the game, and see the opportunities that abound. Sell the car and take the bus. Focus the kids on learning entrepreneuring instead of sports. Take in a decent paying roommate (and throw out the rowdy one bodily if need be).

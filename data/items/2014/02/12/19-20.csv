Exploiting the fact that social networks and search engines can extract the vain behaviors of people, one or companies can easily exploit such phenomenon (for fun or for profit because corporations can have ability to absolve individuals of personal liability by exchanging capital gained from such endeavors to the State) to cause discomfort to such audiences that would not care or be aware of such things that are increasingly discussed on HN, thus opening up the discomfort surface for other issues to seep through.<p>All this to say, the means for The People (whomever and wherever they may be) to exhibit such control or sovereignty over themselves is already here (and always has, or so can be argued) if one looks around for just a little bit, so the time probably hasn&#x27;t come but history suggests (especially in times of economic turmoil) that such times are always around the corner. But history also suggests that, in the aftermath of such things, they won&#x27;t appear quite the same as they were looked upon before.<p>[0] <a href=""http://dangerousprototypes.com/2013/02/28/defcon-20-renderman-on-ads-b-aero-radio/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dangerousprototypes.com/2013/02/28/defcon-20-renderma...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://youtu.be/HS38q3YXsY4?t=12m48s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/HS38q3YXsY4?t=12m48s</a>",1392234980

7226809,comment,7225765,7225765,2,0,x0054,,,"While in college I also felt out of place and friendless for some time. My suggestion to college students now would be to join clubs around your interests. Soccer, ultimate frisbee, archery, chess, trading cards, what ever. Just make a little effort, and I am sure you will find friends. Join clubs you personally like, rather then clubs that make you look cool or something like that. This way you&#x27;ll actually hang out with people who like the same things you do, and may give you more of a chance.<p>To colleges, create a system that makes it easy to organize such clubs and maintain them. Like a college centric meetup. Set it up and promote the hell out of it to the first years. Perhaps there is a startup opportunity here, to make the system and sell it to colleges! Facebook works well for this, but it would be easier to do this if there was a central repository of different group that college students have started, and a simple way to request university resources, like rooms, etc.<p>On suicide, this may sound cold, but if you want to kill your self, do it. Honestly, I feel it&#x27;s every persons right to dispose off with their life as they will. But DO NOT threaten suicide as a way to get attention! Doing so is no different then you taking someone as a hostage and threatening to kill that person just to get attention. You are basically saying to the world &quot;Pay attention to me, and if you do not, someone is going to die, and it&#x27;s YOUR fault.&quot; If you feel really sad, call your friends and be honest, tell them that you feel really sad and you NEED someone to talk to desperately. If they are your true friends, they will make time for you. I would, for any of the people I call friends, no matter the time of night or what ever. And if they ignore you, telling them you are going to kill your self isn&#x27;t going to change anything, they are not your friends, and they don&#x27;t give a shit. Call your parents or family, if that&#x27;s an option. Parents may seem like distant and not understanding at that age, but in most cases they will stick by you even if you have no one else.<p>Finally, just food for thought, my dad once told me this about evolution: In nature the &quot;winners&quot; are those creatures that pass their genes on to the next generation, and the &quot;losers&quot; are those creatures who&#x27;s genetic lineage is cut off. Just based on the fact that you are alive today you can be assured that you come for a very, very, very long line of winners. So, when you feel down on your self, just remember, there are millions of generations of creatures which came before you. They figured out how to succeed in life, thus making you possible, and so will you, just give it time. Just about the only way to lose in life it to stop playing. So check out if you like, but if you stick around, the odds are on your side.",1392234514

I like the spirit that ethical/competency self-regulation instills in the legal profession, but I&#x27;m not sure whether the ultimate market impact is a good thing or not. On one hand, I think the financial industry has suffered from a lack of such regulation (e.g. Goldman advising clients to buy certain products while taking an adverse position themselves). On the other hand, the potential liability and need for insurance creates barriers to entry, driving up prices. Given the staggering potential losses from software, professional malpractice insurance probably wouldn&#x27;t be cheap. But on the third, alien, hand, I think licensure also has a downward effect on the cost of legal services, by making lawyers more fungible than they would otherwise be (in the absence of licensure, the market might come to rely on an even rarer signal of credibility).<p>The economic dynamics of licensed professions are a bit more complex than either side of the &quot;developers should be professionals&quot; debate really appreciates.",1392233998

Here is what I think regarding the case you brought up in the previous post:<p>ES is suitable for full-text based document indexing for enterprise level or any websites, which means they have a reasonable amount of data to be indexed in a given timeframe. A complete re-indexing won&#x27;t not take for a couple of days.<p>So the basic idea behind the NoSQL database is to dump the data into the database quickly and return, so you can see very fast response for insert and delete. Then it will load the data into the memory to process for real-time retrieval which also produces fast response from select. I&#x27;m not sure about update.<p>If the data volume grows, they quickly add shards or make the number of pre-shards big enough to allocate enough memory resources to handle the queries or let the OS to swap the memories by adding more server nodes.<p>So if you want to use NoSQL database, you must be bound with the system requirement and make your application fit into that and take the most advantage from it. Otherwise, if you are running high structured data store, better to use relational database.<p>Another point is: if the documents are collected from the web like search engine, NoSQL will not fit for the large volume of data and relational database is also used to store the indexed data for fast retrieval. I guess this is what you meant &quot;general-purpose primary store&quot;.<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.",1392232992

When NoSQL databases started coming out, it was really about which CAP guarantee a database chooses to compromise. Traditional SQL databases are either partition-intolerant or become unavailable (for writes) in the event of a partition. NoSQL databases compromise on consistency. If a database is claiming to be NoSQL and have ACID transactions, they&#x27;ve either disproven CAP or aren&#x27;t part of the new group of distributed, partition-tolerant databases that people have been calling NoSQL. It&#x27;s been said for a while that NoSQL is a terrible name for that group of technologies and now that we&#x27;re getting databases with a non-SQL interface but also having consistency guarantees, the name is starting to cause even more confusion.<p>Side note: Happy Found customer here...you guys have made it much easier to run our ES index!",1392231922

I seem to remember reading somewhere that motherboards that go into a mineral oil bath are basically impossible to clean afterwards.  This point seems important, since mineral oil is used here for its electrically insulating properties.  There are many contact pads in the marrying of RAM DIMM to slot.  Ergo, replacing sticks of RAM in such a supercomputer would probably be a nightmare.  And this nightmare would likely be frequent in its occurrence.<p>I also take issue with the first sentence of the article.  Submerging a home computer in mineral oil is a common practice.  Their &quot;technology&quot; editor needs some more technology chops, it would seem.<p>Another note: Let&#x27;s hope they aren&#x27;t secretly using polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in place of mineral oil to give themselves a boost.

Ten years ago, it was a problem for the ACM community, and imho the problem only got worse with time, because it is becoming latently ubiquitous. Maybe it does have to do with the functional illiteracy, even among the ranks of the highly literate.<p>You are also right about the cheap Dell: they do have ubuntu, but price/performance pales in comparison to say, Vista. I can only hope, that the Japanese market will embrace this product -- they generally have one of the strongest FreeBSD culture, which might be enough for the kickstart.",1229269987

No fuss, no muss.<p>On the tarsnap side, it makes sure not to duplicate storage or bandwidth for duplicate parts.  Anytime you want to get a specific backup back, you just reference it by name.  You can list the available archives.  It's all encrypted.  Pricing is based on what you actually use (rather than being rounded) which makes it ideal for small things as you can pay fractions of a cent.<p>It's definitely something to look into.",1229269927

ToI). It is tiring to listen to the ""phoren"" returnees living in their gated communities, complaining daily about the traffic and power-outages. Bah!<p>After having studied in what is arguably the best undergraduate tech campus in Bangalore, I know what goes around for ""research"" and ""high tech"" in computer science departments.<p>All the undergraduate schools are solely focussed on getting you into one of the SWITCH companies. Woe be you if you had an independent mind and tried to join a more hacker friendly company like Google/Thoughtworks etc.. The immediate family will start distressing over you not making it to the holy shrines of Infy, Wipro etc.,<p>Some interesting discussion here: <a href=""http://www.pluggd.in/entrepreneurship/why-wipro-infosys-and-tcs-are-the-axis-of-evil-for-indian-startup-space-2439/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pluggd.in/entrepreneurship/why-wipro-infosys-and-...</a><p>Of course all is not doom and gloom. The hacker scene is quite vibrant with Python/Ruby/FOSS communities being as active as anywhere in the world. Quite a few youngsters are getting into the startup mode. Even if a lot of them are testing the waters by attending startup events, reading and blogging about it, being on HN and boot strapping their ideas while living with their parents (not many basements in Bangalore, I'm afraid :).<p>Going forward, I strongly believe that these independent hackers will do more for the startup scene than the ""bill-by-the-hour"" Goliaths.",1229269277

Giving the company money and not ensuring it gets where it needs to go is gross negligence.  I could buy this argument, however: if we need to put constraints on it, then that's a business that needs to fail.",1229269004

This means that for every GB uploaded, there are about 33 thousand blocks.<p>S3 PUTs cost $0.01 per thousand PUTs, so writing each of the blocks as an individual S3 object would cost $0.33 / GB for PUTs (plus the normal $0.10 / GB for bandwidth).",1229268553

The Bell Labs guys know how to do this, see their languages Alef and Limbo.  Channels, message passing, etc.  Also, a UK university used to have some nice slides about doing the same thing in Occam, including an O(1) ""sort pump"".  They all inherit the concept from Hoare's CSP.  Perhaps now some of them, rob, ken, etc., have moved to Google we'll see a resurgence with it.",1229268508

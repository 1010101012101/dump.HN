This is due to the actual need for it (or rather lack of), the false &quot;become fluent&quot; promises by the language schools (like CNA, Fisk, Skill, Wizard, etc.), the cost of taking a course for the student, the methodology of said schools, and the lack of daily contact with people from other cultures in Brazil (tied to my first point).<p>As for the teacher, working in a school like the ones mentioned, you get low pay (not too many years ago it was about $7/hr) and no leeway in terms of hours and method.

7719958,comment,7716447,7718976,2,0,mapt,,,"The Communist Party of China will only allow large corporations to function insofar as they retain some control over their operations, even if that control is only occasionally utilized.  The degree of guanxi necessary to succeed at the less formal regulations present in China is at a minimum that a Party member gets some degree of control - and their loyalty is not to the company, but to the party, like a political officer on a submarine.<p>That means, effectively, that every relationship with a Chinese arm of one&#x27;s company is a partnership with the Chinese government, if push comes to shove, rather than a subsidiary relationship.<p>This is the clearest explanation I&#x27;ve found of the <i>enormous</i> difference between the somewhat alien structure of Chinese ventures and the familiar Western model:<p><i>&quot;By “the Party,” I’m of course referring to the Communist Party of China (CPC, also known as the Chinese Communist Party or CCP), the political organization founded in 1921 which, under Mao Zedong, fought a revolutionary war that ultimately brought it to power in 1949.  It is a Leninist party, which means that unlike most Western political parties, it is a tightly-organized, hierarchical organization similar to a military unit or religious order.  In the United States, there is no such thing as being a “member” of the Republican or Democratic Party — the closest thing would be to register to vote in either party’s primary.  Republican or Democratic “committees,” on either the local or national level, are really just funding and support co-ops for helping candidates; they are in no position to issue orders to voters, activists, candidates, or elected officials.  Joining the Communist Party of China, in contrast, is a formal and highly selective process that takes several years to complete.  Once initiated, a member must obey Party directives and take on whatever task (including official positions) the Party assigns.  If they misbehave, or even break a law, they will be detained, investigated, and punished by the Party, not the police — only after being expelled from the Party will they be turned over to the country’s regular legal system for prosecution.<p>The best way to think of the Party is to imagine the human resources department of a huge multinational corporation — except that in this case, this HR department is so powerful it gets to appoint everyone from the Board and the CEO to the lowliest janitor, so it effectively calls the shots.  In China, every government ministry, every military unit, every state-owned company – and in many cases private companies as well – has a Party committee that decides all major personnel issues and, in doing so, essentially acts as the power behind the throne.  Now sometimes the boss of the more visible entity is also head of the Party unit, which means the formal boss actually does call the shots.  But if the two roles are split — as they are, for instance, in every province — you can bet that the Party chief is the one holding most of the real power.<p>The Party’s 78 million members (a little over 5% of China’s total population) are essentially a pool of pre-screened candidates who can be slotted into whatever official role the Party leadership decides — with the understanding, of course, that their primary loyalty remains to the Party that put them there.  Directives from Party superiors — on who to assign or promote, or what policies to pursue– are ultimately far more important than instructions received from more formal channels like ministries, courts, or corporate boards.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://chovanec.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/primer-on-chinas-leadership-transition/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chovanec.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/primer-on-chinas-le...</a>",1399624918

The ten-year average has been 2.7% for a 26 year doubling.<p><a href=""http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/05/09/growth-in-global-natural-gas-consumption-slowed-la.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/05/09/growth-in-g...</a><p>That&#x27;s reflected as well in BP&#x27;s annual review for 2013:<p><a href=""http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy-2013/2012-in-review/natural-gas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/energy-econom...</a><p>The &quot;gas reserves are trending upward&quot; comment is consistent with the passage immediately preceding in Wikipedia noting that new discovery estimates are hard to establish, so they&#x27;re often amended upwards.  The increasing reserves noted by BP&#x27;s CEO aren&#x27;t the result of new finds, but of revised estimates of <i>old</i> finds.  And new gas field discoveries peaked in the 1970s, 40 years ago.  We&#x27;re not finding <i>new</i> gas, we&#x27;re simply recognizing how much was <i>already</i> found.<p>Fracking also isn&#x27;t turning up new gas fields, but is allowing known plays to be further extracted.  Again, it&#x27;s digging further into what we&#x27;d already known about.<p>So:  given BP&#x27;s 2013 report of proved reserved of 187 trillion cubic meters, present consumption of 3,314 billion cubic meters, and an annual growth trend of 2.7%, we&#x27;ll actually exhaust reserves by 2047.

On top of that a BB exploit could in theory (with no IOMMU protection) provide access to the full system memory, and I agree with this. But my point remains: there is no need to single out the BB there. And putting a backdoor in the BB doesn&#x27;t make sense to me from an engineering point of view (and doesn&#x27;t match my experience in the area either).<p>We&#x27;re talking about integrated BB where the BB is on the same die as the rest of the system. Just put the backdoor function at the system level, accessible from any interface. Why do a special case for the BB? There&#x27;s no point in that, as there&#x27;s no gain. If anyone goes to the trouble to insert such a backdoor, isn&#x27;t it better to make it accessible remotely thought any interface, and through all local interfaces?<p>Even better, call it a secure remote management function, with remotely upgradable firmware, and make it usable for professional use cases. And still being usable as a backdoor. What&#x27;s better than hiding in plain sight?<p>So I don&#x27;t dispute the notion that there could be backdoors in chips. What I find illogical is to single out the BB for this. Any interface with bus master ability and a local CPU (WiFi, BT, cellular...) can on principle be exploited in the same way, on a SoC with no IOMMU protection. So instead of making juicy story with backdoored BBs and nasty telcos, why not address the general case and insist on having systems with an IOMMU controlled by the main CPU? Then an open source system can protect the main CPU and system memory against bugs in any peripheral behind the IOMMU.<p>That won&#x27;t protect against a &quot;security/management function&quot; designed to bypass the IOMMU of course. At some point there is no substitute for trusting (or not...) the chip maker. But at least that would protect against a whole class of bugs, which is a win IMHO.",1399623102

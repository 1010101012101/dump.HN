4843105,comment,4840807,4842753,3,0,laumars,,,"indeed. Windows has come a long way too. I'm not the biggest fan of Windows (strictly personal preference) but I used to love Windows 2000. It was clean, simple yet had a lot of power behind it. Yet Microsoft left telnet turn on by default (and this was back before most homes had routes and thus hardware firewalls).<p>It was an amazingly short sighted move, but such things were typical back then. And it's only from learning the hard way that we've managed to get to the stage we're at now.<p>However I think it's often forgotten that servers need a different set of security profiles depending on the server's role and where it is sat. For example, a webserver sat behind a hardware load balancer wouldn't necessarily need much SSH protection as the webfarm HTTP traffic should be on a different VLAN to the internal systems administration traffic (which in turn, would be another different VLAN to the company's staff VLAN). So it would be almost impossible to get access to an OpenSSH log in, let alone attack it. Where as most consumer VPS solutions put all their customer servers in the DMZ, which means it's up to the customer to provide software preventions to harden against access that would normally be protected with a complex hardware solution in more professional / clustered set ups.<p>And this is why you can't fully trust default configs; there simply is no ""one size fits all"" solution so package maintainers instead opt for the best compromises.",1354117936

4843100,comment,4842947,4843036,11,0,TazeTSchnitzel,,,"Bitcoin works by having ""blocks"" of data, containing transaction history (every Bitcoin transfer someone has made - it is only actually made when incorporated into a block), ""mined"" by a network. These blocks are mined by incrementing a value in the block of data computing a hash of it, until it falls within a certain range. The fact the hash must be in this range results in Bitcoin miners having to do millions of hash computations until they find the correct one, creating a significant level of difficulty in producing a block. This difficulty means that it is difficult to spend Bitcoins twice, since you would theoretically need to control 50% of the computing power working away at it. Each miner is competing with every other to mine the next block first. Whoever does so can add a ""reward"" of Bitcoins to the block of transactions, and this is how new Bitcoins are made. Over time, the Bitcoin network increases the difficulty by making the range of valid hashes narrower, so that even as more miners join the network, it will still take roughly 10 minutes until the next block is mined. What's happened in this case is that now the reward, previously 50 BTC, has been halved to 25 BTC. I should note that miners can also deduct transaction fees... anyone who makes a transaction can add a small fee. This adds an additional incentive for miners to mine a block beyond the other reward. It also means, of course, that they prioritise whoever pays the highest fee.",1354117921

Processing transactions is done in blocks, and the process is called 'mining' because for every processed block, the person who processes the block gets 25 BTC (before today that was 50 BTC) plus the transaction fees. Obviously 25 BTC is a lot, which is why it's so hard to mine blocks. Mining is often done in groups, and the person who mines a block has to share the profits with the rest of that group.<p>IIRC the entire Bitcoin community mines 6 blocks per hour, and it's the mining process that keeps Bitcoin going, because without miners there couldn't be any transactions.",1354117873

It's a good principle, and Rails model classes are also a good choice of an example where it's frequently violated.<p>Rails practically <i>begs</i> you to disregard SRP in your models. It entices you to put all your validation logic, relationship specifications, retrieval logic and business logic into one gigantic basket. Under these circumstances ""fat models"" become ""morbidly obese models"".<p>Rails 3 introduced ""concerns"" as a means of organizing the bloat into mixins. These are a testability nightmare. There doesn't seem to be any clean way of testing concerns without instantiating one of the model classes that include them.<p>The only way to use ActiveRecord without sacrificing testability, SRP, and the OP's application of ""the Unix philosophy to Object Design"" seems to be by limiting usage of it to to a pure persistence layer. But doing so seems to preclude using most of the ActiveRecord features that make it so convenient in the first place. Can anybody set me straight on this somehow? I would love to be completely wrong about everything I've just written here.",1354117615
4843071,comment,4841168,4842853,1,0,_delirium,,,"I use grep in some pipelines to bulk-process data, because if you have a fast grep, using it to pre-filter input files to remove definitely-not-matching lines is one of the quickest ways to speed up some kinds of scripts without rewriting the whole thing. And in that case, sometimes processing gigabytes+ of data, it's nice if it's fast.<p>One common case: I have a Perl script processing a giant file, but it only processes certain lines that match a test. You can move that test to grep, to remove nonmatching lines before Perl even hits them, which will typically be much faster than making Perl loop through them.<p>Say your script.pl is doing something like:<p><pre><code>    next unless /relevant/;\n</code></pre>\nYou can replace that with:<p><pre><code>    grep ""relevant"" filename | perl ./script.pl</code></pre>",1354117613

4843003,comment,4842024,4842558,2,0,ebrenes,,,"All abstractions are leaky. Visual Studio and its associated files are meant to act as helpers and thus abstract away several details of the project, what it does with them but there's still a process to it all.<p>Project files are like build scripts and changing them can cause breaks. Just like wanton changes in a build script can do the same. If you proceed working with VS, I'd suggest familiarizing yourself with project files and how they're set up. All automated processes make assumptions and rely on certain conventions. I've yet to meet an automated process that can adapt itself to any situation to suit its user's whims.<p>For new developers I generally recommend they review all changes they commit, including project files. Just because its an abstraction or things happen automatically doesn't mean you can just push all changes into the repository. When you open a 2008 project in 2010 you are prompted that changes will take place for example, so it's not like it was a stealth change.<p>Once they're properly set up project files are pretty maintenance free, but certain behaviors can make them unstable to use.<p>For example, if you need to support both VS2008 and VS2010, just create duplicates, it's no different than having build scripts that are not backwards compatible, you'll have to keep multiple versions around. Or just keep the VS2010 conversion locally and don't commit that back into the repository.<p>Anyways, you can go back to a simple text editor and just use msbuild manually, if you prefer keeping track of everything manually. best of luck!",1354116970

From the article, it would appear that most of the ""sell"" was done via other media (social, email, traditional links). After their A/B tests, I could assume that they are leaving the sell of ""why"" up to the users. This allows the designers to focus on conversions.<p>Lastly, the four steps aren't traditional ""checkout"" steps.

I buy $1000, 20 year old cars and sell them at a loss when I leave the country.<p>The totality of what I own and keep is around $5000 worth of stuff that all fits into a 40L backpack and a largish box that I mail to and from my family's house when I'm going to be working.

In the absence of any hard numbers, my intuition is that the number of people suffering from a bike-light-induced-epilepsy incident would be much lower than the number of people suffering a hit-by-car-when-not-using-flashing-light incident, due to the lower number of suffers than cyclists and the requirement to come across a cyclist with light flashing at an appropriate rate, in their direction, with sufficient brightness.

To which end, you can just use cash.<p>This article however is about business/freelance type work. And at least here in the UK, the taxman is just as interested in individuals doing business deals as it is with corps. If you think that you don't run the risk of getting caught, bear in mind that anonymous off-the-books cash transactions, including international deals, have been happening since time immemorial, and the taxman regularly collars offenders.<p>With regards to localbitcoin, the moment you hand over your btc in return for their cash, (here in the UK at least) a taxable transaction has occurred and they can compel (via arrest if necessary) you to provide your identity.<p>If you avoid public forums and launder your btc with only trusted friends/contacts, you may get away with it. But you're limiting your market and reducing the exchange rate you'll get.<p>And if you start pulling in larger amounts and converting that to cash successfully anonymously, you start having the same problems drug dealers do when laundering their money that came from untaxed sources. Here in the UK, you won't be able to use bank accounts as money laundering regs mean larger deposits have to be explained and notified, and of course bank records are just that, records. Likewise if you go to purchase that shiny new car in cash, money laundering regs kick in again.<p>So for small amounts you will probably get away with it, but the taxman doesn't care too much about those, and such transactions already exist as ""cash-in-hand"" work without btc. Bigger transactions are just as problematic as cash, unless everything you want to buy is available from sellers who accept btc and delete their shipping records (or provide the product digitally).",1354115647

It's really known as ""High ion exchange glass""  This in turn, gives it very high compressive strength.  However, it does have a significant downside that never gets mentioned:\nShock absorption and scratches can cause later cracks and shattering.\nThis is just a fact of life. When you place the outer layer under compressive strain, and then begin to compromise part of the outer layer, or begin to stress it, you can eventually cause release of those compressive forces.  Once partially compromised, it may seem to be good, but can fail instantly.",1354115491

Most technologies used in games even today are hacks, using precomputed values oftentimes derived from ray traced models. Raytracing is quite natural to work with because it simulates real world objects and does so in a realistic manner. The only difficulty might be caused by the lack of such real-time raytracing hardware as depicted here causing slower development as one has to wait for a scene or animation to render. IMO, raytracing is indeed the pinnacle of photorealistic rendering currently.",1395190324

7426155,comment,7425521,7425951,7,0,icebraining,,,"Even if we take street congestion to be a tragedy of the commons, it&#x27;s not obvious that more cabs imply more congestion, since as part of a network of public transportation, they may help reduce personal car usage.<p>But even if we take it for granted, I still think your approach is pernicious. The issue with your - and the city&#x27;s - method is that while the claimed problem is congestion, the solution is to limit the number of registered cars per service. But the error in that reasoning is that it presumes that they are perfectly correlated, and so it prevents market players from coming up with better solutions that reduce congestion without reducing the number of cars.<p>For example, services like Uber which rely completely on calls via the Internet have the potential to cause much lower congestion compared to a service that relies on having idle drivers drive around looking for people waving their arms.<p>If one wants to reduce congestion, then the only good solution is to tax cars driving in congested areas.",1395190307

7426121,comment,7422959,7424015,4,0,ANTSANTS,,,"I think there is a connection; &quot;AAA&quot; games suck for a lot of the same reasons that Hollywood films suck:<p>* The &quot;average joe&quot; gamer/moviegoer expects incredibly lavish productions with photorealism, explosions, over-the-top action, etc. Making a game/movie for this audience is very expensive and very risky: They need to spend a lot, and charge a lot to a huge audience to make up the difference.<p>* So that developer/studio tries to minimize their risk and sticks to what they know how to make and what they know people will buy: the same two genres over and over and over again (FPS and third person action, or over-the-top action and screwball comedy), lavish &quot;set pieces&quot; and gimmicks that look cool in advertising but don&#x27;t contribute anything at all to the gameplay/story (like &quot;the one building you can destroy&quot; or the &quot;quick-time event&quot;: &quot;press X to watch the main character do something really cool instead of just doing something cool yourself&quot;), big-name actors for promotional value, etc etc. Some aspects like writing quality aren&#x27;t considered as important and aren&#x27;t given as much attention. Some things that make a <i>better game/movie</i> would be actively harmful to its commercial success (true novelty, gameplay/plot that takes effort from the audience to understand/appreciate), and so these qualities are avoided.<p>* Despite being incredibly formulaic and so on, these games/movies are very successful with their target audiences. To add another layer of metaphor, they&#x27;re the fast food of their mediums: unremarkable and probably bad for you, but highly available and consistent in their quality. You might wish it were better, but you&#x27;ll probably enjoy yourself on some level regardless. Critics and more sophisticated gamers/moviegoers decry the state of their respective industries at large while temporarily ignoring all of the cool stuff put out by smaller studios and passionate hobbyists.<p>In the decades before expensive CG raised the expectations of gamers and moviegoers alike, there was always the equivalent of these successful but substanceless creations, but you saw a lot more experimentation coming out of the big studios. The same company could put out a generic space shooter (sorry, shmup fans) today and a unique exploration game tomorrow. It&#x27;s simply not feasible for those same companies today to dedicate as many resources on niche titles as they do for their blockbusters, and at the same time they&#x27;ve forgotten how to do small productions. It&#x27;s not the end of the world, because digital distribution and crowdfunding gives the little guys the power to strike out on their own, create niche, experimental productions, and survive, but it is sad to me that these media juggernauts do more to advance the state of the art in computer graphics than they do in gameplay or storytelling.

The 8/7 member split between parties sounds nice and non-partisan but might be biased in favour of the minority. Also, nomination to the post depends on party favour.\n- a mechanism guaranteeing that the intelligence committee obtains ALL pertinent documents sans curation by the agencies. It&#x27;s certainly ridiculous that there&#x27;s even the possibility the CIA could claim that the Intelligence Committee obtained some documents illegally.\n- finally, a notion of weighting actions appropriately. The intelligence committee is not in the business of taking action in itself, but making recommendations for the rest of congress to act on (subject to weights based on their political stances and the requirements of the situation). These weights are unfortunately being re-normalized to near even odds along purely political lines in the senate and in the media.<p>While the representational biases can be repaired somewhat with appropriate procedure, the final problem of retaining the right weights for actions doesn&#x27;t seem solvable so long as the first amendment is around. One can&#x27;t silence Fox/MSNBC pundits constantly trying to put their spins on every debate, and it&#x27;s difficult to correctly evaluate these solutions unless the public can actually gauge the adequacy of each approach against all the data.<p>tl;dr: IMO the ability to take optimal rational decisions via proxy opinions from the intelligence committee is severely mitigated by biases inherent in the institution.

(Not to mention our military.) That includes authorizing various forms of secrecy.<p>You may not agree with all that, but the remedy is to elect different representatives, who have been clearly informed by the voters that preventing a terrorist attack is now lower priority, so it&#x27;s OK to spend a lot less money on it. And of course, those same voters would have to agree not to complain to the government if the drastic reduction in spending resulted in an attack happening that could have been prevented if spending on intel had been higher.<p>The fundamental problem is that we want two things: freedom, and safety.

Industries can only be disrupted by entrants that provide products that consumers prefer, so we have almost-a-law: disruption is a <i>preferable-to-consumers</i> thing. There a few cases where that&#x27;s not socially desirable (I suppose crack replacing cocaine would be an example) but those are exceptional enough that I think we ought to regard disruption as presumed good unless shown otherwise.<p>Similarly, a decent heuristic for choosing whose interests to consider out of an established industry and a competitor is to let consumers choose which one is better. Of course this can be difficult for those in the established industry, but we&#x27;re in a society-wide Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma over this, and a useful function of government would be making sure we all cooperate.

As someone that&#x27;s lived in both the Java and Ruby worlds for a long time I&#x27;d say that in a many number of cases you&#x27;re right. The &quot;shiny object&quot; syndrome is much less of a factor in the Java world and things like backward compatibility are engrained in the culture which manifests itself in the various open source projects. In the ruby world things are simpler to get started with and the surface area of a project is usually smaller and fairly easy to get integrated compared to Java. But ruby projects tend to &quot;rot&quot; much more quickly and aren&#x27;t nearly as strict about compatibility. That&#x27;s probably because Rails, the biggest reason for ruby&#x27;s popularity, is very much about breaking compatibility without a second thought if it means improving the framework.

Would it be okay for the police to come into your home, <i>not touch anything</i>, but just write down a list of everything they see? What if they did this without the bodily intrusion?<p>It <i>is</i> arguable whether or not the Fourth covers this. There are legitimate legal arguments that can be made for its legality. You might not agree with those arguments, and you might not find them convincing, but you can&#x27;t dismiss them just because you don&#x27;t like it. You have to argue that property is, in fact, being seized (which I&#x27;d disagree with you on). You have to argue that &quot;search&quot; is sufficient to meet the standard of the Fourth.

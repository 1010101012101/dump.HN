Since he had well more than 2^5 bits using both hands[1], he was able to assign macros that helped significantly with his effective typing speed.<p>Englebart says that his layout is not intended for speed typing, with the typical trained typer being able to type 30-50wpm.  He observed that typing speed on conventional keyboards does not have a strong correlation with typing speed on his chording layout.  Sight-reading piano players have a bit of an advantage here, of course.<p>I've always wanted one of the Twiddlers, and am kind of excited they're back on the market, but I'd vastly prefer a wireless version.  I've also been looking forward to the release of the FrogPad.  It would be nice to have a better-than-touchscreen keyboard for emails on the iPad or iPhone.<p>[1] I can't remember the exact layout now.

While TC had great value a few years back as a news source, the purchase by AOL was IMO the culmination of a steady decline.<p>I'm not sure if the instigation of flamebait headlines and Gawker level journalism were a natural progression for an expanding media outlet which bases its own self worth on impressions and ad-clicks, or a conscious effort to court the attentions of the big-name acquisitors, but the Techcrunch of 2010 was a noticeable step down from the startup/business related organ of prior years.<p>Viral content spreading via limited-char media such as Twitter is probably encouraging the troll-headline (""Women don't want to run startups""). We know from the AOL Way missives that the major content farms are encouraging Google-Trend following made-to-order 'reporting' rather than seeking out the new.  As TC became the go-to place for 'launch' it has become apparent that cronyism was driving much of the content selection, rather than objective assessment of the startup in question - see Quora vs StackOverflow reporting on TC in recent months.<p>There was a post a few weeks back on HN of someone wanting to produce a successor to TC - a 'back to the old way' site. Whether they will be successful or not, the interesting fact was the public response was overwhelmingly positive, rather than questioning the rationality of pursuing the idea. At the end of the day, it's just a blog. Crunchbase is great, Disrupt is valuable, but if the anchoring blog loses its way, the associated properties will be usurped by someone else.",1298249653

In fact, I find that dynamic programming algorithms are often easier to reinvent than to try to look up in a book. That said, until you understand dynamic programming, it seems like magic.<p>This is especially true if you apply memoization to the naive recursive formulation to obtain an efficient algorithm.<p><a href=""http://clojure.github.com/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/memoize"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.github.com/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#cloj...</a>",1298247454

2243620,comment,2242594,2243480,0,0,euccastro,,,"Python doesn't mandate block structure and indentation in lines within brackets and parens.  Ask yourself why is that and you'll have the reason why it makes sense in Lisp.<p>I'm very familiar with Python and hack occasionally in Scheme.  After a really short time, parens really are no problem.  They are an asset.  In big functions where indentation stops being obvious at a glance (and in smaller ones, what's the problem?), I can more easily see/check the extent of a block in Scheme (with editor paren matching) than in Python.  The editor is better able to help me select and operate on such blocks.  Moving blocks around (e.g. for refactoring) is easier, faster and feels safer.<p>If I still use Python more often than Scheme it has nothing to do with parens.  Much on the contrary, that's one of the reasons I wish I could spend more time in Scheme.",1298247037

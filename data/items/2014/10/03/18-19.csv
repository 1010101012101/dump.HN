The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is involved with many port dredging projects to make the navigable waterways deeper and wider.[1] There has always been an iterative relationship between size/draft of ships and width/depth of waterways -- in fact, the size of many ships the world over is constrained for practical purposes by the size of the Panama Canal.[2]<p>The US government has been improving ports since its early days. In fact, the expenditure of federal funds on &quot;internal improvements&quot; such as port improvements was quite the contentious issue in the early republic.[3] But most of the world&#x27;s trade moves by sea, and the US is and always has been a maritime nation.[4] The ROI for port improvements is laughably high, so it has always been a no-brainer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dqm.usace.army.mil/Education/Index.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dqm.usace.army.mil/Education/Index.aspx</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panamax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panamax</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_improvements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_improvements</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/geopolitics-united-states-part-1-inevitable-empire"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/geopolitics-united-states-p...</a>",1412362738

In that case, the programmability issue is moot; neither the original USB stick nor the rogue one have to have field-programmable firmware. The rogue one is hard-coded at manufacture time to do harm.<p>This is a different issue from white hat USB devices that turn black due to a remote exploit, and it is addressable by some form of trusted computing, like authenticating that USB devices are genuine. With this authentication in place, it&#x27;s possible that there could be remote exploits that somehow retain the device&#x27;s ability to authenticate while changing its behavior.<p>As far as trusting the manufacturer to implement the switch: it is hard to get away from trusting the manufacturer. You&#x27;re plugging in their hardware into your device. Under the assumption that the manufacturer is working in good faith to prevent rogue reprogramming, it is in their interest to implement the switch properly, so it cannot be overridden in software.<p>Basically, the situation is that if someone wants to sell you, say, a rogue keyboard that steals your keystrokes, they can do that without even involving the USB protocol. A keyboard can have its own storage for keystrokes and its own channel for transmitting the information, not involving the USB interface.  For instance, it could have on-board Wi-Fi, and a rogue firmware that finds a free hot-spot, makes a connection and sends its logged data to its &quot;mother ship&quot;.",1412361211

People who like being paid very well and enjoy working interesting and current problems realize this and thus DevOps is a tag that allows these two groups to find eachother. It absolutely gets misused in job titles for visibility, and we don&#x27;t care because it usually doesn&#x27;t mean the company wants a person who knows and does everything (though it certainly happens). It is entirely possible for DevOps to refer to a position, but by the very nature of the contraction, it would be two jobs for one person. Right now we live in a time of sufficient complexity such that in all but the smallest organizations that doesn&#x27;t make sense, and in those organizations job titles are moot anyways.<p>In reality, if you look at the history of the term and the current leadership of the development and discussion around DevOps, it still represents the following core areas: 3rd Order Cybernetics, Agile (Infrastructure + Software Development) and Continuous Delivery. I personally believe it&#x27;s just a simpler way to refer to 3rd Order Cybernetics (3OC will never catch on) and DevOps the term will give way to something that better fits the nature of the movement, but until then, that&#x27;s what DevOps is.

When you ng-bind an attribute of an object, your child scope is not changing the reference to the original object, so both scopes will show updates.<p>Example fiddle: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/02f4o7u9/1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/02f4o7u9/1/</a>",1412361071

They are perfectly real: they just aren&#x27;t elementary.<p>Furthermore, for quasi-particles the atomic lattice of the superconductor acts in the same way as empty space does for elementary particles: it gives them a place to exist and has properties that allow them to move around and interact with each other.

As most products support markdown, if you settle with this, you&#x27;ll be just on of the many (but it is a low-risk choice).<p>WYSIWYG editors are mediocre at best, but may work for blogging UI. The benefit of using these is that you are not really limited and can use any HTML feature. If there is an advance in the editor, the app gets it without much effort. The downside is that it will be HTML only, not much support for pdf or similar output formats, but most bloggers won&#x27;t really care.<p>Asciidoc: This is my choice, because it is easy to version control, and use for various purpose. Generating docbook then HTML is very easy, complex UI structures too.<p>2) Static vs dynamic site:<p>Most blog content is static, yet no blogging platform offers good editor workflow and good static export at the same time. Static content is also faster and cheaper to host, so this is a thing that you can optimize for.<p>If you are planning a hosted service, one idea is to provide the editor workflow as the service, and publish the articles to S3 or similar platforms for hosting.<p>3) Social, comments:<p>For some, social integration and comment system is important. I don&#x27;t mind having a blog without any of these, so it may work. Disqus, livefyre and other javascript-based comment systems are easy to integrate anyway, so if you need these, there are some tools to start with.<p>Sharing button is two-fold. Having an explicit policy that you won&#x27;t help to track your readers through these button could make you apart from the competition, but of course it will provide less &quot;engagement&quot;.<p>4) Tech stack:<p>Almost anything will do. CMS, blogs, websites can be parallelized by design, and even if you start with something monolithic, and got some traffic, it will be easy to scale it later on.",1412360003

Dokku is a solution, but I think it&#x27;s not a strong one in the case of replicating Heroku or just as a wise choice for development; Dokku is fundamentally single-node and is neither fault tolerant nor scalable. Boo-urns. (I dig the `git push` integration, but you can do that a number of different ways that don&#x27;t tie you to something like Dokku.)<p>I can&#x27;t speak to databases, because RDS/ElasticCache/etc. are <i>right there</i> so I don&#x27;t think about it as often as I probably should, but for application-level stuff I&#x27;ve found that Mesos with Marathon (or HubSpot&#x27;s Singularity, which is really cool) addresses this much better, especially with Mesos&#x27;s Docker executors. You also have the advantage of being able to use this cluster differently should you so choose--Marathon lets you run apps as does Daniel&#x27;s Dokku setup, but you can use Chronos as a distributed, fault-tolerant cron system and you can also plug in Slack, ElasticSearch, etc. and reuse the same infrastructure as you need it.<p>It&#x27;s also pretty easy to get rolling with, so I wouldn&#x27;t use difficulty as a factor. =) A little more overhead, but a lot more future-proofing.

If m and a were big numbers, what did that do to f when I pushed it through the equation? If f was big and a was small, what did that do to m? How did the units match on each side? Playing with the equation was like conjugating a verb. I was beginning to intuit that the sparse outlines of the equation were like a metaphorical poem, with all sorts of beautiful symbolic representations embedded within it.<p>I cannot emphasize how useful this approach is. What&#x27;s more, I am very surprised by how many students lack the basic ability to sit and &quot;play around&quot; with math concepts.<p>I used to tutor algebra, trig, and pre-calc. I was surprised by how few students had the ability to look at something and break it into pieces. If you gave them piece A which they knew, piece B which they knew, and put them together, the result was something new the student couldn&#x27;t understand and they&#x27;d sit and wait for an explanation.<p>This was sad because this is largely what math learning is. Given pieces you do understand, you put together bigger pieces and then build an understanding of those bigger pieces.<p>I have always advocated something similar to what what the author said here:<p>> What I had done in learning Russian was to emphasize not just understanding of the language, but fluency. Fluency of something whole like a language requires a kind of familiarity that only repeated and varied interaction with the parts can develop.<p>I love this point. I am borderline convinced it it is near impossible to learn math concepts more than one or two steps beyond the point that you are <i>fluent</i> in. Beyond that, it&#x27;s just memorization, guessing, and poor heuristics that just get you to skate past the test and do little or nothing for understanding or retention.<p>The bigger picture here is that the author has learned how to learn. It amazes me how significant a divide there is between people who know how to learn and people who don&#x27;t. Forget IQ or test scores, I think knowing how to learn is the biggest indicator of how far someone will go in life. So perhaps most of all I love the fact that they began this journey relatively late (most students going through a similar math path would have done in their late teens or very early 20s what the author was doing in their late 20s).",1412359666

Israeli civilians... for a few decades?</i><p>Absolutely not, it&#x27;s wrong and ought to be immediately stopped. It&#x27;s a great question I&#x27;m glad you asked, because I fully understand that it&#x27;s a genuine concern so we have to take it seriously and discuss it. We can&#x27;t waive it away.<p>But let&#x27;s be very clear here, these are the statistics for rocket attacks by Hamas. Please check the link, it&#x27;s a very simple chart.<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/ntFYSsk.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/ntFYSsk.png</a><p>Israeli civilians died in the last 10 years from rocket attacks: 28\nPalestinian children died in 1 month (July 2014): 329\nPalestinian civilians who died in 1 month (July 2014): 1525<p>Just think about that for a second. Then look at Israeli traffic casualties per WEEK, it&#x27;s five. Yes, five. Every week, more people die in traffic, than civilians died from Hamas rockets in all of 2014 including this summer&#x27;s bloody conflict.<p>Just consider that for a moment. This is not a question of merely &#x27;defense&#x27;. It&#x27;s a question of, is it okay to kill hundreds of innocent children, to prevent an annual death toll from happening that barely rivals weekly traffic casualties, when I&#x27;m not willing to stop building illegal settlements and not willing to lift illegal blockades or occupations of another land that could achieve the same goals.<p>Now let me be clear, every single one of those 28 Israeli deaths the past 10 years was one too many. Every single one is a tragedy I wish hadn&#x27;t happened. But in my opinion it in no way can excuse such disproportionate and grotesque murdering of innocent children on such a scale.<p>Especially not when Israel has not exhausted all of its options yet. Under international law no country has the right to defend itself against a force that is resisting a decades long illegal occupation (now de facto annexation) of its land. This &#x27;right to defend itself&#x27; simply does not exist. Feel free to look up the legal standard that supports it, it&#x27;s not there. Israel has a right to defend itself, and it can do so by withdrawing from occupied territories, lifting an illegal blockade and engaging in genuine peace talks in support of the right to self determination of the people of Palestine. But it has continuously disrupted such talks, which isn&#x27;t my opinion, it&#x27;s the opinion of the entire planet, indeed including the US this last time around, hell including president of Israel Peres stating Netanyahu deliberatedly destroyed the peace deal that had already been negotiated.<p>Again, if someone illegally occupies part of your house, controls your doors and windows (exit/entry by land, air and water), controls your fridge (the infamous &#x27;Palestinian diet&#x27;, controls your electricity and water and energy, and announces it will build more settlements, and walks away from peace treaties or sabotages them, this country has NO right to defend itself by international law. Once it reasonably exhausts its diplomatic options (namely the lifting of illegal blockades and occupations and negotations) it has the right to use force as a final measure. You may disagree with the law, but these are the basics facts of international law. These are not controversial facts.",1412359461

There was a utility for generating the documentation strings (it got them right most of the time) and there's a lot to be said for consistency, even if it produces the occasional pointless-looking artefact. The reason this requirement is in the C# style guidelines is because it gives a consistent way of commenting and, of course, allows extraction of documentation and intellisense. I am no drone by any means, but this isn't so insane if you give it some thought.",1354618793
4870315,comment,4870069,4870213,2,0,nwatson,,,"Eclipse has pretty good code-formatting control for Java, quite customizable.  It's very nice in that:<p><pre><code>  * you can elect to turn off formatting for sections of your code\n  * you can save/export your formatting convention in an XML file that looks like this: http://pastebin.com/fKjKRuZg\n  * you can import that code convention into new/other projects\n  * you can select any number of files or projects and choose to apply the formatting to the Java source\n  * the result is very readable\n</code></pre>\nThis might not tie in directly to your source control tool as is but would make taming and standardizing source from multiple developers a bit easier.  As long as every contributor's code eventually is coerced into this form your own/central copy can easily be diff'ed across versions.  Also, you could apply other conventions with other formatters for clients that see things differently.",1354618793
4870314,comment,4870069,4870213,2,0,ygra,,,"This won't work, except for trivial codebases, I guess. Dean Whelton argued a similar thing once [1]. There are always things that resist automated formatting or that are downright destroyed when using it. I use Ctrl+Shift+F or Ctrl+E,D sparingly for that reason. Eclipse has a tendency to mangle Javadoc comments sometimes. Sometimes you're breaking a long method invocation or formula over multiple lines for readability and not exactly at the 80-char boundary, etc.<p>Of course, trivial things like braces on the same or next line or whitespace around operators are solvable that way, but in general, as long as source code is text (and it will remain that way for quite some time). What perpetuates this state is obviously that we have lots of tools that deal with text and very few that deal with more specialised content. In general I find this sad, though, as text is often neither easiest to work with nor most expressive, despite of what diehard Unix users say.<p>What would be really lovely in my eyes woul be a source control tool that actually understood its content and could say ""order of parameters of that function was changed"" or ""method added"", etc. It's sometimes astonishing how the pursuit of optimal diffs masks the intent of a change where an added method diff starts with the closing brace of the previous method, for example.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://welbog.homeip.net/glue/71/Whitespace_is_not_a_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://welbog.homeip.net/glue/71/Whitespace_is_not_a_problem</a>",1354618568

4870302,comment,4870069,4870069,11,0,Patient0,,,"In my first job out from school I worked with a bunch of ex COBOL programmers who were re-writing the system in this new-fangled language called ""C"".<p>One convention was that all ""procedures"" should be prefixed with a name indicating where they were in the call graph of the program.<p>So the main method was always:<p><pre><code>    int main()\n    {\n       a_initialize();\n       b_process();\n       c_shutdown();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe first function called by a_initialize had to be called ""aa_"", then ""ab_"" and so on:<p><pre><code>    void a_initialize()\n    {\n        aa_connect_database();\n        ab_read_accounts();\n        ac_read_ledger();\n        ...\n    }\n\n</code></pre>\nand so on.<p>Of course, sometimes you had to write a function that had to be called from more than one place (strange I know!!)<p>For this, the naming convention ""pzzDDDD"" was used where D was a digit from 0-9. ""p"" for procedure and ""zz"" because these functions didn't belong to any one place in the hierarchy.<p>We had a print out of the ""pzz""s because just the number was hard to remember. But I can still remember a few of them:<p>* pzz0030 was for looking up account information from the database (but also for maintaining this information).<p>* pzz0031 for contracts<p>* pzz0241 I think was for looking up fees and commissions.<p>Most of the ""functions"" had lots of parameters so that they could do different things (modify, update, delete accounts etc.). This soon became unwieldy so eventually you had:<p>* pzz0241_a_setupcharges()<p>* pzz0241_c_cleanup()<p>or something.

Formatting isn't just chrome around the code.<p>Example: In Java, when writing a custom predicate to filter by foos that are bars, I prefer<p><pre><code>        filter(myList, new Predicate<Foo>() {\n            @Override public boolean apply(Foo foo) { return foo.isBar(); } });\n</code></pre>\nto<p><pre><code>        filter(myList, new Predicate<Foo>() {\n            @Override\n            public boolean apply(Foo foo) {\n                return foo.isBar();\n            }\n        });\n</code></pre>\n(filter is statically imported from Collections2 in Guava)<p>especially when there are multiple of them and they line up neatly underneath each other.<p>Any meaningful autoformatter would change the latter to the former, and in the process loose readability.<p>EDIT: Another example would be when using the builder pattern - getting those methods to line up to be neatly readable often takes some none-standard indentation.",1354618116

The second is simply a bad design where the results affected other code in unexpected ways.<p>There have been a few times were code was reverted and having the code merely commented out saved time, time spent cut/pasting from archive. Even with a good CMS keeping commented out code can serve another purpose, knowing what was when and why.

4870290,comment,4869893,4869893,2,0,powatom,,,"The reason people don't give much constructive criticism any more is, in my opinion, largely down to a set of pervasive, poisonous attitudes which affect the tech industry:<p>1: 'Ship early, ship often' is better than 'take your time and get it right'.<p>People need to release what they've got because <i>GASP</i>, somebody else might get there first! People falsely believe that the market decides based on speed to delivery, rather than overall quality. Investors might, but customers do not. There are a lot of sucky projects out there, regardless of the specific reasons WHY they suck. People don't have the time or inclination to actually provide useful criticisms, but they do feel the need to voice their disdain.<p>2: Everyone's a rock-star.<p>If everyone's a rock-star, nobody's a rock-star. The blogosphere is full of high profile developers and tech evangelists telling everyone how great we all are and how those stuffy 'management' types don't know what they're talking about. The developer is the guru, the shaman, the expert. Well, that's just wishful thinking. If you think you're a genius, you're probably not a genius.

4870287,comment,4869465,4869465,1,0,stevejalim,,,"YMMV, but my gut reaction to your five points is:<p>1a) Why do you want it to be paper? And do you mean paper only? If so, my view is that you'd be looking at much lower revenue than if you were open to ebook versions (instead or as well). Don't overrate the prestige of paper these days. I'd rather 10,000 Kindle/PDF readers over 1000 paper-book readers.<p>1b) I've not dealt directly with traditional/print publishers as an on-the-books author (have never found a commission that pays enough to make the time+deadline worthwhile), but experience from dealing with them as a journalist (my previous life) is that there can be some really great people out there at publishers, but you need to find a good 'personality' match between you and the firm. What publishers whose books you have read seem most closely aligned with where your book is ""at"", culturally? If you can't think of any publishers because you haven't read any such books, get reading. If you can't think of any because there doesn't feel like there's a match, you've got a tougher challenge on your hands - self publishing may be the way forward.<p>2) The lack of a track record will make it harder to get publisher attention. Not impossible, but definitely harder. (This is partly why self-publishing is rising in popularity.) You'll need at least a couple of representative sample chapters and a solid synopsis of where this is going for them to get an idea of whether you're a) saying something worth reading and b) capable of expressing it well enough to work as a book. If you've got some kind of pedigree/relevant background/expertise/credibility that will help a lot, but only if you can write well. It may sound cynical, but these are all factors that help mitigate the publisher's risk in taking you on, and that's what really decides whether something gets published or not.<p>You'll also have to see whether the publisher you have in mind accepts unsolicited submissions. Not all of them do.<p>3) ""Will such interviews be difficult for a first-time writer?"" Have you interviewed anyone at all before? If not, practise on friends/family, interviewing them about anything (don't worry about writing/recording - just get used to the interplay.) Experience really helps you think on your feet and change what could be a pro-forma Q&A into a proper, interesting, interview. Doing it on the phone is good for that natural flow, but doing it over email may also work, depending on your question set and how you're planning to write it up.<p>If you're doing it over the phone, record it and transcribe it fully before writing it up. Keep the recordings and that paper record safe. They are your defence if someone challenges what you've written about them. Decide ahead whether you're going to let your interviewees read the resulting copy -- you don't have to, but for this kind of book I think it could be good to avoid inadvertent altered meanings during the write-up and the related fallout, if you're new to this.<p>4) Finding an independent editor is basically hiring a freelancer - lots of options if you google, variable quality unless you're careful [or lucky]. Look at how much money you think you might make from the book (depending on how you choose to publish), then halve that (because every writer over-estimates how much they'll really make) and then see how much of that you want to hand over to an editor, if you can still afford one.<p>You can save yourself some cash by doing as much prep and polish as you can: plan ahead for the structure of your book and its sections, get real friends to read it (not your parents - you need someone totally objective) and suggest changes. Be structured in your 'bug tracking' and keep polishing up to a pre-set number of revisions (else you'll go insane).  If someone says your book is truly perfect, they're lying. But at least they're being nice.<p>5) I've bought 30-page things that call themselves books. I've also got a 600+ page hardback sitting here, waiting to be read. Don't sweat the number of words - focus on making whatever you're writing as useful and engaging as possible.<p>And, along with what danso says about writing a blog to get you started (which sounds like v good advice for someone who sounds relatively inexperienced in all this), check out leanpub.com, which is the most friction-free way to publish I've yet come across, with royalties that are far, far better than any print-book commission I was ever offered.",1354617759

Though I have to say I've never seen a start-up job ad from <i>anywhere</i> that demanded a photo.<p>What I AM trying to say is that 1) a photo obviously serves only the purpose of assisting with job discrimination, and 2) I would think that ""young, innovative"" (my words) start-ups would both not want to discriminate based on irrelevancies for ethical and legal reasons.  I would also think that they'd understand that doing so is counterproductive to actually getting sh*t done.<p>Two anecdotes:  On a recent train trip here in Germany I met a guy who was partner in a small consulting business.  Very smart guy.  Somehow we got on the photo-CV topic and he was astonished that they are unheard of in the States.  He then recounted how in his earlier days, working for some other company, they'd placed an advertisement for an office assistant.  Most of the replies were from women, and he said that all the guys in the office crowded around the stack of resumes to find the one woman who was hottest.  I may be wrong, but in a male-dominated office I find it hard to believe that the ""hotness factor"" was not ultimately a part of the hiring decision, whether or not it was legal.<p>This same guy told me that his company ""wasn't hiring women right now"" due to the risk that a woman employee might choose to have babies.  I was briefly in shock at hearing an employer state  out loud that his company practiced gender-based discrimination.  Obviously, with a photo CV in hand, even if a company was open to hiring women, it could use the photo to try to figure out if a candidate was of childbearing age or not, and reject their applications if so.<p>Nobody here or elsewhere has justified on any basis the need for a photo with a CV.  It's pretty clear to me that it serves but a single purpose: employment discrimination based on appearance, gender, race, and perhaps disability. The fact that it's ""common practice"" is perhaps a remnant of an earlier time when discrimination based on such things was widely and openly accepted, a situation that I'd hope would have changed, especially in the generally-progressive start-up world.",1354617064

And it can work for any type of business, even non-technical businesses and companies with ambitious goals.<p>The ""Lean"" in Lean Startup does not mean ""Don't Spend Money"". It's a reference to Lean Manufacturing, and it's about not wasting resources. Waste in manufacturing come from things like excess inventory, needless movement of people and parts, and excessive defects. In software it's things like developing features users don't want, or onerous release processes.<p>A lot of people think Lean Startup is all about the Minimum Viable Product, and if the project is too ambitious for a little MVP you can't use Lean Startup. But that's not true. The MVP is about testing business assumptions; your leaps of faith.<p>Here is an example of an ambitious project, the kind that will take years to develop:<p>Lets say you want to build something like Google Spanner/F1. A globally consistent database with rich query capabilities and reasonably low latency. Do you release minimal versions to test if people want it? No, you can't. Minimal versions exist. We have globally inconsistent, or rich query, or low latency databases already.<p>You have to do the market research and decide that if you build it there will be a market. Your testing of business assumptions comes later, after you develop it.<p>For example, do you sell it as a hardware appliance? I say that's probably a bad idea, the companies using that sort of database aren't big on proprietary hardware. What about packaging it as proprietary software? Maybe, plenty of companies buy proprietary databases. But banks aren't early adopters (except Deutsche Bank), and you'll miss ""the next Facebook"" during their early development/growth phase. What about releasing it as open source and making money off support and services? I think you'll get the startups using it, and once they grow a little I think enough will pay to make the business profitable.<p>But those are all <i>my business assumptions</i>. Those are the things that need testing. Maybe hardware appliances are what the market really wants. But if they aren't (and you assumed they were) you would be wasting money developing hardware. Maybe it's not tech companies that want this, but actually banks that would love a hardware appliance. Or scientific research institutions with big budgets that are happy to use proprietary software.<p>You can use Lean Startup methodologies in any company and in any part of the development phase.",1354616834

My point is that the military uses propaganda, spread through the mainstream media, to further it's agenda (which I think is bad). Petraeus' image as a straight shooting, old school, unimpeachable hero type was used as a cover for the morally unsavory aspects of our recent wars. It just happens that he was brought down by a very human indiscretion which was revealed through the use of an insecure network.<p>It illustrates that the indiscriminate sharing of information on public networks gives increased transparency into the lives of people, including the rich and powerful. Even if they know how to cover their tracks, they can be exposed through the insecure practices of ""civilians"" with whom they interact.<p>Something that Assange doesn't quite address in the excerpt is that not only do people not care about about secure communications, they actually want their personal information on the ""public"" web. Most people do not have a group of people they would like to communicate with but in a highly secure manner. The exception would be for affairs.<p>Even people working for companies that have requirements for secrecy need low friction method of exchange of information with larger networks of individuals that they don't know well.<p>There are negative consequence to this (specifically the ease with which the govt can spy on its citizens, as Assange points out).<p>But the cost to individuals, and to society, is too high for whatever benefits a widely used ""darknet"" would have. The value of the internet is connecting large numbers of people who are engaged in the various life activities that people do. It is not compatible with secure networks. The porousness is a feature not a bug.<p>I mean really,  what sort of activities would an average person find it useful to use a secure network for? Illicit, illegal, or insurgent. Not a real high demand for this.<p>FWIW, I think what Assange has done with Wikileaks is heroic. I just think his vision of a sort of private internet is impossible. It would have to be based on ""insiders"" and ""outsiders,"" a sort of division in the population.

I feel like if it could work like this it would mitigate a lot the inevitable battles that take place over small things like formatting/etc.  There are obviously things like variable names that it wouldnt be able to solve but at least nobody would be complaining about where Joe put his curly bracket.  I guess you can do something similar with an SVN hook but its hard to get a seamless process.",1354615775

One of my editors could have a moment of weakness and plagiarize my work, but that's never happened in all those years.  However, it was always possible.  Would that merit expulsion on my part?  Or should the punishment be a slap on the wrist and a reminder to exercise better judgment in the future?<p>On the other end, sometimes the person committing the plagiary isn't aware that what they're doing is wrong.  I've seen a lot of it at the writing center, and this happens a lot with (especially east-asian) foreign students.  Here in the US, we teach that individuals should have our own ideas, but in some places, they encourage adopting ideas from great thinkers (understand and make their ideas your own; stand on the shoulder of giants so to speak).  And even with local students, some genuinely don't understand that copy-pasting 2 lines from the wiki is a breach of conduct.<p>In the end, it's much better for these students that you take the time to teach them the hows and whys of avoiding plagiarism.  There are a few bad eggs that will never learn and will consistently plagiarize, and its at that point when expulsion is merited - and probably best for these students, since they probably weren't meant for academia.  However, the majority of students (even the foreign ones) catch on and grow to be very successful academically.<p>Now, I don't know how it's possible any student could have completed all those years of school prior to college without having encountered this lesson.  Our school system truly is dysfunctional.",1354615278

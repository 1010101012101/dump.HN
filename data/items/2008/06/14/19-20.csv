Use that valuable h1 tag (and h2) on every page to tell me something (and Google) about that page - something good and rich.  Don't waste it on my name - or if you do, I should be allowed to say something about myself.  Or there should be something else there.  Just an important tag that I'd hate to waste.<p>2. Your image alt tag for your log needs improvement.  Also a text tag line would be a good thing.<p>3. Set up a custom route and a field in your db where you make a friendly url for all the courses.  ""/course/2"" should be ""/course/how-to-use-brainbank"".  This should also be your page's title ""How to Use BrainBank by _your_name_""<p>Out of curiosity, will the courses be reviewed?  What's stopping me from having you send out something bad for me to anyone who signs up?<p>Ok, the kitchen won't clean itself.",1213473456

217659,comment,217573,217573,0,0,simonw,,,"It Depends. If you're doing something really simple where you know exactly what the HTML you're slotting in to the DOM is going to look like, go with AHAH - it's generally easier to generate HTML snippets on the server-side than the client-side due to JavaScript's poor support for multi-line strings.<p>If you're likely to want to re-use the data service you're building in more than one place, go with JSON. The problem with an AHAH endpoint is that it can only be used for one thing - a JSON endpoint can easily be repurposed for other parts of your application.<p>The only reason to bother with XML is if you're going to be doing HUGE transforms of e.g. a ton of data in to an HTML table, at which point you might want to use client-side XSLT for a speed boost. The vast majority of applications won't need that though, in which case JSON is far more convenient.",1213472095

I'll change that soon<p>* Gotcha<p>* Yep, needs tweaking.<p>* Good idea<p>* Yep, I can't really do more than 4-hr chunks. With the blog, I've intended on keeping it updated daily but that hasn't happened. I will very much be keeping it updated with info as much as I can.<p>I'm planning on making a key change tomorrow based on the usage I've seen today i.e. if someone is not logged in, instead of telling them ""Hey, log in or register"", it will create a temporary user for them with the enrollment... and send them an email saying ""Hey, you enrolled into this course. Click here to activate your account and confirm your enrollment.""<p>After that change is made, I'll write another blog saying ""I lost XXXX number of people who tried to enroll but couldn't because they were not logged in and they didn't register. Here's how I solved the problem...""",1213471321

217647,comment,217440,217560,0,0,sunkencity,,,"I'd say the S60 platform is hopelessly outdated. The phones look the same and are almost functionally the same as they were 4 years ago, just a little bit faster. Why is there no decent browser on any other phone than the iPhone? I think that these new OSes on mobile that are unix based will totally change the mobile phone world because they are enginneered to be computers rather than direct descendants from voice handset.<p>A friend had hanged out with some Ericsson developers he knows and they were laughing at the iphone design. ""It hasn't got any high performance mobile chips"", ""They're designing this phone totally wrong""... Yeah, it's because the phone is no longer a phone, it's a computer. (Hopefully a computer one can install a free OS on and liberate :)",1213470905

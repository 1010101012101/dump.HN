If my eyesight would have been in your range (&quot;can exist without glasses&quot;) I&#x27;m not sure if I would have done the surgery, but being blind without glasses convinced me that looking weird is a far lesser evil.<p>> What was the surgery like? The idea of something going in my eyes always terrified me.<p>I had the same thoughts, but the surgery was completely harmless. The &quot;real&quot; surgery took something like 20 seconds. The doctor said &quot;now we insert the lens&quot;, then it got a bit bright, then dark and then he said &quot;finished&quot; and did the same thing with the other eye. The preparations were far longer. I had to take eye drops for a few days, then on the day of the surgery they have to lay an IV (for safety purposes - the surgery was done in local anesthesia, but there was the option of falling back to general anesthesia if they had to), then they have to attach all the monitoring equipment and so on .. so, the whole surgery was maybe an hour, but the part you would call surgery was very short.<p>Probably interesting: I didn&#x27;t do LASIK, but this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantable_collamer_lens"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantable_collamer_lens</a> - you cannot get LASIK if you are above -8 diopter on one eye (or at least my doctors said they wouldn&#x27;t do it, too risky)",1422437990

Let&#x27;s look at a real example of mass non-vaccination -- the MMR Autism hoax.<p>This involved a real but corrupt scientist who wrote a scientific paper but used faked data and published that paper in a respected medical journal, although they later withdrew it.  That&#x27;s not people believing in Unicorns! That&#x27;s people thinking there&#x27;s some scientific reason not to get that vaccination.  Newspapers with their terrible reporting of science fed that fear.

Remember that Wakefield is still a scientist at that point; that although the paper is retracted you didn&#x27;t know about the faked data.  You have a bunch of your friends worried about whether they should get that vaccine or not, or whether they should get single vaccines instead of MMR. There are starting to be conflicting stories in the newspapers. And then, a group starts a website and members of that group start calling you a fucking idiot for even considering not vaccinating your child. They compare you to flat earthers and Yeti-watchers and alien abduction kooks.  You know you&#x27;re not like that, so already you&#x27;ve started to reject what they&#x27;re saying.  Some of your friends are sympathetic to you, reinforcing your doubts with phrases like &quot;maybe there&#x27;s nothing to it, but look at Bob - he was fine, he got the vaccine, and now he&#x27;s Autistic&quot; or &quot;maybe there isn&#x27;t anything to it but measles isn&#x27;t that bad and do you really want to risk Autism&quot; (and remember weak anecdotal evidence is rife on HN; and at least on HN user has suggested that measles isn&#x27;t that serious).<p>I believe that mockery here pushes people away from information about vaccination and towards misinformation.<p>This example is tricky because of &quot;hindsight bias&quot;. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias</a><p>This is the best document about the crook Andrew Wakefield -

Meaning there is no &quot;database server/process&quot; to run, it gets included into your app server as a library. This means less configuration and maintenance.<p>2. GUN is a graph database. Meaning you can have both relational and document structured data. I&#x27;m not sure if CouchDB has added this yet, last time I checked (several years ago) it was only NoSQL.<p>3. GUN is not stable/production ready yet, and it is javascript only currently. Which is pretty limiting as of now, but that will change later.<p>CouchDB, Riak, Cassandra all try to be master-master, which is good. Unfortunately, in my personal experience, they have also been much more complicated to start using. I&#x27;m hoping gun will be easier to roll with.

8958897,comment,8954814,8956176,0,0,charliefg,,,"That&#x27;s an interesting one - I like the idea of technology allowing a more inclusive society; enhancing mobility to some people to get them to the shops, allow other people to use steps; maybe one day those who wish to regain their sight or maybe get it for the first time. However -- as with everything in nature -- it also has a dark side.<p>First, which is far more a philosophical addition to my previous point - it&#x27;s defining a norm. To some extent this is unavoidable; it is essentially saying that to be at a normal functional level you need sight, be able to walk, etc. So the question is - is a more inclusive society one that is setup for a whole spectrum of people or one that enables people&#x27;s bodies to bring them to a functionally &#x27;equal&#x27; footing? It&#x27;s probably somewhere in the middle.<p>The other part, which I know I&#x27;ve experienced, is that the more unnecessarily engaged I was with technology -- more so with hi-tech -- the more detached I was with the actual world around me. So, for instance, walking around outside listening to music in headphones; walking around outside with a mobile phone (especially a smart phone). Nowadays, unless I have a damn good reason to take it with me (The only one that comes to mind is playing a set), I go around outside with clothes and maybe bags and leave everything else at home. On the rare occasion I&#x27;ve found that a mobile phone might have been useful, but those occasions are mainly when I&#x27;ve relied on a car to take me beyond walking distance. The cycle of reliance.<p>Since placing this limit on myself, It&#x27;s challenged me to be more engaged with the environment around me, more mindful in myself and I&#x27;ve found this has made me much happier and my environment more colourful. Trying to strike the balance is good, and I enjoy walking the tight rope. However cyborg bodies starts entering a whole new domain - the idea of being chained to technology because it&#x27;s a part of my body seems horrible to me; there would be no relief from it.<p>If people want society to go that way, fair enough. However, I personally won&#x27;t encourage unnecessary integration with bodies because that&#x27;s not the world I want to live in.",1422437178

And, of course, the carriers don&#x27;t subsidize upgrade cycles as they do with phones.<p>Being able to share data plans with phones at nominal cost would be one interesting upgrade driver but that&#x27;s really in the hands of the carriers and is unlikely.<p>The other interesting possibility across both Macbook and iPad lines would be some sort of reconvergence of tablet and laptop experience but Apple got to where it is by doing the precise opposite so I&#x27;m not sure Apple feels a big impetus to shift up the playing field right now. (Microsoft OTOH has been trying to parlay its desktop strength with tablets that are more tightly coupled but with somewhat limited success--to say nothing of the fact that Windows 8 was largely a product of this thinking.)",1422436213

Glad to have read it.<p>Meanwhile I think the hiring problem/solution is staring us right in the face.<p>What would the world be like if contract/freelance/part time/short term work were the default?<p>Isn&#x27;t it perhaps weird that there is an assumption companies and employees should bind their fates together, and, if it doesn&#x27;t work out, one or both parties is pretty screwed because of an investment of time and money which will likely result in a person being unemployed and/or a company paying a person far beyond when they are providing value.<p>This is like getting married after one date. Every time.<p>If employees were assumed to be exploring many things simultaneously, both sides would have plenty of chances to gather meaningful data about the employer/employee relationship, and if it is really a great fit, a long term employment arrangement could be worked out, with a contract that reflects mutual responsibilities revolving around this shift to an all-eggs-in-one-basket situation for the employee - and likely a corresponding move to much more critical functions being performed for the company.<p>I cynically suspect the current concept of full-time work evolved to suit employers, it allows them to manipulate and scare employees, especially when (for example) health insurance is at stake. Employers naturally have more data about salaries and so forth, in general most employers have many employees, while most employees only have one employer. That is inherently asymmetrical. Now that certain skill sets are harder to hire for, it is hurting everyone.<p>But the situation was never that great from the beginning, let&#x27;s figure out a way to make it better for everyone.",1422436090

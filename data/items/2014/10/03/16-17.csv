Airports are far away from a city center, and there&#x27;s always lines for security.<p>I rode Amtrak Cascades[1] from Seattle to Portland a few weeks back and the train station is only a few blocks from the city center. Leg room resembles first class on a plane, and being able to walk around and sit in an observation/dining car is better than anything. \nFour hours, $50.

8406300,comment,8404414,8405897,1,0,EGreg,,,"Hamas did win the elections in 06 - I followed them and they won on a platform of promising better social programs thantheir opponents.<p>That was um - 8 years ago. In the immediate aftermath their actions drew sanctions from the US, EU, UN and Russia, on the entire Palestinian Authority, and they wound up splitting from the unified government and taking over Gaza. That led to the sanctions being lifted against the PA and imposed on Gaza alone. Then they had a civil war with Fatah  over control of Gaza (which to be fair was just as much if not more Fatah&#x27;s initiative) and wound up killing and expelling the rival Fatah government members from Gaza entirely. After this, a blockade was imposed on Gaza by both Israel and Egypt, as Hamas secured its iron grip on Gaza and routinely affirmed its ideological goal to &quot;liberate&quot; Palestine from the Zionists - a completely impractical diplomatic position that harmed the Gaza population enormously for the next decade.<p>Not that Hamas was too concerned about that. They were getting funding from Islamic states and went to work securing the Gaza strip and consolidating its power. To its credit, Gaza is tribal (the clans are called Hamullas) and it plunged into anarchy in the aftermath of Israeli withdrawal and resettlement of all Israelis from the Gaza strip. You can appreciate the situation preceding these elections by reading some news articles from the time:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/17/international/middleeast/17mideast.html?pagewanted=print"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/17/international/middleeast/1...</a><p>It is in this environment that Hamas, an organization committed to an ideology that it placed above the lives of Israelis and indeed Gazans - came to prominence. Since that election there have been no fair and free elections. I don&#x27;t think the mark of a democracy is that they have one election and the majority party drive out the rest of the government and maintain an iron grip for the next couple decades. They are closer to the Kim regime in North Korea. Hamas&#x27;s governancd has been terrible for the Gazans by perpetuating their blockade, and Hamas itself has become almost completely internationally isolated. In this latest war, an unprecedented number of nations including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and UAE have joined the chorus calling for their disarmament.<p>So I would take issue with the idea that Hamas is somehow a legitimate and good government for the people of Gaza. Before this war, most of them wanted to get rid of Hamas! Having said that, operations like this cause people to support Hamas who they now would elect over Fatah leaders if elections were held today. This itself is sad because as has been shown over and over Hamas perpetuates the suffering of Palestinians. Not just because of international sanctions and nearbcomplete isolation, and not just because of expanding Sunni Sharia which hurts less Islamically religious Palestinians including Christians, etc. but at the root because they put their ideology ahead of human lives. Any ideology in power - whether nazism, communism, or in this case a fanatical belief that &quot;All Palestine is a waqf to Islam until the end of the world&quot; which is in their charter - leads to mass death. After all technically speaking Hitler may have been democratically elected. So we should guard against this.<p>Having said that, I think Revisionist Zionism is the ideology that empowers the radicals on the Palestinian side, whether religious or not. Not all Zionism but Revisionist zionism, which traces its roots to Jabotinsky but ultimately found expression in such groups as Lehi and Irgun. Menachem Begin was despised by the main leaders of Israel such as Ben Gurion and the entire Labor party. It is interesting to note that at that time Israel was within the &quot;1967 lines&quot; and got even more threats from various Arab countries, that said they shouldn&#x27;t have a state at all. Besides launching actul military attacks against Israel, many Arab countries also expelled Jews (a sort of Jewish Nakba, the main difference being that Jews had a state that welcomed them, a state which the Arab League nations wanted to destroy without regard to how many people lived in it).<p>Not many people talk about this but the expelled Jews were able to find a home in Israel and swell its population. In fact most Jews in Israel came to Israel as refugees - whether from the Holocaust in Europe or the expulsion from Arab countries BEFORE 1967. Some went to Israel, others went to the US, China and Western countries. They were able to get asylum and their children have become citizens!<p>Meanwhile millions of Palestinian refugees do not get the same treatment, even and especially from the Arab League countries that are supposedly championing their &quot;cause&quot; to begin with!<p>Their actual treatment by these countries is appalling. Did you know that over half of the people considered &quot;Palestinian&quot; live OUTSIDE Israel, te West Bank and Gaza? For GENERATIONS they have lived as refugees with NO citizenship. Think about that - you live in a segregated &quot;refugee camp&quot; and barred (in countries such as Lebanon) from owning property or holding many jobs (doctor, lawyer etc.) Your children born in the land - no matter how many generations - do not get citizenship and spend their lives in the same situation.<p>This is ACTUAL apartheid and it has been artificially perpetuated by many Arab League countries, while claiming it is for their own good. It&#x27;s not a joke, the Jordanian govt has consistently said this as a talking point as recently as in the last decade. They refuse to give asylum specifically to Palestinians - even the ones fleeing the civil war in Syria. They simply drive them back over the border (whatever the UN conventions about that may be.<p>There is an element of realpolitik here that most Western &quot;free Gaza&quot; protestors miss. Arab countries HAVE tried to take in Palestinians but experienced their own problems with the PLO. This idea that Palestinians should have their own state has played out in more theaters than Israel. The Jordanian government had a civil war with the PLO after it annexed the West Bank and it does not want to go back to that dark time again. Kuwait expelled Palestinians because the PLO sided with Saddam in the Gulf war. Lebanon&#x27;s Hezbollah formed out of a Shiite minority funded by Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran as much against the influx of Sunni Palestinians (the PLO was based IN Lebanon at the time) as the Israeli army&#x27;s activities in Lebanon. And just as recently as last year, Assad committed genuine war crimes against his Palestinian population living in refugee camps, such as cutting off food and starving tens of thousand of Palestinians in a camp that used to be the largest one in Syria with hundreds of thousands.<p><a href=""http://www.timesofisrael.com/three-years-of-civil-war-in-syria-no-end-in-sight/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timesofisrael.com/three-years-of-civil-war-in-syr...</a><p>So instead of the neatly packaged narrative of &quot;Israel vs Palestinians&quot; look at it as people, governments and ideas. How many millions of people and their generations of children living in Arab countries have to suffer because of the excuse that the policy supports building a Palestinian state in Palestine? Imagine if Jews were told by European nations that they had to live in 21st century ghettos for as many generations as it took until Israel was established. Not even the USSR - a militantly atheistic country - treated them this badly. Palestinian nationalism wasnt even a dominant movement until the PLO, and like all movements to forma state and get power, the PLO had its share of corruption. But millions of Palestinians have to pay the price, not at Israel&#x27;s hands but other countries as well. Actualy, arguably speaking the Palestinians who live in Israel proper have the same quality of life as in Western countries such as Canada where they have real opportunities (the singer Nasri for example, whose song is currently topping the charts, is of Palestinian descent). And if they get their own state, there are legitimate reasons to worry it won&#x27;t be very tolerant of Jews, Christians and will most likely be a Sunni Sharia state.<p>So I guess there is a point to my whole essay that I wound up writing here. Look at people, look at governments and international coalitions and talk about ways those those governments can work together to benefit the people at large, economy, real infrastructure, and protections for minorities. There are no easy solutions but if international programs are put in place, with a realistic roadmap and accountability, and governments each do their part, we can solve these problems brick by brick. Expecting Israel to do it all alone is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Look at the new geopolitical alliances in the Arab and Persian world because of ideological jihadist threats like ISIS, look at te unprecedented will to disarm Hamas, and start there. Let&#x27;s start helping people.<p><a href=""http://magarshak.com/blog/?p=172"" rel=""nofollow"">http://magarshak.com/blog/?p=172</a><p><a href=""http://magarshak.com/blog/?p=174"" rel=""nofollow"">http://magarshak.com/blog/?p=174</a>",1412354907

Not only but two war ships sold by France to Russia, sitting in EU harbours, continued onward with their training of Russian solders.

These were the &quot;upper level&quot; math classes too.<p>This situation was actually pretty terrible. My classmates and I hated this setup and most of us were barely learning the material, those of us who did figure it out usually had to teach those around us since the teacher wasn&#x27;t. During this time my math grades were low compared to my normal grades, mostly in the B to D range.<p>Eventually, I found a teacher who would spend class teaching instead of having us work on &quot;homework&quot; the whole time. We would go over all of the relevant theories to the chapter for a few days, showing us, in a way that most of us could understand, mostly how they worked but without getting too in depth.

But I&#x27;ve just gotta vent at how embarrassing and seemingly inept the train system is in my country.<p>This very morning I went to pick up a friend who was riding Chicago to Pittsburgh. The train was due to arrive at 5:00 AM, giving me plenty of time to get her home and get myself to work by 8:00. But knowing how these things tend to unfold, I was savvy: I told my boss that I might not be in until 9:30 or so, giving myself enough headroom to breathe even if the train was an unthinkable three hours late.<p>I was naive. The train was <i>five</i> hours late.<p>Meanwhile, I have friends who work for companies who write the software that control train scheduling throughout the country. After what they&#x27;ve seen, they refuse to ride on trains, and from the stories they&#x27;ve told I don&#x27;t blame them.<p>It&#x27;s easy to attempt to excuse this state of affairs.

Those in high-risk, high-sensitivity situations should assume that a “secure-erase” of a card is insufficient to guarantee the complete erasure of sensitive data.

We didn&#x27;t drop the cities anywhere - they sprang up, first in town-form, then counties and eventually cities. It&#x27;s very hard to find a european-style city center in America. Perhaps if we were split into 30 countries and had a millenia or two of history there&#x27;d be more clearly defined and planned-out cities, but we&#x27;re kind of an ad-hoc do-it-yourself baby nation. That said, if you&#x27;re near the water there&#x27;s bound to be a town nearby.",1412352158

Some people find keyboard navigation through a second buffer that pops up on the bottom to be not-good. I&#x27;m one of those people. I <i>hate</i> it when completion buffers, or anything related to a second buffer, pops up in my frame.<p>Google Chrome, or any modern browser for that matter, has a much better way of doing things. Imagine for a moment that I was browsing and editing code in Google Chrome instead. A symbol would be a link, and when I ctrl+clicked on it, it would open in a new frame. That would be an interface I could get behind.<p>For completion, it ought to work like the IDE I used back when I was writing Scala. A little tooltip would pop up with completions. You could scroll through them with the mouse or keyboard, and click or ENTER the one you want and it would paste in. Or you could ignore it completely and continue typing. This sort of UI is so much better than popping up a new buffer in the frame. But in Emacs UI, everything is a buffer and there are only three places they can (or usually do) go: in a new frame, in a new window, or in the minibuffer. Only that last one is usable.<p>GNU global is not a solution. It produces marginally better output than etags, but still requires you to actually run it whenever you make changes to the codebase. Or at least it did back when I tried it as an etags replacement.",1412352094

For example, I will often open a new tab to create a sort of &quot;checkpoint&quot;, resulting in 5 tabs that represent different points in time in a browsing session. Other times I will open 5 pages that are analogous to each other in order to compare (for example, 5 similar products on Amazon). Other times it&#x27;s a method of &quot;forking&quot; a browsing session into several different paths, while keeping the parent node in its own tab.<p>Not really proposing solutions here, but it does make tabs look a bit clunky.<p>Side note: For the last few months, I&#x27;ve been using a Chrome plugin that prevents me from opening more than a predetermined number of tabs at a time.

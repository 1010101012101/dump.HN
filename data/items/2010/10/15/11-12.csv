However Facebook felt the need to borrow Twitters @replies (<a href=""http://mashable.com/2009/09/10/facebook-mentions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2009/09/10/facebook-mentions/</a>) so why can't Twitter borrow the Facebook like.<p>Yes they are different sites and yes they serve different purposes. However if functionality can work on both and can aid the users of that site then why should it not be introuced - just because you can already do it on one is not a good enough reason. If it was then you would not see competitors coming out daily with new sites that do what existing sites do but try and better it.<p>Twitter has millions of users who do not have a Facebook account and vice-versa. Providing they don't move too much from what makes them unique then giving their user base useful features can only be a good thing.",1287143768

1794270,comment,1792181,1792327,0,0,hagy,,,"A few comments here have discussed microwaves influencing biochemistry by non-ionizing mechanisms. To address these concerns, it’s easy to show that microwaves cannot provide enough energy to alter any biochemical pathway unless one imagines a very specific molecular system to absorb energy at this wavelength; similar to chlorophyll absorbing visible light in photosynthesis.<p>Given the complexity of chlorophyll and its significant support system in photosynthesis, I would highly doubt such a similarly complex molecular system would evade discovery.  Further, due to the weak energy of microwaves, as quantified next, such a microwave harvesting system would have to be located at the surface of our skin (or other periphery tissue like hair) to absorb this energy before other biomolecules absorb it non-specifically.  I believe these relatively simple periphery tissues have been exhaustively studied.<p>As the article mentions, microwave energy is on the order of 0.001 kJ/mole.  Just to put that in perspective, the random thermal (kinetic) energy contained in each degree of freedom of a biochemical systems is on the order of 2.5 kJ/mole.  Due to their weak energy, microwaves have only been shown to non-trivially interact with molecular systems in the gas phase, where collisions between molecules are suppressed, as each molecular collision occurs with enough energy (thermal energy) to overwhelm the much weaker microwave interactions.  In the fluid tissues of the body this energy would only be non-specifically absorbed causing a trivial and temporary rise in temperature (1e-4 deg C) within the tissue.<p>Therefore, I highly doubt microwaves interact with human biochemistry in any interesting or pathology-relevant way.",1287143564

I could have just as easily updated this status on Twitter.<p>Around 4 hours later I logged into Facebook and to my amazement 9 people had liked my status. They didn't comment but were clearly happy that Ellie had had the baby and felt compelled 'to like'.<p>This got me to thinking - why is there not a 'like' button on Twitter. I know you can Retweet but some of the friends who liked my status have a different set of friends to me and so if they would have posted the news on their Facebook stream it would have meant nothing to anybody.<p>The amount of times I see good news on Twitter and think 'yeah that is cool' if I see it on Facebook I can like it and that person (however sad this may be) is pleased because they have brightened up someones day.<p>If Twitter introduced 'like' I would use it.

7617501,comment,7616708,7616708,1,0,cjo,,,"This article reads like the author is just mad at some audiophile for being a jerk about their vinyl collection.  Fair enough, but it&#x27;s kind of straw-manning vinyl collectors.<p>Implying that CDs give you forensic level exact playback while vinyl is &quot;messing up&quot; the sound? That&#x27;s ridiculous.  If nothing else, digital music has to make the trip from analog to digital (ADC) and then digital to analog (DAC) and neither of these are trivial steps.  Lavry Blue&#x27;s cost $2500 and that&#x27;s just for analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion of one stereo signal, no pre-amps or anything else.  In fact, mastering engineers might spend up to $8500 for two channels of digital to analog conversion.<p>I&#x27;ve done sound engineering in the past; I love digital, I think digital has done great things for music and I think the sound quality is excellent.  But there&#x27;s a reason that 8-tracks came and went, cassette tapes came and went, CDs are on their way out, but vinyl is still hanging on.",1398013138

There is such a jungle of code that can only be justified by the desire for more features, more portability (to crazy ancient platforms too), more speed, more flexibility... it&#x27;s all more knobs and code where real security bugs can lurk.  And code paths that do not get tested properly.  You can also find many outright dangerous idioms used throughout.  Does that mean the upstream is ignorant, or that they do not care, or that they do not have the man power to fix their aging code?  Either way, it&#x27;s bad.<p>The OpenBSD developers have different priorities, and they believe they can do better.  As such, not being able to blindly pull changes and updates from the <i>upstream developers they do not trust</i> does not look like a significant loss.  If new features are to be merged in, it has to be properly reviewed and adapted.  Yes, it&#x27;s more work that way.  But the end result is likely better code.",1398013017

7617482,comment,7616803,7616803,0,0,zackmorris,,,"I would like to see the middleware between sensors and motors be open source.  To me, it seems like the complexity in prosthetics is not the mechanics, but interpreting the signals properly to control the device.<p>It seems like a relatively rudimentary neural net with a lot more electrical sensors than today (maybe 16 to 256, something on that order) combined with some of the new sensors like light transmission or even maybe ultrasound to &quot;see&quot; the muscles under the skin, could be mapped to a graph with roughly the same degrees of freedom as the human hand.<p>Then maybe something like KNN could sift the data and map it to the motors.  I’m not very familiar with data mining yet, but surely a lot could be done with a 700 MHz Raspberry Pie and a few GB of SSD storage.  I’m thinking that giving the algorithm some notion of time by recording 1/60 of a second slices or something in that range might really improve accuracy.  Just throw data and processing at it rather than trying to fully understand how nerves work.<p>Doing the reverse, to stimulate nerves based on how much power each motor is using, should be simpler.  It could be sloppier because the human mind would learn to interpret the signals better than a computer.<p>The software should be available for free online and work with commodity hardware, and then the prosthetic designer could customize the limb for each user.  Plus it could have the ability to upload random samples to help train the next generation AI.<p>As long as I am dreaming, we also need a moonshot to standardize nerve implants.  It would go inside the limb somewhere and then use something like 802.11 powered by inductance coils above and beneath the skin, with a faraday cage built into the arm to prevent interference.  Actually now that I say that, I wonder if the noise produced by the body’s movements would be statistically significant enough for another input into a neural net.<p>Anyway, chemical markers on the terminals could urge the nerves to grow into the terminals.  Or use a bit of foreign nerve tissue that’s been grown on a scaffolding in the device in the lab, and then implant it and put the patient on immune suppression drugs until the nerves grow together, and then take them off gradually until the body dissolves the foreign nerves and has a direct connection to the sensor.  Another idea would be to press a comb-shaped device with hundreds of microscopic channels through the nerve bundle and read the voltage through each channel.  It should be manufactured for longevity and to read the most amount of data possible, and just let the programmers work out how to sift through it.<p>Once we had good data, training a neural net to do the mapping to actuators seems like a basic problem.  Like maybe sample a few hours’ worth of movements and put the whole thing online like the Netflix contest until someone has programmed a near-perfect AI.  Or a series of contests, each aiming to raise accuracy by 10% or something.",1398012922

We have access to so much information and so many resources that there&#x27;s rarely any valid excuse not to become what you want to be.

The very first version of my startup was something that was pretty much the same system, but we focused on offloading liquidation inventory. Some things that you will likely discover along the path<p>1. If you use eBay as your dataset, you are pretty much SOL. Their lack of rigorous moderation in terms of their image style guide makes computer vision really, really difficult to carry out. Using SIFT image features from <i>the same exact images</i>, I only got about a ~75% accuracy because eBay users tend to slap all types of random extra things onto their images. I can&#x27;t imagine you&#x27;d have much success trying to use CV for identifying (with sufficient accuracy) consumer electronics in consumer supplied photos. I can&#x27;t speak for Mechanical Turk... We wound up modifying our tech strategy such that we didn&#x27;t need high accuracy in identifying other listings.<p>2. Product versions dramatically alter product value, but are just about impossible to figure out without being explicitly provided that data by the person holding the product.<p>3. Unless you own your own sales channel, you will be beholden to the marketplaces to offload the inventory in. In my case, we automated the process of selling on both eBay and Amazon. We were reading in data from multiple wholesalers (dropshippers), which had catalogs full of an arbitrary assortment of products... Which means we wound up listing weapons, sexual objects, etc. We got dinged pretty bad by eBay for these things (though, turns out batons sell <i>really</i> well on eBay). Eventually we pretty much got banned from both marketplaces for listing violations + bad fulfillment speed. We couldn&#x27;t control the shipping speed of our dropshippers (we had no bargaining power), which I attribute to killing that section of the business.<p>As somebody who actually built the same system that you&#x27;re describing (sans being an open marketplace, which actually makes it <i>more</i> difficult), I can say that you&#x27;re in for a rough fight.

I think it should be demonstrable that for a turing machine, for a size-bound input state space, there is a data bus width (with matching eprom and register) for this kind of machine, so that it emulated the said Turing machine. Also, the eprom is a non-invertible function, but there again is always a wider bus, register and eprom, this time with a reversible (injective) action, that would have, nontrivially, equivalent behaviour. In this reversible case, the action of the eprom could be expressed in terms of a unitary transformation acting on a quantum register, so the traces of the register values against time would be a subset of the valid quantum state dynamical trajectories. In this case the two I/O chips below are not required, and the system would evolve autonomously after an initial state. So look, this computer is a cousin of a quantum circuit.",1398012365

This is really my biggest objection with open source: if you want to use it as some sort of resume, then you have to contribute huge amounts of time to it in order to make it representative of your skill. Then it&#x27;s no longer an open source project you do for fun, but just a second day job. Additionally, when it gets good enough for an employer to see, what interviewer is going to have time to read through it?

That would give them &quot;substantial non-infringing use&quot; [2]. And if somebody else published instructions on how to change the configs so you&#x27;d <i>also</i> get Hollywood&#x27;s finest, well, that wouldn&#x27;t be their fault.

The idea of equity (in the form of options) is the company avoids paying as much up front as they might otherwise, in exchange for a stake in the company&#x27;s future. If you turn down the future stake, you may signal that you don&#x27;t think the company has a reliable future, or you may be taken as a pragmatist -- it depends on the individual to whom you speak.<p>Obviously the extreme would be a company that only offers options, no salary -- there&#x27;s a cut-off point where no one will take them up on their offer. And remember to look at this from the opposite perspective -- the company wants to attract intelligent, creative people, the kind that might understand options too well to want them.

Since many of us are working on new stuff at the same time, and we don't want to work in master where our work could conflict, but we do want to see each other's changes. Thus, we make branches on that same server which we all track - these are what I mean by public branches.<p>So, basically this is how I'll work:<p>* Pick a bug out of the bug tracker<p>* make a public branch of the current master and call it [name]-fix-[bug #] or [name]-[new feature]<p>* push fixes/development to that public branch<p>* ask a coworker to review the branch for merge (this is easy, since it's a public branch they're tracking already)<p>* make any changes they recommend, rinse and repeat<p>* merge the public branch into master and push it to the remote repository<p>The problem with redmine is that it only tracks the master branch, not any of those feature branches that me and my coworkers are working on, whereas github shows them admirably, e.g.: <a href=""http://github.com/rails/rails/network"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/rails/rails/network</a> .<p>I love git, but redmine is basically unable to cope with the way we work.<p>Oh and if you want to work this way, this script is invaluable: <a href=""http://git-wt-commit.rubyforge.org/git-publish-branch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git-wt-commit.rubyforge.org/git-publish-branch</a>",1244685428

652170,comment,651965,652079,0,0,mdasen,,,"It really depends on the question.<p>From the article: ""what is a class?"" can easily be answered as a definition from a Google search, but that definition doesn't help you write a class, use a class, etc.  Similarly, you can search for a definition of a join, but if you can't come up with an answer off the top of your head, you don't have the skill to use a join.<p>This is different from, say, being asked what the ""succ"" method of the Ruby Integer class does.  Or, the preg_replace in PHP takes 5 parameters, which position do you place the subject string in?<p>Those are two different types of questions.  The first paragraph has questions about key computer science/database topics that, if you don't know, it will take learning and mastery to use them in a practical application.  The second paragraph has questions of an arbitrary nature - knowing argument order in one language doesn't prove you understand regular expressions nor does knowing what a somewhat ambiguously named method does - especially a method that is also called ""next"" and can be accomplished as ""var += 1"" both of which seem clearer.<p>But there definitely are some things that can be answered by searching that don't necessarily mean that the person has a mastery of the topic that would be required to actually use the definition.  Now, the second set of questions might be a clue that this isn't a good place to work since they emphasize random knowledge that doesn't actually prove any competency, but that's another story.",1244685400

The only tangent I can draw to this is the story about the cop tazing the grandma(""you didn't need to"" , ""oh i was following procedures"")<p>It's not like another distribution stole this logo and used it to get traction based on Arch Linux? It's a small business owner who used it as a 'casual' download-and-use-it manner..and He used the logo for his Ace Driving school - which was clearly displayed on the car. It was not the case that He was a pirated software distributor taking advantage of the Arch Linux logo.\nHe was a layman - oblivious to online copyrights. He saw it on the web,liked it and used it. simple from his point of view. I am sure he knew about copyrights and other issues - but related to 'paper' business.<p>There are bigger stories of people deliberately stealing photos/digital art. There was this one story about this big designer who downloaded a creative-design from an artist's flickr account for a new designer shirt. This artist only came to know of it when he visited this showroom to buy one. Then there are always stories of magazines/newspapers flicking photos from flickr without proper attribution. (i don't recall the links, nor am i going to spend time searching for them - atleast now)<p>I am not contending the fact that he didn't steal the logo or he didn't lie.

How do you ever make enough money to cover your gas/transportation costs AND have enough left over to make this more worthwhile than just getting a $5.00/hr job?<p>You're going to gross about $3.00/load after paying the laundromat, and will probably net out about $1.50-$2.00/load if you outsource the actual laundry (the other costs going to vehicle overhead, small marketing dollars, etc.).<p>If you DIY, it's probably pretty close to the same numbers (you might fit 2 students worth of laundry in 1 washing/drying cycle, but you'll have to buy some of those netted laundry bags to keep the clothes separated.)

One thing I learned through hard experience with Prosper: there is a reason banks are banks.<p>#3, That 2% delinquency rate is, how do I put this gently, creative accounting.  Kiva's lending partners routinely do things like rolling over loans to avoid having to tarnish their near-perfect records -- the original $100 loan isn't four years past due, it is a $500 loan now which is paying as agreed (to the new, updated terms).  They also use collection tactics that in the US would be illegal (you know all those social pressure things, you'd better repay the loan for your chicken or we'll tell your cousin you cost him the loan for his cow?  That has been done here before.  Legislatures were not neutral about the practice, which is why we have laws like the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which prohibits 3rd party disclosure of the fact of indebtedness, to say nothing of asking someone's cousin to be your enforcer.  The FDCPA might not apply directly to Kiva's partners, but similar laws exist in all 50 states.)<p>The triple digit interest rates that some international Kiva parters charge, to compensate for the we-can't-call-it-default-risk, also probably won't fly that well here.  Bad news: it isn't automatically profitable to give loans to poor people at normal US credit card interest rates.  As mentioned previously, there is a reason banks are banks.  Look at Prosper defaults on business loans -- off the top of my head, in the lower credit grades they exceeded <i>forty percent</i>.",1244683375

They're typically made by a couple guys over a few months. That's why the typical app per-unit price is so low compared to the typical app-per unit price for desktop software. In the case of a ""AAA"" title, we're likely talking about something that's multi-platform anyway...code is generally cheap, art assets and design is expensive. A great example, Plants vs. Zombies for desktops is $20, for the iPhone it's what...$4?

Instead of being overwhelmed with a lot of tasks it gives you one to complete, only one.<p>Also, unlike a todo list, a ""chore"" only requires 3 inputs: 1, Name; 2, Description; 3, re-occuring{yes/no}.

For example, a domain name company might give discounts to users who give back meaningful feedback on domain name proposals from other users.",1173121125

There hasn't been anything really great yet, so we'll have to see how SocialURL does. <p>With so many serve options cropping up at rapid rates, whoever truly solves the problem of getting your identity together has a hit on their hands.<p>I've mentioned OpenID in some discussions on here... now I'm talking about taking it a step further.",1173120744

I wouldn't be surprised if they held out for quite a while longer.<p>Kevin Rose seems to be putting a lot of energy into Revision3 right now. Seeing as Digg is a integral part of some of their productions, I think they'd like to retain control.",1173119580

2386,comment,2195,2195,0,0,immad,,,"When you have a lot of committed users that frequent its always possible to come up with strategies that dont involve just the normal advertising channels. e.g. suicidegirls sells branded merchandise and bebo is getting into parnerships with amazon and ebay. So this article is a bit simplistic and I think you could make $50m revenues with a lot less users than it dictates.",1173118597

This is the main idea behind Getting Things Done.<p>I think news.yc is truly on the forefront of procrastination technology. It's the ultimate in infotainment, because you aren't getting anything done but yet there is something about it that makes you feel not completely unproductive.<p>I think this is a good principle for evil web startups to incorporate. Trying to get the same entertainment and addictiveness of WoW, but with less of the feeling of wasting your life (even though you are).",1173117645

Your expectations are clearly pretty extreme.<p>The interesting point here is that Google's software does work on the hardware we're talking about.  So is Google or Microsoft obligated to give you software for free?  Obviously they are not.  But even more interesting, Google's software is already free and available!  So the question then becomes are the manufacturers obligated to modify it to run on your hardware and give it to you?  Well are they?  If they are, take it up with them.

It's a cool job, but I'm generally pretty overloaded and usually underpaid. I don't do it for the cash or free time, that's for sure, but I do love making a difference for our customers. In a strange way I took this approach to 44Con. Everything I do at 44Con is about making sure the delegates have a good time and learn something. If we need to put leaflets on seats, I'm out there. If a delegate has a problem, I want to know so I can fix it.<p>A large part of startup success seems to be sales, but we shouldn't undersell the delivery and relationship aspects. If your customer is struggling to deal with you, then you're doing it wrong. If your customer has problems that you just can't fix, you're doing it wrong.<p>I'll be the first to admit I've failed on both parts on occasion, sometimes simultaneously, but it's our ability to learn from these things that sets the smaller guys apart from the bigger.<p>I'm the equivalent of a CEO at Mandalorian, but I'll proudly clean toilets if it makes for a better experience.",1340837855

My sleep debt grew, and I spent so much time calculating the logistics of how I could get everything done and ""catch up"" on sleep that I think I got less sleep overall and of the same low quality (e.g. 4+12 != 8+8).<p>Then the WakeMate arrived, and all it did was add more numbers, and a new headache to deal with in the morning.<p>This would appear to solve that problem by making specific recommendations, but then what about when I inevitably do not fall asleep at the optimum time?

If it did there would be no need for this.<p>I'm not sure you really need multiple algorithms, the algorithm itself isn't anything special as far as I know - it just supports transparency that's all.<p>You can get somewhat similar results by selecting all the transparent and partially transparent parts and saving the selection. Then flatten the image (i.e. mix the transparency into the background color), reduce the color depth, then use the color to alpha option only on the selection (not the whole image) to subtract the color and bring back the transparency.<p>Then count how many colors you have, if you have too many, undo everything, and choose a lower number for color depth and try again.

Learning a language is one of the most enriching experiences I can think of, and hackers looking for lifehacks to keep themselves challenged should look no further.<p>Think about it: daily life instantly becomes gamified, a game of improving your language skills. You just have to make sure you set the scene: detach yourself a bit from the expat crowd (find local roommates for example). And then you throw yourself at it, not caring that you dont know much in the beginning.<p>Especially the first year is super exhilirating: the first parties where you talk but that language, the first time you do a presentation, the first time you have a lover with whom you speak this language. Because another language is really another mental space in your head, it is a bit like you get to start over and everything feels fresh.<p>And then there is the aspect where speaking another language with other people is just really rich on an interpersonal level: it emports you so much of their culture. When someone talks to you about their childhood in the language of their childhood, for example, you really feel the difference.<p>I have to add though, that my situation is different from that of an an American, in that English is not my native language (its Dutch): so speaking English with Germans will always amount to us speaking through an intermediate which is neither their nor my own. So the advantages to speaking German are more immediate. As an American you have the advantage that people actually speak in your mother tongue to you.<p>But think about it, if you always speak English with Germans, you are always allowing them to get to know you, your culture, but you never take an effort to got to know the part of them that is in German. Ive worked with colleagues in the Netherlands who didnt know Dutchand frankly, I found that after a number of years it can feel belittling: if you come to my country, but you dont care about its language, it also feels like you are not really interested in me.<p>Of course, you can skip the German speaking folks altogether, like dualogy suggests, but missing out on a people seems to be a damn shame.",1340837159

A smallish company with around 200 employees):<p>The ""CEO"":  This guy had a large stake in the company.  It was his baby, and while the ""CEO"" title (which I think gets <i>way</i> over applied) fits him, his official title is ""managing partner"".  While we were in the process of build->launch, he was <i>heavily</i> involved in literally every single department.  Not in a micro-managing way, in an ""this needs to be done and here, I am going to help"" way.<p>It would absolutely not have seemed strange to me, or anybody else, to see him out on a scissor lift with a hammer drill and some cables mounting something to the wall, if that's what was needed.  When we <i>did</i> launch, some things went...wrong.<p>The night before we opened, he, as well as some of his <i>friends</i>, not even people employed by us, spent until almost-down doing ""grunt"" work.  Dirty, tedious work moving huge heavy things around, and walking all over the place to get them.<p>That night he slept here (so did I)<p>The months leading up until that launch, and the months following it, he was here until well after dark because a lot of the people who had been hired were ""green"", and had no idea how to do their job yet.  We were <i>all</i> figuring it out as we went.<p>The culture here at that time was addictive (and I wish we could get that feeling back of ""making it up as we go"".  We've got everything pretty well dialed now).  People throw the cliche of ""we were a family"" around pretty liberally, and I'm going to throw it around too.<p>We were a family.<p>We ate together, we drank together, and the ""core"" group always left together, meaning that nobody left until <i>everybody's</i> work was done.

Even if it only takes 10 grand to make a site ""functional"" in x browser, rebuilding an application to fully work with ie7 does not. If it takes 15-20% (or greater) more development time to add in support for IE7, but IE7 does not provide 15-20% increased revenues (it won't, unless you're making business software specifically for tech-agnostic corporations). You might say oh, it doesn't take 15-20% more time... just use jQuery and magic will happen. No man. It takes much more time.""<p>Oh man, there is so much that is wrong with this comment.<p>First of all, users are more willing to buy from a service that works compared to one that, well, doesn't. That's just common sense. Secondly, if you really think that sprinkling some jQuery over a site will just make it work then I really hope that you aren't a web developer, because that mentality is exactly what is wrong with many websites out there today.<p>""Second is more philosophical. Assuming you are a consumer focused company like AirBnB, you customers are fully capable of upgrading to a new browser. There are no IT limitations on a personal computer. It takes all of 5 minutes and is completely painless. Stop coddling IE7 users; it is obsolete.""<p>Again, if you are incapable of supporting older browsers it's probably because you're a terrible developer. Regardless, there is no philosophical debate here. Users can use whatever the hell they want and it is not your business to tell that what to use. It's entirely up to the client, and if there are users that are using IE6-7 it's probably because they are on old hardware or a machine that isn't theirs (i.e. a work or library machine). The limitation on a personal computer is just that.

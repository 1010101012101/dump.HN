MIT added the whiteboard interface.  The recognition of circles, arrows, and other symbols is also part of Working Model. One of my friends (a Stanford prof who teaches ME) coded a large part of the engine, and he told me it worked like a charm on Intel 486 chips. I'm helping him look for some seed money for a related venture, so interested angels should drop me a line. (YC isn't a good fit for him.)",1192395037

In other words, you don't want to collect the possibilities into an array, and then at the apply contract_sentence() to each in turn? Is this because you're worried about violating the form of a proper tail call?",1192393856

It's not just the overly-cheeky photo captions, the  bad puns, the annoyingly small vocabulary of the new editor (how many times can you use the word ""Schadenfreude [1]""?), the ""amazing new energy technology!"" ads in the back -- but the actual substance, the subjects it reports on, are devolving into factoids and titillation with a side dish of political snark.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aeconomist.com+Schadenfreude"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aeconomist.com+Schadenf...</a>",1192393371

I do think explicitly about tax effects when making business decisions, and there are definitely tax rates that would have changed my decisions, particularly taxes on wealth or investment income that make it less valuable to have savings.  High enough taxes could also cause me to leave the U.S.<p>Regulation, however, is a much bigger impediment to innovation than (current levels of) taxes - there are no companies that I have not started because of taxes, but there are a dozen that I haven't started because regulations would make them impractical or make political influence more competitively important than good execution.",1306159070

2575907,comment,2575246,2575551,3,0,locopati,,,"I'd agree - depression does force you to see that something is off-kilter and needs changing - but I've found that it doesn't place you in a mindset that makes it easy to see what is wrong, how to fix it, or how to go about identifying those things. Much of that can be learned so perhaps it's a shift in treatment that's called for (along the lines of cognitive therapy, which I have found beneficial, as well as meditation + yoga, which I have found even more beneficial).<p>However, I've also learned 'do not make major life decisions while depressed' because often depression lurches to radical and likely long-term damaging solutions which may have a short-term benefit of short-circuiting the depression (e.g. thinking 'quit job immediately without having another one lined up and having family depending on the income').",1306158997

But it is.  It's software that's hosted online that provides value for the users.  Online gaming, a store, a 3d virtual environment, messaging, and more.  They all technically fit the definition.<p>He wants it to be 'Photoshop, but a website' or something like that, and it doesn't have to be.<p>Having said that, if you still rule out PSN as SaaS, then something doesn't need to be SaaS to be 'Cloud'.  Many APIs online are cloud-based and wouldn't fall under his definition of 'SaaS'.  Many virtual worlds/online games, too.<p>The original 'cloud' graphic just meant a bunch of computers all doing about the same thing, practically interchangeably.    It actually meant the entire internet, routing information around.  You didn't have to care how things works, just that info went in 1 side and out the other.<p>These days, it's still computers working together for the same task(s), but more diverse than just routing data.  To properly be 'cloud', it should be scalable.  More usage means more computers working on the task(s).",1306158992

2575904,comment,2575893,2575893,1,0,reasonattlm,,,"The present state of affairs with respect to regulation of research and commercial development of biotechnologies in the US leads us into a situation wherein there are any number of languishing lines of research aimed at intervening in the aging process. They cannot cost-effectively be commercially developed by the US-based groups that demonstrated their effectiveness in animals in the laboratory -- or cannot be developed at all, since the FDA will not approve treatments for aging, and that has the predictable effect on the number of investors willing to pony up for the privilege of running into a brick wall.<p>A similar dampening effect on development stems from the present state of intellectual property laws, which are three shades of ridiculous. But that barrier is less important, I feel, than the FDA's stance on aging and treatments for aging. One thing at a time.<p>Outside the US there are a number of developed nations which in which commercial medical development is less regulated. China for example - and US citizens of a certain age will no doubt feel sad that we can now point to modern day China as an example of comparative freedom in human endeavor. Not sad for the Chinese, but sad for us.Other nations in that part of the world are similarly more open than the US when it comes to commercial development of new medicaltechnology: even India, despite its bureaucracy.<p>When we look to the future of commercial longevity-enhancing medical technologies - or indeed any cutting edge biotechnology - I think we're looking at the process of building a bridge between the less restricted parts of the world and the output of the US research community. That bridge is forged of medical tourism, venture investment, and a flow of knowledge. Without it, little will bedeveloped: there must be an outlet for new science to become new technology, and that outlet is being progressively narrowed in the US with each passing year.<p>Now I can't do anything about medical tourism or venture investment, but I can persuade people to help contribute to the flow of knowledge: to establish a bridge between potential longevity-enhancing technologies that have been demonstrated in the laboratory but can never be fully realized in the US, and developers half a world away who are more free to translate the fruits of research into clinical application. This is a matter of documentation, of building relationships, and of pulling out the most interesting items into the light. Despite this shrinking world, it is still far from the case that researchers on opposite sides of the world have a good view into what is and isn't accomplished.<p>I think that there's a lot that might be done to help this process along, especially given the fact that we're moving into an age of open biotechnology - the impetus, as in software development, will be towards openly shared knowledge and designs, because the economic advantages that confers are enormous. Accompanying this shift will be a growing community of lab collectives, semi-professional developers, and hobbyists. They already exist in the form of the DIYbio community, but that is just the earliest manifestation of what is to come, more akin to the Homebrew Computer Club of the 1970s that spawned computing hardware companies and the rampant growth that followed.<p>So I have started a volunteer initiative, an open collaboration for everyone interested in taking the most interesting published longevity science demonstrated in the laboratory and building a bridge from it to those groups who might be able to develop it commercially in the near future.",1306158947

2575901,comment,2575219,2575219,6,0,andrewcooke,,,"The big difference is that for SVG the structure ""remains"", while with canvas it is ""forgotten"".  That makes SVG more complex, but also easier to manipulate.<p>Here's an SVG site I wrote (it'll take a while to load and will only display in recent browsers).  The way that it responds to mouse-overs is (relatively) easy to program in SVG because you can associate events with structure in the image - <a href=""http://practi.cl/en/proj/pysrc/lepl/lepl#pkg-tab=b-dependencies&stats-btn=b-score"" rel=""nofollow"">http://practi.cl/en/proj/pysrc/lepl/lepl#pkg-tab=b-dependenc...</a> (it's showing package dependencies for a Python library).<p>To do something similar with canvas you would redraw sections instead of simply changing the properties of arcs, etc (and handling user clicks is lower-level - instead of getting the action associated with some ""thing"" in the image, you get a coordinate).  Which is ""best"" depends on the application.  The link above makes more sense in SVG because you've got logically distinct, overlapping components.

It is true that it gets better and worse over time, but not treating a depression is extremely dangerous, as patients tend to see suicide as a good solution to everyone problems.

That's not how SVG is meant to be used  SVG is best when updated incrementally and animated declaratively.<p>SVG has advantage (and should be faster in a decent implementation) when you animate complex shapes: (linear) animation in SVG doesn't require touching of large number of DOM nodes  you just update an attribute of a single group. With SMIL you just trigger the animation and don't touch DOM again. This allows browser to handle repainting natively and cache group/shape bitmaps.<p>OTOH animation on canvas requires issuing hundreds of canvas drawing commands, from JavaScript, each frame, repeatedly.<p>On canvas if you want to move layer that is behind another one, you have to redraw all top layers. In SVG browsers are able to cache layers and use (GPU-)accelerated compositing. I can't find the link, but I've seen demo from Opera where they allow author to declare which parts of SVG change rarely and can be cached as bitmaps.",1306157394

2575808,comment,2575632,2575684,0,0,nuclear_eclipse,,,"> <i>I wonder why Linux distributions such as Ubuntu still download the entire new packages on an upgrade. A lot of upgrade time and bandwidth could be saved by only sending the differences. And it would reduce load on the mirror sites.</i><p>Speaking as someone who has worked on this problem for my own projects [1], I think I can answer this.<p>Fedora/Yum already supports downloading a binary diff between rpm packages to reduce download size, but this also requires keeping a cache of previous rpm's to run the patch against.  There are multiple reasons why you can't rely on binary diffs against the files actually stored on the system, most namely for files like /etc/* that are more than likely modified since installation.<p>But the real problem with binary diffs is that unless you're doing what Google does to ensure that people stay up to date, the number of binaries you need to diff against grows very quickly, and there are a lot of edge cases to take care of.<p>For example, let's assume some package A has been released as version 1, 2, and 3.  When A has a new release 4, you obviously want to build a diff against release 3, but then you also most likely need or want to build a diff against 2 and maybe even 1 to take care of people who haven't already upgraded to 3.  And even if you build a diff against <i>every single version ever released</i>, you will still always need to provide a full version of the package as well for two cases:<p>1. New installations, or reinstallations, of the package.<p>2. When the user has cleared their package cache to save room.<p>And even beyond that, creating diffs involves a lot more effort and knowledge on the part of the packaging team because they not only need to <i>know how</i> to build those diffs, but they also need to keep track of old package versions to build those diffs against.<p>The end result is that you trade download bandwidth and time on part of the server and end users for a lot of effort, time, and storage space on part of the packagers and distro mirrors.  For mirrors that are already encroaching on 50GB for a single release of Ubuntu and/or Fedora, adding a whole bunch of binary diff packages will most likely grow the repository size by at least 30-50%, if not more, depending on how many old versions you diff against.<p>The question then becomes: does this trade off actually make sense, or does it present further roadblocks for contribution from packagers and donated mirrors?<p>[1]: If you would like to see how I handled this sort of task, I have a Python library I wrote to handle the client side updating.  I know it's not the entire piece of the puzzle because it doesn't cover generating the updates, but it might be useful for someone else.  <a href=""http://github.com/overwatchmod/combine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/overwatchmod/combine</a>",1306156715

A large part of .NET depends on a well supported class library. These class library can be very operating system sensitive. Backslashes vs forward slashes, directory separators, nonblocking IO, GUI stack etc. It is hard to do this well. Particularly on a platform that belongs to your competitors.<p>Microsoft has pushed Silverlight as a .NET vm that runs on Mac, with a smaller framework library. So far, this has met will little traction. I don't think it will encourage MS to push this further and wider.",1306156248

Causation has not been proved.<p>The ONLY data on this subject has been doctored by people who stand to gain from it.  The original data was destroyed and nobody else can reproduce their work.  Good science depends on peer review, which cannot be done now.<p>Any steps to 'fix' the planet could very well be pointless (if there's no causation) and are almost guaranteed to have side-effects.

In your recent review of ""Virus"", you commented: ""It didn't help that the print I saw was so underlit that often I could see hardly anything on the screen. Was that because the movie was filmed that way, or because the projector bulb was dimmed to extend its life span?""
A dirty secret is that movies are under-lit in most theaters. Films are produced with the intent that they be projected at the brightness of 16 foot-lamberts. Field research by Kodak found that they are often shown at 8-10 foot-lamberts, well under the SMPTE standard for brightness. To get theaters up to this and other standards, Kodak is introducing the Screencheck Experience program. The under-lighting of screens may be acceptable for a few movies--lest you see the entirety of their badness--but in general it unnecessarily degrades the theater experience. (Carl Donath, Rochester NY)<p>A. I've seen thousands of movies and I believe the Screencheck Experience program would only confirm that ""Virus"" was severely deprived of foot-lamberts when I saw it in a Chicago theater not a million miles from the Water Tower. Martin Scorsese, who travels with a light meter, once told me movies are projected at the correct brilliance in New York and Los Angeles, because that's where the filmmakers live, and they squawk. In a lot of other places, he said, the theaters turn down the juice to save on the replacement costs of expensive bulbs.",1306155811

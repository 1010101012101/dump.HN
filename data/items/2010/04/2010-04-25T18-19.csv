It significantly limits the targets, in space or on Earth, that weapons are capable of hitting.<p>That is only true if you think of traditional applications. There are other uses of nuclear weapons in space, one of which is to create massive EMP attacks. It will only take a couple of Russian satellites in high orbit over the North American continent to fry most of unprotected electronic devices on it. That type of attack will be very hard to prevent and warn against. It is also very effective as it is very disruptive -- imagine most vehicles, radios, cell phones, planes, power plants, water treatment plants being rendered inoperable.  Basically if you see this happening, start heading for the closest nuclear bunker.",1272221831

They're essentially just syntactic sugar for a one-method class.*<p>No, there are many differences, both at the language and at the VM level, although you could emulate the behavior of delegates. You should look at the new MethodHandler from the JDK7 InvokeDynamic proposal ... they've added it for a reason ;)<p>> <i>The CLI has true generics</i><p>The jury is still out on what constitutes ""true generics"" ... IMHO the C++ templates are more true than their C# equivalent ;)<p>But yeah, the Java generics system is a far cry from what it should've been. And it also sucks because there are exceptions ... arrays are reified, and the new MethodHandler from JDK7 is also reified.<p>That said ... you can add reified generics on top of the JVM. It is just a lot of hard work because you can't reuse the current generic types.<p>There are other features that are difficult to implement ... stack allocated values, the primitives that aren't mapping to the JVM types (decimal, ulong), pointers / unsafe code, PInvoke, tail-calls (although I know of a way to have tail-calls, but it's heavy).<p>You can implement anything on top of the JVM, but you will lose efficiency (not to mention of interoperability with Java code).",1272221635

It's simply about what they control and what they don't control, and it's based on the same principles as when someone would want free markets.<p>For example, before the Industrial Revolution, England imported most of it's cotton from India, which was the supplier of most of the world's cotton.  At that point, the English government made all sorts of hindrances to how much could be imported and so on, in order to protect local cotton producers.<p>After the Industrial Revolution, Britain became one of the leading producers of cotton fabric, and suddenly they were huge supporters of 'free markets' ...in places where they didn't explicitly control the pricing of cotton (aka India).<p>So free markets/open standards is the same thing.  It's entirely about what someone controls and what someone doesn't control.

It's better for scuttlebutting, that is, visiting the stores and seeing how customer levels fluctuate. Are there more people visiting the Apple Store this year than last? That kind of thing.<p>A good case in point - I visited a hamburger chain, tasted the food and hated it. I thought the food was mediocre and the prices were too high. But, I decided to keep the stock anyway. Why? They had a new 32 year old investor who fought his way onto the board of directors, fired members of the old management team, made himself CEO, and cut expenditures to the bone. The result? They company steered clear of bankruptcy, became debt free, generated a 10% free cash flow yield, and has so far generated me an 80% return.<p>The thing is - had I just visited the restaurant, I probably wouldn't have noticed this. Red dots being removed from styrofoam cups (cost cutting), a picture of the new CEO in the restaurant (change in management), and sliced rather than cherry tomatoes in the salad (cost cutting) may have been indication of some change; but not enough to tell me about the big behind the scenes changes without the company's financials.",1272218807

It was tested on a target in the Marshal Islands.  I don't believe the HTV-2 reaches space, and it certainly isn't orbital.  It's described as a ""hypersonic glider.""<p>Vandenberg AFB launches a lot of payloads for testing weapons, so launching another non-orbital weapons test is nothing new.  They have regular launches of the Minuteman ICBM to test a missile-intercept system.  If I recall correctly, the Minuteman is the target and we launch an intercept missile out of Alaska to pick off the Minuteman.  So far, I believe they've all failed.<p>The rest of the article is about a vehicle that <i>does</i> enter space and stays there for an extended period of time, and which may contain weapons.  That's why it gets more attention.<p>Here's a news story on the launch from Vandenberg: <a href=""http://www.santamariatimes.com/news/local/military/article_7ef51f34-4f6c-11df-a60c-001cc4c03286.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.santamariatimes.com/news/local/military/article_7...</a>",1272218583

It doesn't matter whether this is true; it saves time by letting you fail faster if you're wrong. This is the more popular understanding of the razor, but it's less useful because it can be wrong, and jackasses often use examples of its wrongness to claim that it never provides any information, in order to advance crackpot metaphysics or religion.<p>The other says that if you have two theories which both explain everything you're observing, then it doesn't matter which one you adopt, so you might as well adopt the simpler one. For example, if I hypothesize that E=mc^2 + u, where u is the number of invisible, otherwise-undetectable pink unicorn particles within three meters of Mars, this theory makes all the same predictions as E=mc^2, and is nondisprovable.

2574439,comment,2573532,2573532,21,0,strlen,,,"The bit about hiring contractors, especially for vital functions such as infrastructure and support is bad advice. A high quality contractor charges a very high hourly rate (it also usually isn't feasible to give them a sizable equity grant in its place), so you're left hiring people who would prefer a full time job but can't get one. This creates a poisonous and unpleasant atmosphere, which makes you even less likely to hire strong people full time.<p>I understand that ""war for talent"" is a popular narrative, but you note that those writing about it are almost always journalists who aren't programmers themselves. Non-technical writers don't understand quality developers want something more than a paycheck: they want to work on challenging problems, with people who they can learn from and in a company that has a shot at making an impact on the world. If you want to hire quality people than you should take hiring (all steps: from employment branding to interviewing to closing) a top priority: give employees time to interview candidates (expect each engineer to interview at least two or three candidates each week), be willing to let a position go unfilled for a _long_ time until the right person is found.<p>In short, be ready to reply ""we'd like to do Y, but either we must strip out a feature X from Y, spend more time working on it or transfer an engineer working on Z to work on Y"". If you're working on a hard technical problem, then your investors and customers shouldn't have a problem with that. If you're not (and there's nothing wrong with that), change your hiring strategy appropriately e.g., if you're building CRM software, stop trying to go after TopCoder finalists and ex-Google Search Engineers and instead look for engineers who are interested in business and product design/development. The former aren't going to be interested in joining you (other than at an exorbitant rate) until you're ready to use their talent, the latter will help you build the business to the point where you will need their help scaling it.<p>To use a vulgar analogy, the strategy of hiring a contractors to ""move faster"" is analogous to a man having nine one night stands hoping to conceive a baby in a month (""because I can't find the right long-term partner, and nine months is too long to wait anyway""): it's wrong on many levels and will poison your culture. It's long been known (Brooks' Law) that adding more ""bodies"" to a project to a project that's at risk of being late will only make it <i>more</i> late. Creating a company full of dubious quality contractors (with no loyalty, no ""fire in the belly"" about the product) will make your company look toxic to engineers used to working at ""talent brand"" companies where engineers are passionate about what they're working on and are confident in their technical abilities.<p>The CEO's real job is to manage the managers (""no, we don't have the resources to ship X at time T""), and sell the company (including to prospective employees). The blog post doesn't read ""wow, this is a company worth leaving or turning down an offer from {Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc...} for!"".",1306103623

I have nothing against moving the industry forward, and of course I wish all my users and my clients' ones would upgrade in timely fashion.<p>My main observations in this discussion is simply that moving the industry forward only works if it's done at a pace where the content providers can take advantage of it. Personally, I don't for an instant believe that Google's and now Mozilla's release schedules with only a few weeks of gap help to achieve that goal. Meanwhile, they can and have screwed things up that have worked fine for years and are in widespread use on web sites today, and I think they are in real danger of reverting to the completely non-standardised web of yesteryear, which makes developing corner cases specially for IE look like a walk in the park.<p>For what it's worth, I find it even more disturbing that even so-called standards groups, particularly WHATWG, now seem to be moving to ""evolving"" documents. They seem to have utterly missed the point of what standards are for.<p>As you've probably realised by now, I'm no worshipper at the altar of Redmond either. I do wish they would consider releasing faster than every couple of years, and I don't buy their nonsense argument about IE9 being unable to run on XP for a microsecond. (What they say may well be technically true, but it smacks of the kind of arguments they made a few years about during the anti-trust case, that they can't possibly separate browser from $OS because of $DEPENDENCY, where $DEPENDENCY appears to have been easily avoidable if they'd coded things up a bit differently.)",1306102417

Occasionally for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key, and grab hold of the radio antenna.<p>11. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need them nor want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the car's performance to diminish by 50% or more. Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation by the Justice Department.<p>12.

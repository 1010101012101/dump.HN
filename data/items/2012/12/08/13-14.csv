For example, 2 is not prime because 3 times 5 equals 2 mod 13, 3 is not prime because it equals 4 times 4 (and, by extension, -4 times -4, which is 9 times 9), etc.",1354974899

Whilst it is pretty easy to nominate yourself right now (login into a wiki, announce nomination), I havent seen much conceptwise. The pirates stand for a massive extension of political participation, exploiting the net to make decisions, develop position and so forth. Yet, the software we use is a UX nightmare and lacks formal power. Liquid feedback, our tool, is more therometer about the partys current status, than an proper tool of political influence. Plus there is a big opposition against any virtual committee (mainly driven by security and fraud concerns). Nevertheless as a MP you are formally binded only to your conscience, and have much freedom to organize yourself, build platforms and so on. One idea would be to have the MP as proxy or megaphone, not making any political submissions him/herself, but only announcing the will of the virtual assemblies. So my questions is, if you would be a MP and your goal would be to allow a huge amount of people to influence political decision making via modern information technology, how would you do it? What problems to do see? Which processes need to be tackled and so forth.",1354973880

We're all second class citizens <i>because</i> we ride along on something that was not made by us or for us.<p>Theoretically we could hi-jack that eco-system by providing something that is better / easier to use. But that takes a long amount of time and very high levels of dedication which usually means people need to get paid, which in turn doesn't work all that well with open source.<p>The reason Linux will continue to be a second class citizen in the PC world is simple: open office / libre office etc sucks. Excel is amazing and word is what a generation of people grew up on.<p>If you want Linux to be a first class citizen then you can achieve that by improving the state of office software.

Try to find a company in a field where you have non tech experience and get them to hire you as a developer.  A CS degree is not as useful as someone who gets the industry.",1354971988

It scores on many of the points you mentioned (Reddit subreddits come close.)<p>I'm sad this part of the net has been fading into obscurity the last ten years especially since its alternatives have proven to be inadequate.  Its greatest power was it being decentralised and thus couldn't be policed by anyone, the variety and custom readers.<p>Its greatest weak point was perhaps the trolls. Maybe others can supply more weaknesses?<p>Really, what does Hackernews as a website have over f.e. a newsgroup alt.news.hackers?",1354971985

That in a dual moitor setup was hard on your desk becasue of the weight, but awesome for programming. Being so used to the vast amount of vertical space, I felt sort of let down by the 'now let's make all widescreen displays' movement. 1080 pixels vertically really doesn't do it for me. But maybe it's just me? Sometimes I see people programming, with the editor taking up only half of the screen and the rest all IDE windows and toolbars and whatnot. That's like 15 lines of code on one screen. I don't get it.",1354971829

Nonetheless, it seems to me that it's usually more of a convenient side-effect than the actual motivation. But thanks for your perspective.<p>Some of the Kickstarter project take manufacturing to an extremely local level. In the project description it will say that their costs are higher because the designers want everything to be manufactured in their hipster town. I feel really uneasy about such sentiments. (And mind you, people call me a hipster all the time.)<p>As for the Chinese economy, I try to be optimistic. However The housing market seems really unhealthy. You'll pay more for an apartment in a not-that-great neighborhood in Beijing than for one in an awesome neighborhood in the capital of many European cities. Meanwhile, the quality of the Beijing apartment will leave much to be desired and the building is actually built on land that is merely leased from the government! Consumerism is crazy too. Did you know that on China's Single's Day (one of the many holidays in China invented by marketeers) sales were higher than on the US's Black Friday?<p>Finally, the Chinese definitely don't care about the environment. It's not in their mindset at all. Everyone wants to drive an SUV (while public transportation is dirt-cheap), the amount of plastic packaging they use is insane, the only recycling is done by homeless people who collect plastic bottles from trash cans, etcetera.",1354971810

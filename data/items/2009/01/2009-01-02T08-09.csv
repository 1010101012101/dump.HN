Probably Los Angeles. It was the hub of new media and technology, with the radio and the airplane. Silicon Valley is the L.A. of the 1930s.",1230886724

I had a quick look at your bio and if what you are planning is the air-compressed scooter then I think this could be a very interesting project and you'd probably regret not doing it. I'm sure you've already done your market research! :) From your bio I don't think you'd have any problems in getting another job if it came down to it.",1230886430

417217,comment,416950,416950,0,0,sqs,,,"After high school and before college, I spent half of a year in Beijing learning Chinese and the other half in Palo Alto working at a Web startup. (It sounds like a cliché now.) This was three years ago. I'm really glad I did what I did, but there were many things I learned during and afterward that would have helped me a lot. A lot of my friends who deferred college for a year don't consider it a good choice, so it's not a given that you will enjoy it.<p>My recommendations:<p>- Leave home.<p>- Spend only your own money. Don't ask or let your parents pay for a single cent. If possible. (But stay on their health insurance.)<p>- Make your own plans. If you're traveling, don't sign up for ""packages"" offered by American (or whatever your home country is) tour companies. Get an airline ticket on your own and correspond with local tour agencies, local universities, etc., on your own.<p>- If you have to spend your parents' money or get your plans approved by them, then do your best to persuade them to give you as much freedom as possible, and take as little money as you need.<p>- Embrace your freedom. If you're traveling, don't overplan. Leave room to take a trip to another city with people you meet or to abruptly decide you want to go somewhere else or do something else.<p>- If you're looking for a job, people will try to take advantage of you. Don't underestimate the value you provide. Don't sell yourself short.<p>- Asia is cheap, safe, and fun. South America, Africa, and the Middle East aren't safe. Europe and Australia aren't cheap. And the US isn't quite as fun (for people who grew up there like me). Those generalizations are what led me to go to China, and I think they still hold (relatively) true.<p>I see from your post history that you don't program. If you're interested in the tech (and tech business) world, which I think you are, then you will be missing out on 99% of it unless you learn to program. I would recommend you figure out what environment would be most conducive to you learning to program, and then put yourself in that environment for the next 10 months. It's that important. Then travel or something for the next two months.<p>My email is in my profile.",1230886316

I considered putting it in, but didn't because of the following:<p>1. The only leap of logic required is to realize that the two options are mutually exclusive: either you win by staying or you win by switching. There is no alternative.<p>2. Writing the code in that concise form, I believe the inherent structure of the problem is much clearer than the mess of classes and function calls.",1230886256
417215,comment,416732,416732,0,0,david927,,,"I would definitely consider outsourcing.  You have to be prepared to spend some time finding the right people, giving test projects, etc.  But if you do it right, you can find amazing people for very good rates.  I've done it for my own projects and it worked out really well.<p>If I could go back and make one change over the last 10 years, it would be to have stayed where I was and outsourced more.  Once, for example, I was sure that I had enough for a couple years with staff.  I went through it much faster than I thought.  Remember that it will not go at all like you're imagining, no matter how good your business plan is, and that no company ever went under with money in the bank.",1230886161

417213,comment,416760,417038,0,0,axiom,,,"Is that the case? I've never profiled it actually. I always just assumed that basic operations (float and int) were all single cycle since there is such a huge incentive to optimize those on the CPU.<p>Random tangent: a while ago I was working on a project where we used a big fancy MCMC algorithm to do some computer vision task. One issue we ran into was that double types didn't have enough precision to compute the partition function. We spent along while trying to figure out a way around having to compute it, and put in 10-20k lines of C++ code to make it happen. Really complicated. Took forever. One day I had the rather silly idea to just use an arbitrary precision floating point library. It was a silly idea because we profiled it and found that it was 20x slower for all floating point computations which seemed to be the bulk of the algorithm (and performance REALLY mattered here.) I decided to try it out on the theory that 90% of the CPU time was spent on memory access, looping, and program jumps, and that even though we had a ton of floating point operations, they were basically free. So I implemented it, and as it turned out we did indeed get a 20x slowdown on our floating point computations. But the overall algorithm only lost about 1% or so, because the floating points stuff only constituted a tiny fraction of the total cost. Since then I just ignore the cost of arithmetic and focus 100% on optimizing program flow. Almost seems obvious in retrospect, but I still see code where people jump through hoops to save a few multiplications, even though in the end it usually costs them more due to cache misses inherent in loops and program jumps.",1230885857

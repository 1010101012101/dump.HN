The truth is the truth and it has a nasty habit of winning out even if it takes hundreds of years. Theories and ideas go into and out of favor over time. The battle between rationalism and empiricism has raged basically nonstop since Aristotle and continues today with each side gaining and losing ground with each generation of thinkers.<p>I'm amazed by the continuing influence of Marx and other socialist philosophers even though we have theories rooted in Platonic arguments and empirical observation that are fairly one sided in their analysis of the subject. It disturbs me greatly that schools teach Keynesian economics and that Paul Krugman has more distribution than what a blog would provide him. I'm disturbed by the success of the Neocons and their apparent love for war.<p>All that being said I move on with my life. I realize that the best I can is argue my case and if I fail then that's fine. Ideas aren't as important as life and the people in it.",1277690325

1466803,comment,1466479,1466640,0,0,philwelch,,,"There are two (more than two, but let's stick with two) basic views of how we define concepts. One is that we define concepts by definition. A cofounder is someone who helps to found a company, therefore (by logical definition) an already-founded company cannot acquire more cofounders. The other is that we define concepts by comparison to bundles of referents. For instance, we know that Steve Wozniak, Paul Allen, Paul Graham, and Gordon Moore are all called ""cofounders"", and that they worked their asses off for equity. If your startup is looking to hire someone who works and gets paid just like a cofounder except without actually cofounding the company, it's looking to hire someone who resembles our ""cofounder"" referents even if it doesn't fit the technical definition.<p>Hence, this controversy just comes down to different ways in which people define and use concepts. Personally, I find it useful to be able to think in both modes.",1277690173

1466798,comment,1466526,1466526,0,0,LeBlanc,,,"My recommendation is to go the start-up route for the following reasons:<p>1) You will be able to solve interesting problems more so than a large company which at least early on will have you doing small iterations on what they already have<p>2) You will be exposed to the opportunity to get business experience of a type much more valuable than what you can get out of an MBA. Get an MBA for the network, not for the academics, and not if you want to solve interesting problems in the CS space<p>3) you will develop the type of valuable experience that all those job applications you are looking at want. Even if a start-up fails, you will be able to point to an interesting thing that you helped develop that will help with the job search in the future<p>Take this advice with a big grain of salt. Do what YOU want to do, like solve interesting problems that you have passion for without worrying about where it will lead you. If the problems are interesting, and the solutions are awesome, you will end up in a great place. If you go build something cool that you can show to start-ups, they will be much more interested in talking to you than if you are just a cover letter + resume combination.<p>Where are you located?

1466789,comment,1466526,1466526,0,0,apu,,,"OK, let me try to answer/comment on what you said. Excuse me if some of these sound blunt.<p>1. Your age is irrelevant.<p>2. Working at a management consulting company as an analyst is almost the definition of enterprise fizz-buzz programming. I haven't met any real hacker who works at those companies, and on the contrary I know quite a few who resent their IT jobs at such companies.<p>3. Quant jobs are also mostly dull, although if you get in a good place at a higher level, you might work on interesting stuff. If you're on the systems side of things, then high-frequency trading places have interesting work on optimizing execution times. However, the high pay at quant jobs is like cocaine -- you'll find it very hard to quit, even if you see more interesting jobs.<p>4. If you actually want to be a technical person solving problems for more than just the next couple of years, there's no need for an MBA these days unless you're NOT at a top-tier technical place. The better places like Google, Facebook, etc. will let you get very high up the corporate ladder without an MBA, and not having one somewhat innoculates against being pushed into more management-y roles.<p>5. It's hard to judge what your abilities actually are. You didn't mention anything about programming projects you've done (COMPLETED), which is one of the biggest pieces of evidence that you are good and capable at hacking. On the other hand you do mention accepted research papers at a good venue -- if the journal is actually good, then this will be an ENORMOUS help in your getting into a PhD program. A quick recap, in case you're unfamiliar about what matters for PhD admissions:<p>* Evidence of research ability. This is basically the only thing the top schools care about. The way they judge this is:<p><pre><code>    * Previous papers published, and the level of the conference/journal they\n      were published in. You (perhaps) have this. You are automatically above\n      90% of applicants.\n\n    * Recommendations from good researchers. You're at a top 7 school, and you\n      did research. Hopefully it was with someone who (a) got to know you well\n      and (b) was impressed with your work and (c) are themselves known as good\n      researchers to others in their field. If so, you're basically in at just\n      about any place you want, as long as you don't fuck up in some other\n      category.\n\n    * Grades matter somewhat if you're at a known good school where the\n      academic standard is tough. It's far less important than the previous\n      two, though.\n\n    * As long as you don't say something completely idiotic in your essays,\n      they don't matter.\n\n    * General GRE scores don't matter at all, as long as you're above some\n      fairly low threshold. Subject scores don't matter at all, even if you're\n      only at the 50th percentile.\n\n</code></pre>\nIn summary, you have a very good shot at getting into a good PhD program, if you're accurately self-assessing your publications/school reputation. Also, it's much easier to get into a PhD program straight from undergrad since your recommenders will remember you best, and often working for even a year really dulls your desire to go ""back to school"".<p>While theoretically PhDs are internships for becoming a professor, in practice less that 50% continue on to academia in CS, so you shouldn't view it as a negative even if you eventually want to go to industry. A PhD will open doors to top research labs like Microsoft/Adobe/Google/Mitsubishi Research, where you'd get to work on cool, tough problems. Getting a PhD at a top place also requires many of the same skills needed for startups -- self-motivation, getting stuff done, working your ass off, being able to present your work well and ""sell it"", being effective at choosing the right problems to solve, solving them, and being able to communicate your results, etc.<p>On the other hand, it is a large time-commitment -- at least 4 years and perhaps 5-6 -- and your experience is largely determined by the quality of your advisor -- both technically and at a personal level how well you get along with him/her.<p>6. Your visa issue shouldn't matter much for big companies, as they all routinely help their employees get better visas and some even start them on the green card process. However, for startups, this could be a problem, depending on how much risk you can handle. 29 months is not necessarily going to be enough, and I don't know how easy it is to get a visa upgrade while at one.<p>Reply to this comment if you need further clarification or have more questions.",1277689484

Sense (HTC's UI tweaks) is very nice, and I thought it was a must have, but I played with someone's Nexus One, and I think it's fine. In some ways I prefer the stock UI, and getting all of the updates instantly would be really nice. (I'm still waiting impatiently on Froyo, which will come ""in the 2nd half of the year"" or when someone figured out how to root the Incredible :) )<p>I'm not sure how pay-as-you-go would work, but you definitely can be without a 2-year contract if you buy a Nexus One. (Though you probably could just pay full price to get an Incredible or the like and also do that.) If I had to guess, I'd say that people's pay-as-you-go data rates will be really high (since most people with pay-as-you plans don't have smartphones) that it won't be worth it. But if you do want to go that route, look at different companies' rates and see if it'll work.<p>I really like my Incredible, and I'm glad I got off AT&T since I'm heading to Silicon Valley in the fall, but I kind of wish I had gotten a Nexus One so I could get Froyo. It's going to be awhile 'til I get it, and when I do, it probably won't have WiFi hotspot, so I'm going to have to use PDANet or the like if I want tethering.<p>Here's the rundown of pros and cons as I see it:<p>* Nexus One--Get updates immediately without carrier interference. Nice hardware. Stock Android.<p>* HTC Incredible--Basically the same hardware as the Nexus One. 8MP camera instead of 5. Verizon. Takes awhile to get new Android versions.<p>* HTC EVO--Big screen, but also big physically (you have to carry it around in your pocket everywhere, remember). Apparently has pretty bad battery life. Have to be on Sprint. Same Sense pros and cons as the Incredible.<p>* Droid X--Also big like the EVO. Verizon. Pretty similar to it spec-wise. Has a special Motorola-branded Android, so also will probably be slow to get new updates. I generally consider HTC to make better hardware than Motorola. Hard to know too much since it's not out yet.<p>* Droid 2--hard to know too much since it's not out for awhile, but you probably don't want it unless you have to have a physical keyboard. You probably don't need one. The correction is pretty nice, and lately I've been using Swype, which allows me to type pretty fast.<p>If I were you, I'd get the Nexus One unless you really prefer Sense to stock Android or really prefer Verizon to AT&T/T-Mobile, in which case I'd get the Incredible.",1277688515

1466712,comment,1466288,1466288,0,0,devonrt,,,"I agree with the spirit of the post, but not (many of) the actual points. Look at the list of languages the author points to in the first paragraph: PHP, Python, Ruby and Objective-C. Only one of these has anything remotely close to an ""officially sanctioned experience"" and that's because it's a proprietary system.<p>His first complaint is that getting started with Clojure involves starting a REPL and that this is not how actual development is done. Well, no, it isn't. It is however, where you will spend most of your time. Not only that, but the most accessible documentation on both the Ruby and Python official sites mostly involve using a REPL. Clojure's only problem is that running the REPL is slightly more involved. Also, Clojure 1.1 is not already outdated and I'm not sure where the author got this idea. 1.2 will have some great features, but AFAIK will be completely backwards compatible. I'm not sure where a beginner would even learn about 1.2 without some serious internet trolling.<p>Next the author complains about how difficult obtaining Clojure is difficult. There is a ""Download"" link right on the clojure.org homepage that lists zip files for both 1.1 and 1.0, both of which include the source. This is <i>less</i> difficult than getting Python or Ruby, which involves downloading and installing a pre-compiled binary or compiling it from source. Also, the author complains about 1.2 not being available, even though 1.2 has not been publicized and is still in beta; true beginners probably don't know that 1.2 even exists.<p>The author complains about the fact that there are a whopping <i>three</i> choices for IDEs for Clojure, despite the fact that each of these IDEs also have plugins for Ruby, Python and PHP. There are no fewer IDE choices for these languages. If you ask most Rubyist which IDE you should use many of them will tell you TextMate, and editor that is neither free nor cross-platform. The author then brings up Xcode; well, of course every Objective-C developer uses Xcode, they don't have much choice. Clojure's myriad of IDEs is not a problem unique to Clojure.<p>Build systems, again, I don't think this problem is unique to Clojure. Where is the great documenation for Rake? Or Buildr? What build system do Pythonistas even use? Seriously, I've been using Python for a while now and I have no idea if there exists a canonical build tool. Comparing these platforms to the likes of Objective-C and .NET in terms of tool support is just unfair, in my opinion.<p>Like I said, I agree with the spirit of the post. Clojure is not an easy language to get into, but it has very little to do with the points the author made. Much of the cognitive load involved in getting started with Clojure has to do with the fact that it's a Lisp and most programmers are used to ALGOL syntax and Object Oriented semantics. Another thing to keep in mind is that Clojure is an incredibly young language. Much, much, much younger than Python, Ruby, PHP, Objective-C or even Scala. Taking into account Clojure's youth it's amazing that it's as far as it is.",1277687457

It's beautifully designed but it's founded on some powerful but difficult concepts. Functional programming, iteration via recursion, multimethods, concurrency, macros, sexprs, the whole java stack under the hood you really do have to understand.<p>I'm all for making it as easy on the noob as possible but clojure will never be blub. It makes the hard problems easier but the price is that the easy problems are harder.",1277687250

Or are you asking why more companies don't have SF offices?<p>For the latter, it seems obvious that real estate and infrastructure are cheaper in the Valley.<p>For the former, it really depends on where you live in SF.<p>If you are driving a car to the Valley, how far are you from the 280 or 101?  Does your employer allow you to work your schedule around the rush hours?  Are you working for a startup where you are expected to put in long hours and possibly even spend a lot of time with coworkers outside of the office?<p>If you are taking CalTrain, how far are you from the nearest station?  I lived in the Sunset for several years and commuted to Palo Alto; it was a bit maddening, mostly due to the long time it took to ride MUNI to CalTrain.  Door-to-door was around 100 minutes, but it was 100x less stressful than driving. Plus, I could catch up on news/email on the train.  On the rare days that I'd drive in, I'd arrive at work already feeling beaten down.<p>While it's true that there's plenty of cool stuff going on in the Redwood City-Sunnyvale corridor, I still prefer life in SF.

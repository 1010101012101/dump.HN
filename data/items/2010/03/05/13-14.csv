1169359,comment,1169227,1169292,0,0,DougWebb,,,"Good points. I hadn't thought of the potential to brute-force the CCV based on having the encrypted and unencrypted CC, but I had only spent a minute thinking about it. Perhaps in minute #2 I would have realized that. I was thinking of using the CCV in combination with other user data as the key anyway; it was just a piece of data that wouldn't be stored in my system, so that the data in my system wouldn't be sufficient to decrypt the CC.<p>To brute force the CCV, you do need the clear text CC. You wouldn't get that from me because I wouldn't be storing it. If you got it from someplace else, there's a good chance the game is up already. But you're right; if my database got stolen and combined with some other data sources, the customer's info could be matched up to get both cleartext and encrypted versions of the CC, and if the person doing this knows my encryption algorithm (a disgruntled developer, for example) they could brute-force the CCV. Maybe encrypting the other user data is appropriate as well, based on the user's password which also would not be stored anywhere in my system. Now, you need to brute-force the password just to get the name/address info from my database records, then you need to match that against someone else's cleartext CC numbers, then finally you can brute-force CCVs from my encrypted CC if you know my algorithm and what I'm using for keys. That's a fairly high barrier.<p>For what it's worth, my company does do CC transactions, and we do use a service provider for this which I 100% agreed with. Our user's address and payment info never touches our system at all; we send them off to the payment processor, and the payment processor sends us a token to tell us the transaction went through ok.",1267797184

However, you usually don't need to send over the CVV code to make a transaction if previous transactions have been made to that mid.<p>At the same time, Visa and MC make up their own rules, and Amazon, PayPal, and others could have their own agreements.",1267794276

It makes it easy to discover the security code if you can get the CC number, which isn't so hard to do.  In fact, unless I'm mistaken, it's not allowed to use the CVV for anything.  But basically, if someone is able to get the CC number, then it's merely a quick check of the possible security codes, which is small in number. Granted, I understand why you want your credit card number encrypted using user encryption, but instead of using the CVV, you might try using something else, like their password.<p>Storing the CC number in an encrypted format is fine, however.  You want to be able to retrieve that information at a later date, after all.  Should a user want to make another purchase, they really shouldn't have to enter their CVV all over again.<p>Granted, this all assumes you have to handle this.  An even safer way is to use the gateways capabilities.  Many of the option to create rebillable transactions.  You send over the specifics, and they handle the rebilling for you, and you don't have to store anything of the users.",1267794146

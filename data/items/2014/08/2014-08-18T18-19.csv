It is, in fact, the same kind of behavior you get with templated code: you can instantiate your template with any type you wish; compile errors will occur when the instantiation is used in ways that are forbidden by the type. This behavior has been recognized as less than ideal, and the issue will be addressed by concepts. My question is: if we have this behavior not only for templates, but for every variable, isn&#x27;t that less type-safety? Isn&#x27;t that less than &#x27;strongly typed&#x27;?

The homes we are seeing right now are pretty basic in the sense that a first-time home buyer would not be considering them if they had a million dollars cash in the bank. Yet these homes are going for all cash or 50% down -- I think the main reason is people with extra money have few options to park their cash; since asset prices across the board (and across the globe) are at all-time-highs.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/upshot/welcome-to-the-everything-boom-or-maybe-the-everything-bubble.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/upshot/welcome-to-the-ever...</a>",1408388147

Further, suppose that the ratio between the small population and the large population is R (in the article this is R = 10 / 100 = .1). In this situation, upon discovering that you&#x27;re inside the small population, the posterior probability of heads ends up as<p><pre><code>    p / (R - p * (1 - R))\n</code></pre>\nSo what if the coin is very unlikely to be heads instead of 50/50? If p = .001 (and we leave R = .1), our estimate of the probability heads after we observe that we are in the small population only comes up to about 1%.<p>Thus, the real fallacy in the argument is that the choice of prior is unimportant.

Most of my friends who work in technical roles have two-page resumes, and I assume this is because the extra page is needed to accommodate a larger listing of projects, programming languages, etc. Is the assumption correct that recruiters expect two-page resumes from undergraduates for technical roles, or should I still limit myself to one page?",1408388091

I would, however, like to see if, for example – there are other fields which in which women participate a lot despite them being more sexist. &#x27;yummyfajitas mentioned some examples and it would be interesting to ask people in them, &quot;What makes you go into this field despite it having an atmosphere that we in the tech field might describe as being sexist?&quot;, and learn something from them.<p>As people who would preferably like to see carefully constructed arguments starting from first principles, statements like &quot;oh, of course, something is established, so someone who is questioning the statement has an axe to grind&quot; give off a petulant, uncompromising vibe, and should, in my opinion, be avoided.

All generalizations about when and where to use it are generalizations and likely to start an argument.<p>3. Ultimately it&#x27;s up to you and your diff reviewers to do the right thing. There will be people reading your code in the future and they will judge you and your decision, so choose wisely.

No one writes &quot;vector<int>::size_type sz = v.size();&quot; I dare you to search your code for it.<p>5. The only controversial generalization I feel safe making, knowing saying it will get me into trouble, is that experienced non-C++11 (whether coming from C++03 or other languages) coders tend to be more apprehensive and cautious, using `auto` less than experienced C++11 programmers.

Let me summarize:<p>* KDE Frameworks 5 made its first stable release on July 7th, 2014. That&#x27;s since been followed by Frameworks 5.1 one month later. It&#x27;s monthly releases from here on out. This is production-ready code.<p>* KDE Plasma 5 made its first stable release on July 15th, 2015. This was followed by Plasma 5.0.1 one month later. Plasma 5 does monthly maintenance releases, while feature releases are on a three-month interval, i.e. Plasma 5.1 will be released in October. 5.0 is considered a stable release, but it&#x27;s a dot-oh with some rough edges (nothing comparable to 4.0 at release, though), and the distros are also still doing their integration work right now. The release notes and an errata list provide some guidance there. Most distros will replace Plasma 4 as default with 5.1 or 5.2 later this year, when everything will have settled nicely.<p>* KDE Applications is doing a 4.14 feature release this month. This will be the last one built entirely on the KDE 4 libraries. Future KDE Applications releases will start shipping ports of apps to Frameworks 5, at the discretion of their individual maintainers/dev teams (some have had porting branches for a good while).<p>> Will Kubuntu ship Plasma5/KF5 next release (14.10) even if the applications are not yet ready?<p>I&#x27;m not 100% on top of the plans of the Kubuntu community, but I believe 14.10 is still going to use Plasma 4 by default - you might want to look into that more closely though, I&#x27;m not certain. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll offer Plasma 5 for interested users in some form as well though. They probably do already. KDE 4 apps still run in Plasma 5, of course, so that&#x27;s no limitation (and KF5 apps also run in Plasma 4, for that matter).<p>Yes, on the promo front this does mean we don&#x27;t get to do a big &quot;BANG! It&#x27;s KDE 5!&quot; moment, but it also has some advantages for promo - e.g. driving home that KF5 isn&#x27;t useful just for making apps that run in Plasma, and by implication that KDE Applications aren&#x27;t useful just in Plasma.",1408387996

One thing I&#x27;ve been wondering about for a while is how the auto keyword relates to type-safety. The blog post lists the point &quot;auto type deduction everywhere&quot; under &quot;type-safety&quot;. But consider the line<p><pre><code>  auto x = foo();\n</code></pre>\nSuppose you refactor your code, and in the process, the return type of foo() changes. Without the use of auto, the compiler would produce an error message, alerting you that the above line of code may need your attention. As it is, with the use of auto, the above line will compile no matter what. In other words, that particular line now behaves as if C++ was an untyped language. Isn&#x27;t that a step down as far as type-safety is concerned? Please note: I&#x27;m not asking here whether that&#x27;s good or bad.

I&#x27;ve read about a couple of people trying but they don&#x27;t get very far.<p>> Fixing a live system can also be hazardous if you are replacing a function that may be on the stack at the moment, or if you are in any sort of multithreaded/process environment. Bugs become much harder to reason around and fix in those cases because there can be race conditions about which functions actually get called while you&#x27;re applying your fix.<p>This is a well known problem in Lisp-land, not because you&#x27;re always hot-patching things in production, but because that&#x27;s the way you develop code. There are a lot of things you can do to make atomic code loading possible, and different CL implementations have various levels of race condition proofing in the compiler and runtime systems.<p>> TL;DR You can, but probably shouldn&#x27;t.<p>Most people who make this argument make it disingenuously or out of ignorance.

Firstly, I&#x27;m not saying we should forsake Knuth&#x27;s advice - I don&#x27;t think his advice ever really covered architectural decisions.  It&#x27;s more that I&#x27;ve seen it applied (incorrectly, imo) to justify some obviously questionable decisions.<p>Changing my API to add bulk retrieval is easy.  Changing all (or a significant fraction of) the code that depends on that API to take advantage of the change is hard, particularly when you&#x27;re working on an enormous product.  Unfortunately this is an example of a situation where you often experience death by a thousand cuts, and IME the 97%/3% split doesn&#x27;t hold up at all.<p>I think the other reason I think it&#x27;s worth caring about this stuff up front is because it&#x27;s not terrifyingly hard/time consuming, and applying simple considerations such that you don&#x27;t screw yourself later doesn&#x27;t have to impose an excessive tax upon your codebase quality.  The same is often not true of pervasive code microoptimisation.<p>I suppose there&#x27;s an extent to which such basic architectural  decisions could be likened to simply &#x27;doing the right thing&#x27; when you&#x27;re coding - using sets instead of arrays for &#x27;contains?&#x27; heavy code, and so on.

Instead they are numbered from 1 to 100. The numbers are painted on the outside. Then a fair coin is tossed (by God perhaps). If the coin falls heads, one person is created in each cubicle. If the coin falls tails, then persons are only created in cubicles 1 through 10.<p>>You find yourself in one of the cubicles and are asked to guess whether there are ten or one hundred people?

Since 10 times more people are in cubicles in the heads case, the probability that you find yourself in a cubicle at all is ten times higher in that case, which affects your prior.

I have been there. It has been one of the most demoralizing and depressing experiences of my entire life. Working your ass off for something while seeing your co-founder not really giving a shit simply doesn&#x27;t work unless you intend to make a complete idiot out of yourself. Startups aren&#x27;t socialist communities. Anyone who signs up should be aware of that.<p>> Then who cares if you &quot;only&quot; get 50% of the company?<p>Well then why not give up all of the company and give all of the shares to your co-founder slacking off? Company stake isn&#x27;t only about the money. It is equally about control and about capital. Imagine having 50% for the &quot;main&quot; founder, 20% for the co-founder and 30% owned by angels / VCs who actually put assets into the company. Sounds like a better deal to me...<p>> The world is gonna pay you back in so many other ways than your 50%.<p>I am not sure how to express utmost disagreement with this. In the case of success you will get paid back exactly what has been agreed to in writing. Nobody will <i>ever</i> consider you the &quot;spiritual&quot; owner or founder of the company just because you say you worked harder. But everybody will consider you the real founder if your equity stake is higher. Simple as that.<p>> The other piece of advice is try to be really picky with your co-founders. Find ones that you trust and have worked with before or can get amazing references about.<p>Yes, this is good advice. However a startup can bring out really bad aspects of one&#x27;s personality. Sometimes aspects you didn&#x27;t know existed before you started the startup. Make sure you pick someone you know is loyal and handles stress well. These are the most important aspects of co-founder picking.",1408385320

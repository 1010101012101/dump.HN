2211112,comment,2210512,2210512,0,0,patio11,,,"I spend a wee bit too much time on the Internet, and much of that is sort of dual use for my personal enjoyment and marketing.  I have participated in HN and a few other forums for about fivish years now, and that has been a great opportunity to meet people.  I try to get out to conferences and meet ups to meet folks outside of the massive Ogaki tech mafia.  I also have a blog which has been fairly popular.<p>The most important thing I do for marketing is helping people, frequently.  It opens a lot of doors.  It also means there are a couple of... thousand, maybe? (crikey) ... people who will say nice things about me even when I'm not in the room.  That has lead directly to consulting work (and business opportunities) in the past.<p>Can I say one heretical thing?  Contribution to OSS is not by itself marketing.  It is a fairly low ROI way to reach decision makers unless you are identified with a popular project.  (You can easily spend many hours on a commit that no one but you or the mainainer will ever know you wrote.  Spend the same amount of time directly solving a problem for someone and you have a fan for life.)<p>P.S. I truly love Github, but would not host my OSS on it, because it encourages use patterns which are extraordinarily suboptimal for marketing oneself.  YMMV.",1297544276

Many things like the creation of the commercial sewing machine in the mid 1800s were strongly encouraged by patent and intellectual property protection, despite the fact that patent thickets arose -- i.e. many competing individuals held patents covering individual components necessary to a good sewing machine. How these issues were resolved actually has great relevance for so-called modern issues of ""patent trolls,"" since they existed back then too.<p>Source: <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1354849"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1354849</a>",1297544089

2211085,comment,2210147,2210829,0,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I do not care about the downvoting. But I am guessing it is due to my saying that biology is harder than physics [1]. Perhaps I should clarify to say that a <i>broad</i> mathematical understanding of biology is a harder problem than doing so for your typical system studied in physics. In biology, systems can only be modeled and not understood or derived from fundemental principles, as the interactions of the basic entities are too complex. Or consider: Quantum mechanics, it is a straight forward linear theory (just conceptually difficult) while much of biology is analytically and computationally hard, often involving things like non-linear dynamical systems. A further difficulty here is that the behaviour of the whole of the things studied in biology cannot be inferred by studying its constituents - due to feedback-dissipation processes leading to self organization.<p>While I am clarifying, I might as well point out that while I personally believe that the usefulness for looking for broad general factors is meaningless considering the dimensions in consideration, there might be some use for them in aggregrate. However, these should not be taken for more than they are. Statistics. Furthermore, You, yummyfajitas, argue agianst a strawman. <i>Did you read the article?</i> Because if you did you would have seen:<p><i>I don't want to be mis-understood as being on some positivist-behaviorist crusade against inferences to latent mental variables or structures. As I said, my deepest research interest is, exactly, how to reconstruct hidden causal structures from data.</i><p>...<p><i>Similarly, pointing out that factor analysis and related techniques are unreliable guides to causal structure does not establish the non-existence of a one-dimensional latent variable driving the success of almost all human mental performance. It's possible that there is such a thing. But the major supposed evidence for it is irrelevant, and it accords very badly with what we actually know about the functioning of the brain and the mind.</i><p>Which leads me to the fact that Shalizi has no qualm against dimensionality reduction. Instead he is against the methodologies used and how the conclusions are drawn:<p>1) g is almost a tautology. It is due to the correlations in the tests which are made to correlate. When performing such factor analysis on these variables a dominating factor which most explains their variance must appear due to algebraic reasons.<p>2) No one has tried to explained g directly, <i>experimentally</i> or otherwise. Instead they still argue in terms of correlations.<p>3) They still use simple correlation matrices - linear models from yestercentury. Other more appropriate or robust methods such as non-parametric statistics have since been refined or developed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://metabolism.math.duke.edu/docs/04whyams.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://metabolism.math.duke.edu/docs/04whyams.pdf</a>",1297543650

2211083,comment,2210026,2210719,0,0,dkarl,,,"It's a reasonable way (the only way) to develop a skill -- even after you have a conceptual understanding of how to do something, you still have to practice a little bit at it.  Practice is required first of all to clarify your understanding, but even then practice is necessary to polish your skill enough that you can use it to accomplish something.  (I.e., you have to be able to execute the skill and have enough attention left over to understand something else.)<p>So many problems in education come from the stigmatization of anything resembling practice as ""rote"" and ""unstimulating.""  When you stigmatize repetition, you make it very hard to develop skills.  In effect, students are expected to develop ""understanding"" (the fun, easy part) without developing any skills (the boring, repetitive part.)  Unfortunately, working without any polished, dependable skills is awful.  It's anxiety-inducing.  You have a little bit of doubt about every single step, and as you complete step after step, your confidence in getting the right answer goes down and down.  Having a set of solid skills gives you base of confidence, a security blanket that reassures you while you tackle new ideas.",1297543632

2211052,comment,2210147,2210147,0,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"Largely I agree with him, and at times I suspected some such.  E.g., just testing some software, I generated some 'random' symmetric, positive definite matrices, found the eigenvalues, and noticed that there was a big one and the sizes went down quickly.  So, in linear equations, a few variables constructed from the eigenvectors of the largest few eigenvalues, can make a good approximation to all of many variables.  So, factor analysis makes a good data compression technique.  Can't find fault with that.<p>That just a few of the largest eigenvalues/vectors can explain all the data well is curious.  So really he might have just used R and some Monte Carlo to show us how variance explained increases with number of factors used.  I'm surprised he didn't do this.<p>Much or all of this has long been clear.<p>But what I didn't like was his drifting off into old goals of the psychologists.  I couldn't figure out if he was a psychologist with an ax to grind or what.  Instead, he's a statistical physicist.  Curious.<p>The psychologists looking for 'causality' have a goal that is from tough down to impossible.  We should have been concluding that.  That he got off into arguing about 'causality' seemed a bit silly.  I don't know all what silly stuff the psychos are trying to believe, but arguing with silly psychos is a bit silly.<p>But it remains:  Give a test with some mental puzzle problems, and in just a linear way can explain a lot of the data with just one factor.  Curious.  Maybe somewhat useful.  'Causality'?  Likely not if only because we know that there is a biological and neurological basis and have made no connection with that.<p>Then I didn't like his use of 'factors':  He has some factors correlated.  No:  The usual approach is that, like all the eigenvectors are orthogonal, the factors are all uncorrelated.  Maybe the psychos look for some uncorrelated 'factors' trying to get at some of their guesses about causality, but in this case he should have been more clear.<p>Finally, he wants Gaussian to justify being interested in means, variances, and covariances.  Well, in the Gaussian case, sample mean and variance are 'sufficient' statistics.  But even without Gaussian, means and covariances remain important, e.g., for the inner products in the Hilbert space of L^2 real random variables.",1297542768

If memory serves me, they benefit from expanding or establishing the reach of their search, web apps, native apps, and thus their ads. Since advertising is the keystone of their business model, anything they can do to ensure ubiquity of their brand (and thus, advertising) is an important thing to do.<p>Sure, it's ""open"", so developers can use other ad-networks, but that's not necessarily going to hurt them as much as it would to have no presence in the mobile space.<p>Now, why develop a whole platform instead of just offering their ads on other platforms? If Android becomes the dominant platform, Google is in a really good position, with respect to brand ubiquity. Better than they'd be if Nokia or HP or Apple had the dominant platforms, because there's no guarantee Google would have an ""in"" on any of those.",1297540941

Most of the chips were large value denominated and hence nearly all of the stolen chips were worthless the moment the thief walked out the door.<p>Also, the article is not claiming the thief was captured because of the RFID. The article is simply highlighting how the RFIDs in the chips foiled the thief by making the chips worthless almost immediately, and then goes on to highlight how RFIDs within chips are enabling casino operators to track user behavior in new and novel ways. The focus of the story is not that RFID was used to catch the bad guy, rather the focus is on how RFID tech within these chips has changed casino operation, from user tracking, to ""turning off"" stolen chips on demand.",1297540887

Tablets don't have hardcore games\n   3. Tablets can't do ""real"" work\n   4. Tablets aren't better than laptops when it comes to surfing the web,\n      watching movies, etc.\n   5. Tablets will be replaced with other tablets (who would have thought!)\n</code></pre>\nReasons 1-4 are all based off the assumption that tablets should be able to compete with laptops and phones at the same time. However, tablets are in a different market than phones and laptops for a reason. Apple and some other companies have come along and created something that people have been longing for a while: an intermediate device between a phone and a laptop.<p>Tablets are portable, but not the same way phones are. That's because people would rather carry around something of bigger size with more functionality than a phone.<p>Tablets don't have hardcore games, because the majority of users are casual gamers. Hardcore games are for people who sit down at their computers for hours while leveling up on a game. Casual games are for people who want to play games in short spurts for quick fun. No long term commitment is needed.<p>Tablets do the work most people need to do on the go. ""Real"" work is done at a desk on a laptop or desktop. Tablets are there to fill in and help get the basic work done when you're on a taxi, plane, etc.<p>Tablets let you surf the web and watch movies anywhere, with ease. Instead of some distant interaction with your laptop using a mouse, tablets offer direct control using touch. They give you the features you need and no more. Content consumption and entertainment has never been better than it has with the tablet.<p>I will refrain from discussing the last argument listed in the article, as another argument will come along in a few weeks and replace that argument. There's no worth wasting my time doing something like <i>that</i>. :)",1297540886

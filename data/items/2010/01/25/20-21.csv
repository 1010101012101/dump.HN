1076150,story,,,3,1,orborde,"HN Point of Order: Should I upvote responses to stupid comments?",,"People regularly post HN comments that clearly indicate that they haven't read the linked article, and are rightly downvoted for it. My question is: should people responding with clarifications receive upvotes?<p>Often, someone responds to such ""didn't RTFA"" posts with a brief summary or pithy comment about how the parent needs to RTFA. This is free karma for the responder, who only needs to restate the article and/or insult the parent, both of which are noise to me. Do others disagree?<p>The guidelines are not explicit about this, so I am explicitly asking the HN hive mind.",1264453159

You can fume memory (crash the browser within 30 seconds) without even writing a single line of code, just by having an artist placing certain kinds of keyframed animations and fonts.  We spent weeks trying to explain this problem to the absolutely idiotic Adobe Support Gold, and after months we got something like ""seems like something might be up.  we'll have our engineers look into it.

1076146,comment,1075716,1075945,0,0,pyre,,,"I don't think that Everest was the best example (though it did get the point across). Part of enjoying the splendor of Everest is having a decent respect for the harshness of nature, and the danger of the climb. If you just put a cable car up there that takes you to the top, then you hardly have the same awe and respect for nature. It just becomes a tourist attraction.<p>This has nothing to do with status (at least <i>my</i> opinion doesn't). The same thing happens with many of our natural wonders when we turn them into tourist attractions. Even as far back as the 1800s, Europeans were disgusted with the way that Americans had turned Niagara Falls from a natural wonder into a tourist trap.",1264453095

If I wanted to go crazy I could spend another minute adding the files to the cron job that syncs data up to S3.<p>Of course there's a chance that it'll involve a bit of maintenance at some point, and that'll soak up a bit of my time. My experience with hosted solutions is that they have far more frequent hosting issues resulting in lack of access to data (be that scaling problems, being offline for maintenance, bad deploys etc) which soak up lots of time for everyone on the project.<p>When I'm in control of the situation I know that at least in a bad case scenario I can spin up another server, grab the last good backup and be up and running again within the hour.

Making child porn also shouldn't be a crime unless it falls under child abuse laws. For example, animated or CGI child porn should be legal because its production and consumption harms no one. (Currently it's illegal and people have gone to jail for it.) We stopped imprisoning and castrating homosexuals sometime ago, but apparently people can't internalize the too-abstract ideas of ""victimless crime"" and ""private business"". See that guy? He's a wacko, I tell you. He loves watching movies where people <i>kill</i> other people with <i>guns</i>! One day he'll get a gun and attack our kids, our precious little darlings.<p>And about that hacker from the article, I wonder if his system can be used to catch copyright infringers? People who download offensive texts? People who visit blacklisted sites, where the blacklist depends on the country?

To say that climbing Everest is about experiencing nature is actually absurd.  People climb Everest because it is an accomplishment that is as much about personal triumph as it is about experiencing nature.  If the trek is modified to require no personal growth, it is no longer the same trek.  The author's cool approach to the subject allows him to convincingly deconstruct the hardcore perspective, but when I look at what remains after he's done, I am not convinced that it is gaming.<p>TL;DR:  The logical extension of the article is that someone who watches a real-time movie of people climbing Everest has a similar experience to those <i>actually climbing Everest</i>, and should be allowed to claim that they too have climbed Everest.  In my opinion the author does a disservice to us all by making a convincing argument of this.",1264452763

And as I've pointed out before, they use Flash to play h.264 video anyway. The difference with <video> is that Mozilla is actively forbidding users from passing that supposed burden onto the operating system vendor, who in the case of Windows and Mac OS X, have already licensed h.264. In the case of free software operating systems, users can choose whether they want to have support for h.264 or not, just as they have for years with any number of other patent-encumbered formats.""<p>Flash (or any other proprietary thing such as activex) is not part of the html or maintained by W3C. It is controlled by a private company.\nFlash is a proprietary technology installed as an extension for browser. What flash does is irrelevant.\nIf people wish to only published information under proprietary extensions and limit the scope of their work, that's their problem. But introducing non-free (as in freedom) part in basic protocols is another story. Internet should be open to anyone.\nSo please, don't mix up proprietary extensions and standards published bu W3C, which should remain open.<p>Regardind Mozilla's choice, it is their choice to not support patent encumbered formats. Some approve (like me), some don't. If you wish to fork it, go ahead, code is free.<p>About other patent-free formats:\n""Dirac is great. At some point we'll probably add Dirac support.

It takes development time away from making a quality challenging gameplay experience. Unfortunately, since the casual market is larger than the hardcore market, it is smart for the developers to focus on the easier modes that cater to this casual base of players. The end result is that hard modes in games generally feel more liked some quick and dirty hack to make enemies super resistant to attacks or perfectly accurate aiming machines, or just throwing more of them at you.<p>Perhaps if more developers took time to create a well-crafted and challenging gameplay experience it wouldn't bother me so much. More complex objectives or smarter enemies.

If I post Random Link To an Article I Found Online, I don't bother asking any of my friends to upvote. If I post Ask HN: Review My Startup That Will Make Me Millions, I really want to make sure that gets seen so I get plenty of insight, so I'll either ask 1 or 2 of my friends to or tweet the link to the HN discussion, knowing that only 3 or 4 of my followers even have HN accounts that they've used enough for their votes to count, so I'm not gaming the system to a ridiculous degree.",1264449801

However, I don't think the correct way to do it is to say ""Here's some vague hints, now try to guess what we're talking about by playing with these blocks"". The way I was taught, which I found pretty effective, was that we'd be given an theorem, then in some cases (not all, or we'd never get anywhere) prove that statement. When you hand over the theorem and then make the student prove it, he applies and synthesizes previous theorems to explain the new one.",1264449629

There are records of the director of the nation-wide emergency task-force being being interviewed and saying things like ""After these afternoon quakes there is nothing to be feared, I can assure you. My fellow colleague and quake researcher can tell you the same"", and one of the convicted scientists cues in ""Sure, there is nothing to be feared. Indeed, these small earthquakes have released a lot of energy, making a big earthquake impossible"". _Impossible_. That is not correct scientific communication, that is being the wingman of a politician being interviewed by national TV.",1350989992

The problem was hard, not solved before and he did it. Its absolutely brilliant for that effort, and the kind of impact it has had on human history. Even if it was easy, by a common mathematicians measure, its still great. Because he took it head on and solved it.<p>Your point of argument is a metaphor which a non technical author would have used or even used in exaggeration by mistake.<p>Sorry but pedantic arguments make a persons case look bad. Its like complaining about Khan academy's Python course. Smart intelligent people feel guilty when solving a problem well within their reach, was taken by somebody else and solved by them. It makes them feel more bad, when the solution becomes famous and brings a lot of fame to the inventor. It seems that is what you are going through here.",1350989914

Anything that is either finite or requires up-keep cannot be offered on these terms, it is just impossible.<p>When a company is offering ""lifetime"", ""unlimited"", ""forever"" et al, the most likely reason is it is cash strapped and is hoping to raise some cash with these lucrative schemes. I, as a customer, am well aware about ""no free lunches"" but we are entering an agreement when I buy your supposedly ""lifetime"" plan.

For example proving a trend by using only land based surface temperatures, or only the past 30 years, or only the Northern Hemisphere, or neglecting the warming periods over the past 2000 years, or excluding the uncertainties of past reconstructions.

But, they touch on a set of related issues.<p>My assertion was that ""Just because software runs on multiple machines it does not mean that there is 'no SPoF'"".  You seem to have read this as saying ""in all cases where there are multiple machines, there is always a SPoF"".  In any case, I was trying to make a more general point, which is that (A) lots of cases which seem to have no SPoF, in fact do have SPoFs, (B) some cases get accused of having a SPoF, but doing so is a mistake, and Rabbit is in this category because you can set up a number of multi-machine scenarios with the required redundancy, and (C) in many cases having a SPoF is not a problem anyway, and may even be a good thing.<p>You said ""From what I can see in the docs, RabbitMQ is a client/server relationship. Meaning there is a server. Meaning a single point of failure and a bottleneck. I hate those.."".  With all due respect this represents a misunderstanding of Rabbit.  Moreover you assert that 'there is a server' means that there is a 'single point of failure'.  Because the conclusion does not follow from the premise, I assumed you must have meant something else.<p>Perhaps you could explain why you think your system has fewer 'bottlenecks' than RabbitMQ or other messaging systems.  I don't think that it does but would love to be enlightened.<p>From your more recent comment, you seem to be saying that using a DHT is a good thing.  Yes, I agree, sometimes this is the case.

It doesn't limit how many tokens you try to send out; I'm not entirely convinced this is an issue yet, since these tokens are 256 bit, so you'd have to create quite a few before random attempts would start working...\n2. The tokens do not expire.<p>Again, I know both of these are wrong, but I'm not sure what the appropriate way to deal with them is.<p>Limiting [1], i.e. the number of outstanding tokens, sounds like a bad idea, because then an attacker could lock the legitimate user out from being able to reset their password (barring a support call). Doing statistics on how many password reset requests are being made, per host and per credential, seems more efficient.<p>Adding a simple 24h lockout to [2] seems like a good idea, and it happens to be ridiculously simple to implement, too :)<p>Oh, by the way: tptacek, I sent you an e-mail weeks ago about a Pycon talk -- did you happen to get it perchance?",1350986875

3741599,comment,3739566,3741447,1,0,wonderzombie,,,"Someone in the test industry here. I had a stint in the games industry, as well.<p>An army of QA is... problematic. Inevitably it turns into a death march, which is a huge waste. Worse, developers feel much less inclined to own the quality of their code (consciously or unconsciously) because ""QA will catch it."" I suspect that even if you <i>wanted</i> to be more rigorous, the incentives are against you.<p>Fixing bugs filed by QA is also expensive, relative to fixing the code before it's checked in. By the time a bug makes it to QA, it's a ton of patches later, the developer is working on another feature, and it's not at all obvious which patch introduced the bug. The most expedient strategy of ""revert the culprit"" is difficult if not impossible, and checking in new code for a fix introduces further risk.<p>There's certainly something to be said for expert/exploratory testing. Hell, it puts food on my table. :) But as a tester, I'm far less inclined to work on a product where developers aren't concerned about code correctness or quality even at a micro level. It says to me that they don't value my time.<p>Then again, I suppose in the games industry it matters less what QA thinks, given that the people actually doing the testing are often temporary/contract employees.",1332445988

And you also have your own set of blinders on, which prevent you from seeing that if you can do this months or years ahead of your competition, over and over and over again, you ARE innovating.<p>Your blinders are so effective that you can't even see the straw men you keep setting up and knocking down. Nobody in this thread suggested that Apple ""invented tablets"" (which is absurd). Apple did invent one that people actually want to BUY, however. And no, Apple didn't invent 300dpi displays; they just got them into a product which still has decent battery life.

3741477,comment,3740438,3740438,15,0,kprobst,,,"One of the problems with Reddit in my experience is the spam filter. What happens is in the bigger subreddits (say, /r/pics or /r/funny) is that there seem to be people around who downvote stuff regardless of content, presumably to give their own posts a better chance. When your submissions consistently end up with -1 or -2 scores, the spam filter then decides that you are a spammer and you should be punished. Except in this case it's not for submitting spam, but because other people want their own submissions to have more visibility.<p>(As an aside, I obviously wouldn't be complaining about this if I had actually tried to spam reddit, my few submissions to date match the typical fare there)<p>Once the spam filter 'hates' you (as they put it) then subsequent submissions are 'ghosted' in the sense that you see them, but they don't appear in the /new section of the subreddit. Assuming you get wind of this (no downvotes, no comments, nothing) then you get to message the moderators, who may or may not respond in good time and restore your submission. By that time your obvious reaction is to delete and re-submit (because by now the post has drifted down the submission sort order), which apparently makes the spam filter hate you even more.<p>The problem I have with this is that by no fault of my own I ended up submitting things that were flagged as spam and hidden from view without any indication to me. You can see your posts, but no one else can. This might be a clever solution to deal with systemic spammers, but it's really annoying to normal users like me.<p>Karma games are fun and internet drama is lame of course; I don't lose sleep over this. But it's unfair to people who want to share something with the community. Of course you see reposts of lame memes that hit the front page and wonder why the picture of your cute hedgehog submitted in good faith ends up in the spam void.<p>There's supposed to be a user flag that tells the filter you're an approved submitter for a given subreddit; good luck getting that, I guess. So ultimately this makes me not want to submit anything. Right now reddit might not care about that because it has such a large user base, but I would remind them that Slashdot and Digg also thought they were invincible once.",1332444437

I figure that the cop <i>must</i> be following the law and going a safe speed for the conditions of the road, so I can use them as a benchmark for what is considered acceptable instead of having to rely on the purely advisory signs.<p>Funnily enough, the slow cops and coplike vehicles that bunch up traffic are usually the ones with the least jurisdiction and least likely to give out tickets. Town cops going one exit on a state road, inmate transfer, game wardens, etc. This could of course all be fixed by having speed limits that reflected society, and GPS tracking of cops to make sure they're not immune from the law.

If I don't know what the company does, I'm going to pass it off to the tips folder and it will probably die in obscurity.<p>2) The ""saw the post you wrote yesterday"" is not the approach you want. I cover social games be aware that I cover social games and make it relevant to that. Reading my last three posts is not enough to tailor a pitch, because we write about a lot of things and they aren't all necessarily on our beat.<p>3) Seriously, introduce yourself. Don't do it with a pitch let me know who you are and what you do. We do Q&As all the time with companies that have no news. You are 100x more likely to get published if I know who you are, what you do and why what you are doing is important.<p>4) How does this relate to normals? Most Twitter users don't actually Tweet. This is useful to me, but not necessarily my readers who are of utmost importance to me.<p>5) Know the publication you are pitching. Blind pitching everyone is a waste of time  if you are a social game developer, go for Inside Social, GamesBeat, TechCrunch, etc. Fast Company is not going to listen to you.<p>6) We have to rush through literally hundreds of pitches each day. Just because we phrased something differently than you'd like, if it is still factually accurate, you're going to upset a reporter if you try to nitpick on wording. I once encountered a PR person that was yelling at me because I didn't call an online deals site a ""mobile platform"" and, instead, an ""online deals site.""<p>7) Also, we do want to know what you think. Entrepreneur and founder input is valuable in just about any story. If some big news happens Steve Jobs resigns, for example  let us know what you think. When Jobs passed away, the first person I heard from was Box.net's Aaron Levie, who told me it was such a gargantuan loss and he was basically his idol and what made him want to become an entrepreneur. That, in of itself, is a story because Levie is running a company with a val of more than $500 million.<p>8) Don't be afraid to have a personal relationship with reporters  we aren't going to screw you, because blowing a relationship is worthless in this industry.<p>I'll add more as I think of it.",1332444166

No.  But on those projects we had an army of QA to test builds and producers obsessed with their features to always be in there making sure that things worked.

I guess what I'm asking is this: Is there a cure bit for kickbacks that are not just based on opt-in online registration.<p>Here's the scenario:<p>1. A referral source we typically use has someone that needs our services, that person's choice of who they use depends on our referrers (doctor, nurse, lawyer, receptionist)  recommendation.
2. A referrer then submits a lead via phone call, web, or txt (name,phone number, email).
3. Lead is verified (by our team) as a likely candidate (after phone or email contact is made). 
4. Once a certain number of verified leads is reached by that user, a monetary reward is presented. (2 leads = $50)
5. Milestones are reached once a certain number of leads are reached. (3 leads equals a $100, 10 leads equals 2 night resort stay).<p>System would still allow referrers (insert curebit style social reach) to recommend to others via social avenues like Facebook or twitter for example ""Anyone want to make $100? I just did by referring people that need ""insert service here"" to http://t.co/qwerty<p>Would have a site through Facebook or client hosted where referrers could check in/set up on their status and payouts.<p>Is there a startup out there already that anyone knows of (If there is please let me know because they're not asking for my cash for some reason) or is this just my bad idea that I should have kept to myself when applying to ycombinator's new incubator for non-technical kiddies with big ideas?",1332443700

Whatever you do, don't call yourself a freelancer.  You are missing out on the opportunity to present a much better image to your prospective clients.<p>Freelancer is bad, hacker is even worse.  You might as well have thrown rock star and ninja on the front page as well.<p>Quote from the front page...<p>""Hackers can focus on code, and clients get peace of mind.""<p>Sure, because these are the sorts of problems people who refer to themselves as freelancers or hackers have.  If this service isn't taking care of marketing, accounting, budgeting, business strategy, etc. then the hackers can't just focus on code.  If you need a service like this to give your clients peace of mind, then you probably shouldn't be doing client work.<p>If you guys really want to help connect people, then you should probably start by helping them get into the correct mind-set.  Prospective clients aren't looking for hackers, they are looking for professionals.<p>ETA:  This was a bit of a rant.  So, I suppose I should offer something constructive.  I think the service is fine, but I would change the message.  I could see clients being turned off by the choice of wording.  Also, you may want to provide different portals for clients and hackers / freelancers / ninja's / rock stars.  The client doesn't care about all the benefits to the developer and doesn't need to see those details.  Maybe a more simple ""find talent"" and ""find work"" page (like Elance) would be better?",1332443651

It is definitely a fuzzy line between ""new thing"" and ""old but better"", and your list has a bunch of must-have-every-single-day features that haven't always existed. I admit I'm glossing over the ""invisible"" work like Intel Mac support. I'm mostly interested in the interaction.<p>But - that list is fairly short, and things like nondestructive filters, hierarchical layer groups, type on a path, etc are exactly the codifying of manual processes I was talking about. They've certainly replaced duplicating layers and using complicated naming conventions to manage all the bloat.<p>So they're technically ""new features"", but they're not reinventing what folks can accomplish, or even altering the fundamentals of how one thinks about a task. That's a big accomplishment for software that has to please so many existing+trained users, and I'm looking forward to CS6 precisely because it seems focused on improvements to what people already do every day, rather than cool but rarely appropriate features like magic background fills and bending spoons.<p>We've been given a huge toolbelt to work with - the move from desktop software to web and tablets is going to be pretty awesome as we look at the whole belt through a new lens, and (potentially) significantly improve on everything from palette-oriented UI to how we manage discreet and grouped elements in a complex composition. Even more opportunity as Photoshop begins to acknowledge its expansion of purpose from photos and graphics to quickly comping high-fidelity interactive UIs.<p>Relative to all that's coming, Photoshop hasn't changed much.

Of course there is an exploratory spike here and there, with tests coming in later to glue it all together, but those are now exceptions to my normal practice.

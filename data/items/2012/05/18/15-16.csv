3992507,comment,3991173,3991173,2,0,FuzzyDunlop,,,"The general tone of what this person says just screams ""you're doing it wrong."" It lacks optimism, and the attitude is, as has been said, one of entitlement.<p>> <i>""Those 14 steps assume everything goes well and roughly according to plan.""</i><p>Yeah, definitely, if you plan to fail. Playing the numbers game with applications (sending off hundreds a month) is doing it wrong. He says he does research and tailors his applications to each one. With so many, they can't possibly be tailored enough. Those kinks will have been optimised out to save time.<p>Job hunting is a difficult and thankless task. But go about it the wrong way, with the wrong attitude, and it'll never get any better. Cutting the ""woe is me"" attitude and focussing more positively on what you can do to fix a shitty situation would be the first step.<p>I was in a position of thinking I'd never amount to anything, a couple of years ago. I spent 7 years in a supermarket, with only the faint tease of career prospects and progression (rapidly pulled away when I actually went for them). I thought I'd never get out, and I applied for all sorts of jobs (though not on the mass-production scale this fella has), slowly becoming bitter about them hiring other people over me.<p>Then I thought, ""what can I do to get out of this rut?"" I'd taught myself how to design and develop a website many years ago and for some bonkers reason didn't capitalise on that at the time (that's 7 years of good career progress I consciously chose not to take - no one's fault but mine). I got back into it and got a contact who gave me good work that I chose to do for free. It wasn't long before I was approached by an agency with the offer of a job. My first full-time position, at 23 years old. That was only 12 months ago.<p>It's been onwards and upwards ever since, even with recent redundancy.<p>Maybe if I'd done what this guy did, I would still be sending off 100 applications to any old job every month. The time spent doing that could easily have been spent making myself a more attractive prospect. After all, you're not being paid to 'troll' a jobsite 7 days a week, so you may as well do some unpaid work that puts you in a better position instead.",1337356610

3992503,comment,3991411,3991411,4,0,haberman,,,"Memristors promise to flatten part of the memory hierarchy, merging non-volatile storage and RAM.  But the interesting question to me as a systems programmer is whether they will ever merge cache with everything else too.  This question is really important because if there were no cache there would no longer be any benefit to compactness and locality in memory -- data structures distributed across large areas of the address space would be just as efficient as ones that are well-localized.<p>To be honest this idea worries me a little.  The performance advantage of small and local data structures is one of the main natural forces that encourages software to be small and simple.  Software tends to grow over time, both in size and complexity, especially when more people are involved.  Unchecked I fear that there would be no natural counterbalance to this tendency.<p>Put another way, I'm actually a bit glad that Eclipse is horribly slow, because it's an easy-to-observe symptom of the fact that it's a horribly complex stack of software.  If software like Eclipse could get by with acceptable performance because it had fast access to vast swaths of memory, it would be that much harder for an upstart competitor in this space (like Light Table) to be disruptive, because Eclipise would perform well enough that competing on speed doesn't impress.<p>I'm probably oversimplifying a bit, but I do think it generally good for programmers when simpler software also has better performance naturally.<p>But even if Memristors could be as fast as SRAM, could you out enough of it close enough to the CPU that it truly flattens the memory hierarchy completely?  This is where I hit the limits of my knowledge of computer architecture.",1337356568

3992450,comment,3989752,3991721,6,0,dgottlieb,,,"N.B. I use the term employer throughout where it really can also mean manager or generally anyone responsible for figuring out what employees would value as compensation/perks.<p>One thing I've noticed being an employee is that when employers try to get feedback in how to compensate their employees or what kind of perks they can additionally offer the question asked is usually, ""Is there anything I can do to make you happy?"" That question is vague and oftentimes sounds like it should be answered in the negative. The employee doesn't want to look needy of course. Instead, the employer should ask, ""Hey, are you happy with your hardware? You've been messing a lot with databases lately. Do you have enough RAM? Do you want some extra disks to mess with different RAIDs or filesystems?"" or maybe, ""Do you think we should get developers a second monitor? I really don't mind spending the money, it just never occured to me until now that it might be useful."" Once an employer actually opens up a dialogue with an explicit offer or idea, the feedback the employer wants to hear will much more likely flow naturally.<p>More specifically with a topic such as health insurance, I as an employee need to be given some idea of what options are on the table when it comes to ""improving"" my health insurance plan. Are we talking about the employer paying more of the insurance or perhaps am I concerned about the lack of a plan that offers an unlimited lifetime benefits clause.<p>I feel my job as an employee is to do work that adds value to the company. If the company wants to genuinely add value to my well-being, but wants it to be more thoughtful or mutually beneficial than a raise, the ball's in their court to be creative and come up with a list of starter ideas. Now I'm not averse to thinking of what would be useful, but a vague email, or even a 1 on 1 asking me what can be improved is unfortunately not going to get any feedback because my mind really won't turn its attention to thinking about that for the time necessary. A personal anecdote offered in lesson form:<p>A CEO of a startup may hold a discussion on company offered stock options, to fill in people on how it works on a compensation level. When questions come up that the CEO does not feel comfortable answering (considering he's not a certified accountant), a normal CEO will advise you to ask an accountant (accountant? I'm 22 years old, I don't have an accountant, should I take off work hours to find an accountant, go to an accountant and ask him/her?). A creative CEO will get an accountant in the office for a day and schedule those with questions to have a 1 on 1 meeting.",1337356076

I think the mental/emotional harm that this sort of fixation on 'startups' has on many people is understated - we mourn the loss of someone to suicide, but say ""he had other problems already"".

In the same breath there are many teachers who just skate by because they know they won't get fired.<p>The essay also doesn't take into account the length of a teachers workday nor the nature of the work.  When my wife taught she had to arrive at 6:30am and often didn't get home until 4:30 or 5:00pm on a good day. Have you ever tryed to entertain twenty 7-year-olds for 10 hours?

Relative to men and women who did not drink coffee, those who consumed three or more cups of coffee per day had approximately a 10 percent lower risk of death.""<p>Looking at the data to see if there is a dose response is a key issue in observational studies of this kind that many other studies miss. This isn't the last word on the subject, for the reason mentioned above and for other reasons mentioned in other comments, but at least here the study authors are treating coffee use as a quantitative independent variable and not just as a binary variable.<p>For the record, I began daily use of coffee (one cup each morning with breakfast) only after age forty. I asked around a long time before learning how to establish a habit that would not spiral into increasingly heavy use and physiological tolerance that would keep me upping my dosage for years and years and years. I come from a family with varying coffee-drinking habits but generally long lifespans.",1337354027

All you have to do is oversample everything by 3x horizontally (actually, even 2x works pretty well) and then pass it through a relatively simple scaling filter after final compositing. It doesn't make much diference for natural images, but anything vector with hard edges looks noticeably better with subpixel redering, and horizontal animation looks smoother regardless of the type of image. And if it were done at a low level like that, there would be no notion of switching smoothing modes during an animation.<p>I suppose a major problem is that this would require all programs to support the notion of non-square pixels, and it's late in the game to expect that. And once we have retina displays everywhere, the whole point will be moot.",1337353876

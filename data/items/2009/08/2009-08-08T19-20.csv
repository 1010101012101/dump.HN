749716,comment,749545,749662,0,0,Locke1689,,,"You're probably being voted down because you provide little evidence for your claims. It is practically impossible to ""logically deduce"" the result of certain elements of the economy because it is dependent on so many variables.<p>Consider, for example, the resistance in a wire. One might logically argue that because the power dissipated instantaneously in a resistor is equal to I^2 * R, that a decrease in resistance R leads to lower power (and heat) dissipation. Of course, that would be wrong, as that same resistor relates current to resistance by V=IR. Now, one can see that by decreasing the resistance by a factor of x (R/x), one also increases the current by a factor of x (xI, at a constant voltage). Thus, when the original problem is solved again, P=(xI)^2 * (R/x), so the power dissipation  is actually <i>increased</i> by a factor of x.<p>The economy works in the same way. To argue that taxes cause a decrease in first order capital may be true and may be a logical conclusion. <i>However</i>, logically deducing broad statements about the economy through that is a logical fallacy. The solution to this is data, not more reasoning. Remember, the variables you forget never appear in your equations.",1249760884

Money enhances your personal security just like social acceptance and bodily health do.  If you think of your brain as a tool for genetic fitness, it's quite clear that your brain actually badly underestimates the degree to which money enhances your ability to survive and reproduce in a first-world country.  If you have money, you're never dependent on the goodwill of others for food, shelter, and physical security.  If you fall out with your friends, girlfriend, or employer, money ensures your physical survival and gives you time to build new social relations.<p>It's interesting that our brains are able to grant money such deep significance.  I wonder how generic that ability is.  Does it apply to any object or substance that we think is a source of security -- like a gun, for some people, or a good-luck charm, for others -- or only to objects of recognized social value that we can trade for goodwill with others?  How easy is it for an object to assume that primal significance -- do me merely have to rationally <i>know</i> that it is valuable, or does it acquire that significance by repeated association over time?

749707,comment,749566,749566,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"And this time they're using x264; it seems like they value their bandwidth!<p>One thing that should be better-documented are Justin.TV-side bitrate restrictions; I assume that they don't want users broadcasting 1-2 megabit DVD-quality streams over their network, but nothing of the sort is listed in the guide.<p>Additionally, there's the matter of constant bitrate requirements: H.264 streaming works under a leaky buffer model based on two parameters, the rate and buffer size.  For optimal performance Justin.TV should document what buffer size they set on the viewers' Flash players so that the encoder settings can be set accordingly.  For example, let's say that Justin.TV uses a 2 second buffer:<p>I pick a constant bitrate of 500kbps. (bitrate=500)<p>I set the maxrate to 500. (vbv-maxrate=500)<p>I set the bufsize to 500x2 = 1000. (vbv-bufsize=1000)<p>If the buffer in the encoder is <i>greater</i> than that used by Justin.TV, it's possible for the stream to drop out for viewers during local bitrate spikes, so getting it right is important, especially at higher bitrates (at 300kbps you probably don't have to care much).<p>Another issue to note is latency.  Total latency in a connection is as follows:<p>(Encoder-side latency) + (Network latency) + (Decoder buffer size)<p>x264's default encoder-side latency is about 40 frames in the latest version; if anyone's interested in how to lower that for a low-latency stream, I can give more information.",1249760459

Even though in the spirit in which it was offered, it aligns one axis of the issue at hand, with one axis of the offered analogous situation, the listener instead may focus on -- and comment about -- every other dimension of the two things that are wildly different.<p>For some thinkers, all those other differences are easy to factor out -- of course they're different in those dimensions, and the wild variance only serves to highlight the similarity-in-one-dimension-of-interest.

I don't mind if someone sits there for 10+ hours a day if they keep on buying food and coffee regularly, and I know I've sat at a table for hours on end working but even went as far as to make a timer on my laptop to get up every like 30 minutes to go get something. But it's crass to sit there like ""oh, this seat is mine, I bought ONE small cup of coffee 3 hours ago, stop looking at me like that"".<p>It's one thing for a coffee shop to look busier by having a whole bunch of people sit there and work away, attracting passers-by, but it's another when people who don't buy anything just hog the tables preventing new customers from coming in because they see a total lack of available work space.<p>That being said, I remember once when I was at a family friend's coffee shop and there was one customer who just. wouldn't. leave. He was told about their time limit policy about customers getting x hours with purchase (rarely enforced...except with people like these) and he was like ""whatever"" and acted like he was going to buy something but then settled back in and worked. I saw this go on for 20 minutes when I decided to boot him off the wifi. I don't think he realized I was purposefully doing so until I kept on kicking him off, and the outrage on his face was unbelievable.

This distracts people enough so that Microsoft has enough time to come up with SenderID, which co-opts the data format of SPF allowing MS to say they are trying to be compatible when it really subverts the intent of the standard.  They also claimed they may or may not have patent interests but won't say exactly what they are, that will have to wait until after everything is standardized and the patents are filed--because since this is such an innovative idea Microsoft is being kind enough to file patents so that the community and standard is protected in the event someone else is waiting with a submarine patent, even though the IETF discourages standards that are patent encumbered.  Microsoft gets to say it is trying to work with the community, and through press releases and public policy statements confuses the goals and intent of SPF and SenderID.

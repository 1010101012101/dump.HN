I've often thought about this within more narrow verticals (e.g. programming).<p>I like to learn using iTunes U, but it would be nice to have those video lectures included in a broader curriculum recommendation from somebody whose credentials I trust.<p><Off-topic rant for your consideration>: Personally, it would be nice to force me into a certain timeline. Perhaps using some form of calendar style metaphor where I can check things off as I complete them and it lets me know if I'm getting behind (or even how I'm doing compared to the average). Maybe it's just me, but sometimes it is nice to have some enforced discipline when learning.  Further to this idea, imagine if an author could create a curriculum and then constrain it to what they considered an optimal timeline; that way a group of learners could be working through the curriculum simultaneously - asking questions in the forum about ""this week's task"" etc. Or meeting up with other local learners.  Then again if you had enough learners participating, there would always be someone at the same stage in the material as you anyway. Maybe I just miss my undergrad years :(<p>Anyway, I really like the idea;  would love to know how you will recruit curriculum authors with the necessary credibility.",1270594295

Where you run into trouble is when you fall in love with your solution to the exclusion of seeing the actual problem.<p>I once had a boss/mentor who believed that teachers should have a nation-wide lesson plan repository. He lamented that there was no way to get teachers to use even the most ""simple"" version control system (e.g. TortoiseSVN). I realize you're doing more than lesson plans, but you may want to consider teachers as a good first market.<p>That brings me to my next point: make sure you find out who your market is _soon_. This advice is old-hat for HN folks but its worth repeating:<p>1) Read up on mvp [1]. Create a ""smoke test"" to see if you're even in the right universe. We could psyche you up and tell you this the best idea ever, but until you verify that with The Internet you don't really learn anything<p>2) Read Steve Blank's book [2]. Get out of your bubble of encouraging friends and contacts and, say, find some teachers and ask them if they would _pay_ for that sort of service. (Find people who have a problem, know they have a problem, have hacked together a solution, and who are willing to _pay_ for a better solution.)<p>It's these visionary customers who are really the only ones who can answer this question for you.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cafepress.com/kandsranch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cafepress.com/kandsranch</a>",1270593566

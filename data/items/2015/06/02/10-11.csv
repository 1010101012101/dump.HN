This out-gassing increases pressure in the battery. Eventually, the excess pressure either ruptures the insulating seals at the end of the battery, or the outer metal canister, or both.</i><p>In other words by extracting more energy, there is more hydrogen evolved and it <i>will</i> increase their tendency to leak.<p>This was also posted on an EE forum I frequent, and the opinions on it so far have been mostly negative:<p><a href=""http://www.eevblog.com/forum/reviews/&#x27;batterizer&#x27;-claims-to-increase-disposable-battery-life-8x/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eevblog.com/forum/reviews/&#x27;batterizer&#x27;-claims-to-...</a><p>IMHO rechargeable lithium is the way to go.

So, to begin with, you&#x27;ll discard ~10% of your energy.<p>Now look at AA alkaline discharge curves: <a href=""http://www.powerstream.com/AA-tests.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.powerstream.com/AA-tests.htm</a><p>Indeed if you gadget reports the batteries as dead at 1.25V, you can still get ~40% more usage. But most gadgets don&#x27;t work that way. 1.25V is the normal voltage of a fully charged NiMH rechargeable AA, so if you gadget works with those, the real cutoff point is likely closer to 1.15V or so.<p>The booster will boost the voltage (at the expense of current, obviously, plus losses) so that even though the battery will be below 1.15V, output voltage will be at 1.5V. Looking at the graphs, this buys you less than 1/5th, and if you consider the losses in the boost converter, probably half that.<p>The &quot;800%&quot; claim seems totally bogus. Perhaps with a gadget that stops working when the voltage falls below 1.45V per cell.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not a useful gadget (and I&#x27;m very impressed by the miniaturization: where is the inductor?

There are analogue effects too - if an instruction happens to make the right set of transistors switch in a certain way, going past the estimated margins, power supply fluctuations and crosstalk could flip a bit or two. Sometimes these bit-flips don&#x27;t cause any problems since it happens in an unused part of the logic, but sometimes they do.

Be prepared to be undercut by the competition.  It&#x27;s pretty cutthroat.<p>2. Agencies.  I know a number of successful contractors who work through headhunting agencies.  Downside is the overhead they add to the contract.<p>3. Networking networking networking.<p>In the case of the latter, in the beginning it&#x27;ll be networking through your peers.  Join user groups, industry trade groups, local entrepreneurial meetups, that sort of thing.  And make sure you stay in touch with your colleagues... you&#x27;ll never know when some company they&#x27;re working for puts a project out for tender.<p>Once you have a few contracts under your belt, if you&#x27;re good they&#x27;ll lead to more thanks to referrals, and that can pretty quickly snowball.<p>If you go this path the best advice you can probably get isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;d expect: be prepared to say no!  The quickest way to fail as a contractor is to take on too much work too quickly.  At the beginning folks are usually paranoid and take on anything that comes their way, but trust me, that way lies madness!<p>Edit: As an aside, it&#x27;s worth noting there&#x27;s different types of contracting, and you should decide what, exactly, you want to do.  A few examples I can think of:<p>1. Discrete project contracts.  You bid to produce a solution, after which you offer some sort of support or maintenance contract.  You probably give up the IP in this case, as it&#x27;s work-for-hire.<p>2. Contract positions.  You&#x27;re brought in as labour on a new or existing project.  Oftentimes specialized skills are valuable, here, as you&#x27;re often brought in to fill a gap in the existing skillset, whether that&#x27;s project management, design or architecture experience, or specific technical skills.<p>3. Really a variant of the first, and is what I think of as contract-to-product.  You bid on an initial contract to build a product, after which you provide follow-up services to expand that product on some regular basis.  This could be done by billing out on a line item basis, or via a retainer of some kind.  It&#x27;s possible in some cases to retain rights to the IP for a job like this.<p>So think carefully about what you want to do.  Each model has pros and cons and may effect how you bid, what skills you develop, etc.",1433240101

With the addition of Spark the Hadoop platform is looking like being the first choice for analysing data sets whether small or big. And whilst I am sure SQL has and will continue to be a major part of that it won&#x27;t be the only approach. There will be R, PMML, Python, Scala and a whole lot more.<p>That aside Facebook having a buy versus build decision to make seems pretty strange.

You aren&#x27;t searched unless you enter a store which has a bag policy because of a theft issue.<p>As for buses and trains, I am quite sure there are guards and cameras, just no oppressive searching of luggage or your person.<p>Once they can make it like &quot;The Running Man&quot; portrayed I won&#x27;t have much of a problem with it but I don&#x27;t think the tech is quite there yet",1433239210

Add some low level not too obtrusive adverts in (you will get a nice trickle of money in)<p>From my own experience of putting adverts into a util app (<a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teazel&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teazel&hl=...</a>) no-one minds at all. The key is to not go overboard. We have banners that don&#x27;t refresh too often, disappear if they going to draw over a dice. The number of apps I see show full screen adverts at start up, every page transition etc - all very icky.<p>2. As others have said try and grow it and use it for Resume/CV building. My one reservation on this is make sure you actually try and capitalise on it. I’m reminded of friends staying in awful jobs due to the \ntraining/experience and years later never really harvesting the rewards.<p>3. Use it to cross promote another app (either by yourself or sell the space). Getting an app to be downloaded is so hard now having this to kick start the next project is a great de-risker.<p>I would go for option 1 or 3 depending on whether you have other apps in the pipeline.<p>As an aside is this lightweight wrapping of a webapp model work for other providers? LinkedIn etc?",1433239205

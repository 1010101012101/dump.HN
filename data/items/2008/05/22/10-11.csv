197042,comment,196558,196558,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"Strange article.<p>The author writes: ""Given that Wikipediaâ€™s stated vision is to give <i>every single person in the world free access to the sum of all human knowledge</i>, you might guess it was started by scientists eager to collect all of human knowledge into a single source.  [...] Even today, contributing to Wikipedia is regarded as a low-value activity by most professional scientists.""<p>What he seems to be ignoring is that the means that Wikipedia chose also allows ""read/write"" access to that ""sum total of human knowledge,"" and that part of the reason that scientists might regard editing Wikipedia as a ""low-value"" activity is that their contributions stand a significant chance of being reverted or mangled by pretty much anyone with a keyboard.",1211452625

197037,comment,196668,196668,0,0,chris_l,,,"From wikipedia: ""Instinct is the inherent disposition of a living organism toward a particular behavior. Instincts are generally inherited patterns of responses or reactions to certain kinds of stimuli.""<p>I don't think you want to follow this in running your startup. I would rather recommend Intuition, or following a higher, above-rational understanding, rather than your animal reflexes. Intuition is most effective when not clouded by emotions, hence by becoming emotionally detached you can better use Intuition.",1211451943

197031,comment,196370,196383,0,0,1gor,,,"Your concern is valid, but a bit misplaced. Rentec is actually one of the (very) few funds that seem not to bullshit their investors and have a fully rational investment strategy.<p>Majority of 'hedge' funds are simply volatility sellers in one form or another. They run disproportionate and unannounced risks of instant death. Again, it seems like Renaissance is not this type of a firm, even though it can have a few bad months.",1211451687

But I think he's wrong to say that there isn't any technological solution - you just have to do away with the idea that everyone is equal.<p>How about this as a solution:\n* Everyone can write comments.\n* Only moderators can vote on comments\n* Only moderators can submit articles\n* The number of moderators is fixed (at say... 1000?)\n* If a moderator hasn't moderated in the last 3 months, they are removed from the moderator list, opening up a vacancy.\n* The person that replaces the removed moderator is the commenter with the highest average point score for their comments (ie total points/number of posts), provided they have posted in the last month. It may be necessary to add a minimum total points score as well (say 100 points, and then it's the person with at least 100 points, and the highest average that becomes moderator).<p>This type of system should ensure that only things that interest people that themselves have been found to have interesting things to say will get voted up.  There will still be trolls, but they won't be voted up.",1211451057

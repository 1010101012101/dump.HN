2729374,comment,2729070,2729219,3,0,nhaehnle,,,"Since other commenters focus on the negative effects of the default, let me explain the potential <i>positive effects for the citizens of the country</i> of a default combined with an exit of the Euro in the case of Greece. (There are no potential positive effects of a default for the US.)<p>The major problem that is facing Greek citizens these days is that because the Greek government's hands are tied in monetary things, the country cannot achieve its full potential.<p>Since Greece was a net importer for a long time, money has been leaving the main part of the Greek economy [1]. Now Greeks no longer have as much money to afford imports - which would be only fair in some sense - but worse than that, they no longer have money to pay each other. This is what causes the very high unemployment in Greece.<p>Now you would say, if you have person A who would like to sell to person B, and person B who would like to sell to person A, and neither of them have any money, they could still do their transaction, and so not having any money to pay each other is not a problem. That is true in this very simple scenario.<p>The real modern economy is much more complex than that, and situations where two people genuinely just trade with each other almost never occur. So Greece has become stuck, people are unemployed, which means that the country is not reaching its productive potential.<p>By re-introducing its own currency, the Greek government could restart the spending cycle.<p>It is without doubt that a new Greek currency (NGC) would immediately drop in value compared to other currencies. There is nothing that can be done about that, and it is the reason why a reintroduction of NGC needs to go along with a default (or a technical default where the debts are revalued once in NGC, so that the exchange rate no longer matters).<p>It is also true that the short-term pain for Greeks would not go away immediately. Imports would be very expensive in NGC and difficult to afford, but this is not that much different from the current situation where imports are difficult to afford because the money is missing.<p>Most importantly, the Greek government would be able to introduce an economic expansion program to put people to work, so that the real capacity of Greece itself would be used fully to the benefits of Greek citizens.<p>Edit: I should add that this scenario has already played out in the case of developing countries and particularly many times in South America, e.g. in Argentina.<p>[1] Of course, there are also very rich Greeks. However, they save their money and don't invest in Greece at this time (because the economy is bad), so their money does not enter into the picture.",1309863415

My memory of every paper I ever wrote for school and for my first day job is pretty slim.  Every word I've written since that is accessible with about ten seconds of reflection and Google.  Much of the important stuff is accessible on my iPad, too.  (The additional accessibility of it makes it easier to re-read, which keeps it in active memory, too.)<p>I'm in paperwork-filing mode right now for immigration.  I've done it before, largely backed by paper notes.  It is stressful, highly technical, and not my field.  This time, I'm backed by Dropbox and my iPad.  I have literally asked for a moment during discussions with clerks at town hall and then read sentences from the relevant Ministry of Justice regulations directly to them.  (""I need a document proving that I have properly executed my duty to pay all forms of tax for last year, including that from $YOUR_OFFICE.  Can you help me out with that?  No?

Many institutions hold first-world sovereign debt as supposedly almost risk-free investments with guaranteed (fixed-income) returns. These institutions include banks, pension funds and other investment funds and vehicles into which both corporates and individuals will have invested their money.<p>Plus you also have those that have insurance against a sovereign default, largely through credit default swaps (CDS). However unlike many forms of insurance, you don't need to actually own the bond to take out a CDS on it. In this way many people will trade the risk of a Greek default without actually going anywhere near the physical asset. Being a derivative product, the size of the CDS market on Greek debt is likely to be many, many, many times greater than the size of the underlying basket of bonds.<p>So if Greece defaults - or even ""technically"" defaults, which could include the proposed rollover into longer-dated bonds  - this could have huge implications for people who are short this insurance.  They're all going to have to pay out.<p>Apart from the direct financial impact, with Greece you have the additional embarrassment and complication due to being part of the Euro. Greece may be forced to leave the single currency, which is going to be a costly and messy exercise, and severely damage the reputation and credibility of the currency.",1309862426

Actual numbers can easily be found, here's a secondary source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Estimated_ownership_of_treasury_securities_by_year.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Estimated_ownership_of_tre...</a><p>So less than one third is held by foreigners. This is more than for most other countries, but keep in mind that much of world trade is still run in US$ - this is what people (hopefully) mean when they say that it is a quasi-reserve currency, which naturally drives up demand for US$-denominated financial assets.<p>Second, the fact that so much of those assets are held by foreigners has greatly benefited US citizens up to this point in time, because the foreigners holding those assets obtained them by selling their products to the US. So the US was able to receive a lot of real, physical goods that cost actual physical resources and work to produce, in exchange for the US simply running a computer system on which accounts are managed. If you ask me, that is a very good deal.<p>Now, once China gets their act together and becomes able to change their economy into one that is not so export-heavy, they will sell of their assets over time. This will force the US to become a nation with net exports again.<p>But from the perspective of US citizens, the worst case is that the US enjoys more physical resources (than it would be able to without trade) now at the cost of enjoying less (than they would be able to without trade) in the future. And in fact, they cannot even be forced to take that full hit in the future, because they could always choose to inflate the debt away.<p>Now you may say that you would rather suffer a decrease in resources that you can enjoy <i>now</i> than suffering that decrease in the future. That is a reasonable political stance.<p>However, the reality is that especially China is hell-bent on sending real goods to the US in exchange for paper. Trying to cut the budget deficit or to reduce debt directly is not going to change that. In fact, it will hurt US citizens long before it will hurt China.<p>The only way to stop the flow of financial assets towards foreigners is via a combination of trade barriers and helping China to turn their economy into a domestic-consumption-based economy.",1309861815

Personally I write the bulk of my code on embedded systems where we are severly constrained both in sheer CPU performance, but also in the amount of memory available.  Nevertheless, I still start off writing code in what you might call a ""lazy"" style, but which I tend to think of as ""the simplest, clearest way to write code to do the job"".  I assume I'll have the memory and the performance that I need.  Having written the code, if that assumption turns out to be false, only then do I go back and try to improve performance characteristics - adding caching, optimising algorithms to avoid doing unnecessary calculations, and so on.  The code is inevitably longer, and less flexible,  after this work which means that I have probably added in bugs during the process.  And that is why I don't start off doing things that way, I'm trying to keep the LOC count (and hence the bug count) down as much as possible.  Memory and performance optimisations are done <i>only</i> when the is a demonstrated need for them, and I feel that this is the <i>correct</i> way to approach optimisation.",1309861410

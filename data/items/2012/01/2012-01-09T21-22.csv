It's always fun when Facebook decides to change the API when you're in the middle of a project, but keep backwards compatibility and only ""hide"" the documentation for the old API so you can't find it with search, and now you're left with trying to decide if you should try to keep using the old interface or change your whole code for the new API.",1326146392

RightSignature charges $14/mo for unlimited documents.<p>I enjoy the workflow of RightSignature. I upload the doc/PDF of the contract, or import for Google Docs. I find the fields that need to be filled in, highlight them, and designate who fills it in (me or the counterparty).<p>I then fill in text fields using a text entry box and the signature using my mouse. They have a good system for tracking the mouse speed to show the width of the line, and the signatures look quite good with minimal effort.<p>When you want a counterparty to sign, they get an email asking them to follow a link. They then can fill in the fields and sign, without registering for the site. Finally, we both get a PDF of the final contract, and they store the final PDF on their site. You cannot ""delete"" the contract from their site once it has been executed, which corresponds to the gut feeling that the contract is cannot be undone (without executing a contract that overrides it).<p>I also think their design looks serious and conveys to proper gravity to a contract signing process.",1326146336

You can unlock cosmetic skins purely by paying. You can temporarily enhance the speed at which you unlock players by paying.<p>You can never play a dollar and play at the top level of the game.<p>Some people certainly pay hundreds of dollars to play the game, but many pay $0. Many people who are busy pay some money and then are able to gather the characters that time rich and cash poor players then spend their time to achieve.<p>As to more generic DLC that isn't currency based (A la Mass Effect), I <i>love</i> that stuff. Video games have cost $40-60 bucks for all time. They cost that in 1981, and they cost that in 2011. By putting DLC in, they can not raise that price yet actually make more money only off the people who really like the game and wish to go deep into it.<p>For instance, I have bought the DLC for Oblivion, as I loved that game (it added about 20 hours of quests in another world). However, I've largely avoided the DLC in lots of other games that I've bought the other game. Therefore, I pay more for games I enjoy more, and pay less for games I enjoy less. Sounds like perfection in pricing to me.<p>Many people who don't like the more normal type of DLC wouldn't like the game costing $15 bucks more either. But that's the alternative really, or scaling back the base game.",1326146187

Sure, it's different, but in Gosu for example you can write an enhancement method on the Collection interface, or on the List interface, and now everything that implements Collection or List has that method.  It's then a matter of whether or not the objects in question implement that appropriate interface or not.  Your new functions apply to everything that implements those interfaces, and if you want a new thing to have all those methods then you just implement the interface and you get all 50+ functions for free.<p>Scala offers a particular way to solve that problem that has its own plusses and minuses, but it's not the only way for a language to let you do that, and it's certainly not the ""simplest"" way to accomplish that goal.",1326146160

What we call pirating might be okay, but the idea that because something is easy to do it shouldn't be illegal is flawed. Attempting murder is arguably just as easy as downloading a pirated version of a game, but it's not okay.

The flag will come with documentation that if you enable it, you take the responsibility.<p>Haskell (well, the GHC compiler) has been doing this kind of things for ages. They even take the further step (which I agree with) of requiring that ""dangerously powerful"" features be explicitly enabled on a per-case basis. They also have a syntax for enabling features on a per-file basis, which reduces the likelihood of advanced techniques creeping into other parts of your codebase.<p>I think your proposition is a good idea, and heartily recommend a review of how the GHC team has adressed this problem.",1326146016

Readers often form into communities, like Hacker News. If there are comments on a blog post, are you supposed to write your comment here in your community? Or there on the post? Well, a good question is, are you a member of the author’s community? Probably not! Communities have all sorts of standards for participation. What are the author’s standards? Why bother figuring them out for one comment?<p>Communities also have other tools like seeing a person's history of posts to get a sense of their viewpoint and biases. How do you do that on an author’s blog?<p>Ultimately, authors either have to get rid of comments or buy into a plug-in system like Disqus. In my own case, I usually just provide a link to HN for posts that I think are of interest to the folks here. Everyone else can use twitter, reddit, or their own blogs to continue the discussion.<p>That doesn’t mean I won’t read all the flames, there are no end of analytics tools for discovering what people are saying about my writing.<p>I don’t speak for this author, but considering he has a link to this discussion right at the top of his post, I’m guessing he’s listening to your thoughts and welcomes your feedback right here or wherever people congregate to discuss the news of the day.",1326145604

This is one of the few statements you can make about all forms of life, from viruses to blue whales.

If the compiler can't tell statically, then it just assumes they're not aliased.<p>I'm basing this conclusion mainly on this statement from that piece on aliasing: <i>Essentially, compilers are promised (by the standard and, therefore, by programmers who write code they claim to be standard-conforming) that if they cannot detect aliasing via static analysis of a single program unit's EQUIVALENCE and COMMON statements, no such aliasing exists. In such cases, compilers are free to assume that an assignment to one variable will not change the value of another variable, allowing it to avoid generating code to re-read the value of the other variable, to re-schedule reads and writes, and so on, to produce a faster executable</i>",1326145564

The MakerBot assembly instructions are horribly out of date and can be misleading. The software UI is kind of flaky. The support documentation is not very helpful and is filled with errors. I'd be very concerned about buying something preassembled by that crew. They seem nice, but more focused on being hip than ""Six Sigma"".<p>That said, I'm happy with my machine so far.

Surely we all know here that number crunching wasn't C's domain to begin with.  It was writing an OS (UNIX) on 2 slightly different machines.<p>But even more disturbing, are you seriously suggesting that being able to manage the freaking <i>memory</i> makes you closer to <i>number crunching</i>? Sorry for the emphasis, but I <i>am</i> astonished.  Manual memory management (and unrestricted pointers for that matter) are about the hardware.  They are about manual tweaking of implementations.  They are definitely not about number crunching.<p>And even if they were, I take one goal of number crunching is to milk every single cycle out of your CPU farm.  As far as I know, C loses that match to Fortran.<p>> <i>If you want to do performant number crunching with most other languages, you have to not only grasp the language, but also the underlying virtual machine or compiler.</i><p>This is already the case with C.  It has been a few years (decades?) since C code and assembly no longer match neatly at all.  GCC optimized assembly code is such a mess that I see it as hermetic magic.  Heck, even the performance model of modern CPU is half magic to me.<p>Now you <i>are</i> correct.  I'm just saying that it applies to C as well.<p>But there is hope. The Viewpoint Research Institute, with their STEPS project, managed to write a complete compilation suite in about two thousands lines of code.  It's not optimized for runtime speed, but it does suggest that it might eventually be manageable.  Here is their last report: <a href=""http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2011004_steps11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2011004_steps11.pdf</a><p>> <i>Sure, you can use fast implementations of common algorithms in a high-level language.

I am not often performance-limited on the ATMega328, except for applications involving lots of high-resolution PWM, which wouldn't fit on such a device due to its limited array of IO pins.<p>#2 is interesting, though I wonder how long the Dip28 format will remain relevant. The LeafLabs people have tried doing the straight-line upgrade path from Arduino by designing a board with the same form factor, but your idea is even more elegant. I might use a handful of these for prototyping.<p>#3 sounds a lot like the Maple board. The crucial thing here is the growth path from protoboards up to custom circuits. The STM32Discovery board is cheap and capable, but its toolchain story is totally fucked (windows only proprietary uploader, undocumented protocol!), so it ends up being useless for prototyping. The Maple board is good, but it is hampered by the use of the Arduino IDE. It's really easy to outgrow the editor's constraints when you are developing for a Cortex-M3 chip, but it's not easy at all to break your project out into a gcc/makefile/upload type world. At least, I've had no luck making it work.<p>#3+#4 sounds like you're reinventing Arduino shields, no? Again, maple did basically the same thing and it seems to work out ok.<p>I don't think you need to worry about collision with Raspberry Pi, despite the price-point overlap. Not in the near term, at least, simply because of power consumption and complexity. It's a miniature computer, not a beefy microcontroller; I generally don't <i>want</i> an operating system getting in my way when I'm building embedded stuff.<p>Arduino took over because it offered a totally unbeatable development experience and didn't try to box you in. It's about as simple a process as one could possibly expect: you write code, pick a target board, push ""upload"", and it runs. It's all open standards under the hood, and they document everything you need to know about the board design, so there's no vendor lock-in anywhere. Mimic this strategy and you will go far. In fact I would say that your toolchain is <i>more</i> important than the capabilities of your board! Anyone who is capable of pushing through a dodgy toolchain to get their prototypes working is probably capable of building their own devboards, or of adapting some existing devboard to their needs. The real market opportunity comes from offering a seamless experience to beginners which still allows them a smooth upgrade path out of your environment. Beginners don't stay beginners forever, but the Arduino experience shows that ex-beginners will stick with your brand and buy your products as a convenience even once they've moved on and learned how to design their own, but only if you make it easy for them to outgrow you.",1326144784

Which is actually quite an appropriate analogy, since it is often easier (IMHO) to think profoundly about something you're reading (where you control the tempo), in comparison to a video, where you constantly have to follow their tempo. Yes, you can rewind, but if you do that, I think you'd agree with me that it'd be easier with a transcript.",1326144756

3444362,comment,3443436,3443436,6,0,hp,,,"One source of Scala's design is Java interoperability, much as C++ has to live with its C legacy. This compromise may also be why people are able to use Scala in practice, though; they need to talk to Java libraries or need the performance of a language that maps straightforwardly to the JVM.<p>Scala is a functional/object-oriented hybrid, making it more complex than a purist language in either mold. It always lets you do things in a Java-like way - you can use it as ""Java with less boilerplate"" and touch almost nothing Scala-specific. Then it adds functional programming alongside.<p>To me this feels very natural; I like objects for the big-picture structure, but I like to write algorithms and manipulate data in functional style. If you need raw performance in some hotspot, write a Java-like while loop with mutable state; otherwise, write something nice and high-level (and the JVM will still be much faster than a ""scripting language"" however you define it, e.g. <a href=""http://blog.j15r.com/2011/12/for-those-unfamiliar-with-it-box2d-is.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.j15r.com/2011/12/for-those-unfamiliar-with-it-bo...</a>).<p>Scala does fix some Java warts that are legitimately complex or confusing in their own right. For example, primitive and boxed types are less strongly separated; there's no ""static"", just nice syntax for singleton objects; collections are 100x nicer with far less noise; a nice multiple inheritance design; covariance eliminates a bunch of nasty hacks; better ways to specify access controls; there's a decent way to factor out exception handling; case matching is _awesome_; and _so_ much less boilerplate in general.<p>I'm not sure the static vs. dynamic religious war can ever be resolved, but static types feel less broken and less verbose in Scala than in Java. Java makes you lie to the type system, or do something unnatural, much too often. Scala hasn't cured every such situation, but it's cured a lot of the most common ones, and greatly reduced the need for manual type annotations.<p>Scala gives you the conciseness of Ruby, but with static type checking, higher runtime performance, and interoperability with existing Java code.<p>Some tradeoffs of static type checking remain, such as compilation times.<p>People do go on wild goose chases trying to push the language farther than it's ready to go. I've done it myself. I agree with the article that there are lots of areas to improve and appreciate the constructive write-up.<p>But on the other hand, the perfect shouldn't be the enemy of the good. I certainly would not choose to go back to Java, even as I'd love to keep seeing Scala get even better.",1326144732

3444285,comment,3443436,3443436,57,0,modersky,,,"First, I think a blog post ending with ""bring on the flames"" should have comments enabled, otherwise it's not really fair. It comes across as whining without wanting to listen to advice or a response.<p>Second, I think the blog post is useful because it shows what's wrong with some (fortunately very small) part of the Scala ecosystem, and because it points to a way to fix it.<p>Here's a quick recap: The author tries to add arbitrary operations to Scala's Seq abstraction without changing its source code and wants them to work also on arrays (which are plain old Java arrays), without any extra work. Arrays in Java support: length, index, and update; that's it. There is as far as I know no language in existence that allows the precise thing the author wants to achieve. And there are many variations, such as adding only to Seq or only to Array that would be really easy in Scala but still impossible in most other mainstream languages. The author then throws all the machinery he can think of at the problem to still achieve the same non-result. Well, tough luck. He might have hit a thing that's simply impossible to do in a generic way, given the tools we currently have. In fact, I have not checked whether there would be a way to achieve the result that he wants because that's beside the point. There are always limits to a generic formulation that will force you at some point to treat things on a case by case basis.<p>The problem is that, in trying to achieve his impossible goal, the author (mis-)uses a lot of the most powerful features of Scala, and concludes that Scala is simply too complex for helping him achieve the result. I believe he wrote this blog post to prompt the maintainers of Scala to add even more power to the language so that he can achieve his goal (the only other motivation I can think of is that he's trying to actively damage the ecosystem he writes code in, but that would make no sense to me).<p>My response will probably not please him. I think that we need to take away sharp knifes from people who have a tendency to cut themselves. I was always proud that in Scala you could do in a library where in other languages you had to change the compiler. Inevitably, some of this is cutting edge stuff. We have tried many times to clarify the boundaries, for instance when I defined the Scala levels<p><a href=""http://www.scala-lang.org/node/8610"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scala-lang.org/node/8610</a><p>But we can't prevent a developer who prides himself to ""stroll right through level L3"" to get hurt.<p>So, I believe here is what we need do: Truly advanced, and dangerously powerful, features such as implicit conversions and higher-kinded types will in the future be enabled only under a special compiler flag. The flag will come with documentation that if you enable it, you take the responsibility. Even with the flag disabled, Scala will be a more powerful language than any of the alternatives I can think of. And enabling the flag to do advanced stuff is in any case much easier than hacking your own compiler.<p>I would be interested to read your comments on this proposal.",1326143619

3444244,comment,3443436,3443436,4,0,dxbydt,,,"Regarding some of the ""brainteasers"" posted in the article, I am assuming that most of them are simply bugs that will get ironed out in version 2.9.2 or thereabouts ?<p>eg. The following fails:<p>Set(1,2,3).toIndexedSeq sortBy (-_)<p>But doing the same in 2 steps, ie. after assignment, works<p>val xs = Set(1,2,3).toIndexedSeq; xs sortBy (-_)<p>I have been bitten by this several times now, so I don't unnecessarily chain > 2 functions even if it does compile ( which also solves one other brainteaser posed in that article )\nHave also seen the problem with the add function, when I wrote a matrix manipulation library.<p>def add(x: Int, y: Int) = x + y<p>add(1,_) fails, but add(_,_) works. Even though the error message "" missing parameter type for expanded function"" seems reasonable, and providing the parameter type ie. add(1,_:Int), does compile, the bahavior is hard to explain to newbies.<p>His point about hanging your hat on asInstanceOf[...] and the resulting code being clumsy...ok, guilty as charged, but then you only have so many hours in a day, and mgmt is paying $$ to solve boring business problems ( compute the asset quality of five million loans in thirty lines of business over twelve quarters using scala ) and not mucking around ( add a filterMap to the scala collection library to get an idiomatic Scala implementation )<p>I enjoyed the programming snippets in the article very much, but I still don't get what the point of the rant was. He goes on and on about ""lack of acknowledgement of complexity"", but what does that really mean ? Does he want like a gold star ? Even if everybody acknowledges that scala is complex, what then ? Eventually some of it will get fixed & the rest will not & life will go on. Why be a downer at such an early phase of growth of the language ? All this talk of excess  complexity will simply scare off the early adopters. Java has been around for 15 years and we still don't have decent generics. Scala is so far ahead in such a short time.

I have learned some by taking open source projects that needed to do the same kind of statistical test I needed and studying their code, and adapting it for my needs (unfortunately my needs were sufficiently different from those of the open source project that nothing worth contributing back came out of my adaptations). However, what I learned there was how to do certain specific things in certain specific situations. I did not learn the boundaries of when those specific techniques are appropriate, nor did I acquire an understanding of WHY we use those techniques.<p>It would be much more productive overall if I were to sit down with a good textbook on statistics and study it, cover to cover, as if I were back in school. That will overall improve me in this area far more than looking at open source projects (or closed source projects) that happen to do some statistical calculation.<p>I aspire to be more than a coder just coding up implementations of things where others have done the deep thought. I aspire to be like a Knuth or a Dan Bernstein, who can code well but who has a deep and broad understanding of the theory behind what he codes and why it is being coded that way.",1326142873

I don't think the amount of code is a particularly useful metric in most cases, but I would argue that the PHP+HTML solution is much clearer and easier to deploy, and taking into account everything you wish about such a simple web page (readability, maintainability, cross-server, security, etc.), takes less effort in the end.

It's very likely that the best of the best organs will remain for decades, if not centuries to come, but lesser examples of the art form will inevitably fall away as interest moves on to newer instruments and performance styles. As common as it is to lament the loss of music appreciation, music of all eras is seeing more authentic performance and attention now than perhaps ever, you just have to know where to look.

From a pragmatic perspective, B should be favored when either production constraints (capital investment, etc) or distribution costs are tangible at the margin. So durable goods and long-term services (e.g. insurance) should lean toward B.
A is favored if and only if iterative cycles can be accomplished without additional capital investment and distribution costs are near-zero. So, basically anything that could be delivered digitally that is not embedded in a durable good should be released when ""good enough"" (and then only improved if the iteration creates more value than the development of a new good or provision of a new service--iteration as rent-seeking is wealth-destructive).",1280095960

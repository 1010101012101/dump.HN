I love TextMate but it's a tool, and I'm happy to drop it if something better comes along (which might be TM2 or not, don't care).<p>But discussing/comparing features is a sensible topic. Saying that E-text beat Textmate to version 2 it useless. First, version number has nothing to do with features (as I was pointing out in the browser world). Second you can say E-text 2 is better than the latest Textmate, but nothing more: nobody apart from the author (and his collaborator) knows what's TM2 gonna be like.",1282553913

The people who make them are the programmers. These are the quirky geniuses who took an interest in computer science, math, and other inherently geeky fields from an early age. Their peers looked down on them for this, and as a result they tended to have uneventful social lives. But in their 20′s, they realized there was a killing to be made in online social networks, and so they went to work, armed with the technological know-how to make whatever application their more social peers desired. So what we have is the people with the ability to create, but no understanding of the market, and the people with the understanding of the market, but no ability to create.<p>While certainly a generalization, the point remains that those who developed an understanding of technological evolution (the computer) tend to have a poor perspective on those whose understanding is limited to biological evolution (humans), and vice versa.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://zachjiganti.com/2010/08/01/why-groupon-is-successful-how-to-approach-conceiving-web-ideas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zachjiganti.com/2010/08/01/why-groupon-is-successful-...</a>",1282553266

1626215,comment,1622086,1623491,0,0,snikolov,,,"I also think that aliens might well have completely different mathematics.  To me, the most compelling reason to think that is that the development of mathematics is rooted in our conscious perception of the world around us.  Our conscious perception is rooted in how our brains work, how our world looks, and how the stimuli from the world are connected to the brain.<p>Consider for example the theory of differential geometry.  Would we care about objects such as curves, surfaces, and manifolds if they (well, their low dimensional special cases) weren't ubiquitous in our world?<p>Would we care about permutations and symmetry if some people hadn't played around with arranging sets of objects?<p>Would we care about waves (sonic, fluid, E&M) if we didn't observe water flowing?<p>Even problems that seem to be mere puzzles with no basis in the ``real world'' are inextricably linked to the conscious perceptions that we learned to form by living in the world.<p>There was a great push to axiomatize all of mathematics beginning in the early 20th century and now it can be said that a lot of mathematics really is a collection of maps from assumptions to statements.<p>It could be that alien mathematicians have reached a collection of maps isomorphic to the one we have, but they ascribe completely different meanings to them.<p>Another possible scenario is that within the universe of all mathematics, our conscious perceptions and cognitive biases have carved out some subset, and alien mathematicians have carved out another.  These two subsets could be so vastly different that they are mutually unintelligible, and very difficult (maybe impossible) to translate between the two mathematical languages.  Even if we could translate the alien mathematics to a symbolic language familiar to us, and check that their theorems are correct, because of the vast difference in meanings ascribed to these two sets of mathematics, we just might not be able to understand what the alien mathematics <i>means</i>!",1282552311

1626213,comment,1625571,1625786,0,0,tjmc,,,"Yes, it's a bit of a tradition both here and in New Zealand to travel for a while. I remember when I was backpacking around Europe over 3 months in 1993 meeting a couple of Microsoft employees who explained that they only had 2 weeks to achieve the same goal.<p>They intended ""to visit McDonald's in every country"".<p>I think the key difference between Antipodeans and Americans regarding travel is a very specific meme. A lot of Americans have told me that taking a year off ""looks bad"" on your resume. That it indicates you don't take your career seriously or you're having some sort of personal crisis.<p>Here (and in NZ) travel is seen as broadening your horizons and it certainly doesn't count against you with employers. In fact, many see it as an accomplishment - part of a ""well rounded"" education.<p>So I'd invite HNer's to consider ""hacking"" this meme for themselves. I don't think it serves you very well.

We tend to be understanding of poor grammar here, but the instinctive reaction to flawed English is that the message is also flawed. While it is possible to work out what the author meant, it takes some consideration - that consideration is better spent on the ideas.<p>Writing should be like a window, that you can see clearly through - not one you have to keep checking to see if it's a mark on the window or what you're supposed to be seeing. Excellent writing disappears.<p>So, TalkBinary, if you're genuinely interested in writing, improving your English is crucial. It might seem prejudiced to criticize your English, but it is the first thing people see about your writing, and because their time is limited, they will judge it on that basis. swombat has given a lot of his time to you - although it can be harsh to hear negative comments, this is valuable advice you have received. It might also seem that grammar and spelling etc are secondary, and shouldn't matter (I used to feel this), but they really do - if you want to communicate. Hell, even when I read my own writing months later, any spelling errors etc are very distracting, and if I haven't been clear it is hard for even me, the author, to understand.<p>I'm not sure of the best way for you to improve, but the first thing is for you to <i>want</i> to. The second thing is to get feedback - swombat has given you a start (and I agree with all his writing points). If you can handle it, seek out further feedback and criticism. If you are in school/uni, you can probably find someone there to help also. The third thing is to take action on it - such as rewriting this article with the errors corrected.<p>Finally, I wanted to fill out one of swombat's points: writing out an algorithm can be crucial. I just spent the last two months getting one clear (I did have a go at coding it directly earlier on, but it wasn't clear enough). Once I was clear, it just took a day (today) to design, code and debug. Now, this <i>is</i> unusual; I'm doing research on relationships between grammars for a startup. Mostly it's not needed, as swombat says. But after two months, I just wanted to speak up for one of those problems that is not in the ""most"" category (though I'm inclined to think that <i>all</i> problems are trivially easy once you know how to solve them; similar to how mathematician can only do ""trivial"" proofs.)<p>I actually think the ideas quoted above are actually good ones, if you're not clear on what you're doing (though annoyingly expressed). Exploratory programming is also helpful. I find it's a mix; it depends how complex the problem is, how many different issues there are - and crucially - how much experience you have with that kind of program. Familiar problems are easy to solve in your head or at the keyboard. I used to always work that way, until I got into grammar stuff.<p>BTW: if you purely compiled this, so it's not your writing, remember that as editor, it's even more important that you are able to write well, so as to improve - <i>edit</i> - the writing of others. Anyway, good luck, I think the article is hepful overall, good on you for actually doing something and having a go, and I hope you start to take this opportunity, of room for improvement.",1282550883

1626176,comment,1625509,1625509,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"Video games. Seriously. Here's why:<p>1) <i>Hardware knowledge.</i> I didn't start programming until I started college, but I quickly realized that, growing up as a pretty avid gamer, I still had one advantage that a lot of the CS majors didn't have: I knew more <i>about computers</i> than they did. Games are some of the most demanding applications being created today, and, as a result, I had spent a lot of time reading hardware reviews and benchmarks. This resulted in my having a somewhat innate understanding of how  data is passed around inside a computer and how this affects performance. It takes time to understand on a deep level how your code is interacting with the hardware, but when you see the frame rate tank because you used an inefficient algorithm somewhere, it sticks with you instantly.[1]<p>2) <i>Instant gratification</i>. Much like web programming, game programming allows you to see the result of your work, immediately and incrementally. And it looks good, because you get to use professionally developed resources (models, textures, etc). A side benefit is having <i>good looking</i> programs to put in your portfolio.<p>3) <i>Wide variety of problem domains.</i> Once you get familiar with programming in general, you can then work on pretty much anything you want: 3D graphics, physics simulation, AI, networking, UI / UX , HCI, etc.<p>4) <i>It's fun.</i><p>Try giving Unity a shot and see how you like it:\n<a href=""http://unity3d.com/unity/download/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unity3d.com/unity/download/</a> . It's multiplatform and has API's in C#, JavaScript, and Python, so you have an element of choice. If you're a Windows user, I know a few people who started out by playing around with XNA, which uses C#.  Examples of free commercial game SDK's are Epic's Unreal Development Kit (<a href=""http://www.udk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.udk.com/</a>) and Valve's Source Engine SDK, which comes free with any Source Engine-based game.<p>[1] When working on a graphics project, I accidentally put the function that imports and initializes the texture resources into the draw loop, which meant that new memory was being allocated for them 60+ times per second. Needless to say, I became very aware of the problem when my fans started to spin up like jet engines.",1282550700

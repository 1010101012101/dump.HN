But management liked the flexible reporting and complicated workflows they could invent.<p>Personally I think Jira looks like it was written 10 years ago and can get quite slow at times, which together with the fact that there's no AJAX and every click reloads an entire page means it can be a very unpleasant experience.",1224791980

But if I had a normal employment situation, I'd be gradually money into stocks, towards a more normal asset allocation.<p>As for a retirement 20 years out - I wouldn't even try to predict that.

I don't agree.<p>Take Microformats, for instance. Say you're already displaying Events somewhere on a site; to add Microformat support all you do is add a few attributes to your existing mark-up and any Microformat-aware browser can properly recognize it. Sure, you could create another file entirely that contains XHTML specifically created as a Microformat, but that would be redundant and not nearly as helpful to visitors.<p>Or, say, a sitemap. Many times it makes sense to have a completely separate XML-based Sitemap for, say, Google. Then again, what if you just added the requisite semantic mark-up to an existing sitemap, one your visitors can use, but so can Google? You basically get two for the price of one.<p>RSS is a different animal and in most cases couldn't logically be encoded into the XHTML itself because you wouldn't have every RSS item on one page, etc. That's why the <link> tag is used to include it in the source, just like you include Javascript and CSS and so forth.",1224791413

As someone who has used an iPhone and now owns the G1 I can tell you that they are incredibly similar. A friend and I were comparing the two side by side. Most of the applications are comparable and in some cases we both had installed the same exact applications from the respective App Stores. I doubt most average people would know the difference if they were using Android in an iPhone case or the other way around. The two platforms have far more in common than you may think.<p>The Android SDK allows for some more possibilities than what is allowed on the iPhone, but this seems to be purely a business decision on the part of Apple. As far as features that appeal to consumers - branding and fads aside - I think it's pretty much a wash. The big difference is Apple's far superior marketing.",1224790798

341574,comment,341192,341294,0,0,DaniFong,,,"This style of programming interview is directly descendant from early microsoft. Some of the best minds in the business of making software engineering organizations cut their teeth on the topic (maybe microsoft isn't so stellar now, but how many organizations from that period are still making software that works at that scale?). Bill Gates pointed to the MS hiring strategy in particular as something that set them apart from their competitors.<p>However, there are lots of other fields that demand a certain level of competence for you to pursue them. Interviews at investment banks last all day, and they ask for pretty serious mathematics exams among other things. Lawyers must pass the BAR, which is fairly brutal. Actuaries must pass the actuarial exam. Musicians and dancers must audition. Aspiring professors must give a series of 'job talks', opening up their research and program to the criticisms of an entire faculty, after which they continue to meet one on one for hours at a time.<p>By contrast, the hours spent in Google interviews seem comparatively simple.",1224790133
341573,comment,341043,341412,0,0,jcl,,,"It depends on how you have the phone set up and how well you know it.  The obvious way:<p>- One tap to open the menu of applications<p>- One tap to open the camera application<p>- One press of the camera button<p>- One tap to choose to share the picture<p>- One tap to choose gMail (vs. messaging)<p>At this point you are in the To field, but you need to slide open the keyboard to type the address in.  So it is essentially the same ""number of interactions"" as the iPhone.  If you're a power user or curious, you might have figured out that you can also launch the camera application directly by pressing the camera button, which collapses the first two steps to one.<p>...Which highlights one of the strengths and weaknesses of the Android platform.  While the iPhone has just a few inputs (the screen and main button being the obvious ones), the G1 has many (screen, five main buttons, trackball, the keyboard, and the keyboard slide).  This gives the G1 more (and potentially faster) ways to do things, but it also means that the user may not always be able to guess which input is required to accomplish their goals.  The G1 apps are pretty good about telling the user when they need to do something out-of-the-ordinary -- the camera app, for example, points out the camera button on the casing -- but third-party applications may not be as careful, or they may neglect to handle all possible inputs in an Android-consistent manner.<p>I think it's a difference of philosophy, much like the difference between Apple's preference of a one-button mouse versus the preference of multiple-button mice on other platforms.  One button is easier for users to learn and developers to implement consistently, but more buttons let you do more stuff.",1224790090

Besides, Grandma can already have a website -- there are dozens of services out there like Typepad, Wordpress, Blogspot, etc. which allow Joe Public to have a website -- and he should be able to have a website, so long as whoever (or whatever) makes that site uses proper HTML, CSS, and Standards to create it.<p>Would it be great to get to a point where Standards are written for machines, I can write some super high-level markup that describes how I want a page laid out (or just draw it!) and nobody has to write another line of HTML or CSS, ever?

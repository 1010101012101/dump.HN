4737635,comment,4737033,4737033,13,0,mbell,,,"Specs like ""6A MOSFET"" don't exist in isolation.  The current rating of that MOSFET is due to the on resistance(Ron), the resistance between source and drain.  As current flows through the FET this resistance causes power to be dissipated as heat.  The 6A number comes from how much heat the junction can handle without frying and is measured under a set of assumptions.<p>Usually testing is done at room temperature (25C often used) with the best possible heat-sinking and ideal Vgs.  Most MOSFETs of this type actually tie the internal thermal components to the drain pins.  Its intended that the PCB designer use a large copper pour for the drain pads, this copper area acts as the heatsink for the chip, transferring heat away from the junction.<p>In other words, the MOSFET can only handle 6A if ambient temperatures are kept at room temp (usually means fans on it or its wide open to a room), there is adequate heat-sinking provided by the PCB design, and Vgs is high (higher Vgs reduces Ron).  Further its important to remember that FETs have a ""run away"" characteristic in that as junction temperature rises so does Ron, which creates more heat.<p>So, there is a lot more to the functional rating of a MOSFET than the 6A on the datasheet.  In reality you would never want to nor expect that FET to hold 6A.  With just a cursory look at the PCB layout and previous experience with what the ambient temperatures tend to be on back-planes of server chassis loaded with many drives, 1A would be pushing it, so I'm not at all surprised that these things blew.<p>Perhaps the most WTFery aspect of that PCB is the lack of any suitable capacitance near the SATA connectors.  If you aren't using staggered spin up and many drives were spinning up at the same time the rail voltages can dip which in this setup causes Vgs to drop, increasing Ron at the worst possible time as mechanical drives draw a lot more current at spin up.  This could trigger thermal run away.",1351971504

Since I didn't know the language at all, I spent a couple of years in ESL programs in primary school.<p>The way records are implemented is nice. It's essentially an extensible product type. However, since you already have product types, you may as well get sum types! These are fairly useful and have a natural symmetry with products.<p>The particularly interesting thing to look at is how sum types could have sub-typing. With records, sub-typing is very simple. If you have a record with fields a and b, it has accessor functions:<p><pre><code>   record -> a
   record -> b
</code></pre>
Now you can define a record with an additional field; let's call this record1. This type has <i>three</i> accessor functions:<p><pre><code>    record1 -> a
    record1 -> b
    record1 -> c
</code></pre>
Since the first two have to be the same as for record, you can use this wherever you could use a record. Since the memory layout is going to be consistent between the records (since you can only add fields to the end), this is also very natural to implement. (Now, <i>arrays</i> of records are a different story!)<p>We can now write that record1 <: record, or that record1 is a sub-type of record.<p>Sum types are, in a sense, the opposite of products. This is, in fact, a mathematical fact to do with duality[1][2].
More particularly, a sum type contains an element of <i>one</i> of the sum's types. So a sum of a and b contains <i>either</i> an a or a b. An important thing to note is that the alternatives are <i>tagged</i>. That is, if you have a sum of int and int, the two ints can be differentiated because the sum type keeps track of which one (left or right) it was constructed with. This corresponds to a disjoin union in math.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_%28category_theory%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_%28category_theory%29</a> <br />
[2]: <a href=""http://blog.ezyang.com/2012/10/duality-for-haskellers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ezyang.com/2012/10/duality-for-haskellers/</a><p>Where records have accessor functions, sum types have constructors. Let's imagine a sum containing a and b:<p><pre><code>    a -> sum
    b -> sum
</code></pre>
Essentially, we just took the record's functions and flipped them.<p>When we use a sum type, we have to match against the possible cases. So we need a case statement that has a branch for each possible type in the sum.<p>So what happens if we try to define sub-typing the same way as for products? We would get that sum1, which contains a, b and c, is a sub-type of sum. That is, sum1 <: sum. However, this doesn't work! A sum type contains a value of <i>one</i> of the types, and you don't know which one at runtime. So if you used a sum1 where you expected a sum, and the sum1 contained a value of type c, you wouldn't know what to do. In fact, we <i>also</i> need to flip the sub-typing relation. So instead of sum1 <: sum, we get sum <: sum1. That is, wherever you could use a sum of a, b and c, you can use a sum of just a and b.<p>Now this makes sense. Whenever you write a case statement for a sum of a, b and c, you have to have cases for a and b. So if you pass in a sum that could only have options a and b, you can obviously handle it.<p>So a sum type would fit naturally with the existing product types. But would it be useful? I believe it would. Now, I'm no expert in low-level programming. However, I believe there is a somewhat common idiom in C that looks something like this:<p><pre><code>    struct sum {
      int tag;
      union value {
        float a;
        int b'
      }
    }
</code></pre>
This is essentially a way to get a proper sum-type out of a union. A normal union is somewhat hard to work with; you usually want to know which type it currently contains. That's what the tag does. In essence, you've just implemented a real sum-type in C.<p>Now, this pattern isn't used <i>too</i> often, but I think it <i>is</i> useful. The main reason you don't see it much is that it's fairly complex and not immediately obvious--especially to somebody not familiar with sum types. However, if it was part of the language, I imagine it would see more use and make some code easier to write and less bug-prone.<p>Also, it seems the language does not have any way to replace C's union. So a sum type would be a natural and safer replacement, giving ESL more parity with C without sacrificing convenience.",1351970751

Learn to program a little before trying to jump in and do the Apache setup etc. Nothing is more frustrating than wanting to see your creation on-line but you just keep hitting your head against a brick wall because you can't deploy.

Hard drives would fail on these chassis very frequently, and when a fresh drive was swapped in, it would take many days to rebuild the RAID, if it ever rebuilt at all.<p>Putting the RAID set in a new machine, it would rebuild fine.   But in the original machine, we swapped out the raid controller, CPU's, even the whole motherboard, and the RAID sets still would not rebuild.<p>Long story short, each of these ""haunted"" servers had a bad fan that was causing a lot of vibration within the chassis - enough physical vibration happening that the hard drives were essentially rendered inoperable.<p>The moral of the story is to make sure you have good vibration dampening on your fans, and to use the sensors monitoring to alert you if the fans are going bad.  (Even this is not perfect, since sometimes the fan gets off-kilter but is still happily spinning at 10K RPM.   The first thing we did if we got an alert for a disk failure was to replace the fans and attempt a RAID rebuild before touching the ""bad"" disk)",1351969217

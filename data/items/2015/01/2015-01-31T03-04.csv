I&#x27;m already interested enough to watch some more, and this makes that sound more rewarding than I would have thought.<p>I didn&#x27;t like 2 that much actually. I feel like there wasn&#x27;t enough of a background explanation of the world that the episode was set in to really relate to the characters or their situation. Where did all of these people come from, why are they riding bikes all the time, and why are they living in this crazy merits-based world? Exactly who is building and maintaining all of this high-tech gear for them? What are the rules, who is enforcing them, and why? What is the point of making people ride bikes all day? Etc, etc etc.<p>I felt fascinated by the first episode, though. Yeah, the subject is crude, but I think it serves well to illustrate a number of trends of the modern world - just how much power there can be in mass media, and how impotent traditional authority structures can be against it when organized well. It&#x27;s striking that, absurd as the situation is, no individual part of it is really impossible even today.<p>Well, I will say that, while the individual pieces are not impossible, they would each take a lot of expertise in the appropriate field to set up. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible for all of that experience to exist in one person, or to find people with experience in the appropriate fields, bring them together, and get them all working towards a shared goal of something as absurd as getting the PM to fuck a pig, without the authorities finding out somehow.",1422676790

For example: Say you&#x27;ll work 40 hours a week, plus one weekend a month if there&#x27;s an emergency.

Step 2, grade the land and gravel it, never mind asphalt, no need. Step 3, good high security fence around. Step 4, Put up solar panels like these, but raised good and high, 20ft clearance under. Step 5, advertise &quot;Shaded RV Storage&quot;. Charge people a good rate for storing their RVs where they will not be so horribly sun-damaged, as many RVs are damaged by long-term sun exposure. Meanwhile selling power to the utility. And, bonus, put gutters along the lower edge of the tilted panels, leading to a buried cistern, collect rainwater water for pretty landscaping and for washing RVs (for a fee, your RV will be all sparkly clean when you come pick it up).<p>Yer welcome.<p>[1] Street view <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/2T8mZ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/maps/2T8mZ</a>",1422675863

8975780,comment,8973335,8974917,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"We had a wonderfully spirited debate about this inside of Google when I was there as Google was putting panels on their parking lots and the question of payback times came up.<p>Disclosure: I&#x27;ve had 5.2kW of solar panels on my roof since 2001.<p>You can do the &quot;simple&quot; computation, which is to take the cost of the installed system, add annual maintenance, use the expected generating capacity, multiply by the kWh charge, and then point at the place they cross zero.<p>The first problem you have with that is the price per kWh is not constant, it is higher during the day (peak) and lower at night, you can choose to use the peak power rate as panels in California generate their rated power during the period the power company considers &quot;peak&quot; time.<p>The second thing is that panels in the Bay Area generate rated power from about 10AM to 2PM, and depending on conditions some amount before and after that. My panels &quot;come on&quot; when the sun comes up and depending on fog hit their rated power between 9AM and 10AM in the summer, closer to 10AM in the winter (Sun is lower on the horizon).<p>When we installed the calculation was 5 solar &quot;hours&quot; (peak production) * net capacity (about 4.8kW) to get 24kWH per day of generation (nominal) which matched our nominal daily power usage. In the fall our panels do 18 - 20 per day, in the spring 28 - 32 per day. At $0.20/kWH about $1750 in power per year and about 11 years for the costs to meet at 0 (they were $19,000 installed after rebates and what not).<p>So that is the &quot;simple&quot; version. Other things we might have considered (but didn&#x27;t actually)<p>Had we invested the $19,000 in 2001 in the S&P 500 would we have doubled our money by 2012? Answer nope. Although we&#x27;re getting close these days.<p>How much &quot;more&quot; is the resale value of our home with $20,000 of panels on it? $20,000? $0? Hard to tell in the Bay Area because prices are just crazy anyway. We have had a couple of solar equipped houses in the area sell and the realtor that lives across the street seems to thing there is a premium but can&#x27;t really say if its washed out by changing opinions on the public schools.<p>Cost of Maintenance? Our panels are &quot;grid tied&quot; which means they push power into the grid when the home is using less than they are producing. Other wise they contribute what they can to the existing house load. So maintenance consists of going up on the roof and hosing them down every 4 - 6 months to removes dust, and trimming a tree in our front yard which would shade them if it got any taller.<p>AC Costs? We don&#x27;t have an air conditioner (we insulated the crap out of the house to maximum thermal efficiency) but the panels do cut down significantly on the heat load in the attic. Prior to their installation we had an attic fan that would being cycling the air if it got about 100F in the attic and it would run probably every other day in the summer but runs perhaps 6 to 12 times per summer these days. Not a &quot;cost&quot; but the house is more comfortable.<p>Carbon Footprint? No even though we&#x27;ve been less responsible (via fossil fuel electricity) for generating CO2 it isn&#x27;t easy to compute the cost of that and figure out how it contributes to the break even point.<p>The warranty on the panels is 25 years (although I&#x27;ve mentioned elsewhere that we had to swap one with a Chinese panel as Sharp cannot replace like for like and that would impact the entire system). The inverter warranty was 10 years, they are going strong. So do we run it for another 10 years and then use the money to buy replacement panels? Maybe. I&#x27;ve been considering redoing them now (current generation panels are quite a bit more efficient than the ones I have, so moving most of my current system to a ground mount and replacing the roof panels I could probably get close to the PG&E cut off of 10kW)<p>Given the lower cost of current panels (especially pre-tariff!) I expect that if they are grid tied they pay back their investment in under 15 years here in the Bay Area. But until I price the replacement system I won&#x27;t have solid numbers for that.",1422675819

One of the problems with the text-in-a-texture method that I&#x27;ve done here is that there is no relief of depth to the text, and relief is actually an important part of how we make sense out of objects in 3D space. It&#x27;s fine on a 2D screen because the context is so restricted that it all stays consistent. But in 3D, it&#x27;s kind of disconcerting to see completely flat textures.<p>Like, why do we still use plain text in flat files for source code (for the most part, there are a few exceptions-that-prove-the-rule)? Why are there so many examples of graphical programming systems that have completely failed? Is it because there is something inherent to text that makes it superior for representing algorithms? Or is it because 1-dimensional text maps to our IO systems the best?

In the real world someone can rely on their appearance to telegraph a lot of things--clothing and grooming choices alone can hint at sexuality, politics, social class, and a variety of other things, to say nothing of existing social structures and bonds (who you surround yourself with also telegraphs a lot).  On the internet, you either need to explicitly say these things (&quot;I&#x27;m not straight&quot;, or &quot;I came from a well off family&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m a conservative&quot;) or signal them somehow, and there are areas where it&#x27;s less acceptable to overtly announce your membership in a group, so implying it through general biwords for it is socially necessary.  (&quot;I&#x27;m filthy rich&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m really, really smart and intellectual&quot; or even &quot;I&#x27;m really, really, really ridiculously good looking&quot; all likely fall under that category.  I think that generally the more desirable the category, the more it requires either actually costly signals--e.x. displaying expensive artwork in your home or donating lots of money in the case of wealth--to do &#x27;acceptably&#x27;.)<p>You see some of it on HN, too, although I think it&#x27;s generally much less accepted to negatively signal here--but especially in the more social-justice-y threads, you see a lot of signalling of people picking sides going in both directions, because that&#x27;s something that HN doesn&#x27;t really have any sort of unity on but individuals here feel strongly about.  In this thread there was a perhaps unsurprising backlash against the author (usually backed up with some logic--which is thankfully required by the etiquette here) about why the posters were justified in their active dislike of sports.<p>In my experience most social signaling/biwording is fairly well summed up by the basic theory of &quot;You will only expend effort signaling if there&#x27;s (a) a chance you&#x27;ll be mistaken for someone in a group you don&#x27;t want to be mistaken as, and (b) there&#x27;s a chance you&#x27;ll be seen as being in the group you want to be in because of it.&quot;",1422673714

If I pick dimensions for the editor that fit the window&#x27;s aspect ratio, and don&#x27;t rotate the view at all, then the editor pane can fill the browser window and it looks very natural.<p>I am not positive, as I don&#x27;t have the spec laying in front of me and it&#x27;s been a long time since I looked, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the HTML5 Canvas API is not hardware accelerated at this time. That is how I do the actual rendering of the text, using Text API.<p>There is another project called fontpath[1] that can read TTF and OTF font files, and another project from the same developer called gl-sprite-text[2] that can render them as bitmaps to textures. I&#x27;ve been considering converting my rendering over to using it. The process would at least be good practice in decoupling the code a bit more, as I think the tokenizer and keyboard system would be useful in other projects as well.<p>The keyboard code pages aren&#x27;t yet complete for everyone in the world right now, but I think they go a long way towards making it possible to once and for all make good keyboard interactions in JS. And by completely implementing my own end-around of the browser&#x27;s own handling, sticking to more of the older primitives, I am actually able to make for more cross browser compatible. I don&#x27;t know if anyone noticed, but this runs in IE perfectly fine, and I didn&#x27;t really do anything special to make it so. And if you just run the Canvas on its own, without the WebGL part, it actually runs on some relatively old browsers without any trouble.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/mattdesl/fontpath"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mattdesl/fontpath</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/mattdesl/gl-sprite-text"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mattdesl/gl-sprite-text</a>",1422673601

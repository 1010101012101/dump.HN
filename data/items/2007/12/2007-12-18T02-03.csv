90565,comment,90387,90555,0,0,akkartik,,,"> You don't really understand something until you implement it.<p>Yup. We've already established that one has to prioritize what to implement. The priority clearly shouldn't always go towards doing something rather than reading what somebody else did. (Children would never learn to write that way.) Instead we prioritize differently at different times, and we try to have lots of feedback between reading and doing, by things like active reading.",1197946764

I just got ""Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"" by Bishop, and it's a great book.",1197946437

All I'm saying is: don't exclude reading about past failures when you make your choices on what to do next. It's fine to say ok, let's stop reading for a while and try building this one thing my mind has settled on. That's a great habit to acquire.<p>The unpronounceable author of Flow:

says the most successful people alternate periods in closed states when they focus on a specific concrete project with periods in open states where they demonstrate huge appetite for new ideas.<p>I'm starting to think we're saying the same thing in different words and with slightly different emphasis.

In such a case, you are investigating based on your own intimations and your efforts will develop from there, rather than from from a top-down view -- which has so far been amply demonstrated <i>not</i> to work.<p>Edit: The recommendation to look ""everywhere"" is untenable, because at some point you have to stop casting about if you are going to get anything done yourself.",1197944696

90544,comment,90387,90481,0,0,akkartik,,,"Yes, learning by doing is good. But learning by doing involves feedback loops between reading about what others did and trying to do your own. Artists must both learn to appreciate art and keep practicing their own <i>craft</i>.<p>I'm not saying that you have to learn <i>everything</i> before doing <i>anything</i>. That's a strawman. I'm saying you shouldn't ignore any source of knowledge, that you should look everywhere taking the good and leaving out the bad.

Also in basic typewriter tuition, your right hand apposing finger starts on the keyboard at the letter ""j"" when you commence typing. ""k"" has your right index finger.

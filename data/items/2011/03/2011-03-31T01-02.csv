2390063,comment,2386874,2388532,1,0,vecter,,,"The main point that you're missing is that there is a huge demand for liquidity during a majority of market hours. On average, 7 billion shares of US equities are traded every day. That is a monumentally large number if you think about it. According to the TABB consulting group, roughly 50-70% of American stock trades are done by HFT [1]. Let's assume that 10-20% of trading is non-profit motivated (utilitarian, you could say). That means that roughly 1 billion shares are exchanged every day by utilitarian traders. That in itself should be clear evidence that there is a large demand for liquidity.<p>HFT market makers play an important role in those transactions. Specifically, they make it cheaper to buy and sell stocks by (1) tightening the bid-ask spread and (2) providing more quantity at each price, so that the average cost of executing an order is less. Not only that, when markets become tighter, they actually enable transactions to occur that would not have happened before. In other words, previously where buyers and sellers would NOT have traded because the transaction costs of crossing the bid-ask spread were too high, those two parties can now trade. Specifically, without HFT, there would be far fewer than 1 billion shares traded by utilitarian traders on a daily basis.<p>To address the other point of providing liquidity ""when the markets need it most"", let's take a step back. When you say that ""market makers should step in to provide liquidity [for society's benefit]"", you're implying that there's some externality to lack of liquidity in financial markets (if so, this is yet another reason that we need HFT on a daily basis). Suppose that this is the case: there is some negative externality to society when markets are illiquid, as is oft to happen when things go crazy in the world. During those times, volatility is insanely high because the risk of being in any position is also insanely high. Remember, market makers get compensated (on average) for holding risk that you don't want. If risk is higher, naturally, the compensation should be also. This is manifested in higher costs of execution: spreads widen and the available quantity at each level decreases.<p>If you want to force HFT market makers, which are private corporations, to step in to provide more liquidity, then you are forcing these companies to pay for that externality. In effect, they would take on huge risk for far diminished expected returns. That doesn't make any particular sense to me. However, if society as a whole has this view that some private corporations need to pay for public externalities, then that should be a matter of regulation. But if that's the case, why pick on HFT in particular? Why not force McDonalds and Whole Foods to give food to hungry people during famines? Surely, there is an externality to the food industry NOT stepping in during periods of extended hunger, ""just when people need it the most.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://georgewashington2.blogspot.com/2010/10/yes-70-of-us-equity-trades-are-high.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://georgewashington2.blogspot.com/2010/10/yes-70-of-us-e...</a>",1301535867

But not in the way I suspected. Any link level device that uses a single (simplex) medium (wifi, fixed wireless, mobile wireless, cable modems, DSL modems, etc. as opposed to Ethernet, which is generally duplex) only has so much bandwidth available.<p>At the WISP I worked for, we used to use Canopy 900mhz radios to provide fixed wireless service as well as backhaul for our city-wide mesh network. Since these radios only had ~3.3mbps aggregate bandwidth, we had to decide how to allocate it. In our case, we chose something like 5:1 download to upload ratio. This was a conscious choice about how best to use the available spectrum/bandwidth. I <i>believe</i> the same is true for cable/DSL media. Please feel free to correct me.",1301535481

While sport isn't a modern invention, the particular sports (and the fierceness of pursuit due to the money, fame, etc.) are new.<p>And finally, I'm not sure if my comment further proves your point, or if it means that we can only compare literature to sport in comparable times.

It exposes all your pages and data in an XML API. We have ""tree"" templates and ""sprint"" templates. A sprint page is added as the child of a tree page. You can timesheet against a tree, if you're doing some unplanned maintenance or something that just crops up, or you timesheet against a sprint if this is actually what you're supposed to be working on (this allows us, theoretically, to tell when a sprint is late because someone has been pulled in too many other directions, but in practice we don't have tools to report on this yet).<p>So the IRC bot reads from the task system so that you can just type like:<p>askl: start decal<p>in order to start working on decal if you're doing some unplanned support or maintenance work, or if you're helping someone else out with <i>their</i> work, basically this is seen as an interruption from what you're scheduled to do.<p>Otherwise you can do this:<p>askl start: decal: some release<p>to timesheet against a sprint (we block off time in google calendar to allocate work). Each ""sprint page"" has a structured xml component on it (this is like, Decal terminology that won't make sense until you try it - we should have a live demo ready in a few weeks so you can give us your email address by going here if you want to be told when that happens: <a href=""http://www.decalcms.com/page/Try_it_Out"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.decalcms.com/page/Try_it_Out</a>).<p>This structured XML component is where we put the client name, dates for the sprint and costs basis (either fixed price or amount per hour). This information is then used to make entries in the timesheeting system so we can tell whether to mark time as billable (in the case of per hour) so that it will generate an invoice, or not in the case of a fixed price where I raise an invoice separately and then the profit made on that ""sale"" is offset by the ""loss"" made in the development hours.<p>All of this is very ad-hoc, strung together with duct tape and pixie dust and most of it works most of the time. The most important thing is that all our hours and work are logged, and that's how we work out leave entitlements at the end of the year.<p>ie. each person is expected to put in 6 billable hours per day for 219 work days per year. So at the end of the year we just sum the hours you worked, and whatever is left over is how much leave you get the following year.<p>Right. yeah.

Now, what would cocaine at that price level do to a population, families and to society?""<p>It seems to me the most reasonable approach to legalization is to deliberately set up a negative feedback loop by taxing the drug and funding harm reduction programs (prevention/treatment) directly from the tax proceeds.  As long as the price is set within a range that is low enough to prevent black market distribution from being so profitable that criminals are willing to take on the associated risks, the government would effectively be able to set the equilibrium via the tax rate.  Eliminating the black market would go a long way towards eliminating the violent crime associated with the drug trade.",1301533252

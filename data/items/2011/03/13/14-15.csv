Felix Dennis's ""How to Get Rich"" is one of the best business books I've ever read, I <i>highly</i> recommend it.<p>Sometimes the startup world devises its own theories on what makes businesses successful, and it's good to balance that out with the views of an old school no-nonsense, and massively successful, old media founder like Felix Dennis. He lays it out straight for you and he's all entrepreneur.

2319291,comment,2318939,2318939,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"> We also put out a chainsaw, because you don’t want to go through a 2x4 with a hand tool.<p>I don't think buying a chainsaw is practical, buy a proper carpenters saw (AKA cross-cut saw) and you'll be able to get through a 2x4 in less time than it takes to even start a chainsaw. It's easy to maintain (about once a month a spray down with WD40 will keep it from rusting, which rust will only become a pain in the ass if you've left it in direct contact with water or after about a decade hung up in your average garage). A 24"" (full-draw, why full-draw? Because you'll have to work 3 times as hard with a 15"" half-draw as you're spending 1/2 your cut moving slowly and keeping alignment) carpenters saw will run you around $30 for a top-notch brand.<p>If you're going to buy a chainsaw don't. You can get a battery operated sawzall (reciprocating saw) for a similar or lesser price. It would likely be cheaper and safer to buy a miniature generator and a sawzall. The sawzall also has the nice ability to be used for precision and with a metal-cut blade can be used for other things (IE cut open a jammed lock). You can get a hackzall (one handed reciprocating saw) for around $130 MSRP and sawzalls for around $200 MSRP both often include two batteries and a charger.<p>If you're going to have a generator, you can go as low as $70 for a 9A sawzall.<p>Chainsaws are dangerous for even trained users. Sawzalls are hardly dangerous when operated by idiots. A fullsize sawzall can be operated with one hand. A hackzall is easily operated with one hand (I'm talking an electric knife level of easy).<p>Carpenters saws are the safest you can get. Aren't effected by power and last a solid decade in a good location with zero maintenance. WD40 it once a month and it'll last your lifetime if you're keeping it solely for emergency use.",1300028020

2319278,comment,2318980,2319214,0,0,illumin8,,,"The PhD from MIT failed to mention in his article, when he talks about the 3rd containment being concrete poured around the steel casing, that the reactor which caused an explosion was built prior to this 3rd containment layer being mandatory in BWR design.  So, it would seem that his confidence in the 3rd containment layer preventing any melted radioactive materials from getting out should be taken with a huge grain of salt.<p>Updating with more information:  Please see this list of BWR reactors throughout the world:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_boiling_water_reactors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_boiling_water_reactors</a><p>You will notice that Fukushima Daiichi No. 1 (which caused the hydrogen explosion to the building walls) is a BWR/3, MK-1 model reactor.  From this page, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BWR#Evolution_of_the_BWR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BWR#Evolution_of_the_BWR</a>, you will see the following:<p>The first [General Electric] series of production BWRs evolved through 6 iterative design phases, each termed BWR/1 through BWR/6. (BWR/4s, BWR/5s, and BWR/6s are the most common types in service today.) The vast majority of BWRs in service throughout the world belong to one of these design phases.<p>1st generation BWR : BWR/1 with Mark-1 containment.<p>2nd generation BWRs : BWR/2, BWR/3 and some BWR/4 with Mark-I containment. Other BWR/4, and BWR/5 with Mark-II containment.<p>3rd generation BWRs : BWR/6 with Mark-III containment.<p>So, it would seem to me, that this confirms, it was not until at least BWR/4 or above that Mark-II containment was used.  I'm pretty sure this confirms there is no 3rd containment layer.",1300027654

2319269,comment,2318305,2318305,0,0,katzgrau,,,"I think this'll be a big deal.<p>While I do have to agree with pak about the ugliness (and annoying semantics) of $this->load->thing(), it was something the CI team had to keep around since the framework was already very successful in the wild, and the devs had their backs against the wall to support PHP 4. The Kohana team (or any newer framework) had the benefit of initially not needing to appease anybody when they wanted to build something for pure PHP 5.<p>Kohana had great beginnings, and I used it to develop a major website owned by NBC. The most annoying part of using it? The documentation was sorely lacking, and class names were inconsistent at best. At least docs are something that can change for the better quickly, but broken docs are something that have persisted through 2.x and 3.x.<p>Beauty is not something CodeIgniter has going for it. In fact, if you agree with that, you're likely to agree that PHP in general in an ugly language. But CodeIgniter has gained it's loyalty and reputation because of:<p>1. Speed - It's always at the top of PHP framework benchmarks, and use of minimal resources is ingrained in it's design philosophy<p>2. Documentation - It has the best documentation of any framework that I've seen or used<p>3. Principle of Least Astonishment - There is little magic in CodeIgniter, and things in CI only happen because you told CI to do it. Like $this->load->view(). It means more typing, but it's logical, and explicitly stated.<p>CodeIgniter has a big user-base, and it's weathered time, which is more than other frameworks for the language can say. Now, users are begging the Reactor team to add libraries and helpers to the framework as features. The Reactor team's goal is to keep CI light and fast — the idea is to pack a lot of power in a small footprint.<p>That's where Sparks comes in. It's not just about easily installable libs (@pan69), it's about keeping the core framework ultra-light and doing what a framework should be doing.<p>I think sparks is going to help CodeIgniter cement its place as a staple PHP framework, which really doesn't exist for the language. Newer frameworks with snazzier syntax and cool features will always pop up, but the Reactor team plans to make it /the/ primary framework to use for PHP.",1300027306

2319263,comment,2318980,2319246,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"There is a reason I feel much relieved after reading this. Pretty much everything I've read so far implied that once there is a meltdown, all bets are off. We'll have radioactive material boiling in open air, and all the ""good"" things that come with it.  Which sounded very suspicious to me... I mean, isn't containment designed to prevent exactly that? Once the fuel melts, it just makes a hole on the bottom of the containment and pools on the floor? So for me, the money shot was here:<p>> For that purpose, a large and thick concrete basin is cast under the pressure vessel (the second containment), which is filled with graphite, all inside the third containment. This is the so-called “core catcher”. If the core melts and the pressure vessel bursts (and eventually melts), it will catch the molten fuel and everything else. It is built in such a way that the nuclear fuel will be spread out, so it can cool down.<p>edit: Plus reading about INES, there was a British plant that had 5 (five) level 4 incidents in 25 years, and a partial core meltdown at a French plant.

From this presentation, it looks like Steve Blank has chosen to go the heretic route.  Wide distribution first, worry about monetization later?  Engineering a financial transaction from the beginning?  I'm a long way from Chicago, but I can <i>still</i> hear Jason Fried's head exploding.<p>Personally, I suspect Steve is right, but only over the very short term.  We've got a nascent tech bubble (and a commodities bubble, and a booming stock market) because our central bank's glued to a zero-interest-rate policy, and is further stimulating the economy through quantitative easing - pumping about $3B a day into the economy through bond purchases.  All that cash has to go somewhere, and it is - anywhere it can get higher yields than the bond market.<p>This economic stimulation is all being done to keep the economy healthy in the face of unprecedented federal deficits - but it's a house of cards, and it'll explode as soon as foreign investors want higher rates for the privilege of holding American bonds.  When this happens, the tech bubble goes away, and any company pursuing a bubble strategy is hosed.  At that time, having a bootstrapped startup generating decent cashflow will look pretty good - not as good as selling during a bubble, but a hell of a lot better than <i>not</i> selling after a bubble.<p>That's why I'm curious about the timeframe in Steve's slides.  Why does he think the bubble period ends in 2014?  Three years is a pretty short timeframe for generating massive hype, getting huge, and flipping a company - is this advice even actionable?",1300025549

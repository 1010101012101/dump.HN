Its a website written in HTML5 and JavaScript (using jQuery) that takes the concept of a traditional Operating System to the cloud.<p>We have created a web desktop for everyone to use as their computer. They can edit documents, watch movies, play games using our apps or any other app available in weeZeel Store, where anyone can sell an app developed using our API, with the feature of being 100% social. All these apps have the ability to work on real time thanks to websockets.<p>And because weeZeel is social, you can share all the files and folders you want with your contacts with one single click and you can interact with them in any app.<p>If you want to try our demo (still work to be done) just use this url: http://www.weezeel.com/demo.php",1353113994

There might have been peace talks but it seems like they had stock of missiles they wanted to ship out before any peace was signed for. The bottom line is that both sides of this conflict are held hostage to a very vocal and armed minorities of both sides who would like to keep the conflict burning on. Its no wonder that these things happen just before elections. Both sides have an interest to keep a right wing government in place and the best way to do this is by firing missiles and retaliating against them. Fear drives people to elect a right wing government and nothing drives fear like a bunch of missiles and a heavy ""disproportionate"" response. 
Until both sides wake up and realize they are controlled by tiny minorities with guns there is no hope to resolve this conflict.",1353113800

4796640,comment,4795542,4796534,0,0,scott_s,,,"There's some subtlety going on here, but I'm going to agree with CJefferson.<p>Turing completeness is about separating the <i>expression</i> of a computation from the <i>machinery</i> that carries out the computation. If your expression language can be mapped to the idealized Turing machine, then your expression language can express all computations that can be computed. (That is, it is Turing Complete.) This allows us to reason about the expression of computation outside of the machinery that carries it out - because the machinery will always have limits.<p>The subtlety is: where do we draw the line between the expression and the machinery?<p>That is, assuming the question is ""is the C preprocessor Turing Complete?"" I answer no. Because implied in that question is that the C preprocessor language is the expression language we are interested in, and the C preprocessor is the machinery. The reason why I say that the C preprocessor expression language is not Turing complete is simple: you cannot actually express recursion or unbounded loops. No, the above is not a counter example. Why? Because the simulated loops are bounded, always. If you can't <i>express</i> arbitrary loops or recursion, then you can't compute everything that can be computed.<p>Note that I stressed <i>express</i>. Yes, an actual C program is clearly limited in how much it can recurse, but the language itself can <i>express</i> unbounded recursion.<p>And that can make our reasoning a bit more interesting: what if rather than asking the question about the C preprocessor, we instead ask it about the implied functional language that the author defined? This implied functional language is implemented in the macros the author defined. If we assume that his implied functional language is the expression language, and the machinery is both the C preprocessor language <i>and</i> the by-hand macros that CJefferson pointed out, then yes, that implied functional language is turing complete. That is, we could take the semantics behind his top-level macros, and go implement a fully Turing Complete language with those semantics. That's what you are getting at when you consider those macros the same as physical memory. We can do that, but now we're reasoning about the author's implied functional language, not the C preprocessor itself.<p>If you still don't agree, consider that the author's macro language is essentially the same as BlooP: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlooP_and_FlooP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlooP_and_FlooP</a>",1353113100

Large javascript application used to bw written without any frameworks but I'm not bringing them up as examples. What would be interesting to see would be the same examples written across frameworks in terms of code written, code organization, maintainability and size.<p>The main issue as I see it is that people choose a framework for a project in a short period of time and larger frameworks tend to take time before you see where they shine. I hear people's reason for going with Backbone because it was really the first major MVC out there and because of it's popularity. When I hear why people go with another framework it's because of features - not popularity.<p>Add on to this whenever I've talked to people or read blogs on systems made with other frameworks the majority of talks on backbone are how to solve problems they encountered while talks about larger frameworks are how to use new features and get more from your code. Maybe it's just because Backbone has been around longer that we've all had more time to find the hardships, I don't know but time will tell.<p>Is it FUD to say all this? Probably a little, but if we don't have any fear, uncertainty or doubt when taking on a new project then you probably haven't got any idea what you're getting yourself in to.",1353112662

It is used to sell more Prime subscriptions (and more Kindles as well).  It seems that now Amazon is testing if it could be a viable standalone business but its not guaranteed.<p>It seems like SVOD services are generally support businesses that aim to promote a companys main product/service that is sold at a higher margin. For instance, DISH Network offers access to Blockbuster SVOD platform as an add-on to its pay-TV subscription (the idea here is to get more pay-TV subscribers). Comcast XFINITY SVOD service is provided on top of other Comcast services and aims to attract more pay-TV and broadband subscribers. We could even argue that Netflix Instant Streaming was first used to support Netflix DVD by Mail business (even if it might not be completely the case here).<p>The margins on those SVOD services are low compare to the pay-TV or DVD by Mail business. In Q3 2012, Netflix contribution margin for its domestic streaming business was 16.4% vs 48% for its domestic DVD by Mail business. As pointed out earlier, for SVOD to work, you need volume. Thus, Netflix strong push for its international expansion. Amazon might pull it off, but it will require significant investment outside the US to work out.",1353111108

No one in this thread is talking about legal alternatives, because they don't exist. The illegal alternatives are a an insanely better experience, and people are paying for them to boot.<p>There is a huge opportunity for someone to come in and create the Spotify of video, but it probably won't happen soon because it will be near impossible to work with content providers to create it. Plus there's not a huge incentive, since even Spotify is being sucked dry with licensing fees.<p>Let's face it: the current state of the industry is not capable of providing a high quality user experience to the consumer (I'm almost 100% convinced). They're all about forcing the consumer to use whatever creates the most money, and if you amass enough power, sure, you can do that. Effectively, they are exercising their legal rights to hold back the quality of the end-user experience. Is it right? It is a moral grey area. They have the right to protect their content and the creators of that content, to ensure they are compensated fairly. But at the same time, it is holding back progress.<p>In short: if you want the best personal digital entertainment experience, a legal alternative <i>at any cost</i> is not available. There are simply too many providers and too many limitations and services. Furthermore, the quality of illegal methods (which will not be named; the secret ones are indeed the best) are extremely high as to be almost the best possible outcome.<p>It is a very complicated situation.

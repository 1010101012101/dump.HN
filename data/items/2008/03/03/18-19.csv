128220,comment,128110,128110,0,0,adnam,,,"I went to a conference recently about AIR and it looks quite interesting.  Adobe understands that there is a divide between programmers who make web-based software and programmers who make desktop software and their idea is to bring web-programming techniques to the desktop. For example, you could download an AIR program that gives you a more fluid and responsive front-end to Amazon.com which pre-caches the parts of the catalogue most interesting to you. Could be interesting once the runtime is more widely installed.",1204570589

128208,comment,127278,127278,0,0,phaedrus,,,"The trouble with the C++ paradigm that the implementor of a class does a bit more work so that the user of a class doesn't have to is that it's recursively extra work:  I do extra work in a low-level class so it's user can do less - but wait!  I'm the user of this class.  And in the class in which I use the class I just worked hard on, I further have to do extra work for the benefit of the users of the second class.  And so on - a hall of mirrors of extra work.  Not to say that it's zero-sum, but the effect is more one of shifting the work downward in the hierarchy and I only get a net benefit if I reuse the most basic classes roughly at least 3 times.  Not all classes are created for re-use; some are created just to divide up the code into smaller human-readable chunks, and that's where the extra work for the implementor of a class is more overhead than it saves.",1204569187

Each of these four sources of capital has slightly different implications for entrepreneurs.<p>Fundraising Cycles\nInvestments made in a VC fund by a diverse group of limited partners are integrated in closed end funds. As a result, VCs who raise money from a diverse group of LPs have to go and raise capital from limited partners every 3-5 years. Money is raised, the fund is closed, the capital is invested and then another fund is raised.<p>As a result, entrepreneurs can be affected by where the current fund is in its lifecycle. If you receive an investment from a VC when they are raising another fund, the VC will likely be slightly busier than they would otherwise be. Fundraising is a very time consuming process for VCs, making them very busy. This doesn’t mean that they won’t have time for you, it just means that their schedules will be more complex and they will be slightly harder to reach.<p>However...",1204568064

128195,comment,128118,128166,0,0,jcl,,,"It's also useful knowledge for spammers.  If they have a list of people who are interested in topic X, then they can craft an e-mail with a subject and body that is relevant enough to topic X that the people will be likely to click on a link in the message.  The reason that spammers do not already do this is because it is too much trouble to track the topics associated with e-mail addresses and because the number of e-mail addresses easily found for a topic is too small to justify the expense of writing a custom e-mail.  With your proposed service, it sounds like it would be easy to both track topic associations and retrieve large numbers of addresses.<p>Really, it sounds like you're trying to solve two different problems: (1) given an e-mail address, find relevant topics and (2) given a topic, find relevant e-mail addresses.  A solution to either of these problems has the potential to enable spammers, if it is standardized to the point where address/topic extraction can be automated.  In this regard, it's hard to beat the current system of listing your interests on your web page (which at least solves problem 1).",1204567857

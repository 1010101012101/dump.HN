What you will perceive as unbiased depends on your own political leanings.<p>For example, I consider anything left of Ayn Rand level capitalism advocacy a left-leaning bias because it's left of the truth. But other people would say that's extremely biased even though it consists of nothing but true statements. What they would call unbiased would be advocacy of some mixed/compromise economic system which is left of capitalism. Shrug.",1278910704

1506860,comment,1506453,1506683,0,0,Crossfire,,,"I agree, the voice speed is too slow, and it sends the data back to google for analysis each time, rather than doing it on the phone, which means if you are anywhere with less than stellar reception, or if you have limited data, it can become instantly useless.  If you could download the maps for you local area, and do vocal direction searches on it, or search your phone without having to be connected to the internet, I could see myself using it a lot more.  As it is, I have found that as useful as voice recognition might be, in reality it is far out-shadowed in usefulness by google gestures, which is quite simply the greatest phone app I have yet discovered. I have gestures set as one of my four taskbar apps in Cyanogen, and in the quickbar, this means that from anywhere In the phone i am only ever two touches away from it.<p>What google gestures does, for those who have not tried it, is to index everything in your phone, contacts, apps, songs, games, the lot. it then allows you to search through it all by drawing a full screen letter.  If a single letter does not narrow the search down enough, wait a second and enter in a second letter.  I have never had to enter more than three letters to have the correct item appear, backspace is back swipe, clear is forward swipe. All processing is done on the phone, results are instantaneous and every result gives the option to play, view, edit, send message, call, locate or delete right from the same window. It is genius.<p>I never seem to see it mentioned in android reviews, but for me this is androids killer app. Combined with swype or shapewriter it totally changed the way i interacted with my phone. Voice recognition may never reach %100, and it may require generalist AI before it does, but contextual gesture recognition is here now and it works fantastically. While iphone has some apps that perform similar task, they are all for a specific purpose, like swype but just for sending texts. Whereas android allows you to set swype as a system wide input default.<p>Ubiquitous seamless context sensitivity is just so beautiful, it is hard to imagine it not becoming a yardstick against which things are measured. Instead of asking if can email or skype, we may well be asking if it can detect when I'm at the movies and turn itself on silent, or adjust its brightness to match the setting, or make the heater turn on when im getting home. So much of what we use our phones for is predictable, as the sample set of your daily routine grows, your devices should be able to learn and adapt, just as its dictionary builds a lexicon of your used words, so it should build of memory of your default actions and be ready to activate proactively rather than reactively. Why should I have to hunt for the TV remote app,  it knows that i am infront of the TV, and that the TV app is what I usually use when I am there, with a bit of context sensitivity the whole debate around ease of use could rightly shift from the sleek ui, to the sleek life integration, which is really where google shines.<p>Oh and in regards to your issue of going back and editing, I had the same issue, until I finally discovered what that seemingly superfluous trackball was for, precise letter by letter control.",1278910512

But in my experience, it's often been the people with the least vested interest who have the strongest opinions, and rather than 'calling bikeshed' the smart thing to do would be to identify the real stakeholders and get their opinions.<p>If you have hundreds of servers, the team of sys admins using them every single day, who stand a good chance of connecting to all of them at least once in a year, should take priority over a manager who might refer to a small portion of them in conversation at a high level a few times per month or year.<p>Someone who has to use server names in conversations with customers, investors, partners, and the like should take priority over a guy who wants to name production servers after his favorite porn stars.<p>One solution is to simply declare bikeshed and pick an arbitrary scheme.

When news happens, they often write posts about it and link to articles plus they often add their own analysis.<p>This is something that I don't think is well understood: the most broken component of most news organizations is the editing. News editors tend to be...not smart. They don't have nearly enough subject matter expertise to make intelligent decisions about how to asses factual claims in articles or how to put the news in context. If I want to read about economics, I know for a fact that any econ blogger on the planet knows a hell of a lot more than 98% of newspaper editors. What's far worse is how news organizations present politics; they behave as if political science doesn't exist. Everything is explained in terms of fictional narratives that often contradict polling while ignoring fundamentals. Reading news articles about politics makes you more ignorant, not less.<p>For example, I read Lawyers Guns and Money ( lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/ ) and when, say, a war in Georgia breaks out or a South Korean warship sinks, I know about because the LGM guys write posts with links to news sources. But since some of them are security studies professors who specialize in international relations and global security, I get the added context to make sense of it.<p>So pick some subjects that interest you, find some subject matter experts with blogs and toss them into an RSS reader.

Yes, they have Olbermann and Maddow, which are both good, fact-based shows with obvious and upfront ideological viewpoints, but that's overwhelmed by people like Scarborough, Buchannan, Matthews, etc. The presence of Olbermann and Maddow on MSNBC speaks mainly to that they do not want to <i></i>appear<i></i> to be as rightward-leaning as they actually are, and to the fact that fact-based programming, regardless of bent, enjoys a real lucrative niche.<p>BTW, I think people have forgotten what a ""liberal"" looks like if Olbermann is held up as the extreme of the left wing. Remember, America is in the middle of recovering from one of the most severe ideological swings in recent memory, and so things that previously were center or even slightly right-wing are now seen as being extremely liberal. For instance, Obama's health plan is extremely similar to that proposed by the Republicans in the mid 1990s. Point being, bias can be seen relative to the zeitgeist, from which view MSNBC etc can be seen to attempt to steer conversation rightwards by making issues such as ""deficit reduction"" more discussed than issues such as ""unemployment."" Olbermann and Maddow spend much of their time defending their own views, and rarely set the tone of the conversation.",1278908531

Having used Haskell in university only, articles like this really make me want to revisit the language.<p>(Algorithms aside, the full sort of 10M numbers, apparently using an underlying C implementation, looks stunishingly slow: Given at most 240M comparisons for merge-sorting the array, taking 10s would mean at throughput only 24M items per sec, bad memory access pattern at play maybe?)",1307264344

2621654,comment,2621425,2621638,4,0,_delirium,,,"I tend to see using 4-8 cores as having roughly the same use case as compiler optimizations: making code running on one box do so faster, usually by a constant factor. That's a pretty big use case, though. If, for example, a significant part of Matlab's built-in functions could use all 4 of my cores, and got maybe a 2x speedup overall from doing so, that'd be pretty great. (Matlab in particular seems to have already added quite a bit of this.)",1307264038

This is the way everybody feels before they try to run a community site.<p>But the thing is, as soon as you have a big community that you're personally responsible for, you find that there are people who you just <i>really</i> wish would go away.  They're making the place worse, possibly without even realizing it.  You need to get rid of them, but if you kick them out explicitly they'll just make a new account and come back.  The most important thing is to stop them making things worse right now.  Anything else is secondary.<p>It's important to consider that online communities are in no way democratic and do not have the concept of ""free speech"".  That's tough to swallow, having spent your whole life knowing how free speech is the most important thing ever.<p>""Free Speech"" is you being able to write whatever you want on your blog without the government taking it down.

Get off my lawn.)<p>Plenty of the Internet's programming culture is driven by fashion. I saw plenty of projects written in Java in the early 2000s because that's ""what investors want[ed]"". When some of those Java programmers woke up from their XML-as-configuration comas in 2005 and 2006, they brought that sense of mission with them to Rails, ignoring the almost 20 years of dynamic languages getting things done up to that point. (No XML situps? Monkeypatching instead of Spring? Naked objects instead of beans? Auto-generated accessors? Ruby and Rails invented none of that, but good for Rails for attracting an audience.)<p>Ruby's a decent language, but it still suffers the growing pains of adolescence. It'll catch up.

They're losing money because a bunch of established businesses could come in and take over if they don't.""<p>It's not one argument or the other - that's a false dichotomy. It could be that, <i>right now</i> they're still vulnerable, but are doing what needs to be done to build their ""defensible moat"".<p>And in fact, this makes perfect sense. They're a <i>very</i> young business, they're spending a lot of money building their economic fortress. The fact that they aren't profitable is surprising, but for such a young company not <i>too</i> surprising.<p>""There is nothing wrong with taking some money off the table so the early investors/employees aren't operating under undue risk, but the scale of cash-out at Groupon is more than a bit fishy.""<p>I agree, but I'm not sure I get this argument. Isn't this something that the investors decide? I mean, it's not like the founders were duping anyone. They went up to some VCs, asked them to buy a big portion of their shares, and the VCs agreed (after thoroughly looking at the numbers, I might add). The investors seemed fine with it and considered it a good investment nonetheless, so what does it prove? Nobody was duped here.<p>I think the only difference between what's happening now with Groupon and what usually happens with small startups is the scale of money involved.

2621613,comment,2620974,2621169,1,0,twink,,,"> Perfectionism is a nasty beast. Are you a perfectionist too?<p>Unfortunately, yes. And I'm definitely treating life as an optimization problem. However, most of the time I don't see the big picture. For example, I spend hours or days figuring out the ""best"" piece of hardware to buy (e.g., a new monitor), and then another day trying find the best offer. Usually I get frustrated the more options I find. Quite often, after many wasted hours, I end up buying nothing at all.<p>Other people would just ""google"" for ""monitor test 2011"", take #1 from the list, get it from their local dealer, and spend the rest of the day working on an interesting project or earning money (or both). What a happy life.<p>> I have found success when my hobbies and side projects intersect with each other. I finished a Flash animation when it was for a class project. I actually did learn a Haskell for Great Good when I made my senior research project ""An Investigation of Lesser-Known Programming Languages."" Then learning Haskell was not just a thing that might be cool but rather a school project that I had to finish.<p>Jup. The only programming projects I finished were school projects. That's when I have no problems getting incredibly productive, but a few minutes after the submission deadline, everything is back to normal and I waste my time sucking in random bits of information on the web.\nThere's no way to become a great programmer (builder/creator) if you only code (build/create) seriously a few times a year.<p>> If something like school motivates you, then use that to your advantage!<p>Yes, school is the only thing that really motivates me. But well, now I'm close to graduation, and I don't know yet what could replace it. That's scary.<p>> Do note that knowing a lot about a little does give you some unique advantages. If you ever do need to really learn something for a job or school project, it will be much easier than if you knew nothing about a subject. You are also more aware of what tools are available for various projects, and you can select the right tool for the right job.<p>That's true. I often notice that my tech knowledge is very exhaustive/broad compared to people who I consider experts in their particular field. They know one thing very well, I know a little about countless things.<p>However, I don't really know if that helps me as a programmer. Good programmers have to become experts in a at least a few technologies.\nMaybe I should not force myself to become a programmer. Maybe I should pick a route where there is no need to become an expert. Suggestions?<p>> If you'd like to talk, send me an email. Info's in my profile if you are interested.<p>I definitely should do so. But somehow I'm  already starting to lose all interest in fixing my problems. I'm already onto the next thing: Skimming through the Python twisted docs, just to see that I don't actually want to build anything. Sigh.",1307261327

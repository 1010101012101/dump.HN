2251978,comment,2251705,2251705,0,0,bigbang,,,"There are 2 companies which Yahoo! acquired:<p>1) Overture. If you look at the financial reports, nearly 50% of Yahoo's revenue is from search. They acquired Overture for ~1B<p>2) They acquired RocketMail (essentially Yahoo! mail). Most people I know, when they think of Yahoo, they think of Yahoo! mail.<p>So, while its easy to say they messed up many acquisitions (esp the infamous 3B offer for Broadcast.com), the 2 acquisitions they made is what keeps them ""in the game"" today. You win some acquisitions, you lose some. Just like investing, if you make few smart ones, it can easily pay off and create more value than the money spent on many failed ones. Same with Google - Youtube was handled very well, but many acquisitions are essentially just shut down or never integrated into other products(Dodgeball,Jaiku etc)",1298415553

But if half a dozen people have a product to show there where probably hundreds who initially thought that such a service would be a good idea.

It comes down to a combination of:<p>- Team: the acquirer likes the people and believes they will add value if convinced to stay on board.<p>- Product: they like what they see, and they believe they can incorporate it into something they have in a relatively painless way. They think about what it would take to build it and it's mostly a time thing. They can spend the money but generating the momentum to build it would take too long.<p>- Traction: this basically determines the price, because a company like Yahoo believes they can plug something they like into their properties and get traction. Having traction already is proof that the product is great, and it commands a premium.<p>- Keeping it out of the wrong hands: yes, it's scary to imagine what would happen if a one-of-a-kind company fell into the hands of your competitor and they executed perfectly with it.<p>- Need to spend M/A budget: if you are the M/A person at a big company, your job is to buy what you can't build or hire. You can't say ""there's nothing out there worth buying"" because other people are buying companies (herd mentality if you will).<p>There are more factors, and there isn't a single one that determines a decision.

You shouldn't assume it's a zero-sum game, and only one company can exist. If you look closely enough, you'll also see that competitors don't mirror each other as much as you would think, and they leverage their differences to their advantage.<p>Launching at the same time as a competitor creates more static in the press. I remember when the movie ""Deep Impact"" was announced close to ""Armageddon"". I thought to myself ""Jesus Christ, this is too much"". I don't think that whichever was the last one to hit the big screen was riding the coat tails of the other, or that the earliest one deserved my attention or money more than the last one.<p>Should Pepsi have called it quits, because they knew that Coca Cola were doing a coca beverage?

I finally made an appointment with the Ohio Orthopedic Center of Excellence (I highly recommend it), and the first doctor I saw (a non-knee specialist, for $85 for about a half hour) said it probably wasn't a torn ACL, but he scheduled an MRI anyways.<p>The MRI was on the order of $1200, and another appointment later (this time with a knee specialist), it turned out that I did, in fact, have a torn ACL. By now, however, it had happened nearly a month prior, and the doctor recommended waiting at least two more months for the swelling to fully subside.<p>Reluctant to make such a big investment and being fearful of such a major surgery, I waited about 9 more months before I finally had the surgery. Since I didn't go to a hospital, the costs were actually reasonably low: ~$2500 each for the facilities, the anesthesiologist, and the surgeon. From diagnosis through final checkup, the cost was about $10K, and I was fortunate enough to have my doctor advise me on personal rehabilitation (I didn't go to a single session of rehab).<p>So I was lucky to get into a good facility with a good doctor and get reasonably-priced care, and now I'm stuck in a job I don't like with high credit card bills in order to pay off a large cost for a fluke basketball accident. Call me crazy, but I'd be interested in taking my chances in Canada or the UK. I've only just now (a year later) paid off the anesthesia, and I'm halfway done paying off the surgeon.",1298414320

Yesterday, after an all-night coding session, we released a new app called Where My Friends Be that takes all of your FB friends and puts them onto an animated Google Map for you to look at and share on FB.

When a dozen games are made a year and they are all generally good you can buy based on what looks interesting. Moreover, with such a small number of products the chance that someone you know has already played a recently released game and can give you an opinion on it is high. This meant that consumers had a high chance of getting something good just based on blind buying decisions and they also had a fairly easy time of learning about the gems. When the video game bubble hit full force the market was flooded with hundreds of games, many of them low quality, far too many for people to keep up with.<p>The system broke down, the chances of buying a good game just on chance were low, and thus the chances that any of your friends had happened to buy a good game was also low.

Even though there were still many quality games (donkey kong jr, joust, ms. pac man, and pole position were all released in '83), there was so much crap that people simply withdrew from the market.

We’d think we were onto something exciting because our idea was so unique, then we’d find a company doing something similar and we’d give up on that particular approach. We continued this vicious cycle for 4 months until we realized that absolutely no one else had heard of the ‘competition’ we’d found. It turns out that it’s actually really, really hard to get people to pay attention or use anything.

We love to work on things like NoSQL, the CAP-theroem, large scale caching and whatnot. But I think that the organization often becomes the bottleneck quicker than the web site. This is especially true now when we have services like Amazon AWS and GAE which helps us with the technical scalability issues.<p>So next time you work on that really cool memory optimization maybe you should ask yourself if you don't get better scalability as a whole if you focus your limited programming resources on features instead (so you don't have to hire that extra programmer to do that for you, since you work on your memory optimization).",1298413449

""use ftp as local drive""), and be amazed by the variety of tools available :)<p>> What are the programs and technologies that you use yourself and that you would recommend?<p>Taking care of the whole webdev site of our web-based startup, here's what my current configuration looks like.<p>Assuming: Windows as the dev machine, Debian/ubuntu, or shared web hosting on the server side<p>* Total commander: is my file navigator of choice -shows 2 tabs of filelist side-by-side, can bookmark any number of directories, many awesomeness included.<p>* Webdrive: mounts a remote FTP / SFTP / SSH account as a local drive. Check the ""support for FTP"" requirement off of your texteditor of choice.<p>* Putty: if you've got shell access to the remote machine, running two of these parallel:\n   tail -f ./access.log     \n   tail -f ./errors.log\n   will give you a realtime view of what's happening of your web server, and what error messages did you generated \n   -the later isn't always readily available, esp. if you start getting into ajax<p>* Notepad++   : has a nice syntax highlighting, an awful lot of shortcuts, support for unix-encoding (on windows), amongst many features.<p>* Git: you will need to do version control.<p>Here's how this works together:<p>* Have 2 machines, 1 for dev, 1 for live, both using a dedicated machine, and a database of it's own. (quick intro how to set up a staging server: [1] )<p>* Webdrive mounts dev machine's web directory via SSH. All changes are securly transmitted to the server.<p>* REPL[2] cycle: navigate to the target of interest in Total commander, hit F4 (opens it in Notepad++), do some changes, hit CTRL+S (Webdrive automagically uploads the file), ALT+TAB (chrome), F5 (page refresh), observe changes / errors, ALT+TAB (back to notepad++), bang away. Added bonus: you'll see what you'll get while being deployed on a linux server (the differences between a WAMP, and a LAMP server can be quite a pain)<p>This allows for a REPL-cycles clocking <2sec, which I found hard to beat for remote-based REPLs :)<p>* Once the features are tested, and pre-deploy checklist is done, git add ./   , and git commit   will push this into local git repo. Then, on the live-server's side, do a git pull ssh://[staging-server]   ,and it's live. If you're having ""a learning experience"", you can always git reset   to a previous version.<p>> What are the absolute nonos, that expose an absolute amateur?<p>Standard FTP-based transfer is malleable to Man-in-the-middle attacks[3]. Notepad usually does \r\n instead of \n, which caused me some headaches with older versions of readline/writelines. Putting together design in notepad is possible, but massively sub-optimal: try sketching it with photoshop, generate some skeletons, and use this as a starting point. Local development (requesting from 127.0.0.1) allows using several javascript capabilities, which aren't available for public deployed sites.<p>I think this should you a good headstart, comment below if you have any questions :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/12/12/staging-servers-source-control-deploy-workflows-and-other-stuff-nobody-teaches-you/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/12/12/staging-servers-source-c...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack</a>",1298413050

2251813,comment,2235125,2238189,0,0,streptomycin,,,"Basically, when a cell divides, it needs to produce an extra copy of DNA. One for each daughter cell. The DNA in your cells is double stranded, which means it is basically two copies of your DNA stuck together. So each one of those copies needs to be duplicated before the cell divides.<p>You might imagine that the cell would do this by splitting the two DNA strands and sending some molecular machine down each one to replicate it. That is what it does - kind of. See, the tricky part is that the two DNA strands are pointing in opposite directions. The heads and tails of the nucleotides (A, C, T, or G) in each strand are pointed in opposite directions.<p>You might think that, if evolution can create a machine that works in one direction, it could create a machine that works in the other direction. Then, one could be used on each strand in parallel. Back in the day (~40 years ago), this is basically what everyone assumed must be happening.<p>But that's not what happens. We only have a machine that goes in one direction. People spent many, many years looking for these little molecular machines, but only ones that went in the same direction were found. None that went backwards.<p>So for the backwards strand, it's duplicated in a really convoluted process. Basically, instead of copying it all in one shot, it has to repeatedly jump ahead, work back, jump ahead, work back, creating a bunch of little DNA fragments. While it does this, all the little fragments have to be tied together. It's a very strange process.",1298412817

There is plenty of room and the market is far from decided: 14 y/o girls (not kidding), moms, music fans, sports followers or whoever else.<p>There are also a lot of really good ideas that you can apply this technology toward. To me, the most uninspired way to attack this space is to try to make your site a one-stop portal for chat. There are a lot more possibilities if you can bring the chat to other destinations, or allow people to integrate chats with their sites.<p>You should be aware that being in the startup universe tends to make your worldview myopic. You're hyperfocused on the hundreds of users Convore might have and right now that looks like they are miles ahead. Zoom out for a minute and realize that there are millions of users to be won before this game is decided. You are both still at the very <i>very</i> early part of the curve.",1298412258

2251782,comment,2251228,2251228,0,0,commieneko,,,"It's all relative, and trying to apply ""scientific visualization"" to literary criticism is not an especially useful activity. (Applying it to literary markets is another matter...)<p>Interestingly, I liked the Matrix sequels, the 3rd Spiderman movie, and thought the Star Wars prequels were pretty good (though not as good as _Empire_). And having been around at the time depicted in the latest Indiana Jones movie, late 50s early 60s, I enjoyed it tremendously.<p>I'm in my early 50s, and one of the things I've noticed over the years is that I become _less_ critical of movies and literature as I get older.  That is to say I'm much more tolerant of elements in a movie or story that would drive me nuts when I was younger.<p>When you are very young, everything is new and wonderful, then you become an adult and suddenly you start to notice that ""hey, I've seen this type of story before. And I liked it better then!""  Of course most likely the story wasn't all that new when you saw it first, but it was new to _you_. There are very few truly new storie.<p>As you get older, though, you often start looking not at the flash and the surface of stories, but at the quality of execution, at the subtleties of exposition, and the nuance of character.  You also can view the story in a larger context, both your own context, and the   context of history.  And, more importantly, you stop comparing the _qualities_ of works to the _feelings_ you had when you were twelve years old. I can tell you for sure, _nothing_ is ever going to be as much fun as whatever it was that was pushing your buttons when you were a kid.<p>As they used to say in old school science fiction fandom, ""the golden age is twelve.""<p>Sad, but true. In compensation, though, you do get a possibly deeper appreciation, and, if you let it happen, a broader range of tastes.  If you had told me 30-40 years ago that one of my favorite genres would be josei anime and manga I would have laughed in your face; once you'd explained to me what that was...<p>Having said all that, the vast bulk of movies at any given time follows Sturgeon's Law pretty closely.  Mostly shit.  We remember the gems of the past and in aggregate they seem to add up to a larger sum than the current year's turkeys.  I seem to go to the movies about as much as I did in my 20s and seem to be enjoying them at about the same rate.",1298412229

In many cases, the optimal thing for a TV to do is take the pixels coming from HDMI and display them as-is with no processing, but this minimizes differences between brands and eliminates upsell opportunities for higher-end models.

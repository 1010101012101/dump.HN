In my defense a bunch of reddit tools do the same thing:  metareddit.com, uneddit.com, redditenhancementsuite.com<p>But I&#x27;m really curious about what you said regarding sidestepping delete functionality. How do you view search engines indexing and caching of reddit and other sites? Does the Barbara Streisand effect apply? I think that the issue is way more nuanced than no &quot;sidesteppping&quot; allowed.<p>One of my main motivations for creating unedditreddit was noticing that there was a lot of baloney moderation going on. Cabals of power users can censor quite a bit and it is completely opaque as to who deleted something and for what. I think it could damage the community in the same way digg vote rings used to.",1381096688

On top of that, if you&#x27;re using a hosting/PAAS provider, she&#x27;d have to compromise their DNS infrastructure first as well.
- If you&#x27;re not checking package signatures, then hopefully your system doesn&#x27;t have any &quot;interesting&quot; information (including username/password combinations that might be useful on your or other sites).  The hosting/PAAS provider DNS system is still a barrier, but now you&#x27;re down _two_ of the protections on the chain of code executing in your name.<p>As always, there are multiple-order-of-magnitude differences in the amount of effort any given element of security is worth; the above fix might be just fine for 99% of applications, while for the remaining 1% some extra thought would be worthwhile.  TBH I have no idea how common such &quot;code hijacking&quot; attacks are in practice -- if any &quot;real&quot; security professionals have that info, I&#x27;d be curious to hear your thoughts.<p>Offered in the spirit of helping folks with managers asking &quot;why can&#x27;t we just turn off SSL?&quot;",1381096286

6505586,comment,6503386,6505318,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"The challenge here is that the mortgage has a different valuing scheme than the property. The mortgage is valued against the rate of return and the risk of default. The property is valued against comparable properties.<p>The whole problem here is that you might have a $200K mortgage which is written to a very credit worthy borrower who is paying on time, against a house with a market value of $100K (probably not in the Bay Area but this is just an example).<p>So the fair market value of a $200K mortgage, that matures in 2033 might be $100k (this is essentially a zero coupon bond at this point and we&#x27;re assuming a 3.5% rate of return) could be &quot;destroyed&quot; (which is to say seized by eminent domain) and replaced with a $100K mortgage that matures in 2043 (assuming a 30 yr mortgage). That is worth something like $35,000 (again assuming an annual rate of 3.5%) which quite a bit less than $100K,<p>So looking at it as an investor you&#x27;ve had $100K worth of &quot;principal&quot; stolen from your retirement account by the City of Richmond, and sold to someone else for basically 1/3 the price, because the underlying basis for this particular investment vehicle was someones home, which is now underwater value wise.<p>The saddest part of the mortgage mess is that it is so freakishly complicated to figure out what or who owns a mortgage in the world of derivatives. If Richmond is successful (and I hope they are) the next story will be people who have this sudden drop in their 401k investment value with a note &quot;Funds taken by City of Richmond&quot; ) and those folks are going to go &quot;WTF?&quot; and the next round of scare stories will be &quot;Richmond just yanked nearly a billion dollars out of people 401k funds and gave them to a Hedge fund, could you be next?&quot; And nobody will be calling for the real reform which is some level of regulation on what you can and cannot do with a home mortgage security.",1381096177

By modern definitions yes, but what exactly is a democracy and what is a constitution? The confederation that came before the Swiss republic had their charter since 1291, and its cantons, being about as sovereign as a state, had constitutions long before the republic was formed. It was also a democracy, as in a largish percentage of male population had the right to vote, as opposed to all the monarchic rules in the rest of Europe. Before that you have of course Ancient Greece that probably had some sort of constitution as well[1].<p>The thing is - as you say - it&#x27;s important to not be dogmatic about these sort of things - and dogmatism often seems to me part of the American way unfortunately. While the latest amendment to the US constitution apparently has been passed in 1992[2], the constitution has never been completely revised. Noone seems to even propose such a thing, since the &#x27;founding fathers&#x27; obviously haven known best. Many shortcomings, like the election system and the lack of direct democracy, seem to go back to the limitations of information travel and organization back in the late 18th century. Others, like the president&#x27;s veto power, are stranger, since the idea of a clear separation of powers go back to well before the founding of the USA[3] - it&#x27;s hard for me to explain how George Washington was able to get this through, but it seems obvious from a European, French Republic influenced standpoint that it doesn&#x27;t belong there.

Banks and hedge funds and large companies lay people off, but they&#x27;re honest about it. They say, &quot;we had to cut jobs&quot;, and they usually pay a decent severance. Many of these startups make those look like performance-based firings in order to save face. Needless to say, that practice creates a lot of ugly behavior on all sides, and you don&#x27;t want that stuff to follow you.<p>A &quot;for cause&quot; firing (which invariably comes with no severance, and can have reputation effects, because for those words to come up on a reference check is devastating) can really fuck up your career. Also, there are a lot of venture capitalists out there who have no problem breaking with common decency and doing a &quot;back channel&quot; reference check.<p>That&#x27;s one risk. There&#x27;s more variance in startups, so the good outcomes are a lot better, but the bad outcomes are really nasty. I know people who&#x27;ve had ex-employers throw frivolous lawsuits at them, just to be vindictive, years after the fact. That kind of nonsense doesn&#x27;t happen nearly as much in big companies.<p>More relevantly, a lot of these startups don&#x27;t do much for a person&#x27;s career, as there&#x27;s a lot of junk work to go around that you won&#x27;t learn much from. If you get into your 30s and 40s and haven&#x27;t worked on a couple of serious, meaty projects-- and a lot of people haven&#x27;t-- then you start facing the age discrimination issues. I think those are probably mild for people with legitimate work experience, but the people who did lots of low-yield grunt work &quot;because it was needed&quot; and without appreciation are just screwed. You have to manage your career, and if the work available isn&#x27;t benefitting your long-term employability, move after 12 months. But... that gets me to another risk: the job-hopper stigma. It&#x27;s pretty typical in the VC-funded startup world to have more than one job per year, but it looks <i>really bad</i> if you want to go to back to traditional companies, and you might not slide back in on the best terms.<p>Unfortunately, the reality in careerist America is that age matters a lot, so you have a lot less time than you think you&#x27;ve got. It shouldn&#x27;t matter, because what really matters is how much time one has left, and a lot of us will live into our 90s (or later, if the most optimistic people are correct)  and be sharp until the end. However, the sad truth is that age does matter, and you have to manage your career pretty aggressively to avoid looking like an underachiever amid the harsh age-grading of hyper-optimistic tech companies.",1381094862

Start with the fact that python itself is usually pre-installed on most distros, and usually a recent-enough version to get you started. Ruby on the other hand is much harder to just get installed, choosing the right (minor)version, rvm/rbenv choices etc. I tend to compile my ruby, but it&#x27;s a lengthy and rather fragile process.<p>Graphite is both a good and bad example. Good because it is really complex and documentation is a little sketchy. I&#x27;ve written a fabric script[1] that automates the process, and it&#x27;s far from trivial. Bad example, because it&#x27;s not really a single app, but a system - a collection of tools with dependencies. Even if we discount the web server (nginx or apache?), it includes things like the core &quot;database&quot; (whisper), the event listener (carbon, which in itself is complex depending on your setup), the graphic and processing libraries, and then graphite which is a pretty involved django app with its own sub-components.<p>So when you say graphite, it&#x27;s really a full-blown system with lots of moving parts that need to fit in together. I can&#x27;t think of an equivalent example in the rails world, but any rails app with a db, caching layer, and a few other external components won&#x27;t be much easier to get set up and running.<p>[1]<a href=""https://github.com/gingerlime/graphite-fabric"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gingerlime/graphite-fabric</a>",1381094209

6505440,comment,6505170,6505170,5,0,psyklic,,,"Congrats! Based on my experience:<p>* Fixed-price is acceptable risk only if: (1) The project is small (e.g. <= one month), (2) The client has a precise spec (and he is hopefully technical), (3) The project is not R&D -- there is little chance of it failing or taking a lot longer than expected, and (4) Your gut says the client will be easy to work with, will pay you, won&#x27;t try to add on extra features, etc. Also, I recommend the client be a business where no one is personally invested in the money they are paying you.<p>* If the contract is hourly, generally the contract is simpler and is much less risky to you than a fixed-price one -- I would recommend hourly for a first freelance project. (Respectfully disagreeing with agibsonccc.) With fixed-price, clients can eat you alive with revisions if you aren&#x27;t extremely careful with the initial spec and being on the same page as the client. You can also easily go over your profitable window if you have not estimated software before. (A lot of it is not based on your skill, but on how particular the client ends up being.) Also, you run a good risk of not being paid at the end, unless you take precautions.<p>Keep in mind that with fixed-price bids, you are fundamentally at odds with your client -- you must finish quickly to make a profit, whereas they want a quality product. With hourly rates, you both are trying to do the project as &quot;value-based&quot; as possible, and you make decisions together based on cost.<p>If you do a fixed-price contract, then ask for half up front. (A retainer isn&#x27;t a bad idea for hourly either.) If you make a fixed-price bid, I recommend estimating the absolutely worst-case scenario hours required then multiplying by even more. I tell my clients it would end up being cheaper if they go weekly, since my fixed-price contract by necessity must be a worst-case scenario estimate.<p>Also, in general don&#x27;t transfer copyright (and hopefully the source code too) until all work is paid for. Your contract should state that it must be renegotiated if additional work is added beyond the original spec ... again, you don&#x27;t need to worry about this as much with an hourly contract with no guaranteed finish date.<p>* A better pricing model than hourly/fixed is usually weekly or monthly, where you agree to work full-time for that period and you agree to goals to be accomplished. This way, you do not have to pedantically record every hour and expose your time management skills (for better or worse :)<p>* For padding, it depends on your experience with your own work. I recommend never to guarantee finish dates in a contract, unless you have a huge multiplier. Estimating the finish date would be fine though.<p>Personally, I set my prices based on how much I want a job. If I am not excited about the project, then I am one of the highest bids (and sometimes my bid is accepted). I do recommend that if you don&#x27;t like selling, you should take the rate you were going to ask for and ask for something higher. Much of the time, the client just says okay -- worst case, he&#x27;ll just negotiate something lower.<p>* I am not a big fan of your upper limit idea. I would quote the high-end price with an hour cap. For instance, $X guaranteed for up to Z hours, then $Y/hr after that -- and you estimate it will be done by Z hours, but it&#x27;s not guaranteed. If they don&#x27;t like that, you could say it isn&#x27;t worth your time unless they buy a Z hour block for $X, then you&#x27;ll put the extra time toward improvements or whatever else they want if you finish early.<p>* If you are worried about a contract, do not hesitate to have a lawyer review it. If it is fairly standard, you can probably negotiate a fixed rate of around $200. This Nolo book has a good fill-in-the-blanks template on the CD specifically for freelance software consultants: <a href=""http://www.nolo.com/products/consultant-and-independent-contractor-agreements-cica.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nolo.com/products/consultant-and-independent-cont...</a>. The book has separate ones biased toward the employer and biased toward the contractor, so you can see the differences and what they might try to put in that would be against you. It is a pretty comprehensive contract and pretty biased toward you ... but it&#x27;s always in your favor to supply the contract rather than to accept theirs.",1381093495

It&#x27;s not a sudden crisis in the US, but has more to do with the improving and more competitive economies of other nations, which in turn makes them more attractive places for scientists to work. In the past, you could assume that people would come to the US because it was the best place for academic freedom and to have a financially rewarding science career. Now that there is more competition, we should probably be looking for ways to maintain that status rather than resting on the assumption that we&#x27;re #1.",1381093492

By way of comparison, another recent study shows 9% of the total population has considered leaving. People consider lots of things, and surveys show all kinds of nifty trends, like the percentage of people who believe we have been visited by aliens, or those thinking the moon landing was faked -- both of which, last I checked, had more traction in the public than the idea of leaving the country. People believe weird shit and hold interesting opinions. Film at 11.<p>So the title doesn&#x27;t match the essay. But wait! That&#x27;s not all! The body of the text, supposedly from a non-partisan viewpoint, is pretty much an attack on one of the political parties in the U.S. I won&#x27;t spoil the surprise for you, but I bet you can guess.<p>Among the shifting and meandering logic, we get a nice confusion of whether or not funding equals science (the two are not necessarily related) and a nice slam across corporate America&#x27;s face with the old &quot;They&#x27;re just in it for the profits&quot; routine.<p>All fairly normal and pedestrian rhetoric, but nothing much newsworthy, nothing with a supporting argument for the thesis, and nothing, frankly, that interesting.

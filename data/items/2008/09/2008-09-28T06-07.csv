I'd be very worried if I were Microsoft.<p>Also I think startups offering online services and games could possibly see a huge boost in their subscriber base if the doom scenarios play out and we have large numbers of formerly employed people with a lot of time on their hands.",1222585075

I've never really looked into them much. Others on HN might be better-versed on what to recommend based on what you're wanting to do.

You might also want to go look on forums and stuff to find out more info, I was searching around to see what was making the bare bones board different, and there were a bunch of sites talking about it, and I found a bunch of projects on instructables too, if you need ideas: <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/tag/keyword:arduino/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.instructables.com/tag/keyword:arduino/</a><p>I <i>love</i> the BSODomizer idea. I cracked up during the presentation multiple times: kingpin was showing video of using it on a coworker who thought it was a real one. And I've always pronounced BSOD as ""bee-sod"", but I don't know. I wish someone made a pronunciation dictionary of tech terms, I hear crazy variations in the pronunciations of so many...BSOD, sudo, linux and what have you.",1222584451

You do have to start where you can and with what you have - and doing one thing doesn't mean you can't do another later.<p>Sergey holds a special place in the world since he is one of the wealthiest ($15+ billion) and holds major control over one of the wealthiest companies in the world ($135+ billion - more than even Coca Cola). Most of us would say that places considerably more responsibility in his hands when it comes to taking on world problems. Just a sliver of his wealth can change the lives of millions.<p>So the letter really is an attempt at a wake-up call for Sergey. The homosexual marriage movement is wealthy, well-supported, and has a very loud megahorn. Using a public company to support a divisive political measure for already wealthy and vocal adults when there are children languishing elsewhere without a voice, just seems like a misplacement of Google's power.",1222583841

317470,comment,317155,317457,0,0,silencio,,,"Because it's outright discrimination right here that voters in california need to deal with in November that could most definitely have an effect on other states and maybe eventually countries in removing discriminatory practices: a set deadline to deal with an ugly issue that if enough people vote yes on, will mean that everyone on all sides will waste more money and time trying to fight (and oh man, the money going into these yes and no on prop 8 campaigns..). Not that that won't happen if this prop is defeated, but it would be less of a mess than it would if it were not. California's potential impact on this situation is huge. It's a start.<p>Now, if we were talking money, which afaik Google has not donated to any no-on-prop-8 campaign, then I would agree with the open letter Matt wrote, but a public statement? From Google?<p>I'm not saying AIDS orphans aren't a pressing issue as well, but organizations and companies better fit to attempt to make an impact on that and many more humanitarian crises are working right now to do so and have been for a while, and I really don't think Google doing what they did for prop 8 for AIDS orphans instead would change much. Google did something like ""Donate to $x charity!"" link on their frontpage for previous crises like hurricane katrina and the recent devastating earthquake in China, and I bet that would have a larger impact if said charity were one like MSF etc. working to treat and stop AIDS or some adoption agency specializing in AIDS orphans. Or to AIDS research. Or <i>something</i>. Feature a new one every week. Sponsor a child. Adopt a child. Anything. Now that's a cool idea (although one would have to wonder how many people would pay attention, what kind of usability impact it would have on the site, and how many people would just see if they could remove that on their personalized page..).<p>The world sucks, honestly, but just because one problem is a lot worse than another doesn't mean that the lesser problem should be pushed aside for the sake of the larger problem. They're not exclusive, and some entities are just better fit to help on one than another.",1222583283

317466,comment,317155,317379,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Yeah, my point is not that there's anything wrong with being edgy or allocating brand for some public good. Look at Bono and the One campaign for example.<p>The point is that Sergey has many ""public good"" issues to choose from. Some issues will have far greater impact on relieving suffering in this world - especially for those who have little or no voice themselves. Some issues will have a much smaller impact, especially for those who already have a lot of power and are wealthy and very vocal about their issues. Some issues will be very divisive among Google shareholders and users. Some issues will be very uniting.<p>It's really a matter of choosing what to do with your resources - and Google is a public company now - not a privately owned company by Larry and Sergey. Employees and shareholders are on both sides of this issue - what may be 'obviously the right thing to do' for some of his shareholders is 'obviously the wrong thing to do' for others. This is a divisive move for his company on an issue trying to help already very powerful and wealthy advocates. To spend brand capital so heavily and unilaterally like this when you could be doing so much good elsewhere and at the same time build unity among shareholders and strengthen your brand - just seems like a poor decision.",1222582455
317465,comment,317155,317388,0,0,rms,,,"The ideal solution is domestic partnerships at the federal level -- for ALL people, regardless of their combination of sex. However, the federal government is never going to relinquish the power of marriage. We're stuck with the state regulating a religious issue. Within this framework, the difference between domestic partnerships is mostly emotional. It is incredibly insulting to suggest that something ""separate but equal"" is a good solution. Beyond that emotional issue, it is unlikely that something intended to be different in name only would only be different in name only.",1222582425

That link which I once read(although I don't own an iphone) tells how to control a Lego Mindstorms with iPhone.<p>I checked the Mindstorms website too and was confused what to start with. It mentions all about Indiana Jones and Batman and Bionicle but nothing about what should be bought to build these stuff.<p>Anyway, since you mentioned the Arduino boards (which also is the apple of my eye since you mentioned it is cheaper), I chose a seller from Austrialia, that is close to my country (all other retailers have websites in Japanese or languages that seem like Japanese to me).

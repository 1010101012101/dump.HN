I assume it&#x27;s legal (I&#x27;m taking a risk), or at least it&#x27;s tolerated by my neighbors and police officers walking by. This is probably because it&#x27;s only me, I&#x27;m not causing any trouble, I share, and clean up.  I assume if everyone started BBQing (or someone started complaining about me) the local government would need to look into it and figure something out:  Is he breaking a law?  Do we need a law?  A guideline?  A public BBQ?  Etc.  At this point common sense and public debate can start.  It&#x27;d be silly for me to run for mayor or start a statewide proposition for sidewalk BBQing when I just want some hot dogs.<p>Tech workers needed to get from their houses to their office, but there was no existing convenient way of doing this.  So they bought a bus.  Then more.  Others followed.  Now there are some questions arising and society (read: government) needs to get involved.  How many busses are allowed?  Can they use bus stops?  Should we charge them?  A little for usage or a lot for subsidizing other&#x27;s transport?  Should Muni buy new comfy buses with wifi and run new routes to mountain view?  Can they do that or does the other transit authority have rules against that?  Would people ride this, or would it be a waste of money?<p>Perfectly reasonable questions, which should be debated and negotiated.

Various notions of safety and the prohibition of nested complex terms (e.g. `f(f(x))&#x27;) guarantee termination. Most importantly though, solutions to an answer set program are not proofs (as in Prolog) but truth-assignments of atoms (&quot;answer sets&quot;). In this specific encoding there&#x27;s no significant difference though, as we&#x27;re only computing a single answer set containing an atom &quot;pdMax(X)&quot; with the maximum palindrome X.<p>Solving answer set programs usually involves heuristics and much work along the lines of SAT solving.

They&#x27;re pretty &quot;declarative&quot; these days. You write what code you want to compile, and the compiler will pass it through a thousand transformation stages, deciding which trick to apply at every instruction, which code isn&#x27;t really needed and so on.<p>Of course, then you also need to deal with compilers getting it wrong too, so you start tweaking your code with special words like &quot;volatile&quot; and &quot;restricted&quot;, mess with compiler options, and sometimes even disassemble code to see why turning the &quot;fast&quot; options makes your code slow. But in general, high quality compilers do this dance way better than SQL.<p>So what&#x27;s the moral here? Two things.<p>First, calling something &quot;declarative&quot; doesn&#x27;t really mean anything. It means the language is built on a very thick abstraction that lets the computer do more work than usual, so you can do less work.<p>Second, thick abstractions are leaky. Works for basic cases, past that you&#x27;ll still end up doing a lot of work, but now you have to <i>fight your computer while doing it</i>, as well.<p>The Z3 Theorem Prover is an interesting toy, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust it to do anything right in the real world.

It is very likely that even those who never vote would pay some attention to those fresh random items on the top of the frontpage, check them out and eventually vote. In fact, the ""new"" page is no longer relevant in this case.<p>Regardless, the original idea is brilliant.",1177962078

18204,comment,18201,18201,0,0,brett,,,"An interesting idea but it comes at a pretty high cost. Digg and reddit work well because of the simple design; they are essentially lists of links.

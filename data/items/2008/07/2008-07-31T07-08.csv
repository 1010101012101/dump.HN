262786,comment,262719,262719,0,0,swombat,,,"Fantastic and ironic in a sweet way. I've never dealt with VCs myself (firm believer in bootstrapping + angel funding), but I can imagine many VCs turned down deals on the basis that the start-up was competing with Google, or that Google was likely to move into the start-up's space... Now Google's moving into <i>their</i> space.",1217490800

262784,comment,262078,262685,0,0,swombat,,,"I think that for web applications, ORM is the right word. In fact, for almost anything that uses a database, an ORM is warranted. This is from someone who's done it both ways several times, including writing my own ORM a couple of times both as a side-project and as part of a project that ""didn't need ORM"".",1217490662

262781,comment,262078,262543,0,0,swombat,,,"Because relational databases are an extremely stable and reliable persistence layer, that is widely understood, can usually be scaled up through various well practiced techniques from clustering to sharding, and makes it easy to optimise the handful of bottlenecks you're guaranteed to run into by bypassing the ORM system and doing some direct SQL or stored proc queries for those handful of bits that need it.",1217490562
262780,comment,262341,262498,0,0,sgibat,,,"People lack critical thinking skills and the power to change their emotional schema, the way they deal with events in their lives. They are a product of their environment. So where on the giant can we attack with the greatest work/reward ratio? Education? Media? I don't know.

If youve got good numbers as youve showed theres every chance you can try for funding.<p>I must also note that while I am very glad you have succeded in your milestone and its obvious benefits from a marketing standpoint, I find the whole area of self promotion on such an early scale somewhat of a recipe of disaster.  My own startup (Travel social networking / Commerce site) is in private until september time yet from friends, family and testers our turnover and profit in the last 4 weeks dwarfs this figure.  I could easily push these figures for marketing purposes but until i have sustained traction in  reaching our targets they add no real benefit to us.<p>Nonetheless good job, but go get some extra help with that money!!",1217489188

262772,comment,262625,262625,0,0,BrandonM,,,"From the article:<p><i>String reverse<p>Python doesnâ€™t have a built-in reverse method for strings. Luckily, this can be easily done with slices:<p><pre><code>  def reverse(str):
      return str[::-1]</code></pre>
</i><p>If you don't like str[::-1] (even though it is a common idiom), you could just use<p><pre><code>  """".join(reversed(str))

Is reversing a string really common enough to have a special function for it with such a general name like reverse?",1217488824

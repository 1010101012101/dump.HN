8611242,comment,8609311,8610597,0,0,stoolpigeon,,,"It&#x27;s less than smaller boats but still noticeable. I have to say I have a ton of respect for the guys who fish in those little boats. The reason I love the show Deadliest Catch is I did a cruise up around the Aleutians. (PACEX &#x27;89) I remember how crazy it was up there on a carrier, in the fall. I can&#x27;t imagine doing it in the winter on one of those little fishing boats.<p>One of my jobs for a little while was on the flight deck, manning the push pull bar. The job is not rocket science. When an aircraft is recovered, it pulls out quite a bit of cable onto the flight deck. Once the aircraft is unhooked from the cable there is a period of time where, due to rolling, the cable can slide towards the starboard side of the ship and out of the landing area. This could potentially cause damage to equipment or people, once it retracts. So I stood there with a long metal rod that had a metal block at the bottom. My job was to push the cable back so that it did not come over the foul line. My training consisted of being told, &quot;If you look that way (he pointed off the port side) and you see a lot of water, push. If you see a lot of sky, you don&#x27;t have to push.&quot;<p>The Ponce is an LPD and considerably smaller than a CVN. My guess would be that the aiming is completely automated.<p>I did reserves after active duty. I spent a couple weeks on a frigate once. They did some practice with the gun the boat had. They put out a target and first did things manually. They couldn&#x27;t come close to hit that target. Then they switched over to the computer and it never missed.",1416041757

That part of the system worked well. ... My complaint is strictly with Caltech.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s tension between the openness that a research university (Caltech) needs, and the secure handling of information that a lab doing some classified research (JPL) requires.<p>This tension exploded in 1952, when Caltech took government money for PROJECT VISTA. After that, Caltech decided that having faculty working on things they couldn&#x27;t talk about was antithetical to the purpose of a research university [1]. Today, Caltech says [2]:<p>&quot;The Caltech Way: Caltech policy does not allow the acceptance of grants or contracts supporting the conduct of classified research or other classified projects on campus. Exceptions to this restriction may be considered by the President of Caltech in times of national emergency or critical need upon an urgent request of the government.&quot; (&quot;Standards of Conduct for Research on Campus,&quot; Chapter 1, Section 1.1).<p>At JPL, there has always been some classified research. In the 1980s, JPL almost become a weapons lab (it did not) [3].<p>Even if Dr. Gat&#x27;s electrospray work wasn&#x27;t classified, one can imagine how different attitudes to classified research feed over to different attitudes to ITAR violations.<p>I&#x27;m a former Caltech postdoc and a research associate at JPL.

In fact, new books probably don&#x27;t, if we take into account the vast number of them being written every year. And I do think that if someone has written something great, a discount is unlikely going to do it any real damage. The point is that good books will be good, and their newness has little to do with it. Conversely, classics are classics for a reason.<p>That probably leaves the question about books that become &quot;accidental hits&quot; or &quot;sleeper hits&quot;. But even then, this discounts aren&#x27;t going to completely wipe them out and I would believe that these sorts are the exception rather than the norm. Again, there are simply so many new books published all the time, and very little of it can possibly be good.<p>Gwern has some good thoughts that I feel are relevant:<p><a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Culture%20is%20not%20about%20Esthetics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Culture%20is%20not%20about%20Esthetics</a>",1416040428

Most of the time memory bandwidth is the limiting factor, thus copying memory and cleaning up unused memory are very expensive.

8611186,comment,8607499,8608800,0,0,sdrothrock,,,"> My favorite story to relay is an Indian woman whose husband came to the U.S. on an H1B visa. She came here on an unskilled visa. In her spare time at home while she was working as a maid, she taught herself programming. A year later she was making $60,000 per year. A few years later, making $80,000 per year.<p>As a counterpoint, have you thought that it might not be the &quot;ability to code,&quot; but rather the &quot;drive to learn&quot; that causes these people to be successful? I think that even if everyone could code, they wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be successful, whereas someone who had that drive to go out, learn, expose themselves to new ideas, etc. presumably also has the drive to sell themselves and keep pushing.",1416039299

In the situation I was sketching, there is no measurement, no collapse, and the &quot;measurement problem&quot; does not play a role. Here is a concrete example: Suppose that you have three spins that are in a superposition of |000> and |111>. Alice has one the spins, Bob the other spin, and the third one belongs to the environment. The reduced state of any two of the three spins is NOT entangled. Therefore, Alice and Bob which will not be able violate any Bell inequality, win a CHSH game, distill Bell pairs, etc. if they only control two of the three spins. It is irrelevant that Alice is entangled with the joint system of Bob and Eve.<p>Again, the basic point is that the notion of entanglement refers to a choice of subsystems. Your statement that &quot;All components of a quantum system are always entangled&quot; is either trivializing the discussion or demonstrably false.",1416038793

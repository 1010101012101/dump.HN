Without electricity there is no water, no sewage treatment. Within a few days, at-risk people start dying. By the thousands.<p>And let&#x27;s say that power can&#x27;t be restored for years (see quote above). Then what exactly do you do with those people? They can&#x27;t live in NYC without electricity. Period.<p>So do you try to move them to refugee camps in the country? Really? Eight million plus people? How do you feed them? How do they get water? And if the problem is happening in NYC it&#x27;s probably happening all over the country, so it&#x27;s not like all of the USA&#x27;s resources can be devoted to just the NYC metro area.<p>There are farms and houses in the country that have outhouses and have water wells that can be pumped by hand. They have stored food. But that&#x27;s such a small portion of the country. 90% of the country would have a hard time surviving an extended period without electricity.<p>Fortunately this is truly a first world problem. There are so many people in other countries that live a day-to-day subsistence life, without electricity. They grow their own food (or trade locally for it), they don&#x27;t depend on it being delivered every few days to within a few miles of them. Those people will be fine.",1440222386

10101653,comment,10101469,10101469,0,0,mrb,,,"I was visiting China recently (my first time there). I thought bypassing The Great Firewall was going to be as simple as an &quot;ssh -D&quot; SOCKS setup, or a &quot;ssh -w&quot; tunnel. Oh boy, I was wrong. If you try this, or even a basic OpenVPN setup, you will quickly find out your VPN works fine for about 5 minutes, but then latency increases to 5sec, 10sec, 30sec(!), and then everything times out. After some research I read online the government does deep packet analysis and uses machine learning to find heuristics to guess which TCP connection or UDP stream is likely being used as a VPN. When they think there is a high probability a VPN is detected, they simply start dropping all the packets.<p>Encryption is not enough. You need to disguise your VPN traffic to make it look like standard HTTPS sessions (since they don&#x27;t block HTTPS). For example in a traditional HTTPS session, if the client browser downloads, say, a 500kB image over HTTPS, it will send periodical empty TCP ACK packets as it receives the data. But when using a VPN that encrypts data at the IP layer, these empty ACK packets will be encrypted, so The Great Firewall will see the client sending small ~80-120 bytes encrypted packets, and will count this as one more sign that this might be a VPN.<p>That&#x27;s why people in China have to use VPN tools that most westerners have never heard of: obfsproxy, ShadowVPN, SoftEther, gohop, etc. All these tools try to obfuscate and hide VPNs. I have a lot of respect for all these Chinese hackers like clowwindy who try to escape censorship, as it takes more technical prowess than you think to design a VPN that works in China.",1440222254

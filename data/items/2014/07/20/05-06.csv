I hate to say this on this board, but I&#x27;ll be glad when the tech bubble bursts.  I have some friends in San Francisco and I&#x27;m so glad they are protected by rent control.  Marin County only has rent control in San Anselmo.\nIf you live in San Anselmo and you live in a detached &quot;Mother in-law&quot; unit you have rent control.  As to Landlords, who consistently raise rents to whatever the market bares--don&#x27;t complain when your Tenants really don&#x27;t \ngive a dam about your property, or you?    Your tenants know \nthe difference between gouging, and reasonable rent increases.  Being a Landlord is a little different than\nmaking money in the stock market.  That person who has \ncarved out a litte life in your community, and home--sometimes as to pass you in the Hallway in order to get to \nthe bathroom?  &quot;But, I&#x27;m just doing what Everyone else is doing?&quot;  Sometimes--relationships are more important than \nmaximizing capital, maybe that&#x27;s how the term mother in-law\nunit came to fruition?  &quot;Hell, throw her out--I hear it&#x27;s \ncheap to live in Chicago?

Generally there is a bit you can flip (either in memory-mapped IO or as a coprocessor instruction) to turn cache into RAM, which is how most ARM boot roms work.<p>Furthermore, most embedded platforms simply hardcode the timing values for the variety of RAM that they put down on the board.  Since you know that the RAM, CPU, and board won&#x27;t change, you can calibrate once and be done with it.<p>For Novena, we support swapping DDR3 modules, so we need to recalibrate on every boot.  We&#x27;re not so restricted, since we have a good 128k (or 256k) of on-chip cache-as-RAM, so we just do it all in C.  Of course it starts out with reading the RAM configuration out of the SPD chip on the module, but timing calibration must be completed regardless.

Its more along the lines of ending a phone call when the other person is in a low-service area. The point of talking is to communicate, and communication only happens when the people understand each other.<p>I get the same thing with my sometimes spotty grasp on the German language. While, for the most part, I can be understood just fine from Berlin to Munich, eventually people get frustrated and ask me to switch to English. Not because I&#x27;m American, but because I&#x27;m terrible at speaking German. It just takes too long for me to understand them or to make myself understood.<p>So I agree that racism sometimes stems from being uncomfortable around people who are different, but I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as to say being uncomfortable around people who are different is necessarily similar to being racist.",1405832984

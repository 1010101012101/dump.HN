4071837,comment,4068229,4069225,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"The bubble isn't in valuations, which are reasonable. Rather, the bubble is in the high value that some very talented people are giving to subordinate positions in startups that ""seem"" cool, not based on business or career considerations, but irrelevancies like whether there's an XBox on site. They're doing themselves a disservice by taking positions that tout themselves as the ""startup experience"" but involve none of the investor contact, mentoring, or career development that they'd actually need in order to become founders for real (I.e. with enough contacts and resources to do it right and without risking personal financial ruin). They'd be better served if they took technical positions at more established and traditional companies, whether these be larger corporations or ""lifestyle"" businesses.<p>Of course, there are a lot of great startups out there, where a person can learn a lot very quickly, but those are not all of them and joining a company because ""it's a startup!"" is, without more knowledge, a bad idea.<p>That's the bubble I see: people taking jobs in dodgy startups for ridiculously low equity slices based on information that's either biased or only validated by the ridiculous echo chamber, thinking that their position as Employee #57 is going to make them real founder material in 8 months (because the CEO will just give them investor contact).

You are thinking in a way that a lot of other people share, but it's not practical. In the real world you have to learn new technologies and languages consistently. Every day something new comes out or gets improved that makes doing a difficult task easier, and people/companies that can adapt and not be left behind do well.<p>If I were in your position (which I guess I kind of am, I'm also college-age but I've spent just under half my life doing some level of professional programming) I would be learning EVERYTHING I can or at least everything mainstream I can so that if I come by a cool piece of code online or at work I can tell exactly what it does.<p>It's true that PHP isn't as a strictly written language as some of the other languages (by this I don't mean syntax, I mean that doing two analogous operations have completely different names/attribute orders in the standard library) but it's still used by tons and tons of people.

Or do you mean that you learning PHP to work at Facebook would be a waste of your time? I don't understand how either of these two statement could be argued so if you meant something else I'd love a clarification.<p>There is absolutely nothing that Facebook <i>can not</i> do with PHP that they could do with Python or Ruby. Any business logic can be written in a myriad of ways. And I believe to be a strong candidate for a ""wow"" employee after you graduate you should be able to drop head first into any codebase and at the very least quickly get a simple grasp of what's going on.<p>If Facebook gave you an internship today would you reject it because you've heard bad things about PHP?<p>Sorry about the rant, but I've spent a lot of time working to hire other developers and it really irks me when I hear something like ""oh so and so's a dying language, it's useless to learn it"" because it shows that you don't have the drive and love of technology that my ideal person would.",1338942797

4071689,comment,4071032,4071116,3,0,vdondeti,,,"I have tried both Namejet and Snapnames recently. I used Namejet two times to try to get domains that expired and were under redemption. For Namejet you need to place a backorder and state the amount you are willing to pay, though I believe there is a minimum of $70. You do not need to pay upfront and pay only if you win the domain. You just place the backorder wait until the domain is released, when it is released if Namejet is able to get it, Namejet will charge you, provided no one else is bidding on the same domain name. If someone else is bidding on it, the domain will enter an auction. In my case, Namejet was successful for the first domain I backordered. No one else bid on it, so I got it right away. Namejet transfered the domain to eNom, paid the registration fee for 1 year, and gave me the login. The second time I tried Namejet, it failed to get the  domain I wanted when the domain was released. I immediately found out that the domain was acquired by Snapnames based on an updated whois entry. Snapnames was conducting an auction on the domain I wanted, which they just acquired. I bid on it and the auction lasted for 3 days. At the end of the auction, there were no other bidders and so I got my domain for the low price of $19, Snapnames' minimum bid for this particular domain. My suggestion would to be to try both Namejet and Sanpnames, since you don't have to pay anything unless you win, though you do need to provide you credit card number. Also, you want to follow the whois records carefully for your domain of interest. I find GoDaddy's domain monitoring service very useful for monitoring whois records for domains I own and for domains I may want to own.  It is quite affordable and a very good service.

I'll assume you are correct though, but you might want to make sure that this is the case. For answering I'll assume that you are correct. Asking for only publish_actions is the way to go, I have metrics on it, but I can prove it mathematically / logically, so I don't have to use stats for it....<p>- publish_stream always gets asked on the extended permissions page<p>- publish_actions will get asked on the first page, except if you ask for publish_stream too, in which case both show up in extended permissions<p>- when you make a story post, you don't get to decide under which permission to do it, Facebook just check to make sure that you've the proper permissions.<p>- if a user has given publish_stream, then the stories are visible to the posting user in their newsfeed.<p>- if a user has publish_actions, then that story is NOT visible to the posting user in their newsfeed, but their friends can see it, and they can see it on their timeline.<p>- if you have both perms for a user, then when you make a post on behalf of that user, Facebook will make it in the style of a publish_action story, so the posting user won't see it. So to a practical effect, it is not really useful to have publish_stream if you already have publish_actions.<p>So, given the above observations about Facebook and applying it to your case, because you are asking for both perms then they both are on the extended permissions page. Because you have both perms, when you post a story it is going out in the publish_actions style.<p>If you look at the funnel, it is:<p>Current: sign in with FB > regular perms > extended perms > signed in.<p>Proposed: sign in with FB > regular perms >  signed in.<p>The proposed solution is better because:<p>- it removes a step in the funnel. You probably have double digit drop off from one step to the next, so that helps dramatically with virality.<p>- publish_actions moves from extended to regular permissions, so you get that earlier<p>- you don't lose anything by not having publish_stream, because if you have publish_actions then your story posts are done like publish_actions and not publish_stream, so it is a perm that you aren't really using or need.<p>The con of the proposal is that publish actions requires a token, and the token expires after 60 days if the user doesn't come back. Internally I've found that stale users like that aren't that useful as a viral channel anyway. So it isn't really much of a con.",1338941085

Skills:<p>Either business skills or the stuff I am deficient in: flash (seems like cool demos cant exist without them), javascript (to manipulate different media players), and able to design nice web pages.<p>If you are a developer, I expect you to be very competent.<p>I have an application that IMHO is different. It is close to beta, and I wrote it in Swing, Java.
However, people say it is not user friendly. I have also lost a lot of time (in part, because I am cautious and also had bad advice. I should have released it long ago).<p>
I am willing to give you a one hour online demo/presentation. However I would need some kind of assurance from you
that the ideas will not be copied nor given or divulged to potential competitors.<p>Please email me and tell me more about yourself and if you think there might be a good match.<p>thanks,<p>Anil Philip<p>anil@juwo.com<p><a href=""http://juwo-works.blogspot.com/"">http://juwo-works.blogspot.com/</a><p><a href=""http://juwo.com"">http://juwo.com</a>

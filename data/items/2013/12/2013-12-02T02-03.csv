6831194,comment,6830566,6830950,8,0,waterlesscloud,,,"The &quot;Why&quot; has to do with increasing market size for Amazon.<p>If they can deliver small items to you in 30 minutes with no delivery fee, all sorts of things you need in the very short term stop being a trip to the store and become a drone shipment from Amazon. This opens up HUGE markets for them.<p>I also think people are thinking of the distribution network a bit wrong. They can keep a large number of items in a small space, particularly if the warehouse becomes sort of like those old magnetic tape storage robots you used to see.   You could condense an entire Wallgreen&#x27;s (almost every item of which is drone-able) down to a large room. So the practicality of having a number of them in a city becomes more and more viable.  Of course you&#x27;d have software optimizing for the most common items on a per-distribution center basis (I bet Amazon already does this on a macro scale).<p>Add in long-haul robotic trucks feeding the distribution centers and you can see where this is going.",1385953197

If it&#x27;s only possible to deliver this to suburban homes in Little Rock, Arkansas, and they lose money on each delivery, then they still can do it.",1385953196

I was doing a test for if (_gaq) before trying to push into the array, because I wasn&#x27;t more concerned with giving the users a good experience than tracking page views, and that did work if Google Analytics was being blocked from loading at all. Unfortunately, I eventually learned that Disconnect was causing that test to throw a JavaScript exception instead of just blocking GA from loading and leaving _gaq undefined. As you can imagine, narrowing down that it was Disconnect causing the problem from a few random users&#x27; &quot;the site isn&#x27;t working&quot; complaints was a lot of fun...<p>It&#x27;s not a huge site, but I do spend a couple thousand dollars a year keeping it online.

6831158,comment,6830306,6830306,14,0,shadowfiend,,,"> Even if these libraries get cached in the browser it’s still quite a lot of JavaScript that’s executed every time a site is loaded.<p>Is it? 39 libraries that are 35 lines of code each or just define a bunch of functions that your code can then call optionally may well not take that long to parse. How many gems does the typical Rails application use? Libraries are the equivalent on the web, only someone else doesn&#x27;t resolve the dependencies; you have to include the dependencies manually. Is it that surprising that people are using a variety of helper libraries to do ads, analytics, DOM manipulation, etc, etc? That&#x27;s fairly standard for development.<p>I think saying we&#x27;re “drowning in JavaScript” because we&#x27;ve gotten a lot better at modularizing our code instead of copy-pasting it from everywhere seems like lamenting the wrong part of the problem by far. I would rather every site include Google Analytics, DoubleClick, jQuery, and 10 jQuery UI plugins than be subjected to the cascade of security and functionality bugs folks would run into if everyone was trying to roll their own solution for everything. There are already enough with the use of common code.<p>Using libraries for third party code is good, and the fact that we&#x27;re doing it is a step forward, not a step back. Now, there may be room for folks to choose the third party code more wisely, but that&#x27;s a perennial problem when you&#x27;re willing to use code that&#x27;s already been written.",1385952809

What if you&#x27;re the victim of a crime? A more honest title for this video would be “Talking to the police will only make you more likely to be convicted of a crime”. An infinitely-selfish person might interpret that as “Never talk to the police” (although even that interpretation has its weaknesses), but a reasonable, respectable person should consider the positive consequences of talking to the police and weigh them with the possibility that they will end up being wrongly convicted of a crime.<p>If you&#x27;re innocent and have information that could potentially help stop a criminal from committing more crimes (as in OP&#x27;s case, assuming his story is true), I think that in most cases it&#x27;s totally reasonable to talk to the police, since the benefit to society would almost always outweigh the small possibility of being wrongly convicted of a crime. If you know that you&#x27;re suspected of a crime, or that the police are likely to suspect you of a crime after you give them information (as OP potentially could have foreseen), then the question gets harder.

6831034,comment,6830268,6830268,35,0,jonnathanson,,,"California accounts for nearly a quarter of the entire homeless population in the United States [1], largely due to its climate, its support programs, and its dense network of municipal services and population centers. Approximately 14% of all homeless in the US are military veterans, many of whom suffer from PTSD and were turned out of VA clinics in the 1970s and 1980s due to budget cutbacks. The article is correct in placing a lot of the blame on Reagan, who as governor of CA and president of the US, aggressively scaled back support for both veterans in specific, and the homeless in general. As the article mentions, he also closed a lot of psychiatric hospitals, whose inpatients were turned out onto the streets, left to their own devices. Reagan wasn&#x27;t the only legislator responsible for this turn of events, but he was probably the most powerful.<p>Perhaps homelessness is inevitable to some degree. Perhaps some proportion of the population in a laissez-faire, competitive country like the modern US is always going to fall through the cracks. Perhaps we lack the will or the budget to solve the problem completely or permanently. Perhaps some people just can&#x27;t be saved. I&#x27;m not going to launch into an armchair, pollyannaish prescription for solving this problem when I don&#x27;t have a fantastic solution. (That said, I suspect the best long-term solution is at least as preventive as it is rehabilitative.)<p>Regardless, there&#x27;s one thing we <i>can</i> control on an individual level: the way we view and treat the mentally ill and the homeless. Let&#x27;s not further the stigma, or wax poetic about the homeless in SF as some sort of quirky, fun landmark. I suspect that&#x27;s not the author&#x27;s intention -- he&#x27;s setting out to celebrate the homeless, not to denigrate them -- but some of his language lends itself to misinterpretation. As someone with a close friend who&#x27;s been homeless, and other friends who&#x27;ve been institutionalized, I don&#x27;t find the &quot;crazy bums&quot; characterization very constructive.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.onecpd.info/resources/documents/pit-hic_supplementalaharreport.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.onecpd.info/resources/documents/pit-hic_suppleme...</a>",1385951271

Acquisition attempts still make sense if FB sees them as complimentary products with their own potential for massive growth instead of purely defensive moves. Maybe one of the newcomers will have more luck in that space than AOL did.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s hard to elucidate what exactly will give Facebook more staying power than past attempts. Possibly simply being the first to have such a large, cross-demographic user base? I know adults of all ages who use it to keep in touch with other adults, and I also know teens who use it to keep in touch with other teens.

It&#x27;s a glimpse into the future.<p>I remember tweeting with Chris Anderson of 3D Robotics about a year ago about autonomous package delivery from A > B. I&#x27;m sure Bezos and team started nerding out on this concept years ago.<p>Eventually, &quot;vehicles&quot; the size of UPS trucks will be delivering packages autonomously all over the world. This is definitely a glimpse into that day.<p>And it won&#x27;t end at just packages, you&#x27;re going to see food, produce, perishables, medicine (bye bye pharmacy pickups) and many more products delivered to the home via drone.<p>This is without a doubt the future.<p>However, like every awesome idea it comes with a boatload of challenges that need to be addressed and I fear some will be extremely difficult if not impossible to overcome.<p>Off the top of my head, I see a few issues with Amazon Prime Air, some will be resolved, and some won&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s the beauty and uncertainty when taking on rather innovative approaches to existing problems.<p>1. The FAA situation. Drones are going to have _very_ restricted airspace especially in populated metro areas, if the FAA grants them these privileges at all. If you look at Los Angeles/SF/NYC/DC/Boston, you see airspace that is so overcrowded that I just don&#x27;t see how drones are going to be zipping around here. BUT, most US cities are urban areas, so if we lose delivery to the dense metropolis, this product could work very well. Just like you see in the video.<p>2. Aside from airspace regulations in popular cities, you have building density, apartments/condos that will make it tough to service (unless these buildings have custom built &quot;delivery stations&quot; somewhere, and that&#x27;s a cool idea). So it&#x27;s a glimpse into the replacement of the traditional mailbox. Now that&#x27;s cool.<p>3. Package weight will certainly be a concern but Prime Air will still cover an enormous amount of items from Amazon. And I believe Prime Air will allow Amazon to actually expand their product catalog with previously-undeliverable items via traditional freight (food, perishables, medicine, etc.)<p>4. Humans. Humans are always a problem. You&#x27;ll have kids/idiots trying to steal and shoot these things down. This is a minor problem that won&#x27;t necessarily end, but people will get in trouble and they&#x27;ll pay fines/etc.<p>5. Safety. Safety is important, Amazon will do whatever it can to prevent kids/adults from getting sliced by these blades but I think that this is inevitable.<p>6. Hardware failure. Sure, 4 rotors and redundancy. But we all know a few of these things are going to drop out of the sky with a box of wrenches and slam into someones car/face/house/bike/restaurant... That won&#x27;t be good. But is it even possible to ensure this doesn&#x27;t happen? Boeing airplanes fall out of the sky...<p>7. Weather. Be in no doubt these drones will drop left and right, lose course, altitude, etc. with sudden gusts of winds, environmental factors, etc. They&#x27;re getting better but it&#x27;s physics at play here.<p>All in all there are plenty of challenges to an awesome and risky endeavor.<p>What I don&#x27;t really understand is WHY. What&#x27;s the net-gain for Amazon. Will this ever fully replace UPS/USPS shipping for them? Maybe... But it will take at least 20+ years.<p>I somewhat see this as an experiment for Bezos and company. The R&D and hardware costs far exceed the pennies on the dollar they pay for UPS shipping. But it has that COOL FACTOR to it. It smells like the future. Would you pay extra for 30-minute delivery? Maybe a few times... I wonder about the utility here...",1385950549

Apply for Google in Zurich (or for that matter any other big company near Zurich with a big office in the US)<p>2. After a year transfer to the US. You get a L1 visa without a problem. There&#x27;s no limit for this type of visa like e.g. the H1B has and if you&#x27;re married your wife or husband is also allowed to work.<p>3. If you&#x27;d like to stay for longer start the greencard process as soon as you arrive in the US with the help of your company. If you&#x27;re a Swiss citizen this should take between 1-1.5 years.<p>With a master from ETH I would expect 100k+ plus equity. If it&#x27;s a later stage startup or a bigger company the base salary will be higher plus an extra bonus (stock will be on top of that). Everything else would be a weak offer and you should probably reject.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t care about housing before you have a job here. There&#x27;s no usable public transport here (Caltrain works, but only if your home and work are close enough to one of the stations and it&#x27;s also not very reliable. So not comparable to Zurich at all). If you use your car to get to work you should expect lots of traffic, so I would always prefer to be close to work. With your background you should earn enough to find something.<p>You will earn more and have less taxes in Zurich and your living standard will be higher in Switzerland. But here in Silicon Valley you will learn more and the weather is more enjoyable than in Zurich.",1385950439

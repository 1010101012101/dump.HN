9283103,comment,9282744,9282987,0,0,TheAceOfHearts,,,"1. JS has a lot of quirks, but you can find quirks in anything that has been around for a long time. From just using a linter you can avoid a TON of problems (and realistically, how many people code in any language without any kind of linting?).<p>2. I don&#x27;t know what to say about this. Maybe historically, yeah. But nowadays? You can build your API with any language or framework, and have nodejs running an isomorphic app. This means you can do server-side rendering and then delegate to the client once it loads. This provides the best possible experience. And you avoid code duplication, since you can run the almost the exact same code on the server and client. (You&#x27;ll usually have to do some minor tweaks, which I&#x27;d consider reasonable.)<p>3. From what I&#x27;ve seen, complex UI interaction are difficult to do well regardless of your environment. (This is also why I&#x27;ve been really excited about react+flux, since it provides a much better experience when developing applications.)",1427583530

Cab drivers in DF routinely don&#x27;t follow rules - they often share the same license amongst multiple people, they&#x27;ll lie about knowing how to get to a place and take you on a merry-go ride where they stop to ask people for directions along the way, they&#x27;ll go out of the way to extend your ride intentionally and cars will be completely devoid of seatbelts. The idea that Uber is line-stepping ignores the fact that everyone is already line-stepping but at least with Uber, you get a way better product.

9283083,comment,9282293,9282465,0,0,code_reuse,,,"The way I think about it is.. post graduate work.  In most of the natural sciences if you expect to be able to secure a decent job in the private sector after you complete school you need to do interesting post graduate work that is in alignment with the corporate sphere.<p>The big change we&#x27;re seeing in the IT job market is that now these same sorts of expectations which are standard in more mature job markets are now often times being applied to IT knowledge workers.  The new trend is that it&#x27;s reasonable to expect for employees to have completed significant projects which demonstrate their knowledge and competency in a non-trivial way, which is akin to a doctrinal thesis or post graduate work.<p>In my opinion what this means in practical terms is that after you finish your 4 year degree, or acquire the equivalent CS knowledge on your own, it behooves you to plan for yourself a period of time, perhaps 6 months or a year to work on actually creating something which demonstrates the knowledge that you have acquired.  You will own the IP for this &quot;field work&quot;, so you can use it to qualify yourself to future employers.<p>What I suspect is that in the future this field work will be more important than the actual 4 year degree if it&#x27;s not already.  Personally I have no experience with hiring, but since it&#x27;s part of my planning I think about it frequently. I suspect that already it&#x27;s the case that startup hiring teams get more out of examining a well built implementation of a non-trivial concept than they do out of examining a college diploma.<p>TLDR: It&#x27;s unreasonable to consider yourself to be a qualified anthropologist or an archeologist without having first done field work and documented in a thesis paper.

Here are a few quotes, first advocating for unlimited immigration, and second suggesting that there is a practically infinite supply of immigrants.<p>1. &quot;The gains to eliminating migration barriers amount to large fractions of world GDP—one or two orders of magnitude larger than the gains from dropping all remaining restrictions on international flows of goods and capital...  For the elimination of trade policy barriers and capital flow barriers, the estimated gains amount to less than a few percent of world GDP. For labor mobility barriers, the estimated gains are often in the range of 50–150 percent of world GDP.&quot;<p>2. &quot;The Gallup World Poll finds that more than 40 percent of adults in the poorest quartile of countries “would like to move permanently to another country” if they had the opportunity, including 60 percent or more of in Guyana and Sierra Leone...  The size of these constraints is apparent in the annual U.S. Diversity Visa Lottery, which allocates permanent emigration slots mainly to developing countries. In fiscal year 2010, this lottery had 13.6 million applications for 50,000 visas (U.S. Department of State, 2011)—272 applicants per slot.&quot;<p>Here is a back-of-the-envelope calculation from the paper:<p>&quot;We can check these calculations on the back of the metaphorical envelope. Divide the world into a “rich” region, where one billion people earn $30,000 per year, and a “poor” region, where six billion earn $5,000 per year. Suppose emigrants from the poor region have lower productivity, so each gains just 60 percent of the simple earnings gap upon emigrating—that is, $15,000 per year. This marginal gain shrinks as emigration proceeds, so suppose that the average gain is just $7,500 per year. If half the population of the poor region emigrates, migrants would gain $23 trillion—which is 38 percent of global GDP.&quot;<p>[1] Clemens, Michael A. 2011. &quot;Economics and Emigration: Trillion-Dollar Bills on the Sidewalk?&quot; Journal of Economic Perspectives, 25(3): 83-106.

You can use relative paths like in most places automake accepts file names. The only time I&#x27;ve run into trouble using non-recursive automake (1.13.4) is adding flex+bison source. This requires BUILT_SOURCES, which is confusing, and automake is <i>very</i> picky and non-obvious about the names of the generated source files. I think it may not have been updated to support relative paths yet? It required some heavy workarounds:<p><pre><code>    AM_YFLAGS = -d

    # this was VERY important
    # (must be abs_top_srcdir, not top_srcdir)
    foo_LFLAGS = --header-file=$(abs_top_srcdir)/src/xyzzy_lexer.h

    foo_SOURCES += src/xyzzy_lexer.l src/xyzzy_parser.y
    EXTRA_DIST  += src/xyzzy_lexer.h

    # note the inconsistency here
    BUILT_SOURCES += src/foo-xyzzy_lexer.c \
                     src/xyzzy_parser.h

    # ...and this doesn&#x27;t match BUILT_SOURCES
    MAINTAINERCLEANFILES += src/foo-xyzzy_lexer.c \

As for long-term implications, when you start to consider the impact of second-generation immigrants, the negative costs of the first-generation are balanced out.

People who are learning online are led to believe that becoming a programmer is as easy as taking a code academy course and when they finish the course, they can&#x27;t do much cause they have been gamified and handheld too much. Most of these people are giving up because there is this sharp fall from finishing an online course and becoming a &#x27;developer&#x27;.

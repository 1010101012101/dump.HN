1367731,comment,1367411,1367411,0,0,grellas,,,"I don't know about the merits of or prospects for Diaspora one way or the other but I have dealt with founders of every stripe for years and understand how people can get carried where money is involved.<p>If a nascent founder group raised $170K from hundreds or thousands of small and unsophisticated investors by traditional means (i.e., by offering them stock in the company in exchange for their small investments), and if those founders did so based on public advertising and without offering those investors any opportunity to learn the material facts about the startup's finances, product plans, founder backgrounds, etc., such an offering would be illegal, plain and simple, and every investor would have a right to get his money back not only from the company but also from each of the founders who controlled this offering. There is a valid reason why securities laws exist, and it is precisely to protect innocent investors from being induced to part with their hard-earned money based on fast and loose pitches that may or may not correlate with reality.<p>Now, I am not saying that Diaspora has done anything wrong here, or has misled those who have contributed, or any such thing.<p>My point has to do strictly with the crowdsourcing funding model as a legal tool for raising money. That model attempts to bypass the securities laws by using a donor model, and the key to its attempting to remain legal is to avoid at all costs having the contributors be characterized as ""investors."" I think that Kickstarter does this legitimately and appears therefore to be operating well within the bounds of the law.<p>But here is the Achilles heel of crowdsource funding: if the cause being supported does amount to some sort of hustle job (hypothetically speaking and not intending to impugn Diaspora), crowdsource funding enables those who might operate with less than pure motives a loophole by which they can make a mass appeal to potentially thousands of unsophisticated persons who might fund a venture without having to be accountable to those persons in any significant way. In effect, it is like an open ticket (legally speaking) to take their money and do what one will with it.<p>When there is no legal accountability ultimately for how such funds might be used, that means that the founders of a crowdsource-funded company basically are telling the public ""trust us, we're good for it,"" which may or may not bear out in reality.  This is a genetic weakness with this model of funding that is bound to lead to problems at some point down the road, however well it might play out in the Diaspora case.",1274457491

1367699,comment,1367015,1367632,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Note that I didn't list Theora. The excuses that Apple came up with actually worked with Theora, but I did list Vorbis and FLAC where it becomes obvious that they're just that ... excuses. Both have amazing hardware support and have done so for years ... in everything but iPods and Zunes. It's been pointed out before that both the Beatles and Metallica <i>sell</i> music in the FLAC format. It's not a weird freetard thing like Theora, it's the standard format for lossless music.<p>Lack of Vorbis support you can just about give a pass on since it might confuse users and spoil the Apple vibe. Not implementing FLAC in favour of your own homebrew ripoff that you don't licence out is just unforgiveable. Again, I've said before that, for me personally, was the point that Apple jumped the shark.<p>Sansa's the number two in the iPod/DMP market, one of their latest models drops AAC support, while retaining mp3, WMA, Vorbis and FLAC. If the web follows Youtube to WebM I can see similar playing out for H.264, though more realistically it's H.265 that's been strangled at birth.<p>edit: The first paragraph above may come off as too harsh on Theora, and too easy on Apple. For what it was proposed as, a baseline web format that would be guaranteed to work everywhere for your cat videos, government speeches, educational content, wikipedia footage of rare animals etc. Theora was and is perfectly suited just as gif and jpeg get the job done today despite better alternatives. It was Apple and their supporters that framed this as ""there can only be one"" codec and I guess they're reaping the whirlwind on that now.",1274457024

They find a way to go further with that short position by driving up the amount of toxic debt in the market and betting on that. There's nothing to limit the amount to which they can short the market because they've figured out how to hedge their risk and make a small profit as long as the bubble stays up. That's essentially what many of these hedge funds managed to do.<p>And of course, that's what they're paid to do - they're just good at their jobs. Which is why there's a larger issue at stake here about what constitutes ethical trading behavior in modern markets, and I think this is part of that discussion. It's completely inaccurate to say that short bets are wrong, because as you say, they are so crucial to keeping liquidity in the marketplace. At the same time, to take a position that you know for a fact will drive the bubble up to be larger, to fall harder, well - are you completely irresponsible for the consequences of those trades?<p>When you get right down to it, this is why regulation is necessary. This is why we have referees in sports - nasty behavior is encouraged and necessary in competition, so there needs to be some sort of line to say what is in and outside of the realm of acceptable behavior.

Steve Jobs did reply to someone asking him about VP8 and Jobs just linked to the x264 author's post about VP8 (<a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2010/05/21/jobs-responds-to-googles-webm-video-standard-announcement-as-patent-questions-begin-to-surface/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macrumors.com/2010/05/21/jobs-responds-to-googles...</a>).  However, I think this situation might be different.<p>MP3 and AAC had better hardware decoding support than Vorbis.  That affects Apple a lot.  Theora (to my knowledge) doesn't have chipsets made for it.  On a mobile device, you kinda need hardware decoding for both processing time and battery life.  With Google's weight behind VP8 and Vorbis, Broadcomm has committed to implementing it in their chips.  Qualcomm is also on board with WebM.  So, that might assuage Apple's concerns.<p>In terms of patents (which is one way Apple argued against Theora): I think this situation might be different as well.  First, it looks like it'll be implemented by a large number of rich companies quickly (Google, Qualcomm, AMD, Broadcom. . .).  When people pushed Apple for Theora support, who was implementing it?  Who has implemented it?  Few.  Having lots of rich companies in the same boat means more people to to defend against patent holders.  And, to be fair to Apple, I don't really know of mobile devices that have implemented Theora.  It's nice to have someone else go first and prove that it can be done.  I mean, from what I know, Android doesn't support Theora.  Anyway, with the weight and excitement, we're likely to see patents come to light, if any, sooner rather than later.<p>Plus, Google wisely put a clause in the license saying that you lose rights to their patents if you take action against anyone using WebM.  If there's enough weight behind WebM, it's going to be hard for people to pass up access to those patents.  If WebM becomes web video, you're not going to want to sue a WebM user and then potentially be permanently banned from playing in the web video game.  Think about it: 5 years down the line Qualcomm, Broadcom, and other chipset makers decide they can save a lot of money implementing WebM rather than MP3/AAC/H.264.  Most web video has gone WebM.  It's what people support.  Then someone comes along with a patent.  They're not going to want to be excluded from being able to push video to the millions of devices out there that are WebM devices.<p>But yes, I shouldn't be so confident.  I think I've made my case that Apple is <i>more likely</i> to support this than previous free stuff, but you make a good point.",1274455869

1367564,comment,1367015,1367425,0,0,mdasen,,,"So, I tend hate comments on the web because people like to ""win"" and are often disrespectful of others and I wanted to reply to you because I think you added something valuable to the thread (and that we don't acknowledge that enough online).<p>Often there are more than one ways of looking at things (see the quote in my HN profile).  Flash can totally be considered open and just no one has put the effort in like Adobe has to make a good player - and you're right that Apple could make a mostly complete Flash player if they were willing to put the effort in.  But, from my perspective, it isn't as open as I'd like.  Adobe/Macromedia did stymie alternative players for many years - even including clauses in their players EULA that you couldn't work on an alternative implementation.  Those days are gone and Adobe publishes the Flash spec (which is an awesome step that we should acknowledge no matter where we stand on the Flash debate).  However, there are always little things like RTMP which have edge cases that aren't as open.  And my personal opinion is that open technologies don't come from one company or person and can be improved by everyone.<p>Even if a technology comes from one person or company, that can be the catalyst of a broader community that works on it.  Take WebM.  Google is the company behind VP8.  However, as the WebM site says, ""A key factor in the webâ€™s success is that its core technologies such as HTML, HTTP, and TCP/IP are open for anyone to implement and improve.""  That implies that Google is expecting others to contribute and for it to become like HTML or JavaScript or Canvas.  That's exciting for me (compared to Flash where improvements just come down from on high). And, to be honest, if Adobe were totally committed to openness, they could try to get the WC3 involved in Flash.  There are standards bodies that could take over Flash or they could start a project like WebM with Google, Mozilla, and others to openly implement Flash (with H.264 and other parts as compile-time options to be included).  Yeah, it's easy for me to say that sitting here in the cheap seats, but Adobe could put in more of an effort.  Even Microsoft has been helping the Moonlight folk to implement Silverlight.<p>Flash being as open as it is, is important and I know that I've written it off a little too much in the past.  I don't want to take that away from you, Adobe, or anyone.  However, WebM looks like it'll be more open - that I could contribute (if I had the knowledge and skill).  But even not having the skill, I know that everyone from Google to Mozilla to Adobe itself can help make it awesome!  The open nature of the web has just been awesome.  It's really exciting to me in a way that Flash just isn't.  Yes, often times there's bureaucracy and it's annoying to get new things adopted and coordinated - and maybe Flash offers a nice single-source that can push the boundaries of new technologies without worrying about multiple implementations.<p>There's no reason that HTML5 video and WebM mean that Flash has to die or that it has no place on the web.  Maybe Flash can be thought of as a kind of proving ground for things that won't be implemented by multiple vendors until they've proven themselves - kinda like video (Adobe implements video, it catches on like wildfire, the W3C starts incorporating video into the HTML spec using a more community process).  I don't want to sound like an Adobe-hating person who thinks they're just evil even if I prefer HTML5 over Flash.  However, for the long term, I think that open, community involved technologies are better and the direction we should be going in rather than a single-sourced technology even if the spec is being published for it.",1274454915

This tends to mean that the bioavailability (i.e. how much you actually absorb instead of just pass through) is much better.  For example, sourcing calcium from ground up oyster shells provides plenty of the mineral, but the absorption rate is terrible.  Much research goes into finding the best bioavailable forms.<p>In general, the ingredients are significantly better quality.  Packaging B12 as cyanocobalamin may cost 1/10th as much as hydroxlcobalamin, but isn't nearly as good for us.<p>The ingredients are plentiful.  The FDA's recommended daily allowance numbers are WAY off in most cases.  For example, my multivitamin packages over 3000% of vitamin C, and over 8000% of B1.<p>Finally, a high end multivitamin includes a huge range of stuff beyond just the basics.  For example, look at the ingredients list for the LEF Mix Tabs.  It's 4 pages long in my browser.

If someone's working on the backend and returning data, make sure that the UI developer is expecting the right payload etc. A good discussion upfront instead of just coding right away will take care of that.<p>As organizer stuff you want to think about:
Make sure you have decent internet connectivity.
Power strips.
Food - pizza and redbull type stuff
Comfy furniture - I don't particularly like sitting at a desk hacking for 12+hours. I might want to sit on a couch or a beanie bag. 
Maybe music.<p>I think getting people to cover the hackathon while it's going on is also a good idea. Usually hackathons only get the spotlight when the developers emerge from the cocoon to present. I think its great when you have people from the event taking their flip cam and going around talking to hackers asking what they are doing and just to see the process.<p>As a judge I'm always more impressed when things work. I've seen entries where it's mostly a mockup or screenshots with no working tech. I've also seen working tech with no UI. Obviously the more you can show, the better.",1274454299

I can't see that many people will have the technical skill to install Diaspora.  They don't know what a server is and think that the internet is somehow magically inside their computer.  Unless Diaspora finds some way to make running the server extremely simple people won't adopt it.  Also they would have to educate their users on the basics of server operation. (Otherwise someone will start their Diaspora server, then turn the computer off and wonder why no one can see their profile.)<p>It sounds like a mess to me, and I agree that only the geekiest of people will even attempt to adopt it, and of those I wonder how many will stick with it.",1274454282

My parents were the same and they're doing just fine, so I don't think there's that much to worry about as long as you don't get deficient. There's a lot of vegetables I won't touch (but there's others I'll devour in massive quantities, so it's easier on me), but here's a tip that worked for both me and a friend, if you'd actually want a way to both eat more veg without it tasting awful: <i>Make soup!</i> I absolutely despise raw tomatoes, but cooked with thyme, basil, bay leaf, onion, garlic, pepper, and a decent amount of beef stock (or a maggi cube and water, no reason to make it too complicated) it's one of my favourite dishes. It's not even difficult to make. Same with cauliflower soup, too, or any other soup, really, vegetable or not. Having a blender does help if you don't like chunks in your soup, but otherwise you can do without. Just thought you might want to know.

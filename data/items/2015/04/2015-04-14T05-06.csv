If your wrist is already turned, or you can&#x27;t turn it (for example, because you&#x27;re typing) then you have to <i>touch</i> the face to turn it on.<p>It&#x27;s not waterproof. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s readable in very bright sunlight.<p>It&#x27;s very accurate, yes... contrary to the most expensive watches, which are the less accurate of all watches.

9372280,comment,9368682,9371884,0,0,sink,,,"Sure!<p>Mutations ARE side effects. Consider two situations with a function and a mutable variable:<p>First: Your function depends on a value that can mutate. Now you have a hidden parameter to your function. You have to test the function under all reasonable conditions by which the value can change. The function is not isolated from the rest of your program any more, and you have to check who has access to that value. That&#x27;s a lot to keep track of.<p>Second: Your function mutates a value. Now you have to keep track of everyone who references that value, and everywhere your function is invoked.<p>In both situations, the number of scenarios you must test is greatly expanded compared to when you have a &#x27;pure&#x27; function that does not operate on mutable memory.<p>Referential transparency means that for a fixed input value you can replace a function invocation with a static value. It&#x27;s just a mapping that is always the same, whether it&#x27;s computationally expensive or not. That means that you can always expect the same behavior when you compose that function. But even more important, you can assert that your function is equal to something else -- always, under all conditions.<p>This means that you can make a series of equational substitutions. And THAT means that you can use equational reasoning to prove things about your function.<p>And if your program is just a bunch of functions that are composed together, well then you can prove things about your program, too.<p>Programs are getting really complex. Really, really, really complex. Having the power to make more safe assertions about your programs is becoming more important. Being able to prove things about your programs using well known proving techniques, such as those borrowed from more formal maths like abstract algebra, is really useful.<p>You still need to test, but what you need to test becomes of much narrower scope and much less cumbersome. This is why functional programming is indeed becoming more popular.",1428989454

The ROM chip would have the same address and read control lines like any standard memory chip which could be read by setting the Address lines, the Memory Read, any additional/ancillary signaling and then reading the data lines.<p>Once you had all the bytes read, you could in principle run this through a Disassembler to get the actual Assembly language instructions (minus any original comments).

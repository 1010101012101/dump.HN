The DreamIt partners put in a lot of effort and are very well connected in the area, meaning lots of useful, targeted introductions, mentors, and speakers.  Philadelphia is also under-rated as a startup town - Philly Startup Leaders is extremely active with a wide range of entrepreneurs and there are a number of other meetups, as well.  I'm clearly biased, as it was a great experience for our startup, but I would highly recommend the program.",1281599937

He didn't intend the draft to be public as far as I know, and it's hard to back down from a public claim like this. But all the experts who have studied it believe it to be flawed; there is a wiki documenting specific problems in detail; and Terry Tao is speculating about whether it could be proven that no strategy of that general sort could possibly work.<p>It is definitely a worrying sign for Deolalikar to be standing by his work at this point. I'm not sure whether the downvotes are because you disagree with this assessment, or simply because I didn't explain myself very clearly.<p>If you look at any mathematical crank – and there are many, with varying levels of mathematical education – the basic story is always the same. It begins with an honest mistake made in good faith; what distinguishes the crank is refusal to learn from his or her mistakes.<p>I hope I'm wrong, and Deolalikar sees sense and withdraws his claim at least until he's addressed the concerns that have been raised so far.",1281599413

1597507,comment,1596607,1597461,0,0,jacobolus,,,"I agree with you that the emphasis changed dramatically from the Apple of before Jobs’ return, which had a (relatively to now) large basic R&D arm, and a vision for the future alternating between wheel-spinning and incoherence. But I don’t think the Apple of today is especially like NeXT either, probably mostly because the markets it aims for are so completely different. For example, the first iMacs and iBooks don’t seem remotely related to the NeXT design aesthetic, and IMO neither do modern iPhones or PowerBooks. Something like the iPod doesn’t seem to me to have anything to do with NeXT, in user base, in problem space, in software style, in product vision, etc.<p>You’re right that early versions of OS X looked much more like NeXTStep than they did like previous versions of Mac OS (being built on NeXT’s codebase), and still today is in many small details a regression. But as OS X has matured, it has felt ever more like ""classic"" Mac OS, not less. I think if NeXT had been independently successful and turned NeXTStep into a consumer OS, it would have evolved in a dramatically different direction (though of course that’s counterfactual).<p>I don’t really know what it was or is like to work inside these companies, but I doubt that the feel of NeXT could be quite like the feel of the modern Apple, if only because modern Apple is so much bigger.",1281599301

Ezmobius has absolutely nailed it.<p>I'm an incredible proud Dad to a fifteen week old baby boy and his advice echoes every single thing I was going to say.<p><i>Then once you go back to work expect to only work on the computer when you are at work.</i><p>I'd like to elaborate on this point. Leaving Mum & baby at home will be difficult for a while, I still struggle with it immensely but it is hugely important to remember that your job is absolutely instrumental as you are now the main breadwinner and your family is relying on you to work hard every minute you are away from them.
As hard as it may be to leave them at home, don't let it be a waste of time, make sure that you are giving 100% when you are away and please don't bring your work home with you if you can avoid it.
Whilst at work, focus on it 100%. Don't spend all day at work wishing you were at home.<p>Be prepared to argue like crazy with your other half. Regardless of how strong your bond is, you <i>will</i> fall out. Her patience with the baby may be beyond comprehension but do not expect that patience to extend to you. As stressful as it may be for you, I can guarantee it will be worse for her, infinitely worse if she's breastfeeding. Maintain perspective and learn to let everything slide.<p>Final point: Routine. Routine, routine, routine, routine.
Sleep will become a rare and priceless commodity so it is crucial that you establish a bedtime routine from the beginning.
Find a routine and stick with it. Read to your kid every single night. Even if it's just for a couple of minutes. It may seem pointless in the beginning but stick with it.
Babies bedtime is now my favourite part of the day.<p>Good luck mate. It's an incredible journey.",1281598939

Most of it comes from a push-button machine if you're lucky to get an espresso-based coffee at all. Those that are done by hand are not so great either: I've seen the same grounds be used for several coffees in a row, for example. I had to time my order so I got a fresh grind! The only good coffees (i.e. up to my Aussie standards) I've had were in Milan at a very top coffee shop and the top-of-the-range degustation restaurant in my city (in Belgium)! I've travelled a lot since I got over here too.<p>It got to the point where I decided to buy my own machine. But the ones you can buy in shops here for reasonable amounts are all the push-button stuff with substandard heaters etc. So I asked my boyfriend to bring one over from Sydney (just a cheapie Sunbeam one with a boiler) when he came to visit, and since then (and after acquiring a very expensive grinder locally) I've managed to make decent coffees. So much so that my local friends/colleagues continually ask me when I will be inviting them around for coffee next. I even had a bunch of Italian colleagues tell me that it was one of the best espressos they'd had. And I'm not a fully trained barista either, I just learned from my dad :)<p>Really though it makes me sad that I've had this experience, but it means I can really see the potential for good quality coffee making over here.",1281597715

I couldn't get any work done because of the sleep dep.<p>My one biggest piece of advice.  SLEEP WHEN THE BABY SLEEPS. or you will get <i>NO</i> sleep ever.<p>It will be the roughest thing you have ever gone through but one smile from your childs face up at yours makes it all better and reinvigorates you for another shot of energy for whatever you need to do.<p>Trust me though you will need to take at least 4 weeks off work for paternity leave assuming you are the father. Then once you go back to work expect to only work on the computer when you are at work. When you  get home expect your wife to want some help with the kid and dinner etc. and don't expect to get any computer time at night for the first 3-4 months.<p>You will only get computer work done at work when you are away from the house and at the office. When you are at home your wife will have a constant stream of little things she will want you to do and you will feel like a slave, but then you will imagine what she goes through being alone with the baby <i>all</i> the time. and you will have mad respect for her.<p>Mostly try to be supportive and learn to not mumble under your breath when she asks you to do a million little things, Just do them and move along. It will pass soon once the baby hits 6 months or so and starts to have a real personality that you can interact with.<p>The first 4 months out of the womb is considered the 4th trimester and the kid is really still a foetus. Literally they cannot do anything for themselves until about 4 months. So its all up to you ad your spouse to do everything for them. They will be all floppy for a while not even able to hold their head up without support.<p>Trust me though it will all be worth it every time your little one smiles in your face and you will be re-invigorated.<p>Its the most incredible thing that has every happened to me and it made me re-evaluate my life and make major changes(like <i>major</i> changes). I resigned from my startup that I founded after 4 years(engine yard: really long story i'll write a book about someday ;)) to make sure i could spend this time with my son as much as possible. I cannot say what I am doing next but I am moving to Portland where my folks live in order for my son Ryland to be closer to his grandparents. And got a job that was understanding about working remote and weird hours. My new boss is the coolest ever he literally said ""As long as you shit good code I don't care where your toilet is""  :P<p>Don't worry, it will come naturally to you like it has to all humans thhroughout time. But remember this<p>SLEEP WHEN THE BABY SLEEPS DURING THE FIRST 4 MONTHS<p>good luck! and congratulations!",1281596400

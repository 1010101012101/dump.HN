Because being treated as native apps gives them additional flexibility.  With browsers able to ""install"" web apps, they can provide additional functionality to these applications that otherwise couldn't exist.<p>> With bookmarking them and making the app use HTML5 app cache.<p>Yes.

Having a trusted app store where you can get your apps.
2. Allow for an easy system to setup and sell your app.  Envato does this.  Apple does this.  MS is planning on doing this.  Google does this.  You also make the assumption that developers can easily accept payments.  It's not that easy, unless you bow to the will of PayPal.
3. Mozilla not doing this would leave it behind.  Suddenly, if people wanted to use these web apps, they'd have to switch off Firefox.<p>I've presented many reasons why this is a good thing.

But why haven't there been any huge new successes in the last decade or so ?<p>I can think of a few (over-generalized) reasons:<p>- over-emphasis on banking and finance. The City is where the big money was made, and is disproportionately important to the UK economy (even now) so that's where the polymaths -our homegrown Zuckerbergs and Brins and Gates - went to make their fortune.<p>- class system. Business and government leadership comes from a very narrow circle of ex-public school and/or Oxbridge graduates who share a common disdain for science and technology. Time and again scientists and engineers have left for the US and elsewhere because they couldn't get funding at home - businessmen and politicians simply didn't ""get"" the potential of research.<p>- over-centralization. If you think Hacker News is bad with its Silicon Valley-centric worldview, come to the UK. If it's not happening in London, it's not happening. London however is a horribly expensive place to live, pushing up salaries, office costs, etc - not the ideal place for a startup. Start your business in the ""provinces"" however and nobody will notice you.<p>- bureaucracy. Both UK and EU legislation have increased the amount of paperwork needed to get started - for example employment legislation. Not sure how this compares to the US (which varies state to state) but it hasn't helped.",1287576225

When I was developing games 10-12 years ago there was a staggering array of different displays, processor speeds, internet connection speeds, colour depths etc etc, whereas now on pretty much any PC you'll have true colour, decent display, decent connection etc. I suspect that game developers still have to wrestle with capability differences more than the rest of us, but for ""normal"" applications any PC is good enough these days. Windows and the related drivers are also much more stable and consistent now. I don't think Android is there yet, but I suppose it will be within a couple of years.<p>Disclaimer: I've never written an Android app.",1287576072

When you're teaching people Ruby on Rails you would/should be teaching them what exists in the framework by default. The default templating language for views happens to be ERB-powered HTML, and so that should be taught.<p>Teaching haml and Rails at the same time would only confuse people as they will need to learn Rails AND haml at the same time. If anything, it would be better to introduce this as a ""bonus chapter"" or an appendix and let people choose for themselves rather than forcing them to learn something excessive.<p>Now, you may think that I would argue the same point for SCSS too.

2963304,comment,2962735,2963127,1,0,jjmaxwell4,,,"> Living vicariously is the essence of being human.<p>I think this is the exact point the author is trying to disprove. The articles isn't saying that all viewing activities are bad, in fact he point out the ""high-horse-ness"" of people who say they are. Instead he is saying that the essence of being human is in being in the area, not passively viewing it.<p>While there is much to learn from watching, reading, ect, real life takes place when you are the doer, not the viewer.   Teddy Roosevelt's very famous ""It's not the critic that counts"" speech (Full Version: <a href=""http://www.leadershipnow.com/tr-citizenship.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leadershipnow.com/tr-citizenship.html</a> ) comes to mind instantly.<p>While History is the study of things that you will never be able to do, it is immensely valuable, if that knowledge can be translated into ideas about what we should do. Winston Churchill was a student of history, and his life was meaningful because he acted on this knowledge to stop the German advance and save the free world.<p>You are right about the fisherman-soldier analogy. But I think the article's main point is that creators (read doers) are of much more value to society then consumers (read viewers).<p>This is why we should have ""One thing in which [we are] a doer, and not just a viewer.""",1315255585

2963301,comment,2962255,2963252,3,0,fabiandesimone,,,"That's very interesting. In Venezuela there is a controlled currency market meaning that is illegal to trade in foreign currency without the approval of the local government.<p>Right now Venezuelan have the following impositions:<p>You get a maximum of 5000 dollars a year for travel. Is not 5K for every travel you make, is 5K for all the trips you might take on a given year.<p>Not only that you don't get them all at once: you must report were you are going to and they have a table of predefined amounts for each destination. For example:<p>If you go to the USA, you get something like 50 dollars a day. This mean that if you go 30 days, they (the government) will approve you 1500$.<p>These 1500$ of course comes with some restrictions: you can only use them in the country you said you were going to. This means that if I happen to take a small trip to Toronto, I can't spend any of that money. If I do there are serious consequences (penalties)<p>On the Internet side of things, you get 400$ a year for Internet purchases.<p>When I say get, I mean you are allowed to buy that amount of dollars at the set market price of 4.3 Bolivares per dollar. This price is set by the government.<p>At this point it should be pretty obvious to anyone reading this that all these impositions have create a secondary market (which by law, as a Venezuelan, I can't talk about it) But let's say the price of the dollar is quite high.<p>How is any of this related to Netflix?<p>Netflix is going to charge in Bolivares. Then they will need to go to the government to ask permission to change those Bolivares at the current set market rate. The main issue here is that most likely the government won't be giving them the needed currency (not necessarily because they don't want to, but because they don't have enough cash to do it).<p>What happens then: Netflix will be full of Bolivares, that are subject to a 30% inflation a year. So they would inevitably need to go to the secondary market to change those Bolivares to Dollars.<p>This has its consequences: they would get about half of what they would if the government granted them the requested currency and second, trading in the secondary market is highly illegal these days with some serious jail time.<p>So, Netflix in Venezuela, to me seems like an strategic move to cover the region, but business wise I don't see it lasting long if the current limitations stay.<p>Other than that, I think is great they are investing in Venezuela :)",1315255531

2963265,comment,2962878,2962878,4,0,muhfuhkuh,,,"""Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity""<p>My pet theory corollary to this (and one that I think has become increasingly prevalent in the age of anti-elitism and -intellectualism) can be described as ""never attribute to human achievement that which can be explained by religious miracle"".<p>It's gotten so prevalent, in fact, that Apple uses it in it's modern marketing campaigns. The idea that a consumer electronic device can be ""magical"" is a nauseating reminder once again that, because of globalization and layers of both self-imposed and corporate-sponsored abstraction/obfuscation, we no longer know how even the most basic concepts operate or what things we consume are made of.<p>It's gotten to the point where we openly <i>discourage</i> tinkering. For example: What once was a proud young hacker's rite of passage going to Radio Shack and buying a breadboard to make LEDs shine and motors whir, is nowadays seen with derision or as malicious alchemy (""he's a terrorist building some kinda bomb or sumthin'"", et al.).<p>And, it's not even about education, though in many cases you'd think it were. When a doctor has slaved away for years in academia, plied his trade in residency, done fellowships and participated in research for novel procedures and drug discoveries, their saving of a patient's life is more likely than not attributed by the patient to God than their exhaustive efforts. Ditto, any economic downturn/upturn, droughts <i>and</i> bumper crop seasons, etc.<p>Most people don't know who Norman Borlaug is, but they sure know who made their drought- and pest-resistant, season and climate-independent, abundant and hearty sandwich bread be so cheap and taste so good: God.<p>In politics, one need not look further than the Tea Party to see that this ""magical"" thinking is rife in political discourse, with so many clinging on to America's ""manifest destiny"" and ""American exceptionalism"" as the answer to both why we got to where we are and where we need to go. Nevermind that most of our ""exceptionalism"" stemmed from the fact that we were the only industrialized country left standing after WWII and had factories ready to serve the world. Now that we have no war? It's the illegal invader's from Mexico's fault we're going downhill, which isn't even  Occam's razor ""a => b"" thinking, just simpleminded bigotry.",1315254838

Given a set of constraints, people will optimize for the best personal outcome.<p>In doing so they did break a number of laws, isn't that ""cheating""?<p>But despite the technicalities, the point of it is that any adult could look at the results of their actions and decide that because they would produce negative outcomes for society that they should stop doing them, regardless of laws.<p>If these were Montana hermits hiding from civilization I'd cut them a break but these are giant institutions demanding not only legal protection from people trying to reclaim their funds, but bailouts as they hold our economy hostage.<p>> With that said, whose dishonesty is responsible for the housing collapse:
> * Were the homeowners dishonest for taking on loans they could not afford to pay back?
> * Were the lenders and real estate agents dishonest for making the loans to the home owners?
> * Were the finance guys responsible for thinking that risk could be mitigated using the tools of finance?
> * Were the investors being dishonest for cheering on returns that were above market-average without considering the risk?<p>Yes.<p>But the bankers who saw the big-picture were more dishonest and more responsible than the mortgage pushers and the investors who both should have known it was too good to be true, and all of them more responsible than the consumers who we don't actually expect to be actuarial experts, who did what their bank and society were encouraging them to do.<p>But yes, to the degree that they couldn't read that fine-print and educate themselves appropriately, then lobby to change things, they are ultimately responsible as they are where the government derives its mandate - to the degree that it does.<p>> Painting a market with the brushes of corruption and dishonesty does very little to advance an understanding of how the event happened and what can be done to prevent it in the future.<p>The reality is corruption and dishonesty, painting that picture is the only reasonable thing. Yes, we do need to understand that humanity is rife with the willingness to lie for gain, but we don't have to embrace it and treat it as okay just because it's normal.<p>""Normal"" in that context is a branch up-side the head and the other guy is ""right"". But we strive for more than that, and need to be held accountable when we hurt others by failing.<p>We need reality-based finance, which assumes every other player is Mallory or Eve. Like with security.<p>> Goldman Sachs hires a lot of economists and finance guys, and they hire the people with the best resumes. One should hardly scream conspiracy if it turns out that some of these ""cream of the crop"" individuals end up working in the treasury. Statistically, the probability of it happening randomly is actually quite high.<p>Not at all. You approach it like working for or against corruption is the flip of a coin. Most people who'd go into regulatory agencies for reasons the public would approve wouldn't be interested in an industry job after. The fact that there's such a crossover only goes to show the positions are being held by amoral defectors.",1315254534

It's rarer to hear people try to make fun of Americans for not playing basketball or, god help us, golf... because in any city in America a golf course or a pickup basketball game is probably no more than ten minutes away. I know a bunch of middle-aged adults who play basketball. I know this because they occasionally turn up with basketball injuries. ;)<p>Incidentally, I only just noticed an incredible folly at the heart of this article: If you sample teenagers, you'll find a much larger percentage of them playing sports. But a smaller and smaller percentage of the American population is under 25. Is it really such a terrible thing that so few 55-year-olds play contact sports? Aren't our emergency rooms busy enough as it is?",1315253222

It is not quite the same as ""unintelligent"", and it is sufficiently well-defined that it is no longer merely an insult, either.)<p>Amusing, but less insightful than ""The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity"". While it is true that you can construct cases where two stupid people may ruin one smart one's day while coming out with a net win for one or both of them, you have to go farther and show that this case <i>dominates</i>. I would submit that it in fact does not, and stupid people will still tend to harm themselves more than anyone around them, if for no other reason than that is the easiest outcome for them to obtain. I do not thing there is a great benefit in running in a great herd of people who are constantly causing the herd a net harm (by definition of stupid), and the herds in this case would tend to eliminate themselves.<p>I think it is sufficient to observe merely that being smart is <i>hard</i>. In the great space of all actions one may take, the vast bulk of them are bad actions that will cause harm. Rather than complicated and IMHO probably false theories about how stupid people can win in herds, somehow converting their huge set of transactions each of which is a net harm into some sort of benefit, one need merely point out that as more people become intelligent, it actually raises the bar for <i>further</i> intelligent actions. The low-hanging fruit has been plucked. For example, some people who were very well adapted for producing net value in the 20th century find it much more difficult in the 21st because we've successfully captured so much value already.<p>(Also the article falls prey a bit to the idea that a carefully constructed game play strategy can fall to a player who acts stupidly. While, again, you can construct scenarios in which this is true as was done in the article, it is the exception. In general good gameplay strategies do not fall apart when presented with a stupid opponent, they win swiftly. If you really believe this is a general property of game strategies, I invite you to download any competent chess playing program and attack it with a ""random"" move strategy. It is true that you may force it off the opening book relatively early, but it will still efficiently tear you apart, not react with the AI-equivalent of stunned confusion. This is a sort of low-grade AI/game theory urban legend.)",1315253143

That may not seem important but a first impression like that nearly made me skip this post entirely when the only cost involved was reading it.<p>My suggestions:<p>1. Make the website look prettier. If you google for ""free css templates"" there's a site that has hundreds of them with the only requirement that you link back. They come with pre-made HTML that you just chop around as you see fit. Just looking a little different from the bland defaults stands for a lot.<p>2. Reorganise your visual hierarchy[1]. Your main page makes my eyes bounce all around the place because the different elements are fighting with each other for attention. MATHS JAM! SIGN UP! LOG IN! NEWS! - it can't all be important at once. If you look at something like the Business of Software front page[2], the order of importance is clearly name > when & where > price > register button > description. Different priorities are okay, but it's important to understand visual priority is a ratio, not a sum - adding 10 to everything leaves the values unchanged.<p>3. Multimedia = social proof. Back to the Business of Software page, there's a video halfway down that gives you a description of the conference. Why do that when it's already written out in more efficient text that you don't have to click anything to read? It's because you get to see all those beautiful panning shots of the crowd, and earnest people (just like you!) talking about how excited they are to be at the conference. Words are good at conveying facts, but if you want to convey an experience it's got to be pictures and video. If you have pictures of the last MathsJam, they should be sitting right on that front page. If not, it's worth making happen for next time. You want an image that says ""we're having a fantastic time, just like you will"".<p>There's some other stuff, but I hope that helps a bit. Again, I'm not criticising to be snarky. I think what you're doing is great and I'd rather see it have a good website than a bad one.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/visual-hierarchy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/visual-hierarchy/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://businessofsoftware.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://businessofsoftware.org/</a>",1315252975

Google Reader is the best in a sorry lot, but mainly because Google sports an inherent advantage (even in the foolhardy sense they’ve implemented it thus far) with its ominous search capability. Read and unread item counts matter not a scintilla to me, as I care just for nimbleness in scanning “what’s new” in the subject matters of my choosing in a chronological manner.<p>I enjoy reading RSS on Google Reader. It has totally supplanted the time I used to allot to “reading the newspaper”. I know I’ve shared this before, but I keep pace with 2,600 subscriptions. No, I certainly do not read every item and probably only click through less than 10-20% of items. Not true for all sites, as the frequently updated sites get clicked at a 2-3% rate whereas treasured, infrequently updated sites have all their items read. But I don’t fret over unread items and even if I miss reading for a day or two, I feel no obligation to “catch up”, and instead, if I want to review items of interest I may have missed, I use the “Search” feature.<p>Oh, additionally, all of the mobile and/or tablet RSS reader applications are colossal failures, except for maybe Flipboard, which comes at RSS in a different tact, mainly via Twitter. The whole point of RSS is accelerating the pace at which web content is perused. Doing RSS with a subscription set count of less than a hundred is not much of an efficiency improvement. And the mobile and/or tablet offerings simply choke and sputter on a larger dataset (unless there are new, or updated, offerings I am unaware of). Also, Google Reader (as well as all the Google web products) suck massively on the mobile platforms — it’s why my iPad mostly collects dust and the MacBook Air (using Chrome/Chromium in full screen mode) shines — for the superior Google Reader experience.",1315252853

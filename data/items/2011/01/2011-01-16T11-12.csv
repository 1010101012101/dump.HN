This is a polite way of saying ""you're an outlier, you're not our target user, please go away and stop bothering us"".<p>""<i>People seem to hate AIR. Wherever you see AIR apps, there are support forum threads opened by customers begging for a native alternative</i>""<p>I've personally never noticed this, got any examples?<p>Let me say here: I'm not a fan of AIR - I'm completely indifferent to it as a technolgoy - but so far you're just bitching about your personal experiences with one application and wishing the world were different from how it is so you'd find it more enjoyable.<p>""<i>a moderator sheepishly explaining that they just don’t “have the time” </i>""<p>What's to be sheepish about!? There's no shame in not having the time to build native apps for every platform. I don't have the time to write all of my code in assembly so I use high level languages. If you tried to run a modern operating system on 1980s hardware you wouldn't get particularly far. Technologies are built and adopted to improve productivity and get products to market faster - AIR is one of these. Whether or not it is the best choice for one application or another, or whether you happen to enjoy it or not has no bearing on how much actual time a company or individual has to develop software! They make a choice about a technology based on their goals and the information at their disposal. Why should they be feeling sheepish?<p>""<i>The fact that some subset of users are willing to shell out for these native apps should be a wake-up call. That’s money that those service providers are letting slip away.</i>""<p>No, it's money they're <i>making</i> by opening their product using an API and not trying to be all things to all people. By allowing 3rd party developers to build on their platform they still get your money, but they just don't have to do any extra work for it building a native app for your platform.<p>""<i>In a nutshell, what you’re communicating with an AIR app is that your business priorities (saving time and money) are more important than what your customers want.</i>""<p>Or maybe you're just trying to build a minimum value proposition, make some money, test the market, receive feedback, learn something, iterate and improve. You seem to think these guys are dishing up an AIR application in an afternoon then taking your hard earned cash and throwing it onto a gigantic ""Scrooge McDuck"" style money bin, then taking the yacht out for an afternoon spin to laugh at their sucker customers. You don't like the product, don't bloody buy it! That's what the free market is there for.<p>""<i>“We don’t have time” is the common excuse for delivering an AIR app instead of a good native app. Money, though, can buy someone else’s time. For a price, you can find a great contractor to build a native app for any platform under the sun.</i>""<p>Okay then why don't <i>you</i> build this app that you're after? Just learn to program, then build it yourself. Oh, don't have time? Well just pay someone else to do it for you. If you have the money, fantastic, compete and make a better product. What makes you think that these people are any different from you? That they don't exist in the same world of limitations and constraints that we all do every single day of our lives?<p>""<i>Humans are gifted with extremely sensitive bullshit detectors.</i>""<p>Yeah mine started going fucking bonkers about paragraph 2 ...<p>You could have made this article about how flawed you think AIR is as a technology, cited examples of applications that have vocal user communities looking for a native app etc.<p>Instead you've just made outlandish claims that people building technology and working to create products are <i>lazy</i>, that they're somehow compelled to produce mediocre products (rather than settling for the best they can afford to produce and shipping <i>something</i> in the hopes that some people will get good use out of it).<p>Software is a constant process of settling for mediocrity. Nothing is ever <i>finished</i>. No software developer has ever typed one last semi-colon, sit back and said ""you know what? There's nothing else I'd add to that, it's perfect"".<p>Who keeps upvoting this!?",1295178852

2109175,comment,2107773,2108343,0,0,chipsy,,,"But here's the thing: Who is pushing the idea that people want the God of War cow? Are players really asking for that, or is it a fantasy on the part of publishers?<p>Publishers definitely like the idea of pumping up their games with unnecessarily large budgets, even though it works against them on a risk/reward basis, because, at least in theory, throwing money into a game will lead to a work of higher quality than the competition. And internally, everyone in charge of such projects can fall back on the prestige and instant attention assumed from having such an obviously detailed, polished work.<p>And yet Nintendo has never felt much need to compete on that level. They give their games plenty of marketing, for sure, but product development stays pretty tight. As far as the public knows, they never let a product explode into a monumental 4-year effort. But their games are still good and still attract a sizable audience, and they've had the most success of the big publishers in substantially expanding the game market.<p>Comparing the two approaches, I take the opinion that most of the console publishers are overextending themselves with an outdated strategy. It was more compelling to try to push the budget upwards in past eras, where the technology was just barely making new things possible each time, and the market was full of early-adopter types who wanted to see the shiniest thing around. But the differences between the best-looking games of 2011 and the best-looking games of 2006 are pretty subtle to the uninitiated viewer, nothing like the gap between any previous five-year comparison. And the overall trend of gaming has been towards more accessibility and less (overt) complexity. So our notions of quality have to change with it, and that greatly upsets the balance of power in game development.",1295176149

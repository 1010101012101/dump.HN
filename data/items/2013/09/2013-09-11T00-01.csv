Consider the way Debian (and many others) approach the problem. Almost all software is installed through the package manager, which gets the software from a set of repositories. These repositories can be as much of a walled garden as the repository owners want them to be. 
The main difference is that, it is possible to add third party repositories, and/or remove first party repositories (or sidestep the package manager entirely).",1378860565

6364724,comment,6359719,6359959,4,0,kens,,,"I&#x27;ve been reverse-engineering old microprocessors lately (e.g. Z-80), and I&#x27;ve been thinking about this question. For chips of that era, you can actually look at the silicon, examine what it does, and be pretty confident that there&#x27;s no back door. (Although interestingly the Z-80 is said to have a few &quot;traps&quot; to prevent copying, where due to silicon doping tricks the circuit doesn&#x27;t do what it looks like visually. But scanning capacitance microscopy would catch this.)<p>But for a modern microprocessor, it&#x27;s impractical to reverse-engineer the chip at this level. One solution would be the manufacturer could publish the full plans and circuitry for the chip, which would make it easier to see if everything looks okay in the circuit, and then you could verify that what&#x27;s on the chip matches the plans. For instance, if Intel published the circuitry for their digital random number generator, you could look at the circuitry, look at the chip, and be pretty confident that everything is okay. (Note that this could be published without being open-sourced. In a perfect world, patents would include all this information.)<p>The problem is for chips that have microcode that can be updated, knowing the chip itself is &quot;correct&quot; doesn&#x27;t help you, since the microcode could be malicious. Even if the random number generator is valid, the microcode could modify the values before you get them. My conclusion is that even if your chip is 100% validated, it doesn&#x27;t help you at all if you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in the microcode.<p>(This all depends on what kind of attack is being put into the chip, of course. I wouldn&#x27;t notice any side-channel attacks built into the Z-80 such as timing-based attacks or power consumption. You could probably sneak in something super-obscure like the carry flag not getting cleared in some corner case and make it non-obvious, but that would be pretty hard to exploit.)",1378860511

I have lots of personal experience with this, and if a photographer registers his or her copyright, such companies are very much liable for compensating the artist.  These companies know this.  Most photographers don&#x27;t notice the infringements or if they do haven&#x27;t registered their images.  If more photographers registered, the pool of stolen images would be full of many more legal torpedoes, so to speak, and the companies who are less risk averse would spend the 30 minutes it would take to brainstorm a system for getting images legitimately.

The Russians nicely enough told us that

that the Russians gave us.  Net,
the NSA electronic data is just not
very effective against such a wacko;
our police departments aren&#x27;t either.<p>Maybe the hope of the NSA is catching
another UBL planning another 9/11
and do so by grabbing cell phone data.
Well, the terrorists know now to assume
that telephones and e-mail are not
secure; knowing that, the NSA will
be even more useless than now.<p>The NSA is just a bureaucracy gone
totally out of control because no
one with authority wants to say &quot;Stop&quot; and then
risk being blamed the next time
something goes &quot;Boom!&quot;.  Any

That makes it more confusing, as it really is defining a standard interface for exposing and establishing Webhooks--i.e. pretty much a spec. So, when I read that it&#x27;s not a spec, it made me question for a second whether I truly understood it.<p>I also agree with a previous commenter who said it&#x27;s unclear what you guys&#x27; role is. Are you just defining this &quot;spec&quot; to help the world, and hoping that the world gets on board? Or, are you offering some sort of service? Also, how would a dev just start using these, when it requires that the services they are consuming &quot;speak Rest Hook?&quot;. It just seems like a good idea, but not immediately useful. If there was a simple call to action that said, &quot;Hey devs, let&#x27;s all use these when building services&quot;, then the pitch would be more understandable (assuming that&#x27;s what you guys are promoting).<p>BTW, I do think it&#x27;s a worthwhile idea. Personally, I&#x27;ve found Webhooks to be very simple, thus I&#x27;m not really sold on the &quot;research&quot; that indicates devs struggle with them more than they would Resthooks.

These kinds of &quot;quick reference&quot; techniques are great once you know the language and need information quick, but it&#x27;s just proof that the docs are unapproachable to a new programmer if they have to resort to non-standard operations like the above to figure out what&#x27;s going on.",1378857928

6364499,comment,6364141,6364417,1,0,vacri,,,"I think the GP has a fair question - the stereotype of people who label themselves &#x27;Reverend&#x27; includes a considered reluctance to use profanity. It&#x27;s not saying that reverends can&#x27;t do this if they&#x27;re &#x27;real&#x27;, but it is far enough out of the stereotype to ask just what kind of denomination is the author a reverend for?<p>Whether or not it&#x27;s &quot;written&quot; somewhere doesn&#x27;t mean that there isn&#x27;t a stereotype as to how &#x27;holy&#x27; men (it&#x27;s always men...) should behave. Witness the confusion when Westerners got into Indian religions in a big way, then couldn&#x27;t quite square the way some gurus shagged themselves silly - &#x27;holy&#x27; men were &#x27;supposed&#x27; to be celibate, if not in actuality, then at least in behaviour. It isn&#x27;t the done thing to have your Anglican priest bragging about his last shagging session with his wife, for example.<p>Or is the author using &#x27;reverend&#x27; as a joke appellation, without seriously being one?",1378857925

NFC is more in the category of RFID.<p>Secondly, NFC tags are unpowered and rely on the reader for energy.  They store several dozen bytes up to several thousand bytes and are useful for QR-style applications, like &quot;Tap here for our address&quot; and so forth.  I did up some business cards with tappable tags on the back that take a device to my website.  They also make tags fully embedded in paper and cardboard for cosmetic appeal.<p>NFC tags are very cheap, on the order of a few cents each up to a dollar each, and are therefore well suited to the smart objects applications such as, for example, tapping a pill bottle to retrieve non-trivial amounts of information about the medicine, or storing identity information on personal possessions.<p>Really, the applications are endless.  I think Apple has missed the ball on this one.  They should have included NFC early on.  You can buy an iPhone case with NFC, which is useful but of course it&#x27;s never as good as having it built in.<p>(Interestingly, the linked article is on TechCrunch, a news website that recently published an article &quot;NFC = No One F<i></i>king Cares!&quot;.  Of course, the author, a journalist apparently with no engineering background, drew a lot of caustic comments for that one, and subsequently I stopped reading that publication.  This iPhone 5 article is poorly edited; it&#x27;s too bad this out of probably dozens of choices is the one that made it into YC.)",1378857830

God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this
day: 29:13 That he may establish thee to day for a people unto
himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto
thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and
to Jacob.<p>29:14 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;
29:15 But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD
our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day: 29:16
(For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came
through the nations which ye passed by; 29:17 And ye have seen their
abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which
were among them:) 29:18 Lest there should be among you man, or woman,
or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD
our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should
be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood; 29:19 And it come
to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless
himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the
imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst: 29:20 The
LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his
jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are
written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out
his name from under heaven.<p>29:21 And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes
of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are
written in this book of the law: 29:22 So that the generation to come
of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that
shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of
that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it; 29:23
And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning,
that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like
the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the
LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: 29:24 Even all nations
shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what
meaneth the heat of this great anger?  29:25 Then men shall say,
Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their
fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the
land of Egypt: 29:26 For they went and served other gods, and
worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given
unto them: 29:27 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this
land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:
29:28 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in
wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as
it is this day.",1378857819

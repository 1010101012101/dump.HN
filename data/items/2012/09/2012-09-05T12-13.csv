4479109,comment,4478817,4479058,0,0,jamiecurle,,,"You're right, it is a whack-a-mole situation, which is why I'd move more towards a browser and user level solution. The OP made a fine suggestion that bridges responsibility between user, website owner and browser<p>> The gist would be using a rel element like so:
<a href='privacy.html' rel='privacypolicy'>Privacy</a>
and then using that as a means of consistently linking to a privacy policy. As a result, policies would have consistent language for users ('look for the ""Privacy"" link') but could also be detected automatically by browsers or testing tools.
That way you could actually test your site is properly linking to a policy, and users could have browser preferences like ""disable cookies until I've seen a policy"" or whatever.<p>[edited for clarity]",1346849965

1. Because of the giant ad right beneath the text box, it took me visiting the site twice to see that there was actually content below the fold.<p>2. The lack of the submit button gave me a pause until I hit enter.  For a great deal of my friends this will be a killer issue as they generally don't browse through the use of the enter/return key.<p>3. Give the number of followers you have on twitter, you should put a ""tweet this"" button next to the results with a link back to your website or at least cc:ing your twitter account.<p>4. The ad though big and re-loaded everytime the page is used, could probably be better used if it was to the right or the left.  As you are using bootstrap, maybe span7 for the main content and span5 for the ad?  That way I don't have to scroll, and the translated phrases don't get lost?<p>5. As a final thing, it would be great to see what other phrases people had tried to translate.  I tried a few funny movie quotes to see what the came back with and thought to myself that it would be funny to see what other things people were putting into the translator.<p>6. If you really wanted to go really far and funny, try incorporating something like quickmeme.com into it.

I got more general life lessons out of it.<p>You learn to take decisions with vague information by approximating and using basic math. As TomGullen says, the necessary math is neither hard nor is it much. To art is to adapt your numbers to the real world situation. Example: With an open-ended straight draw at the flop, you chances are roughly 1/3 for a straight in the end. First, you need at least two other players. If you have one other player, you fold, because it is not profitable. With three or more other players you keep playing. With two enemies it gets interesting, because you need to factor more information in, to decide. What is your position? Did someone raise before the flop? How did your two enemies play their hands before? What is your image at the table? ...<p>Another lesson i got from poker is to control my emotions when I'm on a streak. If you are on a winning streak, you still must fold when the math says the expected value is negative. On a loosing streak you still must go all-in if the math says so. No peaking at the flop, when your initial hand is too bad.",1346848024

As for the timer, I don't see how you could guarantee the frequency in a javascript VM. It could be similar (by continually testing how inaccurate it is and adjusting the frequency of subsequent iterations), granted, but this is not accuracy (it is emulation). As for memory, etc, many of these older games had ""death screens"" where a buffer overflows and simple crashes the game, preventing you from continuing past a certain point - that too would be very difficult to accurately model in javascript.

I notice may body gets accustomed to that schedule. I get tired at the right time, and wake up at the right time.<p>- I stopped reading news sites (including Hacker News) after 21:00. They get me exited and put my mind into overdrive.<p>- I stopped using a computer or mobile phone after 22:00. Lots of research has shown that prolonged screen use reduces melatolin production.<p>- End the day with some simple activity that is only mildly interesting. E.g., if you are not too much into sports, watch some boring sports on television.<p>- Have some melatolin tablets at home, just in case you have some really bad nights. It's said that they do very little harm.<p>- Have a second place in your house to sleep (e.g. a couch) if you have a partner. You can avoid keeping him/her awake as well.<p>- Stop worrying about sleep. It's hard, but it helps.<p>Since I made these changes, I sleep well 95% of the time. The other 5% I still sleep enough ours to make it through the day.<p>With respect to the Scotch, as much as I like Scotch, I would avoid it. It helps some, but it can quickly turn into an addiction.",1346847792

4478959,comment,4478758,4478758,6,0,OafTobark,,,"The following responses are base solely on my experience so please don't take it as the norm as I have no other comparisons to go off of...<p>1. Most people in the tech/startup scene will congratulate you. Most people outside of the above will ask why you sold your company. The reason for asking probably varies. I didn't expect that. It was weird at first to have many of my non-tech/non-business friends ask that question, whether it was people I was close to or random folks I haven't talked to in awhile. I suspect many are just genuinely curious why anyone would ever sell their company (maybe its not considered a norm).<p>2. Right after the sale, there was a transition period with the parent company and the team would go on to work for the new owners. That didn't quite pan out for our founding team, myself included. I left after a few months. From there, I went traveling for 6-7 months just to travel and enjoy life a little bit. The grind during the startup consumed a large portion (read: all of it) my life and I wanted to just relax for a little bit.<p>I thought traveling was the thing I wanted to do. And then it wasn't. Like a kid excited about a new video game, the excitement wears off and eventually you don't care. After 6-7 months, I didn't care for traveling anymore either. Doing the startup had changed me (for better or for worse) and I wanted to work on something else.<p>3. I didn't know if I wanted to do another startup, a project, or whatevers. I just knew I wanted to work on something else. This proved insanely difficult. While we were grinding on our startup, coming up with new roadmaps and new ideas were a cinch, there was always ways to expand on things. Going back to scratch, with a world of knowledge I didn't have prior to the first startup made things incredibly difficult. You start to dissect everything and half the ideas I wouldn't have thought twice about in the past, I now wouldn't want to do simply because I know a lot more and have a strong disinterest in certain ideas, didn't want to deal with certain aspects of an idea, or just simply didn't see a viable growth for such an idea.<p>It took quite awhile to even just come up with any idea (business or not) that I wanted to solve for myself, if nothing else. There was a moment where everything just came to a complete halt because I was in this weird limbo stage where I was extremely picky about ideas or just had no interest in anything. Following up on HN or any tech news was more entertaining than helpful if anything. Ultimately it just took a lot of time away from all this stuff before ideas started to flow again (ideas that mattered). In time, I had more ideas than I could keep up with, but it took awhile to get there (about a year).<p>4. How it changed my life. The learning experience from start to finish is impossible to measure. And I don't just mean the hard knowledge you walk away with from doing a startup. There are an incredible amount of subtle things you learn as well, that may or may not be correlated with the startup and what the startup does itself. The financial change also helped me realize what I really wanted and what I didn't want. I came into the startup thinking I wanted a lot of things. After the sale, I got an incredibly nice place, a new car, etc... but then realized one day out of the blue, I sat there quietly on my couch and realize I barely sat in it more than a handful of times. I had a nice TV I never watched (ever since I got into doing my startup, TV became non-existant and the habit stayed), etc... All these things I gotten that I thought I wanted were things I no longer cared about.<p>I did a full 180 and got rid of almost everything, instead choosing to adopt a minimalistic life. Especially after I read a blog post from a friend who did something similar. He sold off all his possession, cars, house, etc... and everything he owned fit into a single backpack. Nothing more. It was an incredibly sense of freedom. He then went traveling around the world. I had no interest in traveling anymore but the idea of an extreme minimalistic life really appealed to me at that point. And that's what I did.<p>Of course other things that vastly was life changing was getting rid of all my debt, my family's debt, giving my parents a chunk of money to enjoy their lives, etc...<p>5. For the most part though, outside of the above, things doesn't change as much as people think they do. My day to day is a slight variation of what it was before. I still hang out with all my friends like nothing changed. I still work day in and day out on the computer on new projects, etc.. I still eat out at the same places, and for the most part, even when I wasn't financial secure, I never thought twice about my spending habits so that part didn't change aside from not owning any debt. Overall, I would say the biggest change is probably my perspective on life (the kind I actually wanted) and I am fortunate enough to be picky about what I want to do with my time now.<p>Hope that helps.",1346847194

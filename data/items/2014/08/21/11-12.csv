I&#x27;ve never run across a situation where the lack of an everything-is-an-expression-is-a-list feature prevented me from doing what I wanted to do.</i><p>This is classic Blub paradox. You don&#x27;t feel like you need a feature until you start using it, at which point you start wondering how anyone can live without it. Tools you have available limit the thoughts you can have.

With Soundcloud, I can follow a few record labels, and discover lots of new music, easily.<p>Because of this, Soundcloud serves as a great platform for trending music. A song can be posted there and spread solely within the site, without much outside help, thanks both to the liking/reposting of songs and Soundcloud&#x27;s &quot;trending&quot; section. With Spotify, you either have to already follow the artist or hope one of your Facebook friends is listening.<p>Which is another advantage of Soundcloud--it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find other users with the same tastes.

8206837,comment,8206504,8206722,1,0,lutusp,,,"> That&#x27;s a rather bold claim to levy against an entire field without any evidence to back it up.<p>As to evidence, it&#x27;s copious. The NIMH has recently abandoned the DSM as a basis for scientific research proposals for the simple reasons that it has no scientific content. Also, you need to understand that psychologists have the burden of evidence to produce positive evidence of robust scientific theories backed by empirical observations, not on their critics to prove a negative, which is what you&#x27;re proposing. Proving a negative is an impossible burden (example: try disproving the existence of Bigfoot), and here it&#x27;s misplaced in any case.<p>> While it&#x27;s true that there are a lot of psychologists out there who are not doing good science, it&#x27;s quite unfair to say that psychology doesn&#x27;t &quot;offer explanations&quot; or &quot;craft testable theories&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s a simple fact, it&#x27;s hardly controversial. Count the number of explanations (theories) offered by psychologists over the years that were empirical and testable, and that survived the subsequent tests -- or, for that matter, that were conclusively falsified using empirical evidence. There aren&#x27;t any.<p>> Remember, cognitive psychology (brain imaging and reaction time data) and neuropsychology ...<p>&quot;Neuropsychology&quot; is a desperate attempt to conflate mind studies and brain studies. Psychology&#x27;s subject is the mind. Neuroscience&#x27;s subject is the brain and nervous system. There&#x27;s no common ground. Many psychologists are calling themselves neuropsychologists now, aware that mind studies have been discredited on the basis that it&#x27;s impossible to empirically study something that has no empirical existence, and that science requires empirical observations.<p>To those who say that the mind is a manifestation of the brain&#x27;s activity, that&#x27;s an interesting philosophical position, but it can&#x27;t be verified (or refuted) empirically, because the mind is not an empirical entity. This means all this talk about the life of the mind is philosophy, not science. It&#x27;s certainly too soon to be offering mind treatments and claiming it as science, without any empirical evidence. This is how and why recovered memory therapy went off the rails -- there was no empirical basis to falsify any claim, which meant that any claim could be -- and was -- made:<p><a href=""http://arachnoid.com/trouble_with_psychology/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/trouble_with_psychology/</a>",1408621452

Where does <i>functional</i> fit in and what is the name for &quot;non-functional&quot;? Well, that&#x27;s not clear, as &quot;functional&quot; (in the PL sense) doesn&#x27;t even have an agreed upon definition. Is Clojure &quot;functional&quot;, then? Well, it&#x27;s certainly not pure like Haskell is (and it has explicit loops etc.), but it does encourage more uses of function composition than, say, Java, it&#x27;s <i>more</i> declarative, and it also isn&#x27;t object-oriented, but that doesn&#x27;t make it not imperative. Actually, I think even Haskell still qualifies as imperative.<p>But Clojure can certainly be contrasted with OO and procedural languages (even though at least one of its core abstractions -- protocols -- is borrowed from OO).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming</a>",1408620835

For example, I always liked to play tennis (and have many years of competitive table tennis behind me). Before I started working with a coach, my practises were mostly playing the game, maybe having a few swings against a wall when I didn&#x27;t have a partner.

This meant that if a task with a priority of 1 wanted to use as much CPU as it wanted, then all tasks with a priority of 0 or below would be completely starved. This meant that you could boost a certain process (like, say, a CD writer) and get close to real-time behaviour. I was certainly writing coaster-free CDs on a much less powerful Amiga than a Linux box that constantly made coasters from buffer under-runs.<p>Linux, however, has virtual memory and &quot;nice&quot;, which complicates matters. A process with a niceness of 19 will still take a small amount of CPU in the presence of another process with a niceness of -20. In the presence of a fork bomb, you may have a very large number of processes. If they all (by some miracle) have a niceness of 19, you still have very little CPU time left for a process with a normal or negative niceness. Infinity multiplied by a small number is still infinity. Real-time priorities are the only thing that will save you here.<p>You also have the problem of being able to actually change the processes&#x27; nicenesses. That requires CPU time, which you no longer have. You would be better off sending a kill signal.

This was done for a variety of reasons, none of which had anything to do with a lack of scientific research or evidence on the various conditions elucidated in the DSM (reasons like: &quot;preserving continuity&quot;, &quot;insurance concerns&quot; and &quot;ease of use&quot;). The modern DSM is absolutely a problem, but it&#x27;s not a problem because the science is crap. It&#x27;s a problem, because the people in charge of the DSM (and yes there were a few psychologists there) didn&#x27;t prioritize sound science.",1408619532

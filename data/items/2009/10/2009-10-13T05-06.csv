Isn't it possible that you'd get more money by investing in attracting the highly talented students and reaping the later benefits, like large alumni donations?<p>> <i>If you're running a University as an educational institution it's also incorrect.

Usually it's heard in the context of justifying race-based admissions.<p>> <i>Also, as an educational institution is it your goal to improve society as a whole through education.</i><p>Are you stating this as fact? I'm honestly not sure since you wrote, ""is it"".

The statement implies an answer to the question, so I'll feel like I already have an answer to the question, and I'd be wrong.<p>So no, it's not a direct answer to a question, but it's meant to imply an answer to the question so people don't ask anything further.

I am saying this because I have attended Keiretsu forum meetings and these are very nice people.. they maintain office/staff/provide food at events and put in lot of efforts to promote startups..If you have not attended meeting then please do so..They seem to be not making profits by charging startups but covering operational costs (I don't know financial details but this is my guess).  Now question is who pays for the services - I feel it is not at all outrageous for companies to pay here because the companies they select are generally already revenue generating companies, many of the companies are not in related field to a particular angel..as a matter of fact they advice you not to invest for quite a few deals when you start so you learn ins and outs..If they start charging more to angel members then the number of angels who engage in the process might drop ..may be you will say those are not right kind of investors who you want but be careful what you wish for. There are number of people in the group who are rich enough to sponsor whole thing but again, that's another model..sponsorship has its own strings attached. Coming back to my first point - just having different operational model does not equate to scam and people without getting facts falling for propaganda is no good",1255413090

Considering correlation alone, ""most billionaires are male"" does not mean that selecting only males will help maximize the number of billionaires you pick, especially since billionaires are a small group while males are a large one.<p>Suppose 1% of males are billionaires and 0.1% of females are billionaires.

Eliminating females from your sample will increase your ""billionaire rate"" from .55% to 1%.<p>Now suppose that 10% of billionaires are children of billionaires; half of those are male and half female.  Let's say 1% of both males and females are children of billionaires.  Suppose your college has two applicants, a male child of a billionaire, a female child of a billionaire, and a male child of non-billionaires.

The college that wants to maximize billionaire alumni should not select only males.  Instead, it should choose children of billionaires over all others.  Then the rate increases to 5.5%.",1255412817

Because they have stricter policies and fewer, perhaps less-trained or experienced staff, and they build a business model on those factors, not around caring for you.

Most of it is breathtaking if, like me, you have a thing for 19th-century brick, and can see past the run-down state and imagine what it <i>should</i> look like.<p>What we have is quiet.  Not absence-of-life quiet, but something more contemplative in nature.  Earlham College, 150 years of Quaker history, an industrial history that is mostly gone now.  If you ever just wanted the world to <i>shut up</i> for a year while you got your startup working, this would be that opportunity.  That's how I see it.<p>But you could put that anywhere.  It's just that I know where the good houses are; I walk the dog past them every day and think, man, I could put five smart people in there.  And I'd get to save another grand old house.",1255410610

A college admissions officer was interviewed, and she admitted to thinking something like, ""Oh great, another one of these kids"" whenever she saw another Asian applicant who plays a musical instrument, (insert other stereotypical activities), etc.<p>Your first reaction might be to accuse her of racism, but you can see why she would have the reaction she does. In certain areas, especially with large, high-achieving Asian communities, a lot of Asian children are encouraged by their parents to do essentially the same things to increase their chances of being admitted to the ""top"" schools. Is it any surprise that college admissions officers are getting bored of seeing very similar applications?<p>Not that this necessarily justifies the decisions, or that this is the only reason for this phenomenon; obviously, it is not.",1255410295
878399,comment,877896,878265,0,0,rickdangerous1,,,"Well I tried this approach with my IT career. I avoided the high cost college fees by relying on commercial programming courses and my work experience (started on help desks and now I'm an independant software development consultant). I also avoided big student loans (though I did end up with about 10k owing) and basically continued to work part time or fulltime since high school graduation.
So I did pretty much exactly what you suggested but heres my problem. I wonder about the path I didn't take and the kind of interesting work I could be having now if i paid the money and went to a top tier CS college. What kind of interesting research work or product development work could I be doing now, if I had invested in a first class education?<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not doing badly...but I wonder about the jobs I have the talent for and interest in but not the educational background...many doors are shut to me now because of a decision I made to forego college 15 years ago.",1255410285

I tried a few things, figured out it wasn't my network so i thought that maybe pandora was down.  i went on twitter and searched #pandora... sure enough, 4 posts in the last few minutes that pandora was down.  I added my tweet saying the same thing.<p>Later, my wife was stuck in a huge traffic jam, i went on twitter and searched for her location and the word 'accident' and sure enough, up came a link to a web page detailing why there was such congestion and how far it went.<p>twitter is good for finding out about something that is happening RIGHT now.",1255410194

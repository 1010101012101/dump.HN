So, while a threaded model would solve the problems, it also incurs necessary overhead (that works towards solving irrelevant problems).

How meaningful is it to be rank 5623 vs. rank 5249, or even rank 2519? I don't think people can make much sense of ranks beyond 100, but maybe I'm wrong.

In my opinion it's not, a design that doesn't convert doesn't have any business value. For what reasons someone should pay for a website if that website doesn't have any mean or any return?
You understand that this is exactly what I'm talking about? A customer buys something that has no use and no impact, of course he wants to spend less, and he is damn right.
And that's also why I say that a designer must be a designer, if you have no clue about human interaction you're simply not a designer - can you imagine an industrial designer crafting some crap without any idea about how the user will interact with it? No, it's totally laughable, that's why it doesn't happen.",1304894593

It's hard to say what qualifies as ""essential reading"" when it's impossible for a human being to read even one tenth of the great, all-time classic books. There just isn't enough time. My advice would be to read at least a few books that have reputations for being difficult. <i>War and Peace</i>, <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i>, <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>, <i>Ulysses</i>, etc. (The reason I'm only listing near-undisputed classics here is because these books <i>are</i> difficult, and in some cases very, very long [looking at you, Proust], and the assurance that it is all worth it helps you keep going when your brain hurts.) These books survived despite their difficulty because reading them is a mind-expanding, sometimes life-changing experience. Reading shouldn't be essentially passive.",1304893656

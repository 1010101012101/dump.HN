It follows a kid from birth to about 18 months in each of SF, Tokyo, Mongolia, and Namibia.<p>The biggest surprise me was how self-sufficient the Mongolian and Namibian kids were.  They'd play with other kids or just do their own thing.<p>By contrast, the SF and Tokoy kids were <i>always</i> with a parent.  One scene in particular struck me - the SF kid was peeling a banana.  Instead of tossing it, she held the peel like a piece of refuse until her mom dutifully took it.  Perhaps the kid was a neat freak, but compared to the Mongolian and Namibian kids, it seemed like her parent put her at the center of her world and catered to her every whim.  When you've got a caretaker entertaining you, taking you places, cleaning you, feeding you, and changing their lives significantly to suit you, how do you not become entitled?",1284487082

The benefits of this approach are described in the post here.<p>On a side note, I emailed Faruk Ateş (who wrote this post entitled ""Pure CSS Icons: Make The Madness Stop"" [1]) to see what he thought, and he said it was a pretty solid implementation.<p>One of the things that Faruk (and skatey on IRC) brought up is that one of the age-old annoyances with inline emoticon replacement in bodies of text (prevalent in forums) is that they break the line-height of the text. I had to make the choice for this plugin to either keep the text the right size (and thus the emoticon a little larger than line-height), or make the actual text smaller so that the emoticon is exactly line-height. I chose the former, but upon further reflection, I'll probably change to the latter in the next release.<p>[1] <a href=""http://farukat.es/journal/2010/08/469-pure-css-icons-make-madness-stop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://farukat.es/journal/2010/08/469-pure-css-icons-make-ma...</a><p>EDIT: BTW, here is a direct link to the live demo: <a href=""http://www.alfajango.com/blog/jquery-css-emoticons-plugin/jquery-css-emoticons-demo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alfajango.com/blog/jquery-css-emoticons-plugin/jq...</a>",1284487025

You really want to share stuff only with specific groups, but this is hard to do on existing sites.<p>This leads to all sorts of real pain points, many of which are becoming unbearable for some users: i.e. you don't want your boss seeing photos of you drinking, or you don't want your grandmother to see that racy link you just posted, so you suspend your FB account.<p>Even though Facebook has a crude groups feature, this doesn't come close to addressing the fundamentally flawed orientation of the network: one, big pot of 100 to 1000 casual acquaintances, as opposed to dozens of partitioned ~2 to 10-person real social circles.<p>This idea has been exploding, recently:<p>- Google Me (Google's soon-to-be-released last shot at social) is almost certainly going to be based around this concept of contextual sharing (as Google UX engineer @padday's recent slide show indicated)<p>- Diaspora (the OSS project from NYU students that raised $200k this spring) announced on their blog that contextual sharing is their #1 interface priority<p>- Frid.ge (YC '10) is built around this idea<p>- College Only (funded by Peter Thiel) is a solution to the problem just for one context (college friends)<p>- Groupme.com (betaworks) is an SMS-only approach<p>And ALL of this projects came to life within the past 3 to 6 months!<p>Next-generation social networks will mirror our offline social experience more closely by shifting the focus from a giant network of ""friends"" to private, micro-networks that mimic real friend groups.<p>I think this change is significant enough that Facebook will be unable to pivot without alienating their huge user base.<p>Also, one of Facebook's main competitive advantages has been the fact that it is a network good with high switching costs (e.g. in order for a new site to be as good as facebook, you need to convince all of your 800 friends to sign up for the new site too).<p>If the future of social networking really is contextual sharing, though, this barrier becomes much lower (if it continues to exist at all), because if you really just want to share with your 'real' friends, then convincing these small groups whom you know really well (your best buds, or your roommates, or your sibilings, or whatever) to try out a new site is actually pretty trivial.<p>Thoughts?<p>Full-disclosure: I'm thinking of building a contextual sharing tool of my own, because I think it's so damn exciting.

This spectrum would have been open to anybody, and would have allowed anybody, using spread spectrum to operate a data network, nationwide.<p>The reason we're in the spot we're in, and the carriers have so much control, is that the FCC issued only three licenses for each goegraphic area in the spectrum auctions.  This limits competition and ensures a near monopoly pricing power for the big three carriers.  Subsequent changes have loosened this a little bit, but not a lot.<p>The real problem here is the idea that spectrum can be ""owned"" and that our government gets to dictate (based on bribes- which is what spectrum ""Sales"" are really) who gets to ""own"" the spectrum.<p>Apple tried, and I believe google tried recently, to create unowned spectrum.

Yes, Android is not as free or open for the end consumer as it could be because Google has made too many concessions to carriers (modifying UI, apps that cannot be uninstalled, slow updates, etc). However, their model is still far more open than iOS, for the simple fact that you can install anything you want on it.

Soccer is popular almost everywhere in the world except in the United States, so it's obviously not a Western thing, and there are other sports highly popular in some countries and not in others. It has more to do with history than with any fascination. For example, cricket and snooker are extremely popular in countries that used to be parts of Great Britain, but that's just history, not any ""worship"" of England.",1284484777

The attack only needs 40 public/private key pairs such that the public key pairs span M ⊂ (Z/256Z)40, the module generated by all public keys. Since HDCP devices divulge their public keys freely, one can easily test whether a set of 40 devices have public keys spanning M before expending the effort to extract their private keys. With these keys, the authority’s secret can be recovered in only a few seconds on any desktop computer.""<p>Edited to add the next paragraph (paper was published in 2001):<p>""The consequence of these flaws is that, after recovering the private keys of 40 devices, we can attack every other interoperable HDCP device in existence: we can decrypt eavesdropped communications, spoof the identity of other devices, and even forge new device keys as though we were the trusted center. Note that this allows us to bypass any revocation list or “blacklisting”: such mechanisms are rendered completely ineffective by these flaws in HDCP. Therefore we recommend that the current HDCP cryptosystem should be abandoned and replaced with standard cryptographic primitives.""",1284484705

Google bought YouTube, and that seems to be working alright thus far. Amazon bought Zappos, and they haven't been relegated to the dust bin.<p>""As soon as [the talent has] to deal with three layers of reporting, quarterly budget cycles, and swing-door managers, they turn off the creativity and head for the exit.""<p>True, but here is a novel idea: don't make your prized acquisition deal with that crap. Yeah it'll require significant work to get it to be a good relationship, but if both parties can pull it off, it can be hugely beneficial for everyone.<p>Look, I know 37s really likes to paint acquisitions as black and white, but they just aren't.",1284483866

That's the only new thing with this Priority Inbox - you've been able to do this for some time with filters and multiple inbox (labs feature).<p>I want to explicitly filter things that are important to me.

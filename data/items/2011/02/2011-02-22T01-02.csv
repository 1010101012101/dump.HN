2248288,comment,2246342,2248104,0,0,Sakes,,,"I think what it really comes down to is profit margins.  Over the years I've heard many times that a company with a 30% profit margin is a very profitable company.  Apple is destroying any incentive for companies, operating at or below a 30% profit margin, to make their products available via the app store.<p>If a company is operating on a 30% profit margin, then apple is not taking away 30% of what that company is making off of that user, they are taking away 100% of what that company is making off of that user.  At that point, the company is better off moving their developer resources towards creating additional functionality for other platforms to up sell current customers on.<p>You already have great services jumping ship like pandora and last.fm.  I use pandora everyday, and if I can't get pandora on an iPhone, that is a purchase killer for me.  These content providers are typically operating on a 10% profit margin, so I think they would actually lose money by servicing iphone users.<p>I do think development for the iPhone will continue for many of these companies for the time being, since as I understand it you can still install apps on the iPhone from outside the app store.  But if this changes, I think many of them will cease to develop for it, since it would be economic suicide.<p>Please forgive me if I misused any eco terms above.

Yes, in the real world they are, but the Fed can set them wherever they want and have been doing that.<p>In fact, the lower the rate, the more we all borrow and bid up prices for things.

But the inflation does actually exist, whether they wish to ignore it or not.<p>Going to market rates would go a long way to fixing the distortions, to be sure.

When developers can't ""throw code over the wall to QA"" because there is no QA, they will do a better job testing it themselves.<p>I don't buy the popular opinion that developers can't test their own code like there is some sort of magic that goes on in the mind of QA engineers that causes them to be able to find bugs that developers couldn't find themselves. In fact, I think the opposite is true - developers are better suited to test the features they are writing because they know the code and know the risk areas, where things need to be regression tested, where more attention should be placed, etc.<p>I do think that it can be helpful for another set of eyes to look at a developed feature and this is where pair programming can be useful. It does not need to be QA doing this.<p>One caveat is that this approach does not work for all teams. This works for small, agile teams where roles and responsibilities are less defined.

Selling access to a web app is painful because you have to ask people to enter credit card details, or sign in to a third party payment processor, lots of hassle. With the AppStore, it is just as easy to take people's money as it is to give away your app for free. So, Apple is providing a service, and it seems fair that Apple would get paid for that service.<p>The main issue with the AppStore cut is that Apple doesn't allow direct competition to the AppStore on iDevices (I think that 30% would be smaller if users were not locked in to the AppStore) however the value added is real.<p>With the new subscription rules, the value added by Apple is much less clear, since Readability was already taking in money without Apple's help. So, the assumption is that Apple's subscription tools won't provide a boost to sales large enough to cover Apple's cut, hence unfair. With Readability's 70%-goes-to-authors business model, they will never be able to make up the loss by selling more content.<p>I've not tried out Readability, but the argument is probably that they fall into the first category along with the AppStore, since they make it easier to give money to creators without having to look at ads.

We were living in Seattle and healthcare was the most expensive when I was employed full-time and my wife was pregnant.<p>Luckily, the company nearly tanked and let me go along with my entire department. I've been a self-employed consultant since then (almost 3 years) and went without insurance for about a year just so I could afford to pay for my wife and kid.<p>Then I figured out some hacks. I found a startup health practice called Qliance in Seattle which Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos and Drew Carey have funded (nice article about it here: <a href=""http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2010/04/jeff_bezos_michael_dell_drew_carey_and_others_back_health_care_startup.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2010/04/jeff_bezos_michael_...</a>).<p>For about $50/month each for my wife and I and $40 for my kid (total of ~$140) were able to see a doctor any time we wanted for non-emergencies without co-pays.<p>I can't tell you how much weight this was off my back. Staff was friendly, service was great, modern offices, experienced doctors. Couldn't have asked for more. We got a high deductible family plan along with it which added about $200 to the costs. If you are in the Seattle area and are self-employed, this is probably your best option.<p>The second hack was that we moved to Japan about a year ago. As others have mentioned, they have a very consumer-friendly system over here. I had a big health scare when we first moved which required lots of medication and several doctor visits, but it didn't set us back more than a couple hundred bucks.<p>I'm really worried about moving back to the US now. I hope things get better before we move back in a couple of years.",1298337051

83650,comment,83569,83569,0,0,jey,,,"""Rewrite the whole system"" is generally a BAD idea. You might want to have one or two senior guys go and prototype the core parts of the new .NET version. You can then add resources to the new one as it progresses. In a lot of cases the development of the new one can overtake the developed-in-parallel old one if it's done well, since they don't have to work with all the overhead of the old legacy junk.<p>And if the new development project fails, oh well, you only sunk a few man-months into the failed project. The sunk cost is smaller, so it's easier to abandon.",1196103419

83647,comment,83569,83569,0,0,jklubnik,,,"Treating the old application as the spec for the new one is usually not a good idea. Define the problem(s) the new application is trying to solve instead of trying to copy the behavior of the old application. This is important for both developers and users.

I'll take this as a lesson that the word ""year"" should be in bold.<p>The ""sort-by-date"" feature is the starting point for what distinguishes ourdoings.com.  But I don't want to go into detail here.  If you have a few hundred photos that lend themselves to chronological organization, make yourself a free site and give it a try.  If you don't like it, use the ""Tear down this site..."" option on your site info page, and the ""Forget I exist..."" option on your personal info page.<p>More relevant to the business model question, it's important to look at the ad vs pay question from your customer's point of view.  From my own point of view, pay is better because I don't want ads on the pages where I share my photos.  However, I'm catering toward people who have very little time to spare.  Freeing them from filling out a form with credit card info is a time saver.  They will put up with ads for other convenience.<p>Initially it was pay-only, but I changed it.",1196102460

When you are selecting which VC funds to target you should be sure to avoid funds that do not take risks that are still associated with your venture.<p>The risk categories essentially can be categorized according to the investment criteria that VCs consider.

83635,comment,83569,83569,0,0,samb,,,"this isn't the greatest answer, but it's what we do: we do what makes sense based on the information available at the time. and then we adjust what we're doing based on the information gained as the project goes on. sometimes core mods have to be built first. sometimes we can grab low-hanging fruit first.<p>so, i'd have to say ""it depends.""<p>no one can answer this question for you, in my opinion. not without a full understanding of the history and objectives. and even then, it'll be wrong and have to be adjusted as the project unfolds.<p>so i suppose i agree with robmnl, but methodology alone isn't the cure.",1196101217

83631,comment,83429,83429,0,0,snorkel,,,"95% of laptop thieves are not computer saavy. Rest assured they are not examining your hard drive for sensistive data or reading your email, data theft is too sophisticated for laptop thiefs and takes valuable time that could be spent smoking crack, but needless to say changing your online passwords is first order of business. If your laptop was a windows PC then the thief traded it for pot to a cousin who is currently installing pirated games on it. If the laptop was running anything other than windows then the hard drive has been reformatted. If it was a Mac laptop then it was traded to a fence for cash who reformatted it then put it on ebay.<p>Fortunately laptops are getting cheaper. The best policy is buy a cheap laptop and assume it will be lost, stolen, or broken. Treat it as disposable.\n",1196100169

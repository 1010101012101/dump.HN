Often times some people neglect some latency introduced due to analog filtering, but it's nowhere near the order of 60ns.  Furthermore, most of these systems are almost always calibrated daily with fiber optics, lasers, or other subatomic particles or particle accelerators.  So often times the delay is actually relative to a particle (usually a photon) moving at or near the speed of light in a medium with a known refractive index.  I'm sure it's not too hard to find the whitepaper for the equipment if you really wanted to look for it.<p>I'm not saying it's not possible, it's just extremely unlikely.

When you install my package, I can infect other packages and have them execute arbitrary code without you realizing it.\nThis is by no means unique to python, and in fact can happen whenever you run any program. It just shows the dangers of running things you don't really trust.\nDoing this in python is, however, slightly harder to detect, as you are changing the pyc file and not the py file itself.  Someone who looks at the source will notice nothing amiss, and in fact if the update the source the pyc will be rebuilt cleanly (until it gets reinfected).\nJavascript and ruby are not generally byte-compiled and so you would have to change the source to infect them.\nOther languages that compile either to bytecode or executables can be just as easily be infected.",1317059610

By public I mean that has escaped the closed circle of the vendor, and in the case of a reported vulnerabilty, also the reporter.<p>If you find out a vulnerability is being exploited in the wild, and already have a patch or technical description, you should release it. If one of the two parts commits a mistake and releases information about the vulnerability (like, for example, a patch that can be reverse-engineered), then all other involved parts should release what they have.<p>If they don't have a patch or if they aren't ready to release it, which seems to be the case here, Adobe should at least release technical details.

In it, there was a quite obvious problem with the numbers where the reported percentage increase was nowhere near what the numbers suggested. I raised my hand to point it out and was mildly surprised when the manager giving the presentation told me that he didn't want to report numbers that were too high. I decided not to point out that mathematics doesn't care about what he wants to report.<p>So anyway, this guy who is paid lots of money at a reasonably sized company doesn't even have a passing knowledge of statistics, something that every school child was supposed to learn. Would he have been better able to do his job if he knew math? Probably. But he doesn't know math. All those years in school didn't really rub off on him.<p>In any case, if you were to ask how many people use literary analysis, math, art, history or science in their work the answer is going to be close to zero. It's true that lots of people write as part of their job, but most people write poorly and most writing classes focus on analyzing Shakespeare, not writing reports on employee efficiency.<p>Another argument for programming in schools is the same as the argument for literature in schools. Even if you never need to program in the real world being able to program implies that you have certain cognitive and logical abilities that many jobs require. For example, it is important to be logical if you are a lawyer, even though you needn't program.<p>I would not be prepared to dismiss coding out of hand because not many people are programmers.

There were also classes available in tractor repair, farming, ROTC, track and field, etc. Our high school was able to fit more classes in than other schools because each year was split into fall and spring with 4 classes each half.<p>Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that there's room for more and for modification.

Regardless, the use of an outside provider is still a move toward centralization. Ten years ago, the small offices I did software work in all had local email servers. Today, running an email server well is a big job, and those offices all outsource their email service to much larger companies.<p><i>People ... demand the ""follow individual"" pattern (RSS) ... In the future some smart kid will come up with a ""DNS for social relations""</i><p>It's interesting that you bring up RSS. I was thinking about that too. I think RSS is already very nearly a ""DNS for social relations."" But it's also failed to catch on outside the circle of techies, early adopters, and web-potatoes.<p>I'd say the failure of RSS to achieve mainstream popularity is an example of a decentralized system losing out to centralized alternatives. Like Facebook. Facebook is just plain simpler to get started with than a self-administered approach like RSS or a hypothetical next-generation DNSfSR would be. And Facebook and Twitter both killed off their RSS feeds once they'd felt they'd achieved a certain critical mass. They understand that RSS is an alternative for much of what they do.<p>I don't celebrate any of this. I use and like RSS. I wish I didn't feel the need for a Facebook account (but that's where my real-world friends are). But the pattern I see is that convenience beats out control every time. For complicated devices like computers and for complicated situations like the (real, human) social network, the inevitable complexity that comes along with local, personal control is often a problem, not a feature.<p>Under such circumstances, I don't see how Facebook (or its successor) will be overtaken by a distributed anything.",1317057841

The video on the homepage is probably the best way to understand it.<p>Few points that I would appreciate feedback:<p>* I realized that the marketing message of this service is not clear to people, however I seem to have failed to get it right. The only way I can get people to react to this service is by showing the video of a phone actually being updated in realtime.<p>* Design/UI/Focus - It seems to me that this product has few user-stories/scenarios (e.g: discovering new people to communicate in real-life), however until now the only positive feedback I was able to get from my friends and family was the syncing of the contact details. Should I drop/hide the groups + messaging part of this service? (I also realize that the groups + message purpose and behavior is not clear to the most user, but am still trying to find out what design/flow could make it more clear)<p>* Technically: the service is running on Django-nonrel + AppEgnine, however recently I've had a feeling that it would be easier and maybe cheaper to use EC2+Mongo backend instead. Anybody had experience migrating Django-nonrel appengine app into mongo backend?\n* Monetization - I feel that getting companies to pay for their presence in their clients phonebook could work, but am not sure that this is the best path for monetization.<p>* I realize that there are other companies doing similar things, however I feel that the way it's currently designed is different. Also this service is very easy to replicate, and still again I feel I have a clear way of how I would like to make progress and differentiate from other products. Any suggestions on the matter?<p>Thanks,\nAlon Burg",1317057082

I'm not saying that this is likely to happen, but it has occurred to me that a competitor could simply purchase a number of prepaid credit cards, and use each, from its own email address and IP address, to make purchases from my website, and then, for each purchase, complain to my credit card processor that I've done a lousy job in servicing their order.

There are tens, probably even hundreds, of terribly severe remote code execution bugs known to major vendors and not yet patched. Patching takes time and money.

It's not enough to be the ""thing"" the customer is looking for, you have to be there <i>at the time they want to purchase</i>. That is Google's greatest advantage: when you're looking to purchase something, you turn to search, not to social.<p>I see a couple of things happening though:<p>* Not all purchases are customer initiated, and based on the time users are spending on Facebook, they're in a much better position to capitalize on impulse and casual purchases.<p>* I've seen an increase in the number of friends who post ""Hey, what phone should I get"" and similar questions. This social behavior was commonplace prior to the advent of relevant, usable search. We may see a return to this leveraging of social knowledge for important purchases. Facebook has a significant advantage there.<p>Even with virtually zero effort, Facebook is going to begin to eat in to Google's territory, simply as a result of the sheer volume of eyes on ads. Right now, Facebook is continuing to focus on engaging users. They're digging deep roots in to our lives, and appear to be focusing on partnerships that aren't ad-related right now. These partnerships are also in markets that are inherently social. Music, for example, is a very social product. It makes perfect sense for Facebook to form strong partnerships there.<p>It's difficult to say when (or if) Facebook will focus on general advertising as a revenue stream. They certainly have a product, but I don't know how effective it is. I've seen a fair number of anecdotal write-ups that suggest it doesn't work all that well, but for individuals with a rational, causal mindset, advertising frequently ""does not compute"", so it's hard to say if there isn't significant bias there.",1317056695

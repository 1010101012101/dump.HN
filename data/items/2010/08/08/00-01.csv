Actually, once I got used to the function definition syntax, I like that too and felt it was very concise.<p>I like the flexibility that strings are lists (arrays?) of characters, which was incredibly useful for implementing a parser.  I'm sure that would come in handy in just about any project.<p>The type system...eh.  I did a bit of fighting with it which apparently is normal for newbies, and I can see the advantage of having it during the compilation stage from a performance perspective.  It just didn't grab me by the collar like the other features did.",1281229057

Having engineers and managers on board that have personally experienced such problems and solved/triaged/otherwise dealt with them seems valuable.  Firing them runs the risk of creating a chilling effect toward risk taking, as well as lobotomizing some valuable experience from the company.<p>Now, maybe the executive was let go because he knew about the antenna problem beforehand, misrepresented its severity to Jobs, and launched the product anyway, in which case, yeah let him go.  I recall some speculation that Apple knew about the problem before hand.<p>But for honest mistakes, with no deception involved, that hurt in the short term but are solvable and no more than a blip in the long term, maybe that's not so wise.<p>Thoughts?",1281228953
1584674,comment,1583816,1584082,0,0,statictype,,,"I believe the Go language gets most of the effects of ducktyping in a statically typed language. The compiler is smart enough to figure out if an object adheres to a specific interface without having to explicitly tag that object as implementing the said interface. \nSo this basically means if you have a method which just calls 'read' on it's argument, you can define a 'read' interface and it will accept any existing type that responds to 'read'",1281228940

1584666,comment,1582582,1583610,0,0,jbz,,,"Did you read the article in full? I know its a rude question to ask but it really seems like you didnt because youre falling prey to exactly the type of thinking it highlights as the problem. The solution doesnt ""feel"" right, and we humans are without peer in justifying our discomfort avoidance in cloaks of righteousness, truth, etc. That the correct solution just happens to coincide with the solution that avoids self-doubting discomfort is serendipity. Even this serendipity is so rarely noticed, let alone questioned, doesn't this seem odd?<p>Take for instance healthcare, its spiraling costs. A doctor ordering what some would call excessive tests for a patient is doing the right thing. It is better to be safe than sorry after all. The trial lawyers, insurance companies, government handouts and so on are the reason its skyrocketing.<p>What about the human fault of judging ones own immoral actions and impropriety on a relative scale of those around us? What about compounding that by generally giving everyone an ""i am a good person"" foundational belief. To examine it with no intention of challenging it will cause most people to feel a tangible unease because they're treading on some dangerous ground, a sense of fear that its best not to mess around in this place in case you break something accidentally. Each human with an intact ""i am good"" core applies goodness to all their actions by default, meaning if a person is not truly judging their motives or reasoning they are deemed to be ""good"" actions with pure motives because they are good and nothing specifically shows they're doing ""bad"" right that moment.<p>When the city with one of the fastest rising health costs in the US was examined it was found that the rising costs had a partner along for the trip, medical procedures and tests were rising as well. The doctors were doing nothing illegal, and obviously none of them thought they were doing anything wrong. So why the rise? It was just doctors increasingly exploring that grey area that doesn't challenge your central belief of your own goodness. Patient complains of headaches, and worries about something they read online about brain tumors, the doctor thinks its unlikely but its better safe than sorry, and imagine if he does have a brain tumor not only would i have missed it i might be sued too. Repeat this process over and over and goalposts move, more behavior is acceptable such as ""ok so maybe she didnt need hip replacement surgery right now, but she definitely would have needed it soon, and im a far cry from Doctor EvilCompetitor, i cant believe he talked that poor shmuck into allowing brain surgery!"".<p>Consider the complicated medical conditions that homeless contract on the streets with illness on top of illness requiring weeklong ICU visits, it becomes drastically reduced if a person is living in a home. A single avoided hospital visit of that kind alone can justify the free apartment for year or two or three.<p>Im trying to find that article again, will post link when i find it.",1281228387

1584638,comment,1584260,1584455,0,0,cmurphycode,,,"You're right about Twitter hitting the missing square in the periodic table. I think you glaze over the importance of the short nature of Twitter, though.<p>Yes, you can write arbitrarily short blog posts. But you don't, because you feel like you have an obligation to make your official blog be a well written, safe-for-future-eyes snapshot of your personality. Most of us have started a blog with grand intentions and given up after the effort of crafting essays carefully became too much.<p>Twitter requires no more commitment than a minute of your time. The simplicity of the medium (<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdorsey/182613360/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/jackdorsey/182613360/</a>) is its greatest strength, and it is also why nobody else was able to make it. It takes a special sort of daring to provide a product that does so little. I'm sure users are constantly clamoring for the 140 character limit to be lifted, for new features to be added, and for more in general. But if Twitter had been created with no emphasis on short, simple messages, it would've been just like all the other blog ecosystems.<p>The impact of the small commitment goes beyond the importance to the average user. I think that one of the huge factors in Twitter's success was all of the hype generated by celebrities. What better way for celebrities to connect with their fans? They can do it in the privacy of their home, it takes nearly zero effort, they get extra points for being tech-savvy, and they cut out the middleman of the media. For the star basketball player who think he's misunderstood (e.g., @TheRealShaq), this is perfect. No more media twisting his words, just one-on-one conversation. Except it's better than one-on-one, because the whole world gets to see how you treat your fans.<p>In short, I think Twitter took off because even though they didn't know it yet, people yearned for a low effort medium of communication.",1281227509

Very addicting, gives one a sense of complete freedom to build and hack almost anything he desires. If you search youtube you'll be astonished at how much time and passion people have put into their creations. It gives me a feeling of an old school game, before graphics became the No.1 reason to play a game.<p>What's even greater is that Notch (the sole creator and developper), apart from being very dedicated to the project, is very accepting to users' feedback and completing requested features.",1281226185

If you have More than 100 friends/acquiantances, then talking to them say once a week or once a month is not time efficient.<p>Personal blogs and broadcast emails helped solve this problem, but the time taken to compose posts means that they are often infrequent and irregular.<p>Twitter (and Facebook) solved this by lowering the barrier to publishing by allowing it work from mobile and be short with no text formatting. Facebook was focused on a closed group of friends which left a gap for Twitter to target people who want publish to a wide number of people which includes very many people who have their own companies or otherwise see a lot of benefit from being well known.<p>I think Twitter executed well with the following:<p>- 140 character limit which forces people to be direct as non-professional writers tend to go on too long.<p>- Raising money early and therefore having a big team to build the product.<p>- API, this allowed massive innovation to happen outside twitter and to fill in the long tail of applications for this service in a way that no other site could match and they would have not been able to do internally.<p>- Keeping the product simple to use<p>- Publicity",1281225794

We're in a hilly area.  The phones are still sold out in many places, I can't believe there is any significant financial hit over this.<p>Certainly any revisions to later production and next model antenna design would have no impact on the timetable of whatever OS X and iOS projects are in the works.\nIf anything siphons talent within Apple, it'd probably be those continuing to improve iOS for iPad in particular.  Although the iPad is doing extremely well, being so new they're no doubt working very hard to make things better yet.  Apple is working hard on many fronts.  Their projects are planned, so there's no reason to expect any significant unforeseen migration of engineers between projects.<p>Realistically, the biggest thing that drives some people away from the iPhone is AT&T.  (on a personal level it is about general dislike of the company not any actual service problem, it's similar to how some have grown to feel about Microsoft. I had the feeling even before the iPhone came out)  If Apple can expand to another U.S. carrier without a significant loss due to changed AT&T terms, we could see a real change in the financial picture... more growth.<p>The comment about ""many of us are awaiting the latest OSX iteration"" puzzles me a bit.  While I'm sure Apple will add some cool new things in the future, without knowing what they are can you really be chomping at the bit?\nApple certainly does work on development of many things at one time.  Release timing is determined by many factors beyond engineering.<p>As far as hardware updates go, I think more people are interested in watching Mac hardware iterations as improved Intel chips come out.  But for the bulk of consumers the existing chips are plenty powerful.\nI'd probably most like to see third parties (including open source projects) make more use of the excellent support for using multiple cores and GPUs in the OS.  In particular I'm thinking of VLC and ffmpeg (which is the basis for many video utilities).",1281225668

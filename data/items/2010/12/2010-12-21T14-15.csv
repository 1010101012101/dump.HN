Sharper knives require better judgment to be used safely.<p>This is why we often give novices rules of thumb like ""don't use macros"" or ""don't use goto."" I've seen some people criticize this practice, but I think it's actually a good thing; when you're just starting out, you don't know when these things are really called for. Working under some constraints simplifies things.<p>With experience, you learn the pain points well enough to outgrow those rules and use macros/goto/whatever when called for.",1292943338

It might go nowhere, but throwing these kinds of suits against the prosecutor will only serve to discredit the prosecution.<p>Trail by media would be a far more effective win for Assange than a full out court battle, because all he has to do is convince a British judge that there's no merit for his extradition, and convincing the judge that there's political advantages to slandering him could be all it takes to put the nail in the prosecutions appallingly flimsy case.",1292943056

2027749,comment,2026545,2026545,0,0,yason,,,"I generally like page flips, like reading a PDF page by page instead of scrolling continuously. But the downside is that generally page-flipping is coupled with fixed layout. And usually there's too much text on a single page, making the font absurdly small.<p>The good side about scrolling is that I can choose whatever font size I want and the page just grows as necessary while I can still scroll up and down. On the other hand it's a bit more difficult to locate yourself or jump around in a big chunk of scrolling text. PgDn/PgUp is a <i>kind of</i> a page flip but usability-wise it's better to have a bit of margin on top and bottom, just like on a real paper page. Then you know where the page ends and where the next page begins, and you don't have to scan the lines to see if the browser scrolled 100% or left 3 lines visible from the previous position or what.<p>I think I would like best a solution where the content is paginated but it would be dynamically fitted onto a page whose size is the browser window size. It would only fit as much text of proper size on one page that nicely fits there. If I use a big font, then it's 20 lines; if I use a small font, it's 40 lines. But I would still get pages, maybe fewer or more. A page would have proper margins and I could reason about navigating back to something I read ""ten pages ago"".",1292940635

""Do stuff to item"" is usually better accomplished with a chain of #map, #select, #inject, #grep, etc. If ""do stuff to item"" is a multiline set of steps, sure you can use #each. I prefer, though, to abstract that set of steps into a lambda or named function and then map the function onto each item.<p>Then again, I'm biased.

Not necessarily in the sense of new leaks coming from WikiLeaks, which has been fairly tame so far.<p>I think, though, that Julian's basically validated the idea that a.) it's possible to collect, vet, and release potentially damaging information about powerful entities and b.) people care when you do.  We've had time periods like this in the past (eg. the Muckraker era at the turn of the 1900s, the Pentagon Papers from the early 70s, Watergate), but the last such era seems to have been over 30 years ago.  In the last 10+ years, we seem to have accepted the idea that it's okay for government and corporations to spy on us, but not okay for us to spy on them.<p>Julian was just the guy who had the balls to say ""Umm, two can play at this game"" and follow through on it.  He's validated the market.  It's like Napster and Friendster: the services themselves failed, but they paved the way for iTunes and FaceBook, which have become huge.<p>Can you imagine what'll happen when some enterprising anarchist hacker hooks up spyware, a botnet, and a spam network?  It's not terribly difficult to write malware that scans each infected computer for any documents and posts them as spam comments to blogs or sends them out as spam emails.  The thing is - once the information is out there, it naturally gets collaboratively-filtered.  The interesting tidbits will be forwarded on or posted to Reddit, while the boring stuff will be deleted as garden-variety spam.<p>I suspect that there's already malware out there that does exactly this, but instead of posting confidential info to random blogs, it just uplinks it to the Chinese government or some Russian mafia syndicate.<p>The impact of WikiLeaks is that it's turned a spotlight on the damage that can be done - and more important, the attention that can be gained - by leaking information.  That makes it far more likely that some bright, naughty teenager is going to think ""Hey, wouldn't it be cool if <i>everything</i> was out there?"" and dump everything out there.",1292940548

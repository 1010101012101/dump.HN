React, Angular, Backbone cover most use cases and are proven in production, well known, and well understood. Unless you&#x27;re a big company with hard problems, why should anyone pay attention? Not to rain on your parade, I&#x27;ve had the inclination to build my own libraries in the past as well but I always remember why it&#x27;s not a good plan.<p>Any new framework these days has to bring a ton of innovation and performance to the table - is your framework faster and easier to use than React? Does it fulfill use cases that React cannot? How many more use cases can React fit than yours? Hint: There&#x27;s React Canvas, React Native, React WinJS, and you can run it on your server. There&#x27;s also approximately a billion modules for these libraries combined.<p>There are plenty of examples of projects that are DOA. If you want yours to be successful you&#x27;ll REALLY have to sell it. Not that I&#x27;m rooting against you! :) If your library is more innovative and more powerful, more power to you! There&#x27;s nothing wrong with progress. I&#x27;m just skeptical because the aforementioned libraries work for nearly 100% of companies.",1439351865

Building a business on people rather than tech is a much much tougher thing to do both execution wise and financially.\nAnd so the real innovation if someone wants to &quot;change the world&quot; without trying to cheat the system is to find a way to make a profitable business with a huge part of the business being used to pay salaries. This as we can see is a very hard thing to do. And so I applaud them for trying.<p>For many entrepreneurs who are used to thinking about business as something which is based on software, servers and an internet connection, this is completely uncharted territory. You don&#x27;t reap the benefits of scaling your business as if it&#x27;s just a matter of adding more servers.\nThe primary challenges with these kind of business if they are to be built on a solid foundation is.<p>1) Patience – It takes a long time to scale an employee based business up to anything worthwhile and sustainable<p>2) Selective – You have to be smart about which sectors actually have enough money and need for your service to make a proper ROI<p>3) Employee satisfaction. You can&#x27;t just treat your people as if they are freelancers without giving them freelance opportunities. Instead you have to really care about your people and make them want to work for your company and do a great job.",1439350951

By ruling based on a), rather than b) (which is how it sounded to me from the write up, but I&#x27;ve no read the detailed judgement), it seems to be  suggesting that chronic stress be the factor that i) prevents competent work, and ii) cannot be accommodated. That seems like a wider judgement than I&#x27;d be happy with. There are plenty of people with chronic stress, as long as they aren&#x27;t threatening people with death, I don&#x27;t see why a company can&#x27;t provide some support and accommodation to help them be productive. The question about advertising is rhetorical: being chronically stressed is not on par with pissing on the bosses desk or dealing meth, or dressing as a nazi. It is on par, I&#x27;d say, with chronic back pain, loss of eyesight, hormonal imbalance.<p>By what standard of determining stress does one judge that an employee is past helping in a case of chronic stress? If the answer is &#x27;you know when they start threatening people with death&#x27;, then it would seem to me like the death threats, not the stress is the key culprit.<p>See what I&#x27;m saying?",1439350118

And this speech, in particular, is something I have spent a lot of time thinking about.<p>> America is today the strongest, the most influential and most productive nation in the world.<p>Still true today, although the &quot;rise of the rest&quot; means that the US is not the absolutely dominant-in-all-arenas country it was a few decades ago. That&#x27;s fine with me personally, as that rise of other countries has meant improved living standards and less poverty for many areas.<p>> we yet realize that America&#x27;s leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.<p>&quot;With great power comes great responsibility&quot;. No argument with President Eisenhower on this one. Power must be used with great discretion and for good purposes.<p>> Any failure traceable to arrogance, or our lack of comprehension or readiness to sacrifice would inflict upon us grievous hurt both at home and abroad.<p>A point that seems to have been largely forgotten in recent years.<p>> A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction.<p>As you would expect from the man that led the most powerful single fighting force in history to that time, Eisenhower understands the value in deterrence. Our arms are indeed mighty. We are developing weapons systems that are the result of integrating applied expertise in just about every technical field. And then we are making huge systems of systems where those weapons systems work together.<p>> Our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime, or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or Korea.<p>It&#x27;s 1961. He&#x27;s talking about a system that has completely changed in seven years (since the end of large scale hostilities in Korea in 1953). What happened during that time? The Department of Defense got its legs underneath it (it was only 13 years old in 1960), the Cold War became the dominant ideological conflict shaping the world, the &quot;Sputnik Shock&quot; resulted in large investments in aerospace, and the space race was on. I wonder what Eisenhower would have made out of the massive changes in the 14 years since the September 11 attacks.<p>>In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the militaryindustrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.<p>The core idea of the speech. I think that Eisenhower&#x27;s warnings weren&#x27;t heeded. The systems he oversaw had a number of positive feedback loops in their design. The biggest feedback loop in Eisenhower&#x27;s time was the cold war. What were the Russians doing? Did they have advantages in technology? Could we counter their weapons systems? Their computer systems? Efforts to answer these questions continually brought technical people and money into the system, which reinforced the system, driving the system even harder. This feedback loop remains largely unchanged, only the language used (&quot;information dominance&quot;) and the targets referred to (terrorists, other large nation states) change.<p>>  But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions.<p>It is a world so vast that no one can really tell you exactly how big it is. The Pentagon cannot even accurately account for how the money that it takes in is spent. And it&#x27;s large at even the smallest scales. You can work in the same building as someone (even a fairly small building) and have zero idea what they&#x27;re working on, because you don&#x27;t need to know.<p>> Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.<p>Something to think about in the current climate of pervasive surveillance.<p>> Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientifictechnological elite.<p>Don&#x27;t worry, Ike, the MIC will eventually give birth to the internet, which will make it even MORE difficult to discern signal from noise and will result in a US citizenry that doesn&#x27;t believe in evolution or anthropogenic climate change. That extends to the elite that runs the country.<p>> As we peer into society&#x27;s future, we -- you and I, and our government -- must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering, for our own ease and convenience, the precious resources of tomorrow.<p>Similarly, I wonder what Ike would have made out of climate change deniers? I doubt, from this language, that he would have been a denier.<p>Eisenhower was right on pretty much all points, but I think that by the time he noticed this, it was already too late to stop. Perhaps if the USSR had collapsed a few decades earlier, there might have been some reason dial down the gain on the feedback loop driving the growth of the MIC.",1439349737

We used to be able to download a sub-10 MB installer, run it, and have a usable installation of Firefox ready for use.<p>The Web Platform advanced a lot in the last few years. A lot has been added to browsers. They are no longer a simple HTML engine with some CSS and bad JS engines. Browsers these days are almost their own operating systems for good and bad. They have so much stuff going on between all the multimedia features, multiple JS engines and compilers, there are lots of stuff going on. Browsers are larger because the Web grew a lot (not in the sense of size but in complexity)<p>> Now we have to choose from the &quot;correct&quot; stream, download a 40 MB or larger installer, run it, change numerous about:config options to allow us to install our own custom unsigned extensions and to disable unwanted functionality that Mozilla has added, manually remove unwanted toolbar buttons, install a number of third-party extensions that also fix additional problems introduced by Mozilla, and in the end we&#x27;re still stuck with a user interface and a user experience that isn&#x27;t very good.<p>Firefox has always been customizable and the about:config feature enables lots of under the hood tweaks that are not possible everywhere. Making Firefox your own its part of what makes it great. Its a browser you can change to suit your needs, thats less common than people think. Your needs are not the same needs of others. As for running your unsigned extension, there will be six versions of Firefox available (stable, unbranded stable, beta, unbranded beta, dev edition and nightly). Of these six, only two will force addon signing. All the others are a tweak away.<p>> Now if we&#x27;re developing extensions, we&#x27;ll have to also jump through more hoops thanks to this signing process. You say it &quot;takes only seconds&quot;, but I&#x27;ve seen enough comments here from other developers saying they&#x27;ve been waiting months for reviews. That&#x27;s not acceptable.<p>Please don&#x27;t mix addon signing with AMO review, they are different process with different objectives. Addon signing happens in seconds because its automated. The signed addon is returned to you in seconds and you&#x27;re free to distribute it as you see fit. Now, if you want to have your addon on AMO then you need to submit to AMO review which may take a long time due to the lack of people and the overall complexity of reviewing that type of code.",1439349688

You start out trying to convince the project you&#x27;re working on, with its existing community, just as you would for some other kind of change.  Calling attention to the problem can also help.  If all else fails, sure, forking the project may potentially be an option to solve the problem (in which case you&#x27;d still need to convince (a subset of) the community around that project to join the fork).  But that&#x27;s not always an available option, depending on the project and the circumstances that lead you to working on it.<p>As for communities, no, &quot;fork it&quot; is not a universal solution to problems within communities, conferences, professional events, and other environments.  But even in cases where the approach finally ends up being to go start new, more welcoming environments, that&#x27;s still a case for codes of conduct and similar; even if you&#x27;re successful in moving a community elsewhere, if the same set (or a new set) of awful people show up with their same behavior, you need something to show what standards a community expects.  And much like the Zen of Python, &quot;explicit is better than implicit&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m also noticing a conspicuous lack of any response to the actual behaviors I was referring to; you&#x27;re dismissing that as behavior that someone ought to have to tolerate or go start their own project.  This problem ought to be as universally recognized in projects as buffer overflows are.  And rather than playing whack-a-mole, it makes sense to try to get better solutions in place.  For instance, getting support from major hosting sites, or otherwise creating larger meta-communities of people who agree that this is a bad idea, to avoid having a different set of standards (or lack of standards) in every project.  And just as it&#x27;s a bad idea to write your own software license rather than using a standard one, it&#x27;s a bad idea to write your own code of conduct rather than using a standard one.",1439349562

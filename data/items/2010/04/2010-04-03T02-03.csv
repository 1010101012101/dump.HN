1238077,comment,1237939,1237939,0,0,lotharbot,,,"1) get a rice cooker, preferably one with a top basket that lets it double as a veggie steamer.  Rice with some veggies and lean meat is fairly healthy, tasty, inexpensive, and requires little active prep time (which is what I assume you mean by ""quick"".)  You may have to cook the meat separately, depending on the type.<p>2) get a slow cooker.  Much of the same applies, only instead of a rice base, use potatoes and/or beans.  This works pretty well with larger portions of meat (chicken is cheap.)  IIRC you can do some pasta dishes in a slow cooker as well.<p>3) For variety, change up the specific mix of veggies, the type of meat (may need to be cooked separately), and the spices in both of the above.  You'd be amazed how different rice with chicken, carrots, onions and potatoes tastes when you spice it with oregano vs. curry powder vs. garlic and ginger.<p>4) Hit up the day-old bread rack, the reduced-price meat section, and so on.  It's a good way to add occasional bits of variety at a low cost.  I also get most of my produce from a small neighborhood produce stand, rather than the big grocery store.<p>5) [EDIT]: one simple dish I've started making on the stovetop recently: Throw some pasta, canned/frozen/fresh-cut veggies, and a can of concentrated soup (tomato, cream of chicken, etc.) in a saucepan with the appropriate amount of water.  Cook it just like you would cook plain pasta.  Again, you can add a bit of meat and change up the spices, veggies, or soup type and have a totally different meal.",1270263429

I eat them fresh, then from the fridge for a day or two, then freeze the rest. Anything flavorful and goopy works (since textures degrade with freezing and reheating).<p>2) Rice cooker. Most useful kitchen appliance I've ever owned. They really are fire and forget. I bought mine for $13 at target. It only has one button (maybe Apple should get into this market?). It's pretty forgiving--I don't even measure the water anymore.<p>3) Whole pre-cooked chickens. They can cost as little as $3 or as much as $10 (for the organic ones). I get 2-4 meals from one chicken depending on its size and what I eat with it. Then I throw the carcass in a pot of water with onions and celery and make soup stock. (Throw away the bones, onions, and celery before making soup).<p>4) Instant oatmeal is the cheapest good breakfast I know of. I use fancy steel cut organic instant oats with organic milk and the cost is around $0.50 per meal. Adding fresh berries brings it to around $1.50.

Hindsight being what it is, you could probably build a Subversion-like system with almost the same filesystem by making the notion of branches and tags first class, and their just-a-copy nature being somewhat hidden from the user.<p>Sadly (on some level, I'm a huge DVCS advocate, but see the need for CVCS in corporate environments), that's largely water under the bridge - many of the original team have moved on to using DVCS tools.

I don't see any reason to have to duplicate their albums, and think it's silly that people have to add all three of us (or look in three places) to see all of our family pictures.  If one of us could make an album and add the other two as co-owners, it would be a lot easier for us to put up family pics.",1270260233

No language, framework or concept has changed my development process more in the past decade.<p>I have been able to contribute patches (both code and documentation) to many projects where I otherwise would have not had the time or energy to bother contributing.<p>Sure, my previous attitude may have been selfish, but if it took an hour to fix a bug in a library that I am using for a throwaway script, I am not going to spend another hour subscribing to mailing lists, emailing developers and then persuading them that my patch is worth merging.<p>In GitHub I just fork, push my patch, and notify the owner of the original repo. If he chooses to pull in the patch, that is his problem. If anyone else who is having the same problem wants to use my repo, they can do so.",1270260153

Both are great sources of protein.<p>When I want to spend a weekend hacking, and don't want to be bothered, I'll cook a big batch of steel cut oats in the slow cooker, starting it on a Friday night. Then I know I can just mix in a few table spoon of the good ""grind it yourself"" peanut butter with a cup or two of oatmeal. It leaves me feeling satiated, and is rather healthy with lots of fiber and protein without much fat, and without sugar.",1270260114

But there's probably 1 Ruby job out there for every 300 .NET and Java jobs, maybe even less. Maybe the Ruby community likes this, I dunno. But for me, it means I've never had a chance, and probably never will have a chance, to really use Ruby in a professional environment.<p>And I can't really blame companies, if I had a company I wouldn't use Ruby either. I generally find .NET is a nice compromise between Ruby's ADD and Java's glacial pace, but that's just me.",1272473974

You do seem to be right that it is not practiced.<p>I had thought I would find counterexamples in places like the Antebellum south, or ancient Rome, and while I found a reduced emphasis on the state, I did not find it completely gone.

Oddly this has not really caught on in the Ruby community, probably because testing requires less thought and people are paid to write test code so why not just relax and write boilerplate CYA code and get paid for it.<p>The 80/20 rule applies to testing, but most people test things like basic ActiveRecord finders, etc.  Why?  Because writing a test of something complex requires a lot of thinking which hurts a bit.<p>In most apps, there is a ""money work flow"", such as signing someone up, taking an order, etc.  If that stops working it's a really big deal.  To adequately test it you probably need integration tests, but most devs don't bother to write that test because it's a pain and it fails a lot during development.<p>I think TDD is a bit of a cop out that can lead to an insufficiently specified API.  If all it takes to make the test pass is to handle a narrow case of inputs, then you should feel no additional confidence just because the test passes.<p>Ideally running a test suite can tell you that the code is safe to deploy... Some tests can also speed up writing other code by making it easy to think through a problem with sample data.<p>If you are writing filler tests, useless tests, etc. just stop and figure out what is actually important.<p>If your unit tests take longer than 60 seconds you are probably doing it wrong.",1272472995

Show the excitement, but keep it short so they don't get bored.<p>As for the queuing models & Petri nets, assuming everyone understood I was a more than a little tongue-in-cheek:<p>- Setup your net as a cycle between weekdays and weekends.  I only use 1 week of forward planning, so my base net is 3 weekdays (I save a few weekdays for non-dating) and 2 weekend days.  5 vertices.<p>- Duplicate the net for different stages, roughly equating one stage per date sequence number.  E.g stage 1 is first date, stage 2 is the second date, etc.<p>- Each girl is a token.<p>- Each token in each stage tells you how your day is likely to go, once you equate the stage # to an expected progress level.  Especially early on in the dating sequence, dates can be short, so multiple dates can be stacked into a day (e.g. an afternoon 1st date vs a dinner/movie 3rd date that night).<p>Nothing fancy by any means.  Note, again, that this is pretty tongue-in-cheek, but it does help me keep a rational (and semi-quantitative) focus on what is fundamentally a numbers game.

But besides for Django which has a) been out for almost as long as Rails and b) uses a great dynamic language, the other camps you mention doesn't have anything resembling the ""Ruby on"" part.<p>Just grabbing the grabbing the general ideas of Rails are trying to fit them into less expressive languages yields some less than desirable results. Have you actually looked and compared any of the code back and forth?<p>2) Hahaha. The web has been pronounced dead on more occasions that I can count, but RIA has been the boogeyman since the beginning of the last decade. Don't invest your piggybank in it happening this time.<p>Additionally, I know of lots of Rails apps that are using all those technologies for the front end. Whether your output is HTML or Flash or whatever, you're going to need a backend to handle it. All the benefits of Ruby, Active Record, Action Mailer, and the works are as relevant as ever with that.<p>3. What does this even mean?!<p>Anyway, good luck betting.",1272470865

Minimal viable, clear path to revenue, useful, potentially viral, easy for merchants to start using, expandable as a revenue-sharing service that other web sites can embed.  Chief assets are (1, the lesser) the web site tech;  (2, the greater) the personal relationships with the merchants (3, the future potential) partnerships with other on-line properties.  Asset 2, if you can keep up the momentum, makes it hard to replicate and asset 3 seals that deal and can also help with rates of coupon use.  It looks promising to me.<p>The web site design has two jarring aspects that I think you ought to fix:<p>(a) It is annoying as heck the way when you switch categories (e.g., click on ""Food"" or ""Health"") the ""Just launched"" section disappears and then re-appears in an animated way.   It's <i>really</i> annoying - it looks like a bug even though it's probably on purpose.<p>(b) You've got ""Deals"" and ""Merchants"" links.  That's crazy talk.   Normal people don't say ""merchants"" - only business people.   When I wanted to know ""How does one advertise on this site"" I saw a ""Merchants"" link and thought ""Aha!  That'll say it!""  No... that's not it at all.  The link I wanted is in fine print (""Merchant Accounts"").<p>The fine print is fine at the top of the page like that, I think.  But the big ""Merchants"" link needs a better name - something more consumer friendly.   Maybe ""Deals"" and ""Business Directory"" or ""Today's Deals"" / ""Business Directory"".",1272470724

I don't regret saying it either.<p>Fast forward a month and I begin working on a pre-profit project that is so bloated with tests and unnecessary complexity that it took me a few days to really figure out what the hell was going on with the code.  When I first started reviewing the code, I was thinking, ""Wow, this guy's testing chops make me feel stupid."".  Then, after really spending some time with the code, I just thought, ""WTF!?"".<p>It's clear he spent much more time writing tests than writing any features.  On top of that, he had written 10 level deep abstractions for features that had features for their feature's features.  In order to really understand the insanity of this you have to know that this site basically had 0 users and was going nowhere fast.<p>Then I was just pissed.  Pissed at the thought of someone just getting paid to implement every feature under the sun without questioning if any of it was really necessary and with 0 user feedback.  This is one of those instances where the developer makes thousands of dollars and the site and owner just lose thousands.  This is totally unacceptable and irresponsible in my opinion.<p>The first thing I did was start removing features and didn't write one test for anything.  I would have loved to just scrap the whole code base and start over, but there just wasn't time so I just had to rewrite as I went.  You would think with all those fantastic tests, the code would be pretty solid, but I continually found incongruencies and errors.  The database didn't even have foreign key constraints set up for any of the relationships.  Why bother using a relational database?<p>I know that TDD is popular and I've seen job descriptions like ""If you are just getting started with tests, don't even bother."", but I think there are a lot of developers wasting a huge amount of time and money writing tests for products that are destined to fail, partially because of all the time and money spent writing tests.",1272470667

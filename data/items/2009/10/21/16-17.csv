It's possible that it's very far away in phase space from a truly killer flu, but it's also possible that it's only a couple of mutations away from becoming deadly.<p>Since flu mutates fast, any truly novel strain that reaches pandemic status represents a serious threat.  Fortunately this kind of leap only happens every few decades; unfortunately, we have no defense against it.<p>An interesting article covering this point: <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/04/swine_flu_i_beat_a_dead_horse.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/04/swine_flu_i_be...</a>",1256144327

There's an ideal level of immigration - go too high over it, and it leads to overcrowding, social upheaval, displacement.  Go too low, and a society stagnates.<p>It's not just about numbers, of course, it's also about the type of immigrant.  While it may be politically incorrect to say so, migrant farm workers who send most of their earnings home may very well result in a net loss, whereas highly educated workers result in a net gain.<p>The issue is so intense in the US that I think it's productive to ask how you'd design an immigration system for a smaller country with lower population density.  Right now, New Zealand has a population of about 4 mil and a land mass only a bit smaller than California.<p>Would New Zealanders be better off if fifty million immigrants came into the country over the next 20 years?

More people with flu symptoms are going to the hospital and being diagnosed with flu, whereas in the past, they stayed home and got better.<p>All because of bullshit reporting like this:<p><a href=""http://www.krem.com/topstories/stories/krem2-102009-flu-death.237ef85fb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.krem.com/topstories/stories/krem2-102009-flu-deat...</a><p>A women felt ill.  Then felt a little better.  Then got ill again within a few days and died in the Hospital overnight.<p>Without even CONFIRMING that it was Swine Flu, they are reporting it like it is, and they are scaring up everyone in town to think that if they have a tickle in their throat they are going to die in 3 days.",1256141034

894901,comment,894746,894856,0,0,cynicalkane,,,"What's worse is that point--that banks profit off spreads--doesn't actually do harm to consumers. It's the long-term lending, short-term borrowing structure of banks that enables them to offer higher interest rates than the market short-term interest rates. That's how banks came about: people got higher interest by pooling their money with money-lenders than they did lending money themselves. Both the consumers and the bankers capture some surplus. Welcome to free trade.<p>You don't have to take my word for it. Compare the rates on short to medium-term CDs with the rates offered by Treasuries. Both of these have the same risk to the consumer, but which offer higher interest?<p>(Some CDs have excessive withdrawal penalties. Go to a bank that doesn't have this, or use brokered CDs.)",1256140990

But maybe Chinese will have the critical mass to overcome this problem. Not good enough for corporate usage, but maybe sufficient for teenagers who care about computers and not talking to foreigners, so want to start out hacking without having to learn English at the same time.<p>(Also I guess it's just sheer dumb luck that Chinese word order and English order are roughly similar enough that something like ZhPy or astine's IDE idea above is basically just an exercise in keyword substitution. Doing that kind of translation in head-final languages like Tamil or Japanese would just result in even more mind-bending than leaving it in English --- e.g. in those languages the equivalent of ""from/to"" refers to the preceding word, not the following one, e.g. ""morning from night to"").",1256140844

2378821,comment,2364922,2375355,1,0,sofal,,,"I don't know if you're trying to denounce the scientific theory of evolution or if the question you're really trying to get at is, ""What is the universally applicable cosmic meaning of our existence?"" If it's the latter. then I'd suggest to you that the problem lies in the question.<p>As far as your <i>past</i> versus <i>present</i> comments go, I cannot tell whether your indulging in philosophical navel gazing about the Problem of Induction, or if you actually have a particular scientific theory in mind that you think doesn't stand up to the evidence. In the former case, you can quickly reason that accepting any scientific principle takes as much faith as picking your nose, which renders the conversation meaningless and contradicts your given definition of faith to begin with. After all, you don't know that the universe wasn't created 15 seconds ago with all of our memories intact. If it's the latter case, and you really believe that there are some important underlying assumptions in a specific area of science that scientists have not stated up front, then I think the best thing to do would be to contribute your insights to the scientific community by writing a paper on it. If you can demonstrate previously unknown shortcomings in a widely accepted scientific theory, then you will be listened to and heralded. If you cannot, then your vague accusations that scientists overstate their assumptions and thereby use ""faith"" to back up their research are baseless.",1301327904
2378820,comment,2377779,2377779,6,0,tzs,,,"Drepper was correct to close the bug, but for the wrong reason. The correct reason to close the bug is that the original version (the one that produces the non-uniform distribution of permutations) is how the function is documented as working. From the strfry man page:<p><pre><code>    strfry creates a pseudorandom anagram of a string, replacing
    the input with the anagram in place. For each position in the
    string, strfry swaps it with a position in the string selected
    at random (from a uniform distribution).
</code></pre>
This only produces a uniform distribution of permutations if n^n/n! is an integer, where n is the length of the string. This is only true for n = 1 and n = 2.<p>(At least that is what the current man page says...I don't know if it said that in 2007 when the bug was filed).",1301327886

North America lags parts of Europe and Asia by a wide margin, but I fail to see how the US is ahead of Canada.<p>Rural areas here are often underserved and it's no secret we are probably as bad as the US on that front. But worse? I doubt it.<p>My family in Barnwell, Alberta (pop. 600) has at least DSL these days, and possibly even cable, delivering streaming video and all that without any trouble. There are more remote locations so maybe it's not representative but it's the only info I have personally verified on that.<p>I live in BC and use Shaw's network to transfer at least 100 gigs per month, every month, at about 15mbps down and about 0.5 to 2 mbps up (like everyone else in North America). This costs $40/mo or something like that. I've done this for over 7 years and have received exactly 1 email from Shaw to inform me that I'm exceeding my limit. The email politely asked that I not do so and I ignored it without hearing anything further.<p>When mobile I use my phone as a 3G modem tethering my notebook and/or iPad to it using BlueTooth or WiFi. I have 6 GB of transfer each month and regularly use 2 to 6 GB each month. Speeds are pretty good at around 2 to 3 mbps down and something typically abysmal up. I pay $20/mo for the data service.<p>I have a choice in service on both fronts. Not enough choice for my liking, but a choice nonetheless.<p>So how is Canada worse than the US? I think we need to establish that the situation is indeed poorer here than in the US before we ask why.<p>Looks like the % of population online is similar: <a href=""http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats14.htm#north"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats14.htm#north</a><p>Any other relevant data on this?",1301327829

OP was comparing number of IPs in IPv4 with number of people on earth.  Since we are only just now starting to run out of IPv4 addresses (the last big blocks were assigned recently, but there are still gaps and sparsely filled blocks), it seems safe to say that <i>on average</i> the number of IP enabled devices is lower than the number of people.  That won't last long though.<p>As technology filters down to the third world, and (assuming there isn't some massive device convergence that reduces demand for IPs in the first world) the ratio of devices to people will rapidly become skewed.

Check out and comment on one of my mini projects:<p>http://coderqr.com<p>It's a website for the QR-uninitiated crowd to quickly make QR bar codes and move on with their lives, with plenty of options to satisfy most everyone.<p>The site came about when I tried to make QR bar codes for the business cards at my job. There wasn't a single site out there that allows you to enter multiple phone numbers, emails, urls, etc. I did some research into the data format, found out it's a bunch of text markup code, and so I was able to get the right data into the bar codes. Then, I built coderqr.com to make everyone else's life easier. The user can also embed other types of data besides contact info. There's plain text (which, with the right markup, allows you to generate every other type of embedded data), urls, email addresses, email messages, sms messages, even map coordinates. For the unaware, when you scan a qr bar code, you can open the right app for the given data. For example, if there's an email message embedded in a bar code, when you scan it, you'll be able to launch the email app and the To, Subject, and Body fields will all be filled in with the data from the code. All you have to do is press send. I can envision Washington DC plastered with QR code ads where you just scan the code, press send on the email, and off it goes to your senators and other representatives.<p>There's nothing too fancy on the backend: it uses Google's Charts API to generate the image. Further down the line, I'll generate my own images. That way, I'll be able to add custom designs with curves and colors, so the codes won't looks so blocky and sterile.<p>I've used this project as a bit of a learning lesson in SEO and advertising revenue. Up next, I'll add affiliate links to put the codes on tshirts, mugs, and other objects.<p>Anyways, long story short, I'd love to hear your thoughts!",1301326696

He makes the argument that ""men's rights"" (and implicitly ""women's rights"") discussions are emotional, and he's right.</i><p>Where's the proof?  And if it is emotional and bad nor good arguments are influencing he's simply Glen Beck pandering to a group that simply agrees with him already and inflaming those that don't?  If that's the case then bravo for him (and Glen Beck).  But then what did he expect then?<p>You can't argue that this is an emotional issue, emotional issues create a certain response, and good arguments aren't influential -- and then feign surprise when exactly what you state happens.  IMO that's a sign of either genius PR at work (ala Beck) or one with poor character (ala Beck).<p><i>Again, I don't see this interpretation. As I read it, he says that he believes people can't be convinced by evidence to change a position... and it turns out he's right: <a href=""http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/07/11/.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/07/11/...</a>.  </i><p>That means there is no right and wrong, as far as humans are concerned.  But furthermore the study actually shows why Adams' position is INCORRECT!  The study shows that people who are presented with misinformation have potential to cling to this, even in the face of correction.  This strongly argues that we should avoid misinformation in the first place NOT to distribute it equally (or worse even more abudantly, since one can generate more distinct false statements than true statements).<p>And of course read the actual paper where they say,<p><i>Its important to note that the account provided above does not imply that individuals simply believe what they want to believe under all circumstances and never accept counter-attitudinal information. Per Ditto and Lopez (1992: 570), preference-inconsistent information is likely to be subjected to greater skepticism than  preference-consistent
information, but individuals who are confronted with information of
sufficient quantity or clarity should eventually acquiesce to a preference-inconsistent
conclusion. The effectiveness of corrective information is therefore likely to vary
depending on the extent to which the individual has been exposed to similar messages
elsewhere. For instance, as a certain belief becomes widely viewed as discredited among
the public and the press, individuals who might be ideologically sympathetic to that belief
will be more likely to abandon it when exposed to corrective information.</i><p>Again, this shows Adams' position as wrong.  And also shows why the dissemination of misinformation is bad in that it makes it more difficult for misinformation to be abandoned.<p>Additionally from the study: <i>Currently, all of our backfire results come from conservatives  a finding that may provide support for the hypothesis that conservatives are especially dogmatic</i> -- although they concede that more work is needed here as they don't have sufficient evidence.  But given that Adams's position is historical conservative, I do wonder if evidence against it will simply inspire the backfire effect.<p>But with all that said, I'm sure I'm wasting my time writing this since any argument, even from your own sources, surely won't change your mind in the slightest.  It will in fact likely just strengthen your current position -- especially on something so emotional.",1301326159

Also, the worst thing that can happen to an extension like LIMIT is that more rows show up than expected, but that wouldn't change the context of the original query to return data that wasn't originally intended to be shown.  Plus, it would be very difficult to tag on more SQL to a direct LIMIT number being passed in unless the back-end application was totally brain-dead about how it converted strings to integers.<p>One other thing - extensions like LIMIT <i>can</i> be parameterized also (shameless plug: our product ElevateDB can do it with its RANGE clause).

(Technically, append-at-head and delete-from-tail only.)<p>Do you handle this by breaking the DB up into multiple small files, like BDB-JE?<p>> The code keeps track of how much garbage is present and keeps a running tally of how much garbage collection it ""owes"" based on maintaining a long-term optimal GC rate. When that value is large enough, it looks for some old pages to clean.<p>How long-term is that? I assume you have considered the degenerate case, where load is increasing linearly (instead of more common daily/weekly/etc. cycles) and garbage collection falls behind. In context of your next answer, it seems like this case would cause the GC to get starved out, leading to higher IO requirements for queries, leading to less time to GC, and so on to failure.<p>Granted, you would have to be running very hot for this to happen, but its possible.<p>One more question: Have you considered implementing in-memory locking/synchronisation (like a shared mutex)? Offering test-and-set type operations is a nice alternative to full-fledge transactions for many use cases. If these are just used as synchronisation primitives then fsyncing them every time seems wasteful, on the assumption that many use cases don't care about lock durability across server failure.",1301325368

2378605,comment,2378227,2378369,9,0,crikli,,,"No, it doesn't, market forces are devaluing the design industry.<p>Designers, especially web designers, are working in a highly saturated market.  Even in the rural area where I live, I constantly meet designers who want to be in the running for the contracts my firm awards.  The low barriers to entry and the seductiveness of the industry have created a situation where many folks are claiming to be designers.<p>Furthermore, designers are  working in a field that requires a unique blend of talents.  It's not enough just to be artistically talented and proficient with design tools.  The key ability a designer must demonstrate is to be able to, via conversation, grasp the vision that a client has and translate that into a coherent design that provides a fluid user experience.<p>With so many parties competing for the same business that key ability is the deciding factor as to whether you'll get work or you won't.<p>If it's my firm and you're new to us, you're going to have to prove that you have the aforementioned key ability.  And that means...steady yourself...spec work.  Not much, mind you, and not more than is necessary, but enough to prove that you're not just another wannabe with an artistic bent and a Mac.<p>Don't worry, we're not getting free design work because if we're going use your work, you're getting the gig.  If you don't get the gig, it's because your work doesn't cut it.<p>If that's too much to stomach, no problem.  I'll grab the next designer's business card off of an ever-growing stack.",1301324998

This is not XBMC Lite, it is the full package you know from the desktop. Add a NAS for movies, music and TV Shows and you have a very good solution. It's impressive that the underpowered Apple TV is able to play 1080p content flawlessly, however while being able to play 1080p the Apple TV scales everything down to 720p - this seems to be a hardware design decision which can't be changed, the XBMC team is looking into it. Given that I use a 720p beamer it isn't a problem for me though.

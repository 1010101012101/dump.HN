There&#x27;s a group there called PAG (Portfolio Analytics Group), made up of mostly fresh college graduates. In the beginning, the head of the program would feed us the Kool-Aid about how the long 16 hour days would be so worth it after a year or 2. Sure, we&#x27;d be half-awake when we came in at 6 AM, and half-dead when we got to leave at 10 PM.<p>The kicker was he told us while it&#x27;d be tempting to just go home and sleep after we left, we should instead head straight to the GYM and workout for 30 mins, then go to the bar for a few hours because it would keep our &quot;sanity&quot;.

It really only works as an adjective for an entire diet. If someone already consumes way too much vitamin C, more vitamin C is definitely not healthy. And yet for a sailor who hasn&#x27;t seen greens in months, it definitely is. So, nothing can really be seen as healthy in isolation, the context is essential.<p>So then, the correct question is &quot;Is a diet of only Soylent healthy?&quot; Even here we run into some pretty significant trouble: nutrition is not a developed enough science to really answer that question yet. We don&#x27;t have a good metric of healthiness, even for an entire diet. What we can do, though, is make comparisons. We can ask if a diet of only Soylent is healthier than a diet of only rocks. That one&#x27;s a pretty easy yes. More meaningfully, we can ask if a diet of only Soylent is healthier than a diet of only fast food. I&#x27;m confident that it is, but this is where the disagreement begins. Unfortunately, this stuff is hard to test. Forcing someone to eat nothing but fast food for an experiment would be completely unethical, and observing people who already only eat fast food would be subject to some really significant sampling bias.<p>This has all been a long-winded way of saying that there&#x27;s no way to know, yet. I would strongly argue that adult consumers should be free to experiment with their diet as long as they do it responsibly. There are definitely some moral and legal gray areas here (&#x27;experimenting with your diet&#x27; by downing a bottle of pills is still attempted suicide).<p>I think it&#x27;s highly likely that a diet of only Soylent is quite a bit healthier than the diet I&#x27;m currently eating (way more fast food and take out than I should, for a variety of reasons).

So it&#x27;s not even true to say that conventional bombing wouldn&#x27;t have killed civilians; every pilot who went on a bombing mission, conventional or nuclear, knew that they were killing civilians too.<p>And both Hiroshima and Nagasaki had actual military value, it&#x27;s not as if either of them were resort villages.

It&#x27;s not a matter of simply ferrying a bunch of people over the Trans-Siberian railroad, you also need a navy, sufficient air cover (which if I remember my geography correctly would have almost necessarily meant carrier-borne aircraft), and the logistics to back that all up. Japan knew this just as much then as we realize it now.<p>The Soviet gains after their entry into the war were in China and Korea, not in Japan itself. Their entrance into the war was earlier than expected on the Japanese&#x27;s part, but they knew the U.S.S.R. would declare war (seriously, you may consider their senior and military leadership stupid, but <i>that</i> stupid?).<p>Likewise the attack on the Kwantung Army in China was surprising in that it came from every direction possible instead of the one direction they expected it from. But they knew the Soviets would attack, and in fact the attack fell while the Kwantung Army was changing positions to better guard the direction they believed the attack would actually come from.<p>So certainly the Soviet attack came as a shock, but it was militarily no more severe than any other setback to the Allies.<p>> but outside of the US the majority agree that the USSR caused the surrender.<p>Don&#x27;t take this the wrong way, but what does an opinion poll have to do with whether some event actually happened in a given way or not? It either did or did not happen for the causes described. If the rest of the world has better <i>evidence</i> for their belief then point to the evidence, but don&#x27;t point to an opinion poll as prima facie evidence of something.<p>In the event we have evidence on the Japanese side that the atomic bomb proved a useful &quot;excuse&quot; to permit the Emperor to surrender. The Japanese were clearly ready to fight to the death (just witness the Battle of Okinawa), and that applied just as much against the Red Army as it did against the Americans. So simply changing the uniform of the person holding the rifle wouldn&#x27;t have significantly affected the strategic calculus when the Emperor had to explain his decision to his people.<p>On the other hand, the atomic bomb was this technological doomsday device that even the most hardened Japanese militant couldn&#x27;t speak against. You couldn&#x27;t fight it in the battlefield; you couldn&#x27;t simply hunker down like a brave citizen and start picking up pieces after the bombs had been dropped, now there were no pieces left to pick up at all.<p>Japan had nothing like it, and as such it gave the Emperor a clear line of reasoning for why he had to (<i>had to</i>) surrender for the sake of his people.

Not after a very small interval of time, but absolutely instantaneously. As in zero time elapses between dropping and falling.<p>> This is fairly earthshaking, really.

I don&#x27;t understand why people expect that there has to be an interaction before gravity starts, or that gravity is directed linearly between two masses (you and the earth).  It&#x27;s already being emitted, and you&#x27;re stepping out off the cliff into a gravity wave that is already there.  You&#x27;re always in that wave.  Now the thing beneath you preventing you from being pulled in is gone.  No initial setup was required.<p>Imagine the same example with a light beam instead of gravity.   At the foot of the cliff is a ball as bright as the surface of the sun, radiating light in every which way.  If you step off the cliff, it doesn&#x27;t take a few nanoseconds for the light to hit you, because you&#x27;re stepping into a lightbeam that is already there.  No interaction is necessary to set it up.<p>I dunno.  This seems like the intuitive way to think about it to me.  Anything else would seem strange. Maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding?",1377130902

He just protected Dick Cheney, who - semantics aside - was likely the actual leaker (in terms of responsibility for the leak and directing that the leak occur).",1377129669

6254138,comment,6253684,6253684,2,0,dholowiski,,,"> fastest and cheapest high quality<p>As the old saying goes, pick any two (or sometimes just one)<p>I used to produce high quality video tutorials. I used &quot;Screenflow&quot; from Telestream. I had a professional quality Shure microphone and an audio mixer, as well as a USB sound card. Probably the most important component is your audio, much more so than video quality, so spend some money on good quality audio equipment.<p>I pre-planned my tutorials, recorded the tutorials and then edited them. For editing, I did most of it in Final Cut Pro, although I was eventually able to do it all in Screenflow. I spent a huge time editing - synching audio and video, recording parts where I messed up.<p>All told, for a 20 minute tutorial I would probably spend an hour planning, 40 minutes recording, 3 hours editing, and 2 or 3 hours encoding the video. The encoding part would probably go much faster on today&#x27;s hardware, but the 2 or 3 hours editing was the result of many hours of learning - it was probably 8 or 9 hours to edit the first ones.<p>If you&#x27;re recording screencasts, I wholeheartedly recommend screenflow. Without a doubt it&#x27;s the best screencast software there is (not an ad, just a happy customer).",1377129642

Likewise the trials are overseen in the end by the civilian Supreme Court.<p>In the actual military the untoward influence (real or perceived) of the convening officer on the outcome of the case is a B.F.D., just witness all the sexual assault/harassment cases that were being upended by Obama&#x27;s condemnation of servicemembers who engage in them. In fact SECDEF himself had to issue a memo saying, in effect, that the POTUS expects trial members/judges to use their own independent judgment when considering the facts of a case, just as specified in the M.C.M.<p>You&#x27;re right that an independent actor is what is needed in general, but Col. Lind does not report to the President on this, she reports to the Commanding General of the Military District of Washington, which is a completely separate chain of command from the one that was issuing orders relating actions in Iraq of Afghanistan.",1377129630

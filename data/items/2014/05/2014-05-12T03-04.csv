Microsoft didn&#x27;t even have a dog in the fight (remember they were &quot;blindsided&quot; by the internet). You signed up for internet access with Earthlink or Juno or some other company like that and they sent you a CD with a free copy of Netscape.<p>Microsoft licensed the Mosaic browser from Spyglass and that became IE. As you pointed out, they developed IE until it was a better browser. The Netscape stagnation happened when they had a long delay in releases due to their undertaking a &quot;thing you should never do [1],&quot; a from-scratch rewrite. Around that time the 2000/2001 dot-com collapse happened which certainly didn&#x27;t help, but Microsoft didn&#x27;t cause any of that.<p>Fast-forward a decade, and now Microsoft is stagnant. Apple developed WebKit and Safari, and Google came along with Chrome, a better browser. By the time Microsoft worked its way through IE 6-7-8 to a browser that was actually competitive again, they had lost a lot of their browser share. Apple, with Safari, and Firefox, rising from the ashes of Netscape, also offered compelling alternatives.<p>&quot;Who&#x27;da thunk it.&quot; Well I&#x27;m not sure.

I was just making a general comment about a perceived anti-capitalist bias in these forums.<p>&quot;Any market left to its own devices will devolve into a monopoly.&quot; This is not an observable phenomenon. A market left to its own devices will continually deliver better, cheaper products to its customers over time. This is the effect competition has on a marketplace.<p>&quot;Businesses left to themselves will raise the barriers to market thereby making the market non-free in Smith&#x27;s terms.&quot; If a business is not using physical force or fraud then the only barriers they can erect to keep out competitors are superior offerings in the marketplace.<p>Microsoft is such a great example here. Their competitors were crying monopoly but Microsoft had created its marketshare through innovation and entrepreneurship. If they abuse this marketshare by offering inferior products at high prices, it creates a market opportunity for another competitor to create better products at more attractive prices. In this sense it&#x27;s the free consumer choice that&#x27;s providing the &quot;regulation&quot; in the market. Businesses have to follow the consumer&#x27;s wants to gain marketshare.<p>The only government &quot;regulatory&quot; role in a market is to settle disputes about property or fraud or criminal behavior.

Maybe someday they&#x27;ll replace more of it, but there are still several fixed function stages in the rendering pipeline.<p>Not to mention, setting GPU state will pretty much always be completely independent from shaders, and required for many visual effects. D3D or CG FX files try to abstract this, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re popular anymore.<p>> For the most part, building an API higher-level than OpenGL also means dictating a particular scene graph structure...<p>The general premise that any layer on top of the driver will limit on the way you structure the renderer is accurate, but scene graphs are an antipattern inside a modern renderer.

It makes no sense to build out massive cellular networks in triplicate.<p>I agree with you, but I also think that it makes no sense to grant access to the airwaves at the same time as granting a monopoly to all services that might be performed over those airwaves. I think that this effectively extends the monopoly into other areas that are not natural.<p>In the UK, the incumbent telecoms company (BT) is <i>required</i> by the regulator to provide access to its lines to companies that compete with them. The (regulatory) agreed pricing is relatively close to BT&#x27;s own cost structure (95 percentile billing, etc). This is just for the part that is the natural monopoly - primarily the last mile. The competition provide their own Internet backhaul, and sometimes the links to the exchanges too. I think this works remarkably well - the market has real competition in providing all of the other parts of Internet service (customer service, peering quality, how different ISPs end up managing their bandwidth, etc).<p>With no history, I think it might be even better to limit companies granted rights to the natural monopoly area to only providing services to other businesses for access only. For example: a company granted access to cellphone frequencies might only be permitted to provide transit to other companies, rather than to retail customers directly. I think that by replacing the irrational retail customers with more rational businesses, we&#x27;d get better efficiency, real competition and prices closer to real cost.",1399865228

(not to be confused with logic inverters)<p>A typical inverter uses MOSFET or IGBT transistors to switch a DC voltage which is then fed through a capacitor as a form  of isolation. Typical inverters are use on Solar panel systems to convert PV cells energy into AC, battery backup to AC (Uniinterruptible power supplies), or single phase to multiphase AC to drive AC motors efficiently.<p>One of the reasons they are &quot;big&quot; is because typically they operate at 60 or 50 hz, and at those frequencies if you are using magnetic fields for isolation (like you would if you drove one side of a transformer) the transformers are annoyingly large and hard to make efficient. [1] Many modern inverter start with 280 - 480v DC and use a series of transistors to create an approximation of a sine wave (this is how the cheesy plug into your car lighter inverters usually work). Once you get above a 100W it starts to get a bit more difficult to do cheaply and with reasonable efficiency.<p>Efficiency drains are also present in the upscaling the voltage (whether your using a boost switching circuit or a simple diode/capacitor pump). So getting these things to be efficient is hard, and they are of course generally fairly large per watt.<p>I suspect Google is looking for something to invert PV solar arrays, but high density power conversion is always valuable.<p>[1] That said, a lot of people made high voltage supplies out of using a 555 to switch a transistor on and off which fed the &#x27;low&#x27; side of a power supply transformer.

If you expected the studio to have failed due to Travis Knight&#x27;s leadership, then you have to credit him with it not failing. You can&#x27;t set up predictions in which one result confirms you but the opposite result means you don&#x27;t have to update your assumptions.

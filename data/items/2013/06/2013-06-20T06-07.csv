Again and again, Microsoft has persisted in their delusion that the trademark &quot;Windows&quot; somehow holds value in consumer space.   The Windows brand has yet to earn them a dime&#x27;s worth of consumer attention or goodwill, but Ballmer keeps humping the chicken.  He just <i>knows</i> that there&#x27;s a golden egg in there, somewhere amongst all those feathers.<p>The only thing &quot;Windows&quot; means to the consumer is the certainty that, whenever they see the term come up at work, for whatever reason, in whatever context, they are going to have to call the helpdesk.

5910633,comment,5910352,5910352,20,0,mtgx,,,"Nokia is doing so badly with WP8 even Microsoft doesn&#x27;t want them. What does that tell you about their current strategy?<p>I&#x27;ve always believed, and I still think it would be true - if Nokia would adopt Android, they could probably even beat Samsung. It would&#x27;ve certainly been true if they did it 2-3 years ago, before Samsung got a chance to become the king of smartphones, but I think it can still happen if they do it now, and wait 2-3 years for it to happen. Obviously it won&#x27;t happen overnight, but at least they have a shot at it with Android.<p>They&#x27;ll <i>never</i> do it with WP8. The math just doesn&#x27;t add up. They&#x27;ll always be limited by the WP ecosystem and the WP market share. Samsung has 30% of the smartphone market, which is about 40% of the Android market share.<p>Nokia will have at most 50% of the <i>WP market share</i>. It only has more now because the market is very tiny, but that would change if WP market grew. That means that for Nokia to beat Samsung, WP will need to get to 60% of the smartphone market share, and it means beating Android in market share. WP will never get that much market share, and even the most optimistic (and I believe, unrealistic) predictions by research firms put WP at 20% - <i>5 years from now</i>.<p>So if Nokia wants to stop being more than a niche smartphone player in the future, they&#x27;ll have no choice but to at least also adopt Android. It&#x27;s the right strategy for the Nokia board to pick. They just seem to be very stubborn about it, just like they were too stubborn to fire the Nokia CEO before Elop, for <i>4 years</i> after the iPhone launched. The Nokia board needs to smarten up if they don&#x27;t want to make an almost fatal mistake once again. Or the shareholders need to overhaul the board. One of the two needs to happen.",1371711511

The essence of the bill was that, if one of these bullies sent an unfounded cease and desist letter that failed to explicitly cite its legal basis and was aimed at a company for whom full legal procedures would have had a significant financial impact, it would be assimilated as blackmail and treated accordingly. Blackmail is treated fairly seriously by the legal system, and makes quite the reputation. Do you think this could be a solution for cases like these?<p>Alternatively, how about the possibility of allowing small companies to demonstrate that they cannot withstand the costs of a trial upfront, in which case the trial would be paid for by the state; if the trial is lost, the owners pay (fair enough...). Otherwise, the state can get its money back from the damages paid by the suing company.",1371711446

5910609,comment,5910026,5910026,1,0,jread,,,"I believe these statements are sidestepping the facts. Explicit requests for user data and backdoor access are a separate issue. If Prism involves capturing and storing packets at major Internet backbones (perhaps just upstream from private networks like Google&#x27;s), anything plaintext could be searched and extracted after the fact - email messages, web browsing, chat, etc. To this day, a significant amount of communication related Internet traffic is not encrypted. I&#x27;ve worked on software that does exactly this. Here is a public marketing writeup:<p>&quot;Every packet is recorded, classified, and indexed, making quick discovery, reconstruction, and delivery of files in their original formats easy and intuitive. Reconstruct email attachments, windows file transfers, PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and more, giving you full visibility into everything on your network.... Show all activity over time for a single user or all file-type activity over time for all users.&quot;<p>NSA could apply simple port based filtering to limit capture to only those packets related to communication, thereby streamlining storage requirements. If this was the Prism architecture, then these company statements would be truthful, but misleading. The NSA does not have direct access to their systems or user data, but if the NSA is allowed to record user traffic before it enters, or after it leaves their doors, then the end result is similar.",1371710902

Exports have been falling and the trade surplus has shrunk, and global demand is still weak. Instead, the government is focusing on investment/capital flows. With a strengthening RMB, flows/hot money is less likely to leave the country and the government is actively courting capital inflows.

Active MITM of connections, or really intrusive requests to companies, seems unlikely.<p>This is <i>not</i> the case for China, Israel, etc., so they are far far more likely to use external or internal attacks (other than legal) to get data from companies.

I feel that MS&#x27;s Xbox division has forgotten, when they chose to focus on the publishers instead of the consumer and developer, that price is what makes DRM stores like Audible ($15 or less for audiobooks that normally cost $25-$50) or iOS (most games are 0.99 or FREE compared to 19.99-29.99 for mobile games on other platforms) successful. Price is also what keeps people coming back to Steam.<p>> On the flipside, their no self-publish policy and required publisher agreements<p>This is something else I don&#x27;t understand. It&#x27;s easy to see that self-publishing is what made Apple, Google, and Valve app stores so successful. MS even has a Win 8 app store. I don&#x27;t understand how they couldn&#x27;t see that this should apply to Xbox as well when both Sony and Nintendo already realize this. Why cater to large video game publishers when their days are numbered due to the app stores?",1371708221

I feel like it is a language that I could really love.<p>Clojure is still a bit alien to me. I&#x27;ve gone through tutorials and have built small dummy programs. I feel like this language can make me improve more as an overall programmer. However, I am still skeptical if it will benefit me as much as go.<p>I&#x27;m attracted to both languages because I&#x27;m trying to improve on my knowledge of concurrent/parallel programming.<p>Any reasons to choose one over the other as my next language?

If you used Cedar or white oak you would be able to target the outdoor items without really changing much in your automation (at least I wouldn&#x27;t think so), you may just need to adjust your finishing process. On top of that, it would allow you to have another way to broaden the looks of your products and charge a little more. In my mind Oak is more costly than Maple which you could use to your advantage by adding extra costs to that product.<p>I would have one suggestion too, take off the Disqus comments from the page.

Criminal abuse enabled by proxying to the open web is not high up on their radar. Regular web sites can easily block Tor. But hidden services are unique. When Tor is mentioned in the media, it&#x27;s almost always because of hidden services. When it&#x27;s involved in large scale FBI investigations, it&#x27;s almost always because of hidden services.<p>So whilst Andy Greenberg&#x27;s article is correct, it&#x27;s correct in a nitpicky technical sense that isn&#x27;t going to have any political impact as an argument. Tor has chosen to support hidden services very strongly, so the fact that it&#x27;s a relatively small amount of their total traffic doesn&#x27;t matter much.<p>The Tor project <i>needs</i> to take this kind of thing seriously. Alarm bells should be ringing. They are getting (apparently credible?) tipoffs about plans to seize directory authorities. Relays actually are getting seized. DoJ officials are publicly saying they perceive Tor as being dominated by crime. Meanwhile they are doubling down and making blog posts that describe police operations as &quot;attacks&quot;. This has the feeling of a slow motion train wreck in the making.",1422460603

Zuck&#x27;s recent catering to autocratic, theocratic, and dictator-led regimes is concerning.

A site like Pinterest should optimize for speed, regardless of what Google says.<p>If you turn back an experiment meant to enhance usability and engagement, you show that you care more for search engines than for search engine users. You are of course free to place your priorities so that your business survives, but then you can&#x27;t make a claim to the woes of a whitehat SEO and you will drown in a turmoil of mystification and algo update-fears.<p>I do not understand why they even experiment with javascript rendering to increase the page-speed when they do not even currently defer loading of javascript to </body>. There are a lot of requests that could be combined into a single request and they could save over 50%(!) of the resource size by minifying html and lossless compression of the pinned images on pinimg.com. The mobile site gets a pagespeed score of 58 / 100. This could be 90+ / 100. It should be 90+ / 100 before you even think of javascript rendering. And if you go down that route, better study WAI-ARIA, before you make your site inaccessible to some. Good SEO follows from good design, good development, good content strategy, good UX, good accessibility. All of these things can be optimized in isolation and will benefit SEO.<p>If by javascript rendering they meant one of those fancy endless scrolls, then it is likely they did not implement this correctly.

The school I graduated from, BYU, has a strong business program and a culture of entrepreneurship. A number of my friends and acquaintances contacted me with ideas for tech-empowered businesses they wanted to form, but I had the sense to stay away from anything that sounded like &quot;I had this great idea for a business last week, why don&#x27;t you build it for me and we&#x27;ll see what happens.&quot;<p>When my now-cofounder Sam approached me, it was a very different experience. It was obvious that he had put months of work into developing his idea on his own time, with mockups and tons of user testing of various ideas, and literally had gone as far as he could without actually building the product. Even after we decided to start working together, we spent several months contracting together for a 3rd party, before we finally decided to strike out on our own. When we eventually did form a startup, we split the equity 50-50 and we&#x27;ve both been working 110% since day 1.<p>In retrospect, I didn&#x27;t end up joining with Sam because the idea was much better than the other ones I&#x27;d heard about, or because he had access to connections or capital that I couldn&#x27;t easily find myself. It was because he demonstrated clearly that he didn&#x27;t consider the idea alone to be 80% of the value, respected what I brought to the table, and worked hard enough to bring his half to the table too.<p>I guess my best advice to the non-technical looking for a cofounder (beyond learning as much as you can about the tech side of the business on your own) would be to try to find ways to demonstrate, through your actions, that you have what it takes to push a new company forward. The actions Sam took on his own, and when we first started working together, demonstrated that to my satisfaction, which is why I was more than happy to sign on as a cofounder.",1422459915

Every country has different laws that affect the legal status of an exit node operator.<p>For example, an Austrian man was arrested in 2011 for running an exit node and charged with being an accomplice to crimes that were carried out over Tor using his exit node. He was ultimately found not guilty, but a law was passed as a result that effectively makes it illegal to run a Tor exit in Austria. [0]<p>Meanwhile, in the US no one has ever been arrested simply for running a Tor exit node (at least to my knowledge). Anecdotal information suggests that the most difficult thing is finding someone to host the node (many cloud VPS providers, for example, will not) if you don&#x27;t host it yourself. A Reddit commentator and operator of Tor exits suggests that running Tor exits is <i>protected</i> under U.S. law, although I&#x27;m not sure if this has been tested in court [1].<p>I think Mozilla should take the (relatively small, due to their presence in the U.S.) risk of running Tor exit nodes.

And unless your hobby crosses a line and reflects poorly on your profession, no-one cares about your hobby.<p>However, if you&#x27;re a comedian stealing jokes (online or off), the charge remains a very serious and career-damaging charge.  True, no-one particularly cared about a random twitter parody account stealing jokes but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s <i>also</i> not a professional comedian&#x27;s work. (Or at least not identifiable as such.)  If that account were unmasked as the work of a professional comedian, we&#x27;d see a much different reaction.<p>As to the content mills and people reposting content without attribution -- that&#x27;s its own problem, larger than jokes.",1422459686

However, I rather doubt the Go runtime bootstraps any faster than libc, so it probably wouldn&#x27;t help here. One consequence is that Linux and libc are tightly coupled and some of the &quot;syscall&quot; behavior you depend on is actually implemented as a wrapper in libc. This has caused some behavioral differences between Go and C that have surprised the language developers.",1422459114

Non-technical people (myself included) often have a bit of a complex about being non-technical. They are well-steeped in the YC/Stanford/Valley zeitgeist and believe their project won&#x27;t be taken seriously if it doesn&#x27;t have legitimate engineering talent on the founding team. Depending on the product and the team&#x27;s growth strategy, this may or may not actually be true.<p>2. I would posit that fear of not finding a technical cofounder (FONFATC, I just coined an acronym) is really three related, but distinct fears:\n  a. Fear of not being able to get the MVP / beta / 1.0 versions built.\n  b. Fear of not being able to raise money to grow because VC&#x27;s won&#x27;t take your team seriously if you don&#x27;t have a technical cofounder.\n  c. Fear of not being able to recruit good engineers as you scale from, say, 3 people to 15 people. (The reasoning being, good engineers are going to have doubts about working for an organization that doesn&#x27;t have a technical cofounder; both in terms of not wanting to be supervised by people who don&#x27;t understand the technical fundamentals and in terms of working in a non-engineer-centric culture).<p>3. Non-technical people in some cases spend more time trying to find/recruit a technical cofounder than they would have to spend to learn the necessary technical skills to build a basic MVP. Not 1.0, ready-to-ship-to-paying-customers product, but MVP. Getting technical people to join your project is a less painful proposition once you have a product, even a crappy one.<p>4. Technical friends might not be willing to join your project as a cofounder, for reasons including: you can&#x27;t pay them the salary they want/need; they&#x27;re working on their own thing; they don&#x27;t want to quit their sweet job; they think your idea is dumb. Even in these cases, you can get a lot of help from them if they are in fact your friends. They may not be interested in getting on your cap table, but they&#x27;ll probably do a monthly code review with you if you ask nicely.",1422458875

Far from it.  I&#x27;ve met some interesting folks at events over the years (cofounder dating, meetups, startup weekends, etc).

It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad attitude to have, but usually the skills aren&#x27;t enough to execute enough to get traction.<p>I&#x27;m sometimes surprised at how far people get with so little, and those are the people I tend to want to work with or help out in some way - regardless of the industry/work/project.  I like working with people who can get stuff done.  It&#x27;s just harder to do that at many networking events, because the people who are &#x27;getting stuff done&#x27; usually don&#x27;t have time for those events because they&#x27;re getting stuff done.<p>Couldn&#x27;t tell if you meant &quot;horrible attitude&quot; at me directly because of the comment or what.??",1422457866

That is, I want end-to-end encryption for my client-server application.<p>The client encrypts the user&#x27;s data with a cryptographic key derived from the user&#x27;s password, so it&#x27;s important that the server not be able to figure out the password because that would allow the server to decrypt the user&#x27;s data.\n The client therefore uses Secure Remote Password protocol to avoid sending the password to the server.  So far so good.<p>Now here&#x27;s where my design gets a little unorthodox.  The problem is that users in general are very bad at creating passwords - usually picking a password from the top 10,000 passwords list - which would make it pretty easy for an attacker who has access to the server to decrypt the user&#x27;s data.  Therefore I plan to generate a random set of characters and append them to the User ID field, so the user would need to log in with something like these credentials:<p><pre><code>  User ID: John-CPE4E38J\n  Password: snoopy\n</code></pre>\nBut before processing these credentials the login code moves the random characters to the password so the underlying SRP authentication library sees this:<p><pre><code>  User ID: John\n  Password: snoopy-CPE4E38J\n</code></pre>\nIn addition, the client offers to remember the User ID (ie. John-CPE4E38J) so that most of the time the user only has to remember their password.<p>What do you think of this approach?  Am I breaking the do-not-implement-your-own-security-algorithm rule?  Or is this a good way to strengthen the security of my application?<p>[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol",1422457719

1220043,comment,1218653,1219018,0,0,ximeng,,,"At first I thought you were right, but reading the article more closely I think it's OK. It's talking about the relationship between the ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode. There's more information available about that in the Unicode standard here:<p><a href=""http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.0.0/appC.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.0.0/appC.pdf</a><p>See section C.3 for the differences between the UTF-8 encodings. The key paragraph is:<p>""The definition of UTF-8 in Annex D of ISO/IEC 10646:2003 also allows for the use of five- and six-byte sequences to encode characters that are outside the range of the Unicode character set; those five- and six-byte sequences are illegal for the use of UTF-8 as an encoding form of Unicode characters. ISO/IEC 10646 does not allow mapping of surrogate code positions, known as RC-elements in that standard; that restriction is identical to the restriction for the Unicode definition of UTF-8.""<p>That's where the extra characters come from, as the UTF-8 encoding used by twitter is apparently not checking to see if the characters are valid Unicode characters, as required by Unicode UTF-8. This is the extra restriction referred to in the passage above that is imposed by the Unicode version of UTF-8 but not the ISO version. As quoted in the article, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Description"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Description</a> says that the ISO version of UTF-8 can encode 31 bits. I couldn't find a source for the encoding of ISO UTF-8.<p>The other part I wasn't sure about at first was where the 1,112,064 possible characters figure came from. It turns out that's the 17 Unicode planes of 65,536 characters each, less the range from 0xD000 to 0xDFFF reserved for surrogate pairs.<p>In other words:<p>1+0x10ffff-(0xdfff-0xd800+1) = 1 112 064",1269568093

The MPEG LA has been shaking a stick over Theora's head, but has yet to point out which specific patent(s) Theora is indeed infringing.<p>In fact, noone has come forward with a specific patent that has been shown to infringe after scrutiny and noone has yet sued Firefox for shipping this so-called infringing codec.<p>The tone of the article is basically a ""put up or shut up"" directed at the MPEG LA members.

With a game studio, you then have to make the next game, and past success isn't nearly a guarantee of future performance. You can do sequels, but even this isn't bullet proof.<p>As other commenters pointed out, there are exceptions within the marketplace.

There clearly are codec patents that MPEG LA doesn't own. There clearly are codec patents that they do own. MPEG LA clearly isn't going to sue, in the immediacy, over their own patents.<p>Meanwhile, it is indeed entirely in MPEG LA's own hands whether or not they will sue over use of Theora.

I'm sjl on BitBucket/GitHub, or you can email me at steve@stevelosh.com<p>I'm also looking for advice on how to translate the screencast-format tips like this: <a href=""http://ja.hgtip.com/tips/advanced/2010-02-11-merging-mq-patches-with-rebase/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ja.hgtip.com/tips/advanced/2010-02-11-merging-mq-patc...</a><p>One idea I had was to create a display:none-by-default ""transcription"" div element below the embedded video which would contain the transcription of the screencast.  There could be a ""view transcription"" link that would show that div. This would make it searchable and translators could translate that content into their languages.<p>This doesn't really solve the problem of translating the actual <i>voice</i> in the screencast though.  Screenr (the site I used to make the screencast) doesn't support subtitles, but YouTube does.  Is it possible to ""fork"" videos on YouTube and add different subtitles?  I haven't found a way, but maybe I'm just not looking in the right place.<p>I'd really like to make the ""screencast"" format of tips work.  Personally I'm very much a visual learner, so seeing a quick screencast of something helps me a lot.  However, if it's going to be impossible to create a decent translation without a lot of work I'll abandon the idea (for now).",1269567145

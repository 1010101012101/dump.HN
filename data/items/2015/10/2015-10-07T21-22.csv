The fact that the second store serving the disenfranchised is substandard or non-competitive has nothing to do with the fact that the original store would not serve some population.  A third store could also service those disenfranchised by the first and unsatisfied by the second.  That&#x27;s capitalism.  Now if there&#x27;s some kind of regulation limiting the number of stores, that&#x27;s anti-capitalistic government action (a government-sanctioned oligopoly of sorts).<p>Let&#x27;s say the baker decides to close their business rather than be forced to serve some group of people.  Is that baker still obligated to make that cake?  Why?  What if the baker moves their business to a region that allows personal biases, is the baker obligated to bake that cake?<p>Your example is more akin to stores requiring patrons to wear shirt and shoes to receive service. Potential customers are being discriminated against here for an arbitrary reason based on some ideal of what is considered public decency.  Do you think that a Muslim store requiring female customers to wear a burqa is discriminatory, or are they practicing freedom of religion?  Does the government forcing the Muslim store to allow female customers without a burqa violate the first amendment?",1444255189

10349420,comment,10347461,10349350,0,0,thrownaway123,,,"Agreed that the article fails to empathize with different preferences - I would also argue that it really only considered one side of the environmental argument. Density leads to efficiency in many cases, but the culture of high consumption, travel, and general activity that is promoted by density can result in more pollution rather than less.<p>In the ideal if we could hold human behavior constant, high density would still be more efficient per capita. Also certainly there are suburbanites who consume and travel with the best of them - but to an individual who is self-aware of their carbon footprint, living in a less dense area may even be an improvement (for instance if it makes the idea of a walking or bicycling commute less unpleasant). And certainly our planet cannot support billions of people driving and buying new plastic toys every year in perpetuity, regardless of where or how densely they live.<p>Ultimately, if we want to fix the environmental/ecological issues our species faces, it will take more than building some new residences in major cities. This isn&#x27;t to say it shouldn&#x27;t be done - but the article definitely seems to overstate the impact of it.",1444255166

Personally I can be locked into my screen and in a state of flow for hours at a time, provided the task challenges and engages me. Is this healthy? Time will tell, but my eyesight has remained constant for the last 5 years. That said, I can lucky enough to have views, so I stare into the distance frequently.

How frequently are you getting outside? How frequently are you talking to other people?

Some of the posts even pointed people at the right subreddit, with the knowledge and complicity of the FPH moderators. We know this because at least one person who was on the receiving end of this complained to the mods, and they responded by posting another post drawing more attention to the original one and posting her photo in the subreddit sidebar.

You both seem to assume that I believe immigration to be a 100% clear and unambiguous benefit, which isn&#x27;t the case.<p>I&#x27;ll go further; anyone who presents immigration arguments as simple is selling something.<p>In reality I&#x27;m making counter-points to someone I feel is trying to punch more than the evidence seems to allow.<p>Now to the points you&#x27;ve raised...<p>> The same claim - that immigrants are a benefit to the economy - has been stated without refute for 20 years now in the US<p>This thread is about the UK, and I learned all I know about the US from watching the movie Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps... but sure... if you like let&#x27;s talk about the US. Why do you think nobody, apparently <i>ever</i>, refutes the benefits of US immigration?<p>> The participant rate of employment in the US...<p>Yep. Clearly a first-order effect of high immigration (legal or otherwise) is going to be competition for some types of jobs. I haven&#x27;t heard any argument with that. There will be second-order and third-order effects on employment though.<p>It&#x27;s also important to try to quantify the approximate size of each effect and the timescale over which it occurs. You&#x27;re welcome to translate that &quot;participant rate of employment&quot; reference for an international audience. They didn&#x27;t cover that in Nutty Professor 2.<p>> Now the taxpayers get to subsidize both the unemployed American worker and the immigrant (via health care, schooling, lost taxes, etc.)<p>I&#x27;m surprised that illegal immigrants have much access to healthcare & education access in the US. I&#x27;d be curious to know exactly what the cost of that is.<p>The third type of subsidy you raise there &#x27;lost taxes&#x27; could really just be a short-hand for &#x27;all government services&#x27;, so isn&#x27;t additive with the others. What&#x27;s in the &quot;etc.&quot;?<p>Don&#x27;t misunderstand, having one group subsidising another is certainly a social justice issue, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s in the top 5 biggest social justice issues in America. The Klumps were very informative on that point.<p>> How this is a benefit for anyone other than capital owners is something I&#x27;d love to hear.<p>From your references to H1B visas <i>and</i> to subsidising immigrants not paying taxes I assume you&#x27;re objecting to both legal <i>and</i> illegal immigrants. Legal immigrants are much much easier to defend:<p>60% of the top US companies were <i>founded</i> by 1st or 2nd gen immigrants (Google, Apple, eBay, Tesla), and 15% of US presidents are 2nd gen.<p>Immigrants are also <i>twice</i> as likely as naturals to start a business, creating both jobs <i>and</i> market efficiency. Both of those things generate tax revenue and prolong the US position as the #1 economy in the world.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t believe in trickle-down economics you&#x27;d sound like a crackpot to argue against that.<p>With <i>illegal</i> immigrants there&#x27;s much less data and the arguments I&#x27;ve heard are are much less convncing... but I still don&#x27;t believe <i>anyone</i> who presents it as a simple argument.",1444254804

The Dhaka vs DC graph was kind of funny, because the quality of life in Dhaka is probably much lower in large part due to that density.  But more to the point, I agree that no one has a right to the density they&#x27;ve become accustomed to, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that an increase in density won&#x27;t amount to a drop in the quality of life to them.  Take for instance the comment where someone sad something to the effect that without going all Hong Kong, SF could increase density by 30 or 40% by utilizing unused/undeveloped parcels, and adding a few floors to existing buildings.  Thats probably true, but that has no effect on the public spaces.  So you now have 30-40% more people on the sidewalks.  30-40% more cars on the road.  30-40% higher density.  For some people that is a positive thing, but for those that think it is a negative thing, no amount of hand waving is change that.<p>By hand waving, I mean assertion without argument.  You may convince them that more and better restaurants will open, and that may genuinely change their mind, but many people I&#x27;ve talked to that prefer the high density lifestyle have a hard time grasping that there are those of us that genuinely do not.  I live in a city of 120k in one of the least densely populated states in the US.  It was 50k when I first came here.  It has been genuinely intolerable for me, and I spend all my free time getting away to significantly less dense areas, and I am actively looking for jobs in areas lower than 50k (hard to do in technical fields).  Of course I&#x27;m an extreme example, but the point being that trying to portray the quality of life concerns of people that prefer lower density as irrelevant is not an honest comeback.  Disregard those concerns as being counter to the larger good, but don&#x27;t pretend that people that hold those concerns will be happy about all the things they will gain at higher densities.",1444254392

Because the internet is not reality, the type of behavior you see on reddit and 4chan may reflect our nature, but it is enabled by anonymity and the complete lack of repercussions.  If people behaved the way they do on these boards they would quickly be ostracized by society if not having the shit beaten out of them on a regular basis.<p>Applying some sort of freedom ideology to internet communities like reddit is not very useful in practice.  We have to look at the shape of the internet and recognize that freedom on the internet is not the problem—after all cyberspace is unlimited, you can have infinite communities, and geography is irrelevant.  All groups can find a place on the internet, and they will always be able to.  We simply don&#x27;t need to worry about that, and it&#x27;s silly to wring our hands over the decision to moderate this or that community.<p>What we do need to worry about is the ability for formerly marginalized sociopaths to hurt other people from the safety of their basement dwelling.  Whether it&#x27;s unending bombardment of harassment or actual physical harm like swatting, we need to get a handle on this.

But of course the downside to that is that the resulting research...has no immediate practical application.<p>None of this should be taken as criticism exactly since both strategies have their advantages (and it&#x27;s not my money anyway), it&#x27;s just not quite clear from the post what sort of research is going to be funded.",1444252410

That is not a niche case at all. Think of a square-root function that returns a Maybe Double. At most call sites you can optimize away all matchings, but you can&#x27;t do it statically.

The problem of program optimization is closely related to the problem of program verification (to optimize something you need proof of its runtime behavior), and both face undecidable problems that simply cannot be handled statically. A JIT could eliminate any kind of branching at any particular site -- be it function dispatch, pattern matching or a simple if statement -- and eliminating branches opens the door to a whole slew of optimizations. Doing branch elimination statically is simply <i>undecidable</i> in many, many cases, regardless of the language you&#x27;re using. If you could deduce the pertinent information for most forms of (at least theoretical) optimization, you&#x27;ve just solved the halting problem.<p>Whether or not what you say is true in practice depends on lots of factors (like how far languages can take this and still be cheaply-usable, how sophisticated JITs can be), and my bet is that it would end up simply being a bunch of tradeoffs, which is exactly where we started.",1444252306

But Reddit also wants a PC site, which sells ads. Newspapers want to whip a popular whipping boy because it sells ads.

Let&#x27;s admit that this is about <i>silencing</i> racists and sexists.<p>I don&#x27;t have any skin in this game (the subreddits I subscribe to could easily be replaced by going back to the bulletin boards I used in the early 2000s) so I really don&#x27;t care if Reddit crashes and burns, or if they have free speech: it&#x27;s just not a platform that I care about.

These people wouldn&#x27;t politely debate anything, because they&#x27;d get more upvotes and positive responses for attacking the other side than trying to be reasonable.<p>FWIW, I dislike Moffat, because I think Doctor Who works better in a more episodic format - long arcs don&#x27;t work when the Tardis is in the mix.

I am sure you have experience of your own and that your beliefs have worked well for you, but I do not feel any obligation to adopt them based on your say-so. Nor do I expect you to adopt mine, but I will lay them out for your consideration.<p>Of course conflicts can escalate once you are already fighting. A bully&#x27;s objective may be simply to scare someone, knock them down and administer a few painful blows. Or a mugger&#x27;s objective might simply be to get whatever cash is in a person&#x27;s wallet. Knocking such a erson down a few times or slapping them around may be sufficient to get them to take off. One can escalate a conflict by actively trying to hurt someone rather than merely repel them or drive them away, in which case the opponent will be inclined to try to knock the escalator unconscious or inflict a serious, debilitating injury such as breaking someone&#x27;s arm. There&#x27;s another level of escalation again in which one person actively attempts to kill the other and makes their intention absolutely clear, such that the other person fully believes their life to be in jeopardy and either begs for mercy or fights to remain alive.<p>You are suggesting that there is no distinction between the different states. This is nonsense. At the international level we are well aware of the differences between skirmishes, limited engagements, limited war, and total war. Conflicts between individuals are similarly nuanced, and the notion of a proportionate response is well established in law; if someone tries to steal your cellphone, say, and slaps you in an attempt to startle/intimidate you into letting go of it, you do not automatically have the right to kill them and you&#x27;ll need to make a convincing case about being in fear for your life rather than just angry about the prospect of losing your phone.<p>There are certainly situations in which is it appropriate to inflict as much harm as possible. I have been there and done that. But I believe those situations are exceptional and I make no apology for holding back in situations where extreme measures are not warranted. Of course I would not like to be wrong and find myself a victim, but nor would I wish to be wrong and find myself having gone too far.",1444251749

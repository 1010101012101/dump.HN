The crawler, ripper, indexer, DB and the website have been tweaked almost daily over the last 6 months or so.  The interface is under a re-design and so is most of the back-end (crawling needs to be done better, uploading to S3).  It all runs on 2 linux machines and ripped data is stored on Amazon's S3 service.  So-far the only money that we put into it ourselves is $20 for a logo off ebay that we're not even using and the S3 charges, which are about $20/mo at this point.  Other hardware and bandwidth is just our own personal machines and internet connections, so that's 'free'.  :)  We don't have any investors.

Now he's deciding whether or not to continue on or stop and go to grad school. We're so close to launching and then would need a few 3-6 months to see if it has any potential in the market. We all know Paul Graham's opinion on going to grad school verses seeing your startup through to completion. I thought some friendly encouragement from the y-combinator crowd might help illuminate his decision. Ironically, our ""start-up"" is a decision making tool, and he has posted a decision page listing all the pros and cons. It's a wiki so anyone can add their two cents. It's still in pre alpha stage but here's a direct link if anyone wants to help steer this sorry fellow from a sad life of grad school at 'cough cough' Indiana State University, verses doing what he always deep in his heart wanted to do.

233569,comment,233166,233305,0,0,webwright,,,"You were denied funding?  ""The VC group""?  How many times were you told no by how many investors?  The way you said it makes it look like you talked to 1 firm and then stopped.  Fundraising is a process-- not a single ask.  Expect to have 1 person pitching, largely full-time, for 3-9 months to tons of different investors.  But to be honest-- a VC firm isn't going to touch a company with no traction except in the rare event that the founders have an unusual amount of credibility.  You'd really be better off with angels.  Though (on the surface), I don't think you'll get buyoff from ANY investors unless you can prove there's a business there.  In your shoes I wouldn't talk to investors until I had a proven growth rate and 10-20k uniques per day.<p>I'm going to disagree with the people saying, ""oooh, market validation"".  This validates that Google wants to index more stuff and Flash builders want to get indexed.  It doesn't validate that users would go to a vertical flash search engine.<p>When Google does something in the search game, they are generally going to win.  Without the exit strategy of selling to them, you are left with building your own search brand (supported by ads).  Are there enough people who are passionate about finding Flash stuff that they'd rather use your (better) flash search engine over an integrated experience at Google?",1214948301

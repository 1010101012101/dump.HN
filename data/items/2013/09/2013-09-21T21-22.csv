6424756,comment,6422793,6423871,18,0,lostlogin,,,"Exactly. My drivers license expired (the fact that could happen was news to me - law change came in after I got it) and I discovered this when trying to rent a small truck to move house. I went to renew it. They wanted 3 months of utility statement for the property I listed as my address. That&#x27;s all well and good, but I didn&#x27;t live there yet. I drove without a license for 3 months to meet their requirement. Then to cap it all off, at the appointment to get the license they wanted 2 forms of ID. As my old license had expired it wasn&#x27;t valid, so I used my 2 passports. They seemed to think having 2 was illegal and called the police. Well done New Zealand Land Transport Authority. It was a pleasure.",1379800777

Thank you for the clarification.<p>My updated point is that when I lived in the US I also had limits in what I could take from a bank machine. If I wanted to get more than that, I had to go to the bank itself.<p>You write: &quot;If you want to withdraw more of your own money, you have to ask permission and give a reasonable explanation why one is taking out &quot;that much cash&quot;. Only if the bank approves of your reasons to withdraw money will you be able to do so.&quot;, but what you&#x27;ve been pointing to have been bank machine limits, not cash withdraws.<p>It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t believe you. I know that Swedbank wants to get rid of dealing with cash. But do you have a reference for having to justify to the bank your need to withdraw the money?<p>As an extreme, and admittedly not likely case, what happens if they say &quot;no&quot; and you respond &quot;I wish to close my accounts. Please give it to me in cash.&quot;?<p>(BTW, I live directly over a Swedbank, which makes it very easy to get to their own bank machine. :) )",1379800761

Some if those are by the sea, which would continuously boil, filling the atmosphere with steam and cause a new greenhouse effect boost and a wave of heating that would push temperatures even higher.<p>The problem is there are certain thresholds that cause new greenhouse effects to kick in and push temperatures even higher. For example, if temperatures rise enough to melt the Methane frost layers, they&#x27;ll melt and probably kick global temperatures up another 5 or 6 degrees all by themselves. If we trigger enough of these knock on effects in a chain, well end up with an unlivable atmosphere. That&#x27;s the extreme scenario, but it is not impossible.",1379800735

Yes, but it would require even more setup (since it involves generating several datasets that are copied to four machines), making sure configuration files are up to date (less an issue now than when we first started), and could involve restarting named (since one of the datasets is a particular zone file), and then starting up the various programs across all four systems.<p>And then, the testing environment changes.

There are many programs out there now (Outlaw, Competitors WOD, CF Football etc) that fill the gap and actually give decent programming, but the programming from crossfit.com is really, really bad.<p>Did you know that ALL the athletes that competed at the Crossfit games do not use crossfit.com WODs as the base of their programming? It&#x27;s true. Go and check it out. What does this tell you? That crossfit, the programming, is all bullshit. The elite athletes use strength training as the basis of their programming and complement that with met cons as they get closer to the games.<p>There is also a culture that promotes things like rips (ripping your hands, say during a deadlift), or rope burns or other types of stupid things as badges of honor. You can&#x27;t go a few days on /r/crossfit without seeing someone mention their ripped hands with pride. This is dumb and promotes the wrong things.<p>And beyond that, frankly, high-rep olympic lifts, high-rep box jumps (DON&#x27;T JUMP DOWN!

We have to write code, we have to manage students, teach, publish, apply for grants, manage research groups or entire projects, handle scientific and financial reporting, etc. The problem is that our skills don&#x27;t exactly match company requirements that normally have different people for most of these tasks. To make things worse, people tend to believe that we will be arrogant pricks who will demand really high salaries even though we are clueless about how things work outside academia. Just look at some of the comments here.<p>For an entry level programming position a recent CS BSc appears much more desirable and cheaper than any PhD.

Of course.  But not exercising carries its own set of risks.<p>As for me, I&#x27;ll stick with exercise.  And for that, CrossFit makes more sense than anything else I&#x27;ve ever seen.",1379798998

Serious audio problems do still exist on Linux systems, and it is a source of huge annoyance for me that my system still causes my (very expensive) studio monitors to pop when switching between some sound sources in some situations. But, these are mostly to do with the sound server and switching sources rather than with glitches in actual audio.<p>I still can&#x27;t use Linux as my primary OS for audiovisual work because there are still issues with getting many channels of low latency, high resolution, audio playing and recording reliably.<p>But, the issues you describe as they apply to this task are mostly a long solved problem, at least for very simple tasks, like reliably playing 16 bit, 44.1 kHz, stereo audio. Honestly, there&#x27;s never been a time that I can remember when I couldn&#x27;t reliably play a stereo 16 bit, 44.1k, file back on a Linux system...going back to 1995, or so, when I first started using Linux. The problems come when you demand a little more of the system.<p>Once again, errors of the level that exist today (which are completely inaudible to even trained ears in most cases), in terms of latency, jitter, dropouts, etc. are so tiny and insignificant that they would be impossible for the current hardware to replicate. The hardware is so much slower than the input signal that noise from the audio signal will be lost in the much larger noise of the hardware. You can <i>see</i> the hardware noise in the printed objects. It&#x27;s vastly larger than anything the computer output is going to screw up, and it&#x27;ll be many generations before that stops being true (and, by then, maybe Linux will finally have its act together on audio).<p>Windows, BTW, finally does have its act together on audio, and has for five+ years. I can reliably play a couple dozen 96k 24 bit tracks while recording more on slightly high end laptop. Obviously Mac is also solid on this front.",1379798960

6424592,comment,6424280,6424280,73,0,Whitespace,,,"TL;DR: I got rhabdo from crossfit last year.  My CPK was 100,000 and I spent 5 days in the hospital.  I wasn&#x27;t overweight but I wasn&#x27;t fit when I got it, and I got it during the first day of a beginner course.<p>Ask me anything.<p>==============================<p>I did crossfit for a couple of months in 2010 and loved it, but I had to stop since I moved to a new apartment and the gym times wouldn&#x27;t work with the longer commute.  I always wanted to go back, so in June 2012 I started up again, taking the two-week beginner course (I wasn&#x27;t in the best shape and I wanted to ease into it).<p>During the first day back, we went through a lot of basic movements and listened to the instructor talk about what crossfit was like.  In the hour-long class, we spent the last ten minutes talking about rhabdomyolysis; what it is, the symptoms, the danger, common ways to get it, etc.<p>The workout of the day was tabata squats (20 seconds of as many BW reps, then 10 seconds of rest, repeat 8 times for a total of 4 minutes and 2:40 of exercising), tabata pushups, and tabata situps.<p>The squats were the one that got me.<p>The next morning, I couldn&#x27;t walk, but that was expected since it was my first day back.  I pushed myself quite hard (knowing what crossfit was like), but I wasn&#x27;t competing with the people in my class, I was competing with myself.  I took it easy and rested.<p>The day after that, I couldn&#x27;t really bend my legs because of the extreme soreness, and walking down the stairs was neigh impossible.  It took a while, but I took the subway to the office where there&#x27;s a gym with a stationary bike, as slow biking was the only thing that would ease the soreness in my quads.<p>After 6 hours at work, periodically biking and reading online, I noticed my urine was coca-cola colored, and that it was the telltale sign of rhabdo.  I knew that because the crossfit instructor drilled it into my head two days earlier.<p>I looked online for a hospital that my insurance covered, took a cab, checked myself in saying I had rhabdo, and I began a 5-day stay where I received lots of saline solution (1000ml 6x a day, IIRC) to help flush the myoglobin out of my body.  Luckily for me, the hospital saw a lot of cases of rhabdo from not crossfit members, but prisoners.  They have little else to do than workout extremely hard, and the hospital saw dozens of prisoners a year.<p>My creatine kinase was almost 100,000 (excess myoglobin is the problem, but high creatine kinase is a proxy for high myoglobin, and CPK levels are commonly checked).  TFA is right in that the normal is < 100.  IIRC, the doctors estimated I dissolved 5 lbs of muscle tissue into my bloodstream to get a CPK that high.  I was bored in the hospital so I charted my CPK to determine when they&#x27;d release me: <a href=""http://imgur.com/18HYKNr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/18HYKNr</a><p>==============================<p>Many tests afterwards showed my kidneys are fine, and I haven&#x27;t noticed (or read about) what the TFA describes as &quot;flabbiness&quot; or some sort of water retention in my legs.  I also haven&#x27;t noticed that my legs are weak; on the contrary, after lots of biking over bridges my legs are stronger than my squat days (at least when it comes to endurance, not power).<p>TFA is being a bit sensationalist and anecdotal about rhabdo being crossfit&#x27;s &quot;dirty little secret.&quot;  To add another anecdote into the fire, everyone I know that does crossfit knows what rhabdo is, and rhabdo is mentioned in beginner classes multiple times; not only what it is, but the symptoms, what to do when you get it, and how, if left untreated, myoglobinuria can lead to acute renal failure and death.<p>I haven&#x27;t been to crossfit in over a year, but TBH I&#x27;m itching to go back.  I&#x27;m the kind of personality that will really push myself hard – probably harder than most – but now I know a little better and will hold back a tiny bit, especially when doing high reps of low weight.<p>==============================<p>Update: My first crossfit experience was at Crossfit Virtuosity in Brooklyn, NY and I got rhabdo at The Black Box in NYC.<p>Also, my memory isn&#x27;t so great as I thought.  I took the class on a Friday and, that same night, moved into a new apartment.  The combination of crossfit and carrying lots of boxes/furniture on the same day was probably the cause.",1379798259

It&#x27;s the &quot;proof&quot; that critics of CrossFit use to try and show that the entire sport is dangerous and that we don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re doing.\nThere are definitely examples in the video of athletes losing their midline, and going heavier than they safely should, but the point that is completely overlooked is that these athletes are trying classic strongman lifts for probably the very first time. The lift they&#x27;re practicing is called the continental clean and, believe it or not, they&#x27;re doing it more right than wrong. It&#x27;s an awkward lift that&#x27;s used for cleaning axle bars that are too fat to grip and clean conventionally. Anyone trying that for the first time will look similarly awkward. It&#x27;s part of learning something new. Whoever originally shot and posted this video never meant for it to be taken as a typical crossfit class full of elite athletes.

The author implies that there will be a mass migration of users to another service if Facebook remains stagnant in terms of carrying out acquisitions. But Facebook continues to improve and update the user experience, so there is little incentive for users to move to a would-be competitor. Not when they already have connections with family members, close friends, and many others. Facebook has very much become a part of many users daily lives like using the Internet, and users have already invested a lot into Facebook; it&#x27;s like a sunk cost. FB may remain static (in the same niche market) if they don&#x27;t carry out more acquisitions, but that&#x27;s (may be) fine.

Never use a value in the domain of your input as a null value.

By the time this happens, the glitch is over.<p>Also, consider that not all audio glitches are of the type that cause zeroes to be emitted.

It then plays the audio file out to the printer through the headphone jack in your computer. This waveform drives a pair of electro magnetic mirrors. The higher the volume, the higher the voltage, the more the mirrors move. The purpose of these mirrors is to reflect and control the path of the laser beam. By using the audio waveform generated from the 3D model data to drive the mirrors, we are able to get the laser beam to draw out the shape of the object.

In addition to all of this, Google does not seem afraid to venture out into completely new areas.

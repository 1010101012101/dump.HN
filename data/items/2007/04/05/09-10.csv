The 'lynx' and 'spell' utilities inherent in most Linux distributions would suffice for the basics.<p>I think the service would be better marketed as a last line of defense against linguistic embarrasment. If the 'service' found a typo, punctuation (that would be a little harder) or grammar error on a given URL it could simply e-mail a designated contact, show the error in context and suggestions to correct it.<p>This would be useful only in situations where ajax based ""as you type"" correction (or more traditional regex post-posting) is not possible, or if a site blindly imported harvested content from other sources without human checking for such errors.<p>Given the ease of which this could be developed, I say .. go for it.",1175767189

By coming here, I've amplified my purchasing power ^2 and live more comfortably paying less. The birth of my daughter with complications and a c-section was just under $5000.00 USD, in a state of the art facility that rivals Hopkins itself (Google, ""The Medical City Pasig City"" to see it). A pediatric appointment costs me $10, medicine even less. I know my move was a little drastic, but it opened many doors. :)",1175766290

It was not just an essay, for me this was a trip down memory lane.  Thanks to the author for a very insightful and enjoyable piece of literature, I hope to see this selected as its been submitted to Slashdot.\n",1175765828
9138,comment,8780,9103,0,0,JMiao,,,"I couldn't agree more.  Merely providing a new interaction and distribution framework isn't enough to revolutionize television.  I'm not convinced on 100% user-submitted content, but Joost's current reliance on the big TV networks and production bigwigs for content is -- and has proven to be -- problematic.<p>I still give Joost a lot of credit for their work, but their solution, like TiVo, YouTube, and, to a certain extent, Netflix is only an evolutionary step in the bigger picture.<p>For now.",1175765344

He also happened to be a lawyer, so legal counsel was very accessible, if not free. This is somewhere in Paul's essays. Google around and you'll find more.",1175764988

Seriously, it would just be an amazingly fun and educational experience to associate with like-minded hackers at the top of their game.",1175764635

126283,comment,126152,126152,0,0,mdemare,,,"What a terrible article. We ""hunch over keyboards, pecking out individual lines of code in esoteric programming languages""? What a cliche! Also, some of us use Ruby or Python.<p>And we don't talk to users? When there's so much research on interaction design, testing, measuring how users behave? Not that you should always listen to users either (a point completely lost on the author) (<a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001063.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001063.html</a>).<p>And intentional programming may sound revolutionary, but our solution to that problem are domain specific languages, and those aren't very new either. And if non-programmers can use those DSLs (SQL, Excel) that doesn't make them programmers.<p>Also, it's naive to assume that users could create programs except for the scary part where you communicate with the computer.<p>To program is to think, structured. It means considering <i>all</i> the consequences. x% of programming is error handling (citation needed). Non-programmers cannot think logically enough. The thinking part is what makes programming hard - the arcane API stuff is merely the annoying part - the accidental complexity. And we <i>are</i> getting rid of it, slowly but steadily.",1204315017

126274,comment,126158,126224,0,0,darose,,,"+1.<p>I think you need to go back to work, lick your wounds and start again.  You can't start a startup on no money.  Firstly because you need to be able to support yourself until both a) you've created version 1 or your product/service, and b) you've started to get some users.  (No investor will take you seriously until then.)  And secondly, because the stress and distraction of your finances will interfere with your ability to succeed.<p>Go back to work.  Work on it on the side - eves and weekends.  Save up some money - then leave the job and try again.<p>Sucks?  I know it does.  (And yes, I know it's hard to make a lot of progress in your spare time.)  I'm going through this exact thing right now.  (And I live in expensive NYC too!)  But that's the way it's gotta be.  You don't have a windfall in the bank from a previous startup - or a rich daddy.  Neither do I.  And unfortunately for people like us, trying to launch a startup means a race against time to build something before the money runs out.  Well, you've lost this heat of the race.  (As did I.)  That doesn't mean the race is over.  Keep the dream alive on the side, and in a year take it full-time again.<p>Hang in there - and good luck!",1204314606

There are some brilliant people using Java to drive enormous business at big companies, a lot of middling, competent people, and some dreck.  Although I would guess that Java's bell curve is heavy to the left, because people that don't do computers out interest choose Java for the money, while a portion of the smartest developers self-select into more powerful but less commercially viable languages (Python, Ruby, Lisp, Smalltalk, Erlang, etc).",1204314590

That was the first thing I was looking for, myself.  It did not even support the syntax Capistrano promotes by using an underscore, such as my_dir.ls_la, and that's a shame.<p>Of course, we could use #system to invoke a Bourne shell to run any command, but that's too much overhead for heavy use, so that option does not matter.<p>One of the most important things a shell does is piping.  Rush does allow one to get away from needing to pipe through commands like grep, wc, awk, and sed, but you cannot get away from the fact that there are cases where you just have to pipe data between commands that have a complex relationship with that data that you would not want to recreate within Rush.  For Rush to have a chance of being considered seriously, it also needs to address pipes and make them easy to invoke.",1204313464

Take what I say with that in mind.</disclaimer><p>I've mulled over this question a lot.  After reading all kinds of articles and books about founding a business, it seems to me that the key to becoming an entrepreneur is ""just do it.""  Nothing will teach you more about being one than actually doing it.  There is tons of GREAT advice out there but none of it will actually become applicable until you're put in a situation where you need to apply it.<p>Finish your app, start the business on the side, and see where that takes you.  Nothing like market forces to expand your comfort zone for you.  If your business starts taking so much effort and time to iterate that you need to decide between your job and your business, take it as a good sign.  If it fails, so what?  Almost all the big name founders had at least 1 failed businesses before hitting  gold-some of them had multiple failed businesses.",1204312685

126251,comment,126206,126206,0,0,andr,,,"Personally I've never been able to really combine work with startups. You are single-threaded, so to speak, so doing things sequentially (work -> quit -> start company) works better than multi-tasking. Plus, staying on the job gives you too much comfort. Here are four things that I have done or considered doing:<p>1) Try to sell your startup idea to management. Chances are it won't work, but it's worth a try - the company might invest money or people in it. This one actually never worked for me.<p>2) Try to steer your work at the job so it overlaps with your startup. E.g., if you think your startup should use Python, but you don't know it, persuade your boss to use Python for your next work project, so you can get the hang of it. Persuade your company to open source some code that could help you for your startup.<p>3) If you work in a place with good bonuses (50%+ of annual salary), work hard, wait for the bonus and quit. That's what I planned to do, but my hedge fund went bankrupt three months before bonus time. Still, I got a decent settlement, so it worked even better.<p>4) Decide you are quitting, but don't announce it. Become a bad employee. Note that this is immoral, dangerous and potentially illegal, plus faith has its way to play jokes on you, so after you burn the bridges with your boss you might meet her again in a different scenario (e.g., she becomes a VC). Leave the office earlier, start working from home more often (while actually working on your startup), try to take a 1-2 month vacation/sabbatical, etc. Unless you work at a 7-11, you would usually have 2-3 months before management starts coming down on you. This way you can work on a prototype and if two months in you realize it's not worth it, you can still recover things at the job.",1204312528

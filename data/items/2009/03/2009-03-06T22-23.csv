His reasoning is that scalable careers are at the mercy of Black Swans. The vast majority of rewards are distributed to the lucky few at the top. This is not due to any remarkable talent, but luck and the nature of scalable success (it builds upon itself). If you hope to become an author who sells a million copies of a book, you will almost certainly wind up never selling more than a few thousand, while the guy at the top who is no more talented sells millions upon millions.",1236380207

So, I have to say, there are some wonderful intangible benefits to grad school.

Yes, everyone knows PHP is easy to deploy, and it's faster than the ruby/pythons etc. But it's an ugly mess with a long history of security problems and a design that flows against the principles of well designed architecture.

When Linus sat down to start his two-week project, he brought with him an incredibly rich base of experience with real-world merging of changes in a significant, complex codebase with large numbers of contributors.  Also, he's an insightful guy.

506019,comment,505458,505499,0,0,alabut,,,"<i>I think the reason that people today don't care about validation is that perfectly valid code can render differently in the three different rendering engines.</i><p>This is exactly true and the reason is that web standards aren't real standards by the textbook definition of the word, mainly because they lack what's called a ""reference implementation"".<p>I forget where I read it first but the overall gist is that in other fields, say industrial design, a standard typically isn't ratified as finished until the governing body creates an example for everyone else to refer to, the reference implementation, rather than just relying on the written descriptions of how the thing should work. For example, Firewire has a reference implementation that's certified by the IEEE and that hardware makers would refer to when building out the first versions of it. You could grab the example version, plug it in the way it's supposed to, test out the data that's flowing through it, measure what speeds its capable of, etc.<p>Since web standards don't have that reference implementation by the W3C, browser makers are left to their own devices to parse the insanely complicated technical language on their own. And it's only getting worse - the html5 spec is something like 10x the amount of writing as the last version of html. This is one of the biggest reasons why rendering engines have effectively stagnated in the last few years - things are ""good enough"" that they can wait around until the spec makes sense and there's working examples in the real world, and/or they are spending a gazillion hours trying to figure out what the new specs actually mean.<p>This is the problem with functional specs that 37signals rails against when they say that ""<i>Functional specs only lead to an illusion of agreement</i>"":<p><a href=""http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch11_Theres_Nothing_Functional_about_a_Functional_Spec.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch11_Theres_Nothing_Functio...</a><p>This is a super sad state of affairs, and not just in the theoretical sense of how fast the pace of development could be for browser makers today if things were more streamlined, it's also a huge hindrance for developers in the trenches like me. I haven't thought about this for years but I used to relish reading the CSS spec and exploring new ways of pushing my work forward. Trying to read the W3C docs now is like speed reading pig latin - you know there's some cool stuff in there but it hurts your head just to even try hunting for it.",1236377540

I suspect the revision control wars are pretty much over for the next few years, and git won by a large margin.  That, in and of itself, is an interesting indication of Linus' genius...he built something that had dozens of competitors, some with major backing like Canonical's bzr, and within a couple of months it was apparent to just about everyone that git had the mindshare for next generation revision control.

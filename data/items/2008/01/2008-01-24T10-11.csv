Dumb feature request: how about custom subdomains? <a href=""http://subject.linkherd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://subject.linkherd.com/</a> suggests more of a standalone community than linkherd.com/subject .

Especially if I am not located in a startup hub.""<p>I think most talented people would be delighted to work with Scheme. Maybe (hopefully) it is still true that you can use LISP to identify the good programmers. Presumably most people from ""Java School"" would not bother to reply to a job ad asking for LISP knowledge.",1201170460

103407,comment,102863,103177,0,0,Tichy,,,"While we are at it, I was really disappointed when I saw the hashtables in MzScheme. Sorry, but compared to Java they seem quite unelegant, there are not even iterators (though I guess it would be easy to provide them). Maybe there is no better way to do it without objects, I don't know (I am not so well versed in Scheme yet). I just wonder if there are better ""collections"" than that for MzScheme, somewhere.<p>I know it is nitpicking, but ultimately it is about trust, while I am learning: do the implementors of MzScheme have a sense of good style, or not.... Maybe I am just spoiled by having lived in an object oriented world for too long, but it also seems to me that sometimes OO makes sense, simply as a way to structure the code. Also I think it is neat how in Java everything has a ""toHashcode"" method, so you can store everything in a hashmap - how does it even work in Scheme (haven't studied it very close yet, I admit)?",1201170259

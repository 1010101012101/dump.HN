3234114,comment,3233526,3233526,7,0,exDM69,,,"An interesting read. It's always nice to see people stating their unpopular opinions with proper reasoning.<p>The author's point of view seems to be pretty Javascript/Node.js -centric. I can relate. try/catch and node.js -style asynchronous coding do not work together. However, I'd say that it's the async programming model that is broken, not try/catch.<p>Writing code in node.js async style is very difficult for humans to do (at least for me), but compilers are excellent in this type of program transformations (continuation passing style). The Haskell and Erlang compilers and runtimes do this automatically. You write regular imperative code but it's executed in an asynchronous manner using co-operative fibers (maybe together with native os threads).<p>A similar solution is possible with an interpreted language that has some kind of continuations. Every blocking system call could be translated to a co-operative fiber context switch using kqueue/epoll.<p>What is really baffling to me is that none of the popular interpreted languages (javascript, python, ruby) seem to have decent continuations. I don't know of a reason for not implementing continuations in an interpreter, is there any? Using continuations, one could implement pretty nice async operations and exception handling.<p>Using return values for error handling is really painful. I've been writing a system call heavy C program, and about 40% to 50% (in LOC) of the code is error handling. In test code coverage, I can reach just over 50% branch coverage as most error conditions don't happen while testing. I don't know of a nice way to make e.g. the network fail at the right time to test my error handling in that case.<p>C++ is pretty nice when it comes to error handling and exceptions as resources are cleaned up on error. Python's with..as statement or Haskell's Control.Exception.bracket can do the same thing (the latter is just a regular function, not a language builtin). In C, most error handling is required to free some memory you allocated earlier, but even in a garbage collected language you still have system resources you need to free (file handles, sockets, db connections etc).",1321281770

If don't do the first point, you'll end up with multiple causes producing the same error number. If you don't do the second, you'll get ""invalid data"" when parsing json (where? what data? which line? which element? why is it invalid?). If you don't do the third, you're going to crash anyway.<p>So if you don't use exceptions to make your code nicer, you're going to end up implementing the same flow over and over again in places that could just allow the exception to pass through. You might even write some helper/macros functions to... add a file and line number when wrapping previous exception. It feels like reinventing the wheel.<p>Edit: Forgot to mentioned the collection processing in the end.

Flow requires that some conditions hold, one of which is that it is just challenging enough to push conscious thoughts out. I experience flow much more in C++ than in Python, I actually enjoy the complexity. Most people don't get flow from testing because it isn't challenging enough. So what he is doing is lowering the challenge by documenting and removing what he views as ""obstacles."" He is on the right track, being aware of being in flow, what works for him. I imagine there will be a time when the things he mentions will actually knock him out of flow, and instead he will skip over them without thinking about them.",1321279655

In my experience it's not less robust.<p>So my code hasn't had every possible failure case thought through and explicitly handled in advance. That's good. Firstly some of those errors are so rare they'll almost certainly never occur in my program's lifetime; by not having to handle them explicitly and individually I save time and money. Secondly I can guarantee that, no matter how good I think I am, the program will eventually find a way of crashing I'd not considered; this approach gives me a clean means of handling unforeseen errors as well.<p>A bad programmer can write bad code in any pattern and with any tools. A bad C programmer using return values can create so many different standards for how to handle errors that you might as well get out the divining rods to read the code.

Tagging the pointers can be used notify that a node is going to be deleted in order to avoid the ABA problem (as mentioned in the article). Tagging pointers is absolutely essential for more complex lock free data structures, like doubly linked lists.<p>This can also be used in a garbage collector to add a few bits of metadata. In a GC you can (and probably should) decide to use memory objects with proper alignment, which leaves you with a few bits to store data in.

With exceptions, all the work is done for me.

3233935,comment,3233156,3233156,17,0,jbeda,,,"I implemented this in the core data structures for IE5.  We were very memory constrained as we had to run on Win95 machines with something like 12MB of RAM.  I was counting bits.<p>The base level of the tree wasn't really a node DOM but rather a stream of document events (start element, text, end element, etc).  We put these in a binary tree that was balanced as a splay tree.  To drive memory usage down I reduced the {parent, left, right} pointers down to {child, next, left_child_bit, next_is_parent_bit}. 'child' pointed to the the first child.  I knew if it was the left or the right child based on the left_child_bit.  'next' pointed either to the sibling or the parent, depending on the 'next_is_parent_bit'.   However, to really realize the savings, I needed to hide these bits in the pointers themselves.<p>Other tricks that we used to save memory:<p>1) Put rare data into a hash table indexed off of the 'this' pointer of the object.  Have a bit to indicate if it was there or not.  We called these lookaside pointers.<p>2) Embed objects in other objects to save pointers back and forth.  The embedded object would do math on its this pointer (based on bits for which embedded member it is) to get the this pointer of the parent object.<p>I'm not sure, but I suspect that one of the reasons I think that current IE is slower now than it should be is that a lot of these optimizations are no longer necessary and cause more problems than they solve.",1321279400

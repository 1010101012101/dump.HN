I sleep on the top bunk and so I have to jump out of bed just to disable an alarm, or else my roommate starts kicking me through the bedsheet. It's a motivator, all right.

495528,comment,495464,495497,0,0,unalone,,,"I learned that everybody's different, that there's no magic solution for doing any one thing. I learned that most stories and opinions have more than one side to them, and that there isn't necessarily always a right side.<p>I learned that it's important to learn how to speak civilly and clearly - even if you're like me and enjoy being mad at people, there's a time and place for it, and it's rarely when you're talking to people online.<p>I learned that the absolutely most thrilling feeling in the world is making stuff, and that the second-most is talking to somebody that has. I remember, early on, saying something dismissive about Delicious and having one of the programmers respond directly to me. I love meeting the people behind things. I still get a thrill when I get into a conversation with somebody who's built a web site or runs a blog.<p>I think that's also what I learned, which goes with what you said: I learned that the thing I value most in others is what they build and how passionate they are about building it.

495527,comment,495464,495464,0,0,sofal,,,"I've learned a lot about the nature of opinions. There are as many ways to approach a subject as there are people. I've read several comment threads where people were countering each other and yet I couldn't help but upmod both sides because of the excellent points that each side made. It's refreshing to see the different but valid perspectives. It adds color and breadth to understanding. It's also a tad bit intimidating knowing that no matter what I think, some smart person out there can poke holes in it if I try to generalize.<p>I've also learned to react to others' opinions in a more thoughtful and objective manner. The culture here encourages me to consider how people may interpret what I say. People here will listen to you if you speak calmly and rationally, even if you're misguided.<p>It's one thing to read comments written by people who know more about a subject than I do. It's quite another thing to read comments that are crafted with more emotional maturity and wisdom than I would have. That kind of experience just does not happen to me on other social news sites, and it is why I keep coming back here.",1235627291

So I take it for granted now.<p>I think it's good actually.  Now when I'm about to publish something, it's second nature to go through and look at each sentence and ask ""Is this false?

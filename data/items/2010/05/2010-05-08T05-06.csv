1329707,comment,1329334,1329645,0,0,ericd,,,"Keeping a vision intact often does require absolutism. It's helpful to experiment, but in the end, I think a maintainer has to stick to his guns to keep anything from devolving into crap. Guidance from users is often stunningly wrong when taken from a higher vantage point. I hate to keep running back to Jobs, but if he listened to popular opinion and let them guide what he wanted, his products would end up reverting to the mean. Instead he keeps his door ""solidly locked"".<p>To implement search well is not a trivial task at all, and distracts from the much, much more important task of making the community self regulate towards quality. If all you want is a link to site:news.ycombinator.com, then a bookmark should be fine for you and others who do it frequently, and typing it in should be fine for those of us who search infrequently. No additional site complexity needed. If people ask how to search it, then they'll learn a neat and generally useful trick when someone tells them about site:xyz on Google.<p>Edit: And in response to ""he should bring on more people if he's so time-limited"", bringing on more people frequently causes more of a time drain than it solves.",1273298111

I would have a different opinion if Zynga could survive without the Facebook interactions.  However, their games rely on the network effect that Facebook brings... so they are very dependent upon the 'walled garden' of Facebook.<p>Now, this isn't the same type of garden as AOL in the day.  It's more open, but make no mistake, Facebook controls the user, not Zynga.  Because of this, Zynga has more risk than another web-based game company would be.  At the same time though, Zynga has gained incredibly from the relationship.<p>But, if Zynga wants to keep the users coming, it needs to maintain that Facebook relationship.",1273296861

If you send a bug fix or feature patch to the HN arc codebase, he tosses it without looking at it? Or does he look at it and then take a decision whether to include it or not? I would <i>imagine</i> the latter (please correct me if I am wrong).<p>That he refuses to consider some suggestions, no matter how much sense it may make to the person making the suggestion (or even bystanders) is the exact same behaviour that <i>every</i> open source project's BDFL exhibits. I think you exaggerate with the ""door solidly locked to other s contributing"".

If he explains the rationale that is a bonus, but he doesn't really need to. It is his project.<p>If he refuses to incorporate our fixes/suggestions, we (the hacker users of HN) can either go along with his decision xor fork the codebase (or start a new project from scratch using our preferred tools)  and build something better (and I know a couple of HNers who are trying exactly that).",1273295988

Clash of Clans follows a traditional RTS model, building things takes time. Now, they've given you the option to purchase gems to automatically finish buildings.<p>This clearly exploits people's need for instant gratification. However, that need for gratification is up to the user, not the game. The game itself is quite fun and easy without ever spending a dime. There is nothing ""game breaking"" that has to be purchased with real funds. It's one of the truer time = money models out there.",1356094769

4952461,comment,4951717,4952160,4,0,mtgx,,,"I don't think Google is an <i>order of magnitude</i> more trustworthy, but enough to matter - for now. The way Google would be an order of magnitude more trustworthy to me, would be to implement OTR and ZRTP in Google Talk and Hangouts, and to allow private-key encryption for Gmail and Google Drive, done from inside the browser. And of course these options should be right there for you to see when using the service, not buried in deep levels of settings. And they should be on by default, unless there's a technical or UX reason why that's a big negative, like for encrypting e-mails. But for all the other services it should be okay to set encryption on by default.<p>If you had an option to do so from inside the Gmail client, encryption would become much more mainstream. Techdirt [1] and ArsTechnica [2] had some good articles about it, although I disagree with TechDirt that they should offer ""key management"" for users. That would defeat the purpose - unless it's guaranteed to only be done by the browser, locally, and they wouldn't have access to that, and it could be easily verified that they're not lying. I think they sort of do this already for the master-password in Chrome.<p>I don't think these encryption options would hurt their ad-revenue much, and besides - I don't think Google, Microsoft or any other company should scour through my <i>private</i> messages to make their ads more relevant. I don't care how ""anonymous"" or secure they make it. It's okay if it's public data - but private data?

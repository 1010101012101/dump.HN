""--mixed"" is almost meaningless.  ""--soft"" and ""--hard"" are also mostly meaningless.<p>I'm OK with having a low-level primitive like ""reset"" that doesn't have a simple meaning so cannot have a meaningful name. But then, it should be wrapped with meaningful commands such as ""moveto"" with flags to avoid touching index or working tree, and ""unadd"" on top of ""reset"". Then, I don't think anyone would ever use reset directly, so it would probably be phased out :-)",1303124164

If they wanted to, they could up the (in context) risible investment in fusion to get a working reactor up and running by the mid-2020s.  I mean they're talking about investing about $1billion per year for the next 30 years, from the entire planet.  Up that to $5billion, and you can halve the development time.  They really aren't terribly concerned at the moment.<p>On other fronts, Laurence Livermore is starting to get interesting with their inertial fusion designs:\n<a href=""https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/ife/how_ife_works.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/ife/how_ife_works.php</a><p>And of course nanotech may yet allow us to produce the cheap, efficient solar panels that would be needed to use solar as a baseline energy source.

2458584,story,,,2,7,jcr,"Ask HN: Why Support Client-Side (javascript) Scripting?",,"I already know the topic of client-side scripting and plugins is\ncontroversial and my views will be wildly unpopular on HN. It does feel\na bit trollish writing and contemplating posting this, but I would\nreally like to politely understand the other side of the debate, even if\nI might not ever agree with it.<p>With DOM headaches aside, I'll be the first to admit that coding in\njavascript and other client-side execution venues (swflash, java, ...)\ncan be very interesting and a whole lot of fun. Racing motorcycles and\ntrick driving are also a lot of fun. But none of these things are safe\nor smart.<p>If you're on a race track or driving range, the risk your wild\nmotor vehicle fun poses to others is mostly mitigated. In contrast, your\nreckless and hopefully wreckless fun would be extremely dangerous to\nothers if preformed in a shared public place. The world wide web is a\nshared public place.<p>I give due respect to jwz and friends at Netscape for developing\njavascript in a mad rush to prevent Microsoft from cramming a\nproprietary scripting solution into the nascent web. But scripting was a\nhorribly flawed and dangerous idea from the very start.<p>Think about it this way; if browser scripting and plugins did not exist,\nthen the vast majority of browser based exploits would not exist.<p>The most fundamental tenet of system security is, if someone else can\nrun code on your machine, then it is not your machine.  Sure, with java,\njavascript, swf and similar, there is supposed to be a ""sandbox"" where\nscripts can play safely, but in reality, a sandbox is where dumb kids\nplay and cats crap.<p>Sandboxing has failed, and failed, and failed. It violates the most\nfundamental tenet of system security so it will never work. The reality\nis unfortunate, and means less-fun coding, but ignoring reality is\nputting other people in jeopardy.<p>The web would be much safer if it was merely a way to transfer and\ndisplay data, rather than a way to transfer and execute code. It\ncertainly is possible to mess up data handling in exploitable ways, but\nthe reduction of complexity and avoidance of execution would most likely\nbe more secure than what we have today. The web as it exists with\nscripting and plugins is a classic example of failing to think through\nthe implications of a decision to determine if the idea can be abused\nand if the risks are worth the rewards.<p>I'm sure the vast majority of HN is not concerned since you consider\nyourself technically proficient enough to avoid the dangers of\nscripting and plugins. Unfortunately, you're wrong. Worse yet, you're\nbeing horribly inconsiderate to the rest of the population including the\npeople you supposedly care about like your mom who hates computers.<p>Have you ever had the ""pleasure"" of trying to show a non-technical\nfriend how to use noscript after they got owned, or did you just let\nthem fend for themselves?<p>Letting <i>MY</i> idea of fun put others in jeopardy is more than just\nirresponsible and unfair, it's entirely unconscionable. I just hope the\n""unpopular"" view on scripting and plugins comes to mind the next time\nsomeone you care about gets owned, tracked or manipulated through a web\nbrowser. I won't pull out the thread-bare rhetoric of, ""Part of the\nsolution or part of the problem,"" or worse, ""For us or against us,"" but\nI will wave my hand and suggest that you want to go home and rethink\nyour life.<p>Though I refuse to deployed it, I've played with javascript a lot, and\nenjoyed it, so I guess I'm part of the problem too. I certainly don't\nthink you're ""evil"" for supporting or using javascript or any of the\nother client-side execution venues, but I do believe you are making a\nmistake in supporting the status quo of putting others at risk\nunnecessarily. I believe we can do better than client-side execution,\nand I believe we can do better at keeping our friends and families safe.<p>If you're already rethought your life and have a viable reason for\nputting others at risk, I'd like to know and understand your reason. On\nthe other hand, if your reasoning boils down to just profiting and\ncompeting, or everybody does it, then you really don't want to sell me\nany death sticks.<p>And lastly, yes, maybe I'm just too old and pine for the imaginary\nbetter days long past when things were a lot more simple. It might be\njust nostalgic or formally provable, but keeping it simple at least\n<i>seems</i> easier to secure.",1303123020

In less than 20 years, simple economics are going to force us to a solution of full electric cars for urban use, and hybrids for longer trips, with the hybrid normally being charged from the wall, but using oil-based fuels for longer trips (or when the owner forgot to charge the car overnight).

The other big annoyance with the VC is that the blade needs to be off to add more virtual NICs - so now I normally just add them all when I provision the blade and leave them disconnected.<p>The c7000's also seem quite picky about the versions of firmware installed on the various components.<p>I believe you can chain several c7000's together for management to reduce the pain a little. And you can always invest in HP's management software.<p>A plus for the c7000's is the flexibility of the blades: you can get HPUX versions (if you're unlucky enough to need HPUX), half and double height versions. Using the different sized blades does require some planning, as they impose some constraints - but even with this it does introduce some flexibility.<p>I used Dell's bladecenters a few years ago and they were okay, I know IBM/Fujitsu/ have them as well, so I wouldn't say there is no competition in the market.<p>I played with a UCS system (just one chassis) in our lab (~6-12 months ago), and I can't say I was hugely impressed. The documentation wasn't what I expect given my experience with Cisco's switch gear, and we had to update the firmware a couple of times to get past bugs. Maybe this is no longer the case. I didn't play with the API.<p>It's my understanding that if you want to do multihop FCoE then you have to stick with the same vendor for your switches, due to the different ways they implement FCoE.<p>IMHO I think the UCS cost is a big turnoff, maybe if you're in a huge environment (100's of chassis) the API is enough of a win to overcome the high cost - or maybe you can get a big enough discount.<p>WRT to Cisco staying in the market, I think they will for two reasons. The first is it increases their ability to sell more switch gear - you want FCoE or better link utilisation then, you need data center ethernet, which means you need new switches - and Cisco can now sell you both. Secondly it allows them to push FCoE and disrupt the FC market, which means they can sell more switches again.",1303122004

This is entirely irrational.<p>It's not about utility.  He took place in a market transaction by selling his time.  He was happy because he liked the arrangement.  Then he found out his happiness was based on a lie; he wasn't getting market rate for his ""product"", far from it.  It is not even remotely irrational to suddenly be angry when you find out you were tricked.  I'm begging to wonder if you actually know what ""rational"" means.<p>>it is happiness that should not be so intricately tied to money.<p>Fine, and I would say it <i>isn't</i> in this case.

Not being happy anymore when you discover the deception doesn't mean your happiness is ""tied intricately to money"".  Your happiness stemmed from trust and now a betrayal has been discovered.

You have to work in your own best interest or you negatively impact others.  For example, if you happily donate your time at 10% of the market rate then you've lowered the value of that job and now others may get paid less.<p>And why is it that you only call out workers?  What about Google?  They've got billions, surely they could charge less for their advertising?  What about CEO's?  They make more than they could spend in a lifetime.

Look at the way you use water as a metaphor, but use it to mean simultaneously (1) the money supply (increasing/decreasing), and (2) the wave-like boom-bust flow of economic activity.<p>Conflating these things leads you to paradoxical statements like ""no new water is created"" when you are taking about governments increasing the money supply. Or the way you say ""all the splashing is magnifying the distortions"" when this is theoretically impossible: preventing deflation by printing money cannot cause worse deflation by definition.<p>What I think you want to argue is that MAN-MADE changes to the money supply are bad. But not only is this empirically wrong (read about ""The Great Moderation""), it brings us back to the point that Keynes made above, when he asserted through a very simple analogy that there is no such thing as a natural economy as long as your idea of one is based around a currency (like gold) the supply of which can only be increased by digging it out of the ground. In this situation you CANNOT be worse off by having your government increase the money supply, because market forces will slowly encourage people to ""print more money"" themselves by just digging it out of the ground. Which means we're all better off to skip the shoveling and spend the labor on building an airport or something with at least the potential for social return.<p>My contact information is in my profile -- I'd be happy to carry this on over email if you'd like to continue.

They sell touch keypads and keyboards (TouchStream LP). I have a Touchstream LP (<a href=""http://motionobj.com/blog/new-found-minimalism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://motionobj.com/blog/new-found-minimalism</a>). It still works excellently after 6-7 years now.<p>It's a flat surface keyboard with no physical buttons. Besides typing on it, a key thing you can do is gestures, like dragging/expanding out 5 fingers to zoom in, pinching the middle finger and thumb to cut (cut as in cut-and-paste). The gestures are configurable. A basic configuration is switching between Windows, Linux and OS X modes, since the gestures implicitly needs to invoke Cmd/Ctrl, etc. The built-in software (no installation required) depends typos and tries to correct them to compensate for the flat typing surface.<p>If you use the iPhone and/or newer macbooks/macbook pros, you will recognise that some (I would say only the most basic so far) of this technology have made it there. So if they did acquire this excellent company (which sadly, cause the keyboard to be no longer available on the market, except ebay), it's reasonable to expect more usage of their technology, and its original form - keyboards and keypads. In its current form, you need quite a bit of practice to type well, but who knows how they can improve on it.",1241074701

586497,comment,586169,586169,0,0,iigs,,,"There is a cognitive gap here:<p><i>Those of us who were in law enforcement in New York City in the late '80s and early '90s remember how drug dealers pioneered the use of 9-mm guns. We heard over and over from our friends in the police department that they were outgunned, that their service revolvers were no match for semi-automatics in a shootout. So what did the police do? The New York City Police Department finally bought 9-mms, too. It was a classic arms race, with the gun manufacturers in the economically enviable position of selling bigger and better guns to both sides.</i><p>So the proposal, then, is to restrict the government from escalating the arms race by either creating policies or internal politics in such a way that the police can't purchase the weapons that they otherwise would?<p>""Police friendly"" arms manufacturers would continue to sell guns that they think the police want. They're expensive, dated, and proprietary. This is roughly analogous to the state of government tech procurement before the large push for open systems. They will always be behind the curve because they will have no market for their innovative designs since their hands will be tied compared to ""police unfriendly"" manufacturers.<p>The police were behind the 8-ball because they failed to innovate. If you take the divisive stigma of firearms out of the picture and look at it as a strategic game, it seems obvious to me that messing with the incremental demand of one (albeit large) customer isn't going to bend the industry to your will.<p><i>The Obama White House recently made it clear—abandoning a campaign pledge—that it won't push for a legislative ban on the sale of assault weapons. Yet a series of provocative recent events has revived the gun debate: the international tension arising from Mexican drug gangs using guns purchased at American stores, the 10th anniversary of Columbine, and a Supreme Court case invalidating a District of Columbia law prohibiting the possession of guns at home.</i><p>Let's enumerate these events:<p>1) A foreign country has problems sealing its borders at both ends. Drugs on the south and firearms, allegedly, on the north. It's interesting to point out that the automatic weapons that the Mexican gangs are using are incredibly hard to find in stores here -- they're not the guns you buy at a rural Wal-Mart. It also conveniently ignores the elephant in the room -- pervasive corruption of Mexican officials.<p>2) Tenth anniversary of a tragedy. Referring to Columbine as a ""recent"" event is incredibly disingenuous.<p>3) Supreme court case invalidating an unconstitutional law. The letter of the law was upheld but you'd endeavor to attack the spirit of it?<p>This is a shameful attempt to take Obama to task on, frankly, a minor component of his platform at a time when he inherited a complex and severe economic mess unheard of in generations, if ever.",1241073895

If I see a story in the media about this sort of thing, I'll read it. And where I live, there's the infamous Pacific Mall which often has shanzhai items of all sorts. But I'm by no means a mobile expert. You'd be better off asking around at howardforums.com or something. I mainly got interested in the topic because a few years back I had a friendly bet with a friend who works at an Asian mega-corp which makes cellphones that they should start paying attention to Apple. But they had their attention on the knock-offs instead.<p>They were totally caught flat-footed by the iPhone. Apparently their last annual meeting fell just after the launch of the iPhone 3G. When their cellphone head honcho got up to talk, apparently he took a visible sigh and essentially admitted that the high-end market, which they want to be in during the recession (focus on profit margins not unit sales) was essentially stolen from them by Apple, and that their growth numbers in this segment had been slashed. They're essentially ceding the market to Apple in the short term while they go back to the drawing board and try to get the software part right. In other words, what Apple did to them in the MP3 player market is happening to them in the cellphone market. Keep this in mind the next time somebody tells you it's foolish to think that iPhone OS won't be the defacto mobile platform in 3 years time.",1241073867

586472,comment,585818,586183,0,0,tolmasky,,,"I hate to have to step in here, but I feel that I should now. The entire purpose of this blog post was to show how cool the WebKit profiler is, highlighting some of its new features that we all worked on together and at the same time teaching people how to better use a tool they probably weren't familiar with. However, the highest rated discussion here on news.yc is now quibbling over who deserves credit for what. The worst part is that no one seems to be arguing that the post itself was unfair, its simply the title of this particular News YC posting that is of such great concern.<p>If its that important to ""set the record straight"", then I have to say that the heavy view was indeed completely broken prior to this change. The heavy view used to completely miscalculate <i>all</i> child nodes, adding up there corresponding individual times instead of how much time the root node used. This is completely opposite to both the way gprof works as well as Shark. On top of this, as you mentioned, recursive times were counted several times over, never reporting them correctly and often resulting in profiling times of over 1000%. This is not a trivial matter since most of the major javascript libraries contain recursion or call cycles of some sort. The end result is that the heavy view could not be trusted at all when measuring a script's runtime. This is important because the heavy view is what is closest to Firebug's current behavior, so it was not feasible for someone to make the switch from using Firebug to WebKit before this point since they couldn't ask trivial questions like ""which function is taking the longest"" and expect a correct answer. Thus, the logic for this feature was completely rewritten and behaves 100% differently than before. True, most of it was done in JavaScript instead of C++, but it wasn't ""simply display code"". We actually investigated the implementations in gprof and asked our buddies over on the Shark team what the correct behavior should be and coded it up. The reason we chose to do this almost entirely in JavaScript instead of C++ was to make this code more accessible to existing JS people who might also want to pitch in. I think this is really key because a lot of people contribute to Firebug because its in a language they already know and are familiar with. JavaScript code should not immediately be assumed to be a ""trivial"" portion of a program.<p>All in all, I think boucher's reasoning behind this seemingly crucial title was to get people excited about the ""enhanced"" WebKit profiler, not to somehow imply the WebKit team has never done any work on this problem before or something. I'm not sure that many people would have cared that much if he'd written ""minor/some bug fixes to safari profiler"", especially if they had already encountered some of these bugs in the past and had been turned off by them initially, not to mention that the changes were indeed pretty significant.<p>Trust us, we know the frustration. We love WebKit at 280 North and are constantly saddened to hear that a lot of people don't even know about any of WebKit's truly great debugging facilities.",1241071942

863776,comment,863224,863553,0,0,elblanco,,,"It's amazing to me to still see the RDF semantic web drum beating even after its proven itself to be a failure. It's not that the idea is bad, or even that the syntax lacks sugar, but it fails on three fronts:<p>1) People have to use it. It is completely possible to build pretty much any modern service you want, without RDF. The only thing RDF buys you for your trouble is some vague hand waving about joining the semantic web, for which no really useful services exist as exemplars of why you'd take the time and expense of building the RDF meta-data in the first place.<p>2) It's easier to do it the many wrong ways than it is to do it the couple of right ways. So I bothered to build a triple that says ""the sky/has the color/blue"" and somebody else does ""the sky/is/blue"" and somebody else does ""the sky/is/sky-blue"" and on and on. I've quickly arrived back at the same problem that the semantic web was supposed to solve, finding information. But instead of information, now I have an infinite list of qualities of the sky to deal with.<p>3) On single documents, the RDF data is generally crud. Other meta-data (e.g. topics, key words, summaries, entities, etc.) are far more useful than a bunch of ham-handed XML jamming up the meta-data of my document.<p>The field itself lies at a certain kind of problem. The claim is ""if we have enough semantically described data, we can do all kinds of great reasoning things with them"". The problem is that there will never be enough semantically described data. At least not in the direction the field is going. Spending millions of man years building out triple-store databases just isn't really a terribly useful endeavor. Particularly when all I want to do is a find a web page about dancing dogs and dudes getting kicked in the nuts. The field itself describes all of its problems as ""we just need more data"". It's like the uncanny valley hypothesis. ""These robots aren't human enough yet because we just haven't spent enough time making them real"". When ultimately nobody cares if their robot house maid looks like a human, they just want it to take out the trash.<p>Even if, by some miracle the world went mad for a year and RDF'd all of its web output. The result will <i>still</i> be only marginally more useful than the search systems we have today.",1254819182

863774,comment,863435,863613,0,0,idiopathic,,,"> Americans have become accustomed to cheap product, and gas, while at the same time turning a nose up at menial jobs<p>I understand that cheap gas is bad for environment, but why are the other items in your list bad? Everyone who is doing a menial job wishes they could afford to turn a nose up it, and cheap products are great. Even cheap gas is good for Americans (apart from the environmental damage) because it means freedom of movement as transportation is so affordable.",1254819132

863771,comment,863007,863674,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Also, ""deregulation"" is a buzzword intended to frame the debate and make you believe that they are reducing regulation and therefore creating some kind of free market.<p>Most so-called deregulation could be better termed re-regulation, it's just changing the rules to benefit different parties, not abolishing them.<p>(Having said that, <i>btilly</i> above uses <i>deregulation</i> in its new derogatory sense, much like the euphamism <i>downsizing</i> had to be replaced with <i>rightsizing</i> once everyone realised it still meant redundancies. Relatedly the depression was named that by people who thought it wouldn't be as bad as a proper recession, now <i>depression</i> means <i>a really bad recession</i>)",1254818940

Linux was a personal project of Linus Torvalds initially commenced for private learning purposes.<p>Of course, it's impossible to know how certain events would have effected certain other things, but it seems that there's not much that could have happened in the market that would have stopped Linux's actual creation.<p>Its domination, however, is a different story; I'm sure if Windows was an open platform there would have been relatively little attraction to Linux and it would have burned out in the same obscurity that it was born from.

It's easy enough to pull reasons from the air and vet them, but that's just an advanced form of straw man arguments. You'll never get anywhere like that.<p>I know that if there is a factory making something in Germany and not one here that for some reason the economics work better in Germany. Lots of really smart people who add and subtract numbers are paid to make these decisions based on where the numbers work the best. That's their job. That's the only thing they're supposed to do well, and they're good at it. You can bet there's an economic reason somewhere.",1254818465

863762,comment,863018,863266,0,0,Torn,,,"I've had Five Finger Sprints for about a year now, and have been heavily evangelising them to my friends. Running barefoot really does feel liberating, especially going off-road through parks, fields and trails. It's like being a kid again and definitely bought the fun back into running for me. I can really hammer out the miles with them now, zero sore legs or calves. :)<p>It took me about a month of a few runs per week (20-30 mins) to adjust -- so not long at all. One of the mistakes I made at the start was going too far, too fast: I tried to do my usual 1h+ runs straight away in the Vibrams and was pushing-off from the ground, concentrating on staying on the balls of my feet. Bad idea.<p>Anyway, here's some tips from someone who has been through it:<p>---------------------------------<p>- Relax, relax, relax.<p>- Don't push off from the ground, rather, concentrate on lifting your thighs.<p>- Don't aim to balance on the balls of your feet. You're not running on tip-toes, and that's going to put insane strain on your calves. Instead, get the general area of the top half of your foot to land first, almost flat-footed is fine.<p>- Aim to tap the ground with your feet about 2-3 times a second, as if your feet are going in a circular motion, and passing by the ground. It's like you're incidentally propelling yourself along with gentle touches to the ground.<p>- Keep hips relatively low, legs relaxed, leaning slightly forward. If your calves start to hurt, then relax more.<p>- You will get sore calves as your feet and leg muscles get used to the new style of running. Stick with it, and don't overdo it.",1254818359

Having said that, I haven't seen a lot of teams that use it and continue using it for a competitive advantage -- and that sets off alarm bells. The hype may very well be ahead of reality on this one.

However, a weaker dollar can mean more factories stay here for competing cheap labor. The trade-off is less spending power, which means our economy must shift away from being spending based.

863743,comment,863481,863481,0,0,patio11,,,"My take on this: yes, it is targeted at poor consumers.  They're almost certainly going to receive objectively worse terms than people who are smarter, savvier, and (not unrelated to those two) richer.  This happens in many, many things poor people buy.<p>There are a lot of folks whose actions are responsible for this state of affairs.  Its interesting that while responsibility is diffuse, blame gets concentrated pretty acutely on particular participants in the value chain.<p>For example, I can't remember the last time someone blamed jewelry vendors for the plight of poor people.  Poor people spend more as a percentage of income on jewelry than any other socio-economic group.  Poor people have more of their assets tied up in jewelry than any other socio-economic group.<p>Its interesting to me -- and I mean that, interesting, not the passive-aggressive way of saying ""y'all are stupid"" -- that we go after Cash4Gold for offering $12.50 for $75 worth of gold when we don't go after Kay Jewelers for selling the $300 brooch the gold is in.  Cash4Gold is seen as cheating the poor customer out of $62.50, but Kay Jewelers is just an honest businessman who made $225 off of selling the bauble in the first place.<p>More broadly: a portion of the attraction to jewelry for poor customers is that it is a value store and access to short-term credit for people who are unbanked.  (If you own a $300 bauble from Kay's then you have a $100 line of credit at your local pawn shop which charges you APRs of $STAGGERING_PERCENT.)  Jewelry is a TERRIBLE alternative to banking services.<p>Incidentally: jewelry is a consumption item.  Don't buy it with the intention of it having resale value.  Don't buy it if you can't afford it.",1254816358

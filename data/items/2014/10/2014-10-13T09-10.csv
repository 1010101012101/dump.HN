Sure, you have some guise of anonymity, but ultimately you&#x27;re probably transporting over TCP/IP and so you can look at the IP sender field to figure out who&#x27;s data you&#x27;re storing. Obviously this is a huge problem if some malicious person decides they want to corrupt or delete all files stored by certain entities.<p>Vitalik Buterin of ethereum worte an excellent blog post addressing all of these concerns.

Having had some experience with other web-related companies, most german software is written with german content first, and little thought spent on localization, since serving an audience outside of germany is risky in that it means a lot of the company (support, etc.) has to be duplicated first, and it might end up having little draw. On the flipside, most Perl web frameworks are build with only one language in mind, English. Adding localization is extremely easy if you start out with it in mind, and i&#x27;ve actually been working on tools to ease that process, but after the fact it&#x27;s a massive investment.<p>Due to all these factors the cost is simply too high for most german companies to even try.",1413193988

8448083,comment,8444953,8446849,0,0,exDM69,,,"I agree that F1 is not very easy to enjoy for the casual observer. You have to spend time trying to understand what happens behind the scenes to get the most out of it.<p>If you look at individual races, it might sometimes be a bit boring. The Russian GP yesterday was the most boring race in a very long time.<p>The first thing to understand is that that F1 is a driving <i>and</i> car building competition. There are two championships going on, the constructors&#x27; and the drivers&#x27; trophies are separate and sometimes involves a conflict of interest between the driver and the team. Every car is different from each other and the changes between races can be pretty significant.<p>A second thing to understand is that the competition lasts for the entire year, from March until November. Even though the past years one team has been dominant (Merc this year, Red Bull previous years), there&#x27;s a big &quot;best of the rest&quot; competition going on.<p>A third thing to understand is that a Grand Prix lasts for the entire weekend. If things go wrong on Friday, it will have consequences on Sunday. If the weather changes, all bets are off. If you really want to see drivers earning their money, watch some Friday practice sessions. The car setups are off, lots of changes may be made and usually there&#x27;s quite a lot of interesting background information discussed by the commentators.<p>Individual F1 races may be a bit boring for the uninitiated but it is the best drivers in the world driving the most sophisticated racing cars ever built. You might have to be a hard core racing geek to get the most out of it... but I am and I definitely enjoy it.",1413193724

8448076,comment,8446232,8447987,0,0,jcrites,,,"I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s fair to say email over TLS is really common yet. It&#x27;s getting there, but Google&#x27;s email encryption in transit transparency report shows that only 57% of inbound messages to Gmail were sent over TLS. Outbound 72%. <a href=""https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/saferemail/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/saferemail/</a> (this is largely concerning server-to-server communication, rather than client-server, but server-server communication happens whenever emails are sent across domains).<p>To be fair those inbound reports are potentially bloated by a lot of spam that no one reads or cares about. It would be interesting if Google disclosed what percentage of messages that end up being read are sent over TLS (or non-spam messages generally). But we can also see that several top 10 sending domains do not support TLS at all (adsender.us, constantcontact.com, grouponmail.*, sailthru.com - mostly advertisers). Luckily the top receiving domains support TLS (which look like other big-name ISPs).<p>Compared to website TLS, email TLS as commonly implemented has two significant challenges beyond these percentages. First, since TLS is established by the STARTTLS extension protocol within an existing plaintext SMTP connection, it&#x27;s easy for an attacker who can modify communication to force it to remain in plaintext (simply don&#x27;t advertise the TLS capability). Second, that previous attack is hardly even necessary: most email senders are willing to establish connections to receivers who present self-signed certificates. The same scenario when browsing a website will show a security warning and recommendation not to continue. The reasoning goes: it&#x27;s better to use TLS even with a self-signed cert than fall back to plaintext. There&#x27;s no human involved who can make a judgment call to abort, like there is when browsing a website. So, while email TLS with self-signed certs may be helpful against passive dragnet surveillance, it&#x27;s little defense an attacker who can intercept and modify the communication: the attacker can simply present his own self-signed cert instead, and the email will flow.<p>Solution ideas: Devise a standard by which messages can be stamped &quot;TLS only or don&#x27;t send&quot;, and another standard by which domains can declare their intention to support TLS. Senders will remember that the domain is TLS-enabled and refuse to fall back to plaintext; and will require a certificate from a reputable CA under either protocol.",1413193381

While exposure is easy to set, scantime is pretty much hardcoded and depends on the physical characteristics of the camera. Even an analog shutter has a scantime on small exposure times.",1413191620

It was about Game Jam, a failed reality show that Zoe and other developers were upset about being on. At the time, Nathan and Zoe were professional acquaintances. He quoted blog posts written by Zoe and others involved in the show. Shortly after that, in early April, Nathan and Zoe began a romantic relationship. He has not written about her since. Nathan never reviewed Zoe Quinn&#x27;s game Depression Quest, let alone gave it a favorable review.</i><p>Nor does it excuse the fact that she was actually covered by Patricia Hernandez, a close friend of hers, a long while back without disclosure either. The update at the bottom happened after the fallout.[2]<p>The harassment that she received that prompted her game to be taken down from Steam Greenlight in Particia&#x27;s article was also proven to be false.[3]<p>Unfortunately, since Wikipedia&#x27;s WikiProject Feminism is brigading the article (which is now locked) <a href=""http://puu.sh/bZri1/121afb137b.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://puu.sh/bZri1/121afb137b.png</a><p>The only other source of a decent timeline is <i>KnowYourMeme</i> of all places.[3]<p>The escapist at the very least decided to apologize for reporting on her original harassment on Steam Greenlight without doublechecking[4]<p><i>&quot;But to explain is not to excuse. Our editor-in-chief, Greg Tito, having reviewed the facts at hand, concluded we ourselves have been imperfect in maintaining journalistic standards. A particularly problematic article, the one which generated his review, was about the alleged harassment of an indie developer by a forum community which denied the allegations but was itself victimized as a result of them. The article failed to cite the harassment as alleged, failed to give the forum community an opportunity present its point of view, and did not verify the claims or secure other sources. Mr. Tito has personally updated the article and spoken to all our editors about the importance of adhering to standards that will prevent such bad incidents from happening again.&quot;</i><p>[1]<a href=""http://kotaku.com/in-recent-days-ive-been-asked-several-times-about-a-pos-1624707346"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kotaku.com/in-recent-days-ive-been-asked-several-time...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://kotaku.com/depression-quest-the-thoughtful-game-about-mental-heal-1476630988"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kotaku.com/depression-quest-the-thoughtful-game-about...</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/quinnspiracy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/quinnspiracy</a><p>[4]<a href=""http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate.4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/ed...</a><p><i>Even the most polite and level-headed Gamergate fans seem to spend far more energy defending the Gamergate name than they do attacking actual corruption.

697582,comment,697329,697544,0,0,Shooter,,,"A GOOD real estate agent performs various professional tasks requiring expertise that save you time and money, protect your interests, and keep you out of trouble, at a cost that is less than doing it yourself.  Kind of like a GOOD lawyer (I noticed your JD) or a good accountant.  You can do it yourself...just like you can fix your own car or plumbing, but the results may not always be what you intended.  It may SEEM like a super simple task until you're knee deep in shit and then you start to appreciate why there are professionals with training who stay up-to-date and have E&O insurance for the field, etc.  Specialization is a good thing.<p>The bar to get a real estate license is lower than getting most other professional licenses, though, so there are many more BAD agents than bad plumbers/accountants/mechanics.

Although we are flattered by the comparisons to the amazing work Google is doing on Wave, it's true that we are lacking some of the innovative features Wave provides (open protocol, federation, Operational Transformation data sync).<p>That said Shareflow was conceived of without any knowledge that Google was working on Wave and developed with limited resources on a tight timeline. When we kicked off the project earlier this year, we discussed our ideal vision for Shareflow which looked a lot like wave (open protocol, federation, pluggable widget architecture, integration with external sites); however, as a small team focused on becoming profitable, we decided to focus on getting a product out there for people to use first.<p>The day Google Wave was announced there was a mix of excitement, tech envy and some frustration in the office about Google releasing something similar to what we had envisioned. Now we are looking forward to the possibilities that Wave opens. A company of Google's size has the ability to push paradigm shifting innovations and new standards. As people become used to new forms of communication and collaboration I believe there will be more opportunity for products like Shareflow. The fact that Google is making Wave an open system means there will hopefully be an ecosystem of products communicating on this emerging standard. As a company focused on innovating in personal and group communication, we're following it closely.<p>We're continuing to build out Shareflow based on our users feedback.

697511,comment,697360,697459,0,0,sho,,,"Exactly what I was thinking. On a box with a decent amount of memory, MySQL's query cache will easily handle 5k/sec or, probably, quite a bit more. From fuzzy memory of a friend's test earlier this year I think he got about 30k/sec over a socket connection and a little less over tcp; sounds about right to me. And that's nothing but MySQL, default installation, on an iMac. Just make sure you have plenty of memory, that's always the key.<p>SPOF concerns could be alleviated by having a standard master/slave failover setup. You might have other needs you haven't mentioned but otherwise sounds like MySQL can handle your needs for now, and keeping the setup as simple and off-the-shelf as possible is always a good thing ..",1247227530

You'll likely have to put a caching layer in front of it if this is still [1] the case. There is already some [2] HTTP accessibility for HDFS, I'm again not 100% clear on its status but if it works well enough a nice caching proxy  (varnish) with plenty of memory should help with latency on heavily-accessed files.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nabble.com/Using-HDFS-to-serve-www-requests-td22725659.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nabble.com/Using-HDFS-to-serve-www-requests-td227...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5010"" rel=""nofollow"">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5010</a>",1247227287

3843113,comment,3832269,3835552,1,0,ygjb,,,"It would be pretty easy to build a tool to route around that type of law.  I create a service that encrypts blobs of data (encryptmyblo.bs), and uses a (publicly defined somewhere) postMessage API to communicate that blob to and from a key value store provided by a third party. I have my friend set up a key value store service provider that stores and retrieves blobs (storemyblo.bs), including the facility to search for stored blobs of data based on binary strings.<p>Because the services exchange those KVPs via a postMessage API, neither service is <i>actually</i> communicating with one another directly or have a formal association.  The user is effectively (via the browser) moving the data from one service to another.  Since EncryptMyBlo.bs doesn't store any data, and StoreMyBlo.bs doesn't have visibility into the data, neither service would be in violation of those requirements.",1334476662

3843111,comment,3842546,3842546,1,0,superkinz,,,"I'm a founder of GroupTalent, so we've seen a lot on this specific topic...<p>I'd say the two biggest challenges for hackers who want to take projects is lead-generation and sales. They sound simple, but they aren't and you'll waste a lot of time talking to a lot of tire-kickers.<p>For lead-gen, that just means finding work. Where do you start? There's a few ways to go, you can network with friends, college alumni, startup circles. You could contact incubator companies and ask if they need any extra help, etc. I have to mention GroupTalent too because this is one of the biggest problems we solve.<p>When it comes to sales, you don't land projects just because you've got ""software developer"" in your job title. It still comes down to convincing them that you're not going to botch the project, and that's based on what you've done before. They want to see examples of your work, including anything at hackathons (those are good examples of how quickly you can crank out prototypes). The closer it is to what they've done the better because buyers don't buy you, they buy the thing you'd be building them. It's easier to visualize success with you if they see something close.<p>On the question of whether to work by yourself or as a team, I'd say go as a team. I've seen first hand that not only will you be happier working with a friend, but the idea of getting a package is a big perk for clients. Speed is often a big deal for them, and 2 is faster than one.<p>Also, clients gravitate towards hackers who can build web apps, not as much static sites. Anybody can code up css/html, but can you build functioning prototypes? Push that as your core skill-set and you'll have a better chance at finding gigs.<p>Most developers and designers <i>hate</i> spending half their time shmoozing, networking, meeting and dealing with people who just want to meet for the free advice. It just sort of comes with the territory. In the end, success will come from getting access to the right clients, and traditionally that has meant knowing the right people. This is one of the reasons we're building what we are.<p>Lastly, don't take projects you aren't interested in. When you're building your own product, and working on the side, it needs to be interesting enough that you can power through the finish and earn the paycheck regardless of what's happening with your company.<p>Oh and one more thing, payment can be a huge hassle. Make sure to establish payment terms before starting or you might get burned. I know folks who just don't get paid. We make project owners pay up front for teams, we hold it in escrow, and pay out on a per sprint basis. If you want to do something similar on your own without an escrow-like service, you might do half up front before a sprint starts, and then half after each sprint. But seriously, break it down into sprints that deliver functionality costing no more than $5k. More sprints at lower cost is better, it's easier to get them to pay for $3k + $4k +$5k know what I mean? It's progressive cost increase for progressive emotional commitment. Otherwise things have a tendency to go unchecked, and then people change their minds, and it's wasted work, and oh should we pay for that or not, etc etc.<p>If you have any questions, tweet me @superkinz",1334476621

3843099,comment,3842734,3842734,2,0,salimmadjd,,,"So what the paper proposes I proposed roughly in 1994.  My view of the world changed after taking quantum physics in college (I was a science major). I have always been obsessed by time so couple of years later during the winter break I spent a lot of time in deep thoughts and everything came together.<p>I don't believe time exist as we have been thought. Time is a metric for rate of change (basically what these guys are suggesting at core) and nothing more.<p>Our perception of the world (cyclical orbit) and recollection (memory) creates our notion of the time.<p>Also based on my original proposal, time (or rate of change) is an average rate of change. However that depends on the sample size. If you take the sample size as the entire universe you get a very predictable rate of change.<p>But as your sample size gets smaller (very small system) then that rate of change becomes more uncertain (see where I'm going)<p>Also if you are in a spaceship (that becomes your sample size)  and your velocity effects the rate of change in your sample size. The same with high gravity.<p>Gravity (especially at extreme level) can greatly dampen or constraint the rate of change (again slowing down of time)<p>Also based on my proposal it's probabilistically plausible for time (or rate of change) to stop. However that probability becomes very small as your sample size increases. Basically change is inevitable by probability since the universe is in constant state of change. As a result time progresses or move forward since that's the most probable condition.<p>Sorry for the long rambling. I know most of you will probably hate my comment. I can fully understand it. We have been thought through all of our schooling how to deal with time. But once you see time from the perspective of a metric for rate of change, then your view of the world will never be the same again.<p>I also proposed that once this new view of time becomes widely accepted and more importantly when we began to have young generation of science students and scientists enter science with this view of the world, we will see complete rethinking and revision of many our of physics laws giving us a new view of science and basically leapfrogging our rate of scientific progress.<p>I also believe the unifying laws of physic resides in this view of time.",1334475473

I still believe a healthy business can flourish on it, but it requires a few ingredients:<p><pre><code>    - a great team
    - vision (more important than you may think)
    - timing/market demand
    - great sales/marketing
    - will to endure lots of crap

Also I tend to announce any moves, like ""my wallet is in my back pocket, reaching for it with my left hand"", which is overly cautious, but subtly communicates to the officer that you are familiar with police procedures and concerns.  You can usually see him visibly relax, at which point it's likely the interaction will be more pleasant.  Don't volunteer more information than necessary, but answer questions politely and clearly.  (usually, it's just ""license and registration."" and then ""do you know why I stopped you"" ""no officer""...)<p>I've gotten >120mph written at 80mph in a 70mph by doing this, several times (I-5 + V8 + empty road...), which can be traffic-schooled.  I don't care about a $150 ticket, I care about potentially getting the car impounded for reckless driving, or a vehicle search, or points.",1334474240

They know something is scrolling because they see the data changing -- a flip / slide / other animation is not necessary.<p>In fact I think it interferes with UX because it's harder to  quickly read the list -- you need to wait for the animation before reading the text. The only exception to this is Skew (because the item text is always visible),  but even that is harder to read than just a normal list without the animation.<p>Very impressive demonstration of CSS3, but just because you can doesn't mean you should.",1334474083

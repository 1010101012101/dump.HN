Afaict, it also includes a lot of people that truly believe that sort of thing is just around the corner.  There's also a psychological trick there too: all their planning begins to look a bit odd if everything is smooth sailing, so I think there's an incentive to start ""believing"".  There is a significant portion of these folks that is 'fringe', and some in what I consider unhealthy ways.<p>Anyway, the short version: the guys behind that site set of some warning flags in my mind, and I would be less inclined to believe they're doing serious science.

Small government != the doing away of all social programs.<p>""yeah, we'd be much better off if all these programmers we hire from state schools weren't able to afford an education.""<p>Your comment superficially sets up an argument I never made, which is the definition of a strawman.<p>Anyways...<p>I'm all for government sponsored programs that work along side the private industry (and force competition) in order to contribute to the general welfare, which is what the constitution states. For example: defense, infrastructure and education among others.<p>However, I'd love to rid our government of all the pet projects, pork, worthless organizations (and employees) and general waste that rape our income.<p>It's near impossible to fire a government worker, which is a crime in and of itself. Our government is so inefficient that consulting firms are rolling out in mass ""staff augmentation"" programs that take over the responsibilities of a given agency/department.<p>Think about that...you hire government workers to do job X. They are so incompetent at job X you hire high priced consultants to complete job X while not firing any of the workers. The end result? Job X is completed at two - three times the original cost. Ridiculous. If you ever want a first hand look at how inefficient the government is, live in DC for a few years.",1211317035

The poor are ""lucky duckies"" for having such low tax rates (evidence: tax share statistics which take account only of the income tax, ignoring the state, local, and payroll taxes which make up the majority of the burden for the poor).

One explanation that leaps to mind is that the total tax level will remain constant because the government will always tax sufficiently to fund its programs, and those have stayed roughly constant as a proportion of GDP. This leads to a seeming noncorrelation between any segment of the tax code and total tax revenue.<p>Even if the above explanation is far off-base, I hope it shows how a historical noncorrelation doesn't necessarily mean a lack of causal connection.",1211316371

The words aren't particularly important since a person can be extremely rude and/or cruel without ever swearing. So instead he has been taught about about the taboo surrounding swearing as well as the importance of communication.<p>I want him to be a kid and have a good time and feel safe but I also want him to be realistic and prepared. Sometimes it's a balancing act but I never get lazy and tell him untruths.I've considered it but it seems a slippery slope. My son is also very perceptive so when things don't add up, he's quick to point it out.<p>At times I will give him a simple answer but I tell him it is a simple answer and that I can tell him more if he wants it, now or later.  He usually opts for later.  If I don't know something, I suggest that we google it and research it together.<p>I've read that adolescence is somewhat of a new thing (past 100 years or so) and that it is lasting longer and longer because of the way children are coddled by their parents while overwhelmed by options via media. It's my hope that by keeping things real that he will be able to utilize the world around him rather than become another indecisive, selfish, bored 25 year old years away from exiting their adolescence.",1211314492

I'm more concerned about the erosion of true public space (as in a public plaza, square, city streets, etc) and the conflation of such space with purely commercial zones. I know of at least one dense ""new urban"" development (University Villages in Marina, CA) that includes a plaza owned by the developer, which allows them to outright ban people, demonstrations, gatherings, or at the very least make it prohibitively restrictive when trying to plan or hold such events.<p>As a shopping mall, it's great.

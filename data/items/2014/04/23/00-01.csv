7631431,comment,7630299,7630299,4,0,eaurouge,,,"The way this usually works is that the inventor would inform the university&#x27;s technology licensing office of the invention.  The licensing office would sample the industry and decide whether or not to file for a patent.  The bar for filing a patent is often very low.  Interested companies can then approach the licensing office to license the technology.<p>In some cases, one (or more) of the researchers may decide to start a company and license the tech.  Often, the researcher is a student that worked on polishing the original invention; sometimes (rare) a professor takes a sabbatical to build a startup based on the invention.  Many tech companies get started this way, including the likes of Google.  It&#x27;s also one of the ways Stanford gets filthy rich.<p>I&#x27;m surprised USC&#x27;s office of tech licensing were unaware of the original invention and/or that they decided against filing a patent.

In mini-Baccarat, players do not touch the cards, and the cards are reshuffled instead of thrown away.  This type of scheme only works in mini-Baccarat (and Punto Banco - a mini-Baccarat variation), and the casino would only comply with the unusual requests that made this scheme possible for very big players. Casinos are very tolerant of high rollers - Caesars Palace was fined $250,000 a few years ago for allowing a man to jump up on a Baccarat table and dance before placing his bets.<p>In this case, Ivey had an Asian woman with him, and she told the dealer that she was superstitious and asked that the dealer turn cards of certain values a different direction.  That she was Asian was important because the casinos are claiming that Ivey requested that his dealers speak Mandarin Chinese, and that the instructions to turn the cards were given by the woman in Mandarin so that supervisors wouldn&#x27;t hear and immediately object to the request. In any event, the dealers complied.  This incredibly simple strategy apparently worked at Borgata and Crockfords in London, to the tune of over $20 million in combined winnings.  Because the casino could have simply said &quot;no,&quot; I find it extremely unlikely that the Borgata will prevail here.<p>This was much more of a social engineering hack than anything else.  Interestingly, because of this issue, casinos (at least in Las Vegas) have purchased cards with a new type of background that looks like pixelated noise - much harder to do this with.",1398213554

It&#x27;s more subtle than that, so we have to be precise.<p>The invariance theorem shows that given languages L and M, there&#x27;s a constant c such that for any string x, |K_L(x) - K_M(x)| <= c. Intuitively, that constant c is the program size of an M interpreter in L (or vice versa). It&#x27;s easy to see how K_L(x) can&#x27;t be larger than <an M interpreter in L> plus <the shortest M program that outputs x>.<p>What this means is that given sufficiently large and complex strings x, K_L(x) is very close to K_M(x), because c is constant and finite, while you can construct a string x with arbitrarily large K_L(x). This gives us confidence that K_L measures something &quot;real&quot;, even though our measurement is relative to the (arbitrary) definition of L.<p>Of course, for short programs, the constant factors dominate. You won&#x27;t get a shorter Ruby program for your 30 character string by implementing a full Perl interpreter. In this case, the constant difference c is so large relative to |x| that the invariance theorem, while technically correct, is basically pointless.",1398211658

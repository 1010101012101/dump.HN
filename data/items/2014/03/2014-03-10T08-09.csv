7371881,comment,7371468,7371468,3,0,thebenedict,,,"I was in a similar situation recently working with minimally funded organizations. In the end, after spending about two years on it, I wasn&#x27;t able to make it work. The groups&#x27; needs were just different enough that they required consulting engagements but couldn&#x27;t really afford them. I&#x27;ve found it disappointingly hard to serve small businesses and NGOs given that they often do interesting and important work. I hope you can make it happen. Some thoughts:<p>0) There&#x27;s a good chance your main obstacles aren&#x27;t related to server optimization or finding the right mix of features to roll into a product. You probably need to clarify your assumptions and make sure there&#x27;s really a business to be had.<p>1) Consider honestly whether it&#x27;s realistic to serve organizations that can&#x27;t pay $40 a month for software they need.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible or undesirable, but it&#x27;s a critical question to answer for yourself. You need to eat, and choosing to work with these organizations means you&#x27;ll have to have to subsidize your time with other, higher paying work, offer a level of service that won&#x27;t satisfy you or your customers, or both.<p>It&#x27;s possible there&#x27;s a large enough number of customers that you could support a business on < $40/month, but it&#x27;s unlikely for non-profits, especially given your experience with their heterogeneous needs.<p>2) In light of their reluctance to spend, how sure are you that you&#x27;ve identified a critical need for these organizations? This isn&#x27;t necessarily an indictment of your product. In my experience many small NGOs are still figuring out their internal processes, and what&#x27;s important to them and their funders. Codifying nascent processes in software is hard - bordering on impossible - and sales cycles can be untenably long. On the plus side it means they&#x27;re often willing to be flexible and work with you as you figure out what the software should do.<p>3) If you do move forward (and of course you probably will), be creative about funding. Working with non-profit arts organizations gives you a great story to tell. If submission management and evaluation really is critical, can you work with your customers to incorporate a software budget into their funding proposals? Find out who the funders are. What are their priorities? Can you appeal directly to funders and show them how your software can help achieve and monitor their objectives, and communicate their impact more effectively?<p>I&#x27;d love to hear what you end up doing. Feel free to reach out (my username at gmail) if I can help.",1394441612

7371868,comment,7370912,7370912,8,0,chas,,,"Lifting like this is one of the most useful ideas I have taken from Haskell, but I think it&#x27;s hard to see its utility through the C++. At it&#x27;s core, lifting allows functions that don&#x27;t require a computational context to be composed with values and functions that have a computational context. For instance, `unwords . reverse . words` is a function from Strings to Strings and is used like<p><pre><code>    unwords . reverse . words $ &quot;The quick brown fox&quot; => &quot;fox brown quick The&quot;\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>    (unwords . reverse . words) &quot;The quick brown fox&quot; => &quot;fox brown quick The&quot;.\n</code></pre>\nThis is just a pure deterministic function mapping values to values, it has no special context. To compose it with a value with a context like strings may not be present (Maybe String), it can be lifted with fmap (which really would be more informatively named liftF to keep with the Haskell lift function naming scheme).<p><pre><code>    fmap (unwords . reverse . words) (Just &quot;The quick brown fox&quot;) => Just &quot;fox brown quick The&quot;\n    fmap (unwords . reverse . words) Nothing => Nothing\n</code></pre>\nIt now has failure awareness for free, with no effort by the original function author. Haskell has an infix synonym for fmap, <$>, that makes this even more natural:<p><pre><code>    unwords . reverse . words <$> Just &quot;The quick brown fox&quot; => Just &quot;fox brown quick The&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis looks very much like the first example:<p><pre><code>   unwords . reverse . words $ &quot;The quick brown fox&quot; => &quot;fox brown quick The&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis is really powerful because it means any function with no special context can now be used with any context that implements Functor (or Applicative for multi-argument functions). The view that fmap executes functions with no context in a special context also explains why fmap for lists is map. A function returning a list can be looked at as a function non-deterministically returning multiple values. This can be seen when using monadic bind (flatMap/concatMap) with functions returning lists:<p><pre><code>   [1..5] >>= (\\x -> [x-1, x, x+1]) => [0,1,2,1,2,3,2,3,4,3,4,5,4,5,6]\n</code></pre>\nLooking at lists like this, a function with only one return value is deterministic, so if it is given a non-deterministic value, the result should be the result of applying the deterministic function to each possible non-deterministic value with no change in the number of possible non-deterministic values, that is to say that it should be mapped over the list!<p><pre><code>   show  $   1     =>  &quot;1&quot;\n   show <$> [1..5] => [&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;5&quot;]\n   fmap show [1..5] =>[&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;5&quot;]\n</code></pre>\nThe key idea here is that lifting like this provides a way to easily and extensibly compose functions with different expectations about the context in which they will be executing. This idea could be fruitfully applied in many languages outside of Haskell and I&#x27;m excited to see how it interacts with other parts of C++.",1394441181

7371836,comment,7371246,7371246,6,0,MortenK,,,"Some of the differences between trading card games, shareware etc and pay-to-play:<p>1) The older models have transparent pricing, whereas pay-to-play have opaque pricing. You can tell the price of a deck or full version of a shareware game, but you can&#x27;t tell how many IAP&#x27;s you&#x27;ll need over the lifetime of a pay-to-play game.<p>2) When something is &quot;free!&quot; but actually not, it is a bait and switch technique (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait-and-switch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait-and-switch</a>). This leaves many consumers with a feeling of being tricked.<p>3) IAP&#x27;s are often transient replenishables such as gems or gold. A trading card or full version of a game, you own permanently.<p>4) It&#x27;s hard to trust that pay-to-play games isn&#x27;t specifically designed to make you part with dollars. Players come to doubt the fairness of the game rules. Even for &quot;honest&quot; game makers, there will be suspicion of foul play in the game mechanics.<p>5) Pay-to-play games, like slot machines, make their money from 10-20% of users called &quot;whales&quot;, who are susceptible to gambling addiction. Using psychological tricks to extract money from such people is very shaky, ethically.<p>When games promote feelings of suspicion, exploitation and even psychological manipulation in the majority of players (i.e. non-whales), you get this kind of backlash, as in the case of clash of clans and other pay-to-plays.<p>Has it ruined the gaming industry? Not in my opinion - I think (or hope) pay-to-play is a fad which will devolve into a niche. As people become aware of the shady tactics being used, they&#x27;ll tend to avoid them. Or at least gravitate towards those pay-to-plays, where it really is possible to have a decent game play experience without paying.",1394440270

Information like SSN, address, mother&#x27;s maiden name, driver&#x27;s license number, etc. is simultaneously proof of identity and &quot;private&quot;.<p>Credit card numbers and checking accounts have basically the same flaw.  All a merchant needs to pull money out of your account is the account number and some pretty basic additional information.  If you write someone a check for a penny, you&#x27;ve given them enough info to drain the account.<p>What we really need is a complete overhaul of how we prove identity.  Identities should be linked to public-key/private-key pairs so you can prove you are who you say you are by signing a nonce, and thus others won&#x27;t be able to impersonate you just by hacking a third party.  Similarly, monetary transactions should be signed by both the sender and the recipient and include amount, date, memo, etc..

Eventually this project became &quot;The Integrator&quot; (and surprisingly, seems to live on as integrals.com).<p>At first, The Integrator only returned results in mma syntax.  If you entered the expression `Cos[x]`, it would return - literally - `Sin[x]`.  This was neat and all, but once you had a result with exponentiation or division or what not, you&#x27;d want a prettier result.  For example, if you asked for the integral of `Sin[x^2]`, it would spit out `Sqrt[Pi/2]<i>FresnelS[Sqrt[2/Pi]</i>x]`, which, you know, ew.<p>Twenty years ago, of course, there was no MathML - there wasn&#x27;t even a working group.  So in order to provide a prettier result, he returned a GIF with the Math-rendered output.  Because this was back when we were still using client-side imagemaps and some browsers still didn&#x27;t support inline jpegs.  So this quick hack was totally reasonable.<p>Since The Integrator&#x27;s compute backend was actually on his desk, he put a caching layer in front of the Mathematica instance.  It was a trivial one, so if you asked for the integral of Sin[x], it would just look for Sin[x].gif in the cache directory and if that existed, it wouldn&#x27;t send the query of to the Mathematica backend.<p>Unsurprisingly, this led to us kids just stuffing a bunch of crazy GIFs into the cache directory.  Dan started it - if you tried to integrate his initials, it would return a picture of him.  After that, though, we piled on and eventually you could integrate all our names, as well as a bunch of internal jokes.<p>I worked on The Integrator after Dan left, and of course I kept the easter eggs, but at some point it was handed off to another team who tried to create some more general web front-end to Mathematica.  This team sadly lacked both Dan&#x27;s cleverness and his sense of humor, so not only was the software slow and clunky, but it also lacked the easter eggs.<p>I&#x27;m always surprised that Wolfram Alpha - twenty years later - still renders its results and returns a GIF.  You&#x27;d think that we could do a little bit better by now.

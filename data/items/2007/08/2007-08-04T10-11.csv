Hell, the crappy '62 Ford Falcon shares the same characteristic. The first company that puts out a decent looking car today is going to make 50 billion dollars off of it, simply because the market is utterly starved. Hell, put a 4-banger in it--no one really cares about that.<p>Sure, we're irrational. But even if Molly Housewife and Joe Sixpack judge people based on good looks, at least their estimations are roughly accurate. GWB <i>is</i> better looking than John Kerry. Who's the idiot: Molly Housewife or the DNC? The republicans went out and looked for ""Mr. Electable"", while the Democrats looked for...(not the ""best"")...but the guy with tenure and connections and 3 purple hearts. Very reasonable.",1186224907

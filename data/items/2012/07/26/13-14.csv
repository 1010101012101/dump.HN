Since then, lots of features have been added, which of course inflated LOC and increased gems/plugins dependency even further. We migrated the app to Rails 3.1 last year with the help of a number of gems that provide backward compatibility. Even though, it took much longer than what we planned. Majority of the files, be it models, controllers or views, had been touched and changed. The worse part was that we didn't have sufficient test suites to assist so lots of manual tests. Along the way, we gradually replaced those obsolete plugins/gems one by one, which was a pain but seemed to be worth it.<p>Early this year we migrated the app to 1.9.3/3.2.x. Basically the same process but less painful, as most of the gems/plugins issues have been ironed out last year.",1343311104

4295963,comment,4295710,4295710,4,0,frankphilips,,,"The app development business is an extremely tough market to break into right now. There are two ways of approaching it.<p>A) Build a services company.<p>This can be lucrative if you need short-term cash. However be prepared to sell your ass off. Obtaining clients is NOT easy, with the amount of offshore competition.<p>B) Build products<p>Let me tell you right now that if your product sucks, this isn't worth the effort at all. Your app will drown in the sea of other apps. Do your research, focus on big markets, and figure out ways to make successful apps even better. If you put in quality time in building kick-ass products, this is the way to go.<p>Most importantly, try to figure out how to get the social component baked into the app. Take Draw Something for example..in order to play, you NEED to invite friends. This is genius, because it builds a viral component into the app. Oh by the way, give the app away for free and power it with in-app purchases. Only charge for an app if you've built up enough traction with a free app.<p>Overall, mobile app development is a hard business, and the smart move would be to spend as little as possible, and try to break even first, then reinvest.",1343311073

True.. \nMy first thought was well, i could say the reverse, but realized, our current implementation of directories and hierarchies are restrictive. in the sense of having multiple tags/directory names to a set of files(it can be argued, symlinks do the job well enough). The analogy, also brought to mind the choice to allow multiple inheritance or not.  I guess the trade-offs are the same. Power to the user vs easier(but restricted <i>) for the user  \n</i>-- I don't mean the tag system per se, but the idea of having only one level of filesystem.<p>P.S: As far as my personal stance, it comes down to the type of use/nature of application/(perhaps more appropriately) amount of attention being spent. I don't want to have to descend hierarchies of filesystem(Even ones, i created/customized myself) to find my music.

It's the fact that the filesystem is so huge that it's hard to manage and there is no way she keep where everything is in her head. The fact that operating system files, application files, and user created files are mixed rather indiscriminately is probably the biggest problem. Also photo-managing applications trying to make things simple by saving files but not telling her where they put them leads to a lot of confusion. But the idea of files and folders she has not trouble with; it's the difficulty of navigating an impossibly huge and insufficiently mapped directory structure that she has trouble with.<p>The concept of folders is pretty straightforward: ""Everything has its place and there's a place for everything."" People naturally organize things through place and directories create a semblance of 'place' for abstract pieces of data.

4295866,comment,4294959,4294959,7,0,ap22213,,,"I've worked on standards committees off and on for many years, and his experience seems typical of the issues that crop up.  There are many problems with standards groups and the way that they work.<p>One major one is that, often, the participants come from different areas with different perspectives and visions of the outcome.  Since participants rarely go to work with a firm set of agreed upon requirements or use cases, it leaves each member room to craft their own understandings of the goals.  I've seen way too many working groups attempt to create a 'master' spec that takes into account all possibilities.  Or, alternatively, clusters of people form from similar problem domains, and powerful clusters can take the work off course.<p>A second major problem is that there often is a lack of real user participants.  Standards work is as close to the dullest engineering work one can get.  Worse, it seems to attract certain types of engineers that love building specifications. Because of this, usually the real users flee immediately.  This usually leaves a body of over-educated, overly-technical people to argue a lot over sometimes irrelevant details.  Those types of people are definitely necessary for the standard to work in the end.  But, because the real users flee, their influence is usually unchecked.<p>A third reason is that working groups rarely seem to use iterative and incremental life cycles.  There's rarely any working code, often little V&V, and participants and users often can't experiment with their ideas.  As we know, what's good in theory, sometimes doesn't work well in practice.<p>I think there are systematic reasons much standards work fails.  The 'design-by-committee' outcomes arise from 1) lack of firm use cases to bound the work, 2) dissimilarity between participants, 3) lack of real user participants, 4) lack of iterative / incremental cycles.",1343309761

My employer has extraordinarily loose security: our main file server has no access restrictions on any user's working directory. So, I am able to get a quick look at the filing practices of just under 200 people. Of these, 15 didn't use their personal folders at all, presumably preferring to store everything on their desktops. <i>Everyone</i> else had at least one level of folders in their directories. Roughly half of the company are developers, the other half are non-technologists, like sales, administrators, and trainers.<p>I asked my wife (MD of a mid-sized media company with over 500 staff) what her lot did. Every one of the middle managers she directly looks after have complex filing schemes of their own. She recently went through a big process with IT to create a centralised repository for project work so she is intimately familiar with how her team run their workflow. This is not a technology company; these are sales managers, marketers, operations people, creatives and so on.<p>9/10?

4295846,comment,4294719,4294930,6,0,voidmain,,,"FoundationDB co-founder here.<p>As other posters have already guessed, we don't support long-running transactions (we only keep multi-version information for a short time).  So if you keep a transaction open for a long time it will not commit (after a while reads will start to fail, too).<p>It's not architecturally impossible for us to support long-running read snapshots, but it is expensive for our storage servers to keep snapshots alive for a long time.  So our backup solution instead works by backing up transaction logs while doing a non-isolated read of the database.  At restore time we will replay the logs to get back a consistent point-in-time snapshot.<p>The reason that we see higher burst than steady state performance has nothing to do with transactions. We have to do reads from SSD as the application requests them, and we have to make writes durable by logging them right away, but as you surmise we can defer the hard work of doing random writes to our btrees for a while.  Even a workload that is 90% reads benefits a lot from deferring writes because writes have to be 3x replicated and because consumer SSDs are comparatively slow at mixed read/write workloads. Read <i>only</i> workloads will not see any initial burst (and might see a ramp-up time from cold cache effects).",1343309464

Ever since the Zynga acuisition you get the following<p>1) Automatic Facebook login checks. I'm fine with this since everyone I played with are on Facebook. The problem here is that sometimes the automatic login does not work leading me to constantly open, close, open, close, open the app just to get the the main screen.<p>2) The game is buggy as hell. Not only is the login bad, but the game constantly dies. Its not fun anymore. In the back of your mind you know that as soon as you click out of an ad, the application will close out causing you to reopen it to see ... more ads. Its ludicrous.<p>3) Speaking of ads, there's like 3 times the ads as before. Some ads don't even have a way to click out of it. You're just stuck looking at a 10-30 second ad to draw (if the app didn't close) for 10 seconds. It also seems as if every time you touch a screen, you get an advertisement. Its ridiculous.<p>It wasn't like this game was that fun to begin with. But turning a game into a chore just makes you not want to play it anymore. And I haven't.",1343307780

Not only has the $5 billion has been paid out over four years - meaning even a 1% app won't necessarily replace a decent job in a Western European country or the US - but also that much of that 1% has probably gone to apps that are no longer in existence due to changes to the approval process, the developer agreement, the API, or simply the maturing marketplace - i.e. 650k represents the current number of apps in the marketplace not the total number of apps which have offered over the past four years.<p>That's not to say the analysis isn't a useful back of envelope calculation.

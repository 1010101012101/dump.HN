What does happen, however, is mostly repetitive and overlapping work.<p>This is a $2.2 billion operationyouve got to have some people involved in administering it, managing it, running it, leading it, he says. Were about as lean as we can afford to be.<p>As Acting President Timothy Sands stated, they need people to manage things for the entire university. The university itself, however, is comprised of many different schools. Each of these have their own admin to function.<p>Some schools, however, overlap in what they teach and do. Other schools don't have the same demand as they used to. Others have difficulty in being self-sufficient (i.e. difficulty fundraising) and rely entirely on state funding. The same goes for departments within schools, which also tend to have their own admin. For all of these cases, it makes much more sense to consolidate in order to reduce reptition and overlapping work as well as costs. So why hasn't this been done? It does happen, but, as you can probably guess, bureaucracy tends to get in the way. Each school/department formed for a reason, and they don't want to be ""acquired"" in a sense, especially the admin because their jobs will be at risk.<p>I remember being told about a discussion between several deans and an alumni of the university who went on to become a billionaire. They were discussing several things with one of the topics being the budget and the university's future. The alumni suggested a plan to form a new school by consolidating a few of the schools and departments since what they did was overlapping or complimentary. No one agreed to it.",1353984778

I'm sure that much of what management--reasonable management, anyhow---does is valuable, but is it <i>that</i> valuable? I really don't know.<p>For programming, at least, I think it's partly just historical. That's how it's always worked. In a different setting, like a factory, this makes sense as no factory worker is going to have a big positive effect on productivity while a good manager might. But for programming, the ratio of productivity between programmers and managers is much less biased towards the latter.<p>I guess more progressive software development companies actually are changing this, paying programmers relatively more and reducing the amount of management. So perhaps it's just a matter of the industry adapting slowly.<p>I think there are going to be many parallels between professors and programmers, so the two questions probably overlap a fair amount.

It's due to an easier shopping experience, with the DRM getting out of the way. I'm not sure you can even meaningfully call Amazon MP3's approach DRM: it's just watermarking.<p>Pirating content is trivial and easy. In order to compete, you have to make an as-nice experience. Buying a book on the Kindle store is _easier_ than torrenting the book (if only slightly) - DRM has nothing to do with this aspect. DRM doesn't even remotely stop the spread of content.<p>The only time I've heard DRM being remotely effective is really complicated systems on games, delaying a crack by a week or so, which apparently increases sales (at the cost of plenty of bad-will from paying customers) - although I'm not aware of any published studies that really investigate that and compare to the negative sides.

That is simply not reasonable for someone who's experience is limited to doing web coding and dabbling with C for hobby projects.  In that context, just writing the PCI driver code is an almost insurmountable task.<p>If I were advising this fellow I'd suggest that he study and try to implement the simplest of OS's on a small embedded development board.  This cuts through all the crud.  Then, if he survives that, I might suggest that he moves on to Tanenbaum's book and take the time to implement all of that.  Again, in the context of a working web professional, that's easily a year or more of work.<p>After that --with far more knowledge at hand-- I might suggest that he start to now ask the right questions and create a list of modifications for the product that came out of the book.<p>Far, very, very far from the above is the idea of starting with a completely blank slate and rolling a new OS that takes advantage of nearly nothing from prior generations of OS's.

His job is to just go around the country/world selling the school to ""recruit"" (we don't actually need more faculty) in order to boost our ""prestige"" so we can climb up in the almighty US News rankings. He doesn't engage with faculty or students at all.<p>Then below him is another Dean, who is a prick. He makes something like $280,000 and also doesn't do much at all. He is also a ""recruiter."" At least he answers emails when you have a question.<p>Then there are other Deans, like Dean of ""Student Affairs."" She makes $130,000. Mind you this is just for a law school of 1,000 students situated on a larger university campus that will have its own Dean of Student Affairs as well. I have no idea what she does. She does get dressed up every day in fashionable clothes and walk around the building chatting up people. That's all I ever saw her do.<p>Below that is the ""Director of Student Services"" or something like that. This guy works his ass off, has a mediocre basement office, but literally runs the school. What does he earn? $80,000. Anytime anyone had a question, they had to go to him. After exams, he gets a pile of USB keys, one for each exam. Takes each grade for each class and logs it, curves the grades, reports them, etc.<p>It's all a big scam. A big one.

They think it will boost their ""ranking."" Nevermind that ""ranking"" doesn't do anything for the local job market, which is still stagnant, and every year new graduates enter it looking for work to pay their $150,000 in loans (at 8% interest, non-dischargeable).<p>This school isn't even that bad compared to the other law schools out there, namely the private ones.

In fact, they worship these institutions. It's their ""alma mater,"" after all, it's like family, isn't it? Some even DONATE to them! The federal government enables the scam by flooding the industry with easily obtained credit, with no restrictions on tuition charged, and even letting for-profit ""schools"" get the money if they want.<p>This is a racket that is in big need of disruption.

It's very real.<p>When dealing win an array is 400 times slower in a ""modern OO language"" then in raw C, well, the code id fucking bloated.<p>When you can use a simple data structure and some code to solve a problem and, instead, write an object with a pile of properties and methods because, well, that's all you know, that's bloated code.<p>Of course there are lots of places where OO makes absolute sense.  And the fat and slow code is the compromise you might have to make.  That's the way it goes.<p>With regards to my GA example.  No, I had to implement a GA.  That's what was required to even attempt to solve the problem at hand.  Later on we used it to train a NN, which made the ultimate solution faster.  But, the GA was required.  There was no way around it and Objective-C was such a an absolute pig at it that it made it unusable.<p>> Simply picking a new language is laziness<p>See, there's the difference.  I started programming at a very low level and have experienced programming languages and approaches above that, from C, to C++, Forth, Lisp, APL, Python, Java, etc.<p>I have even done extensive hardware design with reconfigurable hardware like PLD, PLA's and FPGA's using Verilog/VHDL.  I have designed my own DDR memory controllers as well as raw-mode driver controllers and written all of the driver software for the required embedded system.  My last design was a combination embedded DSP and FPGA that processed high resolution image data in real time at a rate of approximately SIX BILLION bytes per second.<p>So, yes, I am an idiot and make really fucking dumb suggestions.<p>Because of that I would like to think that, if the choice exists --and very often it does not-- I do my best to pick the best tool for the job.<p>More often than not, when it's pedal-to-the-metal time C is the most sensible choice.  It used to be that you had to get down to assembler to really optimize things, but these days you can get a way with a lot if C is used smartly.",1353982492

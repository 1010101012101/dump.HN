The details surrounding which kernel was used in Mac OS X and how much NeXT was responsible for really does not bring much value to me as a reader. Like I said, if I cared deeply about this, it's well documented already and easy to get from other sources.<p>What I got out of the book was a remarkably intimate look at the man himself: What made him tick, what his philosophies were, what the politics were and what the major obstacles were that he had to overcome. All of this, wrapped in an enthralling narrative and surprisingly intimate detail.<p>Isaacson may not have understood the technology, but he definitely understood Jobs' humanity, or sometimes lack thereof.",1329285192

Rhapsody with the NeXT Mach kernel, a pulled-in, non-NeXT BSD application layer, and then various other Mac layers (GUI, Cocoa, etc). Technically there is nothing wrong with his statement.<p>Actually, technically there's everything wrong with that statement. It's just not the case.<p>Cocoa <i>is</i> NeXTStep. Take a look at the APIs. Everything is prefixed with NS.<p>The old Carbon APIs were completely reimplemented--those original Mac OS Classic APIs were mostly written in 68000 assembly with a liberal amount of Pascal thrown in--totally unsuitable for the new flagship OS.<p>I used OpenStep for about a year before the first OS X Betas were released. I can tell you first hand that Rhapsody was 90% NeXT and 10% veneer to make it ""look like a Mac"". ""Terminal.app"" barely changed from OpenStep to Mac OS X. Several other apps looked identical too. I'm pretty sure the minify button iconified the icons the way OpenStep used to.<p>Don't forget that NeXTStep/OpenStep had a full BSD subsystem too. That's not new or unique to Mac OS X. Go to your terminal and ""man open"". Notice the ""First appeared in NextStep"" part.<p>The fact is Mac OS X 10.0 <i>is</i> NeXTStep/OpenStep with some extra compatibility layers for the carbon APIs (plus an VM for doing running OS 9 apps).

Particularly in the early days of the App Store when they needed to attract developers, it made better headlines to have one dev making $10M than to have 100 making $100K. It was the illusion of a gold rush that helped grow the App Store so quickly. At this point attracting developers isn't much of a concern, but there's still little incentive to make app discovery easier. Apple only needs enough quality apps to populate their lists. The other 99.9% serve to pad the number of iOS apps for marketing purposes so that Apple can club Android over the head. For users it doesn't matter much that there are 500,000 iOS apps because there remains no really good way to find most of them. But that big number sure sounds good in commercials.",1329284411

3593177,comment,3592688,3592993,5,0,SeanLuke,,,"> The modest quantity of ported or migrated Mac technology (e.g. the Carbon APIs) existed purely to form a compatibility layer with existing Mac apps, and don't form the basis of any future development path.<p>I dunno.  Post-Rhapsody, Apple worked hard to unify Carbon and Cocoa to provide a consistent user experience across applications.  IIRC, in a surprising number of cases, the way unification was achieved was to make the Cocoa element be little more than a compatibility layer on top of Carbon.  For example, I believe the save and open panels, print and page layout panels, and various dialog APIs worked this way.<p>It seems to me that if Carbon was viewed as a dead-end from the get-go, embedding it in many cases <i>under</i> Cocoa was a funny way of demonstrating that.<p>Carbon was a big project, and wasn't modest by any standard.  Again IIRC, Apple rewrote the entire Finder in Carbon (and not in Cocoa) in order to test the Carbon library for bugs.  Other things came from the Mac while their NeXTSTEP equivalents were abandoned: for example, UFS was blown away and replaced with HFS+.  Quicktime was ported, as were 3D facilities and game APIs.  NeXT's Soundkit was deprecated in favor of stuff for OS 9.  Java, up through 1.3.x at any rate, came from OS 9.  I think the font facility, always an ugliness in NeXTSTEP, was replaced with Apple's (including support for OpenType etc.).  I think your depiction of this stuff as ""modest"" is not particularly accurate.<p>So anyway, Isaacson's depiction of OS X as being basically Mac technologies with a little NeXTSTEP kernel is ridiculous.  But don't make the same mistake in the other direction.",1329284375

Can you name any of these people who have witnessed none of the NeXT OS making it into OS X?  Surely, there must be hundreds of Apple engineers who would have witnessed this.  Surely there would be lots of corroboration.    In fact, it should be obvious to any competent engineer who looks at the technical documentation about OS X or iOS.<p>The reality is, it is obvious to any engineer who looks at this technical documentation. The OS is completely NeXTSTEP, in fact, the classes still contain the prefix ""NS"" which is short for ""NeXTSTEP"".  Its ""NSScrollView"" not ""APScrollView"" or ""MCScrollView"", etc.<p>If you review the technical literature, you'll find that OS X is more accurately described as NeXTSTEP with a Mac UI on top of it, than ""Mac OS with a NeXT kernel"" as Bill Gates describes it.<p>But maybe I'm completely delusional.  I've only been working with this software for 20 years.  Please, show us some of these eyewitnesses to the fact that the NeXT operating system wasn't used.<p>""What you are basically doing is libeling (since it is in written and not spoken word) Isaacson by accusing him without proof that he misreported events in his book.""<p>Well, the truth is a positive defense in Libel, isn't it?  The fact of the matter, as any competent engineer can confirm for you, is that OS X is essentially NeXTSTEP, evolved of course over the years, with a Mac Like UI on top.  It got the menu at the top from the Mac, but it carried over the Dock from the NeXT days.  The kernel, the Frameworks, the operating system, everything essential was NeXTSTEP.  And most of the ""Mac"" things really were a new UI-- an evolution of the Mac UI called Aqua.<p>I don't know how many more examples to give you, but its clear that for you to believe that I'm ""without proof that he misreported events in his book"", you're going to have to give something more than assertion.  I've cited many areas of the operating system that are direct descendants from NeXTSTEP and NOT from Mac OS.  You've given none.<p>""Please keep in mind that Steve Jobs specifically sought out Walter Isaacson to do the biography because he believed that he would tell the story completely and honestly, which is what Steve wanted.""<p>Yes, and I want you to please keep in mind that this was not the first time that a hack reporter that Steve trusted betrayed him because he wanted to sell more units of his writing.   I don't know if Isaacson was the most honest biographer-- in some areas he was quite correct, accurate and fair, though this mostly seems to be because Andy Hertzfeld did the heavy lifting.<p>In Steve Jobs earlier years he was more immature, and more problematic and probably a lot less likeable.  Notice also that you've not heard a peep from me (or Gruber) about an unfair portrayal in that time period.<p>The fact of the matter is that these kinds of lies-- like the claim that NeXTSTEP wasn't used, or that Apple stole from Xerox -- are repeated as articles of faith by people who wish to attack Apple.  Yet they are very trivially refuted.  And when refuted, the response is to pretend like the refuters are just unhappy that someone said something bad about Steve.<p>Well, lots of bad things were said about Steve that are true. We're not objecting to those. We're objecting to the lies.<p>Hell, if Steve engineered the purchase of NeXT by Apple even when NeXTSTEP wasn't useful at all, and thus had to be scrapped when building OSX (as Gates essentially alleges) that would be an example of Steve Jobs being one hell of a powerful salesman.  I wouldn't even see that as something to be embarrassed about.  Why would I object to that?<p>No, the objection is to the fact that its a lie fabricate from whole cloth, and trivially disproven.

I managed 1000 downloads in a week, he managed 10,000 in far less than that. His Google +1s also went to 381 almost immediately. His current # of Google +1s more than two months later: 389.",1329282347

I never owned a 4, but my 4S works fine.<p>Yes, it has two antennas and it also, unlike the iPhone 4, is both a CDMA and a GSM phone. Hence it needs multiple antennas for the different networks.<p>The antenna is still on the outside.  You can still attenuate the signal by holding the phone with just the right death grip, as you could the iPhone 4, and every other phone on the market.<p>There was no problem to fix.  This is a perfect example of how people spread lies -- with the help of media who wants to latch onto anything that might show controversy about Apple- to create these false impressions.<p>Reality: Every phone, if held in the right way, with have signal attenuation.  This is basic physics.<p>Reality Distortion: There's a problem with the iPhone 4!  It was fixed in the 4S!<p>What I can't understand is the persistence in constantly repeating these falsehoods, even after the truth comes out.  I state the truth (the same design in the 4s) and then someone spouts the claim that it was ""fixed"" because the design did improve.<p>Well, every iPhone is going to improve on the last.  That doesn't validate a false claim that the previous version was defective because it lacked future improvements!",1329282280

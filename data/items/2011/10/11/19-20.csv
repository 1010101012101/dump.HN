3100048,comment,3099392,3100005,2,0,md224,,,"Certainly... if I wanted to create an app where a user could play a virtual ""instrument"" via the computer keyboard, I would want to trigger a specific audio sample (e.g. a piano note or a drum hit) when the user presses a key. There are already several libraries out there (SoundManager2 comes to mind) that allow for fairly simple cross-browser audio output, but the problem is procuring the audio samples themselves. I could go to the trouble of scouring the internet for solid sound samples, uploading all of them to my server, and setting up all of the note/sample mappings... however, much like Google has made it unnecessary for every web developer to upload all the custom fonts they want to their server, I'd like an API that allows me to browse and include instrument sample packs without having to first track down the samples, upload them, and manually map everything.<p>The goal is  to make client-side samplers as painless as possible, lowering the barrier to real-time music generation on the web... kind of like a modern alternative to simple MIDI instruments.<p>I could see this being useful not only for virtual web instruments, but also for any website that wants to utilize some form of dynamic musical feedback.<p>EDIT:<p>I could see this being implemented in a lightweight or a heavy-duty fashion:<p>1) Lightweight: API merely provides note-mapped URLs to the audio samples, up to the developer to decide how to pull in each sample and store/output it.<p>2) Heavy-duty: API takes care of storage and output. Creates an instrument object with a play method that takes a note value (MIDI value?) as input. This is more in line with what ecaroth suggested.",1318362957

3100008,comment,3097105,3097424,1,0,azakai,,,"> CoffeeScript is meant to be synaptic sugar on top of JS. Dart is a language with different semantics that happens to compile to JS. As such it includes a lot of runtime code. More appropriate examples would be Emscripten, Parenscript, or ClojureScript.<p>I think you are correct here. But there is still something very worrying about what Dart compiles into. It isn't just the <i></i>amount<i></i> of code, which is what most people are discussing. It's the content too.<p>The content of the code makes it look like much of that code will be run all the time. In other words, it isn't just some library functions that are called rarely, it is stuff that will end up being called from your inner loops. I might be wrong here, but that's what the code suggests to me.<p>In that respect, the Dart compiler looks different from both CoffeeScript and Emscripten. CoffeeScript by design compiles into straightforward JS, and Emscripten manages to compile into mostly-straightforward JS as well, which is why it has decent performance. But what Dart compiles into looks like it would not run very fast on most JS engines. It <i></i>might<i></i> run fast on Chrome, if they tune its inlining and other capabilities for Dart-like code, but I doubt that would hold anywhere else.<p>Again, though, I have not profiled the generated code, I just took a look at it, so I might be wrong.",1318362233

Well, fine, but then this article is a banal exercise in circular logic: Of <i>course</i> the iPad is the leader of the iPad market. Unenlightening.<p>Let's hypothesize. Perhaps it would be more interesting to try breaking up the market by end-user goals. What is the iPad's share of the portable music player market? The portable video player market? The <i>non</i>-portable video player market? The web-surfing market? The digital sketchpad market? The digital mixing-console market? The e-reader market? The communications device (SMS, Twitter, voice) market? The GPS navigation market? The casual gaming market? The hardcore gaming market?<p>Is this the way customers decide what to buy? Is this the way designers approach the problem of making gadgets better? If so, maybe this is a better categorization scheme. If not, we could try something else.<p>Perhaps it would be more fruitful to ignore the ""tablet"" nature of the iPad completely. Everyone is focused on the Pad part, but perhaps a real key of the iPad's success is the design of the ecosystem: Minimal variations in hardware to improve reliability, and to make it easier to shop for and easier to support. A brand-new software ecosystem with no need for back-compatibility. A sole-source software installation system that provides leverage for excluding malware and offers generally-seamless automatic upgrades. Categorize systems in this fashion, and suddenly the iPad belongs in a category with the iPhone, a gaming console, the Kindle, and the TiVo, among other things.<p>Obviously, you can slice the universe into categories in more than one way. You can even slice it in several ways during the same essay.<p>But the touchstone of a categorization scheme is: Does it lead somewhere? Does it help you discover something interesting or actionable?",1318361145

3099910,comment,3092558,3094880,5,0,JimBlandy,,,"At a technical level, virtual machines are not the panacea many folks seem to think.<p>Certainly, VM byte code languages are often simpler than silicon processors' machine languages; perhaps they offer safety guarantees; and perhaps they provide garbage collection. These are all big wins for language implementers targeting such VMs.<p>But what no virtual machine will ever do is make modules written in different source languages work together transparently. Any time one module calls another module written in a different language, at least one side of that boundary needs to be written with a detailed understanding of <i>both</i> languages' semantics.<p>Tiny details of the semantics influence the idioms people settle on in that language --- and interfaces are designed around those idioms. For example, JavaScript conditionals treat the empty array and the empty object as true, while Python conditionals treat them as false. Each of these facts shapes what people expect of a ""natural"" API in that language --- and that ensures that modules written in other languages will always ""speak with an accent"", or seem unnatural, at best.<p>You can define a common data world, as the .NET CLR does, and extend each source language to cover that world, but the effect is to change each participant language into a gloss on the common data world. This is why CoffeeScript fits seamlessly into the JavaScript world: JavaScript's and CoffeeScript's data worlds are exactly the same. CoffeeScript cannot deviate from JavaScript's types and objects.<p>Each programming language is like a city occupying an island: commerce within the city is much less expensive than commerce between islands. Although it's sometimes worth it, dealing with ""foreigners"" is confusing and risky. No VM will change that.",1318360563

Most people have no idea what ""success"" really looks like for a blog. They assume that, if six months have gone by and they're not getting 100,000+ followers, they've failed. Another unrealistic expectation is what I'd call an overly generous self-assessment: the blogger in question overestimates how much gas he has in the tank on a particular topic. He may get a few great ideas in his head one day, then build a blog around them, then find himself struggling for material on the third day.<p>2) Lack of Patience. Building a successful following is rarely an overnight journey. Some blogs take years to find their footing, and years more to find their audiences.<p>3) Insufficient or Non-Strategic Marketing. As folks in the startup world are well aware, you really need to think outside the box -- and occasionally go totally wild -- to get attention in today's crowded marketplace of ideas. You've also got to be clever about building credibility, connections to the right influencers, and paths outward from those influencers to broader audiences. By contrast, most hobby-bloggers take a ""write it and they will come"" approach -- hoping naively that people will flock to their blogs as if called to them by magic. Or they'll blast notices out to all their friends and family, rather than taking a careful inventory of who might actually be interested, who might be <i>very</i> interested, and who might be so interested that she'll tell her friends (or, conversely, who might not give a flying you-know-what). It's counterintuitive to think that starting out by telling fewer people is preferable to shotgunning everyone you know. But the shotgun approach seldom works. Start surgically.<p>As it turns out, probably 90% of the work of building a successful blog takes place <i>outside</i> of the blog. Writing great content is the easy part (and it's not easy!); getting folks to notice is the hard part.",1318360529

Premium is a factor of the risk analysis, not a transaction fee.<p>This works very well for concepts like auto or home insurance: most people will - in a given year - never actually crash their cars or destroy their homes. The premium they pay is based on the risk profile of one of these things happening to them, and overall to the pool.<p>Health insurance is a little different, but the concepts remain the same. The only real difference between a nationally run program and several private programs - assuming a level of administrative competency - is the size of the pool. The larger the pool, the less the risk, the cheaper the average premium.<p>You can call it dirty words and all, but if you are against the concept of national insurance programs as a principle, you should really evaluate your view of insurance in general, since you're ""subsidizing"" people who crash their cars, have house fires, pick the wrong banks etc, etc.<p>As an aside: I'm in Canada. As such you might find it interesting that while I believe the US system isn't using the full potential of the available pool, I believe our system has forgotten a lot of the concepts that sustain the insurance industry by just declaring medical care a ""right"" despite the costs.

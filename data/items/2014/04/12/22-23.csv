I try to restrict my charitable donations to things I can deduct.<p>The other reason I don&#x27;t is that I&#x27;m not convinced it would be used effectively. They shouldn&#x27;t be using small donations as their primary source of funding, they should be going after huge corporate supporters.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to donate $100 if it were tax-deductible and if OpenSSL committed to making the minimal effort of reaching out to major tech companies for substantive funding.",1397343457

That&#x27;s Big Brotherish too -- including in the literal sense that snitching is a common practice in the book of that name.<p>Don&#x27;t know about modern US, but there are societies with moral codes against snitching of any kind, including snitching the bad guys to the police. And even in the US, I&#x27;m aware that there at least used to be some old popular attitude against such a thing.<p>In fact, this notion that snitching is immoral in itself, even if it is to the &quot;authorities&quot;, has been part of popular culture and lore for ages, from Zorro and Robin Hood to Batman.

And not only that doing it individually since it is unlikely that a law would be passed for this.<p>For example if I am the only restaurant in a certain area and I charge $35 for lobster &quot;tip included&quot; what I am saying is that less people will buy lobster than if it is priced (at an equal place) where the lobster is priced at $29 because $29 is a more attractive price &quot;on the menu&quot;.<p>I think from my exposure in the business world it is pretty much well established that people respond more favorably to a low price than a high-er price as they aren&#x27;t not able in their head to either compute the total price or somehow a higher price is just a turnoff or other psychological reasons.<p>If you study advertising you will see this. Not that there aren&#x27;t places that have done well by not breaking out charges (all inclusive resorts for one thing or cruise ships as another). But speaking of cruise ships they now offer other restaurants where you pay more for the food and for that matter they charge for drinks.

7579500,comment,7578651,7578846,1,0,vacri,,,"The way it works in Australia (I think, certainly not 100% sure) is through tax credits. The miller buys wheat from a farmer, and pays tax because it&#x27;s a sale. But the miller gets tax credits for later selling that wheat to a baker (in the form of flour). The baker pays tax on the flour, but puts tax on the bread. At each stage value is added to the object, and due to the credits, the differential of that value has the appropriate tax.<p>So if you have a wholesale/retail business, you have an easier time of it - everything gets taxed at the same level, and your clients that onsell can claim their own tax credits. It is the final purchaser of the product that ends up actually forking out for the tax.",1397343014

7579487,comment,7578651,7578808,2,0,vacri,,,"It does make a tangible difference in the cash economy though. When the price tag includes tax, the prices are generally set to easy multiples of the currency. Fewer coins to cart around and manage (and no give/take a penny trays). I found it amusing in the US when I went to McDonalds and ordered three things from the &#x27;dollar menu&#x27;... and was charged $3.24. I also found it odd that a few Americans, despite living in this system their whole lives, had trouble in predicting their costs at the register.<p>Here in Australia there&#x27;s a 10% sales tax, included in the original price. For anything above a few dollars, most prices are whole dollar amounts, and the vendor sets aside 1/11th of the price for the sales tax. What you actually pay is easy to manage and predict, though you get a receipt specifying the tax with odd numbers (due to the 11ths). Go into a supermarket and buy a carton of Foo for $2.69? It&#x27;s $2.69 at the register.<p>My gut tells me that this is why Americans are so much more vocal about tax - sales tax is a stone in their shoe. It&#x27;s addition at the register makes things unpredictable (not to mention any sale that crosses a border somewhere). Here it&#x27;s streamlined away, and there&#x27;s no cognitive weight borne by the consumer at all.",1397342590

But as it stands now, projects like zlib dont even bother GPG sign releases, so how much confidence can you have in the rest of their security posture?  This is failure by way of academic happy-clappy laziness waiting to happen.

Running a restaurant is hard, and there&#x27;s a thousand ways to screw it up.<p>Here&#x27;s my anecdote: I ate in a tipping restaurant in Texas. The steak was late, lukewarm, and so small it slid across the empty plate. The only thing accompanying the steak was a pot of mashed potatoes about four times the size of a thimble. After being largely ignored, the waitress at the end of the meal made a ton of excuses while looking at the wall so as to get me to still tip, and zero effort was made to make me feel better about the situation. If we&#x27;re making sweeping proclamations from single experiences, then this must mean that tipping restaurants make for very much worse experiences.<p>I don&#x27;t like tipping culture for all the usual reasons, plus a couple more. I don&#x27;t like the waitstaff&#x27;s arms being constantly in my dinner conversation, as they refill water or keep checking how I&#x27;m doing. I don&#x27;t like that in almost every other job you can have a crappy day but still come out of it with the same wage - tipping faults people for being human. Imagine if software devs had a variable rate largely based on how they were feeling that day? I mean, code and design when you&#x27;re distracted or angry isn&#x27;t as good as when you&#x27;re focused and content, so it stands up to the same reasoning.

The fact is that there is a limited amount of spectrum available so the only way to get an order of magnitude more throughput (which is what is needed to call something 5G, that is no marketing hype). So the only way to do that is to move the cell towers closer to the user to increase the SINR. That is very difficult and expensive. So be wary of 5G claims, 4G-LTE already comes close to the Shannon limit now, to get more throughput requires a ton more cell towers, probably an uneconomical amount.",1397340610

This enables lots of optimizations that don&#x27;t work when you look at one module at a time.<p>Functions can be inlined across module boundaries, even when they&#x27;re not declared inline.  You can turn virtual functions into regular functions, if you know that the virtual function is never overridden, or if you can derive the exact type.  You can change calling conventions for functions.  You can do better escape and aliasing analysis.  If a function is only called once, then you can probably optimize it a lot better because you know exactly how it will be called.<p>As with all optimizations, not all programs will see any significant benefit.  Programs with heavy inner loops like physics simulators and graphics processors will not see much benefit, since the local optimizer works well enough.  Programs like compilers, interpreters, and web browsers will see larger benefits.  However, the benefits can be high—30% improvements in running time are not unheard of.<p>In short, LTO is a high-cost, high-benefit optimization.",1397340404

This depends on the ability to bypass the privileged servers a microkernel typically uses.<p>Microkernels are nice for security, for a few percent overhead, and that&#x27;s good, but that&#x27;s about all they do, so they&#x27;re not seen as worthwhile for many uses.

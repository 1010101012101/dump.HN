Its default setup with Mako, SqlAlchemy, Routes is quite good and I would say a Ruby-on-Rails for Pythoners.<p>And like RoR, you can fire up “paster shell” to get a nice console. But my best part - how you can set “import pdb;pdb.set_trace()” to start a debug session in a console.<p>I can wrap my fingers around pylons very nicely - and I like the fact that I can “hack” it if I ever wanted to.",1241668660
597379,comment,597297,597337,0,0,Batsu,,,"It's a shame we'll probably never come across intelligent life, unless some incredible developments are made in traveling space.<p>The Drake Equation ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation</a> ) estimates between 1 and 10 intelligent life forms in our galaxy. The unmanned probe Voyager 1 is the furthest Earth born object that we have radio contact with (probably without, as well) and was launched in late 1977. It has traveled less than 2 thousandths of a light year. The nearest star (other than the sun) is over 4 light years away, and our galaxy is something crazy like 100,000 light years across. The nearest similar galaxy is the Andromeda galaxy which is 25,000,000 light years away.<p>In other news, I just recently finished an astronomy course.",1241668616

(how's that for a paradox).  Sure, these animals aren't in the wild, they're just living miserable lives in enclosed spaces, but hey, it's biodiversity and we made it, so we should embrace it, right?<p>Taking that logic to the extreme, isn't <i>Spore</i> the most biodiverse place that ever existed on Earth?  Sure, the creatures are actually virtual and don't exist in a physical sense, but we created them, so shouldn't we embrace that as our future?<p>I admit to not fully grasping the author's point... but I have the feeling that I strongly disagree with it, whatever it is.",1241668572

I like having one editor that can follow me everywhere. Maybe Eclipse or the others work better for java or more out of the box or some such thing, but to me there's a huge benefit to having my programming editing behaviors consistent in a terminal, my desktop, PHP, perl, C, C++, java, etc. (with mode/language specific enhancements of course).<p>If I grew up on Eclipse I'd probably feel the same way I suppose about it.",1241668339
597374,comment,596822,597296,0,0,lacker,,,"Fair enough. Hard for me to argue since I held pretty much exactly your view when I was 22 and smoking.<p>Nothing really suddenly changed for me. At some point it just seemed like it wasn't as good any more. I figured I would quit for a bit to see how that was, got surprised how hard it was to quit even for a day, and then got scared at how addicted I was and got serious about quitting. It took a couple years of struggling after that and now I wish someone had kicked some sense into me earlier, but I don't know how they could have done that. So I am kind of frustrated in this discussion because I feel like the right thing to do is to really try to convince people to quit smoking, but I don't know how to do that.",1241668285
597373,comment,595501,596969,0,0,visitor4rmindia,,,"I will try to explain.<p>Firstly it is a focus on ""results"" rather than output. The novice has produced a lot of output but no results. How would you evaluate if the components serve their purpose? Are they doing too much? Are they not doing enough? It is only by virtue of the program's results that you can check. As programmers we tend to evaluate the code (which is an <i>internal</i> focus) more than the running program (which is an <i>external</i> focus). This is a great way to learn but a bad way to deliver anything of value to an end customer.<p>As a programmer, the novice would understand and be interested in the ins-and-outs of his screen editor, gui routines, and AI module. However, he would probably not have the same level of understanding of finance. For a good product, the novice should concentrate on raising his understanding of finance to the level where he can deliver solutions to his users. By ignoring his users (delegating them to an <i>afterthought</i>), he is making a fundamental mistake.<p>Finally, it is a question of <i>value</i>. This is key - the most fundamental aspect of this scenario. The programmer, for all his effort, has delivered nothing of value to his users. Worse, he does not even have the attitude and direction required to deliver value. When someone says ""I'll put in that stuff later"" (or it's equivalent), you can be sure they will deliver something of poor quality to the users.<p>In the end, if you cannot say the work you have done today will make someone's life better - what is the point of working so hard?",1241668189

597370,comment,597209,597209,0,0,patio11,,,"This feels particular topical to me this week.  We just had a 5 day weekend in Japan and I spent most of it programming.  It was easily my most productive ""workweek"" ever, and I probably wasted <i>half</i> of it.<p>Yesterday was pretty representative: started working at 10:00, madly hacking away at client/server integration.  Worked four solid hours and finally broke for lunch at 2:00, figuring that I would just tweak the integration when I got back and then start working on the web side.  Tweaking the integration required installing Delayed::Job, which required learning how to use Git.  Several hours later I was knee deep in Linux permissions errors and cursing loudly -- the wheels were spinning but no progress was being made, and I hadn't even coded the first screen for the web.  I ended up doing at 7:30 what I should have done at 2:00 -- called it a good day's work.<p>(Sidenote: version 3.0, coming to a blog near you soon enough.)",1241667919
597369,comment,596837,597132,0,0,triplefox,,,"I discussed this yesterday (elsewhere) with respect to games. I couch it in terms of ""permission economy"" (the present strong IP situation) versus ""remix economy"" (the weak IP situation)<p>My analysis is that, first of all, there is a lot of waste overhead involved in large-budget productions. In a remix economy everyone will use the minimum budget possible to produce new material, so producers will operate near perfect-competitor efficiency.<p>Second, and perhaps more importantly, because all material can be reused, consumers will profit; new material will constantly seek to create new value, rather than to simply create a rebranded version of old value.<p>This can apply to drugs as well as media. Presently, pharma corporations each jealously guard their research. Hence they are all duplicating effort. In a remix economy, the company that kept secrets would be overtaken by collaborating competitors, because their costs would be too high. They'd get throttled from the overhead needed both to do original research and keep it secret.",1241667876

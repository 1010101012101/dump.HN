5477866,comment,5476302,5477360,3,0,roundingerror,,,"I've had a fair bit of experience (though not every day for months on end).  From what I've read many people have a similar time, though some may end up with better results.<p>If you're tired, you can use it as an alertness aid.  If before, you would have fallen asleep at your desk from exhaustion, you will instead be able to continue to work (but still be fairly tired).  Modafinil will allow you to continue on from the point of exhaustion and be able to function in some reduced capacity (50-60%).  You will experience some periods of higher function (almost like waking up and being a bit tired, and then your mind clears a bit), basically you will alternate between tired and fine for a few hours, each period about an hour in duration.  Taking modafinil in this manner isnt especially recommended, but if you just spent all day / night putting out fires and you need to come in the next day to ensure everything is still running smoothly (but hard work isnt expected), modafinil will do great here.  Alternatively, I would recommend using it at the beginning of a normal day after a full nights rest.  This will result in some periods of clear headedness, and generally make it incredibly easy to focus on a task.  I wouldnt say Im as quick on modafinil, but I can certainly refactor code and slowly improve it for hours without feeling bored or getting distracted.  I find that it makes me super calm as well.  It definitely hampers creativity / big picture thinking, I wouldnt do system design on modafinil, or even design for a subcomponent, I wouldnt be at my best and might miss details or produce a subpar design.  Basically, if you are just implementing a chunk of code, and have already figured out the details, modafinil will result in a good experience, youll make steady progress, your work will be of high quality, and the day will go by fairly quickly.<p>aaron695 mentioned dose  2-3 pills a week is fine.  Alternating entire weeks on and off is fine.  I would only take at most one pill a day, but some people take two and are fine.  Tolerance builds up about as quickly as it does for Adderall IR.  Definitely dont go drinking on the drug, but if you typically have a drink with dinner youll be fine - just dont expect to feel any of the effects from the alcohol.  Ive felt the beginnings of depression on other nootropics (specifically piracetam - I generally have a poor diet though, so that may have been my fault)  but havent had a problem with modafinil after an extended period of time.  It will be difficult to sleep if you take it too late in the day, definitely dose in the morning.<p>Essentially its a stronger, better version of caffeine (increased alertness, focus, can be used to increase performance with acute use, but with regular use tolerance builds and productivity decreases).",1364881287

Essentially, the Great Depression, in their view, was caused by the fall of the money supply. Friedman and Schwartz write: ""From the cyclical peak in August 1929 to a cyclical trough in March 1933, the stock of money fell by over a third."" The result was what Friedman calls the ""Great Contraction""  a period of falling income, prices, and employment caused by the choking effects of a restricted money supply. Friedman and Schwartz argue that people wanted to hold more money than the Federal Reserve was supplying. As a result people hoarded money by consuming less. This caused a contraction in employment and production since prices were not flexible enough to immediately fall.""<p>Here's a video of Milton Friedman (he won a Nobel Prize for this work) explaining how monetary contraction caused the great depression:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7pnjzCuSv8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7pnjzCuSv8</a><p>""By 1933, the quantity of money in the United States had gone down by a third."" ... ""For every 3 dollars of currency and deposits that people had had in 1929, only 2 dollars were left.""<p>One thing people often forget about deflation is that a general decline in the level of prices <i>also</i> includes labour prices and interest rates. It is characterised by zero interest rates, falling prices, falling wages, and because wages are 'sticky-down', high unemployment. You really do not want to live in a deflationary economy unless you have a large pile of cash. It's miserable.<p>A second, and in my view, more valid definition of deflation is a contraction of the money supply. Ben Bernanke (current Fed Chairman) is an expert on causes of the great depression, and has been doing everything he can to ensure that the US money supply does not shrink.",1364881258

You could also look at this from a Karma perspective.<p>You could also question this in very different ways.<p>I've tried to study this problem in many ways. To an extent I can tell you karma works in very mysterious ways, its slow and there are simply too many factors which are often unknown to us to make a judgement on why a person does or doesn't deserve X in life.<p>Let me explain with an example. Somebody you know didn't study well in college, he is also not known to be very brilliant either. You are a super genius and you get into Google, he attempts every job interview and fails. But finally makes it to a start up as a very low level employee doing some menial job. You both go on to live life as usual. You assume his career his over. Now something strange happens, in the start up the guy is pushed, is put under tough demanding deadlines. Now the guy who wasn't good with books and exams suddenly discovers despite all that. He has something in himself to 'get things done'. The start up becomes a hit, he climbs the ladder pretty quickly ends up making a lot of money.<p>You might ponder how this idiot got so successful, though he wasn't good with books and exams. How come he made it that big without knowing even 10% of what you know?<p>Karma/meritocracy works in its own ways. You don't know how hard the other guy is working, you don't what is valuable to the world or why it is valuable, you don't know how much taking a risk pays off when done properly, you don't know many million things about the other guy to come to any logical conclusion. There are simply too many unknowns to ask 'If it is fair'?<p>The world is actually fair, in its own way. You simply don't have enough data to decide if the world was fair to somebody or not. Or many times you are jealous or biased or whatever.<p>Ultimately karma works. It actually does.",1364879741

If the CEO is 100x more productive than the average person working for her, then she is, in fact, more productive than 100 of the people working under her put together.  That's exactly what that statement means.<p>And, anyway, whether or not the CEO is 100x more productive, her output is worth 100x more.  How do we know?

Wal-Mart may or may not be lowering the quality of products nationwide, but what they're demonstrably doing is providing goods to people at great prices that let them generate a lot of profit.  That's something people want, whether or not you agree with them.

And put following content.<p>With the same token that you say HN is not a CraigsList, when an HN-responder puts an effort in going through their product and writing a personal note inquiring about a possible opportunity at their company, posters should have the courtesy to respond to the responder acknowledging that in-spite of their good/bad profile they can't hire him/her.<p>I know these two advices are from me to you and you to me. All the remaining folks who have been one-liners will continue to be so.<p>Btw, I am a graduating student from IIT Delhi, who have applied to many startups that interested me with a personal-note and list of projects I have done with clickable-links. While about 10% of posters responded saying that they did like my profile but can't take it further because of visa, remaining 90% never responded.<p>While I am not the best engineer, when my detailed & clear personal application doesn't get an acknowledgement reply, I can imagine why responders are just sending one-liners. If posters want to hire, they will hire from one-liners. No point of detailed-personal application.<p>On a side note, my profile with links to projects is <a href=""https://gist.github.com/sravfeyn/13534c67812183235a2c/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/sravfeyn/13534c67812183235a2c/</a> I am hunting for an engineering position at a start-up with product-innovation.",1364879269

Actually I think the term ""co-founder"" it's a little bit too much; I'm looking for someone to work with me on this project and see where it goes.<p>I've started this working in my free time, and realized that it takes more than one person working on it to get it going (apart from programming, there are other aspects as well  - like design, marketing, attracting investment, etc). Everything it's still in early stages, however, basic functionality is implemented.<p>There's no deadline and we work in spare time. The only requirements that I am looking for in a candidate are:<p>- passionate about creating a solid note taking cross platform application, and have desire to succeed in turning this into a real product. It sounds simple, but it's not...<p>- have programming knowledge in Python, Django framework, feel comfortable working with jQuery & plugins, CSS styling, Tweeter Bootstrap, and other stuff like this that comes around main app.<p>- familiarity with storage systems, networking protocols, DNS, web servers, databases, and *nix in general (preferable)<p>- easy to work with, open to new approaches in web technologies, and willing to work/learn together with me on this. I am not looking for the ""best programmer"" out there - reasonable knowledge will be fine.<p>In the end, like any start-up, the app can be successful, or not. There is no guarantee. The good part is that the only investment is time spent on building the app and a laptop :)<p>If interested shoot me a line (gabriel at intranets-talk dot com) - and let me know. 
Thanks,
Gab.",1364879125

And although OP did the opposite, I would encourage many technical minded people to consider law as an option - much of the reason that laws suck for technology is because the people who work with the law on a daily basis do not understand the technology, and it would be great if we had more general tech literacy in the legal profession.",1364878820

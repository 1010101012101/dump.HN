I'm particularly excited about v0.9x as the current SSL performance is still a massive issue when it comes to actually running apps in production (it's SUPER SLOW).

Node's interface with OpenSSL is somewhat naive and leaves a lot of potential optimization on the table.</i>",1340679559

I know how unwelcome my views are but that doesn't stop me usually, although I don't speak up nearly as much as I did for a while. And it's not just conservative views. Basically if your views don't match with the majority of urban, liberal, Apple-evangelizing, Silicon Valley, entrepreneur/MBA/developer elites, then you will be put in your place. It's too bad really, because so many here that don't share those opinions stay quiet. It is quite a bubble.<p>But back to the site at hand, I think it is a neat idea, but I don't have time to text with people I don't know about politics, because I work, have a family, and am old enough not to waste much time on politics.

My irritation isn't with PadMapper, it's that many of HN have latched onto PadMapper as some kind of cause, many resorting to complaining about CL not allowing people to use their data, even though the terms of service are crystal clear on the issue. There are plenty of companies out there that could benefit from piggybacking off of others' data. I have little sympathy for a company that builds their product around using someone else's data and then loses access to that data, when they should have had their partnership deal with that company in place before just going ahead with it.<p>Building a great UI is trivial. Anyone on this site could build something useful in a weekend. The hard part is actually building a business around it. Sales, marketing, business development. Code is the easy part. Ebay, Godaddy, and countless other sites have terrible UI design, but they have marketing and sales efforts that build their businesses. Plenty of beautiful sites and companies have washed away because they didn't know how to sell their product. CL certainly isn't making the money they are by giving their data away to anyone that just decides to start using it.<p>In my own business, in the telemedicine/mental health space, it would make my life so much easier if I could scrape the Psychology Today therapist listings and just use their data with my better (in my opinion) UI. But I certainly didn't build my business depending on that data and then complain that they won't let me steal their marketing, advertising and sales efforts for my own benefit. Instead, we have to do the hard work of selling our product ourselves.<p>I certainly didn't come crying on Hacker News because site X won't let me make money off of repackaging their content.<p>It all comes down to the terms of service. If it's against the terms of service, why the hell would anyone build a business around violating those terms, knowing full well that  it would get a Cease and Desist.<p>Building a better Craigslist is an awesome goal -- but you don't do it by stealing craigslist data. You get your own damned data. Building a business is hard work -- it isn't just about building some nifty aggregator.<p>I would gladly use PadMapper and a related service Unpakt. Those are pain points for me that certainly need curing. But I'm not going to feel some sort of moral outrage that Craigslist is protecting their business.<p>Compete. Don't whine.",1340679341

(The ""whether"" part.) But many people will misremember or distort the exact words that were exchanged. (The ""what"" part.) And those exact words are what count, legally.<p>Likewise, a person would have to be <i>really</i> slimy to claim that your signed, written contract is a forgery. Most people won't dispute that they signed it. (Again, the ""whether"" part.) And since it's in writing, and there simply is no room for disputing the ""what.""<p>To put it another way, getting a written agreement raises the moral and legal stakes for a potential welcher. They'd have to accuse you of forgery, instead of just shrugging and saying ""I guess we remember the conversation differently.""",1340679285

Yes. Yes, they are.<p>There is no probation period when you start a business and become a legal officer of a company. If you want to be a CEO, you'd better act like it from 9am on day 1, because chances are you have the power to commit your business to any obligation it can legally undertake. Once you do, your business will be on the hook for any such commitments you make, forever. And depending on where you are, you might get away with failing to honour a commitment if you made an honest mistake and the business failed, but if you were just blatantly negligent about your responsibility to run the company properly then your corporate legal shield might not be as solid as you'd like either, leaving you on the hook personally as well.",1340679248

Totally different experiences.<p>With Microsoft (for their Vancouver office, 2007) - the interviews were pretty technical, but not severely challenging. I was unhappy with my job at the time, had prepared very well over a period of months for coding-type problems, and was ""in shape"". The toughest question they asked was, 1) how to serialize a binary tree, 2) how would you compress the representation given that the tree was not full. They were immediately impressed when I asked then whether they intended me to write the deserialization code as well - the thought had apparently never struck the other interviewees. They asked me to code it up, and I did.<p>With Google (Bangalore, 2011) - I was way out of shape for this, having not programmed in a while. The phone interview required me to write two programs, one of which was to check whether a sudoku puzzle configuration was in the solved state, and the other to generate all subsets of a given set that had a particular cardinality. I managed to code the programs relatively easily. I was selected for the onsite interview, where they asked me mainly  questions on dynamic programming. There was also a question on counting frequencies of letters in a massive corpus of text, and on how I'd implement a certain feature displayed in the search results that Google returns. The outcome: they didn't say outright that I failed the  interview, but that there has been some change on their side, blah blah and  would I be willing to wait for some more time? Obviously I had not done well enough to clear the bar.<p>Overall I got the impression that Google's version was more centered on competitive programming-type problems than Microsoft's, which was more software engineering-centric. MS definitely much easier than Google.",1340677009

One said they sent the coupon, the other said that they hadn't due to software issues.

The main difference between the confusion that existed ten years ago and the confusion that exists now is that now a variety of inadequate ontological theories have been embodied in a plethora of correspondingly inadequate programming languages. For example, much of the complexity of object-oriented programming languages -- and the subtle and confusing differences among contemporary object-oriented languages -- centers on the treatment of generic operations on interrelated types. Our own discussion of computational objects in chapter 3 avoids these issues entirely. Readers familiar with object-oriented programming will notice that we have much to say in chapter 3 about local state, but we do not even mention ``classes'' or ``inheritance.'' In fact, we suspect that these problems cannot be adequately addressed in terms of computer-language design alone, without also drawing on work in knowledge representation and automated reasoning.""<p>The next time your complex type hierarchy starts to fragment, you might want to think about that.",1340676174

They suck down gasoline - the RX8 gets maybe 15mpg if you drive it hard. 20 if you are careful. And it has to be premium. You have to be careful not to flood the engine - never run it for less than 30 seconds, or without revving to at least 3K RPM.<p>The upside is that the engine itself is <i>tiny</i> and mounted almost exactly in the middle of the car - under your feet. Rotary's get about 3x power for the same displacement as a reciprocating piston engine. They're great in airplanes.<p>I've spent a lot of time in an RX8 and it's a blast to drive if you're willing to deal with the cost and finicky nature of the beast.

For the vast majority of people with kids, the ""safe"" option is getting a good job that pays well and offers good benefits.<p>It's also a bit disingenuous to say that if your web business fails, you lose nothing.  Perhaps that's true for a single guy who is starting a company with some friends, but for the average married founder w/kids, there is a significant investment that will need to made in the form of time spent on their startup, as well as mental and psychological energy.

Which means, you must open the Object or Symbol classes to implement them. Nothing wrong with that in your code, but when you do so in a framework like merb (or Rails!), everyone using your framework gets your little patches in their namespace as well.<p>My feeling is that with the way Ruby's global class namespace works today, opening a core class has much more serious consequences when you are writing a framework, gem, or plug-in then when you are writing code that does not have ""downstream clients.""",1219937813

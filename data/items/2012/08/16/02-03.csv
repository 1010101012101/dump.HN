But yes I was thinking that the password still has to go through UIs (Web & Native), be sent over the network and read by the server and only than can it be hashed and compared to the stored hash.<p>I agree it sounds weird especially since I guess everything is done on top of .NET and JS. Neither of which is likely to suffer from buffer overflows nor would whatever protocols they use have problems transporting large strings with non-ASCII chars. And I don't any other technical problems that might cause.<p>But there has to be a reason. I guess it's possible someone was overzealous or screwed up. Maybe it was because it would be too hard to type it on an Xbox?

4389687,comment,4388339,4389601,1,0,philwelch,,,"Maybe ""justify"" is too strong a word. The central principle is that having sex with someone who does not consent is rape. It doesn't matter if their clothes are on or if you're in bed with them. It doesn't matter if they consented to protected sex, but you chose to have unprotected sex with them instead even though they didn't consent to it. It's still rape.<p>To say that it isn't technically rape could mean a few things. It could mean that it's worse than rape or at least equivalent to rape, or it could mean that it's not as bad as rape. But if it's just as bad as rape or even worse, there would be no point to the remark at all, especially in a series of comments meant to defend Assange. Obviously, the intention was to say that this action is something less than rape.<p>To say that this particular type of rape is something less than rape might not justify it, but it does minimize it in such a way that denies the basic agency, dignity, and human rights of the victim. It's a hideous, misogynistic notion. (That's not a supporting argument, by the way, it's a conclusion.)",1345085384

4389663,comment,4388339,4388852,4,0,vidarh,,,"For starters, the women did not make these accusations. A prosecutor have.<p>This distinction is worth making. At no point did these women go to the police and claim that Assange had raped them - not even the Swedish prosecution has made the claim they did. They did go to the police and ask questions that someone at the police then decided to interpret as indicating that a crime might have taken place, and start an investigation.<p>They then were interviewed, in situations that subsequent reports indicate may have been blatant violations of police procedure - no recording was apparently made, one of the police officers involved was allegedly a friend of one of the witnesses.<p>The results were statements that have not been formally released, nor been verified or scrutinized by anyone independent.<p>What is allegedly the police reports were on the other hand illegally leaked to a Swedish newspaper, and Assanges name was confirmed by authorities in conjunction with the case in blatant violation of Swedish police procedures. But we don't even know if the leaked police reports are accurate or final copies.<p>Subsequent to the investigation, the first prosecutor to get involved in the case looked at the police reports and decided they indicated that no crime had taken part.<p>What is allegedly descriptions supported by the contents of these statements was then used in the arrest warrants formulated by a second prosecutor that stepped in in a highly unusual move and reopened the investigation.<p>The reasons for why she stepped in to reopen just this case, despite how unusual it is to do so when another prosecutor has closed the case, has not at any point been explained.<p>In retrospect, it is now also being alleged that one of the women is refusing to sign statements about the case at all.<p>In other words, so far we don't even know what the women actually said to the police.<p>What we know is the content of a highly unusual and highly illegal leak to a Swedish newspaper, and how one prosecutor has chosen to interpret their words in an arrest warrant written with the express purpose of ensuring that a UK court would extradite Assange to the UK.<p>We do know one prosecutor found the police investigation had not found any evidence that any crime had taken place at all, and another found it did. We do know there are a lot of open questions about how the statements were collected, and about lack of documentation. We do have reason to question whether at least one of the women is willing to put her name behind the police interpretation of what she said. We don't know whether they made any actual allegations that amount to any crimes.<p>Maybe it is all accurate, and perhaps he is guilty. But it isn't even remotely clear whether or not there even should be a case to answer.<p>> They may not be true, but the truthfulness of the allegations is outside the scope of an extradition.<p>That is true, and it is not surprising that UK courts ordered the extradition.<p>But the real issue here is also not whether there is a genuine reason for a UK court to approve an extradition, but whether or not there is something going on that gives reason to be concerned that these accusations are not the full story.<p>Especially in a case where the Swedish prosecution have had a year or so to interview him in London, yet have chosen not to while claiming they can't. At the same time, somehow Swedish police has been able to go off to Poland to interview two suspected Polish murderers about a double homicide.<p>So either Swedish police has just risked messing up a double homicide case, or the Swedish prosecutor in the Assange case is at best misinformed about something she ought to know about, at worst being intentionally deceptive.<p>Even if we don't buy the US extradition idea, this is still a strange situation. The argument that they somehow need him on Swedish soil is nonsense - Swedish police provably regularly conduct interviews outside of Sweden, and you can provably be charged and tried in absentia in Sweden, despite many claims to the contrary.<p>So why does the Swedish prosecutor resist taking up evidence in a rape case for a year while making claims about why she is not that can not be supported by fact?",1345084700

Or is it the backend for the public side only?<p>Let me give you an example.  I have a customer that uses MySQL for some processing on their web site and all data gets batched up nightly and entered into the PostgreSQL-based accounting system.  The MySQL db is accessed <i>only</i> by the app which does the processing and the connectors to the PostgreSQL db.  The PostgreSQL db has a lot more logic in it and is a lot more complex.<p>In their case, their environment is <i>not</i> subject to any of the MySQL gotchas.  They can make sure the credit card processing software runs in an acceptable SQL mode, and if something goes wrong between the PostgreSQL export of reports and the MySQL public side (which has happened for reasons other than MySQL's fault), they can track down and fix the problem.  That's what loosely coupled systems are about.<p>IT in this case is about risk management. How can you guarantee that specific important data will not be lost.  You can do this with MySQL for some set of environments (either because the data truncation isn't a big deal, regarding your tweets, or because it can be retrieved from another source, or because there is <i>only one app accessing the database</i> so you don't have to worry about apps turning off strict mode), but you can do it with PostgreSQL for a much larger set of environments and that's what the complaint is.",1345084112

Nobody could possibly deny this.<p>and<p>> not beyond the realms of possibility, is that these women are genuinely making these accusations.<p>Those statements seem to support that, wouldn't you say?<p>However, when presented with the question of why didn't they  just come in and questioned him after being invited and granted access you reply with<p>> Sweden is well within their rights to refuse that offer.<p>So they are just dragging their feet refusing the offer. Is it because they don't like British food or is the travel too grueling. Remember, they are spending all this effort and time  supposedly because they deeply care about the fate of these two women.<p>The next step in the process is the questioning and then after being invited to question him to move the process along they refuse.<p>You'll have to forgive everyone if they don't quite believe the official reasons. To me it sounds fishy for example.<p>> Assange in the embassy and decided they wanted to charge him he would just walk out happily?<p>It doesn't matter what happens then. They identified a next step in the process and they claim they cannot accomplish it. While it has been clear that they can.",1345083073

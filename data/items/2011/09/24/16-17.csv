Followed by more than a decade in industry.  And I still learn everyday too.<p><i>The notion that someone could self-teach what I know seems impossible.</i><p>I should be clear, as the term is ambiguous, they'd likely learn from experts, but not by going to a board approved medical school.  But through things like online schools, programs, books, etc...  It wouldn't be someone trying to recreate a curriculum from scratch.<p><i>There are licensing and board requirements, but conspiracy theories aside they are not designed to create artificial scarcity, they're supposed to keep dangerously ignorant doctors from practicing.</i><p>Given the lack of policing after becoming a doctor I'm skeptical of this claim.  At the college level I'd like to see a wider swath let in to medical school, and then a more rigorous approach to filterning, based on not only medical proficiency, but ethics.

I am not on the platform team, but I have built apps before in the wild-west days.<p>The app requires explicit permission from the user in order to post activities automatically. The idea, if you watched Mark's presentation, is called ""frictionless sharing."" A lot of people don't share because it's another step, but if they could install an app like the Washington Post Reader (a great app--even Mark has it installed), they are happy with sharing articles they've read with their friends.<p>I understand you might be concerned, for example if you added that app without realizing that it will post content. If you are concerned about the privacy implications, you can always change individual permissions for an app by going to your account settings, then selecting the 'app' tab on the left, or by going to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications</a>. If you are concerned about spamming your friends' news feeds, that's why we built ticker, for the light-weight activities like ""watched a movie"" or ""listened to a song"" or ""read an article"".<p>If I remember correctly, the exact wording of the app permission request was alarming enough to get my full attention (""I, the application, can post as you"" or something like that), so I'm worried less about a user missing that part. In my known experiences, the app was installed with the knowledge that it will share your experiences--because the idea is you want to share your activities with your friends. As soon as I read an article, my first action is to either send the link to specific people who are interested, or post it on my wall if I think everyone is interested.<p>We operate under the assumption that users will not do what they don't want to do, as long as we make it explicit what might happen. And if they make a mistake, they can always go change their settings. So I'm not so worried about users who sign up for the Washington Post Reader app, which is marketed as a social reading experiment, and subsequently complain that it shares your read articles.<p>You might still be concerned, in which case, please let me know why (users being misinformed?), and I'll try to pass it onto the platform folks, who were really heads-down the past few months.",1316882857

I have read studies that suggest that in certain markets and certain practice specialties we are and will face shortages of physicians in part because medical schools are training too few physicians.  When I ask academic physicians they seem to think admitting more students would erode the quality of students.  In other words, scarcity is a public good in this case as it helps to ensure that the ""most talented"" will ultimately become practitioners.

I want to clear up a few things that you guys are talking about.<p>For starters, it's true that a visit to a news story or watching a video will trigger a feed story. The point that most people seem to be missing is that this requires you to knowingly allow a social application. For example, in my case, I installed the social plugin for rdio (rdio.com). When I listen to a song on rdio, it publishes it to my friends ticker feeds. (Ticker is the bar on the side where likes, listens, reads, etc go). There are a couple websites that are doing read social browsing, for example the Washington Post's social reader (<a href=""https://apps.facebook.com/wpsocialreader/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://apps.facebook.com/wpsocialreader/</a>). Again, just by visiting this page you will not trigger anything unless you have already allowed the application access.<p>In the past I've setup my music player on the laptop to publish the songs I'd been listening to, to my IM client (as away messages) - Adium let's me do this out of the box. It's kind of the same idea, instead this is just built in to the website you visit or music you listen to.<p>You can also disable any application you previously installed by going to Privacy Settings and clicking on Apps and Websites. It should all be there. You don't have to log out of facebook or close your account. Just delete all your social apps.

There's probably some parallel universe where programming requires certification and only a handful of schools have it.  It requires doing MITs SICP as the intro course.  Requires compiler construction courses, algorithms, theory of computation and complexity, etc... And then a 4 year apprenticeship with other programmers.  And then you can start building webpages, if that's what you want to do.<p>But we live in a world where it is open and so there's instruction available at many different levels.  Would you let someone without a PhD in CS build your website?  Of course you would.<p><i>And then separately, how many people would trust a self-taught diagnostician?</i><p>I trust my car mechanics diagnosis despite the fact I have no idea what level of education he has.

I don't plan to go back anytime soon.<p>The first day I got there, chock full of excitement to see the city and get a feel for the place (really, people were laughing at my extreme enthusiasm about going to visit Detroit), I biked downtown for the jazz festival and was nearly mugged, or worse, on the way back around midnight (a bunch of guys in a van kept trying to get me to stop and approach the van, to help them get gas...there were gas stations within three blocks in either direction, and the guys in the van were young and looked perfectly capable of walking a couple of blocks to get gas...and the van seemed to be running fine and the guys were giving off seriously nefarious vibes, whispering to each other, etc.). I've biked through the tenderloin in SF in the middle of the night, walked through  Brooklyn and the Bronx at 1 AM, and spent time in numerous so-called sketchy places; I travel full-time, so I've been to some interesting places, and I don't travel like a tourist. I try to see the real side of the places I go. I've rarely felt threatened in the nearly two years I've been travelling. I felt threatened in Detroit, on more than one occasion.<p>Detroit has a reputation for being a scary place because it <i>is</i> a scary place. And, while I enjoyed some aspect of my visit, like finding a walk-up outdoor movie theater setup among old abandoned buildings, and seeing little farms in urban areas (though they seemed to be in a somewhat bedraggled state; they seemed more like a media ploy that has played out rather than an actual sustainable community effort in some of the cases I saw), and the music scene is good, it doesn't make up for the sadness of the place itself.<p>Also note that those $6000 houses (and even less) will have property tax of several thousand per year. Detroit is still valuing houses at the rates of 10+ years ago, and the tax rate has climbed drastically in the past several years to try to keep revenue up to the level required to keep schools running, roads in decent condition, and police on the streets. Despite all the increases, the city is still experiencing significant budgetary problems. I looked into buying a house there, as it's cheap enough to be damned near an impulse purchase, but the cost of buying, restoring, securing (because you're going to need bars and cameras if you have a decent house within the city of Detroit), and paying the taxes on it will make it much more costly. Still incredibly cheap, but nowhere near $6000. And, you'll be living in Detroit. Not worth it.<p>Oh, and starting a <i>tech</i> company there? Madness. Notice that only one of those companies is actually worth more than a few hundred thousand (and it's not a startup, anymore, and hasn't been in a couple of decades), or maybe a couple of million, at best. That's not a coincidence. Those would be also-rans in the valley. I've noticed the same thing about most ""look at us, we can be a startup hub, too!"" articles. They mention a half dozen websites no one has ever heard of, as proof positive that the city can compete with actual startup hubs for tech companies.<p>It's cool that Detroit is improving. I'm sure some people will make solid money on real estate in the coming years in  Detroit. And, I'm sure with an investor making a number of investments in Detroit-based companies, they'll eventually churn out a few decent-sized businesses, and they may improve the city further. But, it's not where you go if you want to start a tech company and you want it to succeed.",1316881700

A commission would be if the same thing happened and the restaurant forwarded x% of the sale to groupon.<p>Here's an example. You are a programmer and I send you a customer. The customer gives you $5000 worth of work. You pay me $500. So you collect the money and pay me a commission. Other way: I get the $5000 from the customer (I have the contract with them) and pay you $4500 for what you have done (and have added risk etc.)<p>In the case of the first example I don't book $5000 in sales. In the case of the second example I do book $5000 in sales.

Like if I book more sales then there might be some local gross receipts tax whereby I have to pay % of sales etc (or something like that). Of course if I am applying to a bank for a loan maybe I want the higher sales because they will be more impressed.

Unfortunately, this includes the CTO, who wants to force every developer to practice TDD. (along with other 'agile' methods)<p>When I've worked on something in the early stages of design with someone who has used TDD (for example, if someone junior asks for help designing their project), I end up having to throw out or rewrite major parts of the tests, and explain to them why that test is useless. Usually the problem is one of two things: the functionality changed because their design changed (maybe a subclass where there wasn't before, or the data structure goes from an array with constants to a hash/map) or the test was actually useless and was testing that a library worked.<p>Are there places where you'd want to do TDD? I'm sure there are, though I don't use it. Do I think less of programmers who use TDD? No. Do I think less of programmers who try to convince me to use TDD? It depends how. If they say ""it produces better code"" or some such bull, then yes: Simply writing tests first does not help me produce better code, nor have I seen it help other people in my company produce better code. If they don't know what they're doing, or aren't familiar with something, writing tests first just means they're writing broken tests, and increases the overhead for fixing it (""I can't change that, the test will break!"")<p>Personally I prefer to write code and then write tests for the parts of it which I think are critical. I also prefer to write tests that ensure the code itself is solid, not ""does it return what I expect when I expect it to"". By that I mean write tests that feed the method bad data, nulls, edge cases, etc. The way I've seen TDD described/practiced is that tests are written to say ""this is how I expect this method to perform under normal circumstances""<p>As you said, it does seem like TDD tries to be DBC. However, it also seems like the people selling TDD sell it as the One True Way, not as another form of DBC with all the benefits/drawbacks of DBC.",1316881008

3033514,story,,,1,0,thomasmonopoly,"More unedited criticism on the #takewallstreet protest - Thomas Monopoly",,"http://www.thomasmonopoly.com/<p>I went down to the #takewallstreet protest last Monday. I suppose its hard to say that I support a group that is so fractious and contradictory in their aims, but Im pretty sure that once they are able to assemble a list of goals and objectives I will more than likely be in agreement with most of that list.<p>I took the J train to Fulton and headed down Nassau to Wall Street. I worked on Fulton St. for three years and passed the NYSE everyday on my way to lunch, so I was surprised to see the corner of Broad and Wall Street more orderly than ever. There wasnt so much as a scrap of paper blowing in the wind. Fences and barriers were in place as well, forcing people to walk single file down William St. and back, then circle around. The police were not allowing anyone to tread on so much as an inch of Wall Street.<p>looks like the NYPD should be the ones hash-tagging #ourwallstreet<p>So I walked all the way down to Beaver St. and over to Broadway and I headed up to Zuccotti Park, the home base of the protest. Along the way I noticed that just about every road leading to Wall Street had been blocked off. Zuccotti Park is about 4 or 5 blocks from Wall Street. I had found the protesters recent change in tone, from #takewallstreet to #ourwallstreet, to be rather bold seeing as they were encircled by mobile police lookout towers, vans, and officers on foot ringing around the perimeter, about 5 blocks from Wall Street. But its just semantics I suppose. Although what I found was less an occupation than it was an internment camp cordoned off by the police.<p>The confusion of the protest grounds went beyond semantics though. The park was littered with trash and remnants of food, cardboard pizza boxes, empty bottles, and makeshift compost piles. There were mattresses and people sprawled out or curled up in sleeping bags in the middle of the afternoon. Some people were getting high, others listening to music or arguing with each other. I didnt feel like I was at a protest as much as I felt I was in a playpen and the police were babysitting. To be clear, some of the media have been describing the people living in the park as bums and insulting them as people who dont take showers. I wouldnt have any problem with that if it were true. A lot of people like to complain about protestors and activists as hippies who dont take showers. For all I care the entire protest could be made up of smelly homeless people and it would still be just as credible as if it were fully employed men and women in suits. Some of the best people Ive met in life have been people who live on the street and I wish I were comfortable enough feeling greasy to go days at a time without showering. I mention this because I take issue with the groups tactics, not the members of the group themselves.<p>although most of them were rude and handing out stupid flyers like this one<p>I walked into the center of the park and sat down at the groups tactical command unit. With everyone huddles around three desks in the center of the park, I counted at least 12 computers, two large HD monitors, and multiple people on tablets and smartphones, a setup to rival that of the police. For a bunch of anti-consumerists it was pretty ironic to see them all working on Apple computers and devices though. Apple is probably one of the most overpriced, overhyped fascist corporations there is, not to mention a darling of the stock market, currently trading above $400 a share. (And thats coming from someone who uses their products.) Glancing around at the various computer screens I saw that most people were on Twitter, though some were on Spotify, browsing through pictures on Facebook, one was editing on Premiere Pro and some others were taking self-portraits. I was wondering what so many people were doing on computers, especially at five in the afternoon, a time that seemed to be ripe for protesting Wall Street. But before I could ask what all the computers were needed for three police officers walked up and told the kids eating pizza that they were going to confiscate the groups gasoline tank because they werent allowed to have gasoline in the park without a permit.<p>you can see the girl in the background start to say something but she literally chokes on her mouth full of pizza...<p>Naturally it created a scene and everyone started shouting legal! legal! as a call for any nearby lawyers that might be able to help. The police took the gasoline tanks without much trouble. I was pretty surprised that for a group that had been planning this protest for the past few months, the only times theyve made the news thus far had been in reports that someone had failed to obtain the proper permits for an action. The police captain returned a few minutes later and tried to explain that they could call a number to get the permits and retrieve their gas tank, but he kept being interrupted by a girl with red hair and pigtails screaming Is anyone tweeting this?! Whats our hashtag?! Is anyone tweeting this?! The police are taking our gasoline! How are we supposed to run a generator without gasoline?!<p>The officer handed someone a card and said I cant answer your questions, youll have to call my supervisor for information on the permit, and he left.<p>I wanted to talk to someone about why the group wasnt marching or protesting, but were instead sitting in the park holding a rally about the quality of the food, which lasted for about 15 minutes. I asked the guy sitting next to me if there was anyone that could answer some questions for me in a representative capacity. He said he could. He didnt seem to have the attention span necessary for following a line of questioning but I went ahead anyway.<p>Whats your name?\nDagger.\nHmm. Ok Dagger. Well, for one thing I was wondering why so many computers are needed. Everyone seems to just be fucking around.\nTheyre on Twitter. Are you on twitter?\nYes.\nWhats your name?\nThomas Monopoly. So why isnt anyone marching on Wall Street?\nWe cant.\nWhy not?\nWhats our hashtag! he called out.\nWe have takewallstreet, someone from behind me yelled, ourwallstreet, occupywallstreet, and occupiersneeds!<p>I let the conversation end there. I tried to eavesdrop on the conversations between some of the people at the computers but all I could make out were two people trying to find a comedian online to come out and perform in the park.<p>In front of me a city employee was emptying out the park trash bins. No less than three people, one at a time, approached him and put their hand on him and said, in a very sincere voice, I really appreciate what youre doing. I really appreciate you as a person. Thank you.<p>So I sat there for a few more minutes looking around. Just when I was about to get up a conversation caught my ear. One guy was saying that hed had enough, and that he was sick of the way the protest was being conducted and he was leaving. He was upset, saying that he had tried to help and no one was doing anything that needed to be done. Another guy chimed in, saying, What we need is a comedian down here. Or someone to get up and play some guitar, chill everyone out. Everyones all wound up.<p>A few feet away the crowd was cheering a man with a megaphone who said, We may not have toilets but we have computers!<p>I walked over to the man who was saying he was going to leave. His name was Walter.<p>He was a tough looking Irish guy with a baby face. The guy next to him was Al, a 60 year old Italian guy who sort of looked like Jimmy Durante if Jimmy Durante had been a badass. Walter was angry and explaining to a kid with long stringy hair and bellbottoms that he was through helping out with the protest and the kid was trying to convince him to stay.<p>Ive told them what they need to do, Walter was saying to him. They dont listen. This isnt a protest. This is a pizza party for these kids. The cops are going to keep coming back if they keep doing things they shouldnt be doing. I tried to help. They dont want to listen. Im done. Im going home.<p>Walter was rattling off a list of technicalities that needed to be addressed that were being ignored, And those kids are just sitting there. Talking about how bad the peanut butter is. Theyre not even protesting. As he was saying this a meeting actually was being held to discuss the vegan options for pizza.<p>The kid in the bellbottoms was trying to calm Walter down and explained to him that they need him and that people will listen.<p>I talked to Walter after he was through ranting. He was participating in protest of Congress bailing out the big banks while at the same time writing the Zadroga Bill to withhold payments for cancer treatments and other illnesses. He was a World Trade Center first responder and was receiving treatment. I couldnt understand exactly what his qualifications were, but he was a fire watchman and engineer of some sort and knew a lot about permits and certifications. Most of the people who passed by knew him by name so I assumed he had been working fairly closely with the group to help them conduct their protest in a legal manner and advise them on their permits and compliance issues. He was an old school union guy. The kind of person who gets things done and doesnt like to spend a lot of time talking about them.<p>Walter told me that he had been in the park since Friday to participate in the protest. But that he was through. Three strikes and youre out. I try to give everyone three chances and they've blown every chance I've given them.<p>He said that for the past few days it had been one problem after another with the people living in the park. And why arent they marching! Look at them. Theyre just sitting there! They just sit there all day!<p>He said maybe 25% of the crowd marches each day and that its always the same group of people. I warned them about the candles, you cant have open fire in the park, they didnt listen. I warned them about the garbage. Health inspectors are going to kick them out. Every night Ive gone around picking up their trash. I said look, theres trash everywhere, there are rats and cockroaches and there are empty trash cans right there. People need to be putting their trash in the trash bins. But they didnt listen. They all claim they want to save the environment but they cant even take care of their local environment. Theres still shit everywhere. Im done. Im not picking up after them anymore.<p>[The next day Joanna Michele sent out a message on Twitter from the park complaining that:\nhealth inspector may be utilized to try to shut down the square. #ourwallstreet \nas well as others who claimed the health dept. was conspiring against them.]<p>I told them that they need permits for the generator, Walter continued, and for the gasoline. They didnt listen. And now they want to complain about it. This is just a bunch of kids sticking forks in a socket. Theyll learn for themselves. He pulls out an American flag bandana and cleans his sunglasses. A girl stands up in front of the crowd assembled on the ground behind us and screams I havent shaved my legs for three days! and the crowd cheers. Walter Shakes his head. You know who these kids are, these arent people who have ever worked for anything. Theyre kids who dont want to work. Theyve never had a job. Thats different than having a job and losing it. I want to work. These kids dont want anything.<p>I suggested that may in fact be part of their philosophy, and that maybe they were opposed to the entire economic system, but I dont think he heard me. The same people everyday are the ones marching while the rest sit here and eat pizza. If youre going to protest Wall Street protest Wall Street. Theyre going to get arrested for permit violations and for hanging signs where theyve been told not to hang them. Why not get arrested for protesting instead then? Why not get arrested for marching or for actually being on Wall Street? A couple kids get arrested for being on Wall Street, I told them they have to be uniform. Theyre blocking the street marching five deep. You have to march like this, he slaps me on the shoulder, up against one another. They want to sit around and complain and hold meetings and scream about the peanut butter sucks thats fine but Im going home. Im going home and Im going to break every sex law in the books with my girlfriend. Ive been out here for three days. You know how Im going to beat Wall Street, Im not going to think about it.<p>Just then a kid walks up and says Whats going on Walter?<p>Im going home. This is pointless.<p>The kid says I know what you mean. I totally just had an FBI agent try to entrap me. I was just standing there and she came up and tried to get me to say that I support violent protesting. But I didnt say it. She was obviously an FBI agent.<p>Walter looks at me. I came out here to protest. This is a joke.<p>We were standing over an entrance door down to the parks sprinkler system and two fire safety guys from the city asked us to move so that they could get below the street and turn off the sprinklers. They opened the trapdoor and climbed down. Walter pulled out his own flashlight and aimed it down through the passageway to give them some extra light. He stared down into the passage.<p>I miss that stuff, he said. I miss rolling around in the dirt down there and working on that stuff. The guys climbed back up and closed the trapdoor. Walter said goodbye and headed home.<p>I could understand the way Walter felt about the protest. I had been monitoring it through the weekend via Twitter and the Livestream video channel prior to showing up in person on Monday. The protestors seemed juvenile to me. If they had advertised their protest as a sit-in at Zucotti Park I may not have been so irritated. But the fact that they had been making it look and sound like they were actively marching on Wall Street each day, when Wall Street was locked down and most of the protestors dared not even try to march on the NYSE, was a little pathetic in my opinion. They have been sending out messages online such as:<p>We don't need another Kent State #NYPD<p>Which in my opinion is incredibly insulting to the victims at Kent State, since the Zuccotti Park protest has been the most peaceful protest Ive ever read about or seen, and the cops and city have been fairly accommodating. Not to mention the parks owner.<p>And:\nAt least 7 people arrested today picked off from the back of marches for nothing #takewallstreet<p>Which is a misrepresentation, they were arrested for trespassing, something I think the New York Times has photographs of. I for one think that it would be more important to state the facts, that they were arrested for trespassing, thereby bringing light to the fact that the protest is being cordoned off by the city and blocked from entering certain streets, rather than claiming that they were arrested for nothing, in order to make it seem like the protestors are under attack.<p>And:<p>We need technology for a global general assembly to hook us up with other protestors so we can make international demands #OurWorld<p>Which is a pretty grand statement coming from a group who stated officially that they have no demands and intend to put a list together in time.<p>And:<p>THE WOBBLIES ARE CONFIRMED - The next IWW GMB for the New York area will be held at Liberty Square!<p>Which was then retracted when it turned out that someone from the park had just mentioned the idea of inviting the IWW to protest.<p>We got carried away, it's not entirely sure but the idea is being pushed by some of our wob organizers and invitation is made<p>And:<p>6 arrested at march this is the first precinct # to demand their release 212-334-0611 #takewallstreet<p>Which seems really irresponsible to flood the phone lines of a police station to demand the release of your friend who would be released within 24 hours anyway.<p>And:<p>Rumors of censorship on facebook - any substance?<p>Which I find highly unlikely, given past situations which have unfolded on Facebook. I doubt they would pull out the censorship gong for a bunch of hippies sleeping in the park.<p>So I went back to the park on Wednesday to check in. Everything seemed the same, but I was pleasantly surprised to find my friend Caleb from New Orleans had come up and was participating in the protest.<p>Caleb is a performance artist, among other things, and was performing in the park.<p>you're just going to have to trust me when I say that he's actually a very intelligent guy...<p>Hes active in a lot of anarchist and political activism circles around the country, knows his social and political history, and is a well spoken and well reasoned young man who I always enjoy talking to. Ive never asked him what the point of his street performances are, but theyre some of the most humorous I have seen, and I'm not a person who typically enjoys performance art. My favorite show is one I saw him perform in New Orleans, in which he dressed in a tutu, wrote the word ART in chalk on the sidewalk, shoved a slide whistle up his nose, took off his shoe, and began beating the word ART with his shoe.<p>He was set up on Liberty Street in front of a large crowd of mystified Asian tourists and police officers. He was performing some sort of a marionette show flanked by topless women. Even the police were laughing occasionally when hed get up close to them.<p>After the performance I talked to him about the protestors. He was a perfect example of the type of person participating that Walter was fed up with and that had seemingly shown up only to be part of a spectacle. I said most of the same things as Walter, that I thought they were acting like a bunch of brats who didnt want to protest as much as they just wanted free pizza and a campout. I mentioned that most of them just seemed to be on the internet fucking around and that by comparing themselves to the ""Arab Spring"" they were trivializing revolution.<p>He disagreed. Revolutions dont happen the way they used to, he said. And in America they probably wont ever again. I think its more important to be sitting here talking about it online than it is to be marching. The world is run by the media. Its important to understand that, and Im comfortable with manipulating it. Maybe more people could be marching, but I think what theyre doing is just as important. Everything happens in the media. Theyre raising our visibility.<p>I disagreed and said that pseudo-activism does more damage than good. Theyre out here calling themselves anarchists, I said. Anarchism is not chaos. Anarchism requires even more responsibility than other forms of governance. Its cells functioning independently, but there has to be coordination, or cohesion to some extent, otherwise nothing gets accomplished. Just sitting around tweeting that theyre protesting, and finding an eager audience online is whats preventing them from actually protesting and enacting any real change. They say theyre doing something that theyre not, and then a bunch of people agree with them that they are doing it, so theyre satisfied with the response they get.<p>Listen, he said, most anarchists today are either Sex Pistols fans or angst ridden teens. No one here really gives a shit about anarchism. If some stupid hippie wants to get up and call himself an anarchist and rant about capitalism thats fine with me. Its one more person in the park and one less person in some skyscraper bundling toxic mortgages. That's a good thing.<p>I think that adopting that viewpoint is fine, as long as something actually gets accomplished by the people in the park. As it is, the group doesnt even have a set of goals. Mayor Bloomberg has been warning New York residents that unless we see a drop in youth unemployment rates there's likely to be rioting in the near future. The Occupy Wall Street group this week celebrated the Dow plummeting on fears of global recession. Which makes me wonder if they can separate their desire to see financial institutions reformed from their adolescent impulse to see the financial system collapse. One would be a good thing, the other would lead to a depression and to much more suffering for everyone around the world.<p>To me, this protest has been less about politics and economics and more about American culture. Everyone is more connected today, it only makes sense that the pseudo-activist segment of society has grown more organized too. And I guess thats probably a good thing. But I have always believed that action without thought is no better than thought without action. I suppose a bunch of people camping out in the park calling themselves a protest will draw attention, and in time more people will show up, and by that point maybe theyll be able to explain why theyre camping out in the park, beyond the proto-anarchist nah man, everythings all fucked up, its gotta change, from the way it is now, everythings just gotta change, bullshit line that I was given from most of the people I spoke with at the protest. If the protest is about TARP then protest TARP. If its about war then protest the multiple wars were in. But dont just sit there and eat pizza and send out Twitter pictures of yourself saying that youre protesting. If you start to change what defines a protest into surfing the internet and uploading self-portraits no one in society is going to benefit from it.<p>A few months ago there was a street fair in my neighborhood. People set up on the street selling art, performing plays, etc. One group was set up at the corner and they were water-boarding each other, as well as anyone that walked by and wished to be water-boarded. They didnt have any explanation why. They said they just thought it would be fun to see what its like.<p>These idiots will do whatever they see on television, my friend Matthew remarked. Those words came back to me when I walked into Zuccotti park Monday afternoon.<p>It seems that as the virtual crowd swells more and more people are demanding a list of goals and are complaining about some of the delegitimizing aspects of the protest. So hopefully their attempt at crowd-sourcing their objectives will begin to take shape. But instead of going to jail for megaphone violations or for setting up tents in the rain, and then putting those videos on YouTube as proof that the police are harassing you, why not just loiter on Wall Street and get arrested for that? Im with Walter, going to jail for protesting isnt fun. You get locked in a bullpen for 24 hours, and then you get released and the charges are dropped and you dont even get to challenge the arrest, and if you do you typically lose. Why go through all of that trouble over a permit violation for a megaphone? There are so many other non-violent things worth getting arrested for, choose your battles.<p>In Support,\nThomas Monopoly",1316880396

Many of us have experimented wild nights and tried to piece together what happened the next morning. Well, this is over. Last Night...? records your location automatically so that you can check out your route the next morning.<p>If you want to have a look: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/last-night.../id466239544?ls=1&mt=8<p>I think many of us have had this experience already: when you go out, have a great night, a bit too many drinks too, and wake up the next morning wondering what happened exactly. Where did you go? Did you stay at the same bar all night long? What time did you come back? How?<p>I have been developing iPhone apps as a freelance developer for a year now and thought it was high time I tackled this problem with a personal app. After 3 weeks of intense work and testing I give you: Last Night...?<p>What does it do?\nOnce launched, it records your location in the background every 60 seconds/70 meters and a bunch of details such as the time, speed, accuracy, battery level and exact latitude and longitude. These different locations are then displayed in a table view. Each of the elements are clickable and let you see: the location you selected on a map, the whole route you followed that day, and details on the location you selected.<p>And because people usually stay a long time at the same bar, I implemented a pause mode that is triggered automatically after staying 10 minutes at the same location and which uses radio towers to detect when you start moving again. This mode allows battery power saving, and the active mode restarts automatically after you move a few hundred meters.\nOf course if you want to stop monitoring your location for some reason or another and then start monitoring again, you can do so manually. As for your data, you can back it up by emailing it to yourself as an XML file.<p>Is it only for nights out?\nOf course not! If you're bad with directions this app can help you rediscover the brilliant hidden restaurant you stumbled upon, or show a friend where the shortcut you take is to get to the office, or check that you were respecting the speed limit if you're learning to drive. Possibilities are endless!<p>Did you test it?\nOf course! I can tell you it was very ""interesting"" to monitor where I went, stopped, and what time I came back from my night out in Nice's old city centre! I also used it to monitor at what time I left home, arrived at work, and where I hit the slowest traffic.<p>What's next?\nThe next big step will be to include an option to let people turn off the pause mode. This way, they can monitor their movements more accurately if they don't mind using a bit more battery power.\nThe next update will also include translations in Spanish, Catalan and German. \nAnd if I have time I will also include an option to change the speed from km/h to miles/h, as well as a bunch of other improvements I'm thinking about.",1316880192

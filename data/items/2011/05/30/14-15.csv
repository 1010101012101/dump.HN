2599551,comment,2599012,2599012,15,0,PaulHoule,,,"Errors are bad.  Errors don't respect encapsulation.  No amount of design work will anticipate a SomebodyPouredACokeOnARouterInDetroit exception.  If a system is composable,  there's alway the chance that some subsystem is going to throw an error that wasn't anticipated.<p>Things like Either[A,B] make me cringe because they're just like what we used to do back in the 1980's in C.  You know,  it used to be that you wanted to write<p>int doAandB(x,y) {\n     return A(x)+B(y);\n}<p>but then you had to deal with error values,  and it turns out that A and B never returned a negative integer so you'd write<p>int doAandB(x,y) {\n    int a,b;\n    a=A(x);\n    if (a==-1)\n        return -1;<p><pre><code>    b=B(x);\n    if (b==-1)\n        return -1;\n\n    return a+b; </code></pre>\n}<p>3 lines of code balloons to 9 lines of code.  Read carefully:  adding error handling has tripled the size of this code sample!<p>That's what exceptions win for you...  Effectively you get the extra 6 lines of code written for you.  You might argue that the default behavior of exceptions might not be exactly what you want,  but it's much better than the first example I wrote...  Aborting is a better default behavior than barreling past an error.<p>Now,  Either[A,B] is better than returning an in-band signal like -1,  but still requires you to write the bulky error handling code.<p>A real advantage of having something like Either[A,B] is when you're using asynchronous communications.  Just the other day,  I was dealing with something that used Scala actors and it turned out that sometimes the ""business end"" of the actor would fail with an Exception.  If you catch the Exception in the actor and send it in a message to the next actor,  it lets the next actor see the Exception and decide what it wants to do about the failure.<p>As for variance of Exceptions,  that's a pipe dream.  Imagine a system that has a subsystem that looks something up in a 'database'.  That 'database' could be an in-RAM lookup table (never throws exceptions), it could be an on-disk lookup table (can throw IOException), it could be a web service (can throw networking-related exceptions),  or it could be using something like JDBC (which could throw it's own exceptions).<p>If you constrain the kind of exceptions that can be thrown by the subsystem,  you either destroy the composability of the system or you 'dump-down' the error information that's available to the executive level of the software.<p>Now,  if you REALLY want to move forward but not back with composability of error handling,  what's needed is some mechanism that the executive level gets 'hints' that would help it deal with the error.  That is,  lets it answer questions like:<p>(i) if I try this again immediately,  is it likely that this will succeed?\n(ii) if I try this again in five minutes,  is it likely that this will succeed?\n(iii) was this error caused by specific bad data I sent,  or  is this subsystem in a completely failed state...  etc.",1306767447

2599534,comment,2598026,2598327,3,0,Tiomaidh,,,"That's a very valid question, and now that I've made my decision, I keep thinking, ""Maybe I should've applied to MIT...maybe I should've applied to Berkeley...my college guidance counselor used to work in CMU admissions, and told me that I would certainly get in--maybe I should've applied there...."" But I didn't, here's what happened:<p>I made the following realizations:<p>1. People go to college to learn a lot more than Computer Science (my major).<p>2. As such, I want a college with a great community/environment (and even good gened classes), not just a great CS program.<p>3. There's something of a rift between academic CS and real-world programming. I'm not saying CS is worthless, but effective programmers need a lot more than an undergrad CS degree.<p>3.5. Also, if I do want to learn more CS, I can always try to go to MIT/Berkeley/CMU for grad school.<p>4. With sites like HN, Stack Overflow, and everything that's Googleable--and with decent laptops easily obtainable--it's <i>really</i> easy to teach yourself a lot of programming. I took CS in high school, but know a LOT more than what was taught. Why? Doing stuff on my own time. I see no reason why this can't continue in college.<p>5. There's many summer opportunities available--internships with Google (or many other places), research with one of my professors (Him, when I was a HS junior: ""Additionally, we hope to start summer student research programs in a year or two--the funding...is already there. I in particular would love to have a student enthusiastic about [functional programming] as a researcher.""), or even just having 8-16 hours a day to hack on my own projects.<p>I'm a Christian, so #2 strongly suggested that I should go to a Christian college. I cockily applied to only one school--Wheaton College, IL--and got in EA. It's not a bad school academically (the Princeton Review called it ""The Harvard of all Christian schools"" (which might be an exaggeration) (PS: Wheaton people jokingly call Harvard ""The Wheaton of post-modern secular humanism"")), and I <i>really</i> like everything about it besides the academics. Oh, and extra bonuses:<p>1. I sat in on several CS classes, and a) The classes are small, and the students seem to have excellent relationships with each other and the professor. b) They just got a spanking new science building, which is very very nice.<p>2. I took a bunch of AP tests, and did very well on them, and as such will almost certainly come in with sophomore standing. If I get a crazy startup going, I can leave college after three years :)<p>3. My parents told me that I could go wherever I wanted and they'd figure out some way to pay for it (somehow...). Wheaton not only gave me the ""Presidential Scholarship"" (given to students who make a certain academic cut), but gave me a nice extra scholarship because of my National Merit Finalist standing. This is in addition to need-based aid, I think. Not a full ride, but still ""better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick"", as my dad would say.<p>So YMMV, but this is what I'm up to. Good luck!<p><i>Edit: I say this not to show off or anything, but to give let you know where I stand academically: 35 ACT, SAT 800 Math, 740 Reading, 630 Writing (oops...), 220 PSAT (I took all those tests only once), 4 on AP Euro sophomore year, 5 on all five APs last year, almost certainly a 5 on three this year, and a 4 or 5 on the two AP Physics C tests. And ~3.54 unweighted GPA at a prep school.</i>",1306767158

2599529,comment,2598643,2599013,7,0,kd0amg,,,"A lot of what gets taken out or changed by the optimizer comes from earlier parts of the compiler. Producing IR code to match the AST is much easier when you just focus on the tree node you're currently at and don't look around at the rest of the tree too much. Consider the recursive structure of the source code. A while loop is made up of a condition expression and a loop body. The condition expression can be made up of smaller expressions, which themselves may have more expressions as subcomponents. When producing IR code for the loop, you'd do something like<p><pre><code>  label for top of loop\n  [code to check condition]\n  branch to end of loop based on condition check\n  [code for loop body]\n  jump to top of loop\n  label for end of loop\n</code></pre>\nThen you recursively generate the code for the loop's condition and body. When generating code for the condition check, you may have some subexpressions appear multiple times within the expression, even as simple as using the same variable twice. Neither of the AST nodes for referencing that variable can have the other as its parent (a simple variable reference is a leaf), so you'd have to do something extra in the IR code generator to remember having recently loaded that variable into a register. It's simpler to let the optimizer determine that a variable has already been loaded and does not need to be loaded again. Even a aimple optimization technique (local value numbering, essentially giving an ID number to every value you put in a register) is enough to determine that the variable was loaded earlier in the computation of this expression (this technique can actually detect arbitrarily large common subexpressions given a well-behaved front-end). Global control flow analysis can detect redundant computation across multiple expressions -- it checks whether some expression will have already been evaluated[1] and where its result would be kept. The optimizer can also detect when the result of an expression never actually gets used[1].<p>Realistically, the optimizer is not the only phase that would be aware of optimization issues, but detailed, architecture-specific stuff can be handled by the back-end.<p>[1] These are actually undecidable problems. The compiler cannot catch all cases of them without also getting false positives, so the general approach is to look for situations which are guaranteed to be true positives (e.g. all control flow paths leading into this expression calculated it earlier).",1306767068

The network can't transmit data because a remote computer doesn't respond[0], so it passes an error to the network library, which passes an error to an RPC dispatcher, which passes an error to the high-level RPC interface, which finally produces an error at the site of your RPC call, where you can decide what to do.<p>If you don't have exceptions, you must write all of this error handling code yourself. Plus, if you need to pass the error higher than the call site to make a good decision, you must write that too. However, if you have exceptions, you can avoid writing most of the error passing code, and you can group error handling logic in the same place. You get more flexibility in structuring and refactoring your code, in exchange for encountering problems when things unexpectedly go out of scope.<p>[0] This certainly passes my 'exceptional circumstance' threshold, since success is no longer possible.",1306766498

8545988,comment,8545502,8545974,0,0,induscreep,,,"> if they have an I-485 application pending for six months and an approved I-140<p>That is related to a green card. And yes, employers typically try to file your I-140 under EB-3. This means that you need to wait 10+ years before your priority date becomes current. Once the PD is current, you can file your I-485. After another 6 months elapse, ONLY THEN can you invoke AC21. In effect, the employee is tied to the employer for 10+ years since companies only file for your green card after you spend ~6 years on H1B. The decision of EB-3 vs EB-2 (about 5 years shorter) lies with the employer. These two categories of green card cannot be self petitioned, only an employer can do it.<p>EDIT: So to summarize, the employee usually is first locked in during the 6 years on H1B, with the hope that the employer will apply for a green card (i.e. file the I-140).<p>Then, the employee is locked in for another 10 years, waiting  for the PD to become current. And then, after 6 more months, the employee is finally free to change employers.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how this isn&#x27;t indentured servitude.",1414914524

8545984,comment,8545502,8545813,0,0,usernamepc,,,"There are two reasons (both sort of hard to fix) for why contracting is screwed up.<p>1. Co-employment- Large companies like Google or Apple would love to hire contractors directly but are  very scared of being sued by contractors that can claim they were actually employees-not contractors because of the unclear rules around who is/is not an employee. So they introduce a staffing agency in between to become the &#x27;employer of record&#x27; and offset the risk.<p>Things like hiring and paying contractors directly, giving them laptops, keeping them for long terms, training them, etc. actually makes a stronger case for contractors that might want to sue them, which is why you see the weird ways these companies treat contractors (not allowing them into morale events, restricting how long they can work, etc.)<p>How to Fix- Labor laws would need to change, making it clear to companies how they can hire contractors without becoming liable to be held as employers. New labor marketplaces like Taskrabbit, Homejoy, Workmarket, etc. will push lawmakers into doing something soon, but this is going to be tough given how strongly labor unions are against this.<p>2. Non-transparency. Large companies don&#x27;t like to advertise that they hire contractors. They instead give their open jobs to staffing agencies, who are not allowed to disclose the client name when they advertise the job on job boards. The staffing agencies are incentivized to provide the lowest cost engineer that meets the minimum bar and these are usually the engineers on visas that need to find a project soon or leave the country.<p>How to Fix- If large companies publicly share all their current contract job openings (reqs) just like they do their full-time jobs. If that happens, anyone can apply to those jobs and even nominate the staffing agencies they&#x27;d be willing to work through. They already have Vendor Management Systems (VMS) that they use to share their reqs with staffing agencies, so its just a matter of will.<p>In the meantime, we (<a href=""http://www.oncontracting.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oncontracting.com</a>) are trying to solve this non-transparency by crowd-sourcing the list of preferred staffing agencies for the Fortune 1000 companies. Contractors can avoid bad labor brokers and instead discover who the preferred staffing agencies for any Fortune 1000 company are and approach them directly.",1414914384

With PERM, labor certification processing time is now approximately 9 months (as of Mar 2010).[33]<p>>Because of AC21, the H-1B employee is free to change jobs if they have an I-485 application pending for six months and an approved I-140, and if the position they move to is substantially comparable to their current position. In some cases, if those labor certifications are withdrawn and replaced with PERM applications, processing times improve, but the person also loses their favorable priority date. In those cases, employers&#x27; incentive to attempt to lock in H-1B employees to a job by offering a green card is reduced, because the employer bears the high legal costs and fees associated with labor certification and I-140 processing, but the H-1B employee is still free to change jobs.<p>>However, many people are ineligible to file I-485 at the current time due to the widespread retrogression in priority dates. Thus, they may well still be stuck with their sponsoring employer for many years. There are also many old labor certification cases pending under pre-PERM rules.",1414914216

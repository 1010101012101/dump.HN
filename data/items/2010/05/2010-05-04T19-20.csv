There was another one where he asserted that taking code you wrote in a job to an interview was fair game. He deserves credit for much of the design of StackOverflow and for his team leadership, but I think you are understimating Joel's ""strategic"" role in this venture. There is a reason why Joel is announcing the SO financing, and not Jeff.

I also make sure it's documented in case 2 months into your new job your boss decides you need to focus on something else and you end up pigeon holed into something you don't want to do. 
2. Make sure there is a solid career path that could help you grow within the organization.  Ask the employer to highlight such a path for you.
3. Compensation, benefits, stock options, bonuses, etc.  Make sure this is all clearly documented in the offer letter.  If they say no to documenting it they will most likely end up not giving it to you once you are on board.
4. Make sure you clearly understand the company's strategy, growth plan and financials.  You don't want to get into a place that will end up on it face a year later.  Many times it's easy to spot such companies with simple research.  If their strategy doesn't agree with you, you will end up frustrated very quickly.

If you lose your job, you're truly fucked because rents can easily exceed $2000 for a studio. Many apartments lack basic first-world amenities in-building laundry and dishwasher because there is no need to include them when rents and prices are so ridiculously high. It's very difficult to save money here because a class of fucking parasites (most of whom don't even live in New York) are sucking everyone dry.<p>Land ownership is the justification for entrenched aristocracy and, in less-enlightened times, slavery. It always has been, and probably always will be. It's a concept that exists for a purpose that 90% of us would find distasteful. This is also why Americans have such a fetish for homeownership; throughout most of history, those who did not own land were at a social level comparable to slaves or serfs. What they don't realize is that if they take out mortgages on bad terms, they're assuming a speculative position while not gaining real ownership of the property.<p>I frankly think it's time for aggressive land reform, and I think private land ownership (with exceptions for small, single-house plots) needs to be retired as soon as we can build the infrastructure to replace it.",1273001391

1319017,comment,1318262,1318262,0,0,phaedrus,,,"This is certainly interesting; lately I've been wondering something similar:  what software engineering techniques might also be found in genes or brains in nature.  This could be summed up as ""Does the brain have subroutines?""<p>I'm not sure you can take the conclusions in the article at face value, though:  they seem to be hinting that Linux (or software in general) would be ""more robust"" if it were organized more like the control structure in the E. Coli genes, where there were many more ""low-level"" instructions with less ""code reuse"".  But this is just a trade-off that is well known to any programmer:  when you have a new situation, do you try to make existing subroutines handle the extra case, or do you cut/paste code into a new subroutine so that changes to it don't break existing things?  One has to wonder how much of the difference here is due to different ways changes must be made:  in the genes, random changes good and bad are sorted out by natural selection - there is extra pressure to keep things from affecting each other needlessly.  (To be fair they do touch on this in the article.)  In a program, a human has to go make changes manually, so there is a reason to not spread things out needlessly.  What I'm getting at is this may not reflect whether one is ""better design"" than the other, but simply that they are the product of different circumstances.<p>But another concern I have is how do we know the design of the E. Coli control structure only reflects what is physically practical rather than what the genome would logically prefer to have:  maybe it duplicates the lowest level worker subroutines not because that is a better design for it, but simply because further reuse is <i>not possible</i> in this setting, lacking the range of abstractions available to a programmer.  (For instance, imagine if the genes represent a language that has only goto for control and no stack (therefore no recursion):  this may be the best that can be done under limited circumstances; limits we don't have in high level languages.)<p>On the Linux kernel side, I think the level of abstraction at which the code is viewed has a big affect.  I think we are viewing the ""machine code"" when we view DNA, but the Linux code was analyzed at a higher level.  Particularly, wherever there is an inline function or macro used, it will look like one low-level routine reused many times from a high level view, but if you looked at the machine code it would not be reuse of a low level routine - the instructions would be duplicated instead.  Perhaps if the compiled binary machine code of Linux kernel were analyzed instead, it would show almost an identical structure to the E. Coli gene with far more bottom level ""worker subroutines""!",1273001092

In the context of the original discussion about job-hopping, I don't have any problem accepting that members of Gen-Y have different attitudes toward tenure in a particular job.  However, as I mentioned in comments for a related posting, the issue from the employer's perspective isn't really whether they agree with your values, but whether they perceive hiring you as a good investment.<p>The costs of hiring someone are such that most companies want to be able to rely on the individual to stay in the role for at least 2 or 3 years.  Furthermore, your value to the company increases rapidly as you gain experience in their particular business - they don't want to see that value walk out the door. Other posters in this discussion have suggested that the answer is for companies to make the job more interesting/rewarding, so that people will stay. I don't disagree with that - creating an environment that attracts and retains the best people is a critical success factor for IT organizations that I've worked with. However, when making a decision to hire, the employer can only consider the candidate's past track record, not some possible future where either the company or the candidate change behaviour.<p>I think this discussion may really be two separate questions: (1) is it reasonable for companies to discriminate against perceived ""job-hoppers"" when hiring, and (2) should companies adjust their practices to retain good employees?  My answer to both would be a qualified ""yes"", although from some of the comments it seems like there are some people who would not stay at a company for more than a year or two regardless of the company's retention practices.",1273000895

I dearly want to switch to Chrome (or ium), but I've grown quite attached to the Tree Style Tabs addon, and I've found the attempts to replicate that functionality in Chrome somewhat lacking. The speed difference is absolutely huge though. It's like opening MS Word vs Notepad: Chrome is just there, but Firefox takes at least a few seconds to open up, even without (m)any addons",1272999836

Collect some data on what search terms visitors are coming in on.<p>* Use the Google Keyword Tool: <a href=""https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal</a> to find what keyphrases you could compete well on. You have to strike a balance between finding something with decent search volume, but not too much competition.<p>* Use SEO Best Practices. For example:<p>- Your home page currently has a TITLE tag of ""onlyforpetlovers"". Something like ""pet social networking - onlyforpetlovers"" would be better.<p>- Your search results pages could be huge traffic sources, but the TITLE tags of them are all ""Pet friendly resources,"" and there are no links to results pages for crawlers to access. If you had links in addition to search, you could have a link saying ""pet friendly hotels in chicago"" with a link to search results with the TITLE tag ""pet friendly hotels in chicago.""<p>Just those couple of things would greatly increase your traffic.",1272999812

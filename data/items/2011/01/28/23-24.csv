Mac OS X and Windows file systems are subtly different in features (hard/soft links, aliases, .lnk files; files with multiple streams; various Finder annotations to files), and I suspect that once you sync to both Windows and Mac you will run into weird issues.

It winds up being just one canvas, the same as jMockups uses now. When you share it, it will be an image, not HTML (though long term an export to HTML/CSS feature would be nice).<p>The tricky part, as you point out, is all the styles. You've got all the background images, repeats, position, sprites, border width, color, style, etc etc etc. Fortunately, most sites only use a fraction of them, which means that at least for the initial version, it doesn't have to handle everything. It won't be perfect, but I've found it works well on 90% of 90% of the websites.<p>If you have any ideas on how to improve the tool itself, let me know. Thank you again for the feedback.",1296258526

2153997,comment,2153809,2153931,0,0,nbpoole,,,"Yes. Sort of. ;-)<p>The standard way I've seen is to do this when the user logs in: if in checking their password you notice they're using the old hashing scheme, you use the plaintext password provided by the login process to generate a hash using the new scheme.<p>For example, lets say you're a PHP function that takes in $username and $password (both plaintext). You're ""upgrading"" from unsalted MD5 to unsalted SHA1 (NOTE: DO NOT DO THIS IN REAL LIFE. READ <a href=""http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/</a> AND UNDERSTAND WHY UNSALTED MD5 / SHA1 SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR PASSWORD SECURITY). Your code to upgrade the hashes would look something like this:<p><pre><code>  if (md5($password) === $cur_user['password'])\n      $cur_user['password'] = sha1($password);\n</code></pre>\nNow, you may have realized that there's a flaw here. Since the server uses the hash for verification, it can't be 100% sure that the plaintext password is actually correct. If there's a collision (two plaintexts hashing to the same value), you could inadvertently store the wrong password in your new hash.<p>In this case, the problem is that passwords longer than eight characters are silently truncated. So, if my password is something like supersecretpassword, I could also enter supersec and have it accepted (since they hash to the same value). That would be a problem for Amazon, since someone could make a typo in their password and have the wrong value stored in the new hash.",1296258383

Syncplicity could sync every folder on your computer until you hit our quota.""<p>I think I had started to use Dropbox because of its popularity on LifeHacker and other sites.  One of my first complaints was that I was required to use a single ""My Dropbox"" folder instead of being able to use my own folder structure.  However, I quickly adapted to the Dropbox model and realized that for every computer that's connected to Dropbox, everything that's in the Dropbox folder gets synchronized and everything that is not in the Dropbox folder is not.

I have very limited time to find comics and am very specific about what I like to read, so would love recommended reading presented to me, i.e. browse by genre/rating etc. I only quickly reviewed the site without logging in and it didn't seem to offer these options. I'll happily sign up when this is possible, and would receive a weekly recommended reading list also (with # of pages please! Rarely can I dedicate time to a long novel unless in small pieces over time). Bookmarked for hope of these future options.",1296256119

The media could easily boil this down to ""a small number people felt sites they liked were under-ranked, so Google moved them up a week later.""<p>I mention this because Google often talks publicly about being entirely algorithmic, and elements of this narrative feel human.",1296256028

If they could make the rest of their country like the capital and the other places I was shown, then it would be a really nice country in the political sense.

It's just difficult to focus on your core competency when a simple product sounds boring on paper. It's so much harder to pitch to a VC or potential employee.

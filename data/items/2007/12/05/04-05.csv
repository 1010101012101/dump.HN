People reuse passwords. The credentials they are using for your site could be the same for their bank.<p>Oh, and make sure to hash the passwords in your database. BCrypt is good for this task. Best not to try rolling your own methods (as has been pointed out here on YC news before).",1196829482

Instead they used the weasely ""We apologize"" thing, which always rubs me the wrong way.<p>",1196829353

Semantic misunderstanding is at the root of many disagreements.<p>In this case, the video uses the term bubble specifically as it was used to describe the tech bubble in the late 90s.  The video offers a number of cues to suggest this is the intended meaning of the word.<p>There will always be overvaluations and undervaluations in the stock market.  That's the nature of investment risk.  What's missing here is a widespread pattern.  This is like worrying that Xerox was overvalued for their Palo Alto Research lab-- a valid concern for Xerox stockholders maybe, but no concern at all for the rest of the world.<p>",1196827636

258655,comment,258344,258524,0,0,ardit33,,,"I think this kinds of article resonates with the hacker community, which tend to be in the geekier side, and male, and younger.<p>Most guys in their 20s have had some kind of trouble with dating at some point,  the people that spend an inordinary amount of time in front of the computer, and interested in ""un-exiting stuff"", such as science, physics, mathematics, will have even harder time to find good mates.<p>I am in my 20s too, and have all my stuff together, and I manage to find dates, but it is really hard to actually find a good relationship.  Why?  Women in their 20s get an disproprotionate amount of attention, and have a larger set of choices.   And dealing with women in their 20s is even harder (unless you are willing to play games).  Too be fair, both guys and girls in their early 20s seem not to know what they want.<p>So, there is actually some kind of personal satisfaction (or schafenfreude) when you learn that eventually there is some kind of fairness to life, and their is a payback for all the partying and careless dating, and that things will get better if you are a guy.<p>And since most of comunnity in here are guys, things like this will get upvoted.",1217213690

http://www.extension.harvard.edu/2008-09/courses/10228.jsp .<p>It is a lab electronics course based on ""The Art of Electronics"" by Horowitz and Hill. If you take it both semesters it goes from basic electronics all the way to chip design. At the moment I am stumbling along with my copy of Horowitz and Hill and TechShop help.<p>Does anyone know if there is a course similar to the one I listed above offered anywhere in the Bay Area?",1217213372

This is significant because the study specifically analyses self-reported survey responses for, as the title suggests, aspirations, attainments and satisfaction. And they are quite particular about the factors that are taken into account in their analysis, for example: happy marriage status, ""big ticket"" consumer durables, number of kids, etc<p>It would be hard to argue that aspiring for a 7L washing machine (and subsequently attaining it) constitutes the same happiness as a happy marriage, which is what this study asserts (from my cursory read of the paper, they don't normalise or put weights on the factors).<p>Overall the study is dubious, sophomoric at best. I had quite a few of criticisms of the methodology while reading through the paper. If they're not going to be rigorous about it, they should just not bother doing these kinds of studies, presumably only to confirm their own pre-conceived biases. The biases are obviously mainstream too, as is evidenced by all the pop psychology comments here.",1217213222

Because that is what you're doing now.<p>Secondly, the writer, editor, and most-quoted person in the article are all women.  Their article contains text that says that 20 year old males have lots of happiness to look forward to--the prime audience of this site.  Therefore, I doubt the story was voted up because of what you perceive is a negative write up about women; more likely it was because the submission title mentioned that men get happier as they age.<p>I've also seen inappropriate comments.

258618,comment,258488,258557,0,0,DenisM,,,"Well if you don't want to get into details that's a fine position to take. However if you always follow the crowd and never get into details yourself you will never win anything. There are nuances to Russian situation and if you figure them out while others don't you may have an advantage in certain areas. So here come nuances:<p>Energy industry is insanely profitable and was devoured by Putin's government. Telecom industry is also insanely profitable and was left alone. Why so?<p>For one, energy was originally privatized with violations (aka stolen) from the government in the 90s, whereas telecoms have mostly grown by themselves. Putin has actually offered oligarchs truce - they keep the money but return the companies back. Some agreed and live very well (Abramovich), others disagreed and are now in exile (Berezovski) or jail (Khodorkovski). Putin can be blamed for nailing them on taxes instead of original theft, but hardly anyone blames US for doing the same to Al Capone, right?<p>Second difference lies in nature of energy industry itself. Energy is a weapon as Putin has demonstrated us in his treatment of neighboring states. Telecom is not. So, don't hoard Putin's favorite weapon.<p>Then there are advantages to building DCs in Russia:<p>1) Energy is cheap there. At some point they actually brought aluminum ore from Africa to process in Russia and shipped it back, because energy was so cheap. Why is it cheap? Because of subsidies. EU is (was?) going nuts over it, but I don't think Putin budged. Energy subsidies are kind of important in cold climates.<p>2) Talent is plentiful.<p>3) Europe, China and Japan are close by<p>4) Real estate is cheap in the areas where you would typically build a DC compared to Europe or Japan.",1217210666

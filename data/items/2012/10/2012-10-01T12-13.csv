Drupal does not offer that freedom. Not even with 20+ modules is it possible to have exactly that login/invitation-workflow that many clients demand. Simply because it makes a lot of assumptions about the login-workflow.<p>This is why I (and I have been eating grass on both sides of the fence for over 5 years) know, for sure, that for me and my projects, Rails is the best choice.<p>Had I not invested so much in learning Ruby, Rails and its community, I would have gone for Python/Django, as that community and filosophy fits even better with my workflow.<p>But, Rails is great. Not as a fanboy, but as someone who has developed Rails, Symfony, Cake, fromscratch, Wordpress, and lots, lots of Drupal-systems over the year.<p>There really are lots of good cases where Drupal is the best choice, certainly.

Groups (> 8 people) enter their accommodation requirements, and let hotels bid for their custom. Hotels are notified and have 24 hours to reply via the website with their best offer.<p>The group views & chooses the best hotel deal. They can accept the offer on the website, at which point the hotel is notified & supplied with the group's contact details. The hotel contacts the group to finalize the arrangements.<p>Our revenue model is commission-based. We don't accept payments on the site, so we invoice the hotel for a certain % after the group has stayed. Two main problems we're facing:<p>1. Invoicing hotels after the group has stayed. Due to the nature of group bookings, requirements can change between when they book on the site and when they stay in the hotel. For example, the number of people in the group can fluctuate. We rely on the group for feedback on how many ended up staying, what was the final price etc. It's messy to work out the commission we should charge the hotel.<p>2. Conversions rates on the site are extremely low. Conversion rates for a big online group booking competitor are around the 1% mark. That gives you an idea of where we're at. It's easy for the group to look at all the offers and then continue with their booking offline. There is no major incentive to complete the booking via our website. We do offer features such as group invoicing, but group organisers are rarely getting that far in the booking process.<p>So, based on those two issues, we're looking for alternative means of generating revenue. Some things in our favour:<p>- We generate a decent amount of targeted traffic via our blog, so we can get the right people to our site<p>- Group bookings is a lucrative area for hotels, so they do tend to make offers, even when the conversion rates are so low<p>Any suggestions are welcome, thanks.",1349094093

4596465,comment,4593296,4595788,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"Right. To be fair to finance, there are a lot of companies (and groups within large institutions) that do value technology. Arbitrageurs, for example, rely on technology. (Financial risk in arbitrage is extremely low; but the danger is that, if your technology sucks, you'll be running at a high burn rate and making few trades.) People are starting to get it, even if it takes a long time.<p>The across-the-board startups = good / finance = bad mentality makes no sense to me. It may be true in the aggregate, but I haven't seen enough data and what I have seen shows no correlation. If you're in the back office of a huge bank, you're probably not in the best environment for an engineer. On the other hand, high-frequency trading requires a certain technical acumen that's fairly rare and that people will pay <i>a lot</i> for... and if you're really good at that stuff, a lot of the politics works itself out.<p>I think it's essential to become an XWP (""X Who Programs"") even in mainstream software shops. Unless you have a national reputation as a great software engineer, you need some credibility that's independent of your performance <i>as an engineer</i>. Why? Because if the architecture's bad or nonsensical, good engineers won't perform well because they don't think in FactoryFactories and inheritance hierarchies. You need control of the architectural landscape in addition to engineering ability to perform at a 1.5+ level. Otherwise, if you take a typical software job, you're at the risk that you perform at a mediocre level because of architectural decisions made by other (less competent, but more powerful) people and never be able to convince people that you can take the architectural reins. You need that X (data science, project management, quant finance) to convince people that you're substantial regardless of your performance in the particular environment that's given to you.<p>I am doubling down on data science, machine learning, and statistics right now. (I was a math major in college, and had a couple of 50+ Putnam scores, but I've been away from math for too long and have to review linear algebra to make sense of a grad-level textbook these days.) What I learned in my last startup (where the unambiguously best engineer was demoted and an overpromising mid-20s bullshitter became unofficial VP/Eng, and threw the company into a ""rearchitecture"" that nearly killed it and ruined the culture) is that architectural issues get political fast. Very fast. Like, tachyon fast. To perform well as an engineer, you need to influence (and, one hopes, to improve) the architectural landscape, and you need some ""hook"" that is independent of said landscape in order to convince people that you're smart enough to change it as you need.",1349093433

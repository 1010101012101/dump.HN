The ""don't go back to being buddy buddy"" stuff is just odd. It's manipulative at worst and unnatural and uncomfortable at best.<p>My philosophy is this: If you're half competent at choosing your team and someone you lead isn't performing, it's probably your fault. So before you decide that ""your employees have made a mistake,"" you should probably be clear on whether not <i>you made a mistake</i> first.<p>Are the expectations clear? I bet you they're not. Leading people means exhaustive communication, especially about details and success conditions. If you're not sharing this stuff, you're not providing useful leadership.<p>Have you communicated the stakes? If something is important, don't assume that everyone else knows that. What makes it important? Why should anyone else case?<p>Are you available to help? If you're not making time to check in and support as unexpected complexities of the task crop up, you're in for some nice surprises at the end.<p>When people fail to meet the needs and expectations of the task, are you direct about it or do you pretend everything is cool? Do you look for opportunities to teach about the failing, explain what was disappointing? Most importantly, do you point out how to do better next time?<p>When people do outstandingly well, do you recognize that?<p>The tl;dr of this: getting what you want from people is a combination of being proactive and communicating. Not micromanaging, not being a babysitter, not being a bully, not being a softie.<p>Be direct, don't expect anyone to read your mind, understand you're part of the process as a leader.<p>(All this collected from being led by extraordinary leaders, lazy ones, and outright terrible ones.)",1285880380

There are lots of reasons for this; the biggest, ironically, is that custom hardware is very expensive.

Since SQL is so entrenched and most IT shops have contractual relations with SQL vendors with lots of money (Microsoft and Oracle), I don't see a lot of ability to get NoSQL into the enterprise environment.  Not to mention the legacy software that means SQL Databases are needed, so why add a whole new type?",1285877162

So, not sure what the protocol is here, but thought I'd resubmit -- I hope that's the right thing to do!<p>We are just launching a new application focused on solving some of the lingering problems in e-Commerce inventory management.<p>Specifically, if you are selling products on multiple online stores (as I was) or are selling products online and offline, then managing inventory is a real pain in the asymptote.<p>Yobiz eRetail Inventory, Pick-and-Pack, and Ship are for small to medium size online / e-Retailers that want to centralize inventory in one place that is then sync'd with a number of online e-commerce platforms and Quickbooks.<p>It also provides some insight into actual packing and shipping costs so you know the true profitability of your shipments and allows to you track your packing supplies so you don't run low at the last minute.<p>Right now, we're offering a trial/alpha but haven't launched the app yet as we're still looking to have conversations with more online retailers so that we make sure to build the right things in the right ways.

But know that some people react badly to talking openly about it (or, likely, anything sexual).<p>Now, we can point and laugh (haha, you get embarrassed talking about masturbation!) or show some consideration, agree that some people react badly to discussing sexual topics, and don't do so on a primarily tech-focused forum like HN.",1285877056

Consider that JPEG is using a (or more) Huffman table and a (or more) quantization table. (I'm getting this from wikipedia, IANA compression expert)<p>What if you analyzed all those images and came up with a composite huffman compression that was more efficient than the best guess in the 70s?

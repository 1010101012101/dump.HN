One example of this is when using Webpack, if you set the devtool option to use eval, it&#x27;ll build and rebuild faster than the other options.<p>Another cool thing that you find is JavaScript is the &quot;with&quot; keyword. A lot of people don&#x27;t even know it exists. I think Chrome&#x27;s DevTools uses it along with eval.

I tried to force myself into using tags and agenda when I first started and it didn&#x27;t end well. Instead you should start out using it as a simple TODO list manager and slowly use more advanced features when you figure out how they could fit in with your workflow. I think Carsten Dominik (the original author of Org-mode) put it best:<p>><i>What people miss when they are new to Org-mode is this:</i><p>><i>Don&#x27;t try to set up the &quot;final&quot; task managing system from the\nstart.  Because you have no idea yet what your system should look\nlike.  Don&#x27;t set up many TODO states and logging initially,\nbefore you actually have a feeling for what you working flow is.\nDon&#x27;t define a context tag &quot;@computer&quot; just because David Allen\nhas one, even though you are sitting at a computer all the time\nanyway!  Start by creating and managing a small TODO list and\nthen develop your own system as the needs arises.  I wrote\nOrg-mode to enable this development process.</i><p><a href=""https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2008-04/msg00009.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2008-04/msg...</a>",1448618828

But the new research has shown that approximately 6,000 of the tardigrade’s genes come from foreign species, which equates to around 17.5 percent.<p>>The team hasn&#x27;t investigated exactly how this gene-stealing is happening just yet, but they propose that it&#x27;s a result of one of the tardigrade&#x27;s other crazy survival mechanisms – the ability to dry out until its body is less than 3 percent water, and then come bounce back once they&#x27;re rehydrated.<p>> When this desiccation happens, scientists know that their DNA breaks down into tiny pieces. They also know that when their cells rehydrate, there&#x27;s a point in time when the cell nucleus is leaky, allowing DNA and other molecules to pass through. That means that while the tardigrade is quickly patching up its own genome, it may accidentally be stitching in another organism&#x27;s genes.",1448618687

I do agree that it isn&#x27;t their core focus and that people could host their stuff somewhere else for cheap.<p>However there is something to be said about making encrypted connections the standard.

Only that Whatsapp isn&#x27;t really doing what WeChat is, but it could very well do that too. Then again, it raises question about how much should an app really do... someone posted a blog to HN that complained how Evernote is trying to do too many things, and is getting the note-taking part wrong, which is core to its product.<p>Whatsapp is touted as a SMS replacement. But calling it that is downplaying it prowess in handling multimedia content. Almost everyone I know use it as an &quot;email replacement&quot; instead (after the advent of &quot;100 people groups,&quot; I must admit). Think about that for a moment-- a replacement to email! As Whatsapp continues to get better at handling more and more content, it will start replacing the &quot;browser&quot; on the phone. That&#x27;s upto Whatsapp of course to make it more powerful and realise that vision, flawed or not.<p>Look at how powerful the browsers have become. Tomorrow, if Whatsapp starts offering in-app embedded browser experience, I am pretty sure the dynamics will change again.<p>Oh, and e-commerce happens over Whatsapp as well.

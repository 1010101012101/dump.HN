2579159,comment,2578931,2578931,4,0,felipe,,,"After years of frustration with task apps, I tried to migrate my system to pen and paper and... back to a task app in 2 days! The biggest pluses of an app (as opposed to paper) are quick text search and copy & paste, especially for URLs. After this experience I realized how much I depend on URLs for my daily activities: For example, to reference GMail emails, follow-ups, search results, things to read, etc... Maybe pen & paper is perfectly fine for most professions, but for techies unfortunately we are stuck with (bad) task apps for now.<p>Side-note: I have used so many task apps that I am embarrassed to list them here, and right now I am settled with Toodledo for the main task db and Tomboy for daily tasks and general notes. I am not totally happy with it, but at least it does not get on my way. My ""system"" is a combination of GTD and Covey's 7-habits that I use for almost a decade.",1306227570

is a pretty ugly way of writing a lambda. It's like arguing that java can pass functions via anonymous classes. Yes, technically you can but it's pretty ugly.<p>Another underlying problem is that the only language that can call Obj-C libraries is Obj-C.<p>.NET and the JVM solved this problem long ago, I know that Python/Perl/Ruby also have this problem outside of the JVM/CLR.<p>As far as GC, Obj-C effectively doesn't have it as most Obj-C outside of Apple is written for iOS which doesn't support GC.<p>You could create a point system and call Obj-C a modern language but working with it feels anything but.

Its must cheaper than rewriting your own system.<p>>>So lets say you can use an authenticated proxy to log that - you then need to have an authentication system for the proxy server. So now you have a list of students, staff, etc in your local LDAP (i.e. AD/eDirectory/etc) and a mirrored list in Google Apps so they can use that. But then you have to explain to the users that the passwords aren't in sync, and that if they want to change their proxy password you have to provide some kind of web interface for them, because they aren't authenticating the device via Directory Services, which provides a password-change/password expired/etc mechanism for desktop OS'.<p>I know I asked you to extrapolate on an assumption, but I can't image a chromeos implementation requiring an LDAP server for this sort of work. Simply hardcoding a list of blocked sites and IPs into any non-admins account would be fairly trivial to implement. But yes I agree, if you did this by means of a complicated solution it would be complicated.<p>>>If you hire IT staff and then tell them they are there to ""support"" Google Apps/Gmail, if they are any good they will politely tell you to stick your job. If they want to stay, you don't really want them.<p>The point is the complete reduction/need for a full time IT person. Google also offers 24/7 phone support for all education and corporate subscribers. A ""computer guy"" and these services would work fine for a majority of people.<p>Ultimately, is this a silver bullet for all schools? No. But  Silver bullets don't exist. This is something that takes a lot of load and setup/maintenance from the schools. And in the end I fail to see how this could be anything but a positive thing.",1306227449

2579153,comment,2574204,2574287,2,0,thesz,,,"At the end of procedure you have to have a Forth ABI compliant stack state. If your stack state is in registers, more than one, you have to insert special code to reassign them (or schedule registers with that constraint in mind).<p>Registers aren't good at compressing code the Forth way.<p>Register code for z = x - y (assume all are in registers or stack) could be sub r1,r2,r3, or sub r127,r124,r11, or anything. Register indices depends on context. On Forth it always will be just sub instruction. If y operand is in memory, the Forth code will be @ sub, and always will be. We could abstract that : @sub @ sub ; if we feel that calling @sub will save us little code memory. It is just not possible with registers, because of the context: the sequence ld ri,(rj); sub rk,rl,ri could use any proper i, j, k and l as register indices.<p>As a side note I should say that Java stack machine byte code isn't compressed as Forth code should be, so it lose to register code in Dalvik.<p>As a rule, Forth code is 2-3 times less than CISC code (VAX, x86) and CISC code is 2-3 times less that RISC code (which itself is smaller that VLIW code).",1306227382

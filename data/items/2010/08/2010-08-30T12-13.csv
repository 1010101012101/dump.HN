I had the advantage of having dropped out of my undergrad, so I went back (after 13 years), changed my major to math (from CS), finished in two years and applied to graduate school.<p>If I hadn't been able to resume my undergrad, I'm not sure what I would have done.  Masters?  Part-time classes until I'd bulked up my background and impressed a few professors to write me recommendations?

""What we've done is engage in a set of policies that's turned a market correction into an economy-wide crisis.""</i><p>Which is what a lot of people believed made the 1930s depression Great: first Hoover (an engineer) and then FDR engaged in massive and unprecedented intervention in the economy (pre-Keynes-ian, seeing as how his major work presenting his theories on the subject was published in 1936).  (Which is not to say that recovering from over-leveraging is ever easy.)<p>Those didn't exactly take the shape of the above (from memory, aside from FDR seizing the nation's gold at the traditional $20/oz price and the repricing it at $35/oz), but certainly we're entitled to question a ""stimulus"" bill that cost more than the Iraq war (<a href=""http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/08/does_barely_true_mean_true.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/08/does_barely_true_mean...</a>) that doesn't even look it will accomplish the traditional (e.g. FDR) goal of it winning elections for the party in power.",1283173013
1646055,comment,1645994,1645994,0,0,kls,,,"You know this is a simple but powerful feature. It breaks the mentality of tight function binding and allows you to develop applications in a more broadcast / listen for broadcast manner.<p>This is extremely powerful in the context of UI development because it breaks the concepts of a controller in the MVC anti-pattern that is responsible for so much spaghetti code. It promotes loose coupling among components so that they can be dropped into a page and auto-wire themselves into the ecosystem that is the page.<p>For example one can write a edit account widget that upon completion, broadcasts an updated account object. Any widgets on the page that display account information or that do processing on an account can subscribe to the account updated publication and receive the new object or data set. Further a web service service client can be wired to listen for it and publish the information back to a server in which the server can syndicate it to other clients.<p>The beauty of this style development is: yank out the edit account widget and nothing happens. Due to the loose coupling components can be added and removed with 100% certainty of no side effects to peripheral components.<p>Further, done correctly it eliminates the need for the concept of a controller, widgets become self encapsulated entities, service calls become self encapsulated routines, each and every routine has a clear entry and exit, with no coupling to other code. Thereby making adding new features and debugging drop deal simple.",1283172941

There is no need for a runtime library.  There is no need for a complicated parser.  With those parts gone, all that matters is building the compiler, JIT core, tracing algorithm, and so on.<p>Now that the author knows how to do all that, he's mentally prepared to be productive when taking on a more complex task, like writing his own language or improving an existing one.<p>You seem to think that because it's on Github you're supposed to use it.

But heck, I'm a rental. I'm conflicted on how such a strategy would work long-term.<p>I think the key question here, based on the anecdote provided, is: how was the sales lead treated? Ten times sales volume? 20 times market cap? In such a critical role was the guy well-rewarded for the difference he made? I assume so, but this should be spelled out. Because the whole thing reads differently if the guy got a much worse deal than he earned.<p>Oddly, this focus on what people can do for my organization is exactly the same kind of ambition that is derided in the article -- just the shoe is on the other foot. Of course, you can make the case that the organization is somehow a much greater and more worthy thing of devotion than some guy's family, but I'm skeptical. After all, you can bet the CEO or CFO is watching the numbers. One would think that any employee would be doing the same for his family finances. Respect is a two-way street.<p>I think the article is right on the money, don't get me wrong. I just think it could have been written better. There are lots of little holes in the reasoning. Perhaps this idea of understanding that you do better yourself when you help others succeed is difficult to pin down in the context provided. After all, there are lots of companies. And there are lots of people looking for ""team players"" who will not look after you.

The key factor is, there is no-one who is a manager in a technical organization who doesn't consider management to be ""better"" than hands-on technical work - it's not as if there are pressgangs of board members roaming the halls, to move into management, you have to <i>want</i> to.<p>Now obviously these people consider themselves to be ""successful"", after all, they got promoted didn't they?

I agree that maybe (<i>maybe</i>), capitalism is a crappy system, but it is still 5 times (I counted) better than any other system we as a civilization currently came up with.<p>I know there is no way that I'll change your mind on this. All I can say is that there is nothing ""free"" in the world.

Also, you did not answer my direct question as to whether you have lived in societies that have different systems than democracy/capitalism or the ones with a more socialist incline. The (other) trouble with communism is that it seems that many advocates of it think that it just hasn't been done right yet. Well, I propose that it cannot be done right and any place that had a pinch of communism in it will show it, and in an ugly way.",1283170342

2928292,comment,2927784,2927888,30,0,silentbicycle,,,"Yes. I've read them both, they're worth your time. The thing with most compiler texts is that they bog you down with a lot of stuff upfront about automata, parsing algorithms, etc., and by the time they get to the good stuff, it's hard to see how it all fits together. Crenshaw dives right in, and you quickly get a simple compiler running. You can look into all the alternative parsing algorithms, etc. later.<p>Also, run-don't-walk to Ghuloum's ""An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction"" (<a href=""http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf</a>).

2928279,comment,2927821,2928024,6,0,CodeMage,,,"I guess most of the reasons people mention here can be summed up as platform maturity. People might hate Flash, but when it comes to game development, it's a lot more mature than Canvas+JS.<p>Here's another example of that maturity: on Flash platform, you have three big game engines -- PushButton Engine, FlashPunk and Flixel Perhaps there are more, but these three are pretty damn good. When I google for ""javascript game engine"", the top two (distinct) results are Crafty and gameQuery. Crafty looks decent, but not quite up to PushButton's level. The second engine, gameQuery is pretty much inferior to all three Flash engines I mentioned: the API is very limited and the performance of the demo is abysmal.<p>Mind, this isn't a 100% fair review, it's not an in-depth comparison or anything like that. It is, however, the ""first glance evaluation"" you'll probably get from any Flash game developer who's wondering whether they should switch to HTML5+JS.<p>I'm not saying we should just give up and use Flash forever and ever. I'm trying to explain why HTML5+JS is not a mature game development platform yet.",1314362888

What makes compilers hard to write, for someone who has never done it before, is the scope of the problem you're trying to solve.  Writing a compiler, to spec, for a non-trivial language takes a lot of WORK.<p>Regexes and grammars can be tricky to grok and walking abstract syntax trees can be hard as well.  A hundred-pass compiler may make that part easier, but it almost certainly doesn't reduce the overall amount of work required to go from scratch to a working compiler, and that's where the ""compilers are hard"" reputation comes from.<p>(Incidentally, that doesn't mean the two sources mentioned aren't worth reading.

If you run through your registry, you would probably be shocked to see all the different libraries that have been registered.<p>To Microsoft's credit, running embedded ActiveX objects in Office is switched off by default. In large enterprise networks this can be set as part of a group policy. EMC must have switched it on. There is no granularity to it where you can say 'enable activex for video files but not for flash', so it is all or nothing.<p>What you can do is set it to only allow embedded loads from the 'trusted' network, for eg. the intranet (a great feature which is rarely used). The reason why they attacked with an ActiveX exploit in an office document instead of a web page is because the office documents allow you to embed the entire object so that it is loaded locally - but newer Windows will still know that the original source is from the web, so it will treat it as such. EMC must have had liberal group policies.<p>But you see the situation often - sales guys receive powerpoint presentations with embedded objects, or are creating them, and need it enabled.<p>You can review the various objects you have registered in windows by going to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID in your registry, or using a tool such as:<p><a href=""http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/axhelper.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/axhelper.html</a><p>To change your Office security settings, see this msft article:<p><a href=""http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/enable-or-disable-activex-controls-in-office-documents-HA010031067.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/enable-or-disabl...</a><p>Edit: just to add, OLE is just the old ActiveX.

2928223,comment,2927996,2928176,53,0,ianhawes,,,"Poison Ivy is the new Sub7 (or new Back Orifice, if that's your thing). While it is actually an advanced trojan, the stub (small file it begins with) is relatively easy to detect. PI will commonly inject itself into the default browser's process. PI is a reverse connecting trojan, so an attacker must host the PI server somewhere. PI also encrypted the data back and forth using RC4. So if the attacker is really smart, they'll have PI attach to the default browser and connect to a remote server on port 443. To the average user it looks like HTTPS traffic.<p>The reason that PI was not detected is because the attacker embedded a Flash object inside the Excel file. The Flash file was a 0day exploit that could download and execute a file, which in this case was the attacker's PI client.<p>From there, the game is up. Once inside the network, an attacker has a whole new set of doors to open. The simplest route, if the target is on an older operating system, is to dump the SAM file, which contains both local passwords as well as cached passwords. Cached passwords are nice because they are network logins, however 9 times out of 10 the local Administrator password is the same on all systems because system administrators frequently use the same local admin password when imaging lots of computers. Additionally, cached passwords are sometimes out of date due to password update policies. Local passwords are usually not subject to this, or if they are, it becomes irrelevant since a system administrator hasn't likely gone through and changed each local password.<p>Once you have a network password or local password, things get fun. There are 2 routes here. The attacker can go the frontend route, and attack the internal CRM that EMC has, or they can attack the development servers. Alternatively, they could just keep hacking each workstation, but that is unnecessary. Assuming we went the CRM route, we likely have or can easily obtain a valid login from our first target's computer. Once inside, unless there are solid permissions, we may have won. RSA likely had a record of each customer's purchase, which then had a record of each device and potentially some sort of key or code needed to predict the next token. I'll give RSA the benefit of being slightly smart, so those sort of keys probably won't be on the same CRM, or perhaps our login doesn't have access. Either way, we are in, and with some dissemination of materials available on other drives or within emails, the attacker could easily determine the location of the keys.<p>Once the attacker has whatever he needs, it's a quick trip to LinkedIn to find people that work at Lockheed Martin or whatever company you fancy. Then it's another spear phishing attack on that target to a page that looks like the target companies VPN. Grab the username, password, and PIN (also log the time) and you're good to go.<p>Now repeat the part where you enter the internal network and scour for information. Congratulations, you're now an Adaptive Persistent Threat. Pick your certificate up at the door.",1314361415

Even for the top scientist/inventor/entrepreneur.  I've tried to come up with a list of some reasons why, but I think they all eventually come down grounding.  If you always have someone else performing a certain class of tasks for you, like unenjoyable routine tasks, you'll be disconnecting certain feedback loops and avoiding learning certain lessons.<p>I'll take for example cleaning up your house/apartment/room on your own.  I've noticed that when my apartment gets messy it is usually an indicator of my internal mind state.  It is a helpful indicator that there is something bothering me or something that needs to be dealt with.  If I always had someone cleaning up for me, I might miss these types of indicators, and the whole of my performance might degrade (to the new loss of the world as you put it).<p>I also understand that people in the past have probably said this about all kinds of things that we now have machines or human specialization doing for us.  So maybe what is more important is to make sure that while you are in your prime, or getting to your prime, you learn about which of these routine tasks are actually helping you, which you depend on for your mental well being, and better understanding the trade-offs if the decision to never have to do them again comes up.  Maybe you don't need your entire house to be the canary in the coal mine - maybe a few house plants that you make sure to water yourself would do the job well enough ...",1314361396

I think that after the parents have spent a lot of money sending their kids through college they would rather their kids work for a large corporation and work their way up the career ladder.  This is the case even if a startup would be willing to offer a lot more money.  The perception of a good job is more important than the money.<p>Being an Asian nation, class can be somewhat of a factor here as well.  If some employees are from a higher class than the others, then communication can be a problem.<p>The education here isn't great and the tech students generally aren't up to par in the technical fields.  There are probably a handful of students in each of the top schools in the country which are decent.  I imagine that school probably isn't a good indicator of skills.  You would probably need to find employees who have developed their tech skills through their own passion.<p>The same reason why mobile is hot here is probably the same reason why there aren't a lot of early adopters and computer tech savvy students.  In some cases students might have been lucky to grow up with electricity, let alone a computer and internet connection.  For a lot of people here, their phones are their computers.  There are internet cafes everywhere, but that's not like having your own system to hack away on.<p>Though mobile is huge, the Philippines is very poor, so few people are carrying around smart phones.  Most people don't even do a lot of calling because it's more expensive.  So pretty much all the phones are used for is texting.  The cell providers here have some great offerings for mobile micro payments, but I never see people using those services.<p>The economy is generally horrible, so it's hard to see what you might do to make much money here other than exploiting cheap labor to serve Western markets.<p>Overall, they have a long ways to go.  But the people generally seem content here with what they have.  This is no race, they will get where they want to go at their own pace.  And there's nothing wrong with that.

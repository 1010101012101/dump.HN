Some of these facts might be wrong.<p>Pascal:<p>Wirth created Pascal, the educational version, which was the target of the famous rant from Kernigan.<p>All Pascal vendors extended the language, the most common extensions for professional coding became the ISO Extended Pascal standard.<p>UCSD Pascal, Turbo Pascal, MacPascal and Quick Pascal were the most famous dialects.<p>Wirth collaborated with Apple in the design of Object Pascal, the original systems programming language for Mac OS. Those extensions were later on adopted by Borland for Turbo Pascal.<p>Given the influence of Turbo Pascal in the PC world, most Pascal vendors ignored the ISO Extended Pascal and tried to follow Turbo Pascal instead.<p>Object Pascal eventually became a synonym with Delphi.<p>Modula-2:<p>Wirth spends some time at Xerox PARC and gets to learn Mesa. When he returns to Zurich, he creates a systems programing language based on Mesa, without the issues that plagued Pascal and writes the Lillith OS in it.<p>Oberon:<p>Wirth returns to Xerox PARC, meanwhile Mesa has evolved into Cedar, a systems programming language with RC/GC, interactive debugger (REPL) among other features.<p>Again, when returning to Zurich, he creates Oberon (the language) and Oberon (the OS), following the features of Cedar.<p>Oberon gets used as workstation environment at ETHZ and as a means to teach OS programming at several european universities.<p>Wirth collaborates in the design of Oberon-2.<p>Other ETHZ collaborators create a startup to explore Oberon commerically and extend Oberon-2 further, thus creating Component Pascal.<p>Meanwhile the OS projects at ETHZ evolve the Oberon OS into Oberon System 3 with its gadgets systems, and evolve Oberon-2 into Active Oberon, which uses active objects as construct for parallel/concurrency programming.<p>Wirth already retired, decides to pursue his goals for a minimalist type safe systems programming language and designs Oberon-07.<p>Modula-3<p>The Xerox PARC designers behind Mesa and Cedar eventually join DEC when all falls apart and start designing Modula-2+, based on Modula-2.<p>With their learnings, they eventually create Modula-3 and the SPIN OS.<p>Unfortunately DEC gets bought by Compaq and Modula-3 related projects get canned.",1451339825

Therefore, why replace Windows XP?<p>However, what about &quot;doing better Lab-ing&quot;? Whatever that means. What about better Marketing for Labs?

Obvious exceptions for this would be legalized states and medical use.<p>So if you consider what jobs have high cost outcomes for risky behavior, it will probably align pretty closely with high drug test rates.

I&#x27;ve also spent a large portion of my life in homogeneous places like India and Japan, where I was definitely a minority.  In fact, I rarely ran into another caucasian in Japan, outside of Tokyo, and I never once saw another caucasian during my time in India.  I was the only one around.  You simply cannot be a smaller minority than that.<p>In Japan, I was a &quot;gaijin,&quot; or outsider.  I could not get a loan on my own, so I could never buy a car.  I could not vote.  I was banned from even walking into some establishments, so I&#x27;ve experienced segregation first hand.  I could not rent an apartment unless a native was willing to take legal responsibility for &quot;the great white ape.&quot;  I was also illiterate there.  Nevertheless, I succeeded.  I mingled with the people who lived around me.  I learned to speak the language.  I worked.  I made Japanese friends.  No, I was not allowed to enjoy every aspect of life in Japan, and yes, I was actively discriminated against at times and there were no laws to protect me.  Some people liked me and some people hated me, and I was physically attacked on more than one occasion simply because I was different.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed my life in Japan, I worked within the system provided, overlooked the things that weren&#x27;t fair, and I succeeded.<p>I think the biggest problem for black people in America isn&#x27;t white privilege, but rather the victimhood mentality that many have, which has largely been propagated by the Democrat party and other organizations for the sole purpose of gaining wealth and power.  In Japan, I got up and worked within an unfair system and made it work for me, but it seems in America, many black people sit around, shouting catchy chants, waiting for someone else to solve their problems for them.  I know it is politically incorrect to tell someone, especially someone who is a member of a minority group, to get off their ass and do for themselves, but honestly, if you don&#x27;t get up off your ass and do for yourself, you&#x27;re never going to get anywhere.  It may not be fair, but it certainly is fact.<p>Cognitive dissonance is defined as &quot;The state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes, especially as relating to behavioral decisions and attitude change.&quot;  I cannot think of a greater example of cognitive dissonance than to want something, to think that the world owes it to you, and that, because you think you deserve it, someone is going to give it to you.  When has that ever worked?  Indeed, the behavior is inconsistent with the desired outcome and will always fail.  In fact, we, as a society, publicly denounce white people who behave this way and call them &quot;white trash,&quot; yet we embrace it in minorities as a reasonable pairing of behavior and expectation?  Why?  How is that fair or even remotely intelligent?  Such attitudes are childish and are revealed as such by the many noble, intelligent, and highly successful black men and women that live throughout America.<p>Regarding law enforcement, for every murderer in uniform who shoots a black man in the back, there is a black man who attacks law enforcement, hoping to brute force his way out of an arrest.  Yes, there is a problem, but it isn&#x27;t a single-faceted one.  I do agree that the white community should speak out more and that more bad police officers should be fired and imprisoned.  On the other hand, the black community needs to speak out more against the thuggery and murder that is taking place in their own communities, often times against their own people.<p>Finally, I think your statement regarding those in positions of privilege and power using that position to amass more is inaccurate.  For one thing, it assumes that wealth is finite.  It isn&#x27;t.  Just because I earn a nice thing through the rewards of my labor doesn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;ve taken away the right or ability of someone else, regardless of color, to do the same.  We can all succeed.  Second, it offers a platform of failure, which deceives people and keeps them from living up to their full potential.  Why deny someone that pleasure based solely on the ever-retreating carrot of hand-out promises?  It is dehumanizing, in my opinion.  Why eschew &quot;white priviledge,&quot; then turn around and say, &quot;The only way you can succeed is if we, the majority, give you success?&quot;  It is a lie!<p>All I can say—from my own personal experiences, not only a minority, but also as an illiterate one—is that if you see your neighbor has something nicer than you, asking them how they succeeded and then working to replicate that success will get you a lot further than kicking and screaming and crying into your political pillow will.  I succeeded in spite of the discrimination against me.  I did not allow myself—and again, I was alone and I had no community to support me—to be crippled by it.  Fortunately, there are many noble black men and women across America who have done the same.  I think the best thing the black community could do for themselves would be to implement and replicate that template of success far and wide.",1451338037

Unfortunately, there&#x27;s a certain blindness to business realities among the tech community... a naive faith that the best, most open technology will obviously win, this despite copious evidence to the contrary.<p>Flash had no chance against HTML5.  Why?  Because Adobe had no way to force it on users, and vendors had every reason to want to exclude it, from support/UX to battery life to security issues.  The minute open standards reached a point where HTML5 can take over, it will.<p>But high quality mobile web apps are a <i>direct threat</i> to Apple&#x27;s and Google&#x27;s business models for their respective platforms.  The app stores are a primary way those organizations generate revenues with those platforms.  They have precisely zero reason to move away from that model.<p>And it&#x27;s only with vendor support that mobile webapps have any chance at all.  In both cases, the vendor is responsible for delivering the primary HTML renderer and JS engine.  In both cases, the vendor is also responsible for exposing the APIs to the underlying OS that a webapp will rely upon for maximizing integration with the platform.<p>Meanwhile, from the consumer&#x27;s perspective, they&#x27;re looking at apps, which have great OS integration, great performance, etc, versus a clunky webapp... the choice is obvious.<p>So you have no consumer demand, due to vendor control ensuring webapps are inferior, and no vendor demand because apps are a direct source of revenue while the APIs encourage platform lock-in.<p>It just ain&#x27;t gonna happen.",1451337845

Microsoft doesn&#x27;t regard UAC as security boundary for admin accounts and won&#x27;t fix vulnerabilities that enables software to bypass UAC completely. Under default configuration in Windows 7 and 8 (not sure about 10) all software thus runs effectively under root. Also check what parts of filesystem games will have under that account because by default only files in a few system folders are protected while executables outside can be overwritten.<p>If you can I&#x27;d suggest you use dedicated machine for testing, if that is not possible and if you have compatible hardware then use visualization with bypass for GPU which can speed things to usable levels. If both aren&#x27;t an option then you could test games on a separate hard disk while having main one disconnected physically, which would leave your attack surface open only to firmware overwrites which aren&#x27;t very common.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.istartedsomething.com/20090611/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.istartedsomething.com/20090611/</a>",1451337802

We were tasked with maintaining wireless equipment (antennas on towers and commercials buildings) for about 10,000 customers. Our company had been purchased recently and the policy of the new owners was that any time anyone was in any kind of &#x27;incident&#x27; in a company vehicle, every employee in the vehicle had to be picked up by their manager, driven to the drug testing facility, tested, and driven home to their doorstep and then couldn&#x27;t return to work until the test came back, sometimes several days later.<p>The last winter I was there we got hit with a major snowstorm. One of our towers on the top of a mountain was having problems, causing service interruptions for about 7,000 customers. Our safety policy mandated at least two technicians at a job like this, and one of my 3 technicians was out of town. I took one of the others with me and headed for the tower, which was about 2 miles up a dirt road that was now covered in about 2 feet of snow. Right after pulling on to the road, the company truck brushed up against a fence post that I didn&#x27;t see because it had fallen over and was buried in the snow. The post left a scratch in one of the body panels of the truck that would have to be repaired. There was no way I&#x27;d be able to get it repaired without being asked about the drug test.<p>I called my manager and he made a few calls hoping we could get an exception to the drug test rule this time around. No luck. This was right around the time of the holidays - maybe even New Years Eve, if I remember correctly. The only drug testing center open was about an hour drive from where we were, in the opposite direction of where we lived. My manager had to come pick us up, take us to the center, drive us home, then go pick up my last remaining technician, drive back to the tower, drive up to the tower (by this time it was dark), and then start troubleshooting the problem. Turned a 90 minute outage in to a 6 hour outage. Then of course it took several days for the drug tests to come back, so my manager and one remaining technician had to deal with all of the aftermath of the storm in the same way.<p>I&#x27;ll bet this one incident offset any positive outcomes that company has seen from drug testing, if indeed there have been any.",1451337720

This means that at any time, an employee could be here one day and gone the next, which means that costly adjustments to overall workload must be made at the drop of a hat. Add in the possibility of multiple employees consuming illegal drugs together after hours and you run the risk of an entire team being the equivalent of hit by a bus.<p>Many recreational drugs aren&#x27;t bad. Marijuana is not harmful,  psychedelics are generally non-addictive, and nearly everybody who&#x27;s not Mormon or Muslim drinks. The problem - and risk - for an employer, is illegality.",1451336478

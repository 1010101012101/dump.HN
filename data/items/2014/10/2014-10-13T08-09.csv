8447965,comment,8447699,8447699,0,0,shadowsun7,,,"I tried to post this review on gitbooks.io, but couldn&#x27;t. So I guess I&#x27;ll put this up here:<p>This is a great introduction to building web apps in Go. (I started roughly two months ago, but had this book been around, I&#x27;d have been brought up to speed a lot faster).<p>Here&#x27;s why: the predominant approach to building web apps in Go is to build on top of standard interfaces (e.g. net/http), and to keep things as simple as possible. Heavy, prescriptive frameworks are frowned upon. This is a great approach, but probably strange to people (like me) who come from prescriptive frameworks like Rails or Django.<p>Jeremy&#x27;s guide sticks to Go conventions, while respectfully suggesting lightweight libraries that complement this approach. The guide is never &quot;YOU MUST USE THIS&quot;, instead it always introduces the bare-bones approach first, and then tells you &quot;hey, there&#x27;s a 3rd party library that gives you some useful shortcuts on top of those.&quot; And indeed, each of the recommended libraries are idiomatic and easy to understand.<p>My review is probably biased, though, because I now have some idea now of how to write web apps in Go. But I certainly wished this book had existed when I first started.",1413190125

8447959,comment,8446671,8447741,0,0,walterbell,,,"> <i>Resources can still be included from a variety of domains, but the data they use is exclusive to this sandbox. A script from google.com on youtube.com would be completely isolated from the same script running at blogger.com.</i><p>1. How would that work exactly?  There&#x27;s nothing stopping the script from sending data back to a server for later association with another site.<p>2. How would a site (or the user) authorize specific 3rd-parties to operate within a given site?  This problem is seen by anyone running NoScript today, observing how sites break/work as a subset of 3rd-party scripts is incrementally enabled.<p>3.  If servers are sharing data in real time with commercial 3rd-parties, would they be required to disclose this to users? Publishers don&#x27;t disclose this today.  NoScript allows users to identify 3rd-parties and block them.  If this is done on the server, is there a loss in transparency?<p>4. In general, systems which implement strong isolation are immediately met with user requests to relax this isolation in specific contexts.  E.g. Apple added inter-app communication in iOS8.  How can &quot;contextual whitelists&quot; be maintained for cross-domain risk management?  Should these be determined by the browser vendor, user, or server?  Do we need a multi-stakeholder model like CSS, with user preferences negotiated at runtime with publisher preferences? What happens when proprietary DRM is running in the client?",1413189800

Even if 90% of people died to a disease, people fighting killed 90% of the ebola survivors, and famine killed 90% of the fighting survivors, we&#x27;d still have 7 million humans left on Earth.<p>Nothing you&#x27;ve outlined even pushes us out of the millions of people alive range - not by a longshot, considering none of those things mentioned above would actually be 90% deadly. My point was entirely that it&#x27;s not an existential threat to humanity, and the only things that can actually pose such a threat are environmental (eg, the planet enters a new ice age, but even this might not be existential) or astronomical scale (meteors, gamma ray bursts, etc).<p>Ed:<p>Using slightly more reasonable numbers of disease killing 60%, fighting after killing 60% of the disease survivors, and famine killing 60% of the fighting survivors, over one billion people would be left on the planet. A catastrophe bigger than anything we&#x27;ve faced before, for sure, but not an existential threat to the species.",1413188210

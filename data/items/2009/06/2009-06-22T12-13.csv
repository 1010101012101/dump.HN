Until I played with it a while and put it away and promptly went back to lower level languages (C, Pascal and M68k assembler at the time) because the syntax (or lack of ...) was just too alien for me.<p>Same with Smalltalk.<p>Yes, I discarded them over syntax. Speed never entered the equation - I dropped them before I got to evaluate performance.<p>Ruby is the first language I've worked with that could do justice to a lot of the concepts from Smalltalk and Lisp.<p>I very much doubt Lisp and Smalltalk has much hope of wider use than they see now - most of the important features are being added to other languages, and the remaining ones are not seen as useful enough by most developers to be worth the painful syntax.<p>The computational models and the work done on compiling them efficiently will contribute a lot though. Most Ruby implementations in the work and several Javascript implementations are all over PIC's and other concepts take from the Self project, for example.",1245675162

He complains twice about a horizontal scroll bar when he's using what looks like a very small window. Come on.<p>The complaint about wasted space is a little puzzling too because in the screenshots it looks like both Google and Bing have about the same amount of ""wasted space"". The difference is Bing has it on the left and Google has it on the right.<p>The only gripe that seems legitimate is the image search and it's a bit of a stretch to call the Bing results ""irrelevant"". The Google image results for a ""chi-square table"" are clearly better, but some of the images on Bing are similar or identical.<p>I'm very much interested in comparisons between Google and Bing. This might be the toughest competition Google has faced so far and it's a great opportunity for us to see where search engines can improve. This article, however, is a lousy comparison. There's almost nothing of substance here.<p>I suspect it's a link bait article designed to plug the book that's prominently displayed on the right side of the page.

VisualWorks also lets much of the Dictionary functionality JIT to machine code with no primitives.)<p><i>The evolution of programming languages will never end, not in our lifetime certainly, and probably not as long as we walk the earth.</i><p>You forget to mention a big factor: speed of cultural transmission.

A part of it is cultural expectations.  We still expect HLL to be an order of magnitude slower, even though that expectation is decades out of date, technologically.

We might think that your example above would be a perfect case in which we could parallelize the loop... but what if sum() had side effects, such that it would produce the wrong result if not evaluated in order? What if sum() didn't have any directly detectable side effects, but called another function which called another function which did... sometimes, from code in a runtime eval? The compiler has no way of knowing this, so it has to assume the worst, and this is why it ends up being unable to make all the optimizations that one thinks it ""should"" be able to make. The human looks at it and says ""duh, it's called 'sum'. If it has side effects, I'm going to smack somebody up the side of the head"" and proceeds to optimize in the expected ways.<",1245672938

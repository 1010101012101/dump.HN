On the other hand, take a language like Haskell: It has Data.ByteString and Data.Text, which are array-backed string types that exist (almost) solely because String (i.e. [Char]) is inefficient unless you're doing a lot of manipulation such as insertions and deletions in the middle of the string (in which case you might want to use some form of Builder instead, anyway.)<p>The advice should probably be ""use the right tool for the job."" I wouldn't dream of writing functional programs without lists, but I also don't use e.g. the String type if I don't actually need it to be a list. Lists and arrays have very different algorithmic complexities for different operations.

5752096,comment,5751702,5751702,41,0,rayiner,,,"What stupid advice. Linked lists (and trees formed from lists) are a fundamental functional data structure. They have tremendous expressive advantages in functional code where operating on the head and the rest of the list leads to clear expression of an algorithm, and easy sharing of sub-parts makes certain other algorithms much more elegant.<p>An example is maintaining the lexical environment as you're compiling a programming language. The first response might be to use something like a hash table. But then how do you handle shadowing (where an inner block shadows a variable of the same name in an other block)? A much cleaner way is to use an association list that's implicitly maintained as you recurse over the AST.<p>E.g. in psuedo-Python:<p><pre><code>    def parse_let(form, environment):
        (name, value) = parse_declaration(declaration_part(form))
        return parse_body(body_part(form), 
            acons(name, value, environment))
</code></pre>
For those unfamiliar with Lisp, ""let"" introduces a new name bound to the value of an initializing expression, which is only in scope for the body of the ""let"" construct. Assume here that we're generating code from an AST and that the return value of a parse function is the register number where you can find the result of the expression, and the lexical environment maintains a mapping from a variable name to the register where that variable can be found. Or we could be creating an intermediate representation and the lexical environment maintains a mapping from a name to an IR node. Or whatever.<p>Here, ""environment"" is the association list. Assume that ""acons"" is a Python function that adds a pair of (key, value) to the front of a linked list. Note how the list is never explicitly mutated, it is maintained implicitly by passing a new value for ""environment"" as you recurse down. The beauty of this is that entries are removed from the lexical environment implicitly as parsing functions return, and also that ""environment"" is a purely functional data structure. You can stash away ""environment"" in say an IR node and it will always refer to a snapshot of the lexical environment for a given AST node, even after other nodes are parsed or the current function returns. This is non-trivial with say a hash table. Storing a copy at each IR node would eat memory. With a linked list, sharing of sub parts falls out for free.<p>Also, look at the Linux kernel sometime. It uses linked lists all over the place. Your malloc() implementation likely keeps a set of segregated free lists maintained as linked lists. They do this because they avoid ever traversing the list completely. They just operate on the head/tail.",1369241561

I have not been able to find this data, but didn't look exceptionally long ... as I need to get back to work. ;)<p>There are a lot of blog posts about the myth of the 50% divorce rate.

Age, region, education, and I am sure there are others. And if you input all your data, you get the chance that a first-time marriage will end in divorce.<p>Here's a great, simple description of the Life Table:

I think they've tried various automated and smart techniques to limited success, and it's much easier to say that if you create a profile so that you tell us what your identity is and what your websites are, then we can attribute your work in searches much better. You don't ever have to use G+ the web site after that.<p>I think that there's a basic misunderstanding of what G+ is, even inside Google, and it's our fault for not making it more clear. Maybe things needed different names.<p>Google+ is really three main things:<p>At it's core G+ is an identity service. It knows who you are because you have a profile. Authorship requires this I guess.<p>Then it's a sharing service. Google needed a way to enable sharing in all it's products.<p>Finally, it's a web site with a social stream.<p>It's possible they should have stuck with ""Google Profile"" for the first part, and then the author might not be so upset that Google needs some information to attribute correctly.<p>Also, it'd be ideal if there were standards for these things. Google definitely used to go more that route, like Open Social, but those attempts failed against proprietary systems like Facebook. I think things are just moving to fast right now for the slow process of standardization to be competitive. I hope that when certain _features_ of identity, sharing, messaging, etc. standardize again, then new protocols can be standardized around those features. New XMPP extensions, or an entirely new protocol, to support the features of Hangouts would be great for example. A system for securely asserting identity and profile information (not log-ins) in the way that people use Twitter, Facebook and G+ would be wonderful too.",1369240496

Attrition rates for elite med schools tend to be well below 1%.

My dept bathroom is at least 300 feet away.  (You'd think that would be a building code violation or something).  Anyway its a good extra 2 or 3 minutes of walking per visit.

It work by fining the infringing country. EU laws generally mandate countries to have national laws in this or that way. If a citizen gets a condamnation by an infringing  national law, and after having tried every possible national appeals, he can go to the EU court and get his country condemned. I'll stop here on that subject.<p>So, on a French level, we have work laws (Code du travail), regulations and ""collective agreement"" (I hope my google translation is correct). In computer science the collective agreement is called ""syntec"" it has force of law (it's not the case for all agreements). Collective agreements can offer better benefits than the law, but not worse. In the case of computer science, the employees are classified in 2 layers, basic employees (secretaries etc.) and ""Managers and Engineers"" (Cadres et Ingnieurs) in startups, almost everybody is an engineer. Then engineers are classified with a number, depending on experience, autonomy, degree of skills the job needs, and people managed. This number (coefficient) correspond to the minimum salary you have to pay them, and the other way around, if in everyday work, their job goes into a higher level, their minimum salary have to be increased (if you were already paying them high than the minimum, you don't care). For computer science we are generally way over the minimum, but it's good to have someone check the employment contract before signing it. Employers tend to give lower number at employment, I tend to raise it to their true level, because I value my team on paper too. People whose number is high enough meaning their seniority is high enough are to be paid by the day and not the hour. Those people are paid to work 218 days a year (waiting for some backlash here:) ).<p>Then you have the limits on the number of hours worked, like no more than 13h in a row, sleep time etc. It's not really about salary, it's about security and well-being. As far I as know it's not a issue in computer science.",1369239299

In high school things were kind of going downhill for me until I made the decision of going to a charter school.<p>People learn in many different ways. There were people at the charter school I went to that really didn't care all that much so their experience was a lot different from mine.

Let everyone you work with, and which you share a mutual respect with, know that you're looking -- seed your network. Also go to meetups and any sort of external events you can (user-groups for software products, etc). Because, as others mention, being referred helps immensely.<p>Also as others mention, confidence in the interview is something you can develop. Practice. Practice speaking, practice the white-boarding (somehow... maybe record yourself at home with video and watch it), or use the public forums (the meetups). I've taken to recording myself reading the Harvard Sentences, to hear how I sound. Whatever works for you.<p>Finally, it's just a numbers game, the long game.... It. Takes. Time. The whole process always takes longer than I expect. Keep searching, try to not get emotionally attached to it, because it's such a roller-coaster ride ('I had five rounds of interviews, we had good rapport! .... [two weeks later, after silence: no-go decision]), and lay low in your current job because a paycheck is nice to have in the meanwhile.",1369238445

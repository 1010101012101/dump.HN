241774,comment,241702,241702,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"I think the fundamental problem is that the reason people are on most of these dating sites is because they can't find a date elsewhere.  Building a good dating site means solving that problem:  making dating online more intuitive than flirting in real life.  This is hard, because you've got however many billion/million years of evolution working against you.<p>On the other hand, there are some groups for whom physical flirting is already cumbersome. Busy professionals/entrepreneurs (arguably above-average dating material) don't necessarily have time to chat up people at coffee shops.  People of a particular faith or with a particular medical condition may be genuinely afraid of simply meeting random people.

We haven't registered the domains yet, so here are the descriptions:<p>A) This one is fun, in a sort of edgy way, and lends itself well for a metaphor for the product (which might help cut down on explanation complexity).  It's seven characters, two syllables, easy to remember, interesting, and describes what we do well.  It verbs well. However, we are concerned about its negative connotations: specifically, one of the words describes a felony (think along the lines of MacHeist).<p>B) I find this one slightly more boring, but it's fairly descriptive and is more focused on the community/userbase does with our product than on what the product actually is.  A ten character, three-word three-syllable sentence.  One of those del.icio.us -like names, but we can get the .com name too.  Doesn't verb, not quite as interesting/edgy, but certainly won't scare anyone off.  Feels good, in a sunshine-and-puppies sort of way.<p>I can't tell you much about our target market, primarily because we haven't launched yet and don't have any users :-)<p>So--would a name like MacHeist scare you off or intrigue you?  Or would you prefer a name that's more friendly/neighborly?<p>Also:  know any good (cheap) logo artists?",1215642750

241753,comment,241177,241644,0,0,gizmo,,,"Thanks for explaining your argument.<p>Let's suppose you're right - that playing by the numbers is sufficient. In this case you would not have to keep track of player histories, as you consider every hand without context.  But this can only result in one thing: your play style will be constant. You will always take the best action with probability P and (semi)bluff with probability 1 - P. The human notices this and starts playing very aggressively. As a result the PC will fold winning hands and lose many blinds. What the PC should do is change tactics. Get aggressive or start laying traps (e.g. slowplay a great hand so it looks weak, to lure the aggressive human player into bluffing a lot of money).<p>If the computer always plays optimally from hand to hand it cannot deduce changes in playing style and will therefore always lose. From this I can only conclude that psychological aspects can never be ignored in poker.",1215642103

This is the sort of thing that seems ""exceptional"" to many in the U.S. but is <i>de rigueur</i> in many near, middle, and far east cultures.<p>Is there variation in the quality of service you receive from one place to the next? Sure! It'll vary from one cafe to the next. The point I was trying to make, however, is somewhat deeper. I'm not just saying that service is better in Turkey than in the U.S. I'm saying that the expectation of service is part of the culture in Turkey, not just a nice ""perk"" like it is in the U.S. and many European nations.",1286711873

It's a nice place to be!<p>Let me give you a little piece of advice-- unstealth yourself!<p>When we shipped Freckle, we had $1500 in monthly billing at the end of the first round of 30-day trials, because we put up a little teaser page just like this (for our 2nd SaaS product): <a href=""http://charmde.sk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://charmde.sk/</a>.<p>We had about 400 names on it, from tweeting and talking about it, and a pretty decent conversion rate on that. That headstart was worth at least $18k that year (and probably more, since our main factor for growth is word of mouth). We now have 320 names on the Charm list and that's a much narrower audience, so I think our actual rate of emails vs audience is even better.<p>Typically speaking, ""stealth mode"" doesn't do a lick of good for paying products. Most people are too stubborn to make a paying product to begin with, much less copy one that isn't out yet. On the other hand, people love the opportunity to put their name in for a new product that will help them -- and if you don't capture their email, they'll just forget about it.",1286711042

It's an incredible experience. It's not just tailors either, most larger ticket places do this but almost everywhere does this on some scale.<p>If you ever get invited into a Turk's home, don't eat beforehand and don't forget to take your shoes off.

Is the 8 years mentioned in the article anywhere close to realistic? I don't think so.<p>Not only does the technology have to become better in the aggregate than humans, it has to become so much better there's aren't any crash situations where human drivers perform better. There also can't be many crash situations when the computer doesn't significantly outperform a human. Otherwise both public sentiment against the cars, and legal liability will be too great.<p>Imagine: whenever there's a software bug and an automated car crashes in any situation where a human might not have, the GoogleCar manufacturer will get sued, the local paper will write an article about how Google killed someone, etc. And then, once a year, there will be another story about how crashes are down 2%... that's a lot of lives saved, but which article do you think will get more attention? And do you think ""our cars usually make driving safer, just not the night of October 10th when John was killed"" will be a winning defense?<p>I can't wait for this technology, I think it really will deliver all the benefits the article mentions long-term. But it's a long way off (I hope I'm wrong). I give a lot of credit to Google for investing in it now--this is one of the things I read and think ""don't be evil"" is more than just marketing-speak.",1286710639

Perhaps you should listen to tptacek, wheels, jacquesm (and myself) and actually find someone who's competent at building a business, just as you are competent at building technology, and team up with them.<p>Would Steve Wozniak be considered successful by any metric if only 100 Apple computers had ever been sold? No. A business needs many things, of which a great product is only one. ""Make something people want"" implies you need people (enough of them) to actually want your product. If they've never heard of it or if they don't buy it because of some other reason, they don't want it. If only very few people buy your product, it's because it sucks on some important metrics.<p>Harsh reality: until you get your head out of your ass and bring in someone with the skills to turn your technology into a business, you don't even have one founder, because you don't really have a business at all... yet.",1286710492

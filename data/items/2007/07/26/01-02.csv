I studied CS, and the whole time my goal in life was to be a programmer and work with computers. Then you get into the industry and you realise you have achieved your goal, and find you need new goals. You realise the IT world is so huge and there so much to do out there. There is much more to IT than programming.<p>Theres probably no right answer. I would reassess my goals. Where do you want to be in 10 years. 15 years? Imagine the path to this goal, and I'm sure the right choice will present itself. It may be neither of those options. In fact,  I wouldn't limit myself to only 2.<p>Do you want to be a programmer all your life? (sounds pretty boring to me). This is an important question to ask yourself. What is going to be the best step to where you want to be later on?\n",1185413109

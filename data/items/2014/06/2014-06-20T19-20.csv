7922552,comment,7922183,7922470,2,0,nostrademons,,,"Probably not all that different from the last one.  Economy starts heating up, and the Fed begins to tighten interest rates to damp down inflation.  It takes time for interest rate hikes to make their way through the economy, so they keep tightening.  Eventually, everybody realizes that money isn&#x27;t cheap anymore, and moreover, they realize that everybody else has realized that money isn&#x27;t cheap anymore.  That causes a mass stampede for the exits as people fly away from risk.<p>In the last crash, the economy started heating up in 2004, the Fed started tightening in 2005 and continued through 2006, the market hit a top in August of 2007, there was a slow-motion recession through late 2007 and early 2008, and then everybody ran for the exits in the summer of 2008.<p>This time, I think the economy started heating up in 2013, the Fed is planning to tighten starting early 2015, it&#x27;ll take about 18 months for the rate hikes to make their way through the economy, and so I&#x27;d expect a crash around 2017.",1403294343

7922543,comment,7920820,7921768,4,0,geebee,,,"Your comment really resonates with me, even though I&#x27;m nowhere close to a millenial.  I graduated in 1993, into a pretty bad recession.  It was very difficult to find a job, though (as usual) engineering grads did much better than humanities majors on average.  I ended up doing a series of jobs that allowed me to survive financially, but did almost nothing to forward my career.  I eventually went back to school to pursue a degree that would lead to better employment.<p>Fast forward to 1998, when the dot-com boom was going on, and it was an astoundingly different situation.  I finished an MS (in engineering) and entered the workforce, but I really can&#x27;t tell you if it was the degree or the timing, because college graduates with degrees in Art History and no experience were having a vastly easier time getting jobs.  They didn&#x27;t pay as well as engineering, typically, but they weren&#x27;t stuck at the rental car counter or the coffee shop.  They were getting jobs in marketing, sales, that sort of thing.  Although the market crashed badly a couple of years later, I think that the few years of experience may have made a huge impact compared to people who graduated into the earlier or later recessions.<p>Seriously, I wasn&#x27;t all that much older than these 1998 graduates - maybe 5 years or so, but the difference in experience was striking.  And here&#x27;s the thing - it can be lasting.<p>By going back to grad school, I managed to get myself considered a &quot;new grad&quot;, though I was on the outer edge, age-wise, of this cohort.  But without this?  I would have been someone applying with jobs, with 5 years of non-relevant work experience.  Some employers will be understanding, but they typically go to recent grads for the &quot;zero experience&quot; jobs.<p>During the meltdown that followed, I saw the same thing - recent grads in bad shape.  I&#x27;d say the difference for the humanities majors is greater, because work experience makes such a difference.  An engineering major will usually manage to get <i>something</i> that puts him or her on the career path, even if isn&#x27;t the easy pickings it can be in boom times.  But to a humanities major, it can be the difference between 5 years doing career-oriented work in the marketing department of 5 years stringing together coffee shop and dog-walking gigs.  When that 5 years is up, they&#x27;ll be at a disadvantage to new grads.  And if you graduated into a boom, you have a much better chance of clinging to that marketing job, or getting one of the few ones that come available, because you have an incumbent advantage or even just a whisker of experience that makes all the difference when there are far more applicants than positions.<p>All of this has me very sympathetic to &quot;cohort disadvantage&quot;.  It can be somewhat generational, but I suspect that it actually happens dramatically even within generations.  In short, graduating with an English degree in 1998 rather than 1993 can actually make a very big, and very lasting, difference in a career.  It makes a difference for engineering majors as well, but it&#x27;s the people at the margins (like the humanities majors) - where it can really go either way, where the starting point in that vector field really impacts the y-value 15 years later on that x-axis.<p>As a side note, I also read that grads of <i>very</i> elite schools are also less likely to suffer from the cohort disadvantage.  Again, my guess is that this is probably because, like engineers, they don&#x27;t end up on the wrong side of the vector field - they may not get their ideal choice of first job or move up as quickly, but they tend to get enough of a foothold that they don&#x27;t end up on the other side of a brick wall - as a result, when the next boom happens, they are positioned to take advantage rather than getting left behind.  There&#x27;s also a good chance that they have access to a vastly a better network (say, harvard grads) to get back in even if they have floated a bit for a few years.",1403294149
7922542,comment,7921877,7922487,4,0,adt2bt,,,"And this train goes back to the &quot;perceived effort&quot; vs &quot;actual effort&quot; approach to compensation.<p>Fundamentally, is 60+ hour weeks sustainable, <i>even if you love your job?</i> Many in HN might view burnout, or an unwillingness to work 60+/week, as a personal flaw. But there&#x27;s also another camp that argues consistent overtime produces a poorer product in the end. Personally, I notice a dip once I&#x27;ve worked 50+ hours/week for a couple weeks. I come into work mentally tired & get far less done.<p>Sure, an easy approach to compensation is &quot;how much of his time/life did he sacrifice to work?&quot; It&#x27;s also by far the most common. Additionally, the people who signal that they&#x27;re working hard in through self-promotion tend to take home more bacon. I understand human beings are emotional creatures, but in the vacuum of commenting on how much people should be compensated for hours on the job in a white-collar brain-intensive task, I think there should be more nuance than &quot;Pay = hours * rate&quot;.",1403294132

Consequently, the Court began to limit the circumstances in which they could be granted. After public outcry, James I of England was forced to revoke all existing monopolies and declare that they were only to be used for &quot;projects of new invention&quot;. This was incorporated into the Statute of Monopolies in which Parliament restricted the Crown&#x27;s power explicitly so that the King could only issue letters patent to the inventors or introducers of original inventions for a fixed number of years. It also voided all existing monopolies and dispensations with [some] exception[s]....</i><p>There has also been some historical research that suggests that the &quot;Statute of Monopolies&quot; was a political compromise[1]. There wasn&#x27;t really a lot of thought about maximizing innovation or incentives, or whatever. However, I fully agree that the popular understanding of the patent system has more to do with incentives for innovation and disclosure. But any engineer will tell you there&#x27;s far more optimal ways to explain technical devices and inventions than legalese and claims.<p>On a related note, the USSR had a patent system. With patents. Who would have thought? This stuff is super ingrained.<p>[1] <a href=""http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/papers2/Generally%20inconvenient:%20the%201624%20Statute%20of%20Monopolies%20as%20political%20compromise.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/papers2/Generally%20inconvenient:%20...</a>",1403293970

It was already presumed that an inventor could sell an invention. The real purpose was to promote disclosure of how to make things. In other words to reveal what would otherwise be kept a trade secret. This fits well with the notion of &quot;non-obvious to a person practiced in the art&quot;, which would preclude Amazons one-click. The idea was: Tell us how it&#x27;s made in exchange for a monopoly for some number of years. Spreading knowledge is how you promote innovation.",1403293755

Working in product development at a place like Apple, or Google, or Amazon, etc, gives you a chance to work with very smart, accomplished people. It gives you license to do great work and maybe push some envelopes with what is possible in your field. It gives you a platform to have a major impact on society. It makes other people say &quot;wow&quot; when they hear where you work, or what product you helped create.<p>For some people that is a form of motivation, and even a form of compensation. Doing graphic design at a PR agency for a cereal campaign, even if it pays more money and gives more vacation time, might be less attractive to people than a harder, more demanding job that confers the above benefits.<p>It&#x27;s also important to look at the entire career.

Alice:<p>> In Thursday&#x27;s ruling, the court rejected a patent that claimed the concept of using a computer to hedge against &quot;counterparty risk&quot; — the risk of making a bargain and then having the other guy not pay up. The Supreme Court complained that in the process described in the patent, &quot;each step does no more than require a generic computer to perform generic computer functions.&quot; Such a generic patent, the court said, isn&#x27;t eligible for patent protection. The problem is that this criticism can be leveled at literally any software patent. At root, software is nothing more than a sequence of mathematical operations.<p>The Supreme Court in Alice came to two conclusions:<p>1) The concept of intermediated settlement is a &quot;fundamental economic practice&quot; and is so ineligible for patent protection under the judicially-created exception Section 101 for &quot;abstract ideas.&quot;<p>2) The &quot;method&quot; and &quot;system&quot; claims in Alice Corp.&#x27;s patent amounted to nothing more than describing how to implement intermediated settlement on a generic computer in a generic way, and did not render the otherwise unpatentable abstract idea patentable.<p>The purpose of (2) is to foreclose on clever drafting that tries to get around the &quot;abstract idea&quot; limitation by framing it in terms of a specific implementation on a computer. What Alice says is that implementing the idea in a generic computer doesn&#x27;t turn an abstract idea into a concrete implementation. It does not say that an otherwise patentable idea is rendered unpatentable because the patent describes how to implement the idea in a generic computer.",1403292520

Create an array of random ints, (sort them, not that it matters), and then time how long it takes to compute the sum.<p>2. Create an array of ints (data) and an array of int* (ptr). Set ptr[i] to point to data[i]. Scan the data through the ptr array and compute the sum. Obviously there is very good locality of access to both arrays.<p>3. Same as #2, but first sort the ptr array so that * ptr[i] <= * ptr[i+1]. There will be good locality on ptr, not so much on data.<p>For arrays of size 10M, #1 and #2 cost about the same, and #3 was 5x slower. (This was on my MacBook Pro, using XCode.)<p>But my main point here is about Java, which has been my main language for many years. I don&#x27;t care (much) about its verbosity, its lack of closures, etc. I can get my work done. But working with large heaps has proven very problematic, both in avoiding GC overheard, and in the effects of non-locality.<p>While you can have both true int arrays and Integer arrays, the same is not true of non-primitive types. There is no way to have anything like an array of structs, with the same compact representation, as you can have in C. There are benchmarks showing that Java and C are competitive in performance. But C/C++ can be used to preserve locality for arrays of structs and objects in ways that Java cannot. Java <i>has to be</i> slower in these situations.<p>There are well-known tricks to address this problem. E.g. use two arrays of ints instead of an array of Objects which encapsulate two ints.<p>For these reasons, I would be very happy to see an idea like Value Types added to Java: <a href=""http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~jrose/values/values-0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~jrose/values/values-0.html</a>",1403292446

7922277,comment,7920108,7921062,30,0,mechanical_fish,,,"(I love this question. I have a Ph.D. in the making of semiconductor devices, and I once worked as a troubleshooter in a factory that was making transistors with a twenty-year-old process.)<p>The first fallacy that&#x27;s tripping you up is marginal cost. Just because it&#x27;s cheaper to buy a 800nm-process chip today than it was in the 1990s doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s cheaper to build the factory, employ the packaging engineers, or source the materials (let alone stuff all those things into a refrigerator-sized box). The finished parts are cheaper because the R&D, factories, processes, and HR procedures were bought and paid for in the 1990s, and those things are all still there, so long as a market is there. The workers are <i>very</i> happy to keep doing their jobs, and the marginal cost to keep them working is relatively low, particularly because the yield on a mature process can be really high.<p>The second fallacy is the physical-plant fallacy. You look at the factory and the machines and you think that&#x27;s what it takes to make semiconductors. But if I gave you the keys to a shiny new Intel factory today, you would not succeed in making 80486 processors in a few weeks. Even if I gave you a new factory <i>and</i> its staff <i>and</i> the services of the world&#x27;s leading experts in semiconductor devices <i>and</i> went back in time to arrange the delivery of a steady stream of raw materials, you would <i>still</i> not succeed in making working 80486 processors in a few weeks, although the Dream Team might manage to make some things that <i>looked</i> like working devices right up until you tried to turn them on... or until you tried to turn them on three weeks later.<p>The expensive part of manufacturing is the <i>learning curve</i>. Every one of those shiny machines has five hundred knobs, and every one of those knobs needs to be set correctly or the products won&#x27;t work. Your experts can guess the approximate settings for everything, but the crucial final 5% needs to be dialed in by trial and error. You must <i>exercise</i> the factory, then correct for the mistakes.<p>That&#x27;s expensive because the <i>feedback</i> is expensive. The difference between a broken part and a working part might take weeks to manifest, and it&#x27;s literally microscopic, so you need an entire little team of highly trained QA scientists with thermal-cycling ovens and electron microscopes and Raman spectroscopes and modeling software and coffee in order to develop <i>hypotheses</i> about the problems with your process, hypotheses which must be tested by running more doomed wafers through that process.<p>(I&#x27;ve watched a few thousand people come within a hair of losing their jobs because we couldn&#x27;t make this iteration converge fast enough.)<p>This is where economy of scale comes from: Practice. The Nth wafer coming out of a fab has high yield <i>if and only if</i> the (N-1)st wafer had high yield, so you have to bootstrap your yield up from zero one batch at a time. Your fab is only as valuable as the number of wafers it has made, or tried to make. The factory needs practice, and practice takes time, and time costs money.<p>---<p>So, here&#x27;s how your refrigerator-sized fab is going to work. You&#x27;ll take delivery and set it up. Unfortunately, shipping being what it is, parts will have slipped or gotten bent or stretched. Your humidity and temperature cycles will be different than they were back in Shenzhen. Your ambient dust level will be different. The batch of photoresist that you pour into your hopper will have been manufactured on a different week than the batch that the manufacturer used to calibrate the machine, and your sputtering targets will contain a different mixture of contaminants.<p>All of these things can probably be calibrated out – <i>if</i> the knobs are well-built enough to stay where you set them, <i>and</i> your environmental controls are comprehensive enough that the conditions remain constant, <i>and</i> you aren&#x27;t forced to change suppliers, <i>and</i> you have the operational discipline to resist the urge to get blind drunk and start twiddling settings at random while sobbing. But <i>how do you know which experiment to run</i>, on your microscopically-flawed parts, in order to converge on working parts? You need to order the optional &quot;electron microscope&quot; kit, which ships in a slightly smaller box. The box next to that one will contain the materials scientist that you ordered.

Supply of workers > demand for workers depresses wages.\n<a href=""https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-and-fee-and-room-and-board-charges-over-time-1973-74-through-2013-14-selected-years"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tabl...</a><p>3) Private sector jobs in a good many fields have been outsourced, with low wage service jobs on the increase.\n<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/interactive/MULTINATL0419"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/news/interactive/MULTINATL0419</a><p>4) Public sector jobs have become increasingly rarer.\n<a href=""http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/sep/16/census-shows-big-drop-public-sector-employment/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/sep/16/census-shows-big...</a><p>5) Home prices have dramatically increased over this period (which may actually be a good thing, since the workforce is now more mobile than ever before)\n<a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/02/us-house-prices"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/02/us-hous...</a><p>6) Unions, for all their problems real and perceived, were once actually pretty good at holding the line on wages, but have seen ever-decreasing membership.\n<a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm</a><p>7) An increasing portion of the workforce is contingent (temporary and/or seasonal). <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/_sec/media/reports/dunlop/section5.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dol.gov/_sec/media/reports/dunlop/section5.htm</a><p>Does any of this mean they didn&#x27;t pick the &quot;right&quot; degree? Maybe part of the problem can be found here. However, the problem is so large among millennials, I&#x27;m not sure choice of degree accounts for all that much of why recent college grads have boomeranged. My point is that while students with degrees in various fields hasn&#x27;t changed much, the rest of the world around them has changed quite a bit. Most of it can&#x27;t simply be solved with a <i>different</i> degree or <i>more passion</i>.",1403290983

We are still not quite there. I mean, OpenStreetMap is a great display map, but there is still not a whole lot of navigation data and address information<p>Like, seriously? The founder condemns his product like this? Sure you have to be critical, but not outwardly. I use OsmAnd for to-address navigation all the time. Since the government data import in the Netherlands I never have to resort to proprietary sources. Germany and France too, I hit in some address in Hamburg and it routes me across the country.<p>Not sure if where he lives it&#x27;s &quot;still not quite there&quot;, but as a founder aren&#x27;t you supposed to highlight the good parts?<p>Perhaps this rant also comes a bit from the unprofessionality that we, as mappers, are used to get from the self-proclaimed project admins.

First though it made me realize that you never see prices in thirds of a dollar- as if everyone avoids it and have simply gotten used to avoiding it. I can&#x27;t imagine a situation where ease of dividing by three for money actually adds any efficiency. Similarly, while I do see the value in dividing the day into 24 hours, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t advocate a unit that&#x27;s defined as one 60th of a second (even though it has even more prime factors than 12 ;)<p>I concede that the use-cases where having more prime factors and therefore easy non-decimal division are few and far between. I guess what surprised me when doing construction was that there was a very rational reason for a foot being 12 inches rather than 10- that it&#x27;s not simply a relic of the fact that a human foot seems to be about 12 thumbs long- some arbitrary number accidentally ingrained in some cultures. And as illustrated by the fact that stocks were eventually decimalized and then made to trade at penny-granularity, computers and the fact that we don&#x27;t do a lot of division in our heads or on paper anymore will probably eventually erase most remaining efficiencies.",1407617892

Personally, I don&#x27;t read fiction, so the value of a fiction book is $0. Does this mean that the appropriate price for ebooks is $0? Obviously not.<p>Amazon has put forth a number that is an aggregate.. it takes into account your value judgement, mine, and 100,000 other peoples judgement of the value of an ebook.<p>Which reminds of a 3rd case that could affect Amazon&#x27;s test: people do not purchase a generic ebook. They purchase a specific ebook, and the value of that ebook very much depends on the content. A poorly written book is worth less than a well written book.. and a book on a popular subject is worth more than a book on an unpopular subject.<p>If the book (or books) Amazon tested were more mispriced than the typical book (so they showed a larger increase in sales because $10 was closer to the actual value of the book.. whereas maybe $12 (or $20) represents the value of the average book).. then when all books are lowered in price, the result may be a decline for Hachett and the authors.<p>So I&#x27;ve put forth 3 cases that may affect Amazon&#x27;s test.

8157966,comment,8157921,8157921,21,0,exratione,,,"Disappointingly, but expectedly, the stub website for Calico further reinforces the point that they are not likely to soon take any path that will produce meaningful results for human longevity. They are following the Longevity Dividend [0] approach in essence, which at the high level aims to increase understanding of the intersection of genetics, metabolism, and aging to produce ways to slow aging gently. Ambition here is to aim for an increase of 7 years of life expectancy over the next two decades, a figure given a couple of times by Jay Olshansky. Examples of research include work on sirtuins, that has consumed a billion dollars and produced nothing of use, and other attempts to produce caloric restriction mimetic drugs. The near future in the Longevity Dividend vision is basically more of the same: vastly expensive attempts to alter the operation of metabolism in order to slow down aging.<p>Genetics is hot, and it is easy to raise funds for nowadays. See the launch of Venter&#x27;s Human Longevity Inc, for example. But I see this in connection with work on longevity as looking for the keys under the lamp, because that is where the light is, not because it is where you are likely to obtain results. The comparative genetics of human longevity should be irrelevant to work on aging: we all age because of the occurrence of the same forms of cellular and molecular damage. Outside of rare mutations, genetics has nothing to do with that - the same damage happens to everyone. The target should be repair of that damage, not trying to expensively slightly slow the pace at which it arrives.<p>That the metabolic manipulation approach to treating aging has such popularity despite the lack of results is a mystery. The other way, the repair approach, has the same lack of results - but that is because next to no money is heading in that direction. We have the early demonstration that targeted removal of senescent cells extends life in accelerated aging mice [1], for example, and ample reason to believe it is beneficial for ordinary individuals, but it took philanthropic funding to move that research forward at all. Institutions want to see standard issue drug development and manipulation of metabolism because it is the mainstream of medicine and the expected thing: the round peg for the round hole of regulation. This has nothing at all to do with whether it is the best path forward.<p>This all further points to the fact that if we want to see meaningful results in longevity science, measured in years of health gained for people who are already old, then we need to produce results that demonstrate the futility of the mainstream path taken by Google, the sirtuin researchers, and Human Longevity Inc, etc, and deonstrate that repair approaches can do far more for far less money. The senescent cell targeting is probably the closest work to that point.<p>Based on what I&#x27;ve seen of Calico to date, I&#x27;m expecting it to be a more publicized version of the Ellison Medical Foundation as an initiative: an extension of work already taking place at the NIA and in companies like Human Longevity Inc, and something that fails to step outside that box. It will produce general benefits in terms of data and knowledge, and absolutely fail to meaningfully extend human life. This will continue until someone changes the approach to this work to focus on repair of the causes of aging [2] rather than metabolic tinkering to slow aging. The latter is a slow road to marginal end results that can do next to nothing to help the people who grew old waiting for them to arrive.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2013/10/advocating-the-longevity-dividend-view.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2013/10/advocating-the-l...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature10600"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature10600</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research</a>",1407616987

I&#x27;ll try to do my best to demonstrate it. Imagine a smaller economy where there is only 1 firm. They have complete power to set wages, you don&#x27;t like it you don&#x27;t work. (We&#x27;ve already established this would happen eventually if agreements like this were allowed because it is far easier to control wages than it is to create new and competing firms.) What happens when they decide not to pay a living wage? More importantly, what is to stop them from influencing laws such that what becomes fair practice is changed over time? Is it fair to allow a single entity the power over not just the economy but the power to define what is just? We have to be very careful in a capitalist society about confining the limits of what actors are allowed to do because quite literally money often equates to power and with time power defines law. I hope it goes without saying that enough bad laws over a long enough time span are trouble for everyone in society. Unregulated capitalism will always lead to issues for a society because it always concentrates wealth. (Those with the most information and the best decisions always come out more ahead than the rest.) Remember, capitalism isn&#x27;t the best way to run an economy its just the least bad.<p>Also, please remember you can&#x27;t look at a statement in a vacuum. &quot;Why isn&#x27;t it? Those agreements don&#x27;t restrict or infringe on the freedom of others to form different agreements, or avoid forming them.&quot; Perhaps not technically, but realistically they absolutely do. If we had a million worlds with a trillion firms and easy travel between them then such actions would automatically correct, but we don&#x27;t and thus people do not realistically have the option to turn them down. The whole point of capitalism is to reward and penalize decisions. It kind of breaks down (predictably) when one side has enough power to prevent the downside of a bad decision. \nRemember, free speech doesn&#x27;t mean you can run into a theater and yell fire.",1407616850

In the worst case, that approach sends data between neurons on each time step, which is very inefficient in power.  If they do something more clever, I would bet it would start to like sending spikes.<p>It also seems very short sighted to say that if the hardware is not specifically designed for convolutional neural networks, then it is not the right architecture.  It seems like the IBM chip does support convolutional networks, but it might require a few extra time steps to average.<p>Biology has evolved to use spikes (across many different species).  Perhaps evolution didn&#x27;t get the memo that non-spiking convolutional neural networks is the only architecture worth building.

Obsessively measuring $/hours misleads us into thinking that spending more hours will get us more $, which is false for most jobs which actually creates significant amounts of wealth.<p>I&#x27;ve automated away dozens to hundreds of menial jobs (hard to count): what sense is there in comparing my one-shot engineering hours to those of the technicians I&#x27;ve definitely made redundant? Each of my hours will have saved thousands of technician hours over the years: does that make me and my time worth thousands of time more than them?<p>> we still have to work some hours<p>Some of us have to work some hours, but there are more and more poeple whose hours simply can&#x27;t be converted into wealth.

Soma felt a little sparse/rough to me, but there were definitely good pockets.  I've got my fingers crossed that I'll be able to get into a place in the Mission, just southwest of 19th and Valencia.<p>Also:  avoid citiapartments if at all possible.  They're trying to run up prices for rathole apartments, and they are complete assholes about the whole process.  I made the mistake of looking at several of their places on the first day I was out, and they were trying to tell me things like ""out-of-state renters usually get passed over on the better deals and have to pay a premium"" and ""you have to jump on one of the first places you see, because everything gets snapped up in the first few hours of being open for showing"".",1201193997

I am extremely hesitant to release too much information online, and only grant friendship privileges to people I know and trust in real life.<p>Granted, I do know people who have hundreds upon hundreds of friends.  But the question is, do you really care about all those people, enough to catalog by hand what they like and dislike?<p>Haha, maybe I'm just antisocial.

103536,comment,103499,103499,0,0,pius,,,"Nope.<p>Some smart people started the meme that ideas are less important than execution.  That statement is very true.  Unfortunately, there are too many cargo culters out there who take bromides like this to the extreme just because their favorite guru said it.<p>If you've got something innovative, why in the world would you want to give a group of entrepreneurial hackers not only your idea but enough about its execution and strategy to attract investors?  Doesn't make a bit of sense to me.<p>I can already hear the wags saying, ""You must not be very confident in your ability to execute better than the competition.""  My preemptive response to that is that there always exists a group of people who can execute an idea just as well as you can.  Your likelihood of having the dominant implementation of an idea is based not only on solid execution but luck, relative time to market, and other factors -- most of which are not served by giving away your strategy to potential competitors.<p>Don't get me wrong, I give out ideas all the time, will <i>talk</i> openly about things that I'm working on within reason, and will <i>risk</i> strategies getting out when I pitch investors, but that's much different from guaranteeing that the blueprint to your business will be handed out to your competitors on a silver platter.  That's not wise unless you consider your competitors really incompetent.  I think too highly of my colleagues here to do that.  :)",1201191851

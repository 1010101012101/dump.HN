Even in this case, I'd prefer something like<p>dest = mapsquare(src)<p>Consider the possibility that C-like syntax and mixedCaseVerboseNames may be an acquired taste.<p>If you do square a lot other things than lists, it's probably best to say<p>dest = map(square, src)<p>For one-shot usage where defining square seems overkill, and where it's available and idiomatic, I find the list comprehension most readable.",1191124076

61215,comment,61017,61118,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""The whole cell phone industry abuses its customers like this""<p>fwiw, I think it may be less  only where a phone is bundled with a network. In India (where I live) you get the phone from a  cell phone vendor and the SIM card from a network. You plug the SIM card int your phone and you have a working phone. Some networks have tried to sell phones that work with only a particular network but most people buy phones that works with any network and many people routinely switch networks when someone comes out with a cheaper plan. There are even phones that allow two SIM cards to be plugged in at the same time, allowing you to switch networks at the press of a button. <p>Cell Phone vendors compete to bring out more attractive phones and the networks compete to bring out better plans. The customer wins.<p>I pay about 20 $ monthly for   a fantastic plan and have no complaints.  I can change my phone or network independently.",1191123543

61211,comment,61157,61208,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>Why should I have to write a function</i><p>A function hides the implementation.<p><i>to traverse a list</i><p>Because there are different ways to traverse a list. An arraylist is easier to traverse with respect to CPU cycles and memory usage (typically) than a linked list. What does python use internally? I don't know, and I'd just as soon decide that myself...<p><i>square each element</i><p>While there are only so many ways to square numbers, for more complicated things, you are doing to want to change implementations while keeping it all hidden. In java, you are occasionally going to want to splice in native code.<p><i>recombine them into a list</i><p>I may not want to recombine them in a list, but square them in place. A function makes that trivial, and further makes it trivial to decide when and how to do that.<p>--> The real reason is one of readability. More english, less brackets and commas please.",1191122296

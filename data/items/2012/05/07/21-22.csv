The jury makes factual findings used by the judge to issue a ruling.<p>What this article refers to (using poor, imprecise language in the headline) is the jury's finding that Google copied, in the literal sense of the term, the Java API's. This is something the jury is totally qualified to decide. They can see the snippets of code put forth as evidence. They might not understand how it works, but they can see whether they are similar or not.<p>From here, the judge will decide whether API's are copyrightable. This is the real show. We know Google copied the API, the real question in this trial is whether that API is protectable under copyright law. The judge will answer this question.<p>After that, the jury will answer whether Google's copying is eligible for the fair use defense. That is to say, even if they did copy, and even if API's are protectable, was Google's use nonetheless of a kind that qualifies as ""fair use."" This decision doesn't really involve ""nerd esoterica.""",1336427981

The hinge itself would snap because it was made out of cheap pot metal and the 17"" display put a lot of leverage on it. To make matters worse, the hinge secured directly to the bezel and top cover; when the hinge broke, it'd generally break both those parts as well.

It goes against my intuition (and I suspect I'm not alone) to say that a violation of copyright has taken place when a usage is legal within the rules instituted by copyright.<p>Yes semantics, but in law there is an established convention with reference to these particular semantics. The term ""infringement"" refers to, in this context, whether or not there was copying. Fair use is a defense, wherein even if infringement is established, liability is not established if the copying isn't the sort that should establish liability.<p>> I suppose people who associate a different set of semantics with copyright violation would have to talk about legal copyright violation versus illegal copyright violation. To me, the former is contradicting and the latter is a tautology.<p>That's because the headline using terminology imprecisely. It is using ""ruled"" when it means ""found"" (juries find facts, judges make rulings); it is using ""violation"" when it means ""infringement.""",1336427422

Other than the Pell available to low family total income US citizens, the financial package is not scholarship style grants that come free and clear. The student ends up over $140,000 in debt upon graduation and Harvard gets their entire $48,450 each year.<p>The term ""financial aid"" is intentionally misleading and used against naive parents and students in articles and personal exhortations to convince them that college is affordable to them. We don't talk about ""financial aid"" when discussing loans for houses or cars, that would be considered misleading by nearly everyone. Saying college is affordable because you get ""financial aid"" consisting mostly of interest loans makes no more sense than saying that mansions and Hummers are affordable because ""financial aid"" consisting of deferred loans is available so that you won't have to pay hardly anything during the first four years.

The question isn't whether or not Watt's patent hindered steam engines for three decades, but whether or not the steam engine would have been developed at all in those three decades. The benefit for society is delayed so that inventors can be compensated. The only mechanism that is available to gov't to compensate an inventor is to grant a temporary monopoly. That was the market can decide on the value of the invention.<p>Here's another example. Imagine a miracle drug was discovered to cure disease X. $100M went into the development for this drug. Now imagine that it took 10 years of development but would have taken 30 years for public sponsored research to develop otherwise. Now, the public gets a new drug 20 years earlier than they otherwise would have. The pharma company gets 10 years to recoup its $100M investment, but at the end of the patent term, there is now a low cost generic version available.<p>So with public funding, the new drug appears at t+30 years. With private/patent incentive based funding the public gets access at t+10 years and generic/cheap access at t+20 years. I think that strikes a fair balance.<p>Where the patent system starts to break down is when the monopoly length is grossly over the amount of time it would take an independent person to also develop the invention (software for example moves too quickly for this to be effective).",1336426268

GPL v3 affects the former, while APIs not being copyright-able affects the later.<p><pre><code>     It would seem to me that providing an api compatible\n     'shim' layer ...\n</code></pre>\nAs long as your software is distributed along with the GPL v3 module, then the copyright of the GPL v3 module applies and the only way to distribute that module is to respect the GPL v3 clauses, because again, no other license or law gives you the right to distribute that GPL v3 module, other than the GPL v3 license itself.<p>What you can do is to allow the user to install the GPL v3 module by himself. This works as long as the GPL v3 module is replaceable. For instance, say that your software uses an SQL Database and that the preferred RDBMS recommended to users is a GPL v3 licensed database. You could even provide scripts that automatically install/configure that database. This wouldn't mean that your software has to be GPL v3 compatible, because the database itself is replaceable and it is also not distributed directly with your software.<p>Another example would be for instance the usage of GNU Readline ... your software could use whatever Readline implementation it finds on the user's system through dynamic linking, and as long as it works with other implementations, then there is no hard dependency and you've got no problems.<p>However in the case of Tivoization, then direct distribution of the GPL v3 package is involved. And you simply cannot do that, no matter what API layer you've got between that package and your software.<p><pre><code>     Although linking is clearly, in my mind, the creation of a derived work.\n</code></pre>\nNot necessarily. Linking, either static or dynamic, is an artifact of the way we build software, being basically just a protocol through which different software components can communicate.<p>The context is very important here. Let's say that MongoDB would be GPL v3 licensed (with no exceptions), there wouldn't be any other implementations and your software couldn't function without it. Because Mongo's APIs are unique (not a standard, no third-party implementations), would this mean that your software is derived from MongoDB? Yes it would, simply because without MongoDB it couldn't function.<p>On the other hand, if your software relied on MySQL, would your software have to be GPL v2 compliant? No it wouldn't, because you could just replace it ... however, in the case of MySQL the actual client library that gets linked to your software is also GPL v2 and has its own unique API that's relevant to MySQL only, so in such a case you have to find a way to dynamically link to that client, such that your software can continue to function even if the MySQL client library isn't installed.<p>But even so, this is about ""usage"", not ""distribution"". The distinction is important here, because if you want to distribute MySQL alongside your software as a single package, then your software must be GPL v2 compliant, no doubt about it.<p>Btw, I'm not a lawyer, this is just my understanding of how the GPL works.",1336426030

I can explain the reason why this is never going to change (though it may get better with index scans) but I expect you'll just see a wall of text and decide not to read it. But if you never read long answers, you have no right to expect solutions to your problems or to understand anything. So I hope you'll read this, it may help.<p>PostgreSQL and most modern, ACID-compliant RDBMSes use MVCC instead of locks. MVCC has a lot of upsides, namely, you almost never need table-level locking for writes, but it ensures you need to look at the whole table to do COUNT. That's because MVCC is basically multiple parallel universes for data. What you see depends critically on which transaction you're in when you look.<p>For example, suppose you have a process that needs to know the number of users in some user table. You start your transaction, and then another process starts a transaction that goes through and deletes certain users. While this is happening, you need the count. In MVCC, deletion doesn't delete, it just marks rows with the transaction ID range in which they're visible. The rows that are being deleted by the other process are just being marked dead as of that process's transaction ID, but your transaction ID is below that one, so they're not dead to you. Later on, when the youngest transaction alive is older than the oldest transaction that can see these rows, PostgreSQL will actually expunge the data (VACUUM does this).<p>Because of MVCC, there is more than one legitimate answer the question of COUNT; potentially, one for each transaction in progress. The answer is changing constantly. People tend not to think in these terms; we tend to think, well the table has so many rows in it, right? Why don't you just increment the count when you write one? It's not true, because with ACID compliance, uncommitted transactions should not have visible effects until they commit and transactions in progress should not see anything vary during their operation. So there really are multiple right answers at any given moment. The expectation that SELECT COUNT(*) will be fast is built on the assumption that the database has some sort of master count of what rows are in the table it can just glance at. But it doesn't, and to have one would require removing MVCC altogether and using locks instead.",1336425370

Were we discussing a random Wikipedia page and I missed that?<p>> <i>Using the wiki terminology, that's a 30 minute block of time, 22 minutes of programming, 8 minutes of ads. So, contrary to your assertion a couple comments up, programming and ads and time were the correct words, and my application of the word ""time"" was appropriate and accurate.</i><p>No, your application was not appropriate or accurate.  Your statement's structure still implies that ads are a portion of the programming.  ""X is Y% of Z"" implies that Z is a superset of X.<p>Your comment(""Yet 10 mins of ads to every 20 mins of programming makes ad time exactly 50% of the program time."") says that ad time is 50% of the program time.<p>> <i>saying that +/- 2 mins of ads undermines jrockway's double dipping claim</i><p>Right, but I didn't say that.  I said that it was an exaggeration compounded with the misleading ""50%"" claim.  That you're now trotting out other statistics to try to support the misstatement is irrelevant, because jrockway himself said it was 10 mins ads and 20 mins programming.  He clearly wasn't talking about product placement.<p>I also find it strange that you're still pushing 20 to 10 as a ""reasonable average"" when your own reference (Wikipedia) says it's 22 to 8.  Your 17-18 to 12-13 seems to be original research.<p>> <i>It says late night talk shows may have advertising ""49% of total content time"", while commercials are ""36% of an average prime-time hour"".</i><p>No.  That's a selective reading (and a little bit of bias pushed by the article).  It says that ""commercial messages"" are 36% of an average prime-time hour.  They included ""in-show brand appearances"", aka product placements, in this.  As in ""I can see a brand on-screen"".

4238360,comment,4236429,4238153,1,0,Jach,,,"I agree about the <i>physical rendering</i> size always being the same for a point, a point should be more general, but I still think there is some utility for having things defined in real-world units showing up as real-world units when measured on glass in the same z. An inch is an inch, and if it's too big for the display it should be clipped and if it's 100 feet away it should be unreadable. It would be useful for classes of devices--instead of special casing for resolutions, ratios, and densities, special case for desktops/laptops, phones, tablets, home projectors, conference projectors, etc.<p>But what's really missing is the explicit presence of a projection surface and the ability to adjust the factors that go into the calculation when projecting. It would be nice to have a unit that lets you say ""I want this item to be as tall as the subjective inch if a person holds a ruler one foot away from them."" That way no matter how close or far away I'm looking at the item (assuming the display is large enough--too small and too far will get it clipped, too few pixels will get it blocky), if I hold a ruler one foot away from me the item will be ""as tall"" as the ruler's inch mark.

You build a company on relationships and the key influencer's leave and your user base is eroded. So just who is Jaiku? <p>I ran into Jaiku [0] after listening to Bruce Stirling. Bruce is a science fiction writer, appeared on the first cover of Wired and writes in his blog, <i>beyond the beyond</i> [1]. But I think he's a better orator than writer. Listening to a talk he gave at SWSX on ITConverstions [2], i found out about things like <i>spimes</i>, why the <i>'disembodied head of Alan Turing'</i> would be beaten by google and Thinklinks.<p>Thinklinks [3] allow you to locate physical things by a unique id on the Internet. The creator of Thinglinks is none other than Ulla-Maaria Mutanen [4], the other half of Jaiku creator, Jyri Engestrom [5].<p>What I've tried to demonstrate is the connected nature of communities. Any service that tries to harness their power of connections can be just as easily burnt. This episode shows demonstrates to me there is less loyalty to services than the social network you inhabit.<p>ps: news.yc can't handle unicode.<p>Reference<p>[0] Jaiku, Helsinki based , shared presence startup, 'About'<p><a href=""http://jaiku.com/about"">http://jaiku.com/about</a><p>[1] Wired, Bruce Strirling blog, 'beyond the beyond'<p><a href=""http://blog.wired.com/sterling/"">http://blog.wired.com/sterling/</a><p>[2] ITConversations, 'Bruce Stirling, The Internet of Things, 58m, 26.4 mb, 2006MAR06'<p><a href=""http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail717.html"">http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail717.html</a><p>[3] Thinklink, 'locate physical things by computers.

Use ""I"" when talking about yourself or yourself on behalf of the entity.<p>The same should be said for 2 or 3 person teams. Try to get in the habit of thinking about the company as an entity bigger than yourself.",1176079721

Apparently (as you already know) Google's employee intellectual property agreements say that they have the rights to anything developed while employed by Google.

They are a little more expensive, but they handle all the os-level patching, backup, etc. We basically just worry about the application. It lets us focus on the aspects of the business we are best suited to handle, and leave the os-level management to people that devote a lot more resources.",1176079369

10581,comment,10249,10249,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"I found mine through past work experience.  <p>I approached two of the smartest hackers I had worked with, and showed them a very brief Keynote presentation followed by a demo of the concept I had been working on part time over the last 6 months. <p>The Y-combinator application process prompted me to expedite my search for other founders.  I was originally planning on launching v.1 of the app before approaching them.\n \nTake-aways from this:<p><i>It is tempting to get a co-founder quickly, if only to validate your idea.  That's fine, but don't approach potentials just because you believe there is a high chance of them accepting.  Always try to bring in the best people you know.  <p></i>Know that you can work well together. Often said, but it's still worth repeating.<p><i>Presentations are great, but it's easier to convince someone to spend their time on an idea when you back your presentation up with a demo.  Regardless of the outcome, you'll receive valuable feedback, and it's probably good practice for when you meet VCs.\n",1176078267

Or do you suppose their motivation is to bring happiness to people?  Morals and money dont really mix very well.

I do agree that the concepts on which they were built have died - this is probably what the author of this article really means. The body is dead but rigor mortis has not yet set in.<p>Im not sure I would agree with this Web 2.0 business. To me the web is a very vacuous place - all sizzle and no steak. Its mainly a playground for the porn industry and identity thieves, and Microsoft wannabees desperately trying to convince people something great is about to happen there. So far nothing great has.<p>In many ways the web is like present day hollywood with its boom-vrash flash-bang movies. Full of sound and fury, but signifying nothing. All sight and sound but no plot and nothing for the intellect.<p>The web is a wild west arizona desert - full of snake oil salesmen - its just the bandwidth is higher.\n",1176078005

10573,comment,10502,10502,0,0,zaidf,,,"That's a rotten business that has to use bots to make the site look busy. After a while you will start believing that those bots are actually users and think your site is being used by 1000s of people - until reality hits you some sunny day. Instead invest that time in getting users. It's not easy - but neither is it THAT hard! <p>At least when you catch some sort of fire and start getting a decent stream of traffic, it will be something you can be proud of and build on. <p>About dating sites using bots - states are now enacting laws to regulate that.

I'd give up, say 10-20% of the value of the contract to pay for such services.  If the owner wants to take much more than that then he/she will have to expect people to jump ship after training.  The salary difference is worth taking on these other responsibilities yourself or finding an agency that will take less.<p>As far as your second example of people, I don't think enough people are like that to warrant consideration.  People are more likely to stay with a company beyond the point of rationality.",1329717543

3611463,comment,3611053,3611217,2,0,adharmad,,,"That's one of the surprises in NFL. If you read Gregg Easterbrook (Tuesday morning quarterback on espn), he frequently points out stastically obvious plays that coaches should have called, but they dont! It is hard to believe that NFL head coaches with their large entourage of assistant coaches do not have the same information that a writer on espn has!<p>The NFL actually boils down to players making plays. There is no rocket science involved (although coaches are regularly hailed as ""geniuses""). If the playbook is made too complicated, players will have a hard time learning it. The trick (in my opinion) is to have your players accurately anticipate the opposition's moves. Belichick's playbook is not the most complex, but it definitely geared towards exploiting his opposition's weaknesses, and simple enough to be understood/implemented by the players on field.",1329716954

It is very rare to find people who  are very good (or even equally good) at both.  They are entirely different design disciplines aimed at very different problems.  What non-relational db's do is they free the developer up from this second, very different discipine using tools that usually perform very well for standard OO operations.<p>That's a powerful thing.<p>Of course it's also powerful to have a math engine which can take your stored data, digest it, and spit out a report based on criteria you hadn't thought of until 30 seconds ago.

Don't recall the comment. But you're right, there's a difference between ""my child, butt out"" and ""you haven't birthed a child, butt out"". The former can definitely be done by any parent. In practice, the latter is exclusive to mothers. And I can somewhat relate to the former  people can be too nosy with other people's kids. So that doesn't seem to bother me as much, as long as they aren't endangering the child. But the latter is really arrogant and dismissive. Furthermore, it perpetuates the idea that child care is the mother's job. If we want to address the issue of women being underrepresented in the workplace, we have to get away from that ""Daddy works, Mommy is a mommy"" vestigial 1950's attitude. Male dominated workforces need to be friendly and more welcoming to women, and at the same time female dominated parental arrangements need to be more friendly and accommodating of other caregivers.<p>> However, I don't believe it had any place in a public twitter feed that also contains technical-related stuff and therefore may get followed by people who don't know you personally.<p>I don't want to play a persona on my Twitter account.

Eating too much of the <i>wrong things</i> is the issue.<p>2 - Unhealthy foods are cheaper than fresh fruits, veggies, and meat by an almost comically large margin. This is due to a number of causes, most saliently massive government subsidization of unhealthy food industries.<p>3 - Time is the scarcest resource, and the poor have the least of it, and the least to spare towards maintaining a healthy lifestyle (which, despite what you might insist, <i>is</i> a time-intensive activity).<p>3a - The poor are disadvantaged in choice of living space. My commute is an order of magnitude shorter than what it'd be from the nearest poor suburb. I pay for the privilege, and it earns me <i>easily</i> an extra 1.5h each day.<p>3b - The poor are disadvantaged in transportation. While most people simply hop on a car between A and B, the American poor spend an enormous amount of time navigating the clusterfuck that is North American public transit. Here in SF, even with its good-by-American-standards transit system, transit anywhere takes about twice as long as it does in car.<p>3c - The poor are disadvantaged in just sheer <i>lifestyle</i>. You might live next to a nice park where you can jog after work - what do the poor have except crime-ridden streets?<p>This is the thing I can't stand about this line of argument, not only does your position fail to account for the many, many ways the cards have <i>already</i> been stacked against the poor, but it also fails to appreciate just how many natural advantages you and I enjoy in every day life. It's a combination that really irks me: the failure to appreciate one's own good fortune, and conversely the willingness to blame others for not having such good fortune.<p>Side note: time really is the deciding factor in just about anything poverty-related. Part of the reason for the persistence of homelessness (disregarding even bigger fish like mental health and substance abuse) is that the homeless spend the majority of their day queuing for resources. They spend hours lining up for a meal. They spend even more hours lining up for a bed. 98% of their waking hours is spent ensuring the status quo (i.e., homeless, but unlikely to die tonight), with nothing left to make actual, lasting improvements. This same problem applies to the poor and dietary habits.",1329715535

I figure at the end of the day it would come down to the human aspect of it: can the team execute their high-probability play vs. the expected high-probability defense?<p>I wonder what kind of race this would lead to in F1?  If drivers were replaced by an apparatus that would drive the car and maximum driver assists and all telemetry measurements were allowed to be used would the races be boring or even more exciting?",1329714030

This means they would need to replace my GPS receivers (a car navigation unit, a boat navigation unit, three cell phones, and an iPad).  A quick mental summation is about $2,500, and that is pretty cheap compared to a <i>lot</i> of people out there.",1329714028

I am reminded about how high heels were worn by men in the past and the preferred colors for boys and girls (pink and blue) were switched.

For example, in the former USSR, 58% of engineers were women. In China, 40% of engineers are women, where less than 47% of the population are women. The communist countries placed a greater emphasis on gender equality in workforce. Sharp differences between west and the east are evident in other occupations such as medicine.<p>In the study cited, the mean age of the babies (neonates) was 3 days. That&#x27;s enough time for babies to be influenced by adult interactions. Babies have been shown to be handled differently by adults based on their gender. Female babies are spoken to more, whereas male babies are handled more.<p>In the study, a substantial number of babies exhibited behaviors associated with the other gender. I would resist talking about a real sexual dimorphism when gender is not determinative of social vs mechanical preference.",1436288281

The war on drugs on one hand and hysteria about terrorism on the other have done a great deal to make it risky to do home life science work. Beyond that regulation makes it hard to impossible to do near anything useful with animal tissues on a garage hacking basis, and if you&#x27;re not improving the state of medicine, what&#x27;s the point, really?

9846604,comment,9843373,9844399,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"Today&#x27;s internet supports multicast, unicast, anycast, broadcast, and geocast addressing. IP is a connectionless protocol designed to facilitate communication from one network node to another. The protocol is designed to be routed through dynamic, unreliable networks. IP is really not that challenging and there&#x27;s a lot of other layers that make its job easier.<p>And it really has <i>nothing</i> to do with centralization or decentralization. It&#x27;s peer to peer. Your peers can be anywhere and you can send and receive anything, out of order, connectionless. This is fantastic for decentralized distributed networking.<p>Applications can &#x27;assume&#x27; anything they want; that&#x27;s the <i>application</i>, not the addressing protocol. Everyone who has read RFC1918 knows IP addresses are not unique.<p>And there is no way to ensure a route doesn&#x27;t have a malicious actor. It&#x27;s been shown time and again with networks like Tor that it doesn&#x27;t matter what layers of security or obfuscation or decentralization you add. A bad actor on a route will be able to identify or mess with your traffic. Your application is the deciding factor in the security of the connection.<p>DNS and IP are not handled for everyone by a central authority. Both are independent protocols which can be used across the internet without a central authority&#x27;s authorization. Of course IP addresses are more closely guarded, but like you mentioned before, advertising an invalid range of addresses works all the time. And DNS is not even needed to use the internet! Public domain registration using specific TLDs does have centralized control bodies, of course, but that&#x27;s necessary to prevent conflict.<p>The internet is a web of trust. That will never, ever change. The reason it will never change is we all want something for free.<p>If you wanted, you could pay for and bury fiber-optic cable from your home to every place on planet earth that you want to make a network connection to. Then you wouldn&#x27;t have to trust anyone, and when someone taps into your fiber or cuts the connection, you could (hopefully) determine that your connection is no longer &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot;. But this is not very practical.<p>The internet fixes this by allowing any network to help any other network get around common network problems. We help each other because it is mutually beneficial. When that mutual assistance breaks down you get problems like the Comcast-Netflix debacle. No internet protocol or addressing scheme will route around a monopoly on the network. The only &quot;decentralized&quot; solution is a bunch of people on a wireless mesh network and a satellite link, which will still result in Netflix not being practically usable.<p>But please, keep believing that an addressing scheme will somehow keep you from having to trust a foreign network. Good luck getting House of Cards to stream.",1436288110

Biology usually doesn&#x27;t work. Even the simplest wet-lab reactions take very exacting conditions to work. This requires precise, expensive, equipment and endless optimization of protocols. The result is a tremendous drain on resources to get what usually amounts to a negative result<p>2. Bio is inherently perishable. You can&#x27;t let a start-up project linger as you chip away at it for 3 years. Reagents expire, lab-cultures will mutate, equipment rusts/breakdowns/gets contaminated for stupid unforeseeable reasons.<p>3. There is a stupidly large legal burden if you ever want to commercialize. At every step of the process the USDA, EPA, FDA, and patent office have rules and regulations to slow you down. It might take decades to take a product from the lab to the store self, if it gets there at all.<p>Bio isn&#x27;t computing.

The reason there was a problem in the first place that there were too many requests in flight and the system hit a meta-stable state where no requests could complete efficiently.<p>2) (or instead of (1)): If you&#x27;re going to have a worker pool, why have that complicated chan-chan-Job business? It seems that `func StartProcessor` was close to being a viable solution. All you need is to start a few of those in parallel, each reading from the same `Queue`.

I am comfortable--not gleeful, but comfortable--with not &quot;accepting&quot; them when that acceptance is what they need to harm people.

9846491,comment,9844380,9845003,0,0,aaronem,,,"> It can blink LEDs as well of course over GPIO but my impression is that this is a bit more complicated and requires extra hardware<p>Not really; all you need is an LED and some way of connecting it to pins on the J8 header. On the software side, working with GPIO (at least in Raspbian) is as easy as I&#x27;ve ever seen any implementation make it; with a couple of commands, you can expose an arbitrary set of GPIO pins as sysfs virtual files. From there, you can drive them with any scripting language, including shell, or even directly at the CLI with &quot;echo&quot; and &quot;cat&quot;.<p>This is what makes the Pi such an excellent platform for prototyping hardware to be implemented later on a smaller, more fit-for-purpose MCU: the &quot;time to first blinkenlight&quot; is extremely short, and iteration from there to standalone finished device can be quite granular.<p>To pick a handy example off my breadboard, here&#x27;s how you might take a four-digit seven-segment LED display (like a digital clock display), salvaged from a dead NordicTrack treadmill, through that process:<p>1. Identify LED display pins through experiment
-- The display turns out to be a rather typical common-cathode 4-digit display, with a partial 5th &quot;digit&quot; controlling the colon and decimals).<p>2. Wire up the LED display to the Pi&#x27;s J8 header, so that it can be driven by GPIOs
-- My breadboard [1] has a Pi bolted to it and interfaced via a homemade breakout, but you really don&#x27;t have to get that fancy; a pack of female-to-female jumpers [2] will amply suffice.<p>3. Expose the connected GPIOs via sysfs [3]
-- Once done, you can control them via shell scripts if you want, and many do.<p>4. Hack up a quick prototype in a scripting language, using the sysfs interface to control the connected device
-- In this project&#x27;s case, I found that, since the LED is common-cathode and has to be scanned in order to show different values on each digit, Perl + sysfs was too slow for proper flicker-free display.<p>5. Translate the prototype script into a proof-of-concept C program using a native library rather than the sysfs interface to drive the GPIOs
-- I use Mike McCauley&#x27;s lbcm2835 [4]; there are other options, which probably work just as well, but I found this one to best combine light weight (i.e. WiringPi wants to install binaries in my $PATH by default, and I don&#x27;t want that) and comprehensive exposure of the chip&#x27;s features.<p>6. Translate the C proof of concept into an equivalent implementation running on a microcontroller
-- When I get around to that step, I&#x27;ll be doing it on an MSP430, via the TI Launchpad which you can see below the Pi in the breadboard photo. Once I have a reliable clock driver running on the MCU, it&#x27;ll be time for the next step:<p>7. Modify the MCU firmware so that, instead of generating a clock display, it listens for commands via I2C and renders the received values on the LCD display
-- The BCM2835 can do I2C in hardware, and the Pi exposes it on J8. That&#x27;ll make this task a lot easier; instead of having to bit-bang I2C on GPIO pins, I can use the hardware functionality (exposed by lbcm2835) and concentrate on the MCU-side client implementation.
-- This&#x27;ll also free up a lot of GPIO pins on my Pi!<p>8. Move the finished design from breadboard to PCB
-- I&#x27;ll probably just solder this up on protoboard instead of having a proper PCB made, because one step remains:<p>9. Write MSP430 firmware that uses Mecrimus-B [5] to expose a USB device interface for receiving commands from a USB host, and acts as an I2C master to drive the LED display
-- The MSP doesn&#x27;t have a lot of firmware space, and Mecrimus-B takes up quite a bit of it; also, it&#x27;s written in assembly, not C. Instead of trying to intertwine the LED display driver with the USB stack, it&#x27;ll be easier just to run the USB stack on on MSP and the LED driver on another, interfaced via I2C, and MSP430s are cheap enough at ~$2.50/ea that using two instead of one doesn&#x27;t drive the BOM up significantly for a one-off project.<p>As you can see, the Pi&#x27;s hardware, and the library support available for it, results in a reasonably smooth effort-and-difficulty gradient throughout the process. More to the point, almost every step produces an immediately usable artifact, which is great for a self-paced teaching project, both to maintain motivation and to allow for auto-titration to level of interest.<p>If I&#x27;m reading the Micro:Bit right, it provides something similar, but with an even shorter &quot;time to first blinkenlight&quot; -- instead of needing a basic understanding of the Unix shell and the nous to wire up an LED, you just plug the Micro:Bit (and its onboard LED matrix) into a computer, load up the web IDE, and you&#x27;re off and scampering.<p>[1] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/SFTdBMt.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/SFTdBMt.jpg</a>

And today the Constitution is more often than not seen as quaint.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re right; maybe the percentage of Americans who see the Constitution as outdated and irrelevant has remained steady over time.  I don&#x27;t have polling data.  But from my personal experience, even in my lifetime, the marginalization of arguments based on the constitutionality of laws appears to have grown.  It now seems that bringing up the Constitution as a roadblock to new lawmaking is considered a tired, predictable, and ultimately weak talking point in a debate.",1436286757

I look forward to replace it with something integrated in the Linux kernel (e.g overlayfs).<p>Snapraid is responsible for the redundancy. It kind of implements an offline RAID5 scenario per file —instead of per disk block—, it only maintains a parity disk. Of course since it is offline, you have to update the parity every time you change a file. Usually once per day or per week is ok for long term storage. This approach offers many advantages. Every data disk just works everywhere since it has a common filesystem in it. Via parity data you can undelete files, find duplicate files and correct read errors. You won&#x27;t lose all drives if you lose more than parity+1 drives. It allows scrubbing and rebuilding.",1436286657

Run echo or some other noop if you need to.<p>(2) This is similar to how git operates.  You wouldn&#x27;t want to examine your git commits interactively (assuming that means the ability to change them in place) well, if you did, git has --amend, but no such thing exists in Docker.<p>An image with a given id is supposed to be permanent and unchanging, containers change and can be re-committed, but images don&#x27;t change.  They just have children.<p>It can get hairy when you reach the image layer limit, because using up the last allowed image layer means you can&#x27;t deploy to a container anymore.  So, how do you export the image?  &#x27;docker save&#x27; -- but &#x27;docker save&#x27; exports the image and all of its parent layers separately.

My only addition would be that there&#x27;s probably as much deviation within the genders as between them. But that doesn&#x27;t make gender a meaningless thing.  The frequency of those aspects is important too. Only, say, 10% of women are &quot;butch&quot; personality types but 90% of men are. So holding up a butch woman as an example and going &quot;See, see gender is meaningless&quot; is unconvincing.<p>I think eventually society will sober up and realize that when we talk about social aspects, more than likely we&#x27;re talking about personal types. Certain ones simply exist with higher frequency per gender.<p>I feel like we&#x27;re on this long path of migrating away from &quot;default brain&quot; assumptions made about race, nationality, gender, etc and will probably settle on something like the modern day understanding of personiality types.

Nearly 80% of that goes to the driver!  The premise of driverless cars leading to massive rides-for-hire is that driverless cars could massively reduce that cost -- probably from $10 - $20ish to $5 - $10ish.<p>So just there -- is ride-sharing really going to save $3?  Presumably not for a $5 ride.  Not for a $6 ride either.  A $7 ride?  Maybe!  But if so Uber is sure as hell not getting a lot for driving ride-sharing.<p>Okay, so let&#x27;s say that a driverless car would ordinarily cost you $10 per ride, and you can reduce it to $7 by sharing.  First of all, note that this reduces the value of the service for you -- even if you have no safety concerns, it takes longer.  Then add in the non-safety awkwardness thing.  It&#x27;s pretty close quarters for a relatively long ride.  What if the other person is just socially awkward?<p>And then imagine if you will that it&#x27;s someone that you feel -- rightly or wrongly -- is genuinely threatening.  And you&#x27;re cooped up in a Toyota Camry for 15 minutes with this person and absolutely no one to run interference for you.<p>For $3?<p>Also:  if getting a driverless Uber costs $10, you should at least contemplate owning your own driverless car.  $10 at current business write-off rates is about 18 miles.  It sounds like in this hypothetical Uber isn&#x27;t a great deal.  You could realize most or all of your cost-savings by owning your own driverless car, and as a bonus you won&#x27;t have to share your car with a stranger, and as a further bonus you won&#x27;t get gouged at high demand times.",1436285334

Uncompressing took about 10 seconds. The uncompressed file was identical to the original file.<p>Occam&#x27;s razor: the &quot;compressed&quot; version was a link (shortcut, symlink, hyperlink, whatever) to the original.<p>> Despite maintaining a healthy skepticism, I have two reasons for believing the files were identical. First, Saldana played the uncompressed video on the Windows laptop. The uncompressed video looked exactly like the original video. That was nice, but it didn&#x27;t prove anything. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to identify an unfaithful video copy if it bit me on the nose.<p>> The second proof that the original and compressed files were identical was much more compelling. Saldana put the uncompressed file on my own USB drive. Later that day, on my own computer, I ran the uncompressed and compressed files through a bit-by-bit comparison program. Sure enough, the two files contain the exact same sequence of 0s and 1s.<p>> It should be noted that for security reasons, Saldana didn&#x27;t copy the 4 KB compressed file to my USB drive, so I don&#x27;t know what bit sequence was inside the 99.78% compressed file.<p>All of this is consistent with the file being a link.<p>A more thorough test would have performed the compression and decompression on two different, non-networked machines, so that the only information available to the decompressor is the 4K file.<p>After that, we need to start removing layers which can be used to obscure the results, eg. performing a more low-level analysis of the compressed version, using machines which the authors have no access to (eg. to avoid a hacked OS/driver which reports false file sizes)",1436285168

If you need those, only with special hard-to-get permits, or you need to join the army (and kill few poor people for free)<p>if you want to stop some crazy people killing with these &quot;assault guns&quot; (why not called home defense guns?), you should focus on removing given dangerous individual from society, and not trying remove their access to weapons. Anything can be used to kill, including scissors, saw, pipe, baseball, knife or just good old pure hands. with current logic, all these things should get outlawed too.
No statistics in hand, but I am damn sure the amount of people killed by legally purchased &quot;assault rifles&quot; compared to say hit & run with cars is neglible. with similar logic I say ban cars!  (and it would do so much good in other ways...)<p>P.S. one last thing - pro-gun-ban people completely disregard gun shooting as a means for hunting and as a fun activity at range. Many weapons, including mentioned AR-15 (civilian version of popular M16) will never be shot outside shooting range. Why use higher caliber guns instead of some puny .22? Because it&#x27;s more fun!<p>Ah wait, we&#x27;re talking maybe to same people that banned almost harmless marihuana and happily kept tobacco and alcohol roaming free on markets...<p>DISCLAIMER: I never owned any handgun that would require any form of registration, yet before having strong statements about what should/shouldn&#x27;t be banned, I at least educate myself. Gun ban laws are, apart for some corner cases, just pure crowd idiocy and hypocrisy.",1436285072

9846266,comment,9845038,9846136,0,0,rpcope1,,,"> While the Headroom hack was childish as well, it was also completely absurdist and didn&#x27;t promote anything. I think its rare to see something like this where the hackers aren&#x27;t pushing some agenda or self-promoting. From an aesthetic perspective it was pretty impressive. It really sells the idea of being creepy and mysterious.<p>I agree, I got to thinking about it and there really isn&#x27;t anything in the way of &quot;hacks&quot; anymore that isn&#x27;t pushing an (often absurd) agenda (like &quot;Anonymous&quot;). It&#x27;s sort of a shame that everyone has to push an agenda, but I guess that&#x27;s nothing new. There was really a cool aura to the Max Headroom broadcast that you don&#x27;t ever really see in other &quot;hacks.&quot;<p>That being said, I think it would be cool to have a HackThisSignal (maybe like HackThisSite?) where you might encourage people to pull off more things like the Max Headroom intrusion in a more controlled manner. It kind of ruins a little bit of the aesthetic, not being totally unexpected, but I think it would be a cool way to show off this sort of gag and learn more about Microwave/RF systems without necessarily being on the wrong side of the law.",1436285046

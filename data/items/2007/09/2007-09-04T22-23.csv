50224,comment,50154,50159,0,0,randallsquared,,,"HTML is object code only because you don't have a dedicated designer who wants to make design decisions and changes without requiring the programmer's time.  For news.yc that's fine, but for many business sites, having HTML automatically generated in a designer-opaque manner is inconvenient.  Eventually you want to hand off the design to someone who is good at design, and having to find someone good at design and good at the programming language you use limits the pool of designers.<p>The usual alternative to html-as-object-code is to use a template system, but template systems seem to move as a group (and individually during development) toward being a way to write your usual language, but surrounded by HTML, which has the same problems I outline above, since the designer still has to mess with what's really application code.  I suppose this is because template systems are usually designed by programmers, for programmers.<p>",1188945785

I'm wrong.<p>It turns out there's no standard for this, so who knows what you can do today.  But practically, Google Web Accelerator doesn't prefetch links with a query string, at least currently.  So Paul's voting links are A-OK with GWA.  And that's the only one that you need to worry about, at least today.",1188945631
50222,comment,50154,50182,0,0,zach,,,"Using some form of ""web accelerator"" is asking for trouble.  I consider Paul's method better than requiring Javascript to vote or making the voting links some wacky kind of button element.<p>If HTML had a method=""post"" option on <a>'s then it would be no problem to always use the proper HTTP verb, but we have to satisfice with what we've got.",1188945466

Standards compliance?  What's that?  <p>A lot of deprecated methods are still used because they work reliably, whereas the replacement often didn't, until much, much later.  People remember the pain and bugginess and so you lose the early adopters even if the problems eventually get fixed.  Cf. Apple III, g++, MySQL.<p>",1188945091

To count oneself as an atheist one need not claim to have a proof that no gods exist. One need merely think that the evidence on the god question is in about the same state as the evidence on the werewolf question.</i><p>Hopefully this will outrage lots of founders so they will refuse to use Lisp, thus giving me another competitive advantage.<p>I would like to take this opportunity to recommend C#, PHP, and ASP.NET to my prospective competition.

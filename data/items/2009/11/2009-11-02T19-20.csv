I found that when I tried harder to make the stories cohesive and storybook-like she just got bored and demanded a different plot line or character.  She seems to enjoy them much more when I throw in random things like race cars made out of fruit or old men jumping over houses to get to their breakfast.

In fact, a lot of the people I know that have stayed fit for years have used calorie counting as part of their tool-set.  The author of the book linked in my above comment is one of those people.  However, that's just my experience.<p>Like the author of the original author stated, counting calories is used more as an educational tool than a micro-management tool.  It helps people understand their own personal energy (im)balance.  That may well be the crux of your point though.<p>I find it interesting that the research indicates something doesn't work that I have seen work with much success.

Now, they don't use ECC ram (and I fail to understand why he doesn't throw in 2GiB ram rather than one;  if he put int 2GiB, he'd be competitive with my 2GiB VPSs.)  and they are slow, cheap hardware, but speaking as someone who sells VPSs for a living, for some things, having a box to yourself is much better than a vps, even if the cost per performance is higher.<p>Now, my experience with the atoms (and why I'm not selling 'em)  is that they use more power than you expect;  50w each or so, down from 75w each for a core2duo with 8GiB ram.  So I'm guessing this person is also in a region where power is cheaper than it is for me.  (I am in the SF bay area, and thus I pay enough for power that margins on a power-hungry atom system would be rather small.)<p>You can get the operations overhead per machine down with a good pxeboot/automated provisioning system.  some larger places I've worked, provisioning 5,000  machines was a relaxed afternoon of work.  Yeah, physical servers are a bit more work than virtuals, but they don't have to be that much more work, if you have a good system.<p>That said, getting a VPS on modern dual-socket 8 or 12 core boxes with ecc ram usually gives you more bang for your buck, if the security tradeoffs are worth it.",1257191522

All Apple demonstrates by this is that consumer feedback is not as much a part of their development process as most people seem to think (or hope) it is.<p>The problem is that not only is Apple saying ""we can't be bothered with this netbook thing right now"" but they are saying it with a middle finger, fully extended, at their customers.

And at the time it was so rare in the US that no one really understood it (and he died before there were non-destructive tests for it). It is a disease related to ""scrapie"" which cattle and sheep can get (he took care of the sheep that his daughters got 4H ribbons for showing in fairs).

When you're driving, you <i>feel</i> in control, versus when you're a passenger in an airplane, you have zero control over anything. That imbalance leads to why there are classes and shrinks to help get over the fear of flying, but there aren't any folks with fear of driving.<p>The vast majority of prion diseases come from our industrial agriculture. So if you're afraid, then you really need to avoid beef. The USDA <i>only</i> permits BSE testing on visibly symptomatic animals, and has banned 100% testing which many countries are only willing to accept. It takes 4-5 years for an infected animal to get the visible symptoms, and most cattle are slaughtered before they hit 2 years old. And the bush administration reduced the number of BSE inspectors by 90%. And you probably should avoid hunting as deer and elk can get a related illness called chronic wasting disease.<p>Finally, there were some genetic studies and it appears that if you have 2 copies of some gene, then you're suceptible to getting vCJD if exposed to the prions (and if you're going to get it, you'll get symptoms in 2-3 years after exposure).

The problem is that it's difficult to learn to do it on your own quickly: it really helps to take a class in interviewing.<p>Briefly:
Ask questions like ""have you ever had to do X?"" ""What problem did you encounter doing X?"" ""How did you solve it?"" ""What would you do in this (insert common job problem) situation?"" ""What were the people at your last job like?"" ""Did everyone go out for lunch, or eat at their desks?"" ""Which do you prefer?"" ""Why?"" ""What did you do for lunch yesterday?""
Learn to <i>listen</i> (this is the really hard part) and respond to the answers and drill down from there. For example, for each answer he gives you, think of three questions to ask to fully plumb it out.

2. The ""book"" is actually my class notes from the Customer Development class I teach at Haas.
3. Students started asking for hard copies of the notes.  I sat on the board of Cafepress so as a favor, I bundled the notes together, slapped a cover on it and put it on the cafepress.com site 
4. When Eric Ries took my class he pointed out that I could ship the copies to Amazon and that would give others broader access to it. Amazon wanted something more than ""these are my class notes"" as a description.
5. You can think of the book as a $39 ripoff for class notes, or a steep discount on the $30,000 Haas Business School tuition. 
6. The book title was a pun on my last company, Epiphany
7. The web site is a running commentary on the origin of customer development, how the ideas evolved and what they mean",1257189513

917619,comment,916491,917405,0,0,frig,,,"Thanks. I figured grammatical # as such would be discarded as unnecessary but the notion of plurality raises semantic issues that natural language sidesteps by ambiguity.<p>Disclaimer/Personal Background (trying to be brief): I've often been told I've got an unusual cognitive style (for lack of better term) and I've often felt very much as if there's an impedance mismatch between how my thoughts are structured and how language operates; in essence, at the word-or-sentence level everything I hear or read is very polyvalent and vague, and only take on a concrete meaning to me if I get multiple paraphrases of it...it's putting all the variants into superposition and seeing which parts reinforce or cancel shows me the contour of the actual meaning (which itself is not necessarily ever actually ""represented in words"" so much as ""gets the outline of its semantic boundaries painted"").<p>In the abstract this leaves me with an interest in the idea of something like lojban but very mixed initial reactions: it's possible an artificial language with more-precise meanings would eliminate my need for doing verbal interferometry across multiple paraphrases but on the other 
hand I have a lifetime's experience feeling very uncomfortable without tons of redundancy and repetition-with-alteration, which seems to be what lojban is trying to eliminate in its use.<p>Too much info, I'll stop there.<p>I do have two more questions if you have time.<p>#1 is historical: what's the process by which the core sets of things like spatial relationships or tenses or shapes or so on came to be enumerated?<p>EG: if I were doing a language in this form I'd go through all the languages I could get my hands on and try to get good lists of all their fundamental categories (eg: spatial prepositions and ""classifiers"", like you have in swahili and chinese (+ languages with heavy chinese contact) (cf: <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/pss/413103"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/pss/413103</a> ) and then try to factor them into semantic atoms. I'd consider this approach bottom-up (see what's out there, and then try and simplify and unify them) and contrast it with a more top-down approach (trying to derive a finite set of spatial relations ab initio via pure reasoning); it'd also be a good set of ""unit tests"" for your final set of core concepts, making sure that none of these words' senses are not really expressible in terms of your base concepts.<p>How did the lojbanists derive their tenses / spatiotemporal prepositions / etc.? Is there a good ""history of the design of lojban"" that speaks to this?<p>Question #2: at a practical level how would you decompose ""There are dogs in the kitchen"" into lojban?<p>If I had to break it into predicates it'd probably be the conjunction:<p>- CONTAINS(""containment-type T"",""kitchen"",""entity collection E"")<p>- T ~ whatever containment type you have that is ~ ""contains within its spatial bounds -- but not structurally -- for an indeterminate time period""<p>- COUNT(E) > 0<p>- ENTITY-COLLECTION-TYPE(E,X), where X ~ ""collection treated as collection due to spatiotemporal circumstance and descriptive convenience"" (EG: E is an entity collection b/c there are label(s) they all share, namely being instance-of dog and contained-in-the-kitchen in the same way; there's no assertion of any other source of entity-identity beyond the circumstances this utterance is describing; contrast to say ""baseball team"" or ""deck of cards"", etc., which are entity-collections with a more-persistent and ""intentional"" identity)<p>- forall e in E IS-INSTANCE-OF(""instance-of-type IoT"",e,""dog"")<p>- ""instance-of-type"" ~ whatever instance-of you have that is ~ ""is a concrete instantiation of an abstract type not otherwise specified (eg: an actual 'dog', not 'Pomeranian')<p>- + some temporal modifier to explain like ""the described circumstance started before I made this utterance and I do not think it has ceased, yet""<p>...but I'd assume some of the intended distinctions are usually left implicit or inferred; what's a good lojban decomposition?",1257189439

Hopefully the fact that you are likely intelligent and that you already know the odds are ridiculous at best that you would get a disease like this, yet you are still worrying about it tells you that you are thinking irrationally.<p>I think by realizing this you'll be one step up in the game.  I think the real crux of your problem is to somehow stop thinking irrationally.  Unfortunately this is where my advice ends because I am nothing but a logical thinker.  I think about death occasionally but only worry that I will die before I've done enough good in the world.<p>I think you are doing a good thing by seeking counseling and I think your main goal should be on trying to stop thinking irrationally.  Hopefully some of what i said calms you down at least a bit.<p>One last note - suicide will not only end your life but crush anyone else's life that you are a part of.  It is a weak, selfish thing to do.  I am a firm believer that people are put here to do good things in the world and if you drop yourself from the equation you're hurting the odds of getting a higher percentage of do-gooders out there.  If you care even slightly about your family or friends you will set aside suicide as a possible option and start looking at changing things for yourself.<p>Also, you may want to remove that from your post as you're likely going to make people think you're just trolling for emotional responses.  Since I feel like you may be trolling this will be my only post.<p>If you aren't trolling I sincerely wish you good luck with your burden and offer you my thoughts from a rational standpoint - I think you <i>can</i> beat what you're dealing with if you stick with it.",1257188431

In my experience, lack of abstraction (often due to not analyzing the issue at hand thoroughly) results in non-abstract, verbose, hard to understand and refactor code. It&#x27;s the difference between, say, building an SQL query by appending strings to a buffer (move one line and everything blows up) and building a model of your query (projection, etc...). Sure, the abstraction means more code, but it&#x27;s much more easier to manipulate and considerably less risk-prone. It won&#x27;t be faster than doing it the other way, but it won&#x27;t be necessarily measurably slower.",1399629552

This was originally due to the fact that only the bytecode backend supported dynamic loading (which is used by camlp4 to load the syntax extension modules).  When native dynamic code loading was added to OCaml circa 2009 or so, the build systems around camlp4 never really took up the change to switch to the much faster native code version.  All the ppx extensions emerging now are at least guaranteed to have a native code version on all the major supported architectures (x86, ARM, Sparc, PPC)",1399627770

He explains how NSA shills are reading reddit / HN and poisoning communities / standards / protocols / etc. How everything is made, on purpose, needlessly complex to prevent honest developers from working on important things.<p>He talks about shills submitting a few correct patches over the months / years, slowly gaining reputation among the community and then misusing that trust to submit (not so) subtle patches introducing security holes on purpose.<p>He mentions a few of the &quot;common mantra&quot; repeated often (including here) by people who have an interest in the status quo.<p>He explains why SSL/TLS is broken and says that the &quot;SEC&quot; part of &quot;DNSSEC&quot; is not going to be that secure ; )<p>I think that the problem is much worse than most people think and that Poul-Henning Kamp is closer to the truth than the ones constantly repeating &quot;bug happens&quot; as if nothing malicious was ever going on.",1397037579

SIMD code going on. An example of this in usage is [2].<p>That said you&#x27;re right, usually the best performance can only be obtained by using really specific instructions. But in my experience, a decent performance increase can be obtained by using the generic vector extensions.<p>Moreover, if you can use the vector extensions for a large part of the code, that means you have to write a lot less platform-specific stuff. I.e.: you increase portability anyway, since now you only have to rewrite 5 out of 20 functions instead of 20/20. Even better, they allow one to write v3 = v1 + v2 instead of v3 = _mm_add_ps(v1,v2). The first one being clearer, more portable (will generate appropriate addps or equivalent NEON, ...) and plain nicer to read.<p>Your pcmpeqd example is a good example of an optimizer flaw. In my opinion this is orthogonal to whether or not to expose a specific or generic API. The compiler should&#x27;ve use the most efficient instruction for that simple idiom, period (without you telling it to use pcmpeqd). If we continue your line of reasoning, we&#x27;re back to assembly for everything.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://vec.io/posts/gcc-and-clang-vector-extensions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vec.io/posts/gcc-and-clang-vector-extensions</a> (The vector extensions allow +,-,*,/,<,>,==,!= to be naturally used for SIMD types)\n[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/rikusalminen/threedee-simd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rikusalminen/threedee-simd</a>",1397037087

I think <i>everyone</i> should write their own GC, write a filesystem, and handle their own memory layer, at least once.<p>Treating lower levels of the stack as &quot;too complex, there be dragons, just write some Javascript that hits RESTful API for JSON&quot; is a great way to ensure you never progress as a software dev or an engineer.<p>I agree that reinventing the wheel poorly - without understanding geometry or physics - is a terrible idea.  But I also think that we don&#x27;t have enough people nowadays making toy wheels to <i>learn</i> about geometry and physics.<p>For each of the things you mentioned, there are concrete and good reasons why they grow complexity: filesystems need to be robust to media corruption and power faults; memory allocators need to be highly tuned to OS and architecture memory layouts; GCs need to be optimized for the code patterns of the particular language they serve, as well as understand the same OS and hardware memory constraints as allocators.<p>But much of the complexity of these layers is not <i>intrinsic</i> to the problem, and not related to the above.  In fact, most of the complexity and bugs of production code at these layers have to do with legacy compatibility, or code inheritance.  (If you look at what Theo says about this specific OpenSSL bug, it arises <i>because</i> the OpenSSL team wrote their own allocator that doesn&#x27;t use malloc() protection bits because those are not compatible across some platforms.)<p>As the old saying goes: in science, we advance by standing on each others&#x27; shoulders; in software, we stand on each others&#x27; toes.",1397035079
7558353,comment,7555426,7557493,3,0,Uncompetative,,,"I just needed a hobby to keep me from getting bored and depressed. I had adapted a screenplay and made plans to write a novel, but my interest in programming had been sparked by an early exposure to Super Star Trek and the profound realisation that this illusion was being created by a magical recipe.<p>I wanted to learn these arcane incantations so that I could fill this black void with my own Universe. Whether it be CRT, LCD, LED, or Plasma, I have been trying to find a way to bring worlds of light to the darkness of a computer display ever since. Yet, as the scale of my endeavour dawned on me I realised that it would be better to spend a couple of years creating tools that I was comfortable using than rely on C++ as others recommended.<p>Unfortunately, my estimate was out by an order of magnitude.<p>Some twenty years later I have only managed to wrangle the process of research and (re)design to a point where I am finally ready to write a comprehensive specification of my multiparadigm &quot;live&quot; programming language and its alternative document-centric graphical user interface only after a self-imposed deadline made at the beginning of last month - otherwise, I&#x27;m sure I would still be amusing myself exploring endless &quot;rabbit holes&quot;.<p>Despite this delay, I feel that my project is stronger as a result. I really didn&#x27;t know enough about computer science when I started and I have found that I need to grok OOP and FP to know that they aren&#x27;t appropriate for my needs. I was denied the opportunity to study the subject at school and had to travel to Foyle&#x27;s in London to buy obscure computer books for years before unlimited broadband became affordable. Admittedly, I was paranoid that I would find myself several years into programming my videogame only to discover that &quot;high productivity&quot;, &quot;spare me the details&quot;, programming language was weak in some respect and could not accomodate the retrofit of some unanticipated, but very necessary, feature. Hence, a lot of the work I have done has been defensive: trying  to create a future roadmap that specifies how concurrency and parallelism would work even if I plan to leave the implementation of these features until much later.<p>Hopefully, it won&#x27;t be too long before I am using an integrated suite of development tools (created with my own language), to build my own procedurally-generated intergalactic MMORTSFPSRPG (Massively-Multiplayer Real-Time Strategy First-Person Shooter Role-Playing Game), or &quot;adventure&quot; if you prefer. Without my language/tools I very much doubt I would be able to complete such a grandiose endeavour unaided, and I very much prefer working alone without social expectations or professional deadlines - despite how much of my disposable income it has cost.",1397035074

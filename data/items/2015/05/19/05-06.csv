9568259,comment,9565891,9568210,0,0,angersock,,,"Sure. Started out with some school projects that were beautiful object-oriented single-thread vistor-pattern for rendering in fixed-function OpenGL. This predictably led to terrible performance. At the end of school, friend and I decided to extract that code and try to build a real engine around it.<p>Upgraded to thread-safe rendering in OpenGL, one thread handling rendering and windowing tasks, other threads game logic and submitting draw requests, and ultimately other threads handling resource loading onto the GPU (though that came later towards the end).<p>Upgraded <i>that</i> to actually use the programmable pipeline, and finally added support for FBOs and uniforms and buffers and everything so we could actually start on deferred rendering as outlined in Engel&#x27;s blog and other places. Never did transparency, but if I remember correctly the goal was to  probably do something like screen-door+deferred. For the life of me I can&#x27;t remember the paper we were looking at.<p>Eventual goal was to do full deferred lighting and PBR, but by that point I&#x27;d moved over to web development. Every time I went back to that codebase, clean and organized as it was, it was just such a pain in the ass to do anything compared to splatting some JS and Three onto the screen and being done with it.<p>Concurrent with <i>that</i>, I was doing 3D CAD software development in Java with Ardor3D. So, big annoying retained-mode scenegraph with all the BVH nonsense you could ever want, and a bunch of legacy files for things that, when one rendered a building all at once, would kill the graphics card. And don&#x27;t even get me started on trying to sort out order-independent transparency for that...one of my great failures.<p>By contrast, nowadays I do multiple web workers with websockets to provide 30-60 fps display of waveform data on just bare 2D canvases, with Angular wrapping the components.<p>EDIT:<p>I&#x27;m aware of the scripting thing. Note that, until perhaps FarCry, it was pretty well held that scripting languages were &quot;too slow&quot; for most games, nevermind the success of such things as JIT Quake 1 bytecode, or the stuff in Out Of This World, or what have you. Even UnrealScript was considered godawful dog slow and to be avoided if possible, and was finally shown the door. But, in the end, scripting was discovered not to be the super worst thing ever.<p>I think Eve finally hammered that point home to everyone.<p>The scripting languages we have now have come a long way in terms of ease of embedding, with a possible exception for Lua, which has been easy as hell for a while now.<p>Then again, I don&#x27;t think that many scripting languages have the sheer size of interface with native code that, say, JS in the browser does.",1432013046

My wife has a credit card and occasionally uses it for online purchases, but what we use it for mostly is: rent (really!), and cell phone.<p>I was really surprised when we rented our flat lately that a credit card was necessary (possibly as a means to keep out foreigners like me who often don&#x27;t have access to credit cards...)  We could pay for the cell phone with cash, but it is easiest to get the initial contract if you have credit card.

The ResearchDownload utility looks like a clone of Mediatek&#x27;s SpFlashTool, and if the bootloader mode works in a similar fashion, dumping the full eMMC should also be possible like it is in MTK.

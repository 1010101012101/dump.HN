64053,story,,,2,4,NSX2,"Another EZ work-hack, same deal.",,"This is going to seem so simple, you might be quick to dismiss it as stupid.  But they teach it to fighter pilots, special forces teams and a small variation of this is taught in hospital emergency room triage training; in other words, situations where you have many variables, need to make a decision with imperfect information and your decision must lead to results ASAP.<p>It's called ""A.C.T.E. micro-cycling"" and is a practical real world application of skunkworks philosophy (keep messing up faster and more creatively until the solution reveals itself).<p>A. --> ASSESS the situaion rapidly.  Don't try to figure out everything.  Do something physical like walking or showering or laundry and let your ""subconcious"" spit out the situation IN A LIMITED TIME.  In other words, occupy your over-analytical left-side concious mind, and let your ""big picture"" right-side subconcious mind figure it out automatically under a tight deadline.  ""By the time I'm done showering and blowdrying my hair, whatever I figure the problem is, that's what it is.""  Numerous studies have shown that whatever your right-brain spits out quickly in a tight time-space while you're not ""actively thinking"" about the problem usually covers 70-90% of the most important issues no matter how much additional time you spend ""trying to figure it out"".  After that it's rapidly declining returns.  So analyze and come to an assessment, but do so using the powers of the part of your mind that knows the answer already while you get laundry done too :=)<p>C --> CREATE a >> simple << plan that can be immediately implemented and will bring feedback within hours at best, half-a-day or a day at most.  Not plans that need input from this guy and that guy but they're on vacation or its the weekend, just ""what can I do right now with what I have at hand to see what kind of results that approach gets me so I can make another quick plan based on almost immediate, continuous feedback?""<p>T --> TAKE ACTION!  (self-explanatory; see my other post on why ""micro-planning-acting"" cycles bypasses brain's built-in resistance to taking action and tendency to get lost in procrastination loops.)<p>E --> Evaluate the outcome of your actions and start another micro cycle - you can actually consider this part just another ""Assess"" or a ""re-assess.""<p>ASSESS with right brain, CREATE a super-simple immediately doable plan that gets instant feedback, TAKE immediate action without concern for perfect resources, etc.  EVALUATE the outcome of your microcycle with whatever changes your ""A.C.T."" made to the environment and adjust accordingly.<p>No point in trying to optimize either the assess, the create plan or the action part.  The emphasis is on the speed in completing the cycle and the continuousness of one cycle to the next - ie, 4 of these micro-cycles done over 1 weekend will give you more valuable insights than a month's worth of perfect planning and getting together the perfect people/resources/etc.<p>But I'm sure some of you people already know this.<p>As a professor of mine used to say, ""Sometimes efficiency is inefficient"" (sometimes getting the system to become efficient takes so many resources and time and effort that it drains the energy needed to actually apply and get results from the system, so a ""simple, messy, quick"" method actually works more effectively than and efficient system.<p>Again (if you found this useful and wish to offer something of value in exchange): I am in New York City area. I want to do a startup like the rest of you. I am not a ""haxor"" ... but my background is in its own way completely relevant to what I want to do. Technically the idea is more of a ""different use of mostly already existing technology/platforms"" not a ""radically new technology"" thing, and from my research most of the stuff / functions can be found in open-source applications.<p>Nonetheless I need some techies. Connections would be appreciated. Or insights into your minds: HOW DO YOU FOLKS LIKE TO BE APPROACHED? WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO YOU IN A STARTUP? Hours? Freedom? Dress code? Impact on the world at large and the resulting improvement in quality of life for humanity? Adrenaline rush of doing something clever and sneaky that will take people by surprise? A philosophical cause? Doing the right thing? Making the world a better place? A solid business model? Endless supply of Red Bull? Xbox 360s in the break room? Bean-bag chairs? Free beer for late night programming sessions?<p>Seriously, I have read past posts where people without programming backgrounds post ""looking for programmers"" type of posts that seem to get at best ignored or at worst trashed; how can I bypass this seemingly built-in reluctance of programmers to work with people unlike yourselves technically, but like yourselves in other ways and with different skill sets that would complement your own for a more balanced whole? If you click my profile there's an email if you wish to contact me directly.<p>Thanks in advance! \n",1191682698

Comparing Computer Science to ""Pen Science"" (which is presumably the study of pens) simply demonstrates a lack of understanding of what Computer Science is.",1191682394
64051,comment,63978,63978,0,0,greendestiny,,,"It seems to be the big question of the internet at the moment doesn't it... is facebook worth that much, or really anything?<p>Firstly I think anytime there is a whole bunch of people communicating you should never ask yourself what the point is. Communication is a fundamental, it <i>is</i> the reason. <p>Second there's the big draw cards of social networks - an easy lightweight way to connect and reconnect. Its a great big people directory - and connections are very low social risk - much easier than emailing that person you haven't seen in years. And how are you going to get their email address anyway, any public directory would be spam central.<p>Of course myspace or any site has that much going for it. So that leaves the final facebook draw card - facebook apps. I totally understand the skepticism, but apps offer lots of different shared activities. Lots of little quizzes and games, very much like the kind of structured getting-to-know-you party game type activities. Its actually very difficult for these kinds of applications to exist without incorporating the friend networks that facebook offers. <p>Its a platform that allows a kind of lightweight, asynchronous and with easy opt-outs and opt-ins, shared online experience. I think it actually threatens to become the internet for a lot of people. ",1191682329

One of the most surprising things we've learned is how little it matters where people went to college.<p>I thought I'd already been cured of caring about that. There's nothing like going to grad school at Harvard to cure you of any illusions you might have about the average Harvard undergrad. And yet Y Combinator showed us we were still overestimating people who'd been to elite colleges. We'd interview people from MIT or Harvard or Stanford and sometimes find ourselves thinking: they must be smarter than they seem. It took us a few iterations to learn to trust our senses.<p>Practically everyone thinks that someone who went to MIT or Harvard or Stanford must be smart. Even people who hate you for it believe it.<p>But when you think about what it means to have gone to an elite college, how could this be true? We're talking about a decision made by admissions officers--basically, HR people--based on a cursory examination of a huge pile of depressingly similar applications submitted by seventeen year olds. And what do they have to go on? An easily gamed standardized test; a short essay telling you what the kid thinks you want to hear; an interview with a random alum; a high school record that's largely an index of obedience. Who would rely on such a test?""<p>college = 0",1191679509

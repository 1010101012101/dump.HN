It encourages you to make sure every answer is correct before submitting it, otherwise you would have to start over again.<p>That's not the point. You can learn to solve ten math problems in a row by simply memorizing algorithms to solve the problems, rather than learning the underlying concepts. The author criticizes Khan Academy because its methods emphasize the algorithms, rather than the concepts.<p>There's a good bit of research suggesting that the ability to solve quantitative problems isn't necessarily related to underlying qualitative understanding. Students could benefit from teaching methods designed to promote understanding.",1328471993

3555034,comment,3554719,3554719,32,0,swishercutter,,,"Where Khan Academy has the distinct advantage to me is not in its content or teaching style (both of which seem good) but in the ability for the student who does not grasp the subject to be able to replay the lesson over and over without fear of holding up the class or causing the teacher inconvenience thereby allowing the students who do understand the ability to move on to the next subject without having to ""read ahead"".  The overall content covered can be greater overall in a shorter amount of time.<p>Kids don't want to seem different from other kids.  If a child has to ask the teacher to repeat the lesson or stay after for extra help he may be perceived by his peers (or feel as though he is being seen as) as slower or stupid.  With KA on the other hand the student can learn at his own pace...something that just cannot be done in a class of 30+.<p>Khan Academy does not get upset if a student does a search and finds another method to solve the problem at hand (I don't know how many times I was told ""I don't care if you are getting the right answer, we want you to do it our way"" when I was in school).<p>To me it is not about KA at all...but more about self education.  The best teacher is you, the lecturer may be giving you the information but how you perceive and use it is entirely based on you.  It is a simple fact that teachers cannot at the same time be paid more and have smaller class sizes...the funding is not there.  Students are going to fall behind unless they are taught early on to not rely entirely on the teacher to show them ""everything"".  We have at our disposal the most powerful learning tool in the history of man...The internet.  No longer are libraries bound to the confines of a building down the road that you may or may not have access to.  This is the most amazing thing to me, decentralization of learning, and those who profit from learning in the old system obviously are going to be worried about their future income.",1328471924

3555031,comment,3554719,3554719,3,0,davesims,,,"My feeling after reading the article is that he's link-baiting to make a valid point about trends in education in general. He gets demerits for the misdirection, but his fundamental question is essential and needs to be engaged.<p>Is he correct that education is fundamentally a human, not technological, endeavor? Is something essential lost when teaching is made completely abstract by software and engineering?<p>I say this as a home-schooling father of five that uses a lot of technology -- DVDs, online -- to augment our curriculum, and couldn't be happier that I'll be able to have my kids go through MIT, Stanford, Khan, etc., online content, and I think our options in the next few years will be even more amazing.<p>I'm in agreement with the author that human interaction has to be fundamental to the educational process, but technology must play a role. Books themselves represent arguably the most important mass application of technology in modern history.<p>So the question for me is: does Khan (or Mathalicious for that matter) attempt to become a replacement for human interaction in education? I don't think so. That is still left to the freedom of any parent or teacher using the material. If more context needs to be applied to a given technology-driven lesson, then the parent or teacher is certainly not prevented from doing so.<p>The more I think about it, the more I think the author is simply advocating one abstract technological solution over another: his particular brand of context-driven content vs. Khan's more conventional content. Nowhere is the question of actual human interaction broached, just the question of whether qualified ""experts"" created the content to begin with. He may be correct that his content on the whole is better than Khan's, but his invocation of the ""human vs. technological"" seems to me yet another misdirection.<p>The real human element of education takes place in one-on-one situations, with a teacher or parent who can intuit where the child's understanding is at, respond in real-time to the student's own reactions, and change their approach in real-time accordingly. Nothing can replace the give-and-take of face-to-face teaching. Every student is different and real teachers know how to change their tactics slightly, drastically or somewhere in-between to help a student make that crucial conceptual breakthrough.<p>So to me, ""Mathalicious vs. Khan"" is merely pitting one abstract set of materials vs. another, and has nothing to do with ""human vs. technology."" I may use one of them or both or neither, but I won't give up my direct interaction with the student, and, having been raised by a teacher myself, I know that real teachers understand this as well.",1328471914

Lots and lots of templates.<p>It is very useful to be able to easily compile an algorithm for different types. If compiling a whole 10,000+ line algorithm 4 times for char/short/int/long inputs with templates and doing run-time branching between the algorithms (but not in the algorithms) saves 15% CPU time, then that is well worth the work. I don't know (well) any other language that offers that. Obviously if you introduce some kind of abstract base class / interface like Java, you will immediately lose the benefit of going int -> short -> char, when a class is alway at least... 12 bytes? 16?)<p>In C doing that requires a lot of macros and rapidly gets unusable, in Java it requires introducing lots of interfaces and hoping things get inlined.<p>What I like about C++ (compared again to Java/C, not Haskell), is that I can without fear of cost (other than compile time) introduce another layer of abstraction. When benchmarking code this is amazing, I can easily swap in a vector, or a deque, or an optimised fixed-size stack array.<p>In Java it is common for people to 'un-Java' code, introducing arrays of primitives instead of arrays of classes for example.<p>I don't know how well Haskel does at that kind of thing.",1328471424

The short answer is they can't, employers should stop filtering on presence of degree/cert/buzzword. For the jobs where certain certs might matter in a legal sense (certain areas of civics engineering I'm sure) I would hope they vet candidates above and beyond presence of the cert and knowledge of the most basic facts.<p>In practice, the result of cheating for a degree is the same as lying on a job application or resume. When the person gets hired for a job in that field their performance will make that job short-lived (if they're genuinely bad). Similar for putting a school and degree they didn't go to on their resume just to get hired. If they really don't know the material, their performance will show and worst-case the company lost six months of time they could have spent taking someone else through the hiring process. (Ed: okay, worst case is that the person's incompetence causes them to blow up the Earth on the first task they're given.)<p>If they do know the material, and their job performance is good, do you really care that they cheated for the degree or lied about having gotten it?

Udacity has a quite competitive teaching model -- there are cons compared to traditional schools, but also some pros.<p>But they don't have a research model. For a professor to leave their school and work somewhere like Udacity, they have to pretty much give up their research in favor of the opportunity to teach many students (online), and the money. Some may be willing to make the tradeoff, but most of the best professors won't and probably never will.<p>That's why I think the most successful online teaching programs will be affiliated with traditional universities. In CS, you could argue that the monetary resources needed to do research aren't as high, and you don't need specialized facilities. Maybe so. But you still need colleagues and collaborators -- especially in other fields like biology or engineering -- and you need grad students. And trying to do an online PhD doesn't sound very viable or desirable.<p>And in other fields than CS, where you absolutely need facilities, centers, etc to do research, it will be even harder to attract good faculty to a place that has none of these. You could build them all and bring in grad students, but then you're just a copy of a traditional university with no undergrads, and it's not clear why you didn't just partner with a traditional university in the first place.<p>So, this model may attract large numbers of students, but because of the research angle I don't see schools like these gaining the prestige and reputation necessary to draw students away from most traditional colleges.",1328470445

3554920,comment,3553983,3553983,27,0,dkarl,,,"Dijkstra is one of my favorite writers on programming, but I can't resist pointing out that he was on the wrong side of ""how to program if you cannot.""  We have a huge, thriving, valuable, and quite reliable information infrastructure built out of incorrect programs.  Dijkstra believed in correct programs and believed that software engineering would not succeed without them.  He believed it was counterproductive to teach people to program and employ them as programmers if they could not write correct programs.  He believed that the future of computing would be defined by the struggle to write correct programs, and that even if we managed to get by with incorrect programs, the cost would be much greater than if we had achieved the same results via correct programs.<p>Wow!  Can you imagine where we would be if we only had code written by people who had completed rigorous training in mathematics and formal methods?  Can you imagine a world where the middle ground between mathematics and the analog world was completely bare?  No Excel spreadsheets made by accountants, no customized HTML or CSS, no wiki markup even, because you can't trust amateurs to do <i>programming!</i>  It's hard to wrap my head around the idea that The Print Shop for the Apple II should never have existed, because the small minority of people suited for Dijkstra's rigorous training in mathematical programming would surely have been engaged on far more important projects.<p>Hmm, the essay is dated 1988.  I wonder if he still believed that a small class of elite programmers armed with formal methods would have created all of the wonderful programs I used at school around that time -- Print Shop, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, Math Blaster, and on and on -- did he believe his mathematician/programmers would have created all those programs and even more?  Or was he simply out of touch?  Ah, but how wonderfully and brilliantly out of touch.<p>He is also wrong about software aging and needing maintenance, as well, but there is an important lesson to learn from what he said.  As usual, he is right about the mistake in language even though he is wrong about the phenomenon it refers to:  programs are routinely transplanted from one context to another, because it is expensive or inconvenient to maintain their original context.  Aging and maintenance are a poor analogy.  Using poor language to address something is, in practice, less wrong than simply ignoring it, but we would be better off if we heeded Dijkstra's advice not to lean on bad analogies for novel situations.",1328470080

(Or the appropriate papers were obtainable through a test without requiring spending X amount of hours beforehand.) There's nothing fundamentally different about those fields as opposed to programming that make it so you can't learn the majority of the knowledge you'll need in the field from home. You can definitely diagnose without formal training--there's a story I heard of a guy who was having the signs and symptoms of a heart attack, googled them, realized he was having a heart attack, and called the ambulance. There's a book whose title I forget that describes in fine detail plumages, shapes, and other features about a huge variety of birds, but has no pictures, and it's commonly used by bird watchers to help them classify.<p>You may have an argument with biochemists since it's still a relatively new field, and specific universities are a decent place to find mentors, whereas historically you might just go seek a mentor from your local village or in the Big City for things like alchemy. The mentor may even have their own ""School of Me"", we don't have those anymore. Or maybe you might send a math paper to the Big Shot in Math in the UK, and if he likes it, he'll tell his circle of other math guys and suddenly you're ""in"" and will be recorded in the history books written by other people in the UK.<p>I think online media has revolutionized all fields of education and will continue to do so, but only in the simple way of making more correct information available and easier to acquire or recall. Self-learning is as old as books and online education only changes the source material from book to computer (which has a ton of benefits of course). I do agree with you that it is unlikely online education will ever completely replace having offline classes with other people, I know I would have preferred a programming mentor when I started out but all I had and knew of was a book. (It didn't occur to me then to seek out mentors at, say, a meetup.) The main reason I agree is because I don't foresee a decoupling of the university degree for a subject Y and a certification for doing Job X in a field sort of related to subject Y any time in the near future for many jobs, such as doctors and lawyers as you mentioned. What would be truly revolutionary for the Plebs is a mandate from the government saying HR departments can't require an accredited education, just as they can't require a particular race/sex/etc. (This won't stop discrimination of course just as the other mandates don't, but it would help I think even if it just dispels the notion that ""I need a degree to get a job"" that follows directly after ""I need a high school diploma / GED to get into college."")",1328469241

In particular, I've missed the natural syntax of higher order functions, e.g., currying and functional composition, as well as the pithy expressiveness of Prelude vs the STL.  With C++11, we can have these things, and while Boost gives us a wealth of functionality, it's hardly the most natural (and lightweight) library.<p>fc (functional composition) (<a href=""https://github.com/jdduke/fc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jdduke/fc</a>) and fpcpp (functional programming with C++)(<a href=""https://github.com/jdduke/fpcpp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jdduke/fpcpp</a>) are my recent (very much work-in-progress) efforts towards this end.<p>With fc, one can naturally compose functions, lambdas and function objects, e.g., given composable functions f, g, h, write auto fgh = f + g + h; or, auto fgh = compose(f, compose (h,g));, and then call it as fgh(a,b,c);<p>fpcpp enables syntax like<p><pre><code>  let pi = [](unsigned samples) -> double {\n      typedef std::pair<double,double> point;\n      let dxs = map([](const point& p) { return p.first*p.first + p.second*p.second; },\n                    zip(take(samples, rand_range(-1.0,1.0)),\n                        take(samples, rand_range(-1.0,1.0))));\n      return 4.0 * filter([](double d) { return d <= 1.0; }, dxs).size() / dxs.size();\n  }\n  EXPECT_NEAR(pi(10000), 3.14);\n</code></pre>\nIn writing fc and fpcpp, I've actually become less and less concerned for the future of C++; having used a good number of the C++11 features available, I've regained a good deal of my passion for C++ programming.

It is almost lawyer proof, if you do not mind me saying so.<p>The other beautiful aspect of it is that unlike many learning algorithms that have a training phase and a deployment phase (where it stops learning), a perceptron can keep on learning nonstop, even when deployed. The reason you can do this is because the learning algorithm only needs to process the new data point (and not the set of all old training data points augented by the new examples).<p>Now to the lawyer proof part, this requires that the algorithm keeps learning when it is deployed (what follows is correct, but nevertheless it is tongue in cheek): Say your client is that ""I will sue you at the drop of a hat"" kind. He/she wants you to promise on certain quality of performance. Well, with perceptrons there is a way. Just make him/her also sign that all past, current and future data points that the algorithm will come to see in its lifetime will be such that you can pass a slab of thickness <i>d</i> between the 2 classes.<p>Now you can guarantee that the algorithm will never ever make more than R^2/d^2 mistakes, regardless of how many examples it is tested on, even if you do not know what are the exact examples the algorithm will be tested on in the future. If the client comes back with a log that the algorithm made more mistakes than you promised, dont worry if the client threatens to sue, with that log you can sue them back, because in that log you have a counterexample to their claim that you can pass a slab of thickness d through the data that the algorithm was exposed to.<p>EDIT: R is the radius of the sphere that conatins all the data it saw. Search for perceptron and mistake bounds, the proof is surprisingly lucid (no calculus, just geometry and a little high-school algebra).",1328468803

Assembly is infantry: can do a lot of fine-grained work, but limited to about 5 mph with equipment. C is a tank-- a pretty powerful and impressive machine. It can shoot on the run and do 50 mph off-road. High-level languages are airplanes, perfect at 500 mph but coarse-grained from an operational standpoint. C++ exists because someone saw a tank and a plane and said, ""I'm going to put wings on <i>a fucking tank</i> and see what happens."" Thus, the tank-plane was born. The wings destroy its maneuverability on the ground and the weight of the tank makes it a shitty plane, and it looks fucking ridiculous, but there you go. Java exists because someone else concluded that the problem with tank-planes was that people were trying to fly them too fast and built an equally ridiculous invention-- the tank-icopter.<p><i>After I have defined a high-performance algorithm, they often want to modify it to make it ""more beautiful"" (which means functional) and in the process destroy the performance.</i><p>That's annoying. They should understand the concept of interface as separate from implementation.

Mutable state just needs to be used with taste.<p>What really pisses me off about that behavior pattern is when the tinkering is unnecessary. If it's working code, then who cares?

If there are no qualified workers in this country, it makes sense to allow companies to bring in talent from abroad. The problem is companies are too cheap to tap into the talent that exists here. This is bad social policy for a myriad reasons. The wealth of a nations workers helps create an environment where companies can flourish. Bringing in talent from overseas when there are workers here that can do the job (with some training) is in fact a net-negative for the country as a whole. It's not a swap: were not sending away the ""unqualified"" American, the system still has to support him somehow. Now he'll either have a lower paying job or in the case of the story in the article, he'll a burden on the country's safety net. This is a net negative for the integrity of the country.<p>For equal or nearly equal qualifications (by my definition), the local worker deserves the job. Companies don't start in vacuums. Their tax dollars has supported these companies, created environments where they can flourish, created a healthy workforce that allowed the company to grow, etc. The nations workers deserve the benefit of their ""investment"". Extremely liberal immigration policies may be a net positive for the world, but its decidedly a net negative for the workers here.<p>>This is a nation of immigrants where, as often as not, immigrants are the ones creating the jobs in the first place<p>Of course, the ones that are creating jobs can be let in :). But for every entrepreneur immigrant there are many times more rank-and-file worker who's job could probably be done by someone locally (with training perhaps).<p>>It's not a matter of nationality that decides how responsible you are for the wealth of the country.<p>Yeah it is? As a citizen, I'm certainly more responsible for the wealth of this country than a non-citizen chosen at random.",1328468440

I used backticks to do things like grab a nameserver from /etc/resolv.conf and then ping the server, but I had the surrounding Ruby code doing things like parsing the output using regular expressions and doing some logic on the results.<p>Sure, I could have written the thing in pure bash, but Ruby has better text manipulation capabilities when it comes to things like parsing (in my opinion), and with the backticks, I still was able to harness the power of the shell anyways.<p>I'm not sure how portable such solutions are, but for a home-grown testing program written on a whim out of boredom, it was certainly enjoyable to have both the power of Ruby and the shell available.",1328468421

I don&#x27;t see the switch away from it as more churn but as an acknowledgment that it was a wrong direction for web front end technology.<p>Honestly, I hate to say it, because it is becoming the trendy framework, but my personal opinion is that React is a step back towards the write direction. Events and Web Components lead to decoupled code that can be treated as independent black boxes. Which translates to a scalable and maintainable UI codebase. We have circled around this concept with a few frameworks over the years but none of them have hit critical mass like React/Flux seems to be doing.<p>Anyways long story short, I know these has been a lot of churn in the front end world, but I see this one as a needed and correcting step to get UI development back on track.",1424141684

It&#x27;d be interesting to see if the slope of the graph is steeper for minor blunders that reduce the evaluation by less than a pawn.  These are the more subtle positional errors - weakening a square, not maximizing piece activity, wrecking your pawn structure, etc.  Amateur games are filled with these mistakes, but they are much rarer in GM games, and I&#x27;d expect the difference to be more than just a few percentage points.

Are you referencing an earlier discussion of a machine that demonstrated a proof of &quot;0=1&quot; using the axioms of ZFC? If so, what is your concern?<p>When thinking about undecidability/independence from a computational perspective, it&#x27;s helpful to be cautious about the phrase &quot;does not halt&quot;. How would you know a machine &quot;does not halt&quot;? You might run it for a long time and observe that it has not halted <i></i>yet<i></i>, but that&#x27;s not the same.<p>Instead, you can talk about &quot;a proof in $AXIOM_SYSTEM that this machine does not halt&quot;.<p>So, using that terminology, consider a machine that enumerates all valid proofs of ZFC and checks if their conclusion is &quot;0 = 1&quot;. Certainly, if ZFC is inconsistent, this machine will find a proof and halt. However, if there is no such proof, then ZFC is consistent, the machine will not halt, but there will be no proof in ZFC that the machine will not halt.<p>This ability to enumerate the proofs is related to semidecidability/recursive-enumerability.<p>When you say &quot;for sufficiently large n, we won&#x27;t be able to prove that BB(n) = N&quot;, I agree. There is some n that is so large that there is a Turing machine of size n that does loop, but the fact that it loops will not be provable in ZFC.",1424140789

According to Nelson, speaking about such numbers might lead to condradictions, just like speaking about &quot;the set of all sets that don&#x27;t contain themselves&quot; leads to a contradiction.<p>He also relates these issues to Christian philosophy, which I find very interesting.

To be more specific, white moved the king which appeared (at first glance) to prevent black from using a check threat to attack white&#x27;s rook. The blunder was in not realizing that the check threat could still be used to attack white&#x27;s rook, albeit in a more complicated fashion.<p>Black responded to this with another &quot;blunder&quot; -- failing to attack the rook and moving elsewhere instead. But this blunder was NOT independent of the first -- it is quite likely (I believe) that black saw the move and assumed white had successfully prevented the attack on the rook.

The first blunder helped cause the second.<p>(Thanks to stolio for linking to the game analysis I used here.)<p>One could test this hypothesis of mine using the same data set.

Meanwhile, even by BB(6) the TM is metaphorically &quot;using&quot; incomprehensible tricks to be larger than we&#x27;d even dream. If repeated iterations of BB&#x27;ness can be trivially described in, say, 10 states, and let&#x27;s say we reserve 4 states for BB(4) to describe the number of times to iterate, our hand-constructed &quot;clever&quot; re-iteration of the BB procedure will be <i>blown away</i> by some other 10-state machine that we can&#x27;t even imagine would ever terminate.<p>So on the one hand, yes, BB(BB(20)) is incomprehensibly larger than merely BB(20), and yet, on the other hand, in a profound way, it also doesn&#x27;t matter. Busy Beaver in a sense shows us numbers that have all the practical properties of infinity, even if they are not technically infinite. In a sense BB(30) < BB(31) is obviously true, yet, ultimately, a humanly meaningless statement, since grasping either number in any sense beyond its mere definition is impossible. We might as well say that &quot;blibble&quot; is less than &quot;bloo&quot;. And not merely impossible in the sense that it is impossible to even really properly grasp just how far it is to Alpha Centauri, but impossible in the sense that we are literally incapable of even constructing mathematical tools that will let us grab on to and manipulate such numbers... deeply, profoundly, computationally impossible for us to understand, not merely &quot;mind-blowing&quot;, but <i>impossible</i> for us to understand in the absolute strongest sense of the term.<p>Similarly for trying to catch up to BB with yet more iterations of exponentiation... the procedure we humans use is shockingly, shockingly simple to describe programmatically, which means that BB automatically already encompasses practically all such tricks very early in its sequence, which means you can&#x27;t defeat it that way.<p>Busy Beaver is metaphorically (again) much smarter than you, and it&#x27;s not worth your time to try to outsmart it to make yet again bigger numbers.<p>This also, probably correctly, implies that attempting to adjudicate some contest in which some people write BB(BB(BB(x)))) vs some other BB-based notation is also impossible and you&#x27;d actually fail out of the contest for writing an ill-defined number, as if we can&#x27;t compare the two numbers for which is larger, even in principle, it is for the purposes of this contest, ill-defined. Busy Beaver in a sense also sets the limit of what a well-defined number even can be, and is thus in some sense the natural limit of this contest by virtue of simply <i>transcending</i> through sheer incomprehensible size all our computationally-naive human tricks for making big numbers, or even just numbers of any size at all.<p>It&#x27;s really a profound sequence.",1424139185

Laboring on construction projects, joining armies, digging minerals out of holes, seasonal work on farms, serving on ships, and so on have been ways for people to earn a living for millennia, selling their labor, not their produce. Having the capital to ply a trade or craft - money to buy raw materials, and tools to add value to them - would have been beyond the reach of most people for a lot of history. There&#x27;s always been a labor market.<p>I guess what you mean is that the industrial revolution massively increased the amount of capital you needed to be able to produce goods competitively. Buying a set of tools and some raw materials to make things by hand stopped being a viable route out of the labor market into &#x27;entrepreneurship&#x27; when mass machine-produced goods could be supplied more cheaply. Your option was to sell your labor to someone who owned some big machines, much like your ancestors sold theirs to people who owned a patch of fertile land, or a big pile of wood they wanted making into a ship.<p>So in a sense it created the modern labor market in that it locked a lot more people into it, and obviously diversified the kinds of jobs that existed. On the other hand, it was, as you say, a massive productivity multiplier which meant we were able to create more and more wonderful and complex goods for, in real terms, less and less cost, to the point where nowadays by exchanging your labor for cash, you can soon have enough money to afford a box of electronics that fits in your pocket and allows you to access all the world&#x27;s information.",1424138772

We are ants in a giant, unimaginably successful ant colony. Focusing on the life of an individual ant is what is absurd.",1424138548

That&#x27;s not paranoia, that&#x27;s fact, unless you think they&#x27;d target Reddit only for some reason, which makes no sense. So why can&#x27;t we talk about them? If we don&#x27;t face up to the reality of this kind of propaganda, we won&#x27;t be able to have proper discussions about important topics like this one.<p>As the other responder to me pointed out, this account had ONE post to its name almost a year ago before the post I responded to today.

There are definitely still a few rough edges, especially with analytical queries as you&#x27;d pointed out.<p>As far as basic operations (inserts, updates, retrieving documents etc.) are concerned, RethinkDB already has competitive performance and we hope to publish official benchmark results soon. As you know, good, comparable benchmarks aren&#x27;t easy, and we&#x27;re currently spending most of our time on improving RethinkDB rather than working on those. But they&#x27;re definitely coming.<p>This is just a guess, but a query involving COUNT(*) might execute faster with PostgreSQL since it can use an index for making the count basically a constant-time operation, while RethinkDB doesn&#x27; currently support this. That is definitely a missing feature on our end.<p>If you get a chance, I&#x27;d be very happy to hear from you about the specific queries and the data you&#x27;d been testing, so we can look into those specific performance problems.

The script appears to embed an invisible iframe pointing to a page on that domain, which probably infects the machine using some zero-day exploit on the browser or one of its plugins. The domain is still registered, but appears not to be running an HTTP server anymore. Might be interesting to investigate if someone wants to look into that.<p>[0] <a href=""http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/malicious-php-script-1280x719.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/malici...</a>",1424138477

That is pretty much what they are doing here... code is easy to move around and to copy. Today (or in relatively short amount of time) who wants that code bad enough will be able to find it. That technology that took yeas and million of dollars to develop is now available to the bad guys. Face palm!",1424138472

The thing that suggests that the increase in price would generally be restrained such that the <i>quantity</i> of goods the net beneficiaries could afford would still increase despite the price level increase is &quot;elasticity&quot;.",1424138435

And I guess the obvious follow up to that is, is that basically what these austerity measures amount to?",1424138413

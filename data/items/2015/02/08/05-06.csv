9016558,comment,9015355,9015355,0,0,markbnj,,,"Ignoring the obviously opinionated cruft and hyper-aggressive uber geek disdain, which appears to make up about 70% of this post, there are still one or two actual statements worth examining. Fwiw I run a small site, fifteen or so instances, and we&#x27;ve been using Docker in our deployment for about a year now.<p>> Lets say you want to build multiple images of a single repo, for example a second image which contains debugging tools, but both using the same base requirements. Docker does not support this.<p>Of course it does. It appears that it doesn&#x27;t support it the way you think it should, but to say that you can&#x27;t do it is misleading. A base image, and two images that pull from it with the different requirements will solve the problem. You apparently don&#x27;t like that solution, but that is not the same thing as not having a solution.<p>> there is no ability to extend a Dockerfile<p>Yeah, this would be nice. Maybe they will add it. But it is hardly... not even close to... a make-or-break feature. Honestly I think you might just need to refactor your stuff, or perhaps Docker just isn&#x27;t a fit for what you&#x27;re doing.<p>> using sub directories will break build context and prevent you using ADD/COPY<p>You mean if you include a bunch of stuff in subdirectories that you don&#x27;t want uploaded to the demon. Again, man, not even close to make or break. You really need to log gigabytes to a subdirectory in your build context? There&#x27;s _no other way_ you could set that up? We create gigs of logs too, but most of them are events that go to logstash and get indexed into ES. Our file-based logs go to mount points outside the container. We do have images we build using context, where we ADD or COPY multi-gigabyte static data files. Seems to work fine.<p>> and you cannot use env vars at build time to conditionally change instructions<p>No, you can&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not sure I would want to. I like the fact that the Dockerfile is a declarative and static description of the dependencies for a deployment. I don&#x27;t think I want to have to debug conditional evaluation at build time. There are other ways to solve those problems, like refactoring your images.<p>> Our hacky workaround was to create a base image, two environment specific images and some Makefile automation which involved renaming and sed replacement. There are also some unexpected &quot;features&quot; which lead to env $HOME disappearing, resulting in unhelpful error messages. Absolutely disgusting.<p>First of all, what exactly is hacky about having a base image and two environment-specific images? I don&#x27;t know what sort of makefile automation you&#x27;re talking about, but we do some environment specific sed manipulation of configs at build time, and in some cases at container launch time. Sometimes that makes more sense than having two different versions of the container just to have a very slight change to the config.<p>Secondly... absolutely disgusting? Is that the sort of language you regularly use in technical writing? Oh, hey, look at the third paragraph: &quot;If you expect anything positive from Docker, or its maintainers, then you&#x27;re shit outta luck.&quot; I guess it is. The strike-out font was a nice touch, man. &quot;I don&#x27;t really mean this, but you can&#x27;t help reading it!&quot; Nobody&#x27;s ever done that before.<p>> These problems are caused by the poor architectural design of Docker as a whole, enforcing linear instruction execution even in situations where it is entirely inappropriate<p>You&#x27;re not talking about linear instruction execution. You&#x27;re talking about grouping instructions into commited layers. I would much prefer the proposed LAYER command to conditional execution or branching, which is what I assume you mean by non-linear in your comment. But I don&#x27;t find this to be a serious problem either. That seems to be a pattern with this post: in a year of using Docker to containerize all our services - in-house python code, Django, redis, logstash, elasticsearch, postgresql - I haven&#x27;t run into these issues that are deal breakers for you. Again, you might want to try to refactor and simplify some of your image builds. It&#x27;s better to have a few simpler containers talking to each other than to try to cram a complex multi-service deployment into one. But then, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, and maybe it&#x27;s just not suited for containers. You seem to have a strong preference for VMs anyway, so do that.<p>> However the Docker Hub implementation is flawed for several reasons. Dockerfile does not support multiple FROM instructions (per #3378, #5714 and #5726), meaning you can only inherit from a single image.<p>This whole post is like a laundry list of Absolutely Critical Things Nobody Ever Needed. I can&#x27;t imagine a situation in which you&#x27;d absolutely have to be able to inherit from multiple images. If you have that situation I would agree it&#x27;s an indicator Docker won&#x27;t work the way you currently want to do things. I do agree with you about the occasional speed issues on the hub. But they&#x27;re giving it to lots of people for free, and to me for a ridiculously low price. If I need better performance I can always run my own registry.<p>> There are some specific use cases in which containerisation is the correct approach, but unless you can explain precisely why in your use case, then you should probably be using a hypervisor instead.<p>There are some specific use cases in which virtualization is the correct approach, but unless you can explain precisely why in your use case, then you should probably be using containers instead.<p>See what I did there?<p>> If your development workflow is sane, then you will already understand that Docker is unnecessary.<p>I do like to read even-handed, unbiased reviews of technologies like Docker, even when I already use them. I like to have my world view challenged with an exposition of solid critical points. Maybe someone will write an article like that.",1423374967

In year 1 a company doesn&#x27;t experience much in terms of both contractions or cancellations, especially if it&#x27;s a product that is sold on an annual deal basis.

Any amateur radio operator in the Midwest or Florida using AM on 144MHz will tell you that lightning for sure interferes with reception. With FM, not so much.",1423372802

Bad abstractions are bad.<p>Additional complexity without additional functionality, increased dependencies without increasing stability, poor documentation and buggy implementations; strongly coupled things which have no business being coupled and overt assumptions on what kind of application you are writing and how you ought to structure it.<p>They have fundamentals which don&#x27;t interact with anything else - events that won&#x27;t be caught, arrays that use their own iterator, etc.<p>They decide to suppress language features like console logging and replace it using different names. You never learn this by reading the outdated documentation but by startling discoveries 45 minutes into what ought to have been a 15 second bug.<p>And let&#x27;s not get started on how utterly useless the call stack or object inspector becomes.<p>They presume there are fewer coherent approaches to programming in a language then there actually are so they shoehorn you into writing things in one specific poorly documented, buggy, highly complex, inappropriate, monolithic, and fragile way.<p>One of the main arguments for the abstraction approach is that they assist average programmers like a golfing handicap.

9016478,comment,9013779,9014312,0,0,scobar,,,"I&#x27;m curious to know how you admit it. I recently completed a website redesign for a relative in Brazil. He wanted to use the existing MySQL db and some PHP functions, and expand on both. I had some experience with HTML, very little with CSS and Javascript, and had never built a website using a text editor alone for the code. I&#x27;d just completed the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery courses on Codecademy and was excited to apply what I&#x27;d learned, but I made it very clear that I wasn&#x27;t an expert at frontend code nor design and had no PHP nor databse experience and would need to learn them to complete the project.<p>He showed me various websites and features he liked, and I recreated them with HTML, CSS, and jQuery designing the new site to his satisfaction in about 5 days. Then, I powered through a couple tutorials on PHP and MySQL for a couple days. Most of the old PHP that he wanted to salvage was filled with deprecated code, so I rewrote it. The data he wanted to store and use for the new site required entirely new db tables. So the new site didn&#x27;t reuse any of the old code. It took me a month to complete the site and get it online. A few days later, the owner of a quite-a-bit larger company that partners with my relative&#x27;s company told him that he really liked the new site, and asked for my info. My relative told me that I was far too modest about my ability before I took on his project; that I wasn&#x27;t an amateur at all.<p>I know that I was and still consider myself very much an amateur, but I know I can (and enjoy to) learn new technologies pretty quickly. I take pride in doing a job well, and really believe I&#x27;ll provide a lot of value to the projects I work on. I just can&#x27;t sell myself without being completely honest about areas that I know I have lots left to learn. How can I be completely honest without seeming incompetent next to a &#x27;professional&#x27; (and great salesman) who only knows how to plug content into a CMS template? How do you express your confidence in the value you create when you&#x27;re aware you will have to learn a lot to create that value?",1423372212

9016471,comment,9015092,9016403,0,0,NobleLie,,,"> Rather than artificially fixing the supply of labor at an arbitrary level and penalizing people for their honest work until some give up, it&#x27;s better to &quot;buy out&quot; the laziest among us. Sure they won&#x27;t be contributing to society, but at least they won&#x27;t prevent others from receiving fair compensation which is exactly what happens in the otherwise inevitable race to the bottom.<p>I feel like you are missing the point that the &quot;bottom&quot; (lazy?  I would most likely disagree...lazy + unfortunate genes / birth status / location perhaps) has a much better, easier, fairer chance (in obvious unison with a reduction of unemployment,) given organizations reduce the time worked per day, thus opening up opportunities for currently employed (more leisure time) and the unemployed (the jobless)<p>That&#x27;s not to say this model has severe flaws.  It&#x27;s more utopian than what are we faced in capitalist societies now, but goes against business profit maximization, which I&#x27;ll simplify in a useful manner: organizations like to hire as few people as possible and use as much of their leisure time as possible in order to reduce benefits expected by most workers increasingly expensive benefits that they&#x27;ve come to expect in long term cushy jobs.<p>The recent uptick in free lance jobs is rough for this very reason.  It&#x27;s less risky to sell most your leisure time to  large companies.<p>That&#x27;s my personal diagnosis. As for my solution...the the non risk averse must continue(create) their own entrepreneurship endeavors and as the older generation dies out, destroy the [8-9]-[5-6] scourge imbued unto us by unionized industrialists of the past and craft new culture.  Keep companies running smoothly with more employees working less time.  Any opinions/counterpoints would be appreciated.  I&#x27;d perhaps be considered an idealist with high expectations of the future.<p>P.S Long time lurking/reading here on HN and finally beginning to post.

And locomotive engineers are &quot;engineers&quot;, and it looks like they don&#x27;t even need post-secondary schooling [2].<p>And the rules around the P.Eng. titles are provincially regulated as opposed to federally, meaning the rules in Ontario (where apparently the term &quot;Engineer&quot; is protected) is different than in Alberta (where the protected term is &quot;Professional Engineer&quot;).<p>That&#x27;s why in Alberta, Raymond Merhej was sued for using the title &quot;systems engineer&quot; (as an Apple Canada-certified systems engineer) but the suit was dismissed in late 2003.  In response, the Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta (APEGGA) said basically they&#x27;ll lobby the government to amend the laws to prevent that in the future. [3]  I don&#x27;t know if such an amendment was ever completed though.<p>I wonder if engineers in traditional fields are protective of their title because they work with a lot of engineering technicians, so they feel they need to differentiate and protect their work?<p>[1] <a href=""http://cmea-agmc.ca/our-heritage-and-our-stories"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cmea-agmc.ca/our-heritage-and-our-stories</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www5.hrsdc.gc.ca/noc/english/noc/2011/Profile.aspx?val=7&val1=7361"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www5.hrsdc.gc.ca/noc/english/noc/2011/Profile.aspx?va...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.itbusiness.ca/news/it-industry-wins-round-in-engineering-name-debacle/4133"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itbusiness.ca/news/it-industry-wins-round-in-engi...</a>",1423371643

It bought a ton of patents, and while it hasn't sued with them, it has transferred some of them to partner companies that did sue. So Google is involved in the patent battle, by proxy.<p>I do agree though that Microsoft is clearly abusing the patent system far more. It files far more lawsuits, and I have yet to see one about a patent that actually sounds reasonable.",1318903192

In Windows 7, some ""improvements"" seem to result in abysmal file copying performance on a very noticeable proportion of machines/networks. The Web is full of such stories, and the best anyone has come to fixing them is basically random tweaking of low-level network parameters that no user should ever have to go anywhere near on the off chance that turning off something supposedly beneficial will fix whatever incompatibility or feedback loop is crippling performance on any given system.<p>On Windows XP, you could navigate folders in the tree in explorer by clicking once to expand and open a folder. In Windows 7, I have yet to find any way to avoid double-clicking or aiming for those dinking little triangles to expand each folder, which is not terribly efficient on a modern large, high-resolution display. Also, why do they hide the triangles unless you're hovering in the correct area with the mouse? Might a user not want to know which folders they can see in the tree also contain nested subfolders? Again, Windows XP did this fine, and the Windows 7 behaviour is objectively inferior in this respect.",1318903022

I worry not about my past overlapping with my present, but my ""real life"" crashing into my digital one. While it certainly doesn't take much to piece together who I am, I do get oddly disconcerted by people who I grew up with who are only now getting online. I've mostly avoided it by not visiting Facebook anymore.<p>I like to compare the Internet to a swimming pool, only, it operates exactly the opposite as you'd expect. Normally adults would be wary of children getting into the deep end, as it's less safe. But on the Internet, not only are the younger ones far better swimmers who live in the deep end... The adults stay in the kiddie pool/inlet. One scary run-in with the deep end, and they never want to ""swim"" again.<p>I'm very curious about the effects this is having on society.

I disagree with that assumption. Most of the times you don't know that you want a specific functionality until the technology comes that implements it. Then you realize that you wanted it 'all along.' You are shaped by your environment more than you shape it.<p>Your time is indeed better spent doing things other than upgrading, the reason being that the software business just hasn't been able to keep up with the advances in hardware. Even though we have so much computational power available to us, we still haven't learned how to handle complexity and make more interesting, flexible interfaces. There can be innovation in document publishing software, even though we haven't seen any for such a long time.

3123408,comment,3122798,3123284,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"In the ideal world, the spec would be open and anyone could implement it in their service (be it a browser or other). For most operating systems we're talking about something that looks like a device connected over a serial port. The Android service is pretty straight forward and I've played a bit with ideas on an old G1 which had a serial port hidden in the USB port, not sure about iOS. Computers like laptops etc its very straight forward (for both wireless and wired solutions).<p><i>""Also, you wouldn't be able to log into a public terminal.""</i><p>Actually depending on capability (no pun intended) I could easily see 'read' access being usable without the key but recognize the issue there. The real 'issue' if you will is universal appeal/buy-in which is to say if anyone can use it then you will get some early adopters who will provide support as a differentiating factor and that can drive adoption into more slowly changing markets. Because it has to be everywhere to be effective it won't be a big money maker (this is where a lot of VCs stop listening :-) basically the barrier to implementing it has to be 0 and the value to the implementor has to be non-zero. Given how thinly marginallize 'security' fixes are, this margin won't leave anything for the manufacturer in terms of on going revenue so the key itself has to define the value for the company. (I've actually thought a lot about this :-)<p>So to your point, for early adopters the experience would be to get a 'key' and to install a plug-in and then enabled sites and services would be secured. Pretty easy sell to an enterprise if their only cost is the 'fob cost' and there isn't some giant consulting revenue stream attached to it. For big companies it has to be completely implementable (once the key infrastructure is set up) in a way that is custom (and probably private) that enterprise. That gives their IT folks confidence and it makes the risk low.<p>For more general engagements like PayPal or Facebook its a bit different. On things that are appifyable (if that makes sense) there is a potential for differentiation (look at how the World of Warcraft Authenticator stuff was worth it for them to implement).<p>The key for me is that the existing way of doing things is under attack and it will eventually succumb, when it does there is a tremendous opportunity there.",1318901913

Or so claims the press release [1]. Looking at the the research project page [2], it appears to involve at least seven major universities, a lot of government funding, and several private corporate collaborators. While some of the pieces may be open, the license for the project itself only allows for non-commercial use.<p>It's also fantastically complex and combines many state of the art techniques. While it's certainly possible for a company to reproduce much of the implementation from the open pieces, it is a lot more than 8 hours of work.<p>All said, Siri is an amazing accomplishment, and more than anything, a great example of why science funding is important.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sri.com/news/releases/020510.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sri.com/news/releases/020510.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://pal.sri.com/Plone/framework"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pal.sri.com/Plone/framework</a>",1318901665

It's easier to say that they're conditionals and loops since that's what programmers are familiar with.

I woke up one morning and decided I couldn't continue doing that or I would have some serious health issues down the road. The next morning I stopped drinking my milk that way, every couple of days I would cheat and have 1 glass, but then I would feel guilty and stop again. I'm 19 now and I drink one glass of 1% milk every breakfast, work out 3 times a week and I stick to a healthy diet that fits my goals.<p>Perhaps what you need is a lifestyle change and a new way of thinking about those cravings. I firmly believe in the saying ""healthy body, healthy mind"", and that shy's me away from anything unhealthy.<p>Of course I'm no saint so I choose 1 cheat day a week and I eat as much junk food as possible, after the day's over I don't want to look or eat any junk food until the next cheat day.<p>--<p>I should also mention that at around 16 I became very interested in fitness and nutrition so I spent most hours reading up on it. It made me more aware that our bodies are just really REALLY beautiful machines, in order for it to run at full throttle you want to feed it the proper nutrients or else it will just chug a long.",1280066379

1545507,comment,1545325,1545325,0,0,kochbeck,,,"The answer to this question tends to greatly depend on whether you overeat / eat in an otherwise unhealthy way such that it's causing you harm or if you merely don't like the idea of eating junk, so you want to cut back.<p>For instance, I'm just finishing a medically supervised protein-sparing modified fast where I lost 70 pounds in 5 months by eating only prescription liquid foods and only about 800 calories a day. This has the effect of ""rebooting"" your cravings. I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to some fresh vegetables and fruit right now, and I used to be a big junk food craver. Having said that, you'd think 5 months of not eating anything except protein pudding would be difficult, but it was incredibly easy, and I enjoyed it a lot. And it mostly unscrambled the signals to my brain that said, ""Eat all the cookies you can find,"" that ran 24 hours a day.<p>If that sounds like you, and your weight or other stats like triglycerides / cholesterol / liver enzymes / blood sugar are unhealthy, you should see a doctor and ask about medical weight management right away. I can tell you from experience that it's a lot easier to lose 20 pounds than it is to lose 70, so you can't win by waiting. Also, a great book on the subject is David Kessler's ""The End of Overeating."" He goes into great detail on the psychological and chemical triggers that induce hypereating.<p>Now, on the other hand, if you're just prone to snacking on junk in fairly moderate ways, you ought to exercise a little environmental control:<p>- Shop at farmer's markets for veggies and corner grocers for milk and staples.<p>- Don't go to the supermarket. If you do go to the supermarket, only shop the aisles with wholesome foods, and never buy anything on the eye-level shelves (the worst, most processed stuff).<p>- Don't bring junk home. If you buy something junky, buy only one serving. If it only comes in multi-serving packs, take one serving out, then freeze the rest. Make it harder to dig into.<p>It's also useful to keep records of your eating. If you have an iPhone, I had a lot of success with the app LoseIt. Studies show that people keep off 50% more weight when they keep records than when they don't. If you're mindful of what you're eating and how you're eating it, you create brief openings in which you actually have a choice to eat or not rather than to just eat mindlessly. It also helps to know what macronutrients (fat, sugar, protein, fiber, salt) you're consuming and in what balance. If it's out of balance, shop in a way that balances it out.<p>Consider foods that induce satiety. Protein has the highest satiety value - if you have to snack, try a protein pudding or shake first, let it settle in your stomach, and see if you're still hungry. Add water on top of that, because thirst often feels like hunger.<p>Finally, if you seem to be resolving your hunger, but you still feel an overwhelming urge to eat in spite of not being physically hungry, see a doctor or psychiatrist who specializes in eating behaviors. Most people who compulsively eat have no idea they're doing it because A) it snuck up on them over a number of years and B) everyone around them does it too (consider how many startups we've seen full of thin young folks who turned into chunky folks while they worked together).<p>Good luck!",1280064480

The first doesn't strike me as particularly novel, or objectionable.<p>> This is a slope that we have been sliding down for some time. While ignorance of the law has generally been excluded as a defense in criminal cases, our system of laws is becoming so convoluted that it is almost impossible to know and understand the applicable law.<p>This isn't a good thing by any means, but the issue of the law being unknown or incomprehensible to laypeople is nothing new. Take common-law requirements. Honestly, how many people read the relevant case law, or even understand its general effect? People have bumped along for, literally, centuries knowing little more than the broad outline of the law.<p>I'd also point out that ""increasingly codified"" isn't synonymous with ""increasingly convoluted""; common-law rules are often pretty convoluted.<p>> Thus we are all at risk.<p>I'd actually suggest that the general level of legal knowledge has improved. Thanks to the Internet it's at least possible to get at the content of laws without access to a specialised library.",1280063533

HackerNews is frequented far more by programmers with serious breadth and depth of interest and far less by people looking for a quick fix or help with the learning curve. The resulting fondness for arcane languages and esoteric solutions can at times be overwhelwing even for the motivated novice.<p>On the one hand I think it's important for even non-tech people interested in that startup ecosystem to gain a basic understanding of how hackers think and the choices they face, which is my chief motivation for reading a lot of the programming articles posted here.",1280063423

Facebook isn't just a company that has ""recently become cash flow positive"", it's a company that's been highly valued for at least six years.  In June 2004 Peter Thiel invested $500K for 7% (giving it a valuation of $7.1M) and Accel Partners invested $12.7M in May 2005 (valuation ~ $100M).  I'm not sure you can say it would be a waste of time to sue for ownership of Facebook as it existed at either of those points as it was clearly valued by astute investors.",1280063325

Albeit not in the concrete way you've put forward, but something analogous to it.<p>If my startup takes off and I am at a stable plateau then I think that I can run a program like this on the premises. I could ask the people who are working with me to tutor/mentor kids by building stuff with them. Further, by having a hiring bias I can choose people with a personality that makes them more suited for such a thing.<p>In the longer run wouldn't it be awesome to fund a Xerox PARC that doubles up as a school?

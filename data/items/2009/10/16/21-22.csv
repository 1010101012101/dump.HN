886268,comment,885961,886119,0,0,evgen,,,"This really only works with old eggs, where the temperature differential can help separate the albumen from the inner shell.  To quote the master:<p>""...the best guarantee of an easy peeling is to use old eggs! Difficult peeling is characteristic of fresh eggs with a relatively low albumen pH, which somehow causes the albumen to adhere to the inner shell membrane more strongly than it adheres to itself.  At the pH typical of several days of refrigeration, around 9.2, the shell peels easily.  If you end up with a carton of very fresh eggs and need to cook them right away, you can add a half teaspoon of baking soda to a quart of water to make the cooking water alkaline (though this intensifies the sulfury flavor).""

A better comparison would be CDN pricing for Limelight or CDNetworks, the other two big players. It's worth bearing in mind that a lot of peering contracts for major carriers (but not necessarily Tier 1 - for example BT, Telefonica etc) depend on having a backbone - Akamai doesn't have a backbone, their backbone is the internet.<p>Also Google only do HTTP, so no Flash RTMP or Microsoft streaming which you effectively subsidise with an http product from a CDN.",1255730254

In an argument, don't patronize your opponent, just focus on defending and making your points.<p>Obviously things are not as simple as they look, otherwise, we would not be talking about it.<p>Now that this is out of the way. I think that quality is a pretext. Apple could have let developers distribute their application by other mean, and keep the same AppStore quality. The fact that AppStore is the only way to distribute an iPhone app does not make it higher quality. I would actually argue the opposite. If developers had other means to distribute their mobile application, Apple could fairly refuse the ""iFart"" type of applications and accept only applications that have real entertainment or productivity value.<p>Also, I know people developing iPhone apps, and while they welcome the additional income, it is not that easy to make a living out of it.

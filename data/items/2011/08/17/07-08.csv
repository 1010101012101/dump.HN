You now have to know where a view was created and presented from in order to change any of the view's content around at a later date. With tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:, you don't have to worry about where it came from, because the view controller is responsible for managing its own content.<p>Also: as an aside, you should be caching all of your NS*Formatter objects at a per-thread level, rather than recreating every time you need them -- formatters are very expensive to create and set up.",1313567877

For most things they don't usually look at the same stuff multiple times. An average MRI is pretty low resolution and can fit in under 50mb (average 10mb, 50-60 for fMRI scans) of storage thus it's not to expensive to redownload it. For surface data it's even less, my average brain surface is also under 10mb. Most of my users are on University networks which helps a lot.<p>Also applications in the chrome web store can get around the  local storage limitation. I'd browsers to offer a quota system where the user can assign a max amount to their applications. That would solve those issues.",1313567779

The only issue is i wasn't following my passion and it made me feel well and truly down EVERY SINGLE DAY (was there for about 2 years).<p>For about 3 months prior to putting in my resignation i was also already working on a side project that started getting legs and had started to bring in ramen profitable google ads profit so that It allowed me to quit work and still be able to eat whilst not touching to much of savings along with also paying for some small amazon servers to keep the service running. I thought what the hey, lets give it a go so i quit. Shocked everyone, including parents but i just couldn't go on any longer. It hurt to much... and IT in banks just totally suck.<p>Also like the article says planned an exercise regime, my work hours for my currently little side project and hanging to start on Peter Norvig and Andrew Ng's classes when they start. Never felt this excited in a while.<p>I think the caveat though is that while being unemployed (currently like I am) is better then having a lousy job , not being able to put food on the table is lousier then a lousy job.

The regime used to be very simple, it's gotten more complex as time went on.<p>Right now I'm at 110 pushups, 130 situps, 50 side situps, 3min abdominal bridge and 10 minutes of jumprope or shadow boxing.<p>I used to also do two hours of boxing at a gym three times a week and that was really the best thing ever until it got too expensive.<p>But the best effect of doing this every day isn't even physical. It's the knowledge that no matter how sucky a day turns out to be, I have done something to better myself.",1313565606

They pay 1.25% for a 3 year bond, up to 3.625% for a 10 year bond.<p>Theoretically I guess Google could care about their S&P credit rating (as opposed to this <i>stock</i> rating) if it made it harder for them to sell them in the future. Judging from how low the rate they had to pay on those bonds I suspect they wouldn't have any trouble selling them anyway.<p>Their credit rating is very unlikely to drop while they are highly profitable and sitting on a pile of cash though.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/20/us-markets-credit-idUSTRE74J4NK20110520"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/20/us-markets-credit-...</a>",1313565289

I mostly use them on weekends or after normal office hours so it won't distract other people. Exactly what I do varies but often I'll do something like submaximal sets (e.g. 15 pull-ups followed by 15 ring dips) on the hour, every hour, throughout the day. It's a good way to build strength endurance, and it really helps my body reset and relax so I can concentrate more on thinking.<p>""Any exercise"" is definitely better than nothing at all, but I'd do something that addresses your specific issues. For example, I tend to get really tense in my shoulders and upper back when I'm programming, and doing push-ups to failure is a great way of releasing the tension. Back when I was completely out of shape, I managed to build up to 40 push-ups per set in a month of just doing them daily to release tension. I started at 10 and just added one more rep per set every day. It was a nice bonus.",1313564688

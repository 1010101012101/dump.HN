8469376,comment,8466812,8467101,0,0,comex,,,"I&#x27;ve had serious performance issues with Yosemite.  For one, dragging around windows became extremely janky; this appears to be caused by the transparency (and the limitations of my first-generation Retina MBP), as the option to disable it fixes the jank.  For another, opening a new tab in Safari started lagging about a full second before I could start typing in the address bar, which is a ridiculous amount of time compared to the previous version or competition.  I was able to fix this by disabling Top Sites, but while I don&#x27;t actually use Top Sites much, I never had to disable it before, and most users won&#x27;t know to do that, making it a serious regression.  (Chrome actually takes quite a while to load its equivalent - I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s for the same reason or not - but it does it asynchronously, so I can start typing in the address bar almost immediately.)<p>On top of that, there are serious performance issues with the built-in Japanese IME, although I&#x27;m not completely sure how much of this is new, and I experienced a bug where WindowServer would randomly start hogging CPU, which may or may not be related to said IME.<p>Given all these problems, I&#x27;m surprised that the general consensus seems to be that the performance is good.  But maybe I&#x27;m somehow a special case.  (The Safari issue is the most egregious - is it that many OS X users don&#x27;t use Safari in the first place?)",1413518398

8469338,comment,8464532,8466166,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Note that one important reason why Piketty wants a wealth tax is that this would lead to much higher quality data on the wealth distribution (I haven&#x27;t read the book, but he says so very clearly in his TED talk).<p>The problem with this argument is that it&#x27;s based in the same fantasy land where people always report all of their out of state and internet purchases to their state of residence and pay sales tax on them.<p>> Frankly, this sounds much too alarmist. First of all, the talk is always about a <i>progressive</i> wealth tax in the first place. That is, few people would be affected by the highest tier.<p>That actually makes it worse. All the bad still applies to the people in the highest tier, but then you have the incentive to create criminal conspiracies for the purposes of tax avoidance, because putting assets in the name of someone with fewer assets will dramatically lower the tax rate. This creates a highly profitable arbitrage opportunity except for the fact that it would presumably be illegal, leaving an opportunity for criminal enterprise to step in.<p>> Second, if you think about the steady state, it&#x27;s clear that wealth up to the level of the highest tier of taxation wouldn&#x27;t be accumulated in the first place.<p>> My intuition for this comes from income taxes: During the time when highest marginal rates were much higher than today, executives didn&#x27;t bother bargaining for the ridiculously high salaries that they get today, and so few people really paid those highest rates.<p>Those numbers are very misleading. The times when the highest marginal tax rates were higher also had dramatically different tax codes. In particular, &quot;benefits&quot; largely weren&#x27;t taxed, so instead of a higher salary you would be provided with an expensive company car and whatever else necessary to provide the required level of compensation. It&#x27;s the same principle as the existing corporate income tax: High nominal rates but the majority of large corporations don&#x27;t pay those rates because there are widely known ways to avoid them.<p>It was also much more common back then for the executives to be the owners or their friends/relatives, so their &quot;salaries&quot; were only coming out of their own pockets anyway.<p>> Yes, people would try to evade taxes, but they are already doing this today.<p>Because the taxes we have today are also poorly conceived. What you want is a tax which applies to a very broad base and is difficult to avoid. VAT acquits itself very well on that front.<p>> And if you&#x27;re worried about people renouncing citizenship: I think we should grow a pair and get serious about exit taxes.<p>Exit taxes are hopeless. Even putting aside how easy they are to avoid, the incentive that creates for the owners of growing businesses is extremely perverse: Renounce your citizenship now before you get any bigger and owe even more.<p>> As a final thought, the idea of using a VAT to finance a basic income is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t help against wealth inequality, because poor people generally spend a much higher fraction of their disposable income on stuff on which VAT is paid.<p>This is a common flaw in thinking about taxation. What you spend the money on is just as important as how you raise it. Taking $50 from someone with a thousand dollars and $10 from someone with a hundred dollars but then giving them each $30 back is progressive notwithstanding that the effective tax rate on the person with a thousand dollars is much lower. At the end of the day the person who started with $100 now has $120 and the extra $20 came out of the pocket of the person with a thousand dollars. &quot;Effective tax rate&quot; is a totally meaningless number without &quot;effective government benefits.&quot;<p>Comparing this to the current so-called progressive system is illuminating. For example, if a person making $500K makes an extra $5000 then they pay $1750 in taxes but don&#x27;t lose eligibility for any benefits they were previously eligible for. If a person making $25K makes an extra $5000 then they pay $750 in taxes but also lose eligibility for more than $1000/year in need-based programs. In practical effect the marginal rate on the person making $25K is <i>higher</i>. Depending on what (and how many) programs they were previously eligible for, the rate can actually exceed 100% by simultaneously eliminating eligibility for multiple independent programs.",1413517563

But the reason I&#x27;m using this write strategy (advancing output by a variable) is to avoid branch prediction errors by converting a jump table to a conditional move. Often (half the time?) I can&#x27;t figure out a way to get the intrinsics to produce the assembly I want, much less across all three of those compilers.  Combining the intrinsics with the conditional moves is what requires the inline assembly.<p>Other places this comes up are addressing modes, operands that work directly on memory, and register allocation.  For example, Haswell is capable of doing 2 loads and a store in a single cycle, but only if the store address is a &quot;simple&quot; base plus offset (no indexing). Convincing a compiler to produce a particular addressing mode is somewhat like teaching a blind person to drive a stick shift while you too are wearing a blindfold. Particularly if you are optimizing for a particular processor (and don&#x27;t need to support Windows), inline assembly is considerably more reliable than depending on a compiler to consistently generate sane code.",1413516609

Their big marketing angle was that HPC programmers could just use their existing OpenMP x86 code. This shows how Intel had no idea in what they&#x27;re getting into, because accelerator programming needs to deal with different problems than on the CPU, regardless of whether you have a simple CUDA core or a MIC x86 [1]. Results have so far been rather poor because of that. Kepler GPUs with CUDA support are for that reason still the best tooled accelerators for HPC programming.<p>[1] First of all, when you need on the order of thousands to tens of thousands of threads to saturate your cores, memory becomes a big issue again. Your threads have maybe 400k usable memory. Memory bandwidth is usually even a more important limitation - these systems have 2-3 times less bandwidth per physical thread than CPUs. This can be mitigated using a programming model that uses bandwidth very efficiently (e.g. stream programming like in CUDA, OpenCL) - an area where GPUs are traditionally more advanced, since they deal with this limitation since a long time. Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, Intel will probably catch up at some point.",1413516487

In data-flow programming (e.g. FRP), non-local data-flow is a big no no, while non-local non-contiguous control-flow rules the day but is completely encapsulated (programmers only manipulate data flow via wiring, control flow is inferred).<p>> I suspect that the distinction between traditional control-flow-heavy programming languages and static-data-flow end-user languages plays a big part in that learning curve.<p>This is a guess, but I don&#x27;t really see it. A cook can definitely follow a recipe, or even write one for others to read, which involves lots of control flow.

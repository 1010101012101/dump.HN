That creates something of a toxic mix.  So why not stick to discussing what we know best?   That would be in keeping with the principle of comparative advantage:-)",1209797778

Sheetz is famous in the area for having really decent food, orderable through little kiosks at every store.<p>They pretty well own their niche at least in the area I'm familiar with.  They're a good example of a business entering a saturated market (gas stations) but doing it better than everyone else to the point that most people that I know will go out of their way to go to a Sheetz rather than any other gas station.<p>Typically, they have their gas just a little below the average in the area, surcharge free ATMs, the Made-To-Order kiosks (sometimes located at the gas pumps), clean bathrooms, and a bit of a more friendly atmosphere than other gas stations.<p>They're actually a rather good example for startups.",1209794437

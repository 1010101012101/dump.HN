There are bunch of proposals, from tweaks to the mandatory reporting rules (what this seems to be), all the way to allowing shareholders a direct vote on executive pay (the so-called &quot;say on pay&quot; [1]). Though you could certainly argue that this particular rule isn&#x27;t a very effective means for shareholders to get control over executive pay; at best it seems like it will give them an occasionally-useful PR tool to pressure boards into restraining executive pay.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Say_on_pay"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Say_on_pay</a>",1438801157

The JVM loads a large number of largeish class files when it starts; these contain implementations of the standard library and whatever else is on your classpath that you&#x27;ve imported. These have the nice property that they&#x27;re read-only, though, so multiple JVM processes can safely share them. When you move to sandboxing each JVM off by itself, you lose the ability for them to share memory (which is, in a sense, a _feature_ of sandboxing), so now each of them has to take the 50-100MB hit of those formerly-shared memory regions.<p>(Note that the huge size of the classes is also the big reason why JVM startup time is so crap; another reason that multitenant JVM systems are great is that every process after the first starts much faster)",1438801070

10011969,comment,9994899,9999763,0,0,klibertp,,,"> Is that really true?<p>Yes, I believe so. And it has nothing to do with genius!<p>First: of course you wouldn&#x27;t be able to get senior dev positions in a domain you never worked in. You have to be prepared for this. Pay cut is obvious just after the change, and you need to decide if you can afford it.<p>Second: it&#x27;s a matter of how long you&#x27;re going to stay junior in your new domain. In practice, this is a question of how solid your foundations are and how experienced you are already, and also how determined you are. I believe in what jwz said in &quot;Coders at Work&quot;: different domains have different vocabularies, best practices, and myths, but deep down it&#x27;s still just standard coding. There are variables and loops and branching constructs everywhere, no matter the domain.<p>> there are genius programmers who are equally competent at embedded systems, mobile development, distributed systems...<p>I doubt there are many people who are competent in many domains <i>at once</i>. There <i>are</i> such people out there and they&#x27;re very expensive specialists. Still nothing to do with genius, but rather hard to achieve. However, you don&#x27;t need to be like that: you just need to change the domain, not master a new one while retaining all your skills specific to the previous domain.<p>The two most important things for making a switch are your foundations and experience. In your example - embedded dev - you&#x27;d need to have a good prior understanding of how CPUs work plus knowledge of C and Asm. Given this you&#x27;re almost immediately ready to code, after maybe a week of reading the codebase, manuals, and refreshing AT&T asm syntax (for example). You - every programmer, really - <i>should</i> know at least the basics of such things from college or self-study.<p>The experience is important because it gives you an intuition as to where the potential problems and hurdles in your learning would be. More than anything, experience provides you with an essential skill, a systematic (working for you) way of assessing and learning a new technology. It&#x27;s much easier to change your domain for the fifth time than it is for the first time. Even if the previous areas you worked in have nothing to do with the one you&#x27;re learning right now.<p>For me, programming is a lifelong career choice. That means I have ~50 years of programming still ahead of me. I can&#x27;t imagine working for such a long time in a single domain! In a bit more than a decade of my professional programming, I already switched domains four times. Despite the fact that I&#x27;m self-taught, and my foundations were lacking for quite some time. (I like to believe I fixed this after a couple of years.) It wasn&#x27;t easy, but if I did it, then I&#x27;m sure almost anyone can :-)",1438800930

  He will not see me stopping here

  My little horse must think it queer
  To stop without a farmhouse near
  Between the woods and frozen lake
  The darkest evening of the year.

  He gives his harness bells a shake
  To ask if there is some mistake.
  The only other sound’s the sweep
  Of easy wind and downy flake.

  The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
  But I have promises to keep,
  And miles to go before I sleep,
  And miles to go before I sleep.

I am productive though and have found little tricks that have helped me personally.<p>1. If I am working on a large project I try to keep it split into very small pieces. I only work on a small piece at a time and switch between pieces often. This keeps my mind going. It also helps if you start to get stuck and lose focus by looking things up or just outright losing interest in what you are working on. By breaking it into small pieces you tend to complete more items and it tricks your mind into staying focused (at least for me). As someone else pointed out, a big time suck for developers is having to look things up. If I know that I want to get 20 things done in a day, I will work to get as many as possible done before I get stuck having to look something up. Sometimes I find that doing other things will freshen my mind and I no longer need to look it up.<p>2. If I find myself getting stuck or losing focus, I get up immediately and do something else non-work related. I may go for a 15-20 minute walk, grab a cup of coffee, or read HN.<p>3. I try to go to sleep at, or around, the same time every night and try to wake up at, or around, the same time every day. Being in a routine helps.<p>4. Watch what you eat/drink. I used to drink a couple beers every night, smoke, and drank a lot of soda. I stopped drinking 2 years ago (I still have a beer every now and then at events or with dinner on occasion), I quit smoking (been a year now), and gave up soda entirely (haven&#x27;t had one in 3 years). Combined with exercising more and watching what I eat I have found this alone the biggest improvement to my staying focused and being productive. I also used to eat late at night, which didn&#x27;t help my sleep cycle and also is bad for your health in general. I forced myself to get on a more routine diet, or at least eating cycle.",1438800390

Even more are available on Slackbuilds.org (see below).<p>* Most (if not all) Slackware software packages include development headers (unlike most GNU/Linux distributions which have separate `-dev` packages for development headers), making it <i>very</i> convenient if you need to develop against some library.<p>* The underlying system is simple and easy to troubleshoot; no plethora of fragile moving parts like you see in OS X or Ubuntu.<p>* Ships with the full GCC suite.<p>* Fast.<p>* Things &quot;just work&quot;.<p>* Compatible with a lot of different language runtimes/compilers/etc. (for me, I&#x27;ve seen Erlang/Elixir, Ruby (w/ RVM), Perl, Rust, Julia, and assorted other LLVM-oriented languages work out-of-the-box without needing to deviate from `./configure && make && sudo make install`; not that you <i>have</i> to even `./configure && make && sudo make install`, though (see below)).<p>* Plethora of third-party software packages available on Slackbuilds.org (installation of which is automatable if you download/install `sbopkg`).<p>It&#x27;s not for everyone, of course, but it&#x27;s worked well for me over the last several years.",1438800263

10011860,comment,10011531,10011531,0,0,kom107,,,"Little bit of background as to why I think I can answer this: Three years ago, I ran my own web design/development/marketing company, doing a lot of the front end UI/UX stuff, as well as the marketing plans for my clients.  I did this, worked another full time job, voluntered 15 hours a week, and was taking 21 credits a semester.  After that, for a year, I commuted 5 hours each way to attend a weekend post-baccalaureate medical program (full time) while working in a hospital full time (actually averaged 51 hours a week).  Now, I&#x27;m a senior systems analyst with the same healthcare organization, I have a wife and 2 year old daughter, I&#x27;m working on my startup, and my manager and others are often commenting on how amazed they are at how much I get done, and I love my work-life balance.  I don&#x27;t feel like anyone is short-changed.<p>So what&#x27;s my dirty little secret?  Three simple things: I keep a to-do list, the items on the list are incredibly clear and take, at max, 2 hours, and finally, I switch gears if I have to wait on other people (i.e. I don&#x27;t surf the net while I wait for an email to approve workflow, I simply switch to another item on my to do list)<p>I am INCREDIBLY focused on execution, and if I have a task that I know can cause my mind to wander, I limit the amount of time I spend on it (for example, I have research potential repository structures, 1 hour, on my to do list right now).<p>I used to write things like &#x27;redo startup website&#x27; on my to-do lists years ago.  Now it&#x27;s &#x27;1. rewrite main copy on landing page to highlight x feature 2. rewrite faq to include a, b, c questions. 3. change contact form to say &#x27;sign up&#x27;, reset analytics&#x27;.  Make your tasks granular, tactical, and limit the time frame.  I also start my day with a maximum of 6 things on the to-do list, and I rank them based on priority.  As I start to cross things off the list, I add more to the next day (or for later that day if I am finishing things faster than I had anticipated).  Finally, before I go to bed at night, I make sure I have 6 items on my to do list for the next day, so I can hit the ground running.<p>Plan ahead.  Break it down.  Prioritize.  Write things down.  Regardless of what you do for a living, or where you are in life, you can definitely use this method to improve your productivity.  Good luck!",1438800192

I prefer using the Eisenhower Matrix. Prioritizing also includes delegating and eliminating tasks.<p>* Start waking up earlier (like 5:30). It&#x27;s quiet, there&#x27;s few distractions, and it&#x27;s empowering to get a ton done and then realize it&#x27;s not even noon yet.<p>* Decide what your Most Important Task (MIT) is and do that first thing in the morning (important!)<p>* Make your tasks specific and actionable. Not &quot;Study for exam,&quot; but &quot;Review chapter 2 notes on X section.&quot; You can also break tasks down until it sounds stupid, but much easier to do.<p>* Batch similar or small tasks together and set a time to do them<p>* Schedule your day on a calendar. If it doesn&#x27;t go on, it doesn&#x27;t get done. You don&#x27;t have to get super specific with tasks. Just block out chunks of time to do work. Also schedule your breaks and your not-working times (important!)<p>* I like listening to background sounds. Either classical music or using Coffitivity/Noisli.

It has some quirks, and some down right awful parts. But they are easily avoided, and often can be automatically detected by static analysis tools like JSLint, JSHint, etc.<p>Lexically scoped anonymous functions, closures, first-class functions, immediately invoked function expressions, object literals, dynamic objects, are all magical once you twist your brain into really understand how to program in that paradigm.<p>And yes, other programming languages have combinations of these features and maybe implement them better. But if you look at the other most popular programming languages (<a href=""http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index....</a>) JavaScript is really it for this sort of dynamic, functional-esque style programming.<p>And popularity matters when you are looking for support, documentation, or libraries to interact with other systems.<p>Secondly, asynchronous event driven programming is a truly powerful model. And while you can do event driven programming in any language. Node.js treats it as a first class citizen, with it&#x27;s standard lib implemented as non-blocking with callbacks.<p>But what really makes Node.js so awesome is the marriage of it&#x27;s dynamic nature with the event driven model. They just work so well together. Passing functions as callbacks for events just works so elegantly compared to how&#x27;d you have to do that in other languages. Building out constructs like promises or event emitters is trivial because JavaScript is so flexible.<p>I think Node.js gets shoehorned into doing a lot of work where maybe it doesn&#x27;t make sense.

But my experience--and I&#x27;ve written plenty of Go, though I find it unpleasant to write and think about for all the usual reasons that Go partisans roll their eyes and so would rather deal with it as artifacts rather than actually writing it--has led to watching lots of developers make mudball codebases in the process (while blogging very heavily about how great it is three weeks in, and less a year-plus in). A pursuit of faux-simplicity has led to what I see as reinventing a lot of Java-1.4-era (because the language itself is essentially that) design patterns--and we should be reminded that design patterns exist to address defects in tooling--that more expressive languages have managed to avoid; the general desire for smaller applications helps to some extent, but software has this tendency to grow that I don&#x27;t think Go gives you the tools to effectively manage and maintain. Reasonable minds can differ, of course.<p>Past that, while I think it&#x27;s an alright choice for company-internal deployable products--web servers, worker nodes, etc.--I have straight-up problems with it being the new devops tool of choice. Statically linking your SSL library makes you an asshole when it inevitably fails and now an application has to be regression-tested so that new features and new bugs don&#x27;t hose you just because that&#x27;s the only way to upgrade Heartbleed 2.0. (Go also discourages program extensibility through components and rather as recompilation; the stuff Packer and Terraform do to provide &quot;plugins&quot; that the same company&#x27;s Vagrant just did with a `require` is gross and, to my mind, completely foolish.)<p>So I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s <i>hype</i>, but I would say it&#x27;s not all <i>true</i>, either.",1438799366

Then we do a dot-product between this and the vector <1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7>. The result will be a multiple of 9.<p>If we choose the vector as <1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1> we get the straight sum of the digits.   If we choose <100000, 10000, 1000, 100, 10, 1> we get 142857, and so on.<p>Here is why it works:<p><pre><code>   10**<whatever> x == x (mod 9).
</code></pre>
That is to say, any integer x is congruent, modulo 9, to a power of 10 times that integer.<p>For instance 4 mod 9 == 4.  40 mod 9 == 4.   400 mod 9 == 4.<p>And the reason for that is that 10 is 9 + 1; i.e. 10 is congruent to 1 modulo 9. So we are really multiplying by 1 under the congruence.<p>So the choices of powers of ten in the coefficient vector do not matter.<p>It works in other bases. For instance if any integer x is multiplied by a power of 6, that is congruent to x, modulo 5:<p><pre><code>  $ clisp -q
  [1]> (mod (* 2) 5)
  2
  [2]> (mod (* 6 2) 5)
  2
  [3]> (mod (* 6 6 2) 5)
  2
  [4]> (mod (* 6 6 6 2) 5)
  2
</code></pre>
Elementary number theory, my dear Watson.<p>Okay, I now wrapped my hackerly head around this enough that I can garbage collect it away as fairly uninteresting.<p>:)<p>But, one more thing: what is special about 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7 in connection to 9? Why, they are relatively prime to 9.  The remaining three positive residues in the mod 9 congruence are not: 0, 3 and 6.<p>See here: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function</a><p>Euler&#x27;s totient function phi counts the number of such integers.  phi(9) == 6 (there are six of these numbers for 9).

If we start from &quot;splitting the [heavy] atom&quot;, the first practical method, a German radiochemist was the first to recognize what happened, and the German physicist he first forwarded this information and her nephew figured out how it worked.  But those two were Jews in exile, and most of the following more practical stuff was figured out, correctly at least, by scientists outside of Germany.  Inside, they suffered a couple of disasters, a silly failure to get an higher priority for the project, and an incorrect evaluation of using graphite as a moderator, limiting them to heavy water.  Which we made sure through sabotage that they couldn&#x27;t get more/enough of.<p>But if you put on your alternate history cap, note Heisenberg and Himmer&#x27;s relationship from when they were school kids, direct all the V-2 resources into the bomb, who knows?

Then you only have 3 things to do instead of 300. Small hack but works great to not feel overwhelmed.<p>2. Practice your focus and willpower so that you can stay on one item at a time and not feel like you need to check FB/email/etc every 5 minutes. For some people this is really hard, but it is a skill you can improve.<p>3. Figure out the fastest, easiest and most efficient way to do things and then do it that way. This covers everything from the commute to coding and project management.<p>4. If your office is driving you crazy, schedule &quot;meetings&quot; on your calendar to block out dedicated work times. Put your headphones on. If people still don&#x27;t get the hint, tell them you are busy working on x right now and can talk to them in an hour.<p>5. Most importantly, work when you are working and live when you are not. I don&#x27;t check my email on weekends. People have my phone number and if something is important they will text me.

Answer: <i>Extraordinarily invested.</i>  They have a whole lot of code written in it, most of which the world will never hear about, and which powers services that they will continue running until the sun goes nova.  Google will likely continue maintaining and extending Go programs (as well as C++, Java, and Python) for the foreseeable future.<p>Question #2: Can Go survive without Google&#x27;s corporate backing?  Answer: Go is an OSS project.  Like many OSS projects, it receives a substantial amount of support from corporate interests.  Go is not uniquely a Google priority -- many organizations like having a systems programming language which has its feature set.  In the absence of meaningful support from Google, Go code existing as of August 2015 would continue to function.

Lets take two good examples that are part of what is going on in golang today.<p>Vendoring: The core teams approach, and what the community are doing have diverged pretty rapidly. Recently there have been some efforts bring vendoring into alignment, but what is being used isn&#x27;t the best approach/solution, its good but on the whole could be better.<p>http: The core library is great if you want something small, and its fairly easy to put together a tool chain that will remain &quot;idiomatic&quot;. However if your going to go out and build something &quot;large&quot; then you have an interesting issue, because OOTB core http lacks any concept of context. There are some interesting tools and frameworks out there to make up for this (gorilla/context, codegangsta/negroni) but if you adopt them your no longer &quot;idiomatic&quot;... your libraries are now less reusable because they are tightly coupled. It looks like a new method signature is going to be required in the http package, one that uses golang.org/x/net/context and returns errors so we can have a sane http stack OOTB in go....<p>Log vs syslog: Logging in go is fairly messy right now... there are a bunch of packages that try to make up for this, but really better logging has to be built into the core. Syslog has levels/features, log is just dry and basic (maybe too much so). The core not only needs a unified solution, but one that is going to be context aware.<p>Will these get fixed? Probably! The core team isn&#x27;t deaf. However if they don&#x27;t start moving on a path to 2.0 soon and address some of the real issues, I fear that go will end up in the same boat that python did in 2.x vs 3.x.<p>P.S. in spite of all this I have been writing a LOT of go lately and enjoying it, but it really does need to grow and soon!",1438798915

Like it&#x27;s not possible that a relatively new linux distribution that has just undergone a major overhaul of its package management system might still have bugs or issues.<p>No. NixOS is perfect for everyone today. Just completely rewrite every deploy script you have from the ground up. Having trouble? Don&#x27;t worry! The documentation is &quot;getting better.&quot;<p>>  Your scripts should be part of a package. I don&#x27;t know about Nix, but in Guix we have a build step that patches shebangs to remove the nasty /usr/bin things and replace them with references to the right executables in the store.<p>Sorry, but I will not be writing an OS-integration package for every specific software deploy during development. It&#x27;s unlikely to even imply that I should be doing this during development just to get off the ground. I tried to use NixOS as an environment for development for Golang and Java and found it frustratingly at odds with all existing tooling. The only languages I found that seemed well supported was haskell and C, and I don&#x27;t ship code on either of those platforms anymore.<p>It was <i>doubly</i> unlikely early this year. The documentation was in utter disrepair and more than two Nix developers told me on twitter, &quot;It is very difficult to do unless you are a contributor.&quot; It was also the case that many pre-existing packages were done incorrectly, still suffering these problems. Golang&#x27;s package was one of them.<p>>  but that has no bearing on whether or not you can run the resulting binaries on another machine.<p>Copying a closure to deploy software projects currently in development is an extremely intensive step, and many packages had outstanding bugs that don&#x27;t do this.<p>Furthermore, existing deploy tools like Puppet, Salt and Ansible all have extreme difficulties managing this model, but Nix (at least at the time I examined it) didn&#x27;t offer very good tools for actually distributing said closures in a cloud services environment.<p>> Container images are not reproducible. You and I can build an image from the same Dockerfile and I guarantee that the checksums would be different.<p>It&#x27;s not the responsibility of the <i>dockerfile</i> to maintain this immutability. It&#x27;s the responsibility of the environment the dockerfile is executed in.<p>Which is probably why Golang was specifically such a problem, it has a really miserable story for actually making reproducible builds with locked deps.<p>Given a specific git SHA for a project with locked dependencies, it is absolutely reproducible and will produce the same image SHAs every time.<p>P.S., at the time NixOS was going through a major update and it was possible to install a version of Nix onto NixOS that was not entirely compatible. This ruined the install while still using Nix commands. If that bug has been fixed, great, but it was a known issue and I was not the only person in IRC asking for help with it.

My team and I have been wrangling with the compliant systems and services out there for handling this problem too. The crux really lies in the logistics of the HIPAA standard as every healthcare service storing or transmitting patient information must comply with _at least_ these regulations. Each hospital is liable to run their own EHR system which makes it extremely hard to integrate directly with them in a single broad stroke.<p>> Am I right to assume that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to set up a cloud database that is accessed directly from, say, the OR of a hospital?<p>It depends on you, the employees, and the hospital. HIPAA basically focuses on 3 factors for securing and storing sensitive data: (1) Physical data security, (2) Security of data in transit, and (3) Training of personnel with access to the data. Amazon has HIPAA services that handle (1), 3rd party services like you mentioned above or you can handle yourself for (2), and also 3rd party services or yourself can handle (3). Assuming you have (1) and (2) squared away, and assuming the employees in the OR have the proper training, there should be no compliance violation.",1438797835
10011598,comment,10003329,10003712,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"You are re-iterating a position which is currently under a lot of debate. There are two components here:<p>1) Model Aircraft (your first FAA link) are not &quot;Aircraft&quot; in the sense of operating under the rules and regulations of private aircraft or commercial aircraft.<p>2) Within the definitions of personal property, the owner has rights about what they can and cannot do to other property that intrudes on that space.<p>So in the 2nd case, if a &quot;toy&quot; (aka Model Aircraft) was on their property intentionally (which is to say the owner put it there), there is a bunch of case law that says that can impound it or do what ever they want with it. From errant baseballs breaking windows to toy airplanes (or rockets) which land on their land. Further the owner is liable for any damage it does. So in that regard the landowner was well within their rights to &quot;shoot&quot;[1] a toy airplane out of the sky above their house if they felt threatened. The means employed, a shotgun, only has an effective range of about 250&#x27; so by definition the flying vehicle was within the 400&#x27; exclusion zone. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it was a $1500 quad-copter drone or a $1.50 balsa wood wind up airplane.<p>But then there is the whole question of police usage and surveillance. So for a police unit to be lawfully surveilling you under the 400&#x27; limit they need a warrant (currently). Its possible it extends farther than that given opinions like this one [1].

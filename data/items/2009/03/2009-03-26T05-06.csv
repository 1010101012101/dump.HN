I took the day off yesterday and got more done than I have the previous eight or ten nights after work. It's not that I don't make progress on evenings and weekends, but there's no replacement for eight, ten, twelve hours where you really get into the hard stuff. I rarely work straight through for that long, so it's not just a result of having more time. It's more about being able to focus solely on one project (and one that I love). On July 11 I'm going full time and will get to do that every day.",1238047123

And after WW2, the US opposed Mao by supporting the losing side.  The USSR supported Mao's revolution.  Trade began between China and the US in the 70's but it was not part of a plan to defeat the soviet union.  It only really picked up at the end of the cold war.<p>I don't think Japan is being usurped.  If and when the re-unification happens, it will be chaos.  South Korea just hopes it does not bankrupt them.  Having a new source of inexpensive labor will not help Korea surpass Japan.  China is close by and there is still plenty of inexpensive labor to be had there.<p>Also, its not like just Japan uses Chinese manufacturing.  The whole world does including the US.  Japans engineering head-start was not given to them by the Marshall plan(which was mostly directed at europe).  They earned it starting in the 50's.",1238046881

Interestingly, many ""facts and figures' regarding global warming completely ignore the powerful effects of water vapor in the greenhouse system, carelessly (perhaps, deliberately) overstating human impacts as much as 20-fold.<p>Water vapor is 99.999% of natural origin. Other atmospheric greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and miscellaneous other gases (CFC's, etc.), are also mostly of natural origin (except for the latter, which is mostly anthropogenic).<p>Human activites contribute slightly to greenhouse gas concentrations through farming, manufacturing, power generation, and transportation. However, these emissions are so dwarfed in comparison to emissions from natural sources we can do nothing about, that even the most costly efforts to limit human emissions would have a very small-- perhaps undetectable-- effect on global climate.",1238045496

There's an inherent expectation that you aren't a user who wants just the ""shallow"" common-case uses, but instead are going to go through a rite of passage where you learn the ins and outs of all the concepts the tool uses, make it part of your daily life, and piece it together with the other small powerful tools into some conglomeration that solves your problem.<p>This is great for developers, but bad for end-users, as a lot of users will run away before learning new concepts(they're busy enough already), while others will take a macho posturing attitude towards it and look down on the people who ran away. The community gets polarized. Git exemplifies this kind of thing, for better or for worse.<p>It's not a huge surprise that so many developers have switched from Linux to OSX, since the latter has made many more provisions towards the newbie end-user; it indicates that most developers don't want to take on this kind of burden, at least not all the time.",1238044365

Also, as I said before, once you pass the seed stage, it's easier (but not valley easy) to get the $1M you mention in ""Can you Buy a Silicon Valley"". It will help long term.<p>Basically, if we could at least get the ease of raising seed funding in Atlanta at parity with the ease of raising 1st round for a startup with revenues, it would be a significant win for us.<p>I do agree with you that if there were more VCs funding at the $1M level in Atlanta, we could keep all the Shotput applicants here and maybe a bunch of startups would move from across the country to Atlanta. But since politicians are unlikely to be as enlightened as making the $1B investment you mention in your essay would require, we'll have to attract private investors. If 1 of those 4 startups has a big successful exit, we'll probably get 1 more large fund to come to Atlanta.",1238043628

(Obviously some contracts are intentionally short - but I would definitely describe a very short contract on my CV as being more of a &quot;project&quot; than an actual contract.)",1415624379

Not talking about extreme poverty here, the following is what I&#x27;ve learned:<p>More money leads in almost all people to artificial value, short term superficial happiness, degradation of the soul. On the outside it looks great and shiny, but on the inside the soul starves and craves true happiness. Unfortunately, most rich people react unconsciously by spending more and more, in a desperate effort to fill the ever growing gap.<p>Longer term less money creates in almost all people higher valuation of the most simple and basic things, which translates to true happiness for the soul. Less money can restore happiness if people are willing.<p>But there is of course a lot more affected by the money in our lives, especially the ego. A rich men easily thinks he is really someone, a &#x27;great&#x27; man, special, gifted, etc.. The poor man will most often struggle with the opposite thoughts and feelings, while in the end it&#x27;s all false.<p>If I ever again have quite some money to spend, I&#x27;ll be very vigilant, you&#x27;ll see me desperately trying to hold myself back. Never trade your soul for money (or power) is my advice. And if you have a lot of it, use a substantial part to help poor children for example, give them food, education, that will create you some ever lasting happiness, at least, if you can hold yourself back from growing your ego on that.",1415623079

But if Wal-Mart wants to use the card associations&#x27; infrastructure, then Wal-Mart has to play by the card associations&#x27; rules.<p>The whole point of &quot;CurrentC&quot;, as I understand it, is to launch and build out a competing infrastructure which bypasses the card associations entirely, most especially their transaction fee schedules.<p>I can understand why merchants would want to do that; from the association perspective, there is absolutely no reason to do anything <i>other than</i> putting the entire cost of the transaction on the merchant, because asking the customer to pay into the scheme is a disincentive for using plastic at all -- which means that, from the merchant perspective, accepting plastic entails taking a bath on the transaction fees in exchange for not losing all the customers who won&#x27;t do business at a cash-only till. Which, these days, is most of them, exclusive of special cases like a farmer&#x27;s market or a flea market, where everybody expects to pay cash -- though, thanks to Square, Stripe, and friends, even that&#x27;s changing.<p>(This, were you wondering, is the genesis both of the &quot;credit card minimum $10&quot; signs you see at shoestring gas stations, and the rule in the associations&#x27; merchant agreements which prohibits merchants from setting such minima. The sign comes about because transaction fees often mean a merchant loses money on very small credit card transactions, and the rule follows because merchants setting such minima costs the associations part of the fee income which they consider their due.)<p>It makes good sense, then, for merchants, especially big merchants like Wal-Mart who pay the associations more than anyone, to band together and try to launch a competitor to the existing scheme. Of course, it would help if they could show signs of being able to mount a serious challenge, and so far such signs are sorely lacking, which might explain some of the bitterness evident in Cook&#x27;s mien on the subject.<p>Like it or not, though, the card associations are the 800-pound gorilla in the field; counting their predecessor organizations, they&#x27;ve spent over half a century establishing themselves, and to expect them to be anything other than fiercely protective of such investment would be foolish.<p>I&#x27;m not sure whether the people making decisions under the &quot;MCX&quot; banner have failed to recognize the scope of what they&#x27;re trying to do, or whether they&#x27;ve simply failed to execute on a level sufficient to mount a credible challenge -- but, either way, they haven&#x27;t done anything worth taking seriously, and I doubt they ever will. This leaves them with the same choice they&#x27;ve had for decades now: whether to go on paying a vig to the card associations, or instead to stop taking plastic and lose all the customers such a decision will entail. Sucks, sure, but, as ever, mere pissing and moaning changes nothing.",1415623027

We were quite poor, and both purchases were a monumental event, made possible by unexpected windfalls. I shudder to think what would have happened if they broke prematurely, or the circumstances which led to them being purchased never came about.<p>Certainly my career would have been set back many years (I released my first commercial game - though it made little money - at 15).<p>I was fortunate enough to be a &quot;have&quot;, and get the opportunity to learn computing from an early age. I&#x27;m a digital native. My proximity to the line of separation makes me think quite a bit about how much worse my life would be without that initial investment. Especially while I&#x27;m playing the guitar, which I picked up and enjoy playing badly as an adult (with the money I made from computing), but didn&#x27;t have access to as a kid. If my talents were in music rather than computing, I&#x27;d be flipping burgers right now.<p>It&#x27;s amazing to me that in this day and age you can get a computer good enough to do serious work on <i>for the price of my last meal</i>. You could learn to program, get contract work, and complete that work entirely from a Raspberry Pi (and a TV or second hand monitor, kb/mouse etc).<p>The dropping of the price of entry level computing has been happening for some time, but we really are to the point that no western kid is missing out due to the cost alone (there are unfortunately still other reasons). Computing has long celebrated its meritocratic nature, but being meritocratic for the middle class and up wasn&#x27;t ever really something to be proud of. I&#x27;m pretty sure by that yardstick yacht racing is meritocratic, too.<p>The world will be such a rich place when each child has the ability to thoroughly search the space of what is potentially interesting to them, and have the means, encouragement and material available to pursue it while they are free from the constraints of adult life. I think we&#x27;re making great progress there, and it&#x27;s one of the only aspects of how we are progressing into the future that I am unreservedly excited about.<p>As countries get wealthier and costs continue to fall, the trend will continue globally. I fully expect to end my career being thoroughly outclassed by ultra talented new kids on the block from Cambodia and Ethiopia, born in a decade or two, and nothing could make me happier.

I can do that partly by e.g. &#x27;:!python -i -c &quot;whatever&quot;&#x27; but it&#x27;s not really integrated.<p>I also love to do &quot;other&quot; things in text files instead of websites, because text files allow you to do anything with it. Automated tasks, reformatting, compiling to other formats like diagrams, storing in the cloud, or a repo, or simply adding it to an email. I don&#x27;t see why I need plugins or special modes for it, though. I think that&#x27;s more an argument for learning text editors in general. No matter if you use vim, emacs, sublime, or maybe atom, in any case you gain a huge advantage over people who can only be efficient inside a huge IDE or their web browsers.<p>The other things like debugging, documentation generation, etc are in my eyes not tasks for a text editor. I expect to do that in the shell and it works there. Jumping to definitions is possible in Vim btw. Under the hood it integrates with ctags which is a typical tool to index code definitions, I think (or does it only exist for vim?).<p>The git example, in my eyes, is perfect for what I meant, though. You can&#x27;t do some things as directly or easily with &quot;:!git&quot; but that also works the other way around. No plugin enables you to do everything you can do with &quot;:!git&quot; and I bet if you write git aliases for what you want to do, you can nearly be as efficient in the things the plugin can do. The added cost is that you need to write them yourself. The added gain is, that you learn to use git better and you can even use the aliases when you are not in vim.",1415621891

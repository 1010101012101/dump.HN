5428,comment,5249,5249,0,0,Readmore,,,"This is something that I've been interested in for awhile. I tried to set up a system that would target ads to users based on the information that I had in my own database instead of what was on a specific page. If your pages require a user to be logged in then the google bot can't access that data, so you get poor ads. It would be great if I could scan the data internally, then send a keyword request to Google, or whomever, and get back ads based on the information I sent. That way I can keep my users data private while still providing them high quality targeted ads. Does anyone know of an ad company that allows that?",1174494495

5426,comment,5409,5422,0,0,joshwa,,,"I think you'll see minimal impact on the landscape for publishers-- if they used CPA/aff before, they'll continue to use CPA-- Google is just another CPA source to them. Same with CPC. <p>The only shift I can imagine happening is that some CPC publishers will shift to CPA, as the overhead associated with evaluating the various affiliate brokers and opening accounts, etc, just got eliminated, as the publishers already have an existing relationship with Google.

5424,comment,5409,5418,0,0,joshwa,,,"It's true that the market has room for more than one player. It's just that if one of the players is Google, and since Google is offering significant integration advantages with Adwords  (see comment #4 on the techcrunch article), then CJ and Linkshare are going to lose serious market share. The ""800-lb gorilla"" title is going to shift overnight. They are in a pickle, to be sure. ",1174493675

5422,comment,5409,5420,0,0,python_kiss,,,"PPA is certainly a great relief for advertisers. An interesting question, though, is whether such an offering is actually beneficial to the publishers? Domain-parking sites, in particular, might fail to generate profits through PPA and therefore stick with CPC instead. This advertising model might fail to scale if it is not mutually beneficial for both, advertisers and the publishers.",1174493504

5420,comment,5409,5409,0,0,zkinion,,,"Yeah, this is nice.  The existing aff marketing networks are filled with all sorts of shysters.  Shaving sales and unjustified termination of accounts before payment is sent is very very very common.  This will put alot more honesty in the affiliate marketing area, which is a cesspool now.",1174493036

1618623,comment,1618196,1618589,0,0,grandalf,,,"You're taking the ""Going Galt"" concept out of context.  In the context of the book it's at the end of a long dystopian spiral.  The significance of it is that the characters have already been broken by the time they arrive there.<p>Frankly, the ending is a bit unsatisfactory on a few levels.  First, it's not a prescription for how to run a society (it's a small utopian community in the mountains) and yet the book ends quickly at that point so we're left wondering how it turned out.<p>It was necessary as a plot element, but it's really the denouement rather than the climax of the book.<p>I recommend you buy the unabridged audio version of the book and give it a read while driving, commuting, etc.  It has fairly good production quality and is a fairly effortless read on audio.<p>When I re-read it my reaction was that Rand uses some hyperbole in places where I (if I were the editor) would have recommended a slightly softer touch... but of course she is writing to the first time the reader encounters the story and she wants to be sure to lay down a solid plot foundation early so that the rest of the book can progress.<p>What I found remarkable about the book was that it's a pure novel of ideas.  One can only imagine (while drooling) how amazing it would be if all the world's great thinkers had written a few books of quality fiction to help illustrate their ideas.  So in my opinion Rand should get points added for the fiction work, not points subtracted.",1282251247

1618611,comment,1618203,1618268,0,0,wtallis,,,"Migrating to open standards is the right thing for Adobe to do, but that's not how Adobe likes to do business.<p>Adobe is lazy. If there's a problem with their software, they'll blame it on somebody else, because talk is cheap. If that doesn't work, they'll wait until the last possible moment to actually put in the time and effort to improve their code. It's a pattern that is most evident with their Mac software:<p>CS5 (released April 2010) was the first version of the suite that was fully Mac OS X native. (Mac OS X was released March 2001). Prior to CS5, they were still using the Mac OS 9 GUI APIs, which, though they weren't officially totally deprecated until June 2007, were obviously always just a transitional compatibility environment. Even prior to the official deprecation of the Carbon UI APIs, Adobe had plenty of reasons to port to Cocoa. Number one was to provide a truly OS X native look-and-feel, which is pretty much impossible to emulate via Carbon.<p>Adobe's approach to dealing with Flash performance on OS X has been similar. When people complained that video playback was unreasonably slow (ie eating up 5x the CPU time that a standalone player would use), they blamed Apple for not providing them with direct low-level access to the video decoding hardware. When Apple called their bluff and gave them exactly what they asked for, Adobe released a flash player that used those APIs but wasn't noticeably faster for anybody, and introduced several new glitches that made it a step backwards for everybody who's Mac predates the NVidia 9400M chipset.<p>On the Windows side of things, Adobe's PDF reader has been such a long-standing resource hog that third-party PDF readers have garnered significant market share in spite of their lack of support for most of the recent advanced features of PDF. If Adobe would take better care of their PDF implementation, it would be good for the progress of the format overall.<p>Further back, Adobe kept their font format (PostScript Type 1) proprietary and expensive so long that Apple had to create TrueType, and Apple ended up licensing it to Microsoft. Several years later, Adobe abandoned Type 1 in favor of co-developing a TrueType-based successor (OpenType) that is finally re-unifying the font market.<p>Adobe seems to think they're playing it safe by being the last rat off each sinking ship, but one of these days, they'll be too slow.",1282251081

1618583,comment,1617278,1618149,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"> There's a nice theory that this could be done with email, but the reality is that having meetings and reviewing documents via email tends to turn up different issues.<p>Why?<p>I have worked on developing technical review processes in more than one organisation, and spent many hours reading the books, studying the research and conducting practical trials. I have never encountered any evidence to suggest that everyone-sitting-there meetings are more productive than sending people copies of the material to check over in their own time and providing a sensible tool to record the findings.<p>On the contrary, my experience is that technical review processes often make fine examples of how to get meetings wrong. Calling a multi-hour, all-hands meeting every time something comes up for review seems to be as sure a guarantee as anything in life that your review process will fail and your staff will wind up with a permanent grudge against the very idea of reviews as a worthwhile use of their time.<p>That is because many issues raised during reviews are simple, and can be resolved simply and quickly between the reviewer who found the issue, the author of whatever is being reviewed, and possibly a small number of other reviewers who made the same or related observations. Making a wider group sit through dozens of typically short and bilateral discussions as you work down a list of every little point is enough to induce sleep even in the most dedicated and conscientious of participants.<p>Of course, there may be some issues that can't be resolved easily in this way. Perhaps discussion via e-mail/review tool/document comments/whatever is too inefficient for the number of reviewers/comments involved, or there are multiple people making related but subtly different points. <i>This</i> can lead to a productive meeting, but now you have both a specific point where a decision is needed and a clear list of interested parties to invite.",1282250589

You'd have to work around browser sandboxing that prevents access to the disk, but you can do that by installing as an extension. I think a JS-based torrent client is reasonable.<p>""New features"" is not a good answer; it might stave things off a bit longer, but the real problem in Flash is that Adobe is choking it to death and only really provides first-class support on Windows.<p>Only recently have they started taking even the Mac platform seriously, probably trying to prove to Apple that they should be included in the iOS devices. Support is still a complete mess on Linux (the basis of Android and countless other platforms and most new platforms, meaning that any day now a Linux-based platform could be the new hotness, supplanting the iPhone, and then we'll have to go through this whole song and dance again with Adobe pretending to take Linux seriously to try and trick people into letting Flash run on that platform with its 40% penetration), and their penguin.swf blog has nothing but excuses; sure, video on Linux may be less straightforward than video on Windows (because there is actual competition and you have to make a choice instead of taking whatever Microsoft decrees), but lots of people with far fewer resources have been able to deal with it, there's no reason Adobe can't.<p>That's the thing. Jobs says Flash has had its day because a few years ago Apple was the underdog that wasn't worth supporting. When Apple tried to work with Adobe, they were neglected and left to rot for ""higher profile"" projects. And now that Jobs and Apple have some real power, 10.1 magically gets filled with Mac-related fixes that should have been in at least half a decade earlier. And Jobs isn't buying it; in his mind, Adobe (correctly) is still the flippant and unresponsive bully who doesn't care about you until your market cap exceeds Microsoft's.<p>Nobody sane is going to hitch their star to Flash while Adobe lords over it. I understand, as do most of Adobe's recent customers, that Adobe is run by staunch old men who just don't get it, but someone really needs to help them get it, for the good of the web and the good of their company.",1282250441

I just get very anxious during in person interviews & I am not able to think straight at all. I could only give out answers to questions for which I knew the answers before hand. I am not good at deducing answers logically during interviews. For instance on my last interview, I was given a problem & I fumbled a lot & gave convoluted answers but when the interviewers left, I was able to think straight & arrived at a very simple solution to the problem. My success rate is 0% so far & I am worried that it is going to take some time before I could get a job. As of now, my strategy has been to prepare as well as possible before hand for the interview and for some reason this strategy does not seem to work. Any suggestions? Thanks.",1282249349

After reading, not only will you smirk when saying Kurt's, ""So it goes"", but have added, ""Who knows?"".",1282248289

Unfortunately, it also translates to lots more compiled code, which means slower compile times and fatter binaries. Still, writing something like the STL library in C with the same performance characteristics would be much more difficult, if not impossible.<p>I'm not a C++ expert, but that's my understanding of things, at least.",1282248259

But those are in the minority.<p>Almost all the criticism I've found seems to take a very shallow, ""soundbite"" perspective.  eg: to presume that the book opposes charity, advocates meanness or evil, etc.<p>Near as I can tell, there is a huge cult who hates Ayn Rand and Atlas Shrugged, and the reason seems to be that her book clearly and logically demolishes the philosophy they espouse.<p>They cannot address it honestly because that would bring up the actual issues in their philosophy and likely many people would see that Atlas Shrugged shows them to be fallacious.<p>So, instead, they attack her with ad hominem and derision and refuse to be honest about what the book actually said.",1282248229

1618424,comment,1618203,1618203,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Adobe is seriously doing it all wrong. They have to open-source the Flash Player and everything around it now. They can keep the IDE proprietary if that floats their boat, it's just a premium authoring tool, but the only way to save Flash is to open-source like NOW. HTML5 is still young enough that an open Flash Player and standard and protocol (RTMP) would effectively kill it.<p>Open-sourcing would open so many doors. Apple could modify Flash until it worked on iOS properly, Google could modify until it worked on Android. The reason this hasn't happened so far is that Adobe is a bottleneck nobody wants to deal with; they just consider basically impossible to get Flash Player on mobile because Adobe doesn't have the structure or the talent to do it correctly, and there is no other option except to let Adobe do it. An open Flash would open many doors, awesome adaptations, deployments, and uses that we can't yet think up would come out of it, and all the while Adobe would keep selling its IDE (probably selling more, actually, because Flash will then do cool stuff that everyone wants).<p>I don't know why they don't do this. Flash Player is already basically free, all of the money from Flash comes from the IDE Adobe sells. Keep the IDE locked up if you want, Adobe, but every second you keep the Player locked up you are killing Flash that much more, and when nobody uses Flash nobody is going to buy your IDE.<p>I know there are free software Flash players out there, but it's not the same. It's like saying nobody needs cooperation from nvidia because of nouveau. While a noble effort with meaningful results, vendor support still gets you much, much farther ahead.<p>If Adobe knows what's good for them they will be opening the Flash Player as quickly as they possibly can. They are going to be very sorry that they didn't. They probably will eventually take this route as a last-ditch effort when Flash content has dipped like 80% and been replaced by HTML5/JS, but that will be too late. This is Adobe's last chance, they must open it now if they expect any kind of future from it.<p>Flash is too big for Adobe alone, and if they don't want the whole thing to crash and burn totally and have that revenue dry up, they need to open ASAP. This should be the number one priority at Adobe.",1282248143

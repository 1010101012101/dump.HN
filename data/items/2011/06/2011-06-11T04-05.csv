In order to get any decent performance I had to layer multiple canvases on top of each other and keep the dimensions of the last draw operation saved so I'd only have to clear that bit of the canvas.

That's a little rude.<p>I'm arguing that URL shorteners have had nothing to do with the popularity of Google Analytics, which is the source of urchin parameters. The dominance of Google and the massive profit incentive around accurately tracking adwords and adsense is what's driving that. Consumers don't care what their URLs look like, so it doesn't matter whether URL shorteners obfuscate them.<p>I recognize that shortened URLs are troublesome for a bookmarking service, but they are hardly insurmountable. I'm not sure I understand why you'd have so much hate for us.<p>(And for the record, URL shortening is not our primary product)",1307768255

It's not any more work to pedal than a larger bike, other than having only the one fairly low gear.<p>Yes it rides fast enough for the street.  The belt drive is so smooth that it's pretty easy to hit 120-150 RPM on pedaling.  (Most riders on a full-size regular geared bike use a cadence somewhere between 70 and 90.)  And the excellent brakes, short stopping distance, and short wheelbase for maneuverability make it an amazing vehicle for navigating city traffic.<p>I do even ride the Strida on sidewalks sometimes for a handful of blocks when the road is too crowded.  Its agility is almost more like a scooter than a full size bicycle.  An alert rider poses virtually no danger to pedestrians, and they're usually caught by the novelty more so than mad at a cyclist on the sidewalk.",1307767559

2643189,story,,,5,4,djsamson,"Ask HN: How can I find a ""mission critical"" company/consumer problem?",,"Steven Blank describes in The Four Steps to the Epiphany that successful startups supply a ""must-have"" consumer product or solve a mission critical company problem.  My problem has been with idea creation. I've been developing 'cool' ideas, but nothing that people absolutely need.<p>I really like Blank's book and I agree with his theory about developing a product hypothesis then talking to potential customers to test if the product is needed. This is basically a way to find customers first, see what they want then begin to build.  But my question is, what if you dont have a product hypothesis? How can you generate product/service ideas that are ""must-have?"" I've been told to ""scratch my own itch,"" but many great startups are B2B. And finding problems that specific businesses face without being apart of that business is difficult. The same can be said for specific consumer markets.",1307765443

But it's much harder for a comp lit person to do so.<p>In other words, both astronomers and literature-lovers might have been deluded about job prospects.

(Of course, you can&#x27;t do that either since the entire cache line will be filled, but the overall point still stands.)<p>The situation we&#x27;re in today with RAM is pretty much the identical situation with the disks of yore.

Did I make driving safer?<p>You certainly would have done an effective job of executing a &#x27;war on car fatalities&#x27; which is what the harryh was claiming was demonstrated by the chart he posted.<p>While I agree that driving is safer than it used to be, the chart harryh posted doesn&#x27;t actually show that. it just shows that driving is safer per mile.<p>Analogous to the point that cbr made: Without changing any of the risks of driving, I could make driving safer per mile by hiring a million drivers to drive 10MPH on a closed track year round.<p>While the above point is rather tongue-in-cheek, I do suspect that a significant part of the drop indicated in harryh&#x27;s chart is due to changing driving patterns, particularly the increase in freeway driving.<p>I don&#x27;t think eliminating all driving would be a good way to reduce traffic deaths (because it all of the other consequences that would have). However, if we had spent more effort in trying to reduce unnecessary and high-risk driving we would see a larger reduction in traffic deaths. This includes solutions like walkable cities, adequate public transit, and higher penalties for drivers engaged in risky behavior that cause fatalities. Focusing purely on deaths per mile excludes those types of interventions. Thus you can&#x27;t use that measure to claim a &#x27;war on car fatalities&#x27;.",1452117248

Performance is much better than AMD, as long as you don&#x27;t use the open source drivers.<p>On Mac, the drivers are crazy out of date and seem to be very tied to specific Mac OS releases.

And criminal background checks are useless if you haven&#x27;t been in the country very long; how are they going to check your background in Pakistan?  Also, the Uber/Lyft reputation systems are far more valuable anyway, plus Uber/Lyft keep detailed records of all their drivers&#x27; movements when they have riders, so it&#x27;s pretty hard for them to get away with anything; cabs aren&#x27;t guaranteed to have any of that oversight.<p>And apparently driving for Uber isn&#x27;t that bad, since the cab companies are now complaining that all the good drivers are switching to Uber/Lyft, leaving them with crappy drivers who earn them huge lawsuits for accidents they cause.",1452116433

If you&#x27;re Netflix wanting to distribute Jessica Jones then you want something like a CDN (although in that context BitTorrent is also &quot;something like a CDN&quot;).<p>But think about wanting to share photos with your friends. There are only thirty people who actually want to see the photos. Twenty five of them live in the same city as you, which makes direction connections to you about as efficient as a local CDN node, and the other five live in four different cities, so in all but one case there is nothing to be gained from caching in any of those places because there will only ever be one copy requested. In that one last case the CDN would conserve just one long-distance copy, and that&#x27;s assuming we can&#x27;t make P2P software smart enough to have the second person in Timbuktu get the photos from the first person there.<p>> we&#x27;re not on IPv6 yet<p>This one is probably the main reason why this hasn&#x27;t actually happened yet, but it&#x27;s not like we don&#x27;t know what to do -- how about we get on IPv6 already?<p>> or that people also use cameras<p>You seem to be implying there is some reason why a photo taken with a camera couldn&#x27;t still be distributed using a mobile device (or plug server or PC or whatever you like).<p>> or that they change their phones<p>And then they can copy the stuff from one to the other.<p>> Not to mention that the assumption that your phone is actually on-line 24/7 is unrealistic<p>Availability is a different tack. OK, your phone doesn&#x27;t have twelve nines of uptime, but it probably is actually online upwards of 90% of the time. And we know how to build reliable systems out of mostly-reliable pieces.<p>We&#x27;re assuming that there is a piece of software on your device which already knows who your friends are. So now it just needs a check box that says &quot;cache things for my friends if they cache things for me&quot; and now your friends can get your photos from your other friends (or from their own device) even when your device is occasionally incommunicado.<p>> or simply want to free up space on SD card for something else.<p>I think there&#x27;s a law of physics that says your photos, to exist, have to exist somewhere.

Here are a few to consider:<p>1. Tamir Rice<p>2. John Crawford III<p>3. Levar Jones<p>4. Laquan McDonald<p>Seriously, I could go on. It happens far too frequently that Americans are killed by police firearms when they are not posing an immediate and credible mortal threat. Sadly, there are too many high-profile cases in which cops fire before even bothering to assess the situation. Videos of these incidents abound.<p>Now, I assume we all agree that police are charged with serving and protecting their communities, right? I believe that also includes suspects and criminals. The bar for determining provocation that warrants deadly force should be <i>very</i> high.<p>If we are being rational and reasonable, I think there are behaviors that we can agree are not provocations of mortal danger. A few such behaviors:<p>1. <i>Running away from police</i><p>2. <i>Verbal altercations</i><p>3. <i>Suspicious behaviors of any kind that are not posing credible mortal threat to other persons or officers</i><p>4. <i>Reaching for waistbands (of what are too often excessively sagging pants that frequently need to be pulled up)</i><p>I think it is reasonable to have a civil, national conversation about better training for police, and a national charge and expectation to keep every potential suspect <i>alive</i> until a situation is properly assessed and resolved.<p>If ranchers in a standoff, or bikers in a gun battle, can make it out alive, I think many more can, too.<p>Funny story from my childhood in Southern California, around 1990:<p>I was playing in the yard with my toy gun. I hated the orange cap at the end of the barrel and had pulled it out with pliers. It was a metal rifle. A cop came down the neighborhood street, and I took cover behind a tree and pretended to shoot, as if he was my new imaginary enemy. He slowed down and stopped in front of the yard. I was within earshot, so he called out to me in a friendly way. Asked if I was shooting at bad guys. I nodded. He asked if I&#x27;d like to see his gun and might be interested in a trade. I thought that was cool, and ran over to his car with my metal toy rifle. He opened his car door to me and stepped out, asking if he could see my gun. I handed it right over, and he invited me to sit in the drivers seat of his squad car. Looking back, I&#x27;m sure he was checking if I had a real firearm. He then showed me the shotgun he had secured between the front seats. He talked to me about being careful with guns. Then he suggested there were some bad guys sneaking around my house, and I should go get them with my gun. And I ran off to chase them down.<p>I shudder to think what would happen to my 12-year-old in the same situation today.",1452115530

It&#x27;s aimed at young teams aiming to disrupt or enter moderate to high complexity markets.<p>You need to consider current size and complexity as well as anticipated size and complexity.<p>Of the two, complexity carries both the higher costs and risks.  This is significant enough to warrant refactoring complexity even if it costs a bit of overall potential efficiency.<p>The reason for that lies in the overall difficulty and lock in that often results from customizations to a given ERP system.  Once those have been implemented, the tradeoff is most likely near term efficiency happening at the expense of modifications needed in the future state and complexity level.<p>Further, a small team may well require complexity on par with much larger and more mature teams.  As they grow and mature themselves, they may find their most competitive options taken off the table due to cost and the inertia present in the initial implementation.<p>These dynamics can be painful enough to warrant using something simple, augmented by people and common sense means and less automation in the beginning.  This can be planned out such that it ends up being a throwaway.  Simple data can often be migrated, transformed, and archived cheaper than a more complex and custom dataset can be.<p>Scalable is just not always the right move early on.  Open data definitely is.<p>Doing this may yield very significant cost advantages in the future when more of the necessary complexity and automation are known to be a genuine competetitive  advantage.  Early dollars and burn rate considerations are important here too.  Spending a lot in the near term may bring risk and cost, where doing that later on may just bring a cost, which can be managed more reasonably.<p>You should consider team size, data complexity, market maturity, team maturity, and align that with potential automation as well as where a standard workflow and data representation can work.<p>A mature market works very different from a new one, and if disruption is part of the business model, it&#x27;s also very likely to require unique capability from what potential ERP vendors offer.  You may consider understanding what is standard, or low cost, low risk features and investing in processes to work with those.  Many advanced, &quot;yeah we do that&quot; features are often more like platforms and frameworks than products.  Be aware these work at the fortune 500 level, but may be completely impractical otherwise.  Vendors will not always present these in ways where that can be understood, and some who shall remain nameless here will leave that spillage to their services team or a partner to sort out long after the initial dales investment is difficult to walk away from.<p>In that case, you will be left with a high cost implementation and internal IT burden, or will have to patch it in and integrate some other product or just live with a less effective overall solution.<p>Finally, be aware of cozy people and vendor relationships.  These may appear to be advantageous, and may be in mature, well proven use cases, but may in fact be limiting and costly for new or disruptive ones.<p>It may be worth your time to evaluate the systems and processes used by the target to be disrupted and with an eye on solution vendors and their vision alignment to your &quot;to be&quot; disrupted state.

In the vast majority of cases where a taser is deployed the individual is in a drug-induced state with increased heart activity. Combine that with the escalating situation and the individual&#x27;s heart rate is often higher than if they were just in the drug-induced state. These individuals are often highly combative at the time the taser is deployed. Given normal circumstances a taser deployment on these individuals most likely would not result in any harm. However, combine that deployment with the increased heart activity and adrenaline going through the individuals system and it becomes a recipe for disaster.<p>To generalize and say that tasers are dangerous does not take into account the entire picture of events or situation at hand.

10853780,comment,10849458,10852708,0,0,cobaltblue,,,"Adding to this, imagine you were part of an ancient alien species checking in on earth every so often. Around 4.5 billion years ago, Earth was formed. 500 million years later, the first self-replicators appeared. Another half billion years (now 3.5 billion years ago) for things to settle down and create the most recent ancestor from which all life descends from. Over the next 3 billion years nothing much happens, until the Phanerozoic Eon is reached around 500 million years ago where more &quot;interesting&quot;, larger life starts to develop. But again for another half a billion years nothing that much happens other than evolution continuing playing its game of optimizing for gene replication in more and more interesting ways. Around one hundred thousand years ago, an interesting branch of a species has been developing in ways that indicate the rise of general intelligence (their few pounds of squishy matter in their heads are pretty neat: <a href=""http://www.yudkowsky.net/singularity/power/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yudkowsky.net/singularity/power/</a>). But they don&#x27;t seem to be doing all that much until about 10-20 thousand years ago. And even then, less than 10 thousand years ago, they built some interesting structures like the pyramids, but their population is still tiny and their global influence is limited. And it wasn&#x27;t until about 500 years ago when things really started picking up in population growth and world influence (some mark that as the discovery of a formal scientific process to build and record more and more truths about the world that are actually true). Just around 100 years ago, this species developed air travel. In about 60 years after that, they went beyond their planet to their moon. This species at present could wipe out almost all life from the planet (if it wanted, which it doesn&#x27;t) in multiple ways, to really get every last bit of life exterminated would take some doing but in a large enough time span doesn&#x27;t seem impossible.<p>An alien species would have to be observing this planet at very frequent intervals to be able to catch any of these recent developments -- because if millions of years ago they determined nothing interesting was happening, and decided to only look in every five hundred thousand years or so, it&#x27;s very likely the last time they looked our species wasn&#x27;t even around.<p>Now you take the development of an AI that is roughly human level intelligent with a given amount of resources. If you give it the same amount of resources again, it can &quot;breed&quot;, copy itself perfectly onto them, and now we have a &quot;population&quot; of two AIs whose combined intelligence should roughly match that of two twin humans. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t even copy perfectly, maybe it switches some things about to see if it can create something smarter without modifying its own code directly. In any case its breeding is only restricted by its ability to breed and desire to breed in the first place and the compute and power resources it needs to run a new copy, and these can always get lower than initially. What does the long-term look like? Even if the initial resources for the first one are astronomical (e.g. all computing power in use on the planet as of 2016), I would still bet you that left to breed without any other restriction it would take the AI family far less time than 100 thousand years to reach 7 billion instances. So you&#x27;re looking at many, many more AIs than non-AIs, plus each with human level intelligence that isn&#x27;t distributed normally (assuming soft eugenics doesn&#x27;t become widespread in non-AI populations) but is mainly all the same with perhaps increases here and there (assuming a soft takeoff), each coordinating with the same goals in mind. This situation without further specification can be either extremely good for the non-AIs or extremely bad for the non-AIs. The question of whether this will happen (and whether it happens in that exact form, personally I think hard takeoff from a single AI is likely) in the next 100 years or the next hundred thousand years (perhaps a near-extinction-level event occurs forcing our species to basically start over but with an even harder battle to survive since many low-hanging-fruit resources have been depleted) might help you determine whether to worry now about doing actions that make the extremely-good more likely than the extremely-bad, but if one thinks human-level AI can&#x27;t happen at all in any amount of time, that there&#x27;s something special about our squishy brains or something inherently limiting about our so-far-general intelligence such that we can&#x27;t solve the engineering problem of creating another intelligence directly and must always go through breeding, the argument needs to take place at a different level.<p>The paperclip maximizer argument (not sure if Bostrom repeats it in his book) is yet another level of argument but it&#x27;s meant for those who already buy the premise of human level AI and self-improving AI but who also think increased intelligence will naturally converge to a human-loving benevolent AI that sees how self-evidently obvious it is to love all life or whatever, that we don&#x27;t have to worry about all the messy details around Friendliness because they&#x27;ll just fall out of the entity naturally. No one is actually worried about Clippy tiling the solar system with himself, its probability is epsilon. But a lot of people just see this one argument out of context and infer the arguer believes it to be a relevant possibility to worry about and write off the whole group as crazy...",1452114482

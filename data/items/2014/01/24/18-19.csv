The presence of an event horizon is quite often used as <i>the</i> defining feature of a black hole. The event horizon <i>is</i> the &quot;point of no return&quot; beyond which gravity is inescapable. If Hawking is claiming there is no definable event horizon (due to turbulence or whatever else), then he&#x27;s claiming that there is no set of points near a dense, massive object that are inescapable.<p>Now, it may be fair to label this as sensationalism anyway. The source here is a brief, conceptual talk by Hawking at a conference (and an associated writeup): it&#x27;s not as if he&#x27;s proven a theorem (as he did years ago when he first demonstrated Hawking radiation, for instance).

The tech world is full of impressionistic statements like &#x27;they have a startup scene,&#x27; but when you start getting numbers on available talent, you&#x27;ll see you&#x27;re putting yourself in a bad position.<p>To take an example where I have better data, people have commented on the vibrant and growing startup scene in Santiago, Chile. Maybe it is vibrant and growing, but the total number of people professionally employed in software development (devs, testers, manager, product managers, etc.) is only about 2000.<p>Split that 2000 into 50 different companies (and 50 tech companies would often be held up as proof of viability for the location), eliminate the high percentage with the wrong skill set for your company, and how likely is it, really, that you could build an engineering team of 20 and sustain that in the face of attrition over time?<p>St. Louis isn&#x27;t going to have more than a few thousand of the same sort of people. Most of them are also not products of local universities with strong engineering programs relevant to most of the kinds of software behind most tech startups these days. The supply therefore is not growing at a steady rate or being replenished.<p>75 startups in one location? What happens, when the half that make it past the founder stage need to hire 3-4 people? Not only are there only a few available devs of any skill level available for each, but they all have dozens of options on the same block.<p>For startups, a higher percentage of engineers in an area employed by companies of 50-people or less actually makes hiring harder. In such a situation, they all have options of more or less equal value, and you have little to distinguish yourself from the others. The fact that SV has Google, Yahoo, Mcsft, etc. alongside a ton of mid-sized and smaller companies makes it easier.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever tried to recruit for a startup, think about how often you bring up ownership, autonomy, &quot;startup culture,&quot; etc. as selling points? How well does that work in an environment, when nearly everyone already has that where they are?<p>This is just a quick set of reflections, but the overall point I hope is made. The truth is that staffing your startup is one of the most brutal forms of competition your business will experience. You&#x27;re one of many, many players competing for an extremely scarce resource that very few founders even know how to identify, qualify, or retain, once they&#x27;ve got them.<p>If you ever plan on building your company beyond a small team of friends and local referrals, you should be doing everything you can to stack the deck in your favor. The Bering Sea may be an expensive and crowded area for gold prospecting, but you&#x27;re still more likely to find gold there than in Lake Michigan.",1390589588

7116638,comment,7114689,7116226,2,0,tptacek,,,"We are in fact better off without DNSSEC:<p>* DNSSEC bakes a hierarchical PKI controlled at the roots by world governments into the core of Internet connectivity, in a way that can&#x27;t be policy-controlled by users.<p>* DNSSEC has a poorly-thought-out interaction with Internet security and security policy; when TLS validation fails, users get a click-through that allows them to proceed to the site anyways. No similar state machine is built into the overwhelming majority of programs that do DNS lookups. As a result, if anything goes wrong with your DNSSEC configuration, you will more or less vanish from the Internet. &quot;gethostbyname()&quot; doesn&#x27;t include a popup dialog feature.<p>* Mainstream deployments of DNSSEC are based on 1990s crypto, including PKCS#1v1.5 RSA padding; at exactly the moment when the rest of the Internet is transitioning away from crappy old RSA protocols, DNSSEC doubles down on it.<p>* DNSSEC leaks internal hostnames to the Internet because the designers of the protocols prioritized authenticated denials (availability) over confidentiality. NSEC3 is a great illustration of how slapdash the protocol design is: in an attempt to plug that leak, the IETF standardized what is in effect a password hash (and a bad one) to help obscure internal hostnames. When challenged on why the Internet should adopt a 1990s password hash as an Internet core protocol security mechanism, DNSSEC proponents say, &quot;well, well-managed domains make domain cuts carefully to solve this problem&quot;, as if any commercial network in the world actually does that.<p>* DNSSEC creates yet another huge amplifier for DDoS attacks, allowing trivially small requests to elicit gigantic responses from servers.<p>Now, two fun things to know about all these problems:<p>1. They are, unlike your citation of crappy CAs, <i>baked in design flaws in the protocol</i>. You can evict a CA that misbehaves or isn&#x27;t careful about validation. The EFF or ACLU could run a program that would allow people to subscribe to a trusted subset of CAs. None of that is possible in DNSSEC, because DNSSEC&#x27;s problems aren&#x27;t implementation or deployment problems, but rather fundamental attributes of the system.<p>* For all its flaws, DNSSEC <i>doesn&#x27;t actually protect queries from end systems to servers</i>: it is a server-to-server system that leaves end-user DNS queries unprotected and spoofable.<p>I don&#x27;t think this system is something we need &quot;yesterday&quot;.<p>I have a lot of random opinions and thoughts about things, including security things, that I come to because discussions in places like HN prompt me to develop those opinions. DNSSEC is not one of those things. I&#x27;ve been following DNSSEC standardization since... well, since DNSSEC was an effort of TIS Labs, which was owned by my employer, where I was building DNS security testing tools. I&#x27;ve particularly followed namedroppers since the early 00&#x27;s, when the list drove Daniel Bernstein away from DNS standardization.",1390589425

Rents have shot up by ~50% since 2008, office space is following the same trend, and competition for (even mediocre) programmers is intense.  Worse, a lot of the cultural diversity that made San Francisco interesting has been driven out by the high prices -- it&#x27;s a much more homogenous city than a few years ago, where mom-and-pop shops and other neighborhood amenities have been replaced by places selling $10 &quot;artisinal grilled cheese&quot; sandwiches and &quot;mixology&quot; bars where you can buy your choice of $15 cocktail.

Living here on anything less than a good engineer&#x27;s salary is becoming a tall order.<p>Which brings us to a very important point for all the young programmer dudes:  when you all crowd into the same tiny city and bid up the rents into the stratosphere, your available dating pool shrinks to a puddle (yet another consequence of the skewed gender balance in tech. sigh.)

In order to make a change to the real DOM, React computes a diff between the newly virtual DOM and the previously computed virtual DOM, and then it applies the diff to the real DOM. The triggering to the virtual DOM computation is done explicitly, hence React has a lot better DOM rendering performances.\nEverything you can do in React, you can do with other frameworks (Angular&#x27;s directives and isolated scopes for example), but React is a lot faster and easier to learn, and definitely worth looking into.",1390587907

By comparison, Salt&#x27;s implementation is currently a rough sketch, and one they discourage using.<p>Ansible has a pretty robust implementation that allows sudo and su operations, and is pretty finely tuned for using things like ControlPersist, reports nicely on when passwords being incorrect, and also has a paramiko implementation for older EL platforms where ControlPersist is not available.  Doing things like detecting when the SSH-key is not added yet, etc, are also well handled to lock and be able to ask prompts only when needed, etc.<p>Ansible also features a higher speed &#x27;accelerated mode&#x27; that uses SSH for secure key exchange, without relying on in-house crypto.  Though the new pipelining features in 1.5 make SSH about as fast as accelerate mode, so that&#x27;s saying something!<p>Anyway, we take security very very seriously, which is why we invest so much in having a great SSH implementation.<p>See also:<p><a href=""http://blog.ansibleworks.com/2013/12/08/the-origins-of-ansible/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ansibleworks.com/2013/12/08/the-origins-of-ansib...</a><p><a href=""http://blog.ansibleworks.com/2013/11/29/ansibles-architecture-beyond-configuration-management/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ansibleworks.com/2013/11/29/ansibles-architectur...</a>",1390586818

Sadly, it is not available in English. Someday I will probably translate it myself.

I&#x27;m not sure if it was translated, but I would certainly search for German and English translations.<p>Before watching the movie you surely must know something about the Doctors&#x27; plot [3], the fact that the rooms and the atmosphere of the main hero&#x27;s apartment was made after the apartment of Alexey German&#x27;s father and, probably, that an episode when an old family friend from a foreign country get&#x27;s punched in a face has had a basis in Alexey German&#x27;s life.

Delivering news from the other half living outside of the Soviet Union could have meant a death sentence for Alexey German&#x27;s father and misery for all of his family. Even though an Alexey German&#x27;s pro-monarchism uncle living in exile has urged his old pro-communist Western friend not to visit his brother (and, consequently, an Alexey German&#x27;s father) during his stay in Moscow, he got drunk and visited him).<p>I could make some more comments, but I&#x27;m not sure if they would do you any good and not spoil anything.<p>To better understand the Stalin&#x27;s era overall, I&#x27;d read Varlam Shalamov [4], just everything that you can lay your hands on.

Not that I don&#x27;t think that Stalin was an evil person, or that the Stalin era and Soviet Union are so mysterious that they are unfathomable to the people in the Western world. It&#x27;s just that the ideological differences are still huge and the Cold War propaganda in the West IS a form of reality through which, as if it was some sort of glasses, Western people view the stuff that was going on here in USSR. The Soviet lies died when the Union fell, but the Western ones are living and well. Haha, didn&#x27;t mean to make a rhyme...<p>Just as a side note: there are some truly great and deep fiction writers that wrote about Stalin&#x27;s atrocities, such as Varlam Shalamov [4], Yury Dombrovsky [5], Georgy Demidov [6], Yevgenia Ginzburg [7], etc. etc. But the most famous in the West is a mediocre, albeit convenient Alexander Solzhenitsyn that has suited the propaganda needs, hated the Soviet Union and was willing to pull various &quot;facts&quot; out of his ass.

It tells you what you&#x27;re mining, it isn&#x27;t hidden. And no, it doesn&#x27;t convert to BTC automatically. You get whatever you mine.",1390586529

Mine was, and yet everyone talks about the Mac SE or 512 like those were the earliest ones ever.<p>I bought a 2nd FD and a 300/1200 baud modem to go with it.

I used it to desktop-publish (sort of) a newsletter for our sci-fi club. We didn&#x27;t have the ability to scan in the masthead or any pictures, so there was old fashioned cut and paste going on as well. :)",1390586446

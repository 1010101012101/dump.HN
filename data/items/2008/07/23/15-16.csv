But I'm still not convinced that tinkering with the definition of <i>obvious</i> is going to solve our patent troll problem. So long as it still needs to be litigated, it doesn't matter how obvious a troll's patent is, just as it doesn't matter whether the gun you're being mugged with is loaded or not.<p><i>Do you think that I, or anyone else, would have put up with all the pain and the long hours in the lab if we new that Agilent or Biorad could swoop in at any moment and take our markets away from us using their marketing clout?</i><p>I'm sure that folks reading this site -- the ones whose products could be cloned by Google or Yahoo at any moment; the ones whose earlier companies were crushed by Microsoft -- have an entire orchestra of tiny violins to play for you.<p>I used to build multiphoton microscopes for a living. The story of the multiphoton microscope is amusing. Once upon a time, Bio-Rad held the exclusive rights to the original Cornell patent. Their competitor, Zeiss, read the patent and decided to argue that it covered only the use of <i>sub-picosecond</i> laser pulses for microscopy. So Zeiss came out with a competing system intended for use with 1 picosecond pulses. Of course, if you found yourself in the lab late at night and you happened to turn the knob on your laser that shortened the pulses to 80 femtoseconds, your Zeiss microscope presumably continued to work pretty well, but with a big improvement in image brightness and depth. I assume that Zeiss refused to be held responsible for that improvement -- after all, <i>the scope wasn't intentionally designed for short pulses</i>, because that would be Legally Dubious.<p>Naturally, the whole thing went to court for years. The issue was settled when Zeiss bought out Bio-Rad. See here:<p><a href=""http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0401&L=confocal&D=0&P=99334"" rel=""nofollow"">http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0401&L=conf...</a><p>I can't tell you who won or who lost, there, but here's my conclusion: If a company the size of Agilent or Zeiss or Biorad wants to violate your patent, they'll just do it. All you were doing, in those nights in the lab, was trying to improve your negotiating position in the resulting court case.<p>(That, BTW, was a traditional <i>hardware</i> patent, not the software kind. If yours is a software-only patent... good luck with that.)",1216828798

Not to mention they're just going to get a bunch of bad press when they don't completely dominate.<p>Buying the 800lb gorilla for $200M is a relative bargain.

254379,comment,254101,254101,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"How does Git compare to the other DVCSs? Aside from a few articles that compare it to one or two others, generally Mercurial, I haven't seen many informed comparisons that aren't a few years old. Git seems to get a lot of buzz because it's involved with Linus and (perhaps as a result) seems to be the hip thing in the Ruby community, but most of the buzz just says, ""wow, git is better than Subversion!"" for values of better that likely apply to every distributed VC system (e.g., ""it lets me commit offline!""). Are there recent, informed, detailed comparisons?<p>I have been using Monotone for several months, including keeping my home directory under VC and synchronized between my desktop, server, and laptop, and have been quite pleased with it. I like its systems of using hashes as version IDs, and having one SQLite file for the entire database seems like a good idea.<p>Monotone got a little slow after I added several thousand files, but then I noticed there is a flag to first check against cached inodes (<a href=""http://monotone.ca/docs/Inodeprints.html#Inodeprints"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monotone.ca/docs/Inodeprints.html#Inodeprints</a>) instead of recalculating the hashes for everything every time. It's apparently disabled to have a default stance of <i>extreme caution</i>, but doesn't seem to pose anymore risk than, say, using a journaling filesystem, and speeds things up dramatically. The few evaluations I've seen of mtn wrote it off as slow, without trying this.<p>The ""algebra of patches"" system in Darcs looks interesting, as well. As I understand it: every change has its inverse calculated, so you can apply / undo any combination of patches in the entire history. I haven't used it for more than a few quick experiments, though.",1216826688

It was ever thus.</i><p>Here we have the modern cultural critic at work: He doesn't just wag his finger -- he <i>deconstructs himself</i> at the same time! So, when I point out that this guy just another in a long line of whining moral scolds, he can claim that he understood that all along! He was just being <i>ironic</i>! Isn't hipster detachment fun -- even when the guy's wrong, he's right!<p>So, yeah, he's right: This is a steaming pile of Get Off My Lawn. The big clue is the part where he loses focus on the issue of focus (<i>irony</i>!) and starts teeing off on these kids today, who spend all their time on the internet <i>gossiping with each other</i> instead of reading improving books. Even the <i>parodies</i> of this line of argument are older than dirt: Before the Internet it was video games, reality television, cartoons, gangs, pop music, drugs, punk rock, hard rock, progressive rock, Jimi Hendrix, birth control pills, Elvis Presley, beatniks, Buddy Holly, swing dance, movie theaters, the wrong <i>kind</i> of books, jazz clubs, speakeasies, ragtime, billiard parlors, opium dens, all-night poker games, gangs...<p>Even the interesting part, the bit about distraction, is old news. Distraction is, indeed, one of the modern world's biggest sources of stress, unhappiness and poor productivity, <i>but that is nothing new</i>. This guy accurately notes that concern about information overload dates back to Thoreau's unhappiness with the telegraph and the newspaper -- and I'd bet the Zen Buddhists would be willing to argue it goes back even farther. You're telling me that the Internet is somehow even more pernicious and distracting than leaving the TV on all day, which has been going on for sixty years? That workers in the seventies didn't find wired telephones and intercoms and water coolers and newspapers and muzak distracting? (I guess Demarco and Lister are precogs -- they railed about this stuff in <i>Peopleware</i> before the Web even existed.)<p>And then, rather than talk about how to <i>ameliorate</i> the information overload problem, the guy throws up his hands and proclaims that we're doomed to a new Dark Age (!).

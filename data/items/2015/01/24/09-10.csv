8939262,comment,8936750,8938417,0,0,robert_tweed,,,"This appears to be GA rather than GP, but I did some experiments with GP a while ago and the most counterintuitive thing I discovered was how <i>essential</i> junk code turns out to be.<p>First, for anyone unaware of the difference, in Genetic Algorithms (GA) you have fixed-length strings of instructions. Genetic Programming (GP) is a superset in which you have ASTs, which can get arbitrarily large (which can be a problem if you&#x27;re not careful). I find GP much more interesting than GA, but the practical issues with AST bloat are why you see a lot more GA examples.<p>Anyway, not wanting to run into overly large ASTs myself, I went ahead and prematurely optimised my GP implementation by having it always collapse functions into simpler forms where possible, e.g. (+ (+ 1 2) 3) becomes (+ 6).<p>It turns out that this causes huge problems, because all that &quot;junk&quot; code is actually useful during evolution. Each generation inherits parts of its parents (called &quot;crossover&quot;), but if you cut down the information available to inherit as-per the above optimisation, you get much less variety between the generations and become more reliant on random mutations. As a result, it&#x27;s like falling back on bogosort to find your solution.<p>Once you get down into final generations you can start running optimisations like this and removing dead code, but if you do it too soon, you won&#x27;t reach a solution convergence quickly, if at all.<p>Interestingly, this principle seems to apply to DNA too, but DNA doesn&#x27;t come with an optimiser. Hence most DNA is &quot;junk&quot; but the junk is actually more important than it seems.<p>It also turns out that genetically optimising (as opposed to hand-coding the optimisation rules, like I did) is non-trivial too. You can either adjust your main cost function to account for code size/speed alongside the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve, or you can do a second pass that aims to optimise the code after you&#x27;ve already found an acceptable solution. Either way, there&#x27;s a certain amount of black magic involved to decide how many iterations to run, or what constitutes a &quot;good enough&quot; or &quot;fast enough&quot; or &quot;small enough&quot; solution so you can decide when to stop.<p>Code size is also irrelevant in GA because the code is always the same size, but different instructions might have different costs, with NOPs having the lowest cost. If you allow goto or recursion in your VM then you have to impose a runtime constraint to avoid infinite loops, and can also assign a cost per instruction executed or per microsecond of runtime.",1422093046

For example, the page could generate 10 random logos, then you choose the one you prefer. Then, it generates 10 random logos based on that one, and repeat. This way, you literally just click three times, and you decided on the best logo for you out of 1,000 randomly generated ones.<p>Right now it&#x27;s kind of clunky, and it takes a little while just to setup one concept.

Even realistic languages like C can be parsed without using anything much more advanced than regexes (you need some ugly kludges to support typedefs, and you should pretty much ignore newlines; one would typically use something more like yacc, but that&#x27;s still not a very sophisticated tool.)<p>On the other hand, XML or HTML (which are not Turing-complete, and, informally, &quot;not that expressive&quot;) are pretty much impossible to usefully parse without extensively considering context - <a><b /><c /><d /></a> gives and <e><d /></e> are &quot;very different <d />&#x27;s&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know XScript, but regexes may be a completely viable approach. In fact, if your current approach works, it&#x27;s likely good enough - it requires some theoretical background to express <i>why</i> you can&#x27;t parse HTML with regexes, but you&#x27;ll run into lots of trouble if you try (leading to stuff like <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-...</a>).

If you need some aerial photography done, hire a qualified drone pilot for a few hours. In fact, that will probably become a specialty business of independent operators or small companies - qualified pilots with high-quality drones and camera gear. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see this become a &quot;pivot&quot; for current commercial photographers in the weddings/product photos business.<p>Depending on the complexity of your project, that might cost more than outright purchase of a cheaper(er) drone, but I would argue this is a net win. A whole little business niche gets created, and most of the drones in the sky are 1) flown by experienced operators, and 2) high-quality and therefore probably easier to control.",1424066333

If you want to justify it you&#x27;ll have to study some philosophy!<p>Only if I want to justify it to philosophers, but since I&#x27;m more interested in understanding the world I live in I&#x27;ll just continue in my ignorance.<p>> More generally, your attitude is one that&#x27;s typical of physicists these days, who tend to approach the philosophical literature with a huge superiority complex.<p>That&#x27;s a bit rich.  It is funny how the &quot;other side&quot; always looks a little ridiculous.<p>> With enough time science washes all of those things away. That&#x27;s not an attitude that was shared by the 20th century&#x27;s greatest physicists.<p>Even if that wasn&#x27;t an exaggeration, so what?  Newton was an alchemist.  Maxwell was a Christian.  Oppenheimer and Schroedinger studied eastern philosophy.  A lot of physicists have liked western philosophy.  What I haven&#x27;t seen is evidence that makes me think <i>wow, studying philosophy really payed off for those guys I should do that too!</i>  Instead it looks like another idiosyncracy.",1424066212

However, it&#x27;s worth noting that this respectfulness was far from unanimous. For example, no less an eminence than John Wheeler is on video saying, &quot;Philosophy is too important to be left to the philosophers.&quot; [0]<p>Also, physics _is_ special, and does &quot;play a special role&quot; in all topics pertaining to reality, because it is by definition falsifiable by experiment. Many disciplines (including but obviously not limited to philosophy) lack that falsifiability, and are therefore lower on the epistemological totem pole.<p>In these sorts of debates, it&#x27;s sometimes helpful to see if claims become ridiculous when you replace &quot;philosophy&quot; with some known-silly ideology.<p>>>&quot;The claim that physics plays that special role within scientology is itself a scientological claim.

I am jack-of-all-trade to many, but as a devops I can&#x27;t do everything at once.<p>> storing some web analytics and personal finance information<p>Fair. My company&#x27;s finance data would be under compliance regulation, but even as a SaaS to provide easy-access easy-to-understand web analytics means you are going to have access to customer&#x27;s data, or the customer is passing you data that the customer doesn&#x27;t wish to share with others. Take an analytic SaaS to see your AWS usage. That requires a separate READ-ONLY access to your AWS account.<p>Twitter recently dropped employee access to internal data. People suggest this was done to avoid insider trading. I don&#x27;t know if that was the real intent, but let&#x27;s take that as a yes, then web analytic is just sensitive as one&#x27;s financial information.<p>Security is not easy, just like writing code is not easy.

9055459,comment,9055206,9055206,0,0,philips,,,"It generally comes down to picking something you understand how to update and manage. Most of the base OS security is a practice in staying up to date and applying patches very regularly.<p>There are two types of Linux OSes in general: versioned release and rolling release, which I will explain below.<p>When choosing a versioned release distro you need to pick something that you feel comfortable you can update on a regular basis without breaking your application dependencies AND plan for the eventual migration to the next versioned release of the distro. Any release you choose will be supported for several years with security updates and then fazed out. When that end of life date hits you must move your application to that next version. Examples of these types of distros are CentOS, Ubuntu LTS, etc.<p>An alternative is building your application with containers and choosing a rolling update distro. The advantage for security is two fold:<p>1) It makes it easier to roll out new versions of your application on a regular basis because it is possible for two versions of your app to live side-by-side. And for a new web based project most of your security problems will likely be from your web frameworks, custom code, etc not from the underlying OS. So, having a system in place to get those updates out will be critical.<p>2) The Linux OS can be updated on a much tighter cadence because your application isn&#x27;t relying on much from the OS besides the container runtime. Rolling release server distros include Arch Linux, CoreOS, Gentoo, etc. CoreOS even fully-automates the OS update process to remove the burden of remembering to audit and apply updates.<p>Using a rolling release distro without containers is an option too but can be bumpier since you will regularly be going through migrations like /usr/bin/python being 2.7 and then migrating to 3.0 without you noticing.<p>The final thing you might consider, particularly if operations aren&#x27;t your forte, is using something like Google App Engine, Heroku, etc. These systems are ideal for building a prototype and focusing on the initial minimal viable product.<p>disclosure: I work at CoreOS",1424064514

Why is it that we can be so convinced of our dreams as if it were real? Why is it that they by themselves have no real beginning or an end, sort of like our own existence? What if your life is just an episode of a dream? Who&#x27;s running the simulations? Why is it not just one continuous flowing state? Why does it need to be disparate and seemingly discontinuous?<p>My view is that this is actually the most efficient state a simulation can reach. If it was one giant cesspool of initial variables in one bubble it would be pretty obvious for the inhabitants of the simulation to figure out the walls quickly and before long question what&#x27;s outside of it. The same reason that we can realize we are dreaming and experience lucid dreaming. But, we can&#x27;t for the love of god find this wall in our own reality because our brain through years of evolution by previous consciousness, have been designed to find safety in numbers, fight or flight reflexes, gather or horde scarce goods. Only when our innate animal like instincts are squelched can we experience reality in it&#x27;s rawest and purest form, something buddhist tibetian monks often frequent, a higher form of understanding where they are able to feel the whole range of human experiences without actually doing them because they realize that it&#x27;s actually our own consciousness that trap us into realities that we create for ourselves.<p>Knowing that we can and create simulations of our own through dreaming, out of will, help of substances or even meditation, it shows that at the outer level our reality can be fluid and can take many different shapes or forms.<p>In the end, our own intelligence, our ability to find patterns out of chaos, traps us into thinking that something that doesn&#x27;t follow a rigid set of rules or lack of data automatically mean that they don&#x27;t exist, when in fact, such narrow mindedness can only come from the choice to view reality and oneself with the same set of practices used in laboratory or whatever environment where such mentality has been useful.<p>I will say that even the latter situation is actually a simulation of it&#x27;s own, but much much worse kind, it&#x27;s created and rigorously maintained by other consciousnesses aimed at supressing all other views.<p>Quantumn theory suggests that we live in our own simulation create by us, religious texts also suggests the same thing, you shape your own reality but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s lacking the same solid walls as the one you create, it must be that the most efficient simulation is also one where every possible permutation is achievable, that our collective human race is literally a race towards achieving some enlightened status as a whole, that through experiencing life in the myriad of lives, that our collective consciousness will improve and become efficient, that it outlives all things biological, it continues beyond even our own planet, maybe we are truly one with the universe and everything it represents, we are simply the creation, not of an external super intelligent aliens, not future versions of us running Matrix 2.0 for shits and giggles but because it simply is the way it is designed, the same way we discover math in our own reality, and how it reveals answers, it must be that we are the simulation, not the simulatees or simulators.",1424064023

There are already over a dozen electronic venues for bond trading, some of which are pretty successful and allied with major liquidity providers.<p>The core problem they are trying to solve is an example of something being broken by design:<p>>>> &quot;the bond market doesn’t have a centralized system where traders can plainly see the fees involved in the trade. This means traders have to ask each bank, one by one, either by phone or electronically, what they are willing to sell a Treasury bond for.&quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t exactly true - there are plenty of electronic quotes for small size. When you want to trade a lot of bonds - that&#x27;s another story. The dealers don&#x27;t want their prices out there electronically for any taker, because fixed income markets are relatively illiquid and the transparency can hurt them.<p>Not exactly sure how this will be overcome, but my general assumption is to borrow from the dark pool model for equities.",1424063553

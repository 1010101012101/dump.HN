9320287,comment,9318286,9320174,0,0,gojomo,,,"My hunch is that the overwhelmingly dominant and important use case is where these identifiers appear in URLs, including URL fragments (and potentially in brand-new protocols). A few other important cases are also where they&#x27;re visible to people, as in the example (or hypothetical) command-lines that kicked off this thread. In those cases, explicitness-at-a-glance helps, as will having one canonical encoding (such as b32, b64, or b58).<p>Compared to that, adaptation to other constrained systems is a case-by-case issue. And if those systems are already capable of squeezing in these non-native slightly-longer hash-like-strings, then a few more bytes usually won&#x27;t hurt, or if they do then whatever deep-in-the-bits coder (like yourself) who&#x27;s shoehorning things in can handle compactification. The display/exchange format should be as casually readable as possible.<p>Such an ASCII-name-inspired prefix is <i>readable</i> in all encodings. In some, it&#x27;s just a magic number (but one that any coder can make educated guesses about); but in the one encoding that&#x27;s likely most important for mutual comprehension between humans (user-exchanged strings and URLs), it&#x27;s super-duper-readable.<p>And yes, the prefix should in general have special handling: as the <i>multihash</i> project README notes in an important &quot;warning&quot;, the prefix lacks the same distribution as the other bytes. Treating the whole thing as an opaque-but-still-reliable identifier invites indexing misoptimizations right off the bat, and then other later bugs, if any of the hash functions become deprecated, or a new hash is added with variant semantics.",1428133567

No, really - because of the factors you mention, porn tends to get made by people who have a bit of money, go into making porn, and re-invest the profits from DVD or subscription sales. I&#x27;d say this is more true than ever nowadays because it&#x27;s so cheap to make <i>something</i> and a lot of people aren&#x27;t that concerned about aesthetics or quality. I&#x27;d guess your main problem is that at the low end of the market the money comes more from advertising than subscriptions, but 99% of the porn ads I&#x27;ve ever seen were ugly and tacky and often really offensive, which doesn&#x27;t sound compatible with your desire to build and ethical site.<p>Anyway, people who make porn have to have some sort of declaration on their website about all the participants being over 18, and that includes the legal contact point for the publisher by law, so I guess you could scope out a bunch of upmarket porn sites and get in touch with the publishing companies.<p>Drop me a line if you want.

I&#x27;m not anti-diversity. I&#x27;m actually a huge proponent of diversity. I just believe that hypocrisy and reserve discrimination is the wrong way to get there.

Cognitive and cultural diversity for example are examples of two other vectors in which someone can contribute to diversity. What happened to MLK&#x27;s dream of focusing on content of character instead of color of a person&#x27;s skin? At the end of the day characteristics of like gender, race and identity are merely a few of the many factors that contribute to the sum total of experiences that makes someone who they are and who they will be become.

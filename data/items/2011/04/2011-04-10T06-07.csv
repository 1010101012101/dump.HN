2429057,comment,2428004,2428820,4,0,phintjens,,,"These are good points. Let me answer them.<p>1. The 0MQ devs originally got asserts backwards, using them to validate external input (e.g. on sockets) instead of internal consistency. We've been fixing this for a year or two now, and it's pretty good. You'll get assertion failures if you e.g. use sockets from multiple threads. Not so much if you pass bad stuff onto sockets.<p>2. 2.1 was a great step forwards, and the use of ""sleep"" was in toy examples. Real networking apps tend to run forever, so this message loss at exit wasn't a big deal. You're right that the product is still young.<p>3. Totally agreed, this lack of peer presence detection is annoying, and the source of some debate on the lists.<p>4. Threading model works fine for me, I've used it extensively. A usable reactor is a hundred lines of code, no more. See the libzapi zloop reactor, in C, for example.<p>5. Demultiplexing sounds like useful functionality but should probable sit above sockets.",1302418748

2429055,comment,2428746,2429002,3,0,jschrf,,,"""Did you know that C# has: lambdas, closures, optional duck typing, first-class functions, better generics than Java, and type inference that is sometimes spooky?""<p>I did know that, and these things heavily factor into why I default to C# for most projects these days! .NET 4 is awesome.<p>C# is an excellent language. It has all these great things, yet doesn't feel polluted or bloated at all. I absolutely love lambdas, closures, and generics. They help write concise and clear code. Generic support in C# and F# and the CLR itself is brilliant.<p>Writing event-driven, asynchronous IO code in .NET code is a breeze. It seems like the current programming trend around these parts is focused on ""iterating fast"" and having async IO. C# gives me both of these things, with the bonus of having the compiler catch most of my errors.<p>I disagree with the general notion that duck-typed languages are more empowering or let you iterate faster than strongly typed languages.<p>If you think that a language that is lazy (or worse, unspecific) about types lets you write code faster, I think that you have some fundamental problems with how you approach development.<p>The whole dynamic languages = faster code production is an unsettling school of thought, in my opinion.",1302418680

- serves as the last resort to try to read the  floppy disk where the unique copy of some historical file has been stored

 - can be used to run diagnosis on serial ports

Going at it alone is well, lonely, as anyone who's done it can attest. But solo founders can support each other. Email me for details.<p>And if you're looking for a co-founder in Silicon Valley, I recommend FoundersHookup.com. In the valley, there's an overabundance of business people with just an idea who are ""just looking for an engineer"". With FoundersHookup, biz folks are thoroughly screened first (and charged). Free for developers. As a technical founder myself, I do believe that if you can find the right biz cofounder, you'd may just never do another startup without the right biz cofounder first.

She said, basically, Nilfisk or Miele, whichever's on sale.<p>I asked about Dyson since I'd also been at least somewhat impressed by their marketing materials. The response was that while their performance is reasonable in a light use context, they are not at all durable and their use is unheard of in a commercial environment. They also have no commercial products, which is a red flag because while a company's marketing might be able to bamboozle consumers, the professionals are far less impressed with glossy brochures and only concerned with consistent performance, reliability and TCO. Nilfisk and Miele have commercial products.<p>That was pretty much ""case closed"" for my decision making process and I bought a Nilfisk. YMMV.",1302415750

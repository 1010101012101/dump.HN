169375,comment,168635,168635,0,0,nradov,,,"I'm not sure if I qualify as a ""hacker"", but I am a development manager for a small software company and hold an MBA from SCU. All of my prior experience had been in product development, so the MBA was useful primarily for gaining a broader perspective on other areas such as marketing, finance, and operations. It would have taken me much longer to learn the same things through work experience and self study.<p>If you do decide to pursue an MBA let me put a plug in for my alma mater. It's a good choice since you can work full time in Silicon Valley and then go to school nights and weekends.

169374,comment,169125,169125,0,0,edw519,,,"History repeats.  Web 2.0 will get into the enterprise the same way the PC did.  Through that back door.<p>IT directors wanted nothing to do with the PC.  It threatened their ivory tower.  But users wanted simple solutions to their problems without waiting years in the IT development queue.  Once they were able to buy a PC with spreadsheet software without higher budget approval, the ""man behind the curtain"" was exposed forever.<p>A generation later, it's all about to happen again, with or without the IT department.  Even if IT fights it by blocking sites users want to use, they'll get around it with proxies or by bypassing corporate networks.  You can't stop progress.  Enterprise IT departments would be better off in the long run by embracing what their users already know.",1208785819

Don't snack should have been ""don't eat packaged snack food"" because it's more likely to be junk.<p>So, we agree.  If you want to slice up some cucumber and dip some humus, that's probably fine.  If you're staring at a bag of chips, that's probably trouble.<p>One of the best methods to make snacking benign is to not stock anything unhealthy.  Like, if it's crap, don't buy it and then you won't have to worry about avoiding eating it at home later.",1208785019

Maybe I could understand his point of view better if the author explained explicitly why he was pessimistic about the future of web programming instead of just vaguely mentioning that skills have been lost and he has ""no reasons to be optimistic"".<p>I guess it's just a pet peeve of mine when people present an argument without actually taking the time to bring forward any specific reason for the stance they are taking.

169356,comment,169295,169295,0,0,justindz,,,"If you are a programmer and strongly left-brained (not always the same thing), I'd suggest tricking yourself into thinking you have a logical approach to interpersonal relationships and then going to social gatherings quickly before you over-analyze.<p>Step 1 - Read most of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Nlp-21-Days-Harry-Alder/dp/0749920300/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1208783416&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Nlp-21-Days-Harry-Alder/dp/0749920300/...</a> - this is NOT a good scientific book, but it seems to be good at convincing you to step outside your comfort zone.  Optionally, skip this step and do sit-ups and push-ups instead which will make you feel more confident and comes with a low price tag.<p>Step 2 - Practice on an opposite-gendered friend whom you have <i>no</i> romantic interest in.  If such a person does not exist, skip this step.<p>Step 3 - Attend social events.  These are easy to find: book groups, local music, free martial arts class.  Talk to people with no intent to ""hook up"" or even make friends.  And I don't mean ""tell yourself you're not interested so you'll have a better shot.""  I mean just talk to them.  Ask something about the event.  Ask what time it is (don't wear a watch or carry a cell phone).  You don't have to have a conversation.  You just have to communicate.  Likewise, anytime you eat at a restaurant require yourself to compliment at least one employee while you are there.<p>Step 4 - Rinse and repeat until you realize you're enjoying all of the events and you talk to random people with more ease.  As some of the comments have said, you can have great conversations talking about silly stuff that you don't care about if you enjoy the process of facilitating a good conversation.<p>Tips:<p>Don't drink unless you <i>know</i> your limit and have a pre-established track record for staying under your limit.  Otherwise, you will end up undoing all confidence building when you get hammered and embarrass yourself once.<p>Avoid drunk people.  They are a pain in the ass and will spill things on you.  Both of these tips are easy to stick to if you don't go where people are drinking.",1208784294

Most of us don't have great social skills because we don't participate in social events but even more so we don't pay attention when we're in these situations.  When you're in social group, push aside your latest paradigm and actually watch what other people are doing, its easy to pick out the people with the best interpersonal abilities.  Watch them but don't mimic, instead find similarities in yourself (your interpersonal muscles) and then start working them out.  Walk up to people and introduce yourself.

Some things I learned in my MBA program, like the time value of money, were at best, easily gleaned from dozens of books at Borders.

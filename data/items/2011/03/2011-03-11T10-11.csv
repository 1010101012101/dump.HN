If I recall correctly, he figured out the memory modules were light sensitive, and if exposed to a focused image, the image could be 'read' straight from memory. I THINK he mentioned part of this in his speech at Penguicon 2.0 (Novi, MI -- 2003)... Actually, he DID!!! I just found a recording of his speech:<p><a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/Penguicon_2.0_Terry_Pratchett_Guest_of_Honor_Speech_2003"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archive.org/details/Penguicon_2.0_Terry_Pratchett...</a><p>He starts talking about playing with the ZX-81 about two and a half minutes in, and at a little after five minutes, starts talking about making one ""that can see things."" This so impressed fellow guest Eric S. Raymond, that he came charging out of the banquet hall after the speeches to demand to hear more!<p>I had something of a front row seat to this conversation, as I'd already approached Mr. Pratchett to ask about how he'd wound up too radioactive to <i>enter</i> a nuclear facility (also mentioned in the speech, but kind of glossed over). So there I am on the inside of a crowd of onlookers as Terry's elaborating on the radiation story, with a flabbergasted ESR staring in disbelief, and each of us standing not much more than a meter from each other.<p>It was... an interesting experience.<p>I do wholeheartedly recommend that speech.

Suppose you get so many orders from France that you figure it makes more sense logistically to bulk ship items to a central location in France and then drop ship from there with the French office merely acting as a forwarding location. Surely this is roughly equivalent to the previous scenario.<p>6. Since demand from France is fairly predictable, you figure you can actually ship based on anticipated sales, shortening fulfillment time. Surely this is roughly equivalent to the previous scenario.<p>7. Since you realize the drop ship location is fairly close to many of your customers, you can offer a saving to the customer by allowing them to physically travel to the warehouse and collect their goods. Surely this is roughly equivalent to the previous scenario.<p>8. Since customers are frequently coming to pick up their orders, you realize you can neatly and logically order the items in your warehouse to facilitate easy retrieval of pickup orders. Surely this is roughly equivalent to the previous scenario.<p>9. Since people are coming into the warehouse, it makes no sense to force them to do the purchasing online when they could just wander through the warehouse, decide what they want and purchase right there and then.

Suppose you now figure out that it makes sense to advertise this warehouse space since people in the surrounding area could come in, wander through the aisles and make impulse purchases. Also, investing money in improving the physical appearance of the warehouse will also draw people in. Surely this is roughly equivalent to the previous scenario.<p>11. You figure out that it makes sense to place multiple warehouses in different places around the country since this will attract more people from that local area. Surely this is roughly equivalent to the previous scenario.<p>12. Given how logistically complicated this has become, you hire an entire French team who operate largely independently of the US parent office and manage the roll out of these fulfillment centers (they call them le store).

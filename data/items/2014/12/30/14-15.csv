It feels like the best parts of creative writing (since writing down what you&#x27;re going to do is somewhat like fantasy anyway), but without the wishy-washy unreferenced opinions of non-technical writing.

I think I actually enjoy it more than the technical work sometimes, and it&#x27;s certainly made my technical work much better planned.",1419951543

Less to install. Less to update. Ideally you only need to update the deployed application. Which in case of Go is that one binary.<p>Another big thing is that same app written in Go just takes (significantly) less RAM than when written in Java. Go has arrays (and slices) of structs, not just struct pointers (in Java-speak: object references). This also dramatically reduces short lived garbage. Additionally Golang strings consume less memory, as they are UTF-8 by default in memory.

8814775,comment,8807318,8813391,0,0,csandreasen,,,"> that limitations on querying them are enforced only at a policy level.<p>I love it when people throw this out.  Virtually every crime is enforced only at a policy level.  There are no technical limitations preventing a cop from going from door to door and using his issued weapon to kill everyone inside, but you don&#x27;t see people crying out to disarm cops to prevent it.<p>> The issue is not about whether there has been abuse. The issue is about the fundamental principles of freedom in our country against suspicion-less search and seizure.<p>It&#x27;s not suspicion-less - it&#x27;s done to answer specific questions: are any phone numbers on a given list of foreign terrorist numbers in contact with other phone numbers inside the US?  If so, which numbers are they in contact with?  It was implemented to address a specific fault found by the 9/11 Commission.  I&#x27;m personally comfortable with the information collected being used for <i>exactly</i> that purpose, and nothing else (although I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re going to come back and say you&#x27;re not).  That&#x27;s why in evaluating the program, it&#x27;s critical to look at whether the NSA has deviated from guidelines set down by the courts.  Neither of the two review groups recommended shutting down the program, they recommended keeping the phone records at the phone companies instead.<p>> First, it seems you agree with the parent? You don&#x27;t dispute him, just add an addendum about minimization.<p>I&#x27;m taking issue with cherry picking quotes to make a point.<p>> The issue is that the collection is done in the first place without a person being suspected of a crime. Their content can be collected, then it can be decided if they are suspect of a crime or not, and then it may possibly be released. This is principally different than how law enforcement is supposed to work in the United States.<p>This isn&#x27;t law enforcement, it&#x27;s foreign intelligence.  The document in question pertains to Section 702 collection, which is targeted against specific e-mail addresses/accounts/identifiers used by foreigners.  There already has to be a stated foreign intelligence purpose to collect against that specific address to begin with.  The document further goes on to direct analysts to destroy any collected information that pertains to US persons is not of foreign intelligence value.<p>> Another thing we learned from the Obama Administration oversight panel is that anything within three hops of a target is considered relevant for collection (and the hops are counted across Facebook, Twitter, AIM, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Gmail, phone, geolocation, etc).<p>There&#x27;s nothing in the PCLOB report that says that.  The report makes it pretty clear that the whole three hop process pertains to phone records.<p>> but I would also classify his statement as accurate<p>It&#x27;s inaccurate because he states that the NSA can hand attorney-client communications over to federal prosecutors, when the document he&#x27;s citing says the exact opposite.<p>> almost reads like... parallel construction...<p>How could it be parallel construction if the person is already indicted?  The entire point of that section is to protect client-attorney communications - if the purpose was to feed intelligence to US law enforcement by circumventing client-attorney privilege, why would they put in those additional restrictions?",1419951015

In order to use some function, you have to bundle and depend on a whole library. That library may have functionality you don&#x27;t need, which may make it reliant on other libraries, and so on. And if two of the libraries you depend on, in turn depend on different versions of some other library, you get dependency hell.<p>But libraries are just one level of fractal self-similarity. Packages bundle libraries and other supporting tools, so one package depends on others, containing tools and functionality you never use. And packages suffer the same dependency hell.<p>Then we invent even higher abstractions to make the dependency hell go away. Maybe Docker containers. But then what happens when you need assemblies of those? Pods of Containers?<p>This is a problem with the dynamic linkage model of code reuse. Not that static linkage solves the problem totally, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same dependency bloat, and dependency failures occur in the development phase, rather than during deployment (or worse, many months later).<p>So yeah, Cathedrals are more elegant, and better code.<p>But, so what?

Spray works hand-in-glove with the Scala type system; would, in fact, be impossible in a language without it.<p>> You also are glossing over a huge host of complexity around build/deployment. What jvm are you targeting? Is it on the servers you are deploying to? Are you going to make a fat jar? If not, how are you doing dependency resolution? Is your build artifact something that sbt does out of the box or slightly different (lord help you if it is)? Are you going to do ivy, s3, or maven resolution?<p>If you&#x27;re just playing around, you push the button in your IDE and it runs. If you&#x27;re a serious business you make these decisions once and reuse them in every project. (To answer your questions explicitly: the default is to build for java 1.6, which has been on servers since before go even existed; if you&#x27;re building for a newer version it&#x27;s because you know what you&#x27;re doing. My personal choice would be the maven appassembler plugin, but using the shade plugin to make a fat jar works fine too. I wouldn&#x27;t touch SBT, it&#x27;s too complex).<p>Yes, you do have to make some choices, put a bit of effort into deployment. But I think that&#x27;s a necessary cost, because it&#x27;s the only way to allow tooling to evolve. Imagine if ant had been built into the JVM back in 2000; maven would never have been able to replace it, so we&#x27;d be stuck with it forever. Look at the Python standard library; when Python first got big, it was this great selling point full of really useful tools. Now, it&#x27;s where modules go to die, because things that are built into the language can&#x27;t evolve at the same place as things that are outside it. I fear exactly the same thing will happen to the Go tooling (though of course, we won&#x27;t know one way or the other for ten years). If I can think of one language that really emphasised an &quot;easy deployment model&quot;, it&#x27;s PHP. Not only did that approach lead to terrible deployment practices, but now that the landscape has shifted and Apache is no longer universal the way it once was, it&#x27;s not even particularly easy to deploy PHP any more.",1419949577

8814609,comment,8812724,8814474,0,0,morganvachon,,,"True, but sometimes those &quot;breaks&quot; are good things (Vista to 7 was nothing but improvement). And generally, Microsoft will support their releases for longer than a decade. XP had over 13 years of extended support, and Windows 7 will have 11 years of extended support. Even Vista, one of the worst OS releases from Microsoft, is still in extended support for another two years.[1]<p>Contrast that to major (LTS) releases from Ubuntu, which can be from 3 to 5 years, and only 9 to 18 months for non-LTS releases.[2] And Ubuntu is one of the kings of bleeding-edge breakage in the Linux-based OS world, surpassed only by Arch in my experience.<p>All that said, it&#x27;s not all rosy in the Windows world, and not all thorns in the Ubuntu world. I just wanted to point out some facts to counter your misinformation.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/lifecycle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/lifecycle</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases</a>",1419948457

You try to maintain your profits as everyone else, but before customers/passengers/clients smartened up it was easy, now you have to sue and lobby but eventually you have to directly fight against the rights of your passengers (the FAA exit fee someone proposed).<p>Since airlines are a high barrier to entry market regulatory capture is both likely and a real concern, just as collusion (or an emergent cartel, after all this is a general problem of the business model).<p>So here to answer the question of what&#x27;s reasonable you&#x27;d have to know more about the operating costs and other dynamics of the market. But I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it turns out that simply forgoing that extra profit leads to a healthier market (cheaper fares, more passengers, bigger market altogether) - which is very likely, after all it is already profitable to do the A->B->C route for whatever they offer it, and if they offer it below costs, then that&#x27;s basically dumping which we know long term likely hurts the market because leads to fewer participants.",1419948229

I&#x27;m not under any illusions that the first part would change; my hope only pertains to the second part.<p>For example, the behaviour of null/nil references in most typed languages mentioned in the article has nothing to do the inherent nature of messy user requirements. Same goes for the lack of sum types: infact they&#x27;re perfect for modelling messy requirements, much better than simulating them with structs and forgetting a check somewhere (I&#x27;m just parroting the article here)<p>These issues aren&#x27;t caused by messy requirements but by messy leftovers from legacy languages. Thats fine too, nobody expects us to get it right the first time: but that was 40 years ago and repeating the same mistakes in languages made in 2009 feels really sad.",1419948182

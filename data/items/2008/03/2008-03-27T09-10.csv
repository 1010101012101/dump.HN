The advice of waiting 6 more months or just giving up because of what's outside of your control rubs me as something bordering on: You cannot do [dream] because you are just a [class|race].<p>And has anyone considered the cost of maintaining your ability once you've settled into the corporate world? Go for it while at the top of your game, if possible.",1206611841

But nobody is using it for that...people want Amazon's network and a cheap way to scale from zero to huge for websites.  Now that they've finally embraced that, if they'll just resolve the reliability issues, EC2 will be a fantastic hosting option.",1206611083

The oldest working developer I've ever worked with also happens to be the fellow that turned me on to Ruby AND Lua, when nobody on Reddit was talking about them (actually before reddit existed) and nobody else in the office was tinkering with them.  He just had a roving interest in technology and loved to play with new stuff.  But certainly even the nerdiest of sorts learns that there are some problems that can't be solved with code--and that does make a big difference in how one approaches running a business.",1206608590

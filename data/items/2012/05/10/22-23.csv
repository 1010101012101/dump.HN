If you ""agree that he should have been paid"" then you are agreeing that Miso has a <i>debt</i> to jshwu.

In my experience people proposing it tend to 'handle it' by simply ignoring it happened. As if by simply catching and not crashing you have averted disaster. Nevermind that very little, if any, code is truly exception safe. That exception just tore through N frames of code interrupting each one at who knows what step and who knows what kind of state the object is now in. If you were lucky they were at least using RAII objects to ensure they haven't leaked things, but that is only half the battle. Unless they are using some kind of transactional approach to mutating their own instance state you likely have an object in a 'half-transitioned' state, which will likley violate various invariants the original author assumed (incorrectly) would always hold. Continuing in C++ (or really any language)  after swallowing an exception 'around main' is a supremely bad idea, unless you like heisenbugs or getting pwned.",1336690354

The only difference between this and something I've seen a half-decade ago is that it's wireless communication between the pump and the sensor.<p>Maybe the software is a little better, maybe the sensors are a little smaller, but this isn't a step forward, it's just a step to the side.  You still will have to poke yourself with 2 needles (one for the sensor, one for the injector), just not as often.  You'll also have to wear this.  Call it vanity but my wife would like to wear a shirt without some weird lump under it.  A swimsuit might be right out.<p>Pumps are also prohibitively expensive, even with insurance.  We're talking about $8k for the pump itself and the about $500 per month for supplies (for current models).  Insurance usually covers about 20% of the pump cost but it will probably have to be replaced every 5 years.<p>There are more interesting things on the horizon like implanted glucose monitors[1][2].  Since diabetics eventually get used to the needles, they typically need a better way to know when they might need more insulin (or in some cases sugar).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.s4ms.com/products_glucose.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.s4ms.com/products_glucose.htm</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100728144347.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100728144347.ht...</a>",1336690093

The idea of a referral bonus is rewarding someone for /growing/ the team, and if you leave before that term is up, or if you leave before you file for the bonus, it's ridiculous to ask for it later especially when you've already deflated your good will with a company.

It's easier for me to eat the right foods AND eat the right amounts of those foods.<p>2) Meat is not made of sugar like high carbohydrate foods are. The protein of meat needs to undergo a slow metabolic process (gluconeogenisis) in order for my body to turn it into sugar. What this means is that my food is ""slow release"" energy (sugar) as opposed to an instant sharp spike in sugar. Predictability is key when you need to manually inject the correct amount of sugar consuming hormone after every meal.<p>This diet is also great for EVERYONE...

You should be allergic to any reason for not paying short of ""there is no credible claim to being owed this bonus"".<p>It's definitely true that bonus programs are usually intended for existing employees. Concrete example: my last employer blew out their numbers the year I left the company; I wound up in a 6 month transitional role (and a few additional months of outside consulting) after a cordial mutual understanding that I was going to leave. The whole company got a massive bonus. I got a negligible bonus, even though I was a full-time employee, and even though the bonus accounted for multiple years where I was a full-time, fully performant employee with no stated intention to leave.<p>Am I mad? Nope! Most of the (unstated) point of the bonus was employee retention. I was unretainable.

Someone willing to nuke something that their friends/coworkers built in this fashion is just not someone you ever want to hire. You find this kind of crap on Google, and you just don't call him back or offer an interview.<p>After all employers are human too, and when you delete the production db, make everyone pick up your mess, quit, and <i>then have the stones</i> to ask for your long-forgotten referral bonus for current employees in a chipper tone when you are already at another company...yeah, he's kind of a douche.<p>I'm sure he can be legalistic about it, and I'm sure there are no end of lawyers out there willing to huff and puff about the evil employer but...douche.",1336687315

There may well be lawyers who take employment law cases on a contingency basis, but there will also be ones who simply hire out their services in formal letterwriting on an hourly basis, broken down into six minute increments.  That is, overwhelmingly, the most common billing arrangement in the profession.  You might even find a lawyer willing to do that and defer the payment until after the check had been received, but I do not anticipate the legal bill here being a prohibitive amount of money for an American professional.",1336687281

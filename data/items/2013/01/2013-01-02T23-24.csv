Damn easy.<p>In fact, its already done: and right now, MOAI - and similar tools, just like it (Love2D, Cocos2D, &etc.) - are already out there, running on the existing OS's, and providing multi-touch interfaces that definitely compete with existing Frameworks/SDK's.  There is little that Cocoa does, for the 2D gamer/mobile developer, that MOAI cannot do, also. (Granted: native interfaces are a weakness, but then again: non-native, truly cross-platform UI's are a STRENGTH in the face of the existing market)<p>By making this move, Canonical has just invalidated all the proprietary bullshit the average Objective-C developer has to contend with, in order to develop an app for the mobile platform.  Same with Android - both Objective-C and Android investments have just been bumped down a few tens of points, in my opinion.  Why bother learning proprietary locked-in crap, when you can pick a framework that will run easily on all of the platforms, including the up and coming new Ubuntu-Mobile?<p>Where once we have over-specialization and a slavish devotion to technocratic dogma from an oppressive regime (Apple, and in lesser yet still significant ways, Android too), we now have a real ability to choose our tools and standardize on the ones with which we most feel comfortable.<p>Make no mistake, this is a genius move.

If you want to buy a car, you could buy a Ferrari or a Honda. You know those two cars are for different audiences. No one complains about the price of Ferraris; people understand that they are expensive. It's the same with ebooks; just like you can buy a cheap car or expensive car, you can buy a cheap [ebook] package or expensive package. If you think the expensive package is too expensive, it just means you are not the target audience. People think it's crazy that Nathan Barry is charging $200 for his ebook package; but they're not the target audience.

At best it seems like a misleadingly under-qualified description, e.g. ""one-time-if-the-consumer-successfully-acks-the-message"".<p>Ultimately dequeueing a message, doing work, and acking the message, involve multiple systems in a logical distributed transaction.<p>Regardless of any guarantees the queue makes, you will need to deal with the fact that the consumer can potentially perform an operation based on the message, and then the ack can fail due to any kind of communication failure between queue and consumer. Or the worker can die (permanently) immediately after performing the work but before performing the ack. Etc.  The message will be redelivered and the operation will occur again. As a result, you likely need to ensure that the operation in question is idempotent.<p>Given that you need to ensure this idempotency regardless of the queue's delivery semantics, I don't see what benefit it is for the queue to make any claims about one-time delivery.<p>What am I missing?",1357169868

You can either try to flag down one of the wait staff or send a text to the restaurant with ""#Table12 can you refill my coffee?"" The wait staff gets the text and delivers you a coffee refill. Notice, you sent off the asynchronous message and then continue talking with your friends instead of pausing the conversation to flag down staff. It translates to better service and a better dining experience because the timing matches your needs. Similar examples follow for anything you would flag a waiter down for.<p>IMHO, one of the more pressing problems is efficient communication within the restaurant.

We are looking to fill 3 positions:<p>Front-End/UI Engineer - Must have a good attention to detail and be able to use and contribute to a large, modular Javascript codebase (built on dojo). Good understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript is a must, and a good eye for design is a nice bonus. We support only modern browsers (no IE6 headaches), so we have a very rich HTML/Javascript interface that relies on AJAX queries to pull down data and perform much of the work.<p>Software Engineer - With just 2.5 programmers right now (our CEO has a CS PhD but a lot of other responsibilities), we all wear many hats. Our server is written in Java 7 and runs on the latest Jetty. We use Hibernate and Spring with annotation-based configuration (minimal XML). We use Lucene for indexing documents, Cassandra for logging and searching user events, MySQL for storing relational data, and it all runs on AWS technologies. We have a separate Python codebase for performing offline work. We strive to write all of our code in a modular, reusable style that maximizes code-sharing and minimizes repetition. We schedule weekly time for refactoring so that we avoid the accumulation of technical debt. If you're sharp and you're interested in learning how to write performant code that uses modern academic research and operates on the latest infrastructure, you'll like this role.<p>Systems Engineer - We deal with many terabytes of data. We just recently ordered a 48-bay fileserver (basically a more robust, beefed-up BackBlaze pod) to handle our expanding storage needs over the next couple years. We need someone with Unix experience who is comfortable in Python to help us work more efficiently. You'll manage our AWS installations, manage our internal systems, and help make our entire setup more robust. We're happy to hire someone with solid fundamentals who wants to learn on the job.<p>Salary is competitive with other Bay-area startups. We also offer equity, healthcare, 3 weeks of vacation and 10 holidays, and a relaxed and fun work environment.<p>We consider all applicants; please apply for the position(s) you're interested in at <a href=""http://easyesi.com/jobs.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://easyesi.com/jobs.shtml</a>.",1357168878

Pretty much any language other than c++ not just c#.</i><p>Do you mean ""shorter"" in the sense of fewer <i>characters</i>, or ""shorter"" in the sense of fewer <i>tokens</i>? I've found both to be true to some degree (the state of text processing in Cocoa is positively barbaric), but what people usually complain about is the former, and I can't agree that it's a problem.<p>I can understand why too much typing gets tedious, but I think as a criticism it's a red herring, because it's essentially the complaint that Objective-C tends to be descriptive. That's normally considered a good thing! With autocomplete, typing Objective-C isn't harder than typing code in any other language, and the descriptive names help when reading unfamiliar code. I can come across a method call in somebody else's Objective-C codebase and instantly understand what each argument is and does without having to jump around and look at definitions.<p>If you actually mean you have to do more, though, I think that's one of those things that varies a lot from program to program.

The OP is advocating that the company close their doors sooner, on their own terms, voluntarily. This would, according to the OP, good for the economy, though not good for Microsoft. I think we are seeing capitalism at work: Microsoft has run it's course, and is now just trudging along. It cannot pivot, and cannot turn back to a time when the software industry allowed it to flourish. In time, it will stumble, fall down and never get up.

When you call a method like `Forum.find_by_url('news.ycombinator.org')` it gets a first forum with such url. This is a sugar over `Forum.where(:url => 'news.ycombinator.org').first`.<p>Normally, you use it like that `Forum.find_by_url(params[:url])` where `params` is a hash of parameters (that is auto-generated from http get/post params). What happens if instead of ""normal"" value like ""news.ycombinator.org"" you pass a hash?<p><pre><code>    1.9.3p327 :018 > Forum.find_by_id({:select => 'id FROM forums --'})
    Forum Load (0.5ms)  SELECT id FROM forums -- FROM `forums` WHERE `forums`.`id` IS NULL LIMIT 1

Uh-oh.<p>However, not everything is lost. Rails params are converted to a special hash class. It's called HashWithIndifferentAccess, because you can access its values by string keys and symbol keys likewise. So that<p><pre><code>    h = {:a => 1, ""b"" => 2}.with_indifferent_access

    h[:a]  # => 1
    h[""b""] # => 2

What happens if we pass user-generated params? It seems like not much:<p><pre><code>    1.9.3p327 :024 > Forum.find_by_id({:select => 'id FROM forums --'}.with_indifferent_access)

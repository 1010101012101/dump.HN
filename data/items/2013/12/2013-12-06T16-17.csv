I&#x27;ll bet that most teachers, if shown your quote, would retch.</i><p>I assume you have read John Taylor Gatto&#x27;s works before. In particular, you might be interested in his most recent: <i>Weapons of Mass Instruction</i>.<p>I don&#x27;t know how exactly you would gauge their influence. It&#x27;s certainly much more prevalent in certain countries (the USA and the major Western European forces, where the idea of modern compulsory schooling originated in the first place: Prussia), compared to say, Eastern European countries. The national psychology has always been different there, and after being ravaged by communism, the school system is quite chaotic and ineffectual, though the EU and other powers are trying to enact change (not necessarily for the better).<p>In any event, just look at how the classroom model of schooling works these days: intense focus on rote memorization, adherence to ritualistic and often obsolete or pointless standards, very bureaucratic operation and government, a fanatical concern with and faith in the grading system, standardized testing as the be-all-end-all of education and so on.<p>Then depending on the country, schools are used to instill nationalistic and other forms of propaganda, be it in the history textbooks or throughout the entire atmosphere of the classroom. Typically most states do this, though the exact level and subtlety depends on the individual nation.<p>The teachers would likely retch, but they&#x27;re just as big of pawns as anybody else. They&#x27;re not meant to know. They&#x27;re told to serve a seemingly benevolent purpose in educating the nation&#x27;s youth, and they must obviously comply with whatever they&#x27;re given if they&#x27;d like to keep their job.",1386349121

You wouldn&#x27;t want to buy gas based on the high or the low of the day. So you can&#x27;t say that Gas costs 1/300th of a Coin, and leave that as the price all day because right now that could be Cheap at $900 a coin and Expensive at $1300 a coin.<p>It also says that there has to be enough people using it for it to not have huge price swings based on Volatility. This also makes sense. We don&#x27;t buy things with gold often because knowing the value at a given moment is hard. And since we don&#x27;t trade in raw gold we trade in coins, typically those coins each have values, a Krugerand and a Panda don&#x27;t have quite the same value per ounce and the difference fluctuates per day. So unless we can get to a point that BTC is only changing fractional percentages per day, people are going to always be changing coins to local currency.<p>All of this summarized in one sentence:<p>BoA ML thinks that BitCoin will become a Merchant Services System that works on the instantaneous exchange rate with the local currency, and based on the market share they believe it could have and the total number of coins in circulation the cap will be $1300.

6862052,comment,6861599,6861599,1,0,gtaylor,,,"The recently released X: Rebirth sure gives these games a run for their money. Unlike some of the games listed, dev time for X was around 7 years. We can&#x27;t say that the game was re-arranged in the last hour (like that Superman game). The general consensus is that the publisher said &quot;enough is enough&quot; and forced a release.<p>X is a bit of a niche series (Hyper-detailed, hyper-complex 4X), but X: Rebirth was supposed to be a much more accessible re-invention.

6862048,comment,6861533,6861533,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"I suppose what has happened to my HN account (artificially high latency, aka &quot;slowbanning&quot;, and personal penalties in comment placement, aka &quot;rankbanning&quot;) proves this. If you actually challenge VC-istan (as opposed to Graham-esque incremental improvements) on its moral fundamentals, you&#x27;ve gone too far.<p>More generally, creativity (in particular, I&#x27;ll focus on social humor) has a status effect. Let&#x27;s put social status on a scale from -1.0 to 1.0. Below 0.0, you&#x27;re an at-risk member who may be expelled from the group. At 1.0, you&#x27;re an unquestioned god-king of it (most groups&#x27; leaders are 0.5 to 0.7).<p>When you&#x27;re above +0.4, you can&#x27;t really use humor (which I&#x27;m taking to be a microcosm of creativity) except of a stunted kind, because most good humor is partisan or offensive, and not &quot;presidential&quot; or &quot;leader-like&quot;. That, I would argue, applies to creative expression in general.<p>Below 0.0, you&#x27;re a disliked member of the group and your ideas (or humor) will be rejected just because they come from you and are therefore taken to be unskilled displays and desperate attempts to improve status. Between 0.0 and +0.2, your jokes might be well-received, but it&#x27;s not worth the risk, because you don&#x27;t have much status capital to spend. This leaves a narrow range of the status spectrum-- 0.2 to 0.4-- in which humor (/creativity) can bring improvement. However, people at +0.3 to +0.4 aren&#x27;t high enough to end up climbing corporate ladders-- you need +0.6 to +0.7 to play that game, and you need to achieve that status reliably (at each level of the executive hierarchy)-- and doubling down on humor typecasts you as &quot;the funny guy&quot;, which isn&#x27;t the image you want and limits you at the +0.4 ceiling.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t really that <i>people</i> individually dislike creativity. It&#x27;s that social groups become increasingly anti-intellectual and focused on self-preservation (which requires excluding the &quot;different&quot;) as they get bigger.",1386349012

For one, humans are high on the food chain and in turn may not be as robust as say roaches, but we can construct pretty much everything. We will evolve and change, but the extinction of the human race would require several Unprecedented events. Even a large meteorite striking Earth would have trouble killing off humanity (obviously if it&#x27;s big enough...). Furthr, algae reduce carbon much MUCH more efficiently than plants and can reproduce much faster. Even more we already have processes of turning algae to oil (although the oil is of poor quality). All that being said the more carbon dioxide is released the quicker/more algae will grow and the more oxygen and oil can be produced.

People go to them when they are making a buying decision and if they click on the product link after reading the review, it drops a cookie and in many cases they will buy that same session anyway.<p>Price comparison or deal sites are also kind of in the same end point of the buying cycle. The person has already decided to buy a particular item, so whoever can offer the best deal or whoever has the best bonus item/service/brand is going to probably make the sale.<p>By being on HN, there are probably a lot more people looking for your particular solution than just the average reddit reading programmer.

Many educational leaders recognize the issue. But at the same time there are even more discussions about Common Core standards and other ways to standardize education. Sometimes both conversations come from the same people.<p>I was at a conference this fall, with two session at the same time, in rooms right next to each other -- one promoting why the Common Core is the greatest thing ever, the other denouncing it. Both sessions were equally full, and both sessions got the worst reviews of the entire conference, mostly because the people are so conflicted about how to deal with innovation and creativity vs standardization.<p>It is a problem that is easy to identify, but much more difficult to fix. People are trying. For example, Khan academy is a great resource for independent learning, but even their elementary math lessons are categorized by traditional grade levels.<p>The best solution I have to improve creativity in the American educational system is to educate the parents. Make sure that all parents are aware of the issues, and make sure that all parents know that the education of their children is not in the hand of their local school district, but in their own hands. They need to understand the pros and cons of all schooling options, and make the right decisions for their children, and include their children in those discussions when they get old enough.<p>I know this is a huge tangent away from the original article, but this strikes a bit of a nerve with me, and I agree with you that education is an arena in which the issue of creativity is vitally important, probably moreso than in the workplace.",1386348301

We have also made significant advancements in crop yields, etc. Of course, by the time those power sources are so widespread, there will be much more pollutants in the atmosphere from fossil fuel power sources, so who knows.<p>Anyone have a future that is a little more rosy than this?

If we were talking about a flea market, Kickstarter would be the company that rents out spots, not the guy selling you a shady DVD.<p>It might be possible to set up something like a store <i>using</i> Kickstarter, and then to defraud people who participate. If I promise to try to build you a smartwatch and I was always planning to send you a brick wrapped in tinfoil, I&#x27;ve probably committed civil and criminal fraud. The court won&#x27;t much care whether it&#x27;s a &quot;store,&quot; only whether I lied to get the money. But that&#x27;s on me, not on Kickstarter -- federal law says that online marketplaces aren&#x27;t (necessarily) liable for fraud. See the unsuccessful lawsuits against eBay, Google AdSense, and Orbitz: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230_of_the_Communications_Decency_Act#False_information\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230_of_the_Communicati...</a><p>It&#x27;s certainly possible for an online marketplace to become party to fraud if it&#x27;s sufficiently involved, and I have no idea where that line is drawn. I am not your lawyer and this is not legal advice. That citation above could be totally wrong and those cases were probably made up by rogue Wikipedia editors. Your intuitions will be closer, though, if you think of Kickstarter as the marketplace rather than the store.<p>(As a side note, let me repeat that the law doesn&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s a &quot;store&quot;; the question is whether people are being misled about the relevant facts when they decide to put money down. When people say &quot;Kickstarter is a store,&quot; the legal argument would probably be &quot;projects hosted on Kickstarter tend to mislead people who contribute money about the nature of the transaction, and the website&#x27;s design encourages that.&quot; I know legal definitions aren&#x27;t everything, but good ones tend to be handy even in non-legal settings, because they strip away hard-to-define words like &quot;store&quot; and replace them with easy-to-define words like &quot;transaction&quot; and &quot;website&quot;.)",1386348127

Very annoying to implement (and other similar protocols implementations&#x27; do not all agree!), and no benefit. Unless you&#x27;re composing HTTP headers to read on a 80-column layout. And that kind of thing has no place in a computer protocol.<p>Comments. Seriously read this from the spec:<p><pre><code>  Comments can be included in some HTTP header fields by surrounding\n  the comment text with parentheses. Comments are only allowed in\n  fields containing &quot;comment&quot; as part of their field value definition.\n  In all other fields, parentheses are considered part of the field\n  value.\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s even more bizarre. It further makes parsing need to know which header it is operating on. It just adds possibility for mis-implementation, security issues (confused deputy) and hurts performance.

Probably, that computation should be easy to verify using the various Bitcoin websites.<p>One thing I like to point out is that right now mining is over-subsidized by the basic protocol: why is the block reward 25btc (or whatever it is now)? It&#x27;s completely arbitrary and is paying the miners more than their services are worth (hence the arms race to earn as much of the reward as possible).<p>The point of mining is to secure the blockchain and render it infeasible to perform double-spends, right? But double-spends are not <i>that</i> disastrous: a few double-spends are an inconvenience and not a disaster for Bitcoin. There is no need to allocate 25btc a block to achieve the current record of close to zero successful double-spends. It is wasteful.<p>So as the block reward declines, we&#x27;ll see more reasonable amounts of revenue flowing to miners and hence also a decline in how much computing power (electricity) is spent, eventually converging on what is optimal for securing the blockchain.",1386346930

The Mac users I know talk about and complain about Mac OS probably more than any other topic I hear them talk about, nearly as much as sports fans talk about sports.<p>I&#x27;m really just jealous that the people I know don&#x27;t all use Linux and aren&#x27;t as passionate about it. :-/ But there&#x27;s a certain blindness when you&#x27;re the fan to how much you fan out about things.",1386346192

Unfortunately for reasons relating to how responses are altered in relation to the UA string this is not possible.<p>My product features the word &#x27;test&#x27; in the name. Some server-side services return a 404 or a 500 if the UA string contains &#x27;test&#x27; in any form. Due to this I can&#x27;t include the full product name in the UA string and expect all tests for all end users to work in cases where they really should. Some others respond similarly is the UA string is only &#x27;agent&#x27;.<p>The number of services that respond in a different manner to a blank UA string is significant. Likewise for cases where the UA string is not somewhat similar to that of common browsers.<p>On a related subject, I&#x27;d love it if everyone supported the simple HEAD method consistently.<p>Some services respond as expected and return only the response headers. Some services respond fairly with either a &#x27;405 Method Not Allowed&#x27; or &#x27;501 Not Implemented&#x27;, giving me the option to try again with an equivalent GET request. Some services send a 404 or 500 in response to a HEAD  in cases where the equivalent GET request works just fine.<p>And lastly, <a href=\"https://myspace.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://myspace.com/</a> responds with nothing when making a HEAD request and you have to wait for the request to time out in cases where an equivalent GET works just fine.",1386346135

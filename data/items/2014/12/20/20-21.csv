They&#x27;ve reduced CPI and improved ILP a lot in 16 years, not to mention vastly improved various forms of prediction, caching and speculation. A lot of the performance improvement gleaned from modern compilers will be better reduction of the C++ language itself, e.g. smarter inlining, LTO, devirtualisation etc.",1419109195

You&#x27;re correct in saying that he does not elaborate or contridict the FBI statement, but it should also be noted that neither does he endorse it.

First, I finally found a firm financial footing. I&#x27;ve a job I&#x27;m not worried about losing and no desire anymore to jump into Startups-ville.<p>Second is the 2014 Mazda3. I just don&#x27;t like any of the other cars, they&#x27;ve all just got really boring styling. I can&#x27;t see what the value proposition between buying say, a Ford Focus vs. a Hyundai Elantra. If I&#x27;m going to spend $X0,000 on something that fills a need I can fill with $X,000, it better offer a lot of added value, and I just wasn&#x27;t seeing it. The 2014 Mazda3 just looks fantastic and is a lot of fun to drive. I feel good getting into it. People compliment me all the time on it. It&#x27;s not a Tesla, but I can&#x27;t afford a Tesla.<p>When I bought my car, I saved up for 6 months and had the car I wanted picked out before I ever walked in. I&#x27;m having a hard time seeing anyone that&#x27;s in the position to buy a big ticket item coming out from  a recession doing it any other way.

Besides the capital and compliance parts, property insurance is also fairly labor-intensive, requiring a large organization to do it on a national basis (let alone international).

Now they&#x27;re having to subsidize more directly, and even then the cost difference between the Chinese stuff and the American stuff isn&#x27;t that large -- imposing tariffs on China wont make the panels that much more expensive, they&#x27;ll only cause them to be made in the US.",1419108279

But this is actually the kind of email we&#x27;re trying to prevent. I usually refer to it as &quot;The Other Spam.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve had multiple users of ours talk about how they tried starting newsletters to resurrect dropped users but got more unsubs/spam reports than renewals. Some even got hit up by their ESPs for a spike in spam reports affecting their domain credibility. There should probably be a more prominent section on this, but we do talk about it in our blog a lot.<p>Here&#x27;s what I usually say:<p>1) Always have a separate opt-in for product updates, off by default, ideally with some sense of frequency. Failing that, send product updates only to paying/active customers.<p>2) If you have an onboarding drip campaign, once it runs its course, if they haven&#x27;t engaged, let them go.<p>3) From there on, all other communications should pretty much be transactional, sent to the opt-in group, or based on some pre-qualification that the user is still interested.<p>These are all things that we try and make really simple in our product and exercise ourselves. Part of sending better email is just not sending the shitty ones.<p>On the personal side, I also just add tags to my email address when I sign up for something knowing that I&#x27;m just poking around so I can easily filter their follow-ups.

If you regularly rent out your property short-term (when I lived in Santa Cruz, CA, a lot of people did), whether it&#x27;s as a B&B, whole-property rental, boarding house, or anything similar, you typically need a completely different kind of insurance from regular homeowner&#x27;s insurance.

I&#x27;ve personally used their reference designs to make arduino-compatible boards, so I&#x27;m positive that all the information is available.<p>I&#x27;m still at a loss as to why you believe that Arduino is not <i>real</i> open source? Is it just because they didn&#x27;t put a BOM on the website alongside the schematic?",1419105691

That of course is likely to reverse as fast as it surfaced. Politics move slower than quarterly results however, and the tariffs have likely been planned or lobbied for, for years.",1419105646

The world has known the U.S. was torturing people during Bush for more than a decade by now. That&#x27;s the whole reason terms like &quot;waterboarding&quot; are in our lexicon. Likewise Obama publicly eliminated the use of torture on his second full day in office, after running on a public campaign of banning torture during his Presidential run.<p>Choosing to exchange a report that is only a &#x27;source of heat and light&#x27; for a serious cyberhacking incident that demonstrates the weakness of U.S. options vs. North Korea isn&#x27;t really an upside for the U.S. government as far as I can tell.<p>Extortion and blackmail from state actors is <i>precisely</i> the thing the U.S. government is supposed to protect U.S. persons and corporations from, so a U.S. admission that North Korea has managed to &quot;reach out and touch Sony Pictures&quot; is bad news for the U.S. government, not good news.",1419105644

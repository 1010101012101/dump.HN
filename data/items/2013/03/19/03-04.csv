5398821,comment,5397255,5398596,8,0,Moocar,,,"I was at Clojure/west today where Pedestal was unveiled. Here are some answers that I picked up:<p>- Pedestal doesn't deal with the DB. I just grepped for datomic on the codebase and found nothing. Relevance is one half of Datomic so it's not surprising they've used it in their example docs.<p>- The idea is to use clojure across the entire stack. As a clojure developer, this is fantastic. It also uses EDN as it's wire format.<p>- I'm not sure how far the composability goes but I get the impression that it's one of their design goals.<p>- The routing syntax looks pretty simple to me.<p>I don't get the opinion that this is Rails for Clojure. It's dealing mainly with asynchronous real-time client server communication with some great client additions. It doesn't enforce any kind of DB integration such as DB migrations which have always been one of Rail's killer features to me.",1363665466

I think coming into the tech world with the attitude that men need to be stood up to and knocked down is just going to come across to many of us as the same bullying attitude we grew up with. I think if most women in tech sat down with just about any neckbeard I can think of, they would be amazed at how friendly and awesome we are. We are not ""the man"" you're trying to overcome. We're simply people, who program, and we are happy that other people are entering the field. And really, we don't want to be crass or offensive.

I made quite a few single module programs, games, learnt bits of a lot of different things - x86 assembly language, openGL, +ORCs How to crack tutorials, GTK+ and QT for Linux etc etc. \nI studied Electrical Engineering in college and pretty much stopped programming all of a sudden. I had lost focus completely. The courses were ""okay"", but I never felt really curious like the way I felt whenever i spent time programming.<p>After college I took a job in an ""IT services"" company and stuck to ""maintaining"" COBOL programs for over 5 years.<p>And then suddenly about a year and half back, I woke up to the fact that I had pretty much wasted 9 years .<p>I convinced my manager that I wanted to move to Java because I hadn't done much more that IF ELSE END-IF in COBOL over the 5 years! I learnt Java, familiarized myself with the Java EE stack - got interested in Object Oriented thinking, spent time trying out smalltalk. Thought smalltalk was so awesome, that made me explore some more. On the way I discovered Haskell, functional programming, Lisp and and most recently Clojure.<p>So, looking back at the last 1.5 years - I feel I am in a little bit better place, but still can't imagine why I wasted the previous 9.<p>I haven't made any great pieces of software, yet - so I am quite not there. The more I read, the more I come to feel that taking a Computer Science course at college would have given me so much of the theoretical grounding I feel I lack now.

Agencies can say: ""Share anything potentially cyber-crime-related with us, companies, and you'll get blanket immunity, for not just the sharing but all 'decisions' made from the info we give you."" Zero risk from sharing, and possibly wind up on law enforcement's 'shit list' for withholding? That makes wide sharing the only thinkable option for risk-minimizing companies.<p>The terms ""cyber threat"" and ""cybersecurity crime"" are very expansively defined in the bill text previously referenced (<a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr3523/text"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr3523/text</a>). It looks to me like every federal crime where a computer is involved is covered, including unauthorized acquisition of copyrighted material. The lawyers at the EFF and elsewhere also seem to think CISPA will be usable in intellectual property investigations and prosecutions. What's your reference that it's not?<p>The Swartz prosecution wasn't about mere ToS-violations and it's disingenuous of you to suggest that. ToS violations aren't even mentioned in the original Swartz indictment (<a href=""http://web.mit.edu/bitbucket/Swartz,%20Aaron%20Indictment.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/bitbucket/Swartz,%20Aaron%20Indictment.pd...</a>). Swartz's actions, and Auernheimer's, were prosecuted under the CFAA, and the CFAA is specifically named in the CISPA bill text as one of the definitional sources for applicable 'cybersecurity crimes'.<p>You're giving an awful lot of weight to what prosecutors and law-enforcement say this bill will do. But they tend to <i>downplay</i> new powers when they're being discussed, and then <i>expansively interpret</i> them after passage (and until yanked back by the courts). That's why the EFF and ACLU -- expert organizations who actually fight court cases under this sort of vague language -- should be trusted on matters of practical effects once passed.<p>And given how bills can expand through amendments to include law enforcement wishlist items at any time, the suggestion that this bill needs no well-funded opposition makes it more likely it will grow into something even worse, via amendment or expansive interpretation. The warnings from privacy advocates that you're criticizing, on the other hand, help make sure CISPA will fail or be better-limited through the amendment process.",1363664450

Anyone with a rate that high is basically a for-profit business at this point, and with that income level, I'm not too worried about them having to register.

Apparently, the gene first evolved in the Near East, possibly tied to first domestication of the auroch and then spread radially from there into Europe.

5398669,comment,5397629,5398159,10,0,electronvolt,,,"Using your marathon analogy:<p>A marathon is usually run in about four and a half hours.  The best marathon runners in the world (i.e. current record holders) ran one in about 2 hours.<p>The university that I'm at has about 45-48 hours of classroom instruction per semester; you're expected to spend between two and three times that preparing; that's an assumption of between 135 and 192 hours of work per semester.  I find that for my upper level mathematics courses (first year graduate), I spend about 2-3 hours outside of class working on problem sets and reading the material. This is also, as far as I can tell, about how much the other students in my courses are working. My understanding is that this is the expectation across most high tier universities and math programs.<p>If we assume that the average marathon runner is roughly equivalent to a normal mathematics student in terms of experience, saying that you learned (and completely understood the implications of) an entire semester of mathematics in a day (16-20 hours) is equivalent to claiming you are able to run a marathon in 40 minutes.  For the record, that's a rate of about 1 mile every minute and a half.<p>This is an imperfect metaphor, since math has the same benefits that CS has of being able to absorb material faster the more you already know.  On the other hand, my experience (and what most professors I have asked also say) is that most hard math requires a sort of 'processing' time to really start to get it, so the actual case might be worse:  I don't think you'd actually learn much math if you just spent 135 consecutive hours (with sleep as required) working on learning math.<p>Suffice to say:  I don't think what he claimed to do is within the realm of reason.<p>Personal bio, as to why I'm a semi-reputable source:  I'm currently both finishing an undergraduate degree in mathematics and a masters in math at highly ranked public university (in general and in math).  Most of my time is currently spent learning math, either in class or self taught (for a seminar).  The professors I interact with regularly are about as mathematically talented as it is possible to get.<p>----<p>The above being said:<p>I would, however, say that someone with a good handle on multivariable calculus and differential equations, along with a really good background in math, could learn a decent amount of applied differential geometry in a weekend. Similarly, you could learn/memorize a lot of the results of number theory in a weekend.<p>Both of the above could give you the illusion of having learned all of a subject without building a deep understanding of it. Both are also in line with the 'hacker tendency' to be able to stuff a lot of information in your head in a short amount of time. The computer science equivalent would be learning that there exists an algorithm called quicksort that runs in O(nlog(n)) that doesn't work well on sorted data without modification, but without learning how to implement it.<p>The take away is that it's very easy to fool yourself into thinking you've learned a lot from a math book when you're reading it like a novel. In practice, though, if you aren't doing the exercises (or if they don't exist, working through your own), then you probably aren't actually engaging with the material in any deep and significant way.<p>I actually think this is in line with many of his other claims: he seems to be a person who seems to believe he has learned everything important about a field in a relatively short amount of research time, without having a deep background in it already, either through reading a single textbook or by spending a few hours/days/weeks researching and reading.

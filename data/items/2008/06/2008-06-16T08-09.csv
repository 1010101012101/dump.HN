To most people, steel is steel. You can use steel from any supplier in any project that requires it. But to some people, particularly engineers and material scientists in very specific applications, the different makes of steel become more important.<p>So one person's commodity may be another person's brand. I think the point of the article is to encourage producers to work to shift the trend towards brand, to their advantage.",1213606765

218501,comment,218382,218410,0,0,paulsilver,,,"Agreeing with one of the options above - one of my friends who works with a lot of startups will take a lower hourly rate in exchange for equity, depending on the startup. I think the deal is he gets 1% of equity for X amount of hours worked, with an hourly rate a chunk lower than he normally works at. He seems happy with the deal and the client's happy with his work.<p>As a freelancer, I've been asked to work just for equity on various projects. Normally this is by people who have a poor business idea and often no real clue about how to implement their side (i.e. the business and marketing) side of the idea. So if you ask a freelancer about working for equity, even if it's a split deal with some money, please understand that you're going to need to sell them the idea just as you would any other investor. iamdave it sounds like you're not in this exact situation as you all ready know the guy.",1213606424
218500,comment,218460,218497,0,0,babul,,,"As mentioned in the article, this is analogous to Facebook, and although the idea is it will help Selling Manager take off as a platform (those who have used it know how bad it is) and at the same time remove the appeal of other third-party selling tools/services, the question I want to know is how does eBay intend to rewards these developers?<p>Will it offer commissions, access to user data,  allow advertisements in the tools (like facebook), as it is notoriously monopolistic, greedy, and uncompromising and from my experience of eBay it is not in its nature to do such things.",1213606421
218499,comment,218468,218468,0,0,babul,,,"As someone who is does some contracting my suggestions would be...<p>A). Ask/call around your network/contacts and get information direct. This may also land you a job too.<p>B). Ring around the leading job agencies in the area you intend to work and ask what they can offer you based on your experience and skill set. This will give you a rough idea of what you can expect in terms of work and pay.<p>C). I would couple this with a look at the internet job sites and drill down to your area/market. This should give you a much more objective and clearer idea of the economy and rates too (you can gauge contract rates based on rates for full time positions). Plus the job adverts also give a good indication of the sort of skills the markets want at that time too (e.g. if you know .NET/J2EE/RoR/etc and the most money is in .NET work, then if money is your main driving factor you know you will do well to brush up on the .NET skills).<p>Sites like <a href=""http://www.vault.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vault.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/london/microsoft.do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itjobswatch.co.uk/jobs/london/microsoft.do</a> as well as the usual job-boards are good places to start.<p>Hope this helps.",1213606273

218495,comment,218021,218334,0,0,asdflkj,,,"Food and medicine programs are making the standard of living higher in the short term and lower in the long term. That was exactly my point: if you want to feel good, then short term is important. If you want to solve real problems, like unsustainable birthrates, then long term is important. We don't actually disagree.<p>If we had enough money to bootstrap the whole (or part) of Africa into a decent way of life, it would be one thing. But we don't. And half-measures are worse than nothing. If you don't have enough strength to lift an injured person over a fence, picking him up and dropping him back down won't do any good. But, it'll look like you're trying if you squint hard enough.",1213604541

218490,comment,217914,218270,0,0,axod,,,"In the UK, SMS is pretty well used, very cheap, and does not only go point to point. You can specify a list of destinations in each message.
Phone carriers like O2 routinely send SMS out to their entire customer base announcing new offers/deals (Unless you text stop).
Football announcements - if you opt in, as soon as a goal is scored, they send SMS messages out to thousands of interested fans instantaneously.<p>I used to run a ringtone website and dealt with these sorts of things.<p>Perhaps SMS is slow and unreliable in the US, but not in europe. Each message has with it a message longetivity which says how long it should stick around in the system trying to deliver itself. Also you have successful send notifications for that rare instance a message could not be delivered.",1213603820

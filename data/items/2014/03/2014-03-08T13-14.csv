In this case the literal translation of &quot;war game&quot; does not exist because to the German ear those two words must be expressed in a way that suggests a relationship between them. The additional &quot;s&quot; accomplishes that, in essence the phrase becomes a contraction of Krieg&#x27;s-Spiel (apostrophe added for better readability) which is a special short form that developed from &quot;Spiel des Kriegs&quot; or, translated, &quot;game of war&quot;.<p>That said, as a project name Kriegspiel is totally fine. :)",1394287071

When she only had one suspect left, then that person was clearly the Satoshi Nakamoto who created Bitcoin.<p>The author didn&#x27;t (claim to) assume that the probability that &#x27;Satoshi Nakamoto&#x27; was a pseudonym was zero, and that therefore the only non-pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto left standing had to be the Bitcoin inventor. Rather she assumed (or claimed to assume) that the probability that &#x27;Satoshi Nakamoto&#x27; was <i>not</i> a pseudonym was substantially above zero, and that therefore the only non-pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto left standing was worth detailed investigation, beginning with an in-person doorstopping. From that she, supposedly, got a direct oral admission from Dorian Sakamoto; she then followed up with further investigation which turned up several pieces of supposedly good circumstantial evidence supporting the claim (including the supposed similarities of English style and coding style) as well as one obvious piece of circumstantial evidence against it (where&#x27;s the money?). Based on all this she wrote up the story which identified Dorian as the Bitcoin inventor, but also gave prominence to the where&#x27;s-the-money problem. Now there <i>are</i> all sorts of potential problems there.

7365140,comment,7359992,7363212,1,0,nzp,,,"> Are you saying we should be able to simply stop there and then just use /dev/urandom?<p>Yes.<p>> If so, then why is the CSRNG re-seeded every 60 seconds? It would seem that there are reasons for doing so.<p>From what I understand about it (IANACryptographer), mostly to safeguard against situations where an attacker can learn the internal state of the CSPRNG at one moment.  But I don&#x27;t think this is too relevant for the problem at hand.<p>The only difference in Linux between /dev/random and /dev/urandom is that /dev/random always plays a guessing game about the seed entropy.  The main argument here is, I guess, that this is a silly game.  How can you really estimate entropy?  It doesn&#x27;t only depend on what physical sources in the machine give you, but also on what the attacker knows or can know about these sources and the state of the machine.  How do you estimate that?<p>This was the main motivation behind the Fortuna CSPRNG by Schneier, Ferguson and Kelsey.  There is no guessing going on, rather the algo is designed to not need to guess.  Interestingly, the way Fortuna works seems to me would also somewhat mitigate the kind of attack DJB talks about in the article referenced by OP[1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.cr.yp.to/20140205-entropy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cr.yp.to/20140205-entropy.html</a>",1394286481

7365131,comment,7364908,7364908,21,0,GuiA,,,"Awesome write up.<p>Without realizing it, I&#x27;ve been doing the same &quot;CD trick&quot;. I play the Monstercat album mixes (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/MonstercatMedia"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/user/MonstercatMedia</a> - dubstep, which , regardless of its musical merits, I find conducive to focusing and not trailing off) and see how many I go through in the day. I also like albums because they&#x27;re about an hour long, which I use as one-hour long pomodoro timers. 20 minutes is just way too short for me to truly focus.<p>I also really like the attitude that if you&#x27;re not touching code, you&#x27;re not doing real work. Sure, project managers etc. will say that your job is not solely to write code, and that responding to emails, participating in meetings with your teammates, etc. are as much part of your job. But I like the simplicity of &quot;if you&#x27;re not writing code, you&#x27;re fucking off&quot; and how easy it makes it to answer the question &quot;Did I work today?&quot;.<p>The other points are spot on. I suspect a lot of engineers are of the ADHD-type personality (the fact that &quot;yak shaving&quot; is a thing in our jargon is a good sign of that IMO), and a key part of addressing it is to learn how to spot when you go off track (zoning off and going on Twitter when the bug is getting a bit too hard to track down, stopping what you&#x27;re doing because a random question popped into your head and you just have to read the related Wikipedia article, etc.) so that you can correct yourself. Don&#x27;t feel bad about it- just learn how to catch it early, and stop doing it.<p>I heard a talk a while back where the speaker was driving home the fact that we need to get used to the fact that we should do things regardless of whether we feel like doing them or not. It sounds super dumb and like the ultimate first world problem, but thinking about it hard made me realized how skewed my perspective was. I feel like our culture at large really leads us to believe that we should only do things we like and enjoy; &quot;I don&#x27;t feel like doing it&quot; is definitely a sentence I hear regularly among my peers.<p>Finally, surrounding yourself with smart, hard working people is the ultimate productivity hack to me. In college, the quality of my work changed drastically depending on whether I sat at the front of the class with the math nerds or at the back of the class with the anime nerds. I realized that while I can be self-driven when it comes to things that <i>really</i> matter to me, a lot of the time I will follow the general tendencies of whatever group I am in. I suspect this is why all the smart, talented people in the industry are friends in some capacity - because they recognize how tremendously powerful it is to be in an environment where the average is very, very high. This leads to situations where you have companies who seem to be always in the spotlight, always have the best people, etc. (i.e. Valve, Oculus, iD Software, to stay in the gaming register that the article has), and then the other 99%.<p>If you feel like your workplace isn&#x27;t encouraging you to be the best you can be on that front, that&#x27;s an extremely compelling reason to find another place.",1394286238

2528373,comment,2526099,2527472,1,0,michaelcampbell,,,"Well, I'm on the outsourcing end of the equation (although I haven't had a hand in the actual outsourcing itself), and I can say from firsthand experience the 'cheap' meme is accurate.<p>The reason given for removing existing personnel to replace them with outsourced people is twofold.  One is cost, and it is the large majority of the sum total of the reasons.  The other reason is the erroneous idea that the company can train up a bunch of outsourced people and have a flexible, dynamically sized, workforce.<p>The <i>justification</i> is that ""they're just as good"".<p>In the 10-12 or so years I have seen this tried, it has yet to even COME CLOSE to what was promised.  The reason it keeps happening is the person in charge of the decision gets his bonus for cutting the costs, then moves on, long before the actual long-medium terms costs become known.  By then that person is long gone and/or up the corporate ladder to where no one dare say ""this sucked, he's the guy that caused it"".<p>My view is cynical and jaded, but it is from experience.  And I say this not having ever lost my job over it, so that's not a factor.",1304942321

I think it correctly notices that a lot of both sides have been talking past each other lately, because the old 50s/60s oppositions aren't quite there anymore. In some ways, Chomsky's critique is obsolete, but that's in part precisely because Chomskyian ideas have now been taken up in the statistical community, in ideas like grammar induction. ML is now willing to study grammar models higher up the Chomsky hierarchy than the simple Markov-chain models they investigated in the 50s, which does owe something to Chomsky's studies in formal grammar (like the existence of the Chomsky hierarchy), even if Chomsky himself has been slow to notice that they have indeed taken up some of his ideas.",1304941357

2528280,comment,2526546,2526546,1,0,frobozz,,,"Two anecdotes in favour of using a nom de plume:<p>1) Some time ago, I decided to use my real name on the web, to build my professional presence.  I wasn't quite unique, but any results that came up for a search on my name were pretty inconsequential.  Since I made that decision, two more prominent people with the same name have come to the fore.  One of whom operates in a fairly close field to my own, and the other is a film actor.  This makes it very difficult to build a personal brand.  If you search for my real name online, you get pages and pages of the actor.  If you add a bit more context, you get the other guy first, and eventually you might find me, but you'd have to know quite a bit about us to be able to differentiate, and I know I've.  If I had a sensible nom de plume, I would not have had this problem.  Another mitigation would have been to try to build my personal brand a bit more aggressively at the start.<p>2) Before I signed up here, I started working for an organisation that requires me to explicitly dissociate my personal web activity from any activity I might undertake in the name of my employer (i.e. my opinions are my own, and do not represent...).  If I'd had the account here before then, linked to my profiles elsewhere, then I'd have to add that kind of guff to my profile here.  Personally, I think that making it unlikely that anyone would link what I say here to my employer is better than explicitly highlighting that I don't speak for my employer.",1304939568

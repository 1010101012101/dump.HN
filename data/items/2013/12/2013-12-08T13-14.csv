6869690,comment,6869142,6869142,9,0,knackernews,,,"I disagree with racism being an issue keeping blacks & latinos from open source / free software development and I don&#x27;t understand why people keep talking about barriers to software development. These days computers are ubiquitous (in the developed world at least). You can be poor but still afford a computer, and all the knowledge and tools you need are available for free. The only potential barriers I see is having the skills required to make useful contributions to an established project (something at the level of the existing developers) and free time.<p>About myself: I didn&#x27;t go to a great school; Didn&#x27;t have friends or classmates who were interested in computers or programming; Didn&#x27;t have a role model to inspire or guide me; Never went to a workshop or joined a user group; Never attended a computer science class until I was in college.<p>I got fascinated by computers by reading about them in a newspaper when I was a kid, and had to go on a hunger strike every night until my father caved in and bought one for the house. By the time I was 15 I worked together with 4 guys to build a popular website and we developed a file editor together. We collaborated over IRC and what&#x27;s interesting is that we knew nothing about each other except our nicknames and where we lived (This was before social networks became popular). Nothing else mattered except our mutual interest and skill.<p>Oh, and I&#x27;m not white.",1386511100

My history of technology professor at the University of Minnesota used to speak of the &quot;precocious technology&quot; of Medieval Europe, in which artisans often invented devices that could not be fully explained by the science of the time. Precocious technology is, of course, a worldwide phenomenon and a phenomenon from all eras (including our own). The astonishing artifact reported on here has very unclear provenance--it&#x27;s not clear how it passed into the hands of the collector from whose collection it came into the Smithsonian museums. Moreover, the lack of writing in the culture of origin at the time the artifact is thought to have been made means there is no history (written records) to supplement archaeology for inferences about the cultural role of the artifact. But it is a thought-provoking find all the same, and an example of what else might be missing from the archaeological record.",1386510456

A currency only has value because we, as a society, decide that it does. As we&#x27;ve seen, it also needs to be stable, portable and non-toxic. And it needs to be fairly rare - you might be surprised just how little gold there is in the world.<p>>The demand for gold can vary wildly - and with a fixed supply, that can lead to equally wild swings in its price. Most recently for example, the price has gone from $260 per troy ounce in 2001, to peak at $1,921.15 in September 2011, before falling back to $1,230 currently. That is hardly the behaviour of a stable store of value.<p>Basically describes what are and are not the problems with Bitcoin.",1386510177

However, I can also say that it seems things are getting much much better. Just a little under 3 years ago, I&#x27;d attend a conference with 300, 500, or even 500+ attendees, and would EASILY count the amount of black folks on a pair of hands (yes) and the ladies on 2-3 pair of hands. This isn&#x27;t necessarily the case anymore (it&#x27;s still kind of a problem though). Also, a majority of the &quot;white men&quot; programmers I know in the industry are very welcoming and helpful in this sense, so I wouldn&#x27;t blame &quot;white men&quot; since that&#x27;s just too general, and quite frankly, wrong, for the most part. Now that that&#x27;s out of the way, THERE ARE those &quot;white men&quot; who are not so welcoming and aren&#x27;t afraid to show it either. I couldn&#x27;t even tell you the amount of times I&#x27;ve been offended by such folks. There&#x27;s even one conference I went to where I was literally stopped on my way to grab lunch and randomly requested to go to security to be searched while EVERYONE ELSE was enjoying the sessions and meals. I was searched, I went to bathroom and cried for a while (yes, I admit it), and immediately headed home afterwards. Which conference ... well, I digress.

Each of these aspects add new systems of gameplay.<p>but these additional relationships don&#x27;t seem like things you can predict without presupposing the existence of the whole sentient world. And we&#x27;ve said nothing about where the sword came from in the first place!<p>I agree with you on gameplay-significant procedural generation. After playing and loving Noctis and Frontier: Elite II, I wanted to create an arty space exploration game where you took control of a mysterious alien being who roamed the universe in search of &quot;knowledge&quot;. You&#x27;d do this by exploring and scanning features of the universe with different tools that took skill to use.<p>For example, to scan a mountain range, you&#x27;d have to land several probes around it, maybe in difficult conditions. &quot;Knowledge&quot; would be things like &quot;tallest mountain range&quot;,&quot;largest ocean&quot;,&quot;oxygen atmosphere&quot;,&quot;binary system with habitable planets&quot;. I thought this was a good way of having distinct goals, but remaining open ended and unpredictable. &quot;biggest&quot;,&quot;tallest&quot; etc being things which are easy to specify but could be anywhere in the universe.<p>I thought you could fly a &quot;living ship&quot; a bit like Moia in Farscape. This ship would develop according to how much knowledge you accumulated, along with resources you extract from the universe.<p>My goal was to make the procedural world itself as something of concern for the player, to encourage the player to actually get out there into the depths. Maybe I&#x27;ll start on it someday, I don&#x27;t know. Everyone seems to be making space games at the moment!",1386509138

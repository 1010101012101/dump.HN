Services are no longer apps or on the web but part of the system. Phone numbers are obsolete, you would phone facebook contacts as you would on skype. Such a system could perhaps offer better advertising capabilities and offer another competitor against Google and Apple on the mobile landscape..",1328144390

Interactions between negative nodes can further degrade network value (e.g.: flamewars, retaliatory attacks, etc.).<p>There's a modification to Metcalfe's law which suggests that the value of additional nodes degrades with time (Odlyzko &Tilly, ""A Refutation of Metcalfe's Law"" <a href=""http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/metcalfe.ps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/metcalfe.ps</a>)<p>I'd argue that Odlyzko and Tilly are optimists.<p>And that any comments architecture which relies on Metcalfe's Law is fundamentally flawed.<p>You can either arbitrarily restrict who has access to your network (Usenet and ARPANET worked well when they were limited to defense, edu, and a handful of tech companies), or find a scalable and subversion-resistant moderation system which leverages your community to enact filtering.

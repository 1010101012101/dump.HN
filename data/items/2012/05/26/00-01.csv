Much of a professional programmer's time is spent mindlessly debugging crapware, in other words, code plumbing. Plumbing is a separate speciality for good reason. In depth plumbing courses such as those at toiletacademy should not be required of all students.<p>On the other hand, I certainly agree that everyone should be taught mathematical thinking. Nearly everybody in the first world is already taught elementary mathematics. That is certainly not something Jeff Atwood is opposing here.<p>> <i>Their world is comprised of apps and silos.</i><p>Programmer's worlds are comprised of apps and silos just as much as everyone elses. Indeed, everyone who is a victim of the UNIX pestilence lives in a world of incompatible competing applications.<p>> <i>They don't realise that their e-reader is a general purpose computing device capable of more than just downloading books from that one store they bought it from.</i><p>That is because most modern e-readers are deliberately designed to be that way.

4026021,story,,,1,0,need2ask,"Ask HN: Do tech companies care a lot about criminal history?",,"I'm worried sick that a great job offer I got will be rescinded because of my background. Yes, this is a throwaway account because I know people from the company read HN a lot and I want to protect myself for now. So here's the deal:<p>I was once arrested, charged, and had the case nolle prossed (case was thrown out) close to five years ago and I just got through the interview process at a tech company that hired me as a front-end developer/SEO guy. I got offered and accepted the job but the forms I signed said that they can rescind that offer or terminate me at any time if my background check comes back unsuccessful. I start in just over a week and I'm terrified that they'll rescind the offer once the results come back.<p>I've been 100% honest with them about everything on my resume and the application with one little caveat: I was told that since my case was nolle prossed that I can answer no to questions about being convicted and pleaing guilty. I did so on the original application but the wording is such that it implies you have to tell whether you ever plead guilty OR were convicted. I plead guilty to get the case thrown out and I answered no to that question truly believing it was okay because of what the court told me.<p>The charge itself is a felony forgery charge. I'm young (20's) and was doing odd jobs one summer and got paid in cash by a shady guy. Turns out some of that cash was fake. I stupidly tried to use it knowingly, got away with it initially, then was tracked down, arrested, and charged later. I paid the money back plus a fine, plead guilty and got the case thrown out. To me, it was a dumb mistake (my only big mistake) that doesn't even come close to representing me as a person.<p>So now I'm wondering if I should say something before I begin my first day or if I should just let it ride and see if they say something. Its stressing me out to no end and I don't know what to do and I'm so scared that once they find out they'll take the job back. I got in based on my skill, experience, and personality and it's just so terrible that a mistake like this that looks so bad on paper but is really not as bad in context can haunt me forever. Any insight is appreciated.",1337993637

4025968,comment,4023478,4025355,3,0,adiM,,,"Please verify your facts before bashing TeX.<p>Firstly, tab completion does not need those binaries. Zsh does similar tab completion for git (which uses 150 binaries) and hg (which uses one binary).<p>Now for TeX, pdfTeX has been around since, well, since the mid 90s. It has been part of the standard TeX distribution for more than 10 years. So for the last 10-15 years, TeX can directly produce PDF.<p>Similarly, xetex has been around since 2003-04 and luatex since 2007-08. With both of them, using OTF and TTF fonts is as simple as just saying `\setmainfont[Dejavu]` (using the simplefont module in ConTeXt or fontspec package in LaTeX).  No need for converting to TFM files or anything.<p>The reason TeX is built like TeX is because when it started, postscript/pdf did not exist, Type1/TrueType/OpenType fonts did not exist, so TeX had to create its own formats. Over the years TeX has adapted to the new technology: you can easily use UTF-8 input (for text and math), ttf/otf fonts, opentype math fonts, use Lua to write macros, and get PDF output. You are objecting to the fact that TeX works hard to be backward compatible and carries  around all the legacy programs so that documents written in 90s still compile easily today.  If you don't want them, just don't install them (again this is more of a packing issue than anything else).",1337992257

Since the client has complete control over the javascript, it seems like it would be possible to simply send the server fake acknowledgement that the user has completed the game successfully. This seems fundamentally flawed and differs from regular captcha, where the client side has no awareness of right and wrong answers, and can't give immediate feedback. It simply acts an input to the server, which then judges the correctness, and if it isn't correct, returns a <i>different</i> problem, so a bot would have to start all over again.<p>So I think beating this captcha wouldn't require computer vision and stuff, simply sniffing the traffic on a successful run of the game and then replicating it appropriately later.<p>Also, how will this captcha system scale? They'll have to keep coming up with new sets of objects where some of them belong on a target and some don't.",1337992210

I don't see how exceptions help make lazy programmers perform due diligence.<p>That being said, there is a place for exceptions. Truly exceptional conditions such as index out of bounds, or nil pointer dereference, or some internal precondition violated, should be treated in an exceptional manner. Go does this with panics, and panics are almost never caught as part of control-flow. They tend to be caught at the root of goroutines, logged, and the goroutine killed. The HTTP library, for instance, will catch panics in any goroutine it spawns, and write a 503.<p>I just find it odd that people treat commonplace things as exceptional. File open failed?

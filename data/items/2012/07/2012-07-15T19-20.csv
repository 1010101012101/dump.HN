A great example is TP-Link's TL-WR703N which is as little as $24USD.<p>It has very little RAM and memory, but OpenWRT is an excellent, stable and simple Linux distribution for making internet connected devices and interfacing with other hardware as well through a USB port. It also allows for easy scripting with Lua and beyond that, Lua can also be used with LuCI to create MVC web applications inside these tiny computers, with Wifi built in!",1342382246

I'm about a week into the process of incorporating a company and trying to figure out how in the hell I'm going to do this.<p>While not particularly novel advice, the one thing I can advise (and I have to remind myself of this constantly) is to be cognizant of whether your spending too much time focusing on the inconsequential things (which seem psychically easier to deal with) than the important things.<p>In my case, I'm still trying to figure out a plan for getting initial work (which you might imagine is a pretty important thing), but I found myself debating for days about my new logo (which is pretty much guaranteed to never be looked at by anyone for longer than a few seconds at the top of my web page).<p>I've also spent hours figuring out systems for how I'm going to handle  invoicing, client management, output delivery, branding and marketing, etc.<p>All of those things are certainly important to do, but I find it's way too easy for me to focus my energy on them, instead of the elephant in the room.<p>Good luck though.",1342382240
4247894,comment,4247367,4247367,1,0,jiggy2011,,,"At the crux of this issue is the question about correlation of intelligence and ambition with wealth. I would be surprised if there was no correlation at all, on the other hand it would be interesting to see what the relationship really is but I can't think of an experiment that could be done in a way which would be both accurate and ethical (for example switching poor and rich children at birth).<p>This seems to be one of the arguments around keeping taxes low for the rich (or ""job creators"") the implicit assumption seems to be ""rich people are smart, therefor they should be put in charge of money distribution"".<p>As an example, there was somebody I grew up with who is now running a ~$1 million turnover web design company at 27.
He is sometimes invited to speak at events as a successful entrepreneur and demonstrated as an example of how hard work can pay off etc.<p>Unfortunately if you know the real story it is somewhat less impressive. He graduated from university with a fairly average degree and was having trouble finding employment at any job that he was interested in working at. He comes from a wealthy background however, so had little time constraints on his job search. After some time he decided to give up looking for work and establish himself as a freelance designer, his family gave him a chunk of money with which to establish himself.<p>For the first few years his business was not too successful and was draining capital, he was having difficulty finding clients as his portfolio of work was not really comparable to other established companies who were charging similar rates.<p>After a few years his family sold one of the businesses they owned which freed up a bunch of extra capital, a chunk of this they gave to him. He was able to use this money to hire some talented designers who did excellent work and won him a bunch of awards and bigger contracts, this was really the catalyst that made him successful.<p>Of course if the guy was a complete idiot he would have squandered even that opportunity, he was intelligent enough to run a business day-to-day but there was no way he would have managed that without such a capital injection. Would be interesting to think about how many people in his position would have failed and how many would have been successful earlier.",1342382221

They were noticeably more contactful.<p>On the west coast, things don't work that way. People seem nicer on the surface but it's a cool sunniness.

4247836,comment,4247488,4247488,31,0,Timothee,,,"It's definitely challenging.<p>One part is actually meeting people with whom you click. Unless you go to a lot of meetups and similar events, overall, you won't be meeting that many new people besides co-workers. And meetups tend to have a theme other than just having fun, whereas that's what most college activities are about. So you meet people in a serious context, and you need to bring the fun with you.*<p>So, you first need to come across someone with whom you click, and then you have to fuel that relationship. What's difficult there is that you need time. Once married with children, grabbing a beer after work is not as simple. You also have that awkwardness as pictured in ""I love you, man"" (and I believe a Louis CK sketch in his TV show): you have to acknowledge pretty fast that there's something going on and that you feel you could indeed become friends! It's <i>one</i> meetup, you're awkward now with that guy who seems cool, or you might never see him again.<p>But as you grow older, you also lose a lot of that casualness that you had before: you don't just invite them over after work to play video games. Now that you're a ""grown-up"", it's ""a dinner"". And since you're a grown-up, your home has better be somewhat clean, and you can't just serve pizza. What was a spontaneous interaction before is now a whole event that needs planning, some cleaning, some cooking, etc. (until of course, you become real friends) So these happen less, and friendships can be like making mayonnaise: if you don't make it go right now, you'll never make it go at all.<p>* I'm not saying meetups are no fun, just that it's not the end-game for everyone. Some people are there only for ""professional"" reasons and you need to figure out what people are looking for.",1342381006

4247714,comment,4245737,4246676,3,0,slurgfest,,,"In most of your statically-typed OOP languages, a type declaration really is just an assertion like ""the value bound to 'foo' is always a number"".  This falls far short of asserting that it has the intended properties. For example, ""is a number"" is miles away from ""is the largest prime number less than  n.""<p>For most interesting programs, it is simply not enough to have something which is a number. So you must use some supplementary mechanism to verify all the interesting properties. In practice the supplementary mechanism is not as awkward as writing extended type theory proofs in your programs. Now if this supplementary mechanism is good enough to depend on for all the interesting correctness checks, why isn't it good enough for the basic stuff as well?<p>If you do make the type system expressive enough to verify everything, it is Turing complete, and many assertions are only verified by calculating them in the type system. But if you write a correct implementation in your Turing-complete type system, it is at least as easy to write a correct implementation in the ordinary way. So why not just write the same code twice, and raise an exception if a result does not get a quorum?<p>This might be a valid strategy for some cases. But in most cases, some kinds of errors are just much more important to cover than others.<p>Static vs. dynamic typing is not the issue. The first issue is what kind of system you have for annotating code with appropriate assertions - easier is better, assuming that more assertions are always better.<p>The second issue is how much of this annotation is mandatory. Push it to the limit and you get a ""bondage and discipline"" language. Pair it with a type system that is less than extraordinary and you spend a significant share of your time wrestling an awkward type system.<p>Some people seem to enjoy this activity. But unless you do most of your coding under the influence of heavy sedatives, the odds are that the majority of your errors are not simply passing the wrong primitive type. And unless something is really wrong with you, most of your errors are not due to your inability to put an unbreakable padlock on your own code to limit your own intentional malice. So it is certainly possible to emphasize these cases.<p>But that should be based on some understanding of costs. If a given class of error is infrequent and low-cost, there should be a burden to justify spending 50% more time always handling that class of error.<p>If the language understands those costs better than the human then that could be helpful (particularly applicable to DSLs). But if it does not then it is better for the human to be able to manage this for themselves.<p>The real argument seems to be about which classes of assertions should be mandatory, not anything about the internal type accounting. Seems to me that this should be a decision specific to the purpose. If you are teaching programming your requirements might be different from if you are writing missile guidance systems. Moreover, different people might have different tastes!<p>So I am getting pretty tired of the facile suggestion that static typing (in particular, as implemented in mainstream blub languages) is invariably safer and that this makes it an obvious choice. The only variable at hand is NOT how much you care about maintaining invariants. It is really not that simple. It is also very significant what kinds of invariants you mean to maintain and what amount of cost you are willing to absorb to maintain them.",1342378867

I personally find it hard to reconcile OO with functional though (as in side effect free functional). I guess my personal (probably incorrect) experience with OO is all about mutability and state machines, whereas that is totally at odds with the rest of scala. So I end up not knowing what to do with the OO bit. I do like OO though, but I just can't seem to get it to fit together in my mind.",1208995176

Also, I recommend you visit the book store and flip through a few design books with focus on identity systems...<p>It's also rather naive to assume someone is going to remember your name, phone number, company name, and email address because ""you're special"" and have the next billion dollar IP.<p>Lastly, how else are you suppose to get free lunch?! cmon, join teh party!",1208994884

172025,comment,171731,171911,0,0,jrockway,,,"> Let's get right to the core of the problem: prototypical based inheritance is worse than class based inheritance. It's nothing like what all other languages are using, it's a pain to use and it's less powerful. That's the only language feature that is wildly inconsistent from other popular languages.<p>Fortunately, it's easy to build a real object system on top of Javascript's ""default"":<p><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/joose-js/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/joose-js/</a><p>Perl is the same way.  The default object system is garbage, but when you put Moose on it, it's the best of any language.  (CLOS is a very close second, but it needs roles/traits!)",1208994251

But what you get ""out of the archive"" is a bog-standard customer pays $x/mo for access to the app which has some limits based on the value of x, and the limits are up to you to implement (aside from the included one, which limits the number of users that can be associated with a customer's account).",1208993130

Sometimes a little piece of paper pre-printed is easier than finding a pen and paper or expecting someone to have a blackberry/iphone on hand.  Plus, they're cheap.  Not having a business card means throwing away offline word of mouth opportunities.  To me, I want to see <i>smart</i> people focused on making a great product.

Using something like the Prototype library helps -- it adds power for metaprogramming as well as for more practical things like DOM and event manipulation.<p>Once you figure out OO idioms you like using, the main limitations are random annoyances like the lack of a clean idiom for linked lists and the fact that the JS spec doesn't require tail call optimization, so some functional idioms are going to be dog-slow.",1208992768

You can emulate class-based inheritance, but you can also use a variety of other models, such as adding in only a single specified method from another class or adding in capabilities on a per-object basis instead of per-class.<p>Yes it's different, and maybe it's a pain to use -- especially if what you want is for it to be language x (for some value of x) -- but I don't understand how you can justify the claim that it's less powerful.",1208992391

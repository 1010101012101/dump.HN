7070582,comment,7070225,7070225,4,0,badman_ting,,,"Different frameworks can have very different approaches to doing similar things. I started writing Javascript in a place that used Prototype, a library which is now either defunct or just unused, but anyway its approach (and purpose) were rather different from jQuery. For instance, Prototype relies heavily on altering the built-in types, which today we consider a no-no.<p>I&#x27;m talking about this because I think it&#x27;s interesting that people are moving from starting with jQuery to attempting not to use any framework at all. I&#x27;m in favor of that because it&#x27;s best to know what you&#x27;re working with before you start adding on, you taste the soup before you add salt.<p>But personally I wouldn&#x27;t want to work on any kind of real project without something to handle a lot of the more tedious aspects of JS development. Of course there are always polyfills and &quot;micro libraries&quot; but at some point you are replicating some of the professed downsides of using a framework, or to put it differently, how many micro libraries equal a framework?<p>Another company recently posted about eschewing JS frameworks, followed by a lively HN discussion, only to announce their in-house &quot;library&quot; that does many of the same things we need frameworks for. IT seems like there&#x27;s a circle here where a lot of people go from all jQuery -> questioning jQuery as a crutch to &quot;real js development&quot; -> realizing all the things that jQuery or similar handle for us -> resignation and acceptance.<p>So it may ultimately be more useful to compare the approach of different libraries or frameworks to see what we can glean from them in how we write our own JS, what works and what doesn&#x27;t. Not to mention, there are things that jQuery just does not have, that would be super useful and show up in other frameworks, so those things just don&#x27;t show up on people&#x27;s radar if jQuery is the only framework they&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m talking about <i>anything at all</i> for dealing with cookies. (Cookies, for god&#x27;s sake! Not exactly an esoteric corner of web development!) I&#x27;m talking about turning a query string into an object and vice versa. Imagine you need to take a URL, modify one value in the query string, and write it back out. How do you do it?<p>Anyway, yes, definitely learn about document.querySelectorAll.

The tracks became cheesier and cheesier, and a lot of the old vibe was gone.<p>They turned to Garage, Grime and Breaks and found a fertile playing ground in the fledgling Dubstep scene. Lo&#x27; and behold, there it was, the fat dubby bass of their youth.<p>Alas, again, an 18-year old teenager today has a very different picture of &quot;Dubstep&quot; compared to that of the people who originated the sound. No more dub, a lot of cheese. Somewhat similar to the entire drum and bass story. The genre has been appropriated by the masses.<p>And well, the circle goes on and on. The same thing applies to older genres such as &quot;Electro&quot;, which in the 80&#x27;s meant something entirely different from what it is now.<p>So in a sense, how useful are genres really?",1389890878

The companies make it easy to do so -- I have a friend at a large electronics company who said they took care of housing, relocation, even a company hospital (&quot;hospital&quot; was the term he used, although I suppose it could have been a clinic).<p>- Entrepreneurs are seen as somehow tricky or ethically lacking. This was expressed to me by middle-aged salarymen at giant multinationals a few years ago, so I don&#x27;t know if the attitude has changed.<p>- Large companies have extensive and deep supplier relationships that discourage taking a chance on an upstart.<p>I&#x27;d like to hear the observations of other HNers who are Japanese or have long experience in the country.",1389890829

I have about half a dozen projects that could use this.<p>A question to no company in particular, though this seems to be a good place to ask.<p>Why are you not taking backorders?  I have noticed, across multiple startups and other electronics companies, that the pattern seems to be:<p>1) Produce $QUANTITY items in the first production run\n2) Sell out in $RIDICULOUSLY_SHORT_TIME\n3) Order $QUANTITY * $MULTIPLE while telling potential customers, &quot;We ordered more from the manufacturer, check back later!&quot;<p>The last step turns getting an item into a sort of lottery.  If you take backorders, though, you get a defined backlog to work through.  Your customers will definitely get what they want (eventually).  Plus, you know what $MULTIPLE should be going forward because you have a defined set of work for the future.  I spent the first four years of my career as an EE with an aerospace company, and for us having a backlog was a good thing (as long as we could meet our contractual obligations, of course).

Along with debug tracing messages like this below, they&#x27;re logging server interactions and JSON responses that contain personal information (I see my home address, telephone number, etc coming back from the server and being logged).<p><pre><code>   2539 $ -[CardDetailViewController refreshCardDetails:] line 798 $ \n   2548 $ -[CardDetailImageViewController viewDidLoad] line 28 $ view did load\n   2551 $ -[CardDetailImageViewController viewWillAppear:] line 48 $ view will appear\n   2551 $ -[CardDetailImageViewController viewDidAppear:] line 53 $ view did appear\n   2588 $ -[CardDetailViewController refreshCardDetails:] line 798 $ \n   2607 $ -[CardDetailViewController doPageChange:] line 684 $ :\n   2652 $ -[CardDetailViewController viewDidAppear:] line 301 $ I APPEARED!!\n   2652 $ -[StarbucksAppDelegate trackView:] line 1084 $ 2014-01-14 18:50:37 +0000 /Card/MyCard\n   2791 $ -[CardDetailViewController viewDidAppear:] line 301 $ I APPEARED!!\n</code></pre>\nSo the situation here isn&#x27;t one of tokens vs passwords vs encryption or otherwise how they&#x27;re being stored for interacting with the server.  The user is going to have to enter a password at some point in the workflow, regardless of whether it&#x27;s encrypted at rest or exchanged for an OAuth token or whatever. You shouldn&#x27;t be logging that password back to the console when the user enters it!<p>edit: This also means that all that personal information of mine is presumably on some Crashlytics host as a side effect of all this having been logged and sucked up by Crashlytics.",1389890604

The issue isn&#x27;t &quot;houses, papers, and effects&quot; not encompassing e-mail, but the &quot;belonging to that person&quot; aspect. Phone metadata doesn&#x27;t &quot;belong&quot; to you. It belongs to your phone company. They generated it, they store it--you never even see it. It&#x27;s also quite questionable how much of say your Facebook data &quot;belongs&quot; to you. Or your GPS location data. It&#x27;s <i>about</i> you, but much or all of it is generated by some company and stored by that company, and you are often even not aware of it nor do you have access to it. You have little to no recourse if they lose it, destroy it, or misuse it. You can&#x27;t even make them let you see it.<p>Indeed, I strongly agree with your use of the word &quot;belong&quot; because I think the use of &quot;houses&quot; and &quot;persons&quot; purposefully puts the 4th amendment on a strong property rights foundation.[1] But viewing the 4th amendment through the lens of property rights (i.e. &quot;everything I can think of belonging to that person&quot;) makes most of what the NSA is doing quite legal! Things that are <i>about you</i> do not necessarily <i>belong to you</i>. If I write down every time my neighbor enters and leaves his house, that&#x27;s mine, not his. Is Facebook tracks what you click on and your cellular company tracks your GPS location or your phone company tracks who you call, that&#x27;s their data, not yours.<p>[1] The prevailing Supreme Court view of the 4th amendment is broader than this property rights view, but still embraces third party doctrine which makes much of what the NSA is doing legal. And certain Justices seem partial to the property rights formulation.",1389890602

Starbucks&#x27; server has the private key, the iPhone app \n     has the public key.\n\n  2. The app locks the plaintext up in AES with the public \n     key, local to the phone, and keeps the locked data, \n     and sends a copy to the server. The server has the \n     private key, and can unlock the data locked up with \n     the public key anytime, even though the app (in \n     possession of the public key only) cannot unlock the \n     data by itself.\n\n  3. The app needs network access to operate properly, \n     because honestly, why is Starbucks attempting to \n     transact without a network connection, so if there&#x27;s \n     no network access and the protected data can&#x27;t be \n     accessed, oh well. Oh, and by the way, if the app \n     really needs the plaintext, why not just ask the user? \n     Oh right, thinking is hard. Don&#x27;t ask a lazy user to \n     do anything.\n\n  4. Each time the app needs to unlock the protected data \n     and use it locally, it sends a GET request to the \n     server via HTTPS. Maybe it sends XML, maybe it sends \n     JSON. Who cares, as long as it&#x27;s not keeping and using \n     the plaintext.\n\n  5. Based on the nature of the request, the server decides \n     whether it needs to send the plain text back over \n     HTTPS, or whether the app is just asking the server to \n     do something server-side involving sensitive data. If \n     the app *REALLY* needs the locked data sent back in \n     plaintext, the server sends it back for one time use \n     via HTTPS (still protected from interception, even \n     though it&#x27;s being sent over network), to be nulled out \n     after the process or function returns complete.\n\n  6. The server is a fortress, and has the private key \n     (...somewhere). It does not store the sensitive data \n     in plain text. It too only stores the locked data, but \n     is capable of unlocking the data on the fly, per \n     request, each request, every time. The server should \n     actively garbage collect the plaintext data, and not \n     leave stale copies lying around.\n\n  7. The server *NEVER* give an app a copy of the private \n     key. NEVER, EVER. The iPhone app can rot in hell if it \n     can&#x27;t get the data unlocked. If it has to wait, it \n     waits. Find something else to do. Mine bitcoins, \n     unfold some proteins, whatever.\n</code></pre>\nYes. This demands a server infrastructure with high performance and high availability, according to the popularity of the app (many millions of concurrent users). It will be expensive and complicated to execute something like this. One would not <i>JUST</i> AES it.<p>But hey, lazy users can&#x27;t be bothered to type passwords and such. Gee whiz!

But that&#x27;s because it isn&#x27;t science at all. It is a religious belief, which is by definition non-scientific.<p>Here is where the science side gets things wrong. Creationism is a NON-scientific belief, not an ANTI-scientific belief. It&#x27;s not anti-intellectual or stupid or backward either. It&#x27;s a choice to believe in the supernatural. Lots of people, even non-religious people, believe things on grounds other than science. Science is an excellent way of explaining the world, but it isn&#x27;t the only way. People have the right to inform their beliefs with a source other than science.<p>Here is where the creationism side gets things wrong. Same basic principle, creationism is not a scientific belief. Christians, even those who accept evolution, believe a lot of things which are clearly not scientifically sound. Bodily resurrection from the dead is perhaps the most obvious and most fundamental. It&#x27;s absurd to accept the resurrection of a deity without seeking scientific evidence and then try to make scientific evidence support creationism. Even if you convince someone that creationism is scientific, you aren&#x27;t going to convince them that a deity being bodily resurrected from the dead is scientific. Given that Jesus&#x27; resurrection is the fundamental belief of Christianity, it&#x27;s silly to make such a big deal of something that is comparatively non-important.<p>So my suggestion, teach evolution in science class without mentioning creationism at all. But require at least one class in religion/philosophy so students understand that there are other ways of understanding the world. I&#x27;m not saying to teach the beliefs of any particular religion, just to explain some of the ways other than science that people have historically and continue today to understand their world.<p>The overwhelming majority of people on Earth today are at least nominally religious. Schools shouldn&#x27;t teach students to <i>be</i> religious, but they should teach them to understand religion... and not just as a cute, prehistoric way of explaining things that science now has exclusive domain over. Religious beliefs, as non-scientific beliefs, are non-falsifiable. Students need to understand this. Modern science does not falsify religious beliefs. It provides an alternative based on empirical evidence. But there is no requirement that everyone on Earth only accept things based on empirical evidence. It may seem odd to you to deliberately choose to believe something which isn&#x27;t based on empirical evidence, but many people do (knowingly at that) and that is their right. Students should understand that science is not a tool for disproving religion, it is a tool for explaining the world in a different way than religion does.",1389889903

Now, consider all complex numbers of the form<p><pre><code>    a_0 + a_1 * s + a_2 * s^2 + ... + a_(p-1) s^(p-1)\n</code></pre>\nwhere the a&#x27;s (a_0,a_1,...,a_(p-1)) are integers. Note that the fact that s^p == 1 means that we can multiply two things of this form and end up with another thing of this form. Likewise, we can add two things of this form, and get another thing of this form.* For the sake of notation, let&#x27;s call the set of all such complex numbers Z[s] (where &quot;Z&quot; denotes the set of integers).<p>In 1847, the French mathematician Gabriel Lamé[1] published an attempted proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem (ie the assertion that there are no positive integer solutions of x^n + y^n = z^n for n > 2) that carried the implicit assumption that every element of Z[s] except 0, 1, and -1 break down uniquely into irreducibles (much like factoring positive integers: 12 = 2 * 2 * 3, and that&#x27;s the only way to break 12 down into primes (up to reordering)).<p>However, this uniqueness of factorization doesn&#x27;t hold when p=23, as discovered by the German mathematician Ernst Kummer[2]. The failure of this approach to proving FLT resulted in the discovery of a significant amount of Algebraic Number Theory, in an attempt to &quot;build more machinery&quot; to get around the problems posed by Lamé&#x27;s proof. Eventually, Andrew Wiles found a proof of FLT in 1995 that relied on Elliptic Curves and Modular Forms (two fields of mathematics of which I know pretty much nothing).<p>Another, less long-winded example is the Bridges of Königsberg[3]. In 1736, the following problem was posed to Leonhard Euler: is it possible to take a tour of the city of Königsberg in such a way that each bridge is crossed exactly once and you end in the same place where you start?<p>It turns out that the answer to that question is &quot;No&quot;, and in his approach to answering the question, Euler laid the foundation for Graph Theory. Also, the roots of Topology can be tied back to this problem, as well.<p>* - In particular, the set of such complex numbers form what&#x27;s called a ring (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring</a>).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Lam%C3%A9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Lam%C3%A9</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Kummer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Kummer</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler#Graph_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler#Graph_theory</a>",1389889331

The theory of evolution gets so expansive when you consider billions of years that it&#x27;s easier to believe in intelligent design.<p>In a clever twist, many creationists have started claiming that they accept micro-evolution (e.g. the idea that bird beaks would change over generations like Darwin observed) while denying that macro-evolution happens.

(I&#x27;ve also shared the link among my Facebook friends, so that they can help me digest this.) On the whole, I like the author&#x27;s take that charter schools are a good idea, a good enough idea that while Texas limits the number of charter schools to 300 statewide, it is important to make sure that each charter school offers a sound curriculum. And I think the author is correct that the Responsive Ed charter school curriculum is simply unsound both as to science and as to history.<p>Regulation of schools is the job of state governments in the United States by default. Political forces in the state legislature in Texas make it hard to fix this problem solely by state legislation, because the Responsive Ed curriculum does represent the point of view of some highly motivated and politically active Texas voters. The article author points out that federal constitutional principles ban teaching religious doctrine in the guise of teaching school curriculum content, so that is one possible response to the skewed curriculum in these charter schools. Another, too little considered in most articles about school choice in general, is simply for other schools to boldly proclaim that their curriculum is better, and explain why it is better. The Responsive Ed schools surely find agreement among some parents shopping for schools in Texas, but they would also be embarrassed to have to defend point by point all of the ridiculous things they say in their curriculum. In particular, it would be good for other schools to specifically mention the many lines of evidence for macroevolution[1] as they promote their curriculums. Comparative advertising is still an under-used tool for promoting school reform, even in states like mine with pervasive public school open enrollment.<p>I think John Stuart Mill got the policy balance correct more than a century ago, when school attendance was not compulsory in Britain nor in most parts of the United States: &quot;A general State education is a mere contrivance for moulding people to be exactly like one another: and as the mould in which it casts them is that which pleases the predominant power in the government, whether this be a monarch, a priesthood, an aristocracy, or the majority of the existing generation in proportion as it is efficient and successful, it establishes a despotism over the mind, leading by a natural tendency to one over the body.&quot;<p>John Stuart Mill <i>On Liberty</i> (1859)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/</a>",1389888355

It&#x27;s not a house, and it wasn&#x27;t built with hand tools.<p>These buildings are vast. Every $1 per square foot of renovation is a lot of money. It is further complicated because the historic features tend to include long since discontinued manufactured items. Often these components were custom designed because the products were cutting edge, needed in large quantities, and the client&#x27;s were such as to see the benefit and to afford them [e.g. Pyrex tubes at Wright&#x27;s Johnson Building and the ceiling tiles in Bunshaft&#x27;s Cigna Hedquarters].<p>Finally preservation is tough because these buildings were designed at a time when energy was cheap. Van der Rohe&#x27; Segram Building ran all the lights all night for architectural effect. All that glass which allows daylight in also creates a greenhouse. Technology can mitigate some of the effect but until we get a thermostat on the sun, the physics will remain the same.<p>Developers come in all stripes.

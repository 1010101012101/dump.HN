However, I doubt that the executives will reduce their own pay, and boards have often been in management's pocket on this issue.",1261748036

1014988,comment,1014362,1014932,0,0,stse,,,"Expressen recently listed the ""top"" tax-payers in Sweden [1]. What's interesting is that the second wealthiest person in Sweden after Kamprad, H&M owner Stefan Perssson, tops the list and pays more tax than the ten following people combined. It's also interesting to find one of the investors in Skype at #4 and one of the founders of MySQL at #11.<p><a href=""http://www.expressen.se/ekonomi/1.1797308/h-m-miljardar-betalar-mest-i-skatt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.expressen.se/ekonomi/1.1797308/h-m-miljardar-beta...</a>",1261746849

It has a nice contrast with the orange 'Y' logo.<p>However, the 'Hacker News new | threads ...' text <i>really</i> needs to be white for this new background, black doesn't have enough contrast. As a bonus, white text here will jive with the white Y better.",1261746847

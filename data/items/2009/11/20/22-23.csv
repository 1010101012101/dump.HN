I think the major problem is that the app doesn't <i>feel</i> as smooth as drop7, etc.  The winning games have a tremendous sense of <i>style</i>.  With a few relatively minor changes, I think the game would be a lot more attractive.<p>1) Get a more pleasing set of sounds.  The high-pitched screeching you are going with currently when blocks blow up is torture for me.  I like the sound when you die, however.<p>2) Make a game-mode for the beginner where it is easy to figure out the game mechanic.  I died within a few rounds each time I tried.  (Start with all little red block or whatever...)  Make this auto-start the first time the game is opened.<p>3) Moves are too clunky.  The blocks move to the side of the screen too slowly after the user presses a button.  I would make this 3-4 times faster, or just eliminate it.  Blocks also maybe fall a bit too slowly-- I would eliminate the pause before they fall.<p>4) There is too much visual clutter on the screen.  Its nice of you to show the time and battery life on top, but this clashes with your application.

To the credit of RealClimate they seem to be acknowledging the need for greater transparency that would allay some of the allegations of collusion.<p>What is a bit troubling though is RealClimate could be interpreted as defending the status quo and the monopoly on data in their response to comments.  They seem to suggest we should simply accept the studies if they are peer reviewed.  They create something of a straw man in saying that there is no evidence of a global conspiracy (I'm really not sure how many serious people think that one really exists nor is it necessary to believe that there is one in order to question the data and the policy responses being crafted).<p>They also don't address the allegation of whether some of these scientists have started with the conclusions and searched for data to show that it exists - particularly given some of the substance in some of these emails.

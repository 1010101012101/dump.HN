1016955,comment,1016462,1016768,0,0,jakozaur,,,"In CUDA kernel to PTX compilation is performed when the project is build. In OpenCL it is performed at runtime. That is ""initialization overhead"" which cause result to be different. You could use cache to avoid it.<p>So the reason of the performance differences is caused by the OpenCL's design. In OpenCL it is unknown on which hardware the kernel will run, so the compilation is postpone to runtime. I could hardly see any reason why NVIDIA would want to make OpenCL slower.<p>There are two major differences between CUDA and OpenCL:
-OpenCL is industry standard while CUDA is NVIDIA's platform
-OpenCL is a regular C library, CUDA in addition to that is extension to C language<p>CUDA kernel code will be much nicer, it will takes less lines and looks much better. The cost is it requires a special compiler (nvcc).<p>Example CUDA code: (run a kernel)

I do notice the difference between my 22-pound utility bike and 18-pound racing bike, though.  Not because of the weight, but because of the very different geometry.

But it's not their weight, it's the very tight geometry that would be unsuitable for a touring bike.)",1261912698

""Belittle the holocaust""; well if that isn't a sentence to garner a sympathetic audience I don't know what is....<p>I read the sentence not as an assertion that Russia suffers the same atrocities as those of the Stalinist era - but rather as a statement about how people in power still have not learned all of the lessons and still commit acts of crime and violence against others.<p>The conditions described (if accurate) are certainly pretty severe and the level of corruption (again, if accurate) awful - only one section of Government seems to have replied seriously to any of the accusations.<p>So, no, it is not Stalinism and not the Gulag; but the strong similarities are there.

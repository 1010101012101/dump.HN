A ""fad"" that lasted for 12 years now, since the introduction of OS X with ever-increasing Mac/OS X/Apple sales. Are you kidding me?<p>Have you ever been to a conference for geeks/hackers/programmers? Most of the laptops you'll see are Macs. Go to Python, Ruby, Rails, Mongo, MySQL, Node.js and whatever conferences -- hey, even in Java conferences, despite Apple not caring about the language at all. You can also try visiting a university such as Stanford and see which are the most popular laptops there. Most people on Hacker News use a Mac too (according to a recent HN poll I saw).<p>You seriously believe that all those highly technical and capable people are victims of a 10-12 year old ""fad""?<p>Btw, even Linus Torwalds (which doesn't like OS X's os tech) admitted that he wrote his autobiography on an iBook, running OS X and using Word. (Torwalds also used an Apple G5 as his desktop machine for a while, though he run Linux on it).",1327460379

The goal is not mastery, but to become reasonably adept. I realize this is a long process, but hopefully learning some best practices will expedite the learning process.<p>I know a lot of this is online, but its nice to have a variance in learning mediums.<p>Below are some details on my current skill level, what Im looking for, and what I can offer. Im located in the bay area.<p>Current skill level:\nI know the basics of HTML/CSS. I guess you could say I have the skills of a novice programmer, mainly in Python [+ Django], Scheme, and minimally in JavaScript, Ruby.<p>In exchange, I could teach you any amount of the following [if finance doesn't interest you, we could see if there is still a mutual value-add]:<p>- Account Fundamentals (understanding the 3 financial statements and how they flow together; balance sheet, cash flows and income statement)<p>- Interest theory, fixed income/debt/bond valuation<p>- M&A analysis and Valuation (Discounted cash flow, comparables/multiples, accretion/dilution)<p>- Options/Futures fundamentals<p>- Bankruptcy/distressed corporate situations<p>- Crash course on how to dig through and interpret SEC filings (the only reliable free primary data source if you want to invest in public markets)<p>Why would you need these skills? I think they are crucial if you are:<p>1) An entrepreneur who will ever raise capital or sell your company<p>2) Someone interested in learning how to invest in the public or private markets  this knowledge will serve as a solid foundation/prerequisite<p>3) Someone in optimizing the financial efficiency of their business<p>Id like to think I am at least acceptably good at teaching.

3508159,comment,3506293,3506293,5,0,chimeracoder,,,"This post should really be titled 'How Not To Create a To-Do List'<p>I'm a firm believer in the GTD (Getting Things Done) school of thought, which addresses many, if not all, of these concerns .<p>Paradox of choice: You should never have a choice of when to do items. Instead, pick a time every day/week to organize your to-do list and figure out when things should be done, and in what order. This should be <i>separate</i> from the time that you're doing tasks. So when you reference your to-do list, the choice is always simple: 'Can I do the next item on the list <i>right now</i> or not?'. (In practice you bend this rule slightly - but only by a little bit... a lot less than most people think).<p>Heterogeneous complexity: See above. Also, write down time estimates for each task and time yourself.<p>Heterogenous Priority: To-do list items <i>should</i> be on your calendar. A calendar is a to-do list, and a to-do list is a calendar. If your two are separate, you'r doing it wrong (according to GTD). And if it's on your to-do list, it should be done today or not at all. If you didn't get to it, before immediately bumping it to tomorrow, ask yourself whether it really needs to be done, and whether it actually fits with your long-term goals.<p>Lack of context: GTD specifically recommends partitioning tasks by context.<p>Lack of commitment devices: Having the list pre-sorted (ie, sorted at a time separate from when you're actually 'doing work') addresses this somewhat. It's not a cure-all, but honestly, if you're having trouble committing yourself to do the tasks as you prioritized them last night, I can't see how you'd be any better off with <i>no</i> structured list guiding you.<p>As for that last element: Yes, you <i>do</i> need to learn how to say 'no', but if you say 'no' based on a careful, logical evaluation of your to-do list at a time when you're not doing work, you'll be making a much wiser judgement than if you say 'no' because you're feeling overwhelmed by all the things that you're keeping in your head.",1327459870
3508158,comment,3507024,3508086,5,0,jrockway,,,"My reading of the privacy policy is that Google isn't asking for any new rights here, they're just being explicit about what they plan to do with data they collect from you.  For some people, the explicit enumeration will make them say, ""whoa, time to get out of here!""  And that's what Google wants; they don't want to surprise their users with features that may make users feel unsafe online.  (Remember, Google tries to keep customers by providing great products, not by locking them in.  If you want to stop using Google Reader, or whatever, you can export your data to a usually-standard file format, and join a competing service instead.  That's pretty awesome, considering they make no money when you stop using their service.]<p>You can chalk this up as ""evil"", but it's just the opposite.  Google makes search results better when they can track you, so they want you to know that you're being tracked and how to opt out.  Yes, tracking is scary and the ideal situation would be not tracking anyone ever.  But that's how pre-Google search engines worked and those search engines barely worked at all.  So I don't see how Google can provide a search engine without keeping some of your data around.  They know this and want you to know, too.<p>What you should be afraid of are the companies that try to disguise what they do with your data.

You can also test your questions with specific queries (e.g. using terms that seem unlikely to be translated). Also, consider that you didn't know what results Google wasn't returning in the first place, years ago (e.g. by not having indexed them).<p>Google aims at working without thought. But it can only do so for one target audience, and unfortunately for technically minded folk, that target has to be mainstream users. Fortunately, technical folk are usually curious to explore and customize technology.<p><i>EDIT</i> just confirmed that it does use added search languages, as expected. e.g. if I add german and french, it provides: ""Search English and French and German pages"" Note: I'm not doing this for you; but because I'm curious.",1327457365

Think trade, cultural exchange, international collaboration in research (think of recent publications that often have hundreds of names on them, from many countries).<p>When you start thinking globally, term like &#x27;foreign worker&#x27; would start sounding ridiculous to you. And protectionist policies probably would stop making any sense as well.<p>On the other hand, naturalization should take some time. Fast track citizenship doesn&#x27;t make much sense, as it does take some time to get the culture of the place [e.g to serve public duties, like jury duty, etc].",1394863172

Your quote:<p>> Ukrainian Jews seek urgent help from Israel Director-general of European Jewish Association urges Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense...<p>inside the article<p>> Rabbi Menahem Margolin, has asked Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon...<p>Biography of Rabbi Menahem Margolin:<p>> Rabbi Menachem Margolin was born in Israel. After graduating from elementary studied he studied in Yeshivot in Bnei Brak and Kiryat Gat, and then in New York. From the U.S.A he left for a mission of a year to the Jewish community in Hungary and helped the local Rabbis to fulfill their rules. From Budapest he left for a mission of several months to Bangkok, Thailand. During these years he received his rabbinical ordination. In 2004 he was appointed as Program Director of the Rabbinical Centre of Europe (RCE) A year later he was appointed as the Secretary General of the organization and two years later was appointed as the General Director.<p>Yes, that guy has exactly zero to do with Ukraine. Funny that all this hysteria about neo-Nazies taking over the country is being spread from non-Ukrainian sources, while Ukrainian sources don&#x27;t see a problem.<p>> But there is another way to look at it, and it is that Russian views are correct from the outset: The Ukrainian coup that deposed a legitimately elected president has been spearheaded by neo-nazi paramilitaries.<p>Enemy invaders deposed legitimately elected leader spearheaded by antisemitic communist forces. That&#x27;s one more way to look at WWII. The problem of course that this view has nothing common with reality. Jews, Russians, Georgians, and plenty other minorities actively participated on Maidan -- something that absolutely impossible in a neo-nazi coup. And sorry, your views are not Russian views, those are views promoted by Putin propaganda.<p>> They now control key positions in the government, intimidate their political opponents, including what has remained of the Ukrainian parliament.<p>And that&#x27;s again a load of bullshit.",1394862683

(-- that is to suggest that you&#x27;re being as honest as you are about not decrypting anything the entire way from the phone through your cloud to the desktop...)<p>If it&#x27;s that secure, what would stop a botnet from theoretically leveraging this as misdirection?<p>And what is the purpose of the cloud server here?

No interest in anything online, I&#x27;m going to copy all the photos to my personal computer, and copy them onto my parents computer as well. No need to upload or manage them online, in the cloud, social networks, etc.<p>2. It needs tagging. Either labeling faces similar to Facebook, or just listing the people in a particular photo. It would also be nice to give the photo an estimated date and location.<p>3. Simple to browse, and to use tags. It would be great if you could just select a person to see all their photos, or start typing their name, and they all appear. Or select multiple people to view only photos with the group. Also, it would be useful to view by location and year. A timeline would be interesting, to scroll through the years.<p>4. It would need to work on Windows.<p>5. I doubt this feature exists anywhere, but it just popped into my mind. Attach the date of birth to people you&#x27;ve tagged. Then, using this date, and the date of the photos, you should be able to browse a person by their age. So, I could show pictures of John Doe, ages 5-10.<p>6. Some type of standard format would also be a plus, so 5 years into the future, I could export the data and face tags, and be able to load them into something else.<p>Is Picasa my only real option here? It seems like everyone is focused on web applications (including Picasa from what I&#x27;m reading, and all their Google+ features), and there&#x27;s really a lack of quality desktop applications for such a fundamental task.

You would be able to double click on that and be taken to another graph. This graph would be about the construction of a cube and would take input of width and create triangles in space to represent a cube. you could double click on the triangle node and be taken deeper, this time a node that takes vectors and defines where the surface is between them and sends it to the renderer. We could have a seperate graph to define what a vector is and the data structures behind it.<p>All of this for a simple cube could be represented as a huge tangle of nodes and connections, but we can condense it down to a single node called cube that takes an input of width. \nHaving networks and sub-networks allows you to choose what level of abstraction you work at.

That aside, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s <i>much</i> easier than using Ansible, however.<p>For Ansible, you&#x27;d need python  and Ansible. I&#x27;ll assume the official iso already has python (it&#x27;s a full iso after all) -- for ansible you&#x27;d need to install it to ram (eg: (optinally virtualenv) and pip install), or modify the iso (say with[1]). Then you&#x27;d need a (optionally set of) script(s). Then run that script through ansible. So essentially everything could be the same, but with a lot of the logic of your current script handled by ansible.<p>[1] <a href=""https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/archiso"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/archiso</a>",1394860650

Most companies I worked at come to a solution similar to:<p><pre><code>  * Install everything you need in /package_versionstr (except say glibc)\n  * Point the current version with a symlink\n</code></pre>\nThis enables you to do a simple atomic rollback/rollforward and is much easier to reason compared to complicated pkg state.<p>For simple OS config management (say usermgmt, sysctls), we used a system similar to the ideas expressed by OP.<p>1. Keep it simple. puppet/chef have horrendous DSL&#x27;s that make it really complicated to reason about. I shouldn&#x27;t have\nto debug a backtrace 15 levels deep to understand why an useradd didn&#x27;t work.<p>2. Server side logic. Don&#x27;t try to do &quot;intelligent&quot; stuff based on client side state, it will be almost impossible to get it right. All data needed for state needs to derived by group membership. This helps in\n  * validating all changes upfront\n  * diffs for state changes across a group of nodes.<p>3. No orchestration. Except any changes to be applied at any time.

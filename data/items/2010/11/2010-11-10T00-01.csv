Everyone knows that bureaucracy is bad, but if you ask a decision-maker at a big company what steps specifically they could take to reduce bureaucracy, you'll probably draw a blank.<p>A lot of this, I think, is because of a meta-problem.  Bureaucracy is basically a restriction in information flow within the organization: at some point a while ago, the right information didn't reach the right people, and so the organization instituted procedures and rules you have to follow to prevent the problem from occurring again.  But over time, information flow adapts to follow the rules instead of the shortest path from A to Z.  <i>And that prevents the people in charge from ever knowing that there's a problem.</i>  After all, the bureaucracy developed because there was too much information to fit into any one person's head, and then if they wanted to reform it, the only thing they can see is the path that information and decisions currently takes.<p>It's like Dunning-Kruger for organizations.<p>This'd explain why bureaucracy only seems to grow, never shrink, despite the best efforts to reduce bureaucracy.  It also makes me a little pesssimistic about the long-term survival of any one institution, and optimistic about the long-term need for startups.  It seems like organizations are like Microsoft operating systems: they need to be periodically rebooted to function effectively.",1289349989

Thus, after a few years, rentals bought in a sane market will generate positive cash flow; otherwise it would be foolish to buy a rental property.  (If you compare the historical price-to-rent ratio in most cities [0] with the expectation of price-to-PITI of 14 [1], you'll find that renting is indeed slightly cheaper over the short term, but only by about 20%, not 100%.)<p>In the situation you described, where mortgage is >2x equivalent rent, that's a sign you're in a bubble market.

The memory model is not a property of the program, it's a property of the platform - since in Java you're programming to the JVM platform, the fact that the platform is very exactly specified is what allows you to show that your program is race free.<p>I think you're looking for a very different sort of specification than what the JMM provides. It doesn't provide you with exact specifications of exactly how threads will behave, but no system that I'm aware of completely specifies that and any program that relies on that is fundamentally broken on any platform except exactly one version of one platform anyway - that which it was written and tested on. It's simply too dependent on the exact OS and version, the exact version of the processor, and a million other factors you can't control.<p>Instead, the JVM, the JMM and company work together to exactly specify the <i>interactions</i> between threads that are safe. It turns out that this really is all you need to know to write correct concurrent programs, and you don't have to worry about combinations of anything, or how threads are implemented, or how many processors are available, etc etc. Additionally, with the j.u.c libraries in Java 5+ there are sufficiently good abstractions that you don't need to worry about any of this low level gore much.<p>Seriously, if you're going to be writing multithreaded code in Java, read the book.

By the time we actually reached multiplication tables in grade 2, I was already able to find the areas of simple shapes like circles and trapezoids.<p>But after grade 4, I didn't receive any extra math education, and had the same education as all my peers. Never had a tutor, and I continued to get 90s in my math courses all through high school.<p>You mentioned the idea of: ""What's the point in trying? They won't let us succeed.""
And I do hear that a lot from my black peers in high school. If you say anything that can be mildly interpreted as racist, then you're in big trouble. Like ""don't walk in dark alleys at night"" trouble.

There have been a lot of innovations in the consumer Internet business that have enabled the successes of businesses like diapers.com...<p>1) Internet adoption rate is 2-3x higher now than it was in 1998.  Companies like Pets.com weren't just building their own brands, but also educating everyday people about the Internet.<p>2) There were no self-serve distribution channels like SEM or affiliate marketings that had any scale.  Google was founded the same year as Pets.com and Adwords didn't surface for a few years after that.  The only ads you could buy were CPM banners, integrated sponsorship deals (AOL bankrupted several companies with these types of deals) and offline media like TV commercials.  Additionally, media buys were a lot less accountable.  I was selling online ads at this time and some of my clients weren't even tracking registrations by source let alone sales on their website.<p>3) Businesses like Amazon and Zappos have helped create a completely different model for logistics that simply didn't exist 10-12 years ago.

In an Open Source project, the filters work very differently.  You won't find a lot of (community driven) projects that spend a lot of effort putting together detailed documentation about how to build a project and submit patches.  That's because figuring this out is the first level filter.<p>The second level filter is figuring out the architecture of the project.  This can be difficult in a subtle way.  In a company, you can usually sit in a conference room and have someone explain to you all of the details of the project such that you have a pretty good idea of how a patch or feature should be implemented.<p>In most Open Source projects, you generally have to code up an initial version of the feature and then you'll attract enough eyes that you'll get the feedback about how to do the feature properly.  If you're a long term contributor, you skip most of these steps and the process is fast.  If you've never contributed before, it's almost certainly going to take a lot of effort.<p>It's all about scalability.  Open Source projects significantly reward people that are self motivated and can figure processes out without a lot of hand holding because that's the type of person you need to build a successful project when there aren't any managers, program managers, or formal architects.<p>I think that's probably the biggest value of the proposed plan.  If someone has gotten 50 patches into a major project, it says a lot more about the individuals personality and motivation than it does about their programming skills.",1289349089
1888636,comment,1887801,1888447,0,0,ary,,,"Your difficulty and this gentleman's relative lack of difficulty finding a job probably has a lot to do with location. Second runner up is probably credibility. Let me explain.<p>My experience is in line with the author's. Finding a job has always been relatively easy (beginning at a certain point, which I will elaborate on) and I do not have a degree of any kind. It's my opinion that three factors are primarily responsible for my state of affairs.<p>1. I started working at a local ISP when I was 15 years old. This was around the time that 28.8kbps modems were all the rage. While I was <i>very</i> green I had unbounded enthusiasm and desire to learn whatever I could about technology. The ISP got a super cheap tech support person and I got paid to learn. After a year I got a chance to do UNIX sysadmin work, and my level of experience began to snowball.<p>The (fairly obvious) takeaway here is that I built experience. Businesses don't want to train you if they can help it. Not able to find a learn-on-the-job opportunity? Take the author's advice and contribute to an interesting open source project.<p>2. Befriending an employee of one of the largest ISPs in the United States ended up landing me a development position on a pretty large contract. I worked damn hard, and ended up contributing in a fairly visible way. Because the job was for a company in the Fortune 50 I've since been able to point to it as social proof that I at least have a vague idea of what I'm doing. Employers love this. This is when job hunting became dramatically easier.<p>You may think the takeaway here is to be lucky, but I disagree. The takeaway is to get to know people that you can develop mutually beneficial relationships with. To this day I still get contract work and referrals from people I worked with on that one job.<p>3. Location. Companies will sometimes relocate you, but I've never seen one that will do it without there being a very compelling reason to have you on staff (ie, experience and a proven track record). <i>You have to go where the jobs are.</i> Sometimes you have to suck it up, move away from your family and friends, become a nobody, and start pulling in a paycheck. Once you do you can start planning (and saving) for the luxury of living and working in a desirable place.<p>The takeaway here? Get away from the crowd. In my experience there are at least two good markets for developers, Denver/Boulder CO (Denver being easier than Boulder), and Kansas City MO/KS. I'm not a big fan of Kansas or Missouri (sorry natives, you're all great people), but Colorado is a beautiful place with lots to do outside your cube/apartment. The job markets in both those places are reasonable and you can be relatively well paid even with limited experience. How do they compare with SF/NYC? Not even close, but it's way easier to stand out from the crowd when there is no crowd. Being in the middle of nowhere can sometimes be a benefit.<p>All that said, good luck.",1289349057

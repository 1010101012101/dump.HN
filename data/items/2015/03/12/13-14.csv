Or embedding markup in JavaScript?<p>It makes it possible to implement React&#x27;s componentisation model in a performant manner.<p>It allows React to not only work in all major browsers <i>today</i>, but to use its SyntheticEvent implementation to patch up and normalise aspects of their behaviour which are important when writing webapps.<p>While React&#x27;s ideas about data flow might not be new, the componentisation model it uses to implement them makes it incredibly easy to compose and reuse UI components, with a well-defined method of passing data between them and controlling re-rendering.<p>It allows React components to be easily pre-rendered on the server and rehydrated to be interactive on the client from the initial markup using the same codebase, making progressive enhancement easier to implement, therefore more likely to be implemented.<p>That&#x27;s why the virtual DOM isn&#x27;t the most interesting thing about React, rather what it enables.<p>It would be nice if native Web Components just <i>worked</i> everywhere right now, but they don&#x27;t. Maybe some day React will just another way to implement the innards of a native Web Component, but at the moment it&#x27;s just <i>better</i> then them.",1426168787

Making sure that texts and buttons align, choosing color schemes, takes a lot of time. A large fraction of the code is UI code, so minimizing the amount of time spent on coding the UI is a quick way to safe time and money.<p>2) Beautiful design requires authority. When you make a twitter client, you can just scrap that confusing feature that noone will use. In enterprise world, you need to implement every stupid feature the client wants even if it makes the product worse. No amount of taste or design can fix an interface that is broken in principle.",1426168770

It is not &quot;my use of the word power&quot; but simply <i>power</i>. You did the same thing when we discussed sexism, which is an academic term invented relatively recently by feminist scholars, which you insisted on treating as some obscure, ill-defined notion. This tone shows a misplaced contempt to a vast scholarly endeavor.<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t see how that critique applies to power at all, because, yet again, some of the mechanics involving power are well known and well documented. Nobody says &quot;power makes it so&quot;. It&#x27;s just that explaining the power dynamics of racial neighborhood segregation or sexism in tech would take dozens of pages.<p>It is not simply that &quot;power is what drives women participation in tech down&quot;. I can trace a process -- some documented and some hypothesized -- starting with &quot;classical&quot; gender roles, through the massive transition in gender roles and general separation between the sexes that occurred in Victorian times (they had rooms in houses meant to serve men and rooms for women) and shapes society to this day, through the history of women in computing (starting with the transition of switchboards from being seen as a job for women to one for men), with the more general association of which jobs are for men and for women. That would take me about 50 pages, I guess. But power is the central mechanism. I&#x27;m not saying &quot;power did it&quot;; I can show <i>how</i>.

There are no closed-form formulas in the social sciences; at least not yet.<p>> a discussion with tptacek on crypto or kasey_junk on high speed trading<p>Maybe they&#x27;re just better communicators than me, and maybe HFT is more amenable to discussion in HN comments than the history of gender roles and the evolution of power in human society. However, if you have specific questions (and they would have to be more specific than &quot;how come there are fewer women in tech&quot;) I could try to answer succinctly if it is at all possible. The problem is that these are things that are never even taught to first-year social sciences students (some are only taught in grad school), and unlike with HFT, I don&#x27;t think you even have the basics.<p>For example, I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re at all familiar with the techniques used to study history or sociology, how historical documents are analyzed, how different societies are compared etc., and I really can&#x27;t lay out an intro to social studies here (BTW, that Curtis Yarvin guy I told you about suffers from the same problem, except he considers himself knowledgable for some reason. His writings read like an Aristotelian scholar discussing quantum mechanics; he&#x27;s completely ill equipped to handle the materials he&#x27;s using, which is why he draws such ridiculous conclusions. Of the months spent teaching students simply how to approach reading documents, he doesn&#x27;t even apply the very first lesson: classifying the genre of the document and identifying the intended audience and purpose)<p>Now, I&#x27;m sure that there are some introductory materials to gender studies that skip the basics of social science, but I doubt you&#x27;ll find them convincing if you&#x27;re not familiar with the methodology. If you are interested, I could try to find some online course in history or sociology that seems good, but my guess is that they won&#x27;t get to gender roles in an intro course (and if they do, it will be by skipping the groundwork, which, again, will make it seem less convincing).<p>> Note that you still haven&#x27;t actually provided an experiment or measurement that could identify a successful yet powerless group (if such a thing existed), or vice versa.<p>You still haven&#x27;t provided an example of a planetary system whose planets revolve around a star due to a force other than gravity! Gravity <i>is</i> what makes planets revolve around a star, and power is the mechanism by which groups (and individuals) obtain success. Once in a while there are aberrations, to which I have provided examples: winning the lottery. Or, if California is covered by the ocean, then the very powerful people who live their might become extremely unsuccessful. Of course <i>because</i> that population is powerful, various disasters would probably be addressed by the government faster and with more rigor than in other parts of the US, but that may still happen.",1426168393

It’s also why I was at least a little bit glad when the megaupload/rapidshare sites were taken down. There may be an argument to be made about traffic costs and the like, but that doesn’t legitimize anything.<p>Nevertheless, the real issue here is that those services exist because there is demand for them and the &quot;legitimate suppliers&quot; don’t seem to feel a need to attend it. As Valve’s founder put it &quot;Piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem&quot;.<p>Is there any service out there with Netflix-level breadth of the titles available? Is there any service out there that let‘s you watch without having your name associated to &quot;adult videos&quot; in various databases? Is there anywhere people can turn to when still underage? Is there anywhere people can go to for getting the latest &quot;fappening&quot; leaks?<p>Hence piracy.<p>Yes, some of those reasons may be questionable or outright wrong, but given that the situation is what it is, why not try to at least make the best out of it and settle for some youtube-like service/agreement where the content creators will get at least some share of he profits and at least some control over the contents can be retained?<p>The argument about torrents vs &quot;tubes&quot; however seems pretty irrelevant. If you want HQ videos, don’t mind the wait and have plenty of storage available then torrents are likely the better choice. If you need something <i>right now</i>, don’t have much bandwith or storage and don’t care much for quality, a steaming service might work well enough for you.

If a piece of Rust code let&#x27;s uninitialized values bleed through, then it is broken. The semantics of Rust demands this.

That is:<p>1. Program receives a packet and wants 100 bytes of memory for it.\n2. It asks custom_allocator to give it a 100 byte chunk. custom_allocator gives it a fresh 100 byte chunk, which is correctly initialized because this is Rust.\n3. Program is done with that chunk...\n4. ...but custom_allocator is not. It marks the 100 byte chunk as free for it to use them again, but continues to retain ownership and does not clear its contents.\n5. Program receives a packet that claims it has 100 bytes of payload, so it asks custom_allocator to give it a chunk of 100 bytes. custom_allocator gives it <i>the same chunk as before</i>, without asking the Rust runtime for another (initialized!) chunk. Program is free to roam around those 100 bytes, too.<p>I.e. the semantics of Rust do not allow for data to be uninitialized, but custom_allocator sidesteps that.",1426166556

9190537,comment,9189553,9189940,0,0,cabinpark,,,">I&#x27;m amazed that you say that calculus has had a much greater impact on society when virtually every database, graphics manipulation or economic analysis uses principles of linear algebra.<p>I&#x27;m not. Consider all of physics. Physics is written down in terms of differential equations. You need calculus to get these equations. In terms of graphics, for example, are you magically creating only static images that never change in time? How do you think people came up with the algorithms to do things like refraction or reflection? These all involve calculus. Calculus is the most important tool in applying mathematics to the real world. It is how we derive the models for pretty much everything I can think of. Any time you want to model something where anything changes, that is calculus. Any time you want to find an optimal solutions, that is calculus. I can&#x27;t think of a single area of applied mathematics that doesn&#x27;t use calculus in some form. Even mathematics in general, calculus is used  in some form pretty much everywhere in some form, except maybe in the foundations of mathematics like set theory or logic.<p>Solving them, on the other hand, is a different problem. This is where linear algebra is important. When solving an ODE or PDE, when I discretise it, all I am doing is re-writing it as a giant linear algebra problem. Quantum mechanics, for example, is dedicated to finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian. Linear algebra provides the tools to solve the problems posed by calculus. But it isn&#x27;t always required.<p>In fact, if you look at the history of linear algebra, it only really became wide-spread when quantum mechanics was developing since there is a deep connection between linear algebra and quantum mechanics. Heisenberg had never heard of a matrix before despite discovering Heisenberg matrix mechanics.  He was told by Max Born that what he had been doing is actually this thing mathematicians called &quot;matrices&quot;. Now linear algebra is a required course for physicists (incidentally, linear algebra was the first lecture I ever attended at university).<p>So I would argue that learning calculus is the most important thing someone should know mathematically, since it is the tool we use to build models. The second most is linear algebra since it provides us the tools to solve these problems. But in my mind, knowing how to derive these models is a lot more important than being able to solve them. That and linear algebra doesn&#x27;t give you any insight into why we are solving the problem that way, it is just a tool to solve the problem.<p>Also in Calculus 1,2,3 and so on, you learn increasingly more complicated techniques of calculus to solve more problems. But when you start numerically solving them, linear algebra doesn&#x27;t care. It doesn&#x27;t care if your equation came from the Einstein field equations or Newton&#x27;s second law. It&#x27;s all the same to it. So in a sense, I can teach you everything you&#x27;ll need to know about linear algebra in a single course but the same is not true of calculus, which requires multiple courses.",1426166308

9190485,story,,,35,23,wolfer,"UK startup accelerators take matched service charges on top of invested capital?",,"Recently myself and co-founders applied to a UK startup accelerator in the hopes of obtaining initial seed funding to kickstart our startup.<p>In the process of negotiating terms, it was slipped into conversation that the accelerator actually invests double the amount requested into the business (artificially inflating the business valuation and potentially creating some pretty big burnrate questions for future investors), which is paid directly to the accelerator on receipt of funds as a service charge.<p>This service charge is apparently there to facilitate the other &quot;free&quot; mentorship, office space and introductions that the accelerator offers.<p>It seems like this is a bit of a tax fiddle from an SEIS (Seed Enterprise Investment Fund) perspective, as all they are doing is draining the fund to essentially pay themselves, exposing very little risk, but obtaining a decent equity share in a new start up business. This also eats into the £150k of available SEIS funding, as a chunk of it is not invested at all, just leaving through the backdoor to pay the accelerator.<p>Is this commonplace and is anyone aware of other accelerators doing the same thing?",1426165694

Not necessarily as in a corrupt, evil way, but just the ability to impact the world on a national or global scale. The difference between a millionaire and a billionaire isn&#x27;t how many private islands they can buy, it&#x27;s how many people can be paid to further their goals, whatever those goals may be. Usually, this comes in the form of companies and/or politics. More money and more companies lets you change the world.

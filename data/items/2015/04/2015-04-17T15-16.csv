9395129,comment,9392491,9393689,0,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>The question is _are you going to want to_ continue using a 10 year old laptop? That&#x27;s an eternity in technological terms.</i><p>That might have been true 10 years ago, when typical speeds and storage capacities were increasing dramatically from one generation to the next <i>and</i> those increases were actually useful.<p>But even entry-level PCs have been able to run typical home or office applications -- things like reading e-mail, browsing the web, writing a letter or putting together a spreadsheet -- for a very long time. You don&#x27;t (or at least shouldn&#x27;t) need an i7 hexacore processor overclocked to 4+GHz and 16GB of RAM to write a letter. The only sharp improvements in recent years have been high-resolution displays (much more important on smaller screens, but generally a noticeable benefit) and SSDs (particularly in much faster boot/load times on otherwise modestly specified machines), and for applications that need them, GPUs.<p>Even for more demanding applications that really do benefit from greater RAM and processing power, the real world specs for both processors and typical system RAM have barely moved the needle for probably 5 years now, with the emphasis more on low power consumption and more cores within a single CPU. The cost/benefit for upgrading even a high-end workstation from a few years ago to the state of the art today is rarely favourable.<p>The biggest problems with longevity today, in my experience, are monolithic hardware where components can&#x27;t be swapped out on failure and, more than anything, <i>software</i>. The reason my third-generation iPad isn&#x27;t as useful any more has nothing to do with the hardware spec, it&#x27;s because Apple chose to write more recent versions of iOS in a certain way and then forced the app ecosystem to upgrade because they have absolute control via the App Store. Now we have a choice between not using a lot of newer apps or upgrading to a new version of iOS (which is widely reported not to work reliably on our equipment, and with no way to downgrade again if those reports prove to be accurate in our case). All of this is entirely due to artificial problems caused by a throwaway software culture, and nothing to do with the hardware.",1429286203

It seems entirely appropriate to me.<p>I&#x27;m admittedly no proper scholar of the subject, just a former armchair enthusiast, but when I read texts from the Pali canon it seems clear to me that from the earliest recorded times Buddhism has considered itself a living tradition.  In the stories it tells, Gautama Buddha often refuses to weigh in on those sorts of matters.  Fast forward a couple thousand years and you&#x27;ve got things like a letter in which a major Zen patriarch explicitly refuses to offer any opinion on a point of &quot;theological&quot; disagreement between Pure Land Buddhism and his own sect.

At one point there were competing desktop environments - Desqview, OS/2.<p>...<p>> There is also the antitrust argument: control over the OEMs restricts the possibilities for competing software.<p>Which of these arguments would you like to keep?  You can&#x27;t have both; or at least, they don&#x27;t refer to overlapping time periods.  And I&#x27;d take issue with either: in the first case, MS <i>always</i> had the option early on of carving a controlled niche rather than trying for wide appeal. That&#x27;s <i>exactly</i> what early Apple did, and I&#x27;d argue that MS could have done precisely the same on PC hardware, if they&#x27;d chosen to.  As regards the anti-trust argument, why don&#x27;t we see that being levelled at Apple?  An MS which chose to drive a more closed ecosystem <i>probably</i> wouldn&#x27;t have been so utterly dominant as to run the risk of antitrust accusations, and again, that was their choice.<p>> They then faced the upgrade problem: at any point, restrictive control over drivers would mean that hardware that ran Windows N-1 would not run Windows N.<p>Again, that was their choice.<p>> And there&#x27;s a limit to what they can do. My latest driver/hardware bug was discovering that my Crucial MX100 has some horrible interaction with write caching and link power management such that it can vanish from underneath the operating system.<p>I&#x27;d argue that this sort of problem affects either sort of ecosystem.",1429286014

It&#x27;s a problem that exists even with a single instrument.<p>The problem is that, even on a single instrument (say a piano), if you start on some note (say C0), going up seven octaves should land you on exactly the same note as going up twelve perfect fifths (C7).  The problem is that the precise <i>tuning</i> of that C7 is different depending on if you followed the perfect octaves or perfect fifths.<p>If you followed perfect octaves, which have a ratio of 2/1 (or just 2), C7 should have a tuning of precisely (2^7)·C0 = 128·C0.  If you followed perfect fifths, which have a ratio of 3/2, C7 should have a tuning of precisely ((3/2)^12)·C0 = ~129.74·C0.  The difference between these two is the Pythagorean comma.<p>Equal temperament solves this problem by keeping the octaves perfect (2:1), but compromising on everything else.

I imagine all Mac users who say they can&#x27;t ever leave the Apple trackpad are environmentally limited to using whatever is built-in to the laptop.<p>In other words - when I work, I prefer 2 or 3 monitors that are situated about 2 feet from my face and a full size keyboard with numpad (Microsoft Natural).

A seller must store goods, prepare them for shipping, and in many cases add value to the product in some way (e.g. refurbishing is common, which includes cost for all related equipment). Again, not a perfect analogy, but offloading costs to the seller/driver seems to bear some resemblance between the two.<p>Setting the rates is a strong argument in favor of a relationship more toward the traditional employee end of the spectrum. I think I need to think about this more.<p>As to the tips, I glossed over that section so I am glad you&#x27;ve raised it here. I do not know the exact details of the agreement between Uber and drivers as regards tips, but this seems at first glance to be a pretty severe violation of <i>any</i> relationship between driver and Uber. I agree this needs to be addressed, and a class-action suit does seem appropriate here. I think this can and should be viewed independently from any classification as partner/employee.<p>>My only opinion on this is that the balance should probably be tilted a little more in the workers&#x27; favor for these arrangements, although I am not sure full categorization as an employee would be the correct approach.<p>I think you&#x27;re right on this point. I am still unsure as to what I think is best to achieve this. My initial reaction is to ensure that there is an environment where competitors are likely; I believe a strict requirement on the type of relationship between company and driver will only hamper this (limit the type of relationships => limit the viable business models => limit the possible solution space).",1429285031

9394861,comment,9394089,9394607,0,0,wpietri,,,"Thanks. I too am in favor of open dialogue, but with a couple exceptions. These exceptions really bug me, because by masquerading as dialogue they reduce the opportunity for real dialoue.<p>One is when open dialogue is used as a cloak for social control. The extreme example here is the Westboro Baptist Church, which pickets with signs that say, &quot;God Hates Fags&quot;. A historical example is all the people picketing during school integration in the US. But there are a zillion subtle examples where people today, often unconsciously, say and do things that act to maintain historical imbalances.<p>Another is when discussion participants aren&#x27;t acting responsibly. I forever see dudes sea-lioning their way into some advanced discussion on feminism, saying ignorant and/or harmful things, and then getting upset when they&#x27;re called out. Real dialogue requires new participants to approach with humility and respect. Nobody expects it to be ok to for somebody off the street to barge into a graduate physics seminar and start opining. Those people will promptly get bounced, and surely go away complaining. But topics like feminism and race relations also have long histories. People jumping in to serious discussions should know something; they are not entitled to an on-the-spot education that stops the advanced discussion from progressing.<p>I&#x27;d also add that as I have come to better understand the experience of other people, I&#x27;m a lot more forgiving of possibly misdirected anger from marginalized people. A (white) sysadmin pal has a permanent, visceral dislike of cops because he was once assaulted by a cop who mistook him for somebody who had just shot a brother officer. Intellectually he knows that most cops are fine, but if somebody puts you in the ER, intellect only takes you so far. He just now doesn&#x27;t trust cops in general; each individual officer has to demonstrate that they are safe before he feels safe.<p>Knowing how much bullshit has been perpetrated by people who look like me, I just accept that some people are going to initially see me as a probable threat. I am just always going to be Schrodinger&#x27;s rapist [1] to a lot of women. I&#x27;m going to be Schrodinger&#x27;s racist to a lot of black people.

Where once the type of person to spout their hateful rhetoric would be simply ignored, through social media they have been enabled, given a voice to, and been able to form an echo-chamber with other similarly deluded, hate-fueled people.<p>Through their network they have wielded an undue amount of power and we have unfortunately witnessed the result of it in real life, as a man who landed a probe on a comet millions of miles away had his team&#x27;s achievement pushed to the back in favour of the furor over the shirt he wore while doing so, and who then wept on TV as a result of the sheer level of hate he received.<p>We have seen GitHub shamed for its rug championing unity in meritocracy, who then quickly moved to throw the &quot;problematic&quot; rug into the trash amidst the furor from these online &quot;feminists&quot;.<p>We saw two people lose their jobs and have their names ran into the ground online by these &quot;feminists&quot; over a bad joke at a tech convention.<p>And the list goes on.<p>They have become simply too large to ignore. Their presence, and their narrative, drives so many clicks that we now see the &quot;tech media&quot; latch onto it, give their toxic views air and promote their narrative in the name of gaining clicks.<p>Facts no longer matter when it comes to these people, only the narrative. It doesn&#x27;t matter that Ellen Pao was proven to have no case against Kleiner Perkins and was exposed as an incredibly shady person while doing so, you wouldn&#x27;t tell she lost as the media driving this narrative cherry picked that which was convenient to the narrative and brushed over everything which was not.<p>I could go on about this, but all I will say is that I&#x27;m glad to see backlash against this movement increasing. I&#x27;m glad to see more speaking out against it. I&#x27;m glad to see their hashtags on Twitter being used against them, and I&#x27;m <i>extremely</i> glad to see some of their champions like Sarah Noble being held accountable in real life for the hate they spew online.",1429283843

Power consumption is roughly proportional to the cube of speed, so to get the Solar Impulse 2&#x27;s cruise speed up to, say, 150kts instead of the 49kts it actually does would require 27x more solar collection surface area. If you want to carry two people instead of one, it&#x27;ll need to be about twice again as big. You&#x27;ll hit annoying scaling laws since larger structures are proportionally weaker so it&#x27;ll get even worse.",1429282940

An example would be the reasons people use bike helmets. No one uses bike helmets in Berlin, because Berlin is safe for bicycles, and that is partly due to the respect that cars and trucks show to bikers. In the USA, car culture is stronger, and car drivers are much more aggressive. I&#x27;ve gotten into the equivalent of tug-of-war situations with taxis, trying to exercise my right to turn, when they want to turn in the opposite direction: the taxi drivers are willing to use the vast bulk of their car in a threatening manner. You never see that in Berlin. In New York City, one is justified wearing a helment, and one would be justified wearing elbow and knee pads (but I never had). It&#x27;s an aggressive environment.<p>Also, in New York, the roads are often chaotic. In Berlin, I only saw chaos around construction sites, otherwise the roads were safe and orderly.<p>Also, I could rent a bicycle in Berlin, very cheaply, and then keep it for days. There is nothing exactly so convenient in New York.<p>All the same, I am pleased that the situation is getting better in New York.",1429282810

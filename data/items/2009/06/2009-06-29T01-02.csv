678355,comment,678302,678302,0,0,patio11,,,"Quality translation is not cheap.  This is partially because there are numerous places where the market for it is not as efficient as it could be.  However, it is mostly because it is <i>freaking hard</i>.  (I do J->E technical translation for the day job on occasion.  You need to have a superset of the knowledge base of an intermediate Java engineer to do it well.  I got to rewrite a description of what a SQL injection attack was written by someone who had never used SQL, who faithfully translated a description they found in a well-known Japanese desk reference for engineers.  They produced comprehensible English which was, well, wrong.)<p>Come to think of it, translation is a classic market for lemons, isn't it.  The people who need it the most are the least capable of assessing the quality of the deliverables, which is why everyone here has heard of All Your Base Are Belong To Us.  This results in both people paying absurd amounts of money for mediocre translation and, hmm, large companies thinking that their crowdsourced translation presents their company in the best possible light.<p>There's so many ways a crowdsourcing solution like this can go wrong.  I wish I could show you a concrete example but I don't have any good examples of Japanese businesses that used the technique off the top of my head.  If you guys want I can dredge up an example or two from Facebook or whatever, but I'm not quite as plugged into the Japanese Internet so I miss most of the inevitable snickering.",1246240582

So as long as you write a custom VM adhering to the JVM spec you are good. There are a few competitors to Sun claiming to have faster VMs.<p>While Sun's JVM only recently went open source, the spec was always open and sun does not have a history of suing open-source competitors to oblivion to prevent competition.<p>What this guy is saying is that C# is not like that. You take a risk when using C# that eventually you might wind up being forced to use proprietary windows-only software.<p>I still think the rant is rediculous. MS will never kill mono. MS wants to give everyone a first hit. Then they come in in shining armor with bags of coke claiming that now that you know mono, check out these libraries; now that you know these libraries writing windows-only programs is super easy.<p>Essentially C# + .Net is MS' Objective-C + Coca. They don't want it to die. The fact that people REALLY like .net and ported it to linux is an indication that .Net might be a good piece of work if anything. come to think of it... if Objective-C is so wonderful why is it not widely used in linux???

I thought it pretty clear by now that people advance through the educational system to their abilities.  You can fiddle with methodologies and testing all you want, but the raw material is what it is.<p>Government funding of scientific research <i>is</i> the problem.  About two thirds of scientists make their living off the government, directly or indirectly.  We need less of that, not more.  Scientists need to stop making ultimately useless death machines for the DOD and other government agencies and they need to start working on technologies for the free market.  Eliminating DARPA and throwing all the scientists who depend on it out of work would be a good start.  They'd be forced to come up with business ideas.<p>The problem with health care in America isn't that too many aren't ""covered,"" it's that too many can't afford medicines and procedures because they're too expensive.  Costs and prices need to be driven down.  That would happen right away if you eliminated the tax deductibility of health care benefits.  (Maybe give an offsetting tax credit to make it political palatable.)  Millions of people would opt out of their employer provided plans and go comparison shopping for much cheaper high deductible plans so they could pocket the savings.  This consumer driven pressure would force insurance prices down dramatically.  The high deductibles of these cheap plans would have people comparison shopping for the cheapest medical services, which they basically don't do now.

She says that these kids are speaking AAVE because thats what they know; its not wrong  its their language. She thus advocates teaching students who speak AAVE at home the concept of code-switching. The general idea is simply the notion of switching between two different languages as needed.</i>",1364939971

5482424,comment,5480095,5480095,1,0,mikestew,,,"It seems at least some on here know a bit about the company, and seem impressed by the concept at least. I know next to nothing about them, so let me give you the view of the proverbial ""Joe Sixpack"". Summary: I know of only one vendor that uses it, and LevelUp has to overcome my objections to using it right there at the point-of-sale.<p>There's one restaurant that my wife and I go to that has the POS thingy. We live in Redmond, not exactly a town full of tech-averse folk. So problem #1 is: is it worth the trouble of signing up, dealing with one more daily email newsletter (because I forgot to uncheck the box), and having to get my phone out and find the app every time we eat there? Answer: a resounding ""no"".<p>Problem #2: you have to sell me at the point-of-sale, because I frankly don't care enough to go look it up. What does LevelUp do, other than having a glowing thing that wants to have something to do with my phone? I have no idea, probably something to do with paying for my meal. If that's the only answer I can come with at the time of sale, I refer you to Problem #1.<p>Problem #3: I know of only one vendor in tech-savvy Redmond, WA that uses it. Why even bother to dirty my inbox and the app screen of my phone?<p>Problem #4: how's the user experience? Does it suck? Do rainbows and unicorns sprout from my phone when I use it? I have no idea. What I do know is that whipping out my credit card is quick and easy, and everyone involved in the transaction knows how to go through the motions. LevelUp competes against a known quantity, and that known quantity is actually pretty good.<p>From reading the comments, I gather that there's some kind of rewards system. Hmm, first I knew of it (see POS sales problem). Not exactly a positive for me, as I'm growing tired of loyalty cards and variations thereof.<p>So that's the view of a guy who knows almost nothing about LevelUp. Too much to fiddle with, and no perceived value for me.",1364939945
5482423,comment,5479848,5479848,4,0,BoredAstronaut,,,"I'm not sure how long the OP has been an arm-chair social scientist, but I've been one for twenty-five years, and I feel like I might be able to share some insights.<p>Firstly, his thesis could be boiled down to a very simple question: ""Why do people do what they do (instead of what I want them to do)?"" You suggest that they are insufficiently self-reflective, not very world-wise, and perhaps just a bit self-centred. These are reasonable inferences, but they don't go very deeply into understand the psychology, beliefs and motivations of your stereotypical spoiled white kid.<p>A deeper question we might ask in response to your thesis is, ""What's wrong with the world (and why is nobody fixing it)?"" The sub-question might alternately be: ""Why aren't enough people fixing it?"" or ""Why aren't the right people fixing it?"" Ne spoiled rich kids.<p>The problem with both questions is that they are primarily underscored by the implicit question, ""Why aren't more people like me (and why don't they believe and feel like I do)?"" But the answer to that is simple: evolution. Biological evolution ensures that there is a wide variety of people, physiologically, and social evolution (not Social Darwinism, thank you -- no ranking is being proposed) ensures that there are a wide variety of belief systems and mental models of how the world works and why.<p>But let's, for the moment, make the (unfounded and highly unlikely) assumption that the OP's point of view is somehow more informed, insightful, rational, or just generally ""better"" than those of all the people whom he is criticizing. I mean, he wouldn't have made the argument if he didn't think it had more merit than other arguments in favour of ""iterating"" or whatever other less noble activity they are pursuing instead. And he may be right (it's only unlikely based on probability, and the apparent level of effort pursued in constructing said argument).<p>People do what they do because they believe, rightly or wrongly, that it is in their interests. Either directly, in terms of immediate material rewards, through indirect rewards (material, social or even spiritual), or future rewards to their offspring. That is a basic economic tenet that is difficult to ignore. (It is hard to disprove, partly because ""rewards"" are variable and ill-defined). Stated another way, people do things because they think (or feel) that it is right (or reasonable) to do, or just because they want to do them.<p>It may be for riches, or that may merely be a subordinate goal towards pleasure, happiness, fulfillment or meaning. My suspicion is that people are primarily motivated by status (a measure of what is meaningful) when they behave in ways that affect their social surroundings, but otherwise they like pleasure, whether sensual, aesthetic or moral (and the pride or satisfaction from doing good is definitely a pleasure, as is that of winning, which could be called a moral activity, if you believe you are better than other people and deserve to win).<p>But not only do people do what they believe is good for their interests, they also don't do things that they think are bad for their interests, which is the true meaning of ""wasting time"": actions without real consequence (as estimated by the agent). This isn't bad or evil. Most people simply do not know how to ""change the world"" in a manner which will satisfy the OP, or at best have a very vague notion, and very little reason to be confident that they could do it. In other words, people engage in activities which they consider to have a reasonable chance of success. Exactly how they arrived at their estimate of risk/reward is another question.<p>But in fact it is the ultimate question, since that is where the rubber meets the road. The extent to which someone is misinformed, delusional or outright insane is something that has to be determined for each individual. But we can generalize that the vast majority of people do not have the necessary knowledge, skills, insights and experience to go about saving the world. Nor do they have the right social connections, or  affiliations with groups which are changing the world (and have no interest in becoming fund-raisers hanging out on malls and street corners), and are generally discouraged from participating in such marginal activities by their elders and role models, for many reasons (some or all of which may be ill-reasoned, based on false premises, and riddled with superstitions, false authority and bias, and yet are nevertheless core to the world view which these people have at their disposal).<p>So, for the OP's sake, maybe it's time that he revised his viewpoint on what is wrong with the world, and how to change it. Not by writing blog posts accusing others of failing to live up to his standards (yes, this could be ironic, but in fact I am not judging the OP's career or life goals, merely his argument), but instead by either a) trying to understand better why people don't, in fact, share his beliefs and values, and/or b) by learning how to impart his own wisdom in such a way that he has some modicum of hope in actually affecting the views of other people, rather than just appealing to a crowd of like-minded people with whom he can share his sense of superiority.<p>On the other hand, maybe that was his goal, and maybe he achieved it, so good for him!",1364939930

splat is a function that takes a function and returns a function that takes a list and returns a list<p><pre><code>  splat :: (function)->((list)->list)

That is sort of effectively the reverse order of parameters for map. What applyFirst does is, it takes a function and a parameter and returns a function that takes more params and prepends the given one. applyLast is similar, but appends the given one. Let's walk through the application of applyFirst(applyLast, map)(fn)(list)<p><pre><code>  applyFirst(applyLast, map)(fn)(list)
  applyLast(map, fn)(list) -- here applyFirst has supplied the map param to applyLast and fn is the given param

If you supply more parameters, you'd get:<p><pre><code>  applyFirst(applyLast, map)(a, b)(c, d)

That is still pretty viable, although a lot of judges now are getting reluctant to turn those massive list of IPs into names.<p>They seem to be running into trouble mainly because they decided that it would be much easier to be their own client: have a shell company purchase the porn video and take 100% of the settlements. But then that runs into issues with attorney-client separation, and then they used some appropriated names on the shell company to limit the paper trail, and suddenly there is real trouble brewing.",1364939429

I have been looking for a job for three months now but haven't been able to find anything. And I don't think that I'm _too_ picky. 
One problem is that I just don't know where to look (I live in Berlin, GER right now but I'm willing to move and would also work remotely).<p>I do backend development (Rails, Sinatra, Django), frontend development and design - I'm also interested in working with hardware (e.g. microcontrollers).
I have experience in QA and concepting, too. 
I don't want to work for ""evil"" people and I want to be allowed to speak out my own ideas. I want to work in an open-minded environment where creativity and new technologies are welcomed and not restrained. 
Or is that already being too picky? :/<p>I know a lot of people who are just hustling along in jobs they hate for years because that's the way it is. 
Or at least they tell that themselves and me. 
I've been there, too but I don't want a job just for the sake of having a job. 
Building something for months and seeing it being flushed down the toilet immediately is kind of hard -even if you get paid for it in the end. 
Especially when you're just getting started working as a web developer.<p>If you can help me out or give some tips - this would be really great!
If you want to know more about me, drop me a mail.<p>Thanks! :)",1364938838

valued function of a real variable) y(t).<p>We assume that at the present t = 0 and that we have
y(0), that is, the current number of customers.<p>We let the number of customers who will ever try our
business be b. That is, b is our intended 'market
potential'.<p>Initially we assume that once we get a person as a
customer, we do not ever lose them but keep them
forever.<p>As usual, we let y'(t) = dy(t)/dt be the calculus
first derivative of y(t). Then y'(t) is number of
new customers per day, that is, the 'rate' at which
we gain customers.<p>For 'virality' we notice that that is proportional
to (1) the number of customers y(t) we have
'talking' about our business and (2) the number of
people<p><pre><code>     b - y(t)
</code></pre>
yet to be our our customers hearing the talking.<p>Then we have that for some constant of
proportionality k<p><pre><code>     y'(t) = k y(t) (b - y(t))
</code></pre>
So we have an initial value problem (that is, we
know y(0)) for a first order (we use only the first
derivative) ordinary (no partial derivatives)
differential equation.<p>Then from calculus,<p><pre><code>     y(t) = y(0) b exp(bkt) /
            ( y(0)( exp(bkt) - 1) + b))
</code></pre>
So this solution grows (1) initially slowly, (2)
then more rapidly, (3) then more slowly and
approaches b asymptotically from below.<p>In case we lose some customers forever at some rate
r, then we get the same solution except k and b get
adjusted.<p>Once there was a startup (now a major company) that
was struggling and had as an investor a major
company with a Board seat and at the startup two
representatives, one in finance and the other in
aeronautical engineering.<p>The two representatives had asked for some revenue
growth projections.<p>People around the HQ considered what the startup
hoped, intended, thought might happen, etc., but
found nothing credible.<p>One guy who remembered calculus reluctantly got
involved, formulated and solved the differential
equation above, and showed the solution to a Senior
VP of Planning (SVP) who reported to the founder,
CEO, COB. The SVP was responsible for the
projections.  The SVP took the guy's calculus
solution as the basis of the projections and on a
Friday sat with the guy with a pocket calculator and
some graph paper and graphed solutions to the
differential equation for selected values of the
constant k and picked one of the solutions as the
official projection.<p>The next day, Saturday, at about noon, the guy was
in his office working on some other math problems
and got a call from a person asking if he knew about
the projections for the Board and if he could come
over to the HQ?  Sure.  When the guy arrived, the
situation was grim:  The two representatives of the
major Board Member were standing in the hall with
their bags packed with airline tickets back to
Texas.  The startup was about to die.<p>The SVP was traveling and out of town.<p>The person who had called got the graph of
projections from the previous day and asked the guy
to reproduce a point on the graph.  Using the
calculator, the solution above, and a few
keystrokes, the point on the graph was reproduced.
After several more points were reproduced, the area
became happier; the two representatives on the
Board stayed, and the startup was saved.<p>Later the person who had called explained that that
Saturday was a Board meeting, the growth projection
graph was shown, and the two representatives had
asked how the projections were calculated.  The rest
of the company tried to reproduce the graph but
could not.  The Board meeting stopped.  The two
representatives lost patience with the startup, got
airline tickets back to Texas, returned to their
rented rooms, packed their bags, and as a last
chance returned to the startup to see if there was
an answer to how the projections were calculated.<p>Ah, one saved startup!  One reason to take calculus

Maybe not Nash or Knuth amazing, or Norman Borlaug amazing, but something of lasting value and worth that made the world a better place in innumerable ways.</i><p>Yeah, I know the feeling.  When I started my first real programming job, I spent a lot of time wondering if I'd made the right choice, and trying to figure out how - if at all - this job would lead to a scenario where I could say I changed the world in some sense.  One of my biggest fears is, as you say, to have never been (for how I define ""having been"").  I sometimes thing, if I live a life where I do enough of note to one day justify having a Wikipedia page, then I could probably live with that.<p>It's interesting though... I saw an interview with a UFC fighter once (I think it might have been Dan Henderson, but don't hold me to that) where he was asked ""What are your goals in life"" and said something like ""I want to be in the history books.  Not the history books of ultimate fighting, but the history books kids read in school"".   I feel like that sometimes, like what would make me happy would be knowing that I left a mark behind that would outlast my mortal self.<p><i>But this article hits close to home, as does your comment, and there's not a day that goes by that I wish I was getting paid to work on open source software full time.</i><p>Yeah, that's another reason I do find a sense of purpose in this Fogbeam Labs thing.  One of our goals is to provide a home for people like you (and me, and many others) who want to work on OSS stuff, but want to get paid as well.  Basically, one big reason I want to create a company, is because the ""company I would want to work for"" doesn't exist, so I figure I'll just create it myself.  If we succeed, I'd love to one day have Fogbeam Labs known as ""a great home for hackers"". I'm convinced we'll get there, but man, is it a lot of work! :-)<p><i>Volunteering in other ways can help; while the effects aren't as long lasting or deep (but subtle), the instant gratification of helping to save a life can be surprisingly uplifting</i><p>There's a lot to be said for various kinds of volunteering.  In my case, I spent about a decade as a volunteer firefighter.  That was a wild experience in so many more ways than I could ever tell.  Some good, some bad, but at least all during that time I always knew I was doing <i>something</i> to really contribute to the world.  Now, I never literally pulled somebody out of a burning building seconds before it collapsed, or any story-book stuff.  But we responded to a few fires, make interior attacks, and knocked down the fire at an early enough stage to save the home, on a few occasions.  So, I can take heart in knowing that, somewhere out there, are a handful of people who didn't have to go through digging through the remnants of a burnt home, and rebuilding from scratch, etc., and that I played a role in that.  To this day, I probably still look back on some of those experiences as the most meaningful ones I've had in my life.",1364938347

5482229,comment,5475614,5476105,1,0,dalke,,,"Because of the discussions during the last couple of weeks, I've learned a lot about Title VII protections for the workplace. I wish we would look towards Title VII for guidance, because many of these nuances have been fleshed out by case law and the EEOC.<p>The courts (in my novice understanding) only look towards behavior which is discriminatory, and there's a set of guidelines to consider. A discussion about apps and websites for sexual health aren't discriminatory towards a protected class of people, even if there are jokes involved. This is how family planning center can have conversations about birth control while also being under Title VII law. There are also some ""bona fide occupational qualification"" exceptions, like not needing to use men as a Playboy Bunny.<p>Sexist imagery would fall under sexual harassment because it may be found to create an atmosphere in which women are viewed as mens sexual playthings rather than as their equal coworkers, quoting from Barbetta v. Chemlawn Services Corp. A defense that an organization can do, to say that it is not discriminatory, is to prevent sexist imagery from being displayed.<p>However, sexual imagery which does not portray coworkers as unequal wouldn't count. This would of course depend on the larger context. Covering a wall with pictures of anatomically correct genitalia, and with no work meaning, is of course different than using pictures of genitalia to show how an STD progresses while at a medical conference. The courts say there isn't a single guideline but rather a ""constellation"" of factors. Still, they say that it's usually not that hard to figure out.<p>However, this code of conduct doesn't look towards the previous history in order to explain itself. Even the phrase ""code of conduct"" is different than Title VII, which is an anti-discrimination policy and explicitly not a code of civility.<p>I've been thinking about the difference this way: two people can have a conversation which is uncivil but calm; perhaps talking about each others' atrocious coding practices, or deriding the bad leadership practices of their shared company.  These can be impolite, but not unwanted by the two participants. In that case, I don't think there should be cause for a third-party who overhears the conversation to intervene and say that they aren't being nice, either to each other or to their non-present boss. While an anti-discrimination statement gives that right to third-party people, should there be racist, sexist, or other discriminatory action or speech.",1364938127

I live in north Oakland, in a pat of the city where a lot of the Black Panthers were based and got involved in community development on a practical level, such as installing traffic lights on dangerous intersections and suchlike. A few of these projects have little signs attached for historical reference. None of them are written in AAVE though.<p>I find slangs, dialects, creole, pidgin etc., quite interesting; I grew up in Ireland with a huge number of local words mixed in with conventional English, my in-laws have a fairly fluid mix of Vietnamese, Chinese and English going on at home, and I had some acting training growing up so I have a very good ear accents and idiom, and can get myself mistaken for a native speaker in several languages with only a very limited vocabulary. I'm all for recognizing what's interesting about AAVE.<p>On the other hand, if you're not teaching English effectively (and effective teaching has been a problem in Oakland, in multiple subjects), then you're putting the pupils at a huge disadvantage.

      return _.map(list, get(propertyName));
    };
</code></pre>
to:<p><pre><code>    var pluck = compose(splat, get);

So yes, for that one line you should use map, but when making things out of the mapping construct, it is sometimes handy to use splat.<p>Other folks have introduced the idea that splat is really nothing more than flip(curry(map)).

It's a trial-and-error system that can produce more durable life-forms by killing off many of the less-durable versions.<p>Humans have already stepped outside the boundaries of natural evolution. We make casts and hardware for broken limbs; form societies and specialized communities; use drugs to resolve medical issues in individuals that evolution would've killed off. Although as a species we probably rose to dominance by being long-distance runners, most of us can't run a marathon today, because we no longer need to.<p>Likewise, evolution didn't make humans naturally better at living in cubicles focusing on a tiny device for many hours a day over the course of the last 50 years. The natural wiring for human neurology is still geared towards being aware of our environment, distracted by sounds and sights and things going on, because that's how you survive sneak attacks from predators or spot camouflaged prey.<p>It's smart to be skeptical of anything claiming to be a miracle cure, but not on the basis of some kind of spooky evolutionary action. Rather, we haven't <i>yet</i> gotten a great track record of coming up with chemicals that can do only one thing to our brains without upsetting some other aspect of our neurochemistry, and that's largely because the brain is wickedly complex and only recently are we starting to make some progress in understanding how it works. I have no doubt that one day we'll be able to fine-tune our own neurochemistry with few side-effects, but today might not be that day.",1364936541

They don't deride people who speak them as poor or less educated.<p>For example consider Japan. Nearly every region in Japan has its own dialect. Everyone learns, for lack of a better way to say it, ""standard Japanese"" which is the kind used by news broadcasters. But, to their friends and family in their hometown they speak their local dialect which is often not understandable by people outside their region.<p>They know when to speak standard Japanese (for example a job interview) and when it's okay to speak the dialect.<p>The article is suggesting that AAVE should be considered a dialect and treated the same way. That seems reasonable to me given it's the same in many other countries. It also means respect for the culture of AAVE instead of contempt which seems like a good thing to me. So many people speak it. Why is their culture any less valid than another?",1364936509

5482051,comment,5480984,5481760,1,0,topherreynoso,,,"I think we need to determine what free will is first because to me random or just unpredictable does not equal free will (that's how I think of the buffer overflow you describe). Nor does complete freedom to act or do whatever you want equal free will. For example, having free will doesn't mean I can now fly or defy other natural laws. Free will, to me, incorporates interpretation and response, and the ability to change the rules regarding interpretation and response. It doesn't mean not having rules and laws regulating interpretation and response, it just means having the ability to redefine those laws. So yes, at some point I'll need something above causal reaction in order to have free will but that doesn't automatically imply that I'm boxed out because that free will is attributed to matter (strange as that matter may be). The whole point of the comparison to strange matter isn't that free will is a particle, but rather a way to show that physical laws don't clearly attach to everything in the universe. And I don't mean to imply that free will must be one thing or another. I think that's what I'm taking issue with in your argument. Especially your last sentence in the above comment. My comparison to strange matter is merely to show that free will cannot be discounted by physical laws. Your assertion says that free will, if existent, must be in a particular form. While my position can't be disproved, yours can't be proven. So I guess neither of us are pushing this argument much of anywhere.",1364936401

One of the strengthes of python is that if you have a copy of Stevens you can usually work out how to do something in Python. And this is awesome. I've written things on top of unix that in times past would have been written in C. However, that mechanism is usually not very ""pythonic"".<p>In the early days python had a principle that there should be one way to do things. You don't hear this so much any more: we're long past that now, with some things different between 2.6 and 2.7 (arg handling), and with multiple broken libraries in the stdlib. When you're working on your own computer and your own time with root access you can always hand-roll outcmes. But it's common to have to deal with a spread of python's and cater to the most obsolete version. Yet I suspect some people still aspire to the one-way-to-do-it, and pretend it's true.<p>I think we should dump the principle.<p>A good example of why compromise is not the right outcome is the curses library - it's not quite Stevens, but it's not friendly either. It's hard to do good work with the curses library. We'd be better off if there was (1) a close curses mapping to the C ncurses mechanisms and (2) a nice-to-use abstraction layer that hid far more away from you.",1325677888

However, it doesn't make sense to have a IMouseClick interface that has only one method, right? That would seem too wasteful.<p>So the natural thing to do is to group all the mouse events into a single interface.<p>Before you know it, you have the abomination of MouseClickListeners, MouseAdapters, and anonymous classes.<p>About overusing patterns - GOF is really a book of anti patterns that is particularly useful for language designers, because it points out the glaring contortions that people have to do to get their work done.<p>On the other hand, being a good programmer requires learning <i>and</i> subsequent unlearning of GOF patterns. I'm reminded of Bruce Lee when he started with Wing Chun, but then found the ""form"" too rigid.

To have no form was to transcend form from a \n    position of mastery that enabled one to see when the\n    rules could be-in fact, needed to be-broken. No form \n    was highly disciplined in its execution. In essence, \n    to have no form was to have access to all forms; to\n    understand all forms at their most essential level\n    and to see and be able to act on the connections among\n    forms. On the other hand, ""having no form"" implied an \n    undisciplined approach, an inability to master any form.\n\n    Lee discovered that he could not teach no form directly \n    to novices in the martial arts. A student first had to \n    master the form of karate, tae kwon do, or some other \n    school; only from a position of mastery could the \n    student begin to experiment with abandoning the form.</code></pre>",1325676866

You seem to presume that good C programmers can be confident that their short, simple C programs are correct.  The anecdotal figure I follow for error incidence is an error per 1000 lines of code, for code written by and check by professional programmers.  In this 600 loc program, that's over a 50% chance of error at the end of the auditing process; the authors are worried about security, which makes looking for alternative sources of reassurance make sense.<p>2. Being comfortable coding in two languages doesn't mean that the set of problem-solving idioms you have for the two languages are equivalent.  IO code in Haskell is indubitably more complex than in C, and has some particularly sharp edges, but the price tag in terms of code complexity does not map into a similar price tag in terms of code-comprehension complexity: the complexity arises from disciplines that, when married to the use of good IO idioms, make it easier to reason about the code.<p>3. <i>Reading the code from the article, the Haskell code is much better written than the C code</i> -- This does suggest that the author is right to use Haskell in cases where you would use C, since you have different skill sets.",1325676116

3423667,story,,,10,29,throwfrustrated,"Ask HN: Frustrated with my co-founder. Any advice?",,"Hello everyone,<p>I wanted to share the situation that I currently am with my co-founder and ask for some advice, and maybe even get it from people who've been in similar situations.<p>In the beginning, him and I were co-workers (both web developers) and really good friends. One day we decided to start some project together, and shortly after that he proposed we do something he'd been wanting to do for a long time. After quickly evaluating the feasibility of the idea and the current competition in the market, I agreed we should do that instead. I wasn't part of the target market for it, but he was, and knew plenty of people who were, too. After a few months of struggling to make decent progress on our free time, I decided I was gonna start working part time, and spending the other half of the day on the startup. I had a lower cost of living and I could do it, and I've always been more risk averse. He needed his full salary and couldn't do it, but appreciated my gesture. He asked me if I wanted more equity for it (the deal was 50/50), and I said 'no'. I know. BIG, rookie mistake. I thought we'd be making a living out of it in a few months, and didn't mind working a bit more and earning less for that long.<p>Well, after six months of me working part time (during which, his job was basically to give his opinion on look&feel, features, etc), we launched, and since then he also took responsability for system administration tasks, since he knows about that and I don't. Our startup has quite a lot of traffic, so its sysadmin necessities are a bit high, but definitely not even a part time job. I'd say now, two years after launch with +20M pageviews a month, it's about 5 hours a week on average. Some weeks a lot more, others nothing at all.<p>Two monhs after launch, I decided to quit my job and work full time on the startup. I had a side passive income business that gave me enough to live by, and to be honest I was only excited to work on this, and not my job anymore. It took us an extra year from this point to make any revenue for the business, so for another year I was working full time, while he did the occasional (but important, none the less) sysadmin tasks. Also, he'd convince his friends, who were target market, to become users. It's true, we wouldn't have been able to grow our user base without his connections (or it would have been a lot more difficult), but it's not like he had to convince each one by one or anything. Our users are already using competition services, so it's a matter of knowing them (check) and sending invitations with some custom message on his behalf. From there, it grew pretty much on its own. He also dealt with a friend of his who's a jackass, but a partner who brought an important number of users in the beginning.<p>So one year after we launch, we start getting revenue. In 2-3 months, it's the same that he's making at his day job (which is a good salary), and increasing every month. 3-4 months after that, it's already 30-50% more than he makes. And here we are, about 10 months after starting being profitable, and he's still raking in his average 5 hours a week on sysadmin stuff, still no word on when (if ever!) he's gonna quit his job to work full time on the startup. To be honest, I am very disappointed in his behavior and commitment, and I don't think he deserves the 50% share of the company he has. Not to mention the fact that he's just a reactive person (something breaks? we fix it. customers complain? we address it.), but nothing really ""creative"" comes out of him: let's do this, even if noone asks for it; let's try improving this metric; let's aim for higher revenue; etc. Long story short: for the last year and a half, I've been the one who's been running the business, while he's the sysadmin guy who for some reason, I have to check with first before doing anything major, and who also takes 50% of profits.<p>For a while I tried to just think of him as some early investor that was lucky to get into the deal, but it's just there in my head all the time. The unfairness of it all, and it's really affecting my ability to focus on the business. I'm constantly thinking of new ideas and projects (even spending time on some of them), even when I know there are just a shot, and I already have a great, profitable business in my hands. Only because I wouldn't have him in those businesses.<p>I'm sure most of you will be thinking of ""well, just talk to him and ask for more equity!"" The thing is, we've had difficult conversations before, and they didn't go well. For example, in the beginning we said (yes, nothing on paper or concrete, again, rookie mistake) that I'd get some compensation for my extra time spent (part time, then full time) on the startup once we were profitable. Once that time came, the conversation was more like ""well, nobody told you to do it, you did it because you wanted to!"", so the compensation he thought was fair was ridiculous to me (like a two month salary, for a year full time and half a year part time).<p>Also, I'm sure he'd be quite on defensive if I brought this up. ""You're trying to take what's mine!"". Keep in mind he's the one who's part of the target market, so he feels very emotionally attached to the business, a part of it, after so long. And on top of that, he's in quite a bad personal situation right now, and it's gonna last at least a few months, so even more of a reason to take it badly.<p>Any advice on what to do? Has anyone been here before?<p>P.S. I'm using a throwaway account because I don't want this whole drama to be traceable to my startup, sorry.<p>EDIT: I guess I should've answered as well ""What would make me happy? What's the ideal outcome?"". Well, talking to him and him accepting to lower his equity significantly would be the ideal outcome. 25/75 would be ideal, 40/60 would be OK as well. I guess what I'm afraid is having the conversation, not getting to any agreement but instead worsening the situation with him. We went to such a phase before, and it wasn't pretty (and I was totally unproductive).",1325675986

Whenever someone creates a closed, proprietary product and wants to restrict uses of it, he is directly harming the open world too, by drawing away resources from the creation of an eco system and net effects around the open product to the closed product.<p>Also, assuming a person places some value X to openness, if the closed product is created and adds value Y to that particular person, and Y>X, it's effectively encouraging a closed world.<p>I think the single greatest thing we're losing on is derivative works. We live in a world with almost no derivative works, because of closed creations. For that I partially blame the closed content authors and really wish they had created less of it.<p>If you share these beliefs, it's easy to reach the conclusion that piracy is better than purchasing and encouraging these closed works.  Of course it is better to avoid using it altogether (to avoid creating net effects around it), but if you are going to use something, it is better to pirate it than to purchase it legally.",1325675397

It's a fun way to weed out 1-bit people from the population: <a href=""http://www.xach.com/naggum/articles/3225130472400367@naggum.net.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xach.com/naggum/articles/3225130472400367@naggum....</a> Furthermore Common Lisp is a Lisp-2 whereas Scheme is a Lisp-1. (Aesthetically I prefer Scheme.) So really there are several working meanings at play when people say ""Lisp"", this is frustrating for 1-bit people.<p>My usual heuristic in using context clues to determine which meaning is meant: if there is no qualifier for a particular family member of Lisp, I assume something is talking about the Lisp family, unless accompanied by a code example, in which case it's probably Common Lisp. When I see someone type ""LISP"" I usually think ""This person doesn't know Lisp"", just like how you'll sometimes see people type FORTH or PERL when talking about those languages. But that's not always the case so it's useful to double-check before calling them out, especially if they give code examples. (They may just be old after all. ;) )",1325675395

It can only be escalated to a PayPal decision after communications between the buyer and the seller have proved unsuccessful / broken down, as in the seller doesn't reply, or refuses to sort out the situation. It doesn't happen overnight.<p>It's not clear which way this went, but after negotiating with the seller proved fruitless, and then being forced into raising a PayPal dispute, then again the seller failing to resolve the matter forcing an escalation to a PayPal decision - this led to the path of destroying what was claimed to be counterfeit materials.<p>So the seller knows that violin labels are a contentious area, thus perhaps should have been more accommodating and resolved the issue without forcing the buyer to escalate.<p>From the buyers perspective, being asked to destroy an item they claim is counterfeit as a pre-requisite to getting his money back seems a rather straightforward step.<p>Clearly the buyer and seller disagree with the authenticity of the item - but that should have spurred the seller to remedy the situation rather than force an escalation to a PayPal dispute. That way the seller wouldn't have lost out.<p>The seller's failure to resolve the situation appropriately, before the buyer felt it necessary to escalate a Paypal dispute is part of the problem here. I guess the seller was playing hardball instead of negotiating in good faith. And by playing hardball and failing to resolve the problem initially, the seller loses.<p>Where the seller believes that they sold an authentic item, and the buyer disagrees, isn't it logical for the seller to offer a good faith refund and send-back without forcing the buyer to raise a paypal dispute and then escalate it when  no resolution could be made?",1325674983

1741182,comment,1736779,1737382,0,0,1va,,,"You make this general point (correct me if I'm wrong, but I think your argument is that feminists care more about equality at the top end of the scale than the bottom) a couple of times in this thread.  I'm not quite sure what you are trying to say.<p>If you mean that feminists don't pursue discrimination cases when it comes to low-pay/low-prestige/high-risk jobs, that's demonstrably false: There are many examples of ""women's lib"" folks organizing factories or migrant workers or whatever.  Many of the related Supreme Court cases (e.g. Ledbetter, Chrapliwy) were about discrimination in blue collar jobs at factories. It is likely that these groups spend more time and money pursuing discrimination issues in blue-collar and low-wage workplaces than they do in the higher-salary, higher-prestige jobs, not least of which because (a) discrimination is probably more blatant and common there and (b) more people, men and women both, have below average (arithmetic mean) incomes than have above average salaries and (c) more women have low-pay, low-prestige jobs than men.<p>If you mean that feminists hold up the gender imbalance in high-wage, high-prestige jobs when advocating for their cause, of course they do.  Everyone would.  What middle class donor is going to pull out their wallet to ensure their daughters can get janitorial jobs?  The aspirational jobs are simply more inspiring.  Moreover, ensuring a gender balance in the lowest-wage, lowest-prestige job categories while leaving the top end alone isn't really achieving equality, is it?<p>By the way, I don't think your notion that women are under-represented in low pay/low prestige jobs holds up to scrutiny anyway.  Women are over-represented in the lowest end of the scale, and under-represented in the highest end of the scale. Take a look at BLS or Census Bureau data on the highest and lowest paying jobs and the distribution of women and men in each. Here's an interesting table of unemployment rate by occupation and sex: <a href=""http://www.infoplease.com/business/employment-rate-occupation-2008-2009.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoplease.com/business/employment-rate-occupatio...</a>.  Note that the unemployment rate pretty closely correlates to what you'd expect from a gender bias: the unemployment rate in traditionally feminine occupations is higher for men than for women, the unemployment rate in traditionally masculine occupations is higher for women than for men.<p>I think the only claim in your line of thinking that holds up to the least bit of scrutiny is that men are over-represented in dangerous job categories, or more to the point that men account for a disproportionate share of workplace fatalities.  This is true (although your numbers are a bit off). The breakdown of hours worked by sex is around 55% men to 45% women.  The breakdown of fatal injuries is around 93% men and 7% women.  But with only 4,300 workplace fatalities in the United States in 2009, we're talking about one fatality for every 59 <i>million</i> hours worked. Workplace fatalities are not the biggest labor problem in the US, probably not even for the most dangerous occupations.<p>I don't mean to flog this thread that is fairly dead at this point, but seriously, the level of largely unchallenged inaccuracy, ""truthiness"", and borderline misogyny in this thread is not only well below HN's typical level of quality, but frankly it is disturbing. This conversation needs some balance.<p>The parent comment here currently has 15 upvotes.  Another comment on this page claiming there hasn't been gender based discrimination ""for a very long time"" has 3 upvotes. Many of the claims made in these posts are simply demonstrably false.  They seem to represent some kind of knee-jerk, well, not misogyny, but something approaching it.  Is there a term for ""dislike of women"" in place of ""hatred of women""?<p>I'm male, but gender inequality and discrimination in the workplace is obvious to me, let alone to the women in my life.  Gender isn't the dominant factor in predicting income, rank or career success. It may not even be among the top few factors.  But it is certainly a factor, and not a negligible one at that. To be candid I'm both astounded and troubled this isn't obvious to more of the participants in this conversation.",1285794975

Excite had some rules about ranking search results that actively penalized pages with relevant content compiled by page authors who weren't spamming. And despite efforts not to be subject to spamming (Excite was not the <i>worst</i> available choice at the time, and was once one of my top-three search engines), Excite could be fooled by spammers. As soon as Google came on the scene, a lot of serious researchers rapidly abandoned Excite, and Excite certainly suffered from a precipitous drop-off in favorable word of mouth from general consumers once Google was on the scene.",1285794603

Yes, maybe a freshman could struggle through it, but freshman need to be in a hurry to get to the 'good stuff' and have better things to do.<p>Students, be warned:  I know all the material there much deeper than there and have done applications to military and commercial problems and have published peer-reviewed work in applied math, mathematical statistics, and artificial intelligence, and I don't think that book is worth your time or effort -- you need better material.<p>The quality level is just too low:<p>A quality problem in the book is a lack of emphasis on proofs which are the main means we have to get new results we know are correct and know that long before some rack of computers has served one million unique users a day.<p>The math background in Knuth 'The Art of Computer Programming' is done with much higher quality.<p>Of course, measure theory, say, from Papa Rudin, is the way to do probability, but it is not done that way often enough in the US:  Nearly the only people who take Papa Rudin are pure math grad students, and pure math in the US doesn't much like the applications to probability.<p>Still, it is quite possible to give a MUCH better treatment of probability with just calculus plus, say, a few theorems about calculus, e.g., about improper integrals and interchange of order of integration, usually not covered in undergrad calculus.<p>Yes, conditioning is a big deal, should be covered, and is touched on in the book.  But more is needed in conditioning.  Then the classic limit theorems should be covered -- at least the weak law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.<p>For computer science, it would be super nice to cover Poisson processes and the renewal theorem since operational networks and server farms are awash in these processes.<p>There are plenty of good books on probability without measure theory although I am not a fan of Feller I because it is too difficult to see the forest for the trees and too easy for an unguided tour to get lost.",1285794421

Write once, slice and dice data many times.<p>For the record, I do know of many products that do the same thing, but they are inadequate for different reasons. Pure managed code is one thing, price is a huge problem with a lot of them, lack of easy managed programmability, or just plain slow. A b-tree index cannot compete with bitmap index when we talk about intersection and aggregations on millions of records. And yes, I do know about SQL Server Analysis Services, PowerPivot, SPSS, and all the big ones.<p>But the MDX is not very intuitive, and SQL does not gives me the fine granularity to intermediate results that I need (I mean, yes it can be done, but a price is paid in performance). So I am into creating a more granular DSL.<p>From .net I am looking into 2 options: \n* A .net API. probably some type of fluent interface\n* A text DSL that the developer executes against the engine. Maybe a graphic front end on top of it.<p>If you had to write an application that queries this kind of engine, what would you prefer?

The exchange rate on MtGox took a dip from $930 to $760 between yesterday and now but on other exchanges like Bitstamp it may have gone from $790 to $750.<p>The rate on MtGox was higher than on other exchanges because it was hard to get cash out of MtGox. Hence if you had money on it, the easy way to get it out was to buy bitcoins, transfer them to another wallet and sell them on a more liquid exchange like Bitstamp or btc-e where USD withdrawals are quick. This created too much buy pressure on MtGox and this pressure faded when they made it hard to even withdraw bitcoins. That explains the crash on MtGox but its amplitude was nowhere as large as on other exchanges who by the way handle larger transaction volumes now.",1391799493

I hadn&#x27;t, but from his description, it was probably the camera of a guy I flew a two-seater with in a competition a year earlier.<p>Turns out that the camera had been returned by a hiker who found it while hiking on a mountain, approximately 10 kilometers from the airfield. Looking at the last footage in the camera, you could see three guys using a suction cup holder to attach the camera on the outside body of the glider. The video continued as the glider launched, and for approximately ten minutes of flight. Then, the camera detatched from the airplane. As it went tumbling down, there were a couple of frames where the glider was captured from below, rapidly disappearing into the sky.<p>The camera landed on the mountain, where it remained through the winter. A year later, a guy hiking there found it and returned it, in working order, to the glider club.",1391799321

To simplify and streamline logistics, our business is modeled more closely to the milkman than the pizza delivery man. On Sunday, we send out a picture message with one bread choice for each day of the coming week. If you want any of them, you reply via SMS and we bring it to your doorstep.<p>Since our drivers can make one pickup and then drop off identical products to every customer, delivery becomes far simpler and cheaper.<p>Lots of smart folks are vying for the one-stop grocery delivery market, and we think it will become a war of logistics for who wins that massive market (personally, I&#x27;m pulling for Instacart). We&#x27;re approaching a different and smaller (but still quite large) market, from a different angle.<p>Fresh bread is our first product because it&#x27;s almost universally loved, and it arguably decreases in quality every hour after being baked. Eventually we hope to expand to still-simple, curated line-up of high quality, short shelf-life specialty foods (coffee, cheese, etc.)<p>Sign up if you&#x27;re interested, but more importantly, leave us some feedback here. :)",1391798788

What you learn is that defining merit in any complex system is often as difficult as actually achieving it. If the fitness landscape is non computable then defining merit globally <i>IS</i> precisely as difficult as achieving it. The two reduce to the same problem!<p>... and of course any real world problem domain that is worth doing and profitable to solve is almost definitely non computable, complex, shifting, chaotic, all those nasty things ...<p>Moreover, if you define merit via any &quot;merit function&quot; that does not properly model your problem domain then the system will optimize to your merit definition rather than for actual merit. I watched this happen over and over again with genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and other learning algorithms. Sometimes it&#x27;s comical... I watched a damn genetic programming system evolve to predict the behavior of my operating system&#x27;s kernel thread scheduler to predict whether they would receive an &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; category item (I had a multithreaded fitness function) instead of classifying the item for example. Nature always prefers the lowest-complexity solution for fundamental second law of thermodynamics type reasons.<p>I think this is why things like stack ranking, etc., result in superficial short-term improvements to company performance followed by long-term collapses in creativity and deep performance over ensuing years. When you implement stack ranking then your company&#x27;s culture optimizes itself for stack ranking, not for the market. Stack ranking captures a small aspect of the overall fitness function of the market -- namely tenacity and work ethic -- but fails to capture anything more than that.

Now the pawn shop is out the money and owns a useless piece of metal and plastic.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this problem with phones, tablets, and even tasers. The company will not activate them if they&#x27;ve been reported lost or stolen. But &quot;finders-keepers&quot; is legal and people can lie about theft. Of course the company also has a second interest not to help create a used market. Just like encrypted firmware schemes, this erodes personal control over our property. The legal owner with physical control should be able to use the device. Period.<p>There are also concerns over government or corporate disablement. Aside from obvious government malice during e.g. protests, does anyone really think either the government or the phone company can run a blacklist without false positives? Obviously not. Nobody can when your population size is >300 million. And the customer service grunt is just following the rules when your device is disabled and he cannot re-enable it.<p>The argument for this law is that it will reduce thefts by making the phones worthless. I understand this. I just don&#x27;t think that is worth losing control over our property and devices.",1391797699

The purpose of government is to preserve your freedom to do something. If some users want something and cannot arrange it themselves, then they may just not be able to get it. It is not the government&#x27;s place to mandate that everyone gets what some people want. That goes against personal freedom. It is certainly the government&#x27;s place to punish thiefs---a person who deprives another of their freedom to control their property. The government should not mandate certain ways of arranging private (between a person and the phone company) affairs.",1391796425

Sometimes I&#x27;m just relating an anecdote, there is no overall problem, I don&#x27;t need 3 suggestions on what to do next. The next is already solved. You just haven&#x27;t let me finish the story.<p>This is possibly not related but the article says to speak from experience. Can this be applied to job interviews? In previous interviews I&#x27;ve started with my experience stating what I&#x27;ve done in the past only to be interrupted and told they don&#x27;t care about what I&#x27;ve done in the past, how would I do it in the future. When I explain my approach to Project Management or QA Testing, or whatever, sometimes I get asked if that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve done things in the past and when I say yes the interview is very short.<p>Maybe that second paragraph is how I phrase things, but if you&#x27;ve got experience in a subject matter you&#x27;re going to base what you would do, on what your experience has taught you.<p>Sometimes it sounds like people want a completely new process that&#x27;s never been done before, or at least isn&#x27;t attributed to some other company having done.",1391796372

6621950,comment,6621693,6621693,2,0,VLM,,,"Another interesting problem is QR codes are not human readable and are almost exclusively used by advertisers.  So there is a reluctance to scanning a QR code.  I am fairly certain that this will eventually mostly be used for advertising, $1000 for a headstone without a QR code or $900 for a headstone 90% of the surface covered by a QR code linking to a targeted offer.  You could argue that historically gravestones have been used for advertising, just rather low key like a small amount of religious or occasionally political commentary / quote.<p>This will of course be followed up by interesting defacement reports, see you chip away here and sharpie marker there and next thing you know this gravestone points to some shock site; goatse perhaps or more appropriately given the deceased maybe a gore-site.",1382882288

Typically it&#x27;s only really used if you&#x27;re doing something tricky that actually depends on the semantics of predecrementing, usually in an array reference of the x[--i] variety. It&#x27;s idiomatic in C++ I&#x27;d guess because of operator overloading: postdecrement/postincrement may produce large unused object copies that not all compilers will optimize away, so using the pre- versions by default has become idiomatic in that community.",1382882114

The C-- team&#x27;s hypothesis was that some kinds of languages (especially functional languages) would benefit from a cross-platform layer that is a better compilation target than C, partly through being a bit more low-level. The previous two popular routes were native-code compilers and compile-via-C compilers. Native-code compilers have the disadvantage that porting them and maintaining them on N architectures is significant work, and compile-via-C compilers have the disadvantage that C isn&#x27;t a very convenient compilation target for many language features, especially to efficiently compile some common FP language features. The hope was that C-- would be a nice middle ground between compiling via C and compiling to native code, producing a target that was nicer than C as a target.<p>Imo, that hypothesis did have some legs, but people are now instead usually using LLVM in various ways to accomplish it.

6621895,comment,6619968,6620605,1,0,crusso,,,"<i>the way cancer medicine is done today is a lot of guess work and experimentation</i><p>On top of the things you point out, cancer is all about the genes - the genes in the host as well as the myriad of mutations in the cancer.<p>Cancer treatment of the future will involve sequencing of the patient&#x27;s genome and repeated sequencing of samples of the cancer itself.  The computer will be needed to dynamically account for mutations and prescribe treatment for each one as it arises.  Networks of medical computer systems will be able to consult at internet speeds on specific mutations to get suggestions for treatment that are built upon results of other computer prescriptions whose efficacy is much better recorded, processed, and correlated.<p>As you say, it will be the second tier of the medical industry that most benefits from this revolution.  Any nurse who can follow the instructions given by the computer for gathering information, administering tests, feeding results back to the computer, and providing treatment could become a world class oncologist.<p>Probably doctors will still play a role in some level of oversight of what the computers are prescribing -- but that will fade as our trust level increases over time.  Within ten years, computers will be assisting doctors on every diagnosis.  Within twenty, they&#x27;ll be assisting nurses, mostly replacing the need for doctor time.  Within thirty years, you&#x27;ll be able to perform your own interactions with a medical computer as easily as you Google today -- probably easier since it will interact with you using natural language.",1382881126

1810406,comment,1803351,1803904,0,0,middayc,,,"I am amazed that people say Lisp is about macros. I think it's about being homoiconic. You can make some ugly form of macros in ANY language. <i>Homoiconic</i>-ness is what makes you want to make macros with Lisp. But it is much more than just about macros. Language REBOL is for example fully homoiconic.<p><pre><code>  >> a: [ 300 3 ]
  >> insert a 'add
  >> probe a
  [ add 1 2 ]
  >> print first a
  add
  >> do first a 100 1
  == 101
  >> do a
  == 303
  >> f: func [] a
  >> f
  == 3
  >> change second :f 'subtract
  >> f
  == 297
</code></pre>
all code is data (blocks of words and values).<p>From * Io * example below I would say it's a little different. It's more like it has a runtime api to change/generate it's runtime. I think SmallTalk has something similar to this.<p>* Factor * has compile time macros. At runtime it has quotations, which are blocks of code (separate from it's other data strucures I think, but don't shoot me if I'm wrong) that can be modified and executed by your code with few specific words like <i>curry</i> and <i>compose</i>. This means you have a little less freedom than in rebol where block of code is in no way different than a block of data. What is awesome about factor is that it also compiles quotations at runtime.<p>Otherwise Factor is very very cool, and I envy some runtime features of Io a lot.<p>And Python has as little to do with lisp as Visual Basic. Python is the world's best dynamic <i>Imperative</i> lang IMHO :)",1287561126

How does the whole AppStore policy make iOS more integrated?<p>When I am criticizing Apple for iOS not being open I mean it is not open to run any application that works on the device.<p>The Problem with iOS is that only Apple-Signed applications are allowed. Because of that, Apple has the power to keep the competition and the content they do not approve of out.",1287558821

I have many, many friends who are unemployed artists or are business types working less than full-time who would kill for a decent full-time position.<p>That said, I <i>cannot</i> understand how a young, motivated programmer has trouble finding a job. The company I work for in Denver has been looking for Ruby and front-end web developers of all levels, and from all over the country, for months.<p>First priority: make writing code a lifestyle choice. Need a better resume? Write some code -- anything -- and put it on Github. Bored? Write some code and put it on Github. Sick of sending out resumes? Write some code and... you get the idea. Strong candidates love the craft, not just the paycheck. Show pride in your code and prove you'll want to write code at work and at home.<p>Programmers who work at companies that you should actually want to work for are not hired because they have great resumes or went to great colleges. They are hired because they are capable of solving real problems while writing maintainable code. If you can do that, you're an easy hire.<p>This goes for anyone. Want a serious, no-bullshit interview for a job in beautiful Denver (we can help relocate) with fantastic benefits and doing work for amazing clients? Write some decent code (Ruby or Javascript), put it on Github, and comment with a link.",1287558707

1810338,comment,1803351,1803351,0,0,fdr,,,"I used to write a reasonable amount of Lisp at my first job, in an industrial research lab, in addition to a fond exposure to it at my institution of higher learning.<p>I really, really like Lisp. The syntax, as a result of it having been introduced to me fairly early, never was a hangup of any kind. SLIME is quite wonderful. I always yearn for quasiquotation.<p>However, I cannot justify using it for a small-scale project that has to ship relatively soon with limited resources. The reason: Python has useful projects with good release culture and documentation that are not seen in the Lisp world, if only for the lack of contributors. (Considering the number of authors, I found common lisp documentation to be quite good, in fact, but I still find them pretty hard pressed to compete with, say, the Django manual, or most of the Python standard library itself)<p>Software — especially at the small, early stage scale —  is still loaded with problems that are not matters of extensive, inspired, and unique programming. Or, they could be, but did you really want to write your own whiz-bang form validation instead of building all the other features of your product?<p>Clojure I think represents a very interesting escape from this trap, and if I had a lot of Java dependencies (whether bequeathed or because of unique library advantages Java may have. WEKA comes to mind for some things) I would most certainly want to use it. But in a project I control from the beginning, Python wins, hands down, in a number of domains.<p>I will also expose one heretical opinion of mine about Lisp Macros: they're great, but easy to overuse, and seldom So Necessary if one makes good use of higher order functions. Some code, admittedly, comes out nicer using macros, but I can almost always get the expressive power I need with little contortion using higher order functions.<p>If I had the time to follow my heart, I'd want to do something to continue to vitalize Lisp. But not while I need to ship.<p>To round out this post, here are some minor peeves on the Python side though:<p>* No symbol data type. I don't like using strings for these. I use SymbolType for this, but it's still comparatively clunky compared to CL.<p>* Hyphens are the best intra-token-delimiter (see what I mean?)<p>* No macros<p>* No quasiquotation<p>* Slow<p>* Have to avoid stepping on myself because of the mutable environment frames you see a bit more frequently as opposed to say, Scheme or Erlang where tail recursion is the name of the game. I also make use of ""labels"" in cl.<p>* Did I mention tail recursion elimination? No? Well...sometimes this would be nice.",1287558278

And put the video of me eating it on YouTube.<p>OpenID is just a weak idea that needs a LOT and LOT of pushing to make it accepted. Look at the iPhone - nobody pushes you to use it, you see it, like it and use it.<p>With OpenID people have to be forced to use it, because it's cumbersome and does not offer any clear advantage.<p>Like I've said earlier, the real auth solution is the one where you simply stick your USB stick into a machine, type a 4 letter pin and everything on that machine is authenticated till you take it out.<p>A weak concept pushed by technologists and people who want to give talks and earn money off this technology.",1220356738

292611,comment,291935,292097,0,0,ii,,,"Removing the GIL won't magically solve any problems.<p><i>This has been tried before, with disappointing results, which is why I'm reluctant to put much effort into it myself. In 1999 Greg Stein (with Mark Hammond?) produced a fork of Python (1.5 I believe) that removed the GIL, replacing it with fine-grained locks on all mutable data structures. He also submitted patches that removed many of the reliances on global mutable data structures, which I accepted. However, after benchmarking, it was shown that even on the platform with the fastest locking primitive (Windows at the time) it slowed down single-threaded execution nearly two-fold, meaning that on two CPUs, you could get just a little more work done without the GIL than on a single CPU with the GIL.</i><p><a href=""http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214235"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214235</a>",1220356034

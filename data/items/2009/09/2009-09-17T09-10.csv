This makes contextual sense - C blocks are being stack allocated and have to be explicitly copied to the heap. Java inner instances get copied immediately, because everything lives on the heap in Java.",1253181080

So if I was reading a configuration file I would throw something like ConfigurationReadException and then wrap the IOException in this. Then if I switch to reading the configuration file from a database (for example), I can wrap an SQLException instead of the IOException. Encapsulation isn't broken and I still have checked exceptions.",1253180658

827723,comment,827472,827571,0,0,polvi,,,"Wanted to give an update explaining what happened and how we fixed it.<p>The main issue is that we offer the ability for a user to change their email address. This is a very common feature, and thus something a lot of sites fall victim to. The basic nature of an XSS is that a malicious site can cause you to POST or GET arbitrary URLs. Since cookies are always sent along with the request, if you are authenticated, the attacking site can cause you to hit traditionally protected URLs. This is normally a non-issue, as only your browser reads the content -- the attacking site has no visibility into the data. However, it is an issue when there are side-effects, when the malicious site can change things to their advantage. In this case, they changed the email address to their own via a post. From there, all they had to do was hit the password reset function for their email address.<p>As soon as we found out about this, we immediately turned off email and password reset. This prevented the XSS from working, as the urls in the attack 404'd. This was a temporary solution.<p>Next, we now require you to enter your current password when you reset your email. This would also prevent the XSS, as the attacker would need to know the users password. It also prevents against other attacks, such as someone with physical access to your logged in session from resetting your email address with out you knowing.<p>We also implemented the Django CSRF middleware. This protects the rest of our forms on the site from similar problems.<p>As for impact, our audit logs show that only the attackers account was compromised for the sake of his demo. Fortunately, he did not randomize the email address used to change the password. If anyone <i>did</i> become a victim to his example, it would not have changed the email to his address (we only allow unique email addresses in the system). However, it is possible this XSS was in ""the wild"" with other addresses, but according to our logs and the nature of the vulnerability, it is highly unlikely that it impacted any users.<p>As others mentioned in the comments, it would have been great for the author to contact us before posting this. As motivation to future security researchers, we will happily offer a bounty if you report your bug to us before posting it publicly. In fact, if you're really good -- we'll happily make the bounty a full time job with benefits! :)<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this issue, please do not hesitate to contact me personally! polvi@cloudkick.com",1253180517
827722,comment,827358,827358,0,0,JulianMorrison,,,"The most important problem with checked exceptions in Java is the way they interact with inheritance. If you could just declare ""throws"" everywhere, you could at least live up to the ideal of knowing the exceptions to expect. But you can't override and add a new ""throws"". Substitution principle, yeah, I know. But why did they design Runnable without ""throws Exception""?",1253180495

This is why the reason I start companies is exactly to free myself from a condition where I'm required to go to work at 8 a.m. with a boss that tells me what to do (possibly not right or interesting for me), and with at max 30 days of holidays in the year, without the ability to do, for instance, much more today, and get a free day tomorrow. This is in my opinion the highest value of creating a startup.<p>It's worth to note that if you are like me high risk startups with VCs in the middle may not be the best idea, but something that is able to be supported by a decent business model ASAP is better.",1253178069

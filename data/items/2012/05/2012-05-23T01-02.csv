4011091,comment,4009999,4009999,2,0,wglb,,,"Couple of interesting things that the article did not describe.  The addresses of instructions in the b5500 were <i>decimal</i>.  Yes, decimal.<p>IBM came out with the IBM 380 model 67 in about 1967 with it's first implementation of virtual memory.  I believe that was done in conjunction with U. Mich.<p>In the 60s there was lots of discussion about virtual memory, what size should the ""working set"" be, and so on.  As for many things in that time and actually decades later, ideas were not accepted until IBM implemented them.  Many folk at the time thought that IBM invented virtual memory.<p>What is missing from most of these discussions is an even more remarkable machine (in my view), the Burroughs B1700.  It did not have a fixed instruction set size--each program had a definition in the header of the file that specified the size of the word, the number of bits in the instruction field, and so on.  In fact, the instruction codes were not fixed, and changed several times.  Only the compiler writer and the firmware engineer had to agree on the meaning of the codes.<p>And yes, I believe that Alan Kay is right about misguided hardware architectures after all these years.  There was lots of disappointment when the 360 instruction set came out when it was compared to the instruction sets that came before it. The instruction set of the DEC-10 and relatives was a thing of beauty.  The PDP-11 was also quite nice, and if you have ever looked at a Motorola 6809, you can see some resemblance.<p>The Intel instruction sets continued this negative trend.  It has always seemed to me that the instructions were designed with an eye to optimizing the wrong thing, and prematurely.<p>What Intel is good at are 1) design wins and 2) fab process improvements.  Instruction set or software design, not so much.<p>We need somebody to turn this cart over and straighten up this mess.",1337737822

Google Calendar should rule this space, and it drives me nuts that deciding to attend an event usually involves multiple rounds of copying/pasting and manual editing when the amount of data involved is so trivial and well-specified.<p>On a broader level, there's a huge disruptive opportunity for a time-based search engine. <i>When</i> things happen is often very, very important, but gathering, collating, and connecting this information is painfully difficult. Take a simple example: Federal Reserve Board meetings. There are of tremendous importance to economic analysts, and worth knowing about for any politically aware person. Here is the calendar page: <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.h...</a> There isn't even an RSS feed. On a more general level, there isn't any obvious tool for browsing recurring events to look at their periodicity. To stick with the economic context (because it's one that matters rather a lot), consider the quarterly earnings and filings of public companies. As someone who likes DSP, it's perplexing to me that I can't add and subtract periodic data about companies' year-on-year performance as I would other sorts of periodic signal to explore the contributing factors.<p>I thought that this is where Google Trends/insights for search would go. Look at this search: <a href=""http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=toys%2C%20mattel%2C%20hasbro&cmpt=q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=toys%2C%20mattel%2C...</a> You can see a big spike in searches for 'toys' at the end of every year, which is obviously related to Christmas. You would think that with so much lovely cyclical data, the obvious thing to do would be treat it as a signal, but no.<p>At first blush, events and trends seem like two different and unrelated things, but it's a fact that almost the entire human race uses the same calendar and clock system, so that both one-off and recurring temporal data both involve fairly straightforward cardinality problems. IT <i>infuriates</i> me that I can search out particular word combinations from billions of documents and get results within a few seconds, but that trying to locate things in time feels like it has hardly advanced at all in over a decade.",1337737669

If you want pixel-perfect equality between all browsers then supporting IE6 is truly a pain.  Why anyone would want pixel-perfect equality is beyond me though because the end-users simply don't care.
The real argument for the stuff I've worked on wasn't IE vs. the rest, it was HTML4-ish (IE 6,7,8) vs HTML5 (IE9, FF, Chrome, Safari, Opera).  Even then using jQuery + Knockout on the client side solved nearly every compatibility problem.
There was also an actual advantage with testing against older versions of IE as it enabled us to identify weird performance and behavioural problems earlier.  When we ignored a given problem in IE6,7,8 during the development phase the same problem would turn up later in all of the other browsers when the system was under load.  Fixing the problem for IE6,7,8 got us a massive jump on fixing the problem for all of the other browsers.
Personally for my own stuff the oldest version of IE I test against now is 8.  The massive number of XP/IE6 users still out there are in China running a hacked version of XP.  As I don't develop for the Chinese market this isn't a problem.",1337737604

I think we are still in the Raft stage of space exploration, although it is a great idea, I think we need to work on those little steps.<p>Getting back to the moon and/or perhaps chasing asteroids seems much more practical at this time I don't think colonisation of mars will ever happen unless we gain the capacity to build bigger ships in orbit of earth, it just costs to much to get things up there.

That's good and keeps conversations and new encounters thrilling.<p>- On a hackerthon you have even stronger hooks because you have to work together or you just <i>have a very good reason</i> to talk to each othermingling will happen automatically and excitement wil be at its max because everything is new (people, context, tech) and you face a challenge which you have to solve in a short time which makes it even more thrilling. The stronger these kind of excitements are the stronger the initial bonding will be  between the participants after the event. And this bonding is everbody's goal: not just meeting random people for coffee but meeting like-minded people <i>in order to</i> build strong relationships with them. Or to put it another way: the context (=> the event/guide/task/excitement) is the actual cause for strong bondings and relationships and <i>not</i> similar personalities or preferred languages. Interactions between people are context and behavior driven and not because of similar profiles.<p>You have to give people a task, a mission. Just telling them to meet and talk will make them feel awkward.",1337737177
4011053,comment,4009519,4010376,4,0,comex,,,"The first thing about L4.verified is that formal verification, while admirable, <i>doesn't really matter</i>, at least not in a world where exploits are commodities, exploitation a continuous process: if a program is only a few thousand lines long and written with attention to security, the number of vulnerabilities can at worst be counted on one hand, and attackers will find them all for you in short order.  If you're Iran and have an attacker capable of pouring millions of dollars into a single hack, it might make a difference; if you're Microsoft, not so much.<p>The second thing is that while a microkernel (if used with an IOMMU to prevent a malicious driver from DMAing all over your code) appealingly prevents an attacker from exploiting a malloc overflow in some random network driver and immediately gaining full access to anything (the current state of kernel security!-- but performance is key), it doesn't prevent an attacker from using that network driver pwn to hijack the user's Facebook session; full access is appealing, but in a complex system there are many, many ""lesser targets"" that are just as bad from a user's point of view.<p>Microkernels and their little cousin sandboxing can help, but the resulting trusted computing base is still much, much larger than we can formally verify in the foreseeable future.<p>(A sibling of this comment mentioned Singularity, but that's a fairly different beast: instead of proving that fast code is safe, you try to make obviously (memory) safe code fast.  The only reason Singularity is able to make interesting performance claims is that it uses verification to completely avoid system calls: pretty cool, but a NaCl-like kernel could do something fairly similar for C; it doesn't really change the correctness/performance tradeoff.)",1337737162

Automated cars are the complete opposite. They can easily be used on our existing infrastructure. If you need to go to a new place, you simply flatten and pave a long rectangle of area that's a couple meters wide. They merely need to be allowed instead of planned for (the problem is small enough and the incentives easily created enough that a corporation can realistically accomplish the necessary R&D and planning). And if they turn out to be a hit, it's relatively easy to just sell more of the automated cars.<p>And let's grant, for a moment, the rosiest projections of California HSR, and it's just a matter of doing it right. It's still a complicated, multidecade-long undertaking: all it takes is a random idiot in Sacramento or DC hellbent on sabotaging the project to change it from a convenient way to get from SF to LA to a one-way ticket from Fresno to Bakersfield. Needless to say, there are lots of random idiots in government ranging from  incompetent to hellbent on sabotaging any potentially good government program: should we really be betting a costly attempt to ensure our ecological well-being on the hopes that neither type will come into power for the next 20 years? (This might be construed as giving into metaphorical terrorism, but thems the breaks.)<p>This also is not a matter of public versus private transit: it's trivially easy to imagine buses taking advantage of them to lower costs significantly, and not at all difficult to imagine totally new forms of public transit being made available.",1337736988

If there is reason to suspect that a tack is invalid (say, because it's very old), then soften the warning message. (This would probably mean that a domain has changed owners. In that case, I want to at least clear cookies for that domain, and would appreciate a warning and an easy user interface for doing so.)<p>And if I visit a site exactly twice, I see a tack the first time, and I don't see it the second time, then regardless of whether it was an attack the first time and is okay now, or was okay the first time and is an attack now, I <i>absolutely must know</i> because that is <i>not</i> something that will happen legitimately.<p>Also, I would add the following language: ""If TACK validation fails, the client SHOULD provide an easily accessible mechanism for submitting the certificate and associated information to a third party for analysis.""

This not an issue in a programming job.<p>Let's not ""take this to the extreme"", and instead be realistic. Your ""ticking bomb"" would be the first in history. Like I said, no drug is tested for 20 years before being released (and approved by FDA), so if there was such a risk, then with the sheer number of new drugs developed, you'd see these disasters left and right. Where are they?",1228726657

If you really want to control or log what people are doing through your network, you have to FORCE them to go through a proxy, and the only way to do that is with a firewall and with a transparent proxy, not by putting configuration on a piece of hardware that someone else, the user, has physical access to and uses day in and day out.",1228726001

389666,comment,388876,389557,0,0,thwarted,,,"This is somewhat of a contrived example.  I can't think of any subroutine in perl that I've written, or interfaced with, or seen in production code, that takes multiple types beyond the first argument.  If any function is doing that, the function is too complex and should be refactored.  What you do see a lot of is stuff of the forms:<p><pre><code>   sub foo {\n      my($someflag, @subjects) = @_\n\n   sub foo {\n      my($self, %options) = @_\n\n   sub foo {\n      my($positional, %named) = @_\n</code></pre>\netc.  And in fact, when the way you call these is the 90% case for functions, at least in perl.<p><pre><code>   sub dosomething_with_data(@) { ... }\n   @data = (1, 2, 3);\n   @moredata = (4, 5, 6);\n   dosomething_with_data(@data, @moredata);\n\n   sub invoke(%) { ... }\n   %common_opts = (a=>1, b=>2);\n   invoke(%common_opts, c=>3);\n   invoke(%common_opts, c=>6, d=>5);\n   %overrides = (b=>3);\n   invoke(%common_opts, %overrides, c=>6);\n</code></pre>\n(I included the subroutine prototypes for clarity).  In this case, perl is exactly DYIM without the programmer having to think about list folding, array splicing, or hash merging.  It just works.  This would appear to be true dynamic typing, rather than dynamic typing where I still need to be strict about how I handle the values.",1228725541

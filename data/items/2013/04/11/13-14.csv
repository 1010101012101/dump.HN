5531950,comment,5531067,5531641,1,0,waps,,,"The problem is the true answer to light environmental impact does not fit very well in either side's political ideology.<p>Pick whatever mode of transportation that costs the least, and the chance is very good that it's environmental impact is also the least of the available options. This provides a good rule of thumb. A small gasoline car (there are no small electrical cars) will easily win out over all alternatives, in some cases even over public transport.<p>Even human power (ie. bikes, walking) is not as green as you'd think. Humans eat expensive multiple times reprocessed food. Especially meat is expensive. And moving does actually cost energy. I wonder if anyone's ever done a rigorous calculation of that. I did some back of the envelope calculations, and knowing that a trained athlete's body can approach efficiencies of 25% in some cases (normal people, 10% at best), and that food has to be transported > 100km on average, I found walking/biking is only barely more environmentally friendly than an efficient, small car (assuming equivalent distance, of course, and assuming 5liters/100km). Using energy gained from eating meat to walk is very likely to be less efficient than driving (yet that's exactly what athletes do, although they have their increased efficiency).<p>Of course that's not to say walking/running/biking doesn't have other advantages. But humans burn fuel to produce co2 + work just as cars do, it's just much less visible.",1365688523

Perhaps my understanding of bitcoins isn't correct, but I thought that if there were no miners then transactions would stop being processed and the currency would basically stop working and die.<p>I know right now bitcoins are still being created/produced by miners, but at some point in the future that will stop happening and miners will be compensated through transaction fees as a percentage of each transaction. At that point if price of bitcoins falls below the cost to mine we likely will see people stop mining and transactions ceasing until the price rises enough for it to be worthwhile.<p>Of course bitcoin is a bit special in that there are a lot of fans of it that will likely be completely willing to accept a loss to keep the currency going. As we all know humans don't act as perfect economic-minded rationalists. \nBut I still think the cost of production is a good bottom metric to keep an eye on. If the price falls below that we will know that the currency is in rather dire straits and being artificially propped up by those with an interest in keeping it going.",1365688494

5531941,comment,5529202,5529658,4,0,aethertap,,,"Personally, I'd prefer to assume more of the responsibility for selecting healthful food for my family, if it came with the freedom to choose it. I've run into a number of ""harm in the name of help"" regulations in that regard. For example, in order to sell meat in packaged cuts, it must be butchered at a USDA inspected facility. That sounds sensible at first glance, but it creates a problem for people who want humanely-raised, hormone and antibiotic free meat: running a USDA inspected processing facility is very expensive, and the only way to do it (currently) is to go for large volume. That means that the same facility that processes the conventional meat will be processing my meat, exposing it to both chemicals and pathogens  that it would never otherwise have come into contact with (resistant forms of e. coli, among other things). In a large facility such as that, contamination from one animal has the potential to spread to many more. Health threats from this are uncommon, but they do happen and the size of the facilities means that their effects are widespread rather than localized.<p>Add to that the common practice of adding fat (from other animals) to ground meat, and you end up with a recipe for reduced-quality meat. One of the biggest reasons to eat grass-finished meat is its balance of omega fatty acids. When the leaner grass-finished meat is fatted up with fat from industrial animals, that benefit is lost. The regulation that was meant to help did help in the average, but it also made it more difficult to go beyond average.<p>One side-effect of regulation in agriculture in general seems to be to cut the small producers off from the bottom by centralizing and raising inspection costs. That in turn reduces diversity in the food supply and makes it more prone to large-scale outbreaks of problems (e.coli in spinach recently comes to mind).<p>It also has a second effect, which is that people trust food too much (rice from China seems to be a case in point). Because all food is inspected and certified transparently by <i>someone else</i>, consumers take little interest in the process, which makes it easier for things that aren't on the standard inspection list to escape notice.<p>Personally, I'd love to see a voluntary style of inspection, where a producer can opt in to one or more inspection programs in order to receive a certification. Consumers would then look for labels indicating whatever style of inspection they prefer (right now we basically have organic and not organic, but there are many others that might be relevant). There is definitely a need for inspection in the food supply, but I think that our current model of forcing all producers into a tiny number of alternatives is less than optimal.",1365688427

5531924,comment,5531548,5531699,9,0,daniel-levin,,,"'actual business problems and domain knowledge'<p>This is critically important. In the past few months, I've done a lot of networking with the tech entrepreneurs in my city. After speaking to these guys, I became aware of problems I didn't even know existed. It turns out that corporate South Africa (and probably the world over) have a massive number of problems they need solved. For example: fleet management, business reports, operations (like using Voronoi diagrams to see which restaurant chain 'dominates' an area). This surprised me because as someone without exposure to a real business environment, I couldn't conceive why people would actually buy reports products and resource planning software. If you asked almost any CS major to explain what a 'enterprise resource planning application' should do I can quite safely bet that they won't be able to accurately describe what problems it addresses and how it solves them (assuming the grad has no first-hand experience in dealing with this kind of problem).<p>I realised how as an individual I have been exposed to mainly B2C companies. Now, having been introduced to real, profitable B2B companies, I see that the domain of problems to solve and businesses to build is huge. 'Get out of the building' really summarises this concept well. Get exposure to real business problems and you <i>will</i> find someone who has an unsolved problem that you can attack. A nice example of this (not a <i>business</i> problem but a real one nonetheless) is the other day I had to collect my calculus test. There were 1000+ people contending with each other to find their paper in 50 semi-sorted piles. It was chaotic. I know that there is a better way to do this (fast and efficient distribution of unique papers to 1000+ people) - I'm currently thinking about how to solve this problem. The takeaway idea here is that there are tons and tons of problems out there and exposure to the real world will give you the opportunity to see these problems and begin solving them.",1365688269

Or at least you must have some way to identify and exclude the easy-to-solve instances.<p>Example: SAT-solving is NP-complete, but nonetheless heuristic SAT solvers are very good in practice, which makes its hardness too weak for cryptographic use. That can be ameliorated by trying to identify a more specific subset of ""actually hard to solve SAT"" (some of the research on the SAT ""phase transition"" aims at this), but it's pretty difficult. A few problems like integer factorization seem to have just arrived with this apparent always-hard property, but attempts to engineer it have been less successful, hence to my knowledge no used-in-practice cryptosystem is based on taking an NP-hard problem and turning it into a cryptographically useful one-way function (even though Diffie & Hellman suggested that as a research agenda way back in 1976).<p>I wrote an essay on that subject a few years ago, since the reverse question also comes up in AI discussions: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/nphard_not_always_hard.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/nphard_not_always_hard.html</a>",1365688166

They have definitely improved some UI/UX on the app, but nothing ground breaking, to me. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Foursquare but they are getting harder to ""keep loving"" when they simply can't seem to hit their full potential.<p>I only use the service now if a location has a check-in special of some sorts. And to get those specials, you need more adaption from local businesses and I think that is where they are failing. I live in a big city, and I think I maybe see one new business a MONTH (at most) that actually utilizes Foursquare, and majority of the time it's just a big chain type store. They need to get a team together to pitch to the smaller indie type shops to get them on board to get users interested again. I'm also in the midwest, so maybe they are better in bigger coast cities?<p>EDIT (<i>additional thoughts</i>): I think they also won the hearts of their original users with the app ""game-ification"" which was incredible (at the time), but I think they need more than that now-a-days. It seems like <i>every</i> new app has ""badges"", ""awards"", etc. While it's good that Foursquare was one of the originals by doing that in a social setting, it's irrelevant now because so many businesses are doing it better than them. Just because you created the first wheel, doesn't automatically make you the best, and I think they are forgetting that and not thinking outside of the box of how to make their app more social and connect users like it originally had.",1365688109

I dont believe in compulsory licencing but believe in price control. Let those patent holder companies have exclusive rights but govt should have the right to determine the price based on the purchasing power of the people. The better option of course is govt or the insurance companies negotiate with patent holder. But in India there is no health insurance run by govt that addresses the real price of drugs.

I figure since it is my post, I'll address some of the comments below:<p>""Working for someone else is not all bad, even if building your own thing is your ultimate goal."" -Kyllo<p>I am not saying it's bad at all! It's perfectly fine to work for someone else but if you are entrepreneurial-minded, it's best to intern at either a startup or a completely unrelated field to what you are used to, SO that you may be able to find an area in that industry where software/hardware can optimize it.<p>""There is a huge difference between that. A good job will have some nice engineers there, that might be willing to help you out and push you to learn how to code correctly."" -stevoo<p>So the main reason to intern is to just become a better coder? Doubtful. Just to be completely blunt, the main reason college students intern is to have a secure job after graduation.<p>""Interning was a great start for me and helped me meet a ton of people. The difference was I interned at a startup."" -blakeshall<p>Yeah I explicitly say this in my post! Working for a startup is completely reasonable as you will hopefully be able to directly help with the companies' organic idea.<p>""it's just not very appealing to take risks with your finances"" -iansinke<p>There is very little risk taking with finances in the sense that you really don't have to spend anything to build. What you are losing is the money that COULD be made doing a summer internship. Being an entrepreneur is risky, though, so this risk will have to be taken at some point if you want to exercise that desire, right? Better now in college than after where you really will be taking risks with your finances (living expenses while trying to have a startup).<p>My Takeaway: This post should be titled differently because it seems that people are just reading the title and not the actual post.<p>I also may have not taken into account the money aspect as much (I promise I am not a snob)...I guess if money is an issue and you need to work, then interning is fine but at least do it at a company that will help to enhance your entrepreneurial mind!

Saudi Arabia does have one of the largest military budgets in the world, but that does not translate to better or more military. It translates to buying more equipment and giving more money to the weapons industry in the US, the UK and other countries. The US is the main beneficiary, so it is kind of like protection money.<p>In particular, Saudi Arabia is far from the biggest military force in the Middle East in practice. Israel, Egypt, Iran, and Saddam-era Iraq are/were all far stronger. The last fact is the reason that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait invited the US and the coalition when Saddam invaded Kuwait, despite the loss of face.

When Boston's big ring road (Rte. 128) was built in the 1950s, people were allowed to ride bicycles in the two right-hand lanes (!). I was surprised to learn that a bunch of kids (15 or 16 year olds) used the road to bike from Boston's western edge to Mount Monadnock in New Hampshire (1), about 80 miles. A lot of people might say ""big deal, I can do a century"" but this was using 3-speed bikes. These kids didn't think ""it's too far, can't be done"" but rather ""we have these relatively modern bikes, can take the highway for part of the way, let's try"".

Not to mention they would have been well within the budget range to develop nuclear weapons without ever having to test like North Korea</i><p>And that makes the business of a sovereign country something the US has any say in it because?<p>><i>The US also didn't sit around and leave Europe high and dry in conflicts like the Kosovo War, because following your logic why should the US be dragged into a purely European conflict.</i><p>The US shouldn't have been involved at all in the Kossovo war. They just wanted to establish Kosovo as a protectorate, and have a solid base in the Balkans.

Let's hope China can play the counter-balance in the future. (Sure, China has it's flaws. But the counter-balance does have to be totally progressive or democratic. Just as the US is not. It just have to be there, and stand as a limit to the other's power0.<p>><i>It's a sad state of affairs that crippling the development of foreign countries is in our own best interest, but personally I enjoy my way of life</i><p>Sure.

After all, our current cars still use the lead/acid batteries which have not changed much since they entered production in 1881, aside from the invention of a sealed version in the 1970s.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/05/25/us-lithium-analysis-idUSTRE54O2CP20090525"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/05/25/us-lithium-analysi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://junkscience.com/2012/08/09/rare-earth-mining-in-china-comes-at-a-heavy-cost-for-local-villages/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://junkscience.com/2012/08/09/rare-earth-mining-in-china...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_air_car"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_air_car</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechargeable_battery#Table_of_rechargeable_battery_types"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechargeable_battery#Table_of_r...</a>",1365685771

We approached this one by converting it to a private good within the U.S. But that's not the only solution.<p>A natural entity to pay for drug development is health insurance companies, who would save a lot of money if drugs were patent-free. But they don't in fact fund patent-free drugs, since their competitors could free-load.<p>Bernie Sanders proposed a solution: tax the insurers so none can freeload, and use the money for drug development, and keep everything patent-free. The insurers could come out ahead. (Iirc he had a slightly more complex arrangement that didn't require the government to decide who would be funded.)<p>It's worth noting that patents don't only reward inventors, they also increase their costs. The book <i>The Gridlock Economy</i> talks about this, and mentions one biotech firm that thought it had a cure for Alzheimer's. It infringed on thirty patents, and each patent-holder thought it had the most important part and charged accordingly. They had to abandon the whole thing.",1365685680

When you avoid the regulation, you take the safety of the currency into your own hands. MtGox should not refund this in any way shape or form. The problem was entirely his fault.

Sure, it may have some effect on application performance, but it doesn't address the underlying problem.  It's the algorithm that's broken.  Taking your application code to a supremely experienced developer for a code review would expose the underlying problem of the O(n!) algorithm in your program and help you rework that section of code.  Visiting a good therapist is like having a code review for your brain.",1306612743

The forward reaction is beta decay, and is favored by lone neutrons and by the neutrons in some atomic nuclei (i.e. radioactive isotopes that undergo beta decay). Presumably the half-life of a nucleous is determined by the degree of favorability of the beta decay reaction within that nucleus. The article already mentions that the reverse reaction (neutron formation) is favored under the conditions of a neutron star, since the pressure favors the side of the reaction with fewer particles. The gravitational potential energy released as the neutron star collapses supplies the energy required for the reverse reaction.<p>Disclaimer: I am not a physicist.",1306611877

The first is the OP type:  generational poverty based on dependence and a mind-set of either victimization or unbreakable poor choice habits.  They are stuck.  Getting these kids out of the situation, is as he says, nigh impossible.  I've taught 1000s of these kids, and their upbringing, the habits they learn, and don't learn, the role models they have, are difficult to escape and change.  A handful of students out of each grade somehow leave - and never come back.  The one characteristic they all seem to share is that somewhere along the line (genetics or personality) they have a work ethic or type A character.  Even so, they do not have the social skills to advance very far in their careers past college and entry-level job.<p>The second type is the working poor.  They don't really exist anymore as I know them in my parent's generation.  They bust ass in 16 hour days of hard labor, save money and penny pinch, always planning for the future.  Now days, this attitude is found in many middle class families.  My uncle won't even collect his SS check because ""he doesn't need it.""  My relatives would rather starve than take anything from the government or even their local church.<p>The first type learns how to do the opposite: game the welfare and social system for every penny and benefit and get, even if it requires dishonesty.  These people coach their children on what to say at school to the adults to ensure they get all of the free benefits, and to ensure we don't call welfare for an inspection of their homes or income.<p>/rant off",1306611452

There are probably several different mechanisms here. For example, alcohol causes inflammation.

It's the same thing with any drug. E.g. you can smoke weed one or two times per week, or you can smoke weed 30+ times per week, but if you smoke weed say 5 times per week then you'll just be depressed all the time except for right after you smoke.

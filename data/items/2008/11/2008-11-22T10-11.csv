The politicians who are voting (or in most cases, not voting) on this issue care little and understand less about the data management side of things, and furthermore when has government EVER been efficient?<p>Interesting from a database POV, though.",1227351315

They are nearly always in default locations.<p>Or you could parse the URL - I had a similar task some time ago, and I went with URLs - Blogger and Typepad are consistent; WordPress depends on the blog, of course, but you could figure out several most popular patterns (e. g. /yyyy/mm/dd/posttitle, /id-posttitle) and get like 90% of all blogs right.<p>Or maybe, just maybe, you could use some third parties that have already figured it out via RSS - maybe Technorati?",1227350296

Also the article didn't mention anything on who confirmed and how. It talks about some computer simulations and concludes:<p><i>Although physicists expected theory to match experiment eventually, it is an important landmark.</i><p>Since when did physicists start considering computer simulations as experimental evidence?",1227350284

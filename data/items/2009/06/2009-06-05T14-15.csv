In this case, it is particularly clear to see because the person being held down has virtually no resources at all, but it is merely a difference of scale, not kind, to many other such endless regulations.<p>All regulations have social costs. It should be a routine question ""What will the costs be?"", ""Who will bear them?"", and ""<i>Is it worth it?</i>"", but the questions are so rarely asked. No matter how small the cost, it can be the difference between success and failure for somebody. A full economic accounting often shows the costs aren't worth it because of second order effects (which would be beyond the scope of a HN post, but for example, once the gate has been set up, those on the right side of the gate can artificially charge more, often negating the value to society of the regulation).<p>If you don't like this result, think twice next time you feel tempted to suggest that the answer to some problem is regulation. Maybe it is. But if you don't know what the costs are, and you haven't thought about how people will change their behavior after you've put your regulation in place, you haven't got it all worked out yet.",1244212939

But will Java AP help you a lot? It depends on you. If you took a class on C++ and were forgetting it by the time you took the final, that means you weren't using C++.<p>You can't learn to program from a class, you have to do it yourself. So learning Java will help you, but that won't necessarily happen if you take Java AP.<p>My strategy has generally been to take the easiest possible combination of classes to get a degree (because let's face it, that world wants you to have a degree), and I spend a lot more time trying practical things. Last semester I wrote my own UNIX shell. I'm friends with a guy who took a class on UNIX, and thought I should take the class with him. But I can tell you right now - he hasn't got a clue how to use his knowledge. So who came out of that semester with a better education?",1244211130
643197,comment,641709,641827,0,0,ZachPruckowski,,,"A patent on a ball-point pen only affects how you make your pen.  A company can make a competing, non-ballpoint pen that still writes on the same paper and is still the same color (though it might be more expensive or messier or whatever), so not licensing the patent isn't disastrous.  Even with a patent on something like an engine, I can still design my own (likely less efficient) engine, which'll still drive on the same roads and probably even use the same gasoline that works slightly differently.<p>A patent on something like MP3 or One-Click-Ordering prevents competitors from including a feature.  If I want to make an e-commerce site, I have to have multiple clicks to order something or I have to license Amazon's patent.  If I want to make any sort of media hardware or software that can encode/decode or import/export or even play the content out there, I need a slew of patents licensed.  There's no work-around or alternative method, I simply can't include that feature without licensing.<p>It's the difference between ""licensing this patent lets me build off the work of another company to make my product better"" and ""licensing this patent is mandatory to compete in this field"".  In my mind, patents of the first type are fine, while patents of the second type are bad.<p>I should be able to create something that can (for example) play MP3s without licensing, but do so at the cost of efficiency or power (because I'm using a less effective method).",1244211130

In particular, I find it extremely refreshing reading Fred's responses to the thread. The fact that Fred was willing to leverage his personal network to help out an anonymous 17 year old who left a fairly crude comment on his blog not only sets an example for how people should treat one another, but is indicative of his investing philosophy. He is always looking for the diamond in the rough, and he isn't afraid to dig for it.",1244211012

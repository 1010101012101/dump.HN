Allow me to retort:<p>* Public transportation in the Bay Area is a shambles, and, in particular, getting between any two points in the (tiny) city of San Francisco involves interaction with the worst bus system in the country.<p>* Housing is <i>spectacularly</i> expensive, which, in hacker teams, simply means you're going to be living in half the space you have now, with no amenities.<p>* Office space in San Franscisco? I already spent the modifier ""spectacular"", so let's go with ""catastrophically"" expensive, meaning: your office won't be in the city, it will be in San Mateo, which despite its relative proximity to the city, will still be an hour and a half commute. Unlucky enough to wind up in Santa Clara? I was. My commute from SOMA often exceeded two hours <i>each way</i>.<p>* Half to 3/4s of your friends are going to live in the South Bay. No matter where you choose to live --- San Francisco or the suburban Mallhalla of the South Bay --- you are going to be 45 minutes to an hour away from anyone you want to visit.<p>* An ongoing dispute between the dispatchers, the city, and medallion owners keeps taxicabs artificially scarce, so that you are going to wait 20 minutes to catch one on Folsom or downtown.<p>* There isn't one good place in the city to see a show, but that doesn't matter, because your favorite band skips San Francisco.<p>* Last call in San Francisco? Earlier than other cities.<p>* Weather? Choose between ""brown"" or ""wet"".<p>* Streets? Laden with human feces and garbage. Am I being hyperbolic?

170927,comment,170838,170838,0,0,tstegart,,,"Take a look at most blogging platforms for ideas of carrots or sticks. I.e., you get a free blog, but can get a lot more if you pay.<p>I think your question boils down to four things:<p>What is core to enjoying the site? 
I haven't looked at your site, but someone mentioned games. If you want people to come back, it should be enjoyable. If they come back and something they expect isn't available to them and requires payment, they might begin to resent you. If you're going to embrace the freemium model, I think most successful people have made as much of the core stuff as free as they can. I'm not saying make as many things free as you can, I'm saying make as many important core elements as free as you can.<p>What are your competitors doing?
Two things you should look for. One, what are they charging for that you're ok with giving away for free? Its a marketing tactic. You can get their users if you provide something better. There's nothing worse than charging for something just because you needed to pick something to charge for. People will look at it and say ""Thats so simple, why isn't that free?"" 
Two, what do their users think about the things they charge for/give away. This is a competitive intelligence tactic. Go read their forums, and look for clues. Did they try and charge for something and have a huge uproar? Or did people just say, ""sure, ok"". What is the most requested feature they have? Its pointless to make your competitor's mistakes when you can see what the results were. Don't copy their bad choices. But to know what was bad you need to do some research.<p>How much does it cost:
I think most people are ok with paying for stuff they know costs you money, IF you clearly make that the case from the start. If you give away almost everything for free and then try to introduce cost into the mix, it doesn't go down as well as it would than if you had said upfront ""Hey, this costs me a lot to provide, so its going to have to go into the premium side."" You also have to think somewhat long term. Advertising won't pay for everything, and its likely that you can't keep covering all the costs. You won't be around long if everything is free. If something is very expensive to provide, ask people to pay for it.<p>Don't be afraid to change:
As your site grows and gets older, get feedback on what parts of your site people really use. You can switch stuff around from the pay or free columns and experiment a little.  If there is one feature people consistently ask for to be included on the free side, and it hardly costs you anything to provide it, why not give it away?<p>A word about advertising. I may be in the minority here, but I don't care if advertising is on the site or not as long as its not annoying. I wouldn't pay to have no ads, because I'm not bothered by them. If I was bothered by them, I probably wouldn't use your site. Why don't you research how well that has worked for others. Do people actually pay to remove ads, or is it just something in a list of things to make money that nobody has actually bothered to research lately to see if it works? Almost every site we use today has ads, its just a fact. I say keep them across the site, make them somewhat inconspicuous, and use the revenue to offset the things you give away for free.",1208896721

There are too few posts per day that critically think about what is being discussed.<p>In this case, I don't remember seeing one post about following a combination of strategies at once (if there were a couple of posts, that doesn't make the situation any less sad.)  Making a smart product, having a strategy to grow, and offering a free viral version as well as a paid version that pays your bills is the way to go!  In fact, having an abundance of free customers will increase the chance you NEED investment, not just the fact that VC's will be more interested.  They're more interested because they know you will need money!<p>If you have a paid version that pays your operating costs, and gives value, you can keep working on your startup indefinitely.  It's also another way to get VC's interested.  But except in this case, you logically won't be a little bitch.  Instead of having to fake confidence while your cash flow has brought you down to nothing (more likely below nothing), and the only reason you're getting a good valuation is because there are many, many VCs around, and they like that you went to Stanford or something, you will instead be in a situation where you proved people will pay for your product and you don't really need to time selling your company or getting investment in the right cycle of the economy.  So which option is better?  Whichever one is better at the time!  That's what DHH has been saying.  If he actually needed investors for a venture, I'm sure he would surely take the money he needs.  But he doesn't, so he doesn't.  There's no wrong way.<p>But he's wrong because Silicon Valley gives you that option to pursue VC's in case you need to, and the quality of life seems to be among the best places in the world.  And it's sure better than living in the middle of nowhere.  And it's great that you can meet cool people and ask them feedback about your apps without receiving questions like ""why are you doing a startup"" (because working for most companies is a rip off), ""wow you must be rich"" (people think it's rich people  who do startups), and ""can you fix my computer"" (no explanation needed.)<p>I like YCombinator's approach, where one can launch and see what happens for a few months before figuring out the best steps -- more angel funding, VC funding, multiple VC funding, selling, quitting, changing an idea, or even having a paid version.",1208896281

170911,story,,,2,4,palish,"Self-Commenting Code",,"Consider this programming style:<p><pre><code>  for each function,
    - first write out its algorithm in comments,
    - then implement that.
</code></pre>
It seems like that programming style can result in higher-quality code with fewer bugs.<p>As an example, let's implement a simple ""ends_with?"" string utility function.  The function takes two strings and returns whether the first ends with the second:<p><pre><code>  bool endsWith( const char* haystack, const char* ending )
</code></pre>
Following our new programming style, we first write out its implementation in comments:<p><pre><code>  bool endsWith( const char* haystack, const char* ending )
  {
    // find the end of [haystack] and [ending].

    // if [haystack] is shorter than [ending] then it can't end with [ending], so return false.

    // walk backwards through both strings.

      // if a character differs, return false.

    // otherwise, [haystack] ends with [ending], so return true.
  }

</code></pre>
Pretty straightforward.  And now we can implement the function in an equally straightforward way:<p><pre><code>  bool endsWith( const char* haystack, const char* ending )
  {
    // find the end of [haystack] and [ending].
    const char *haystackEnd = haystack;
    const char *endingEnd = ending;
    while( *haystackEnd ) 
      haystackEnd++;
    while( *endingEnd ) 
      endingEnd++;

    // if [haystack] is shorter than [ending] then it can't end with [ending], so return false.
    if( haystackEnd - haystack < endingEnd - ending )
      return false;

    // walk backwards through both strings.
    while( endingEnd != ending )
    {
      // if a character differs, return false.
      if( *endingEnd != *haystackEnd )
        return false;

      --endingEnd;
      --haystackEnd;
    }

    // otherwise, [haystack] ends with [ending], so return true.
    return true;
  }
</code></pre>
What is interesting about this style is that the result will usually be simple to read and understand.  The key is to write out the function's comments <i>first</i>, not last.  Is this a common programming style?<p>A friend of mine uses this technique in his game engine to great effect.  The engine's source code is beautiful, mostly because each algorithm is simple and can be understood by reading clear English.",1208896035

It sounds like you answered your own question: you feel that the stuff you're adding to the site will make it worthy of paying for, as opposed to your current site which presumably is less worth paying for (but it sounds like you have a significant number of users happy with your free site).  Why not just charge for the new features that you're adding?",1208895536

Hate by definition is illogical.<p>People hate Microsoft because it IS cool and because they ARE the leader. However they then try to justify their hate with rational reasons. Hate comes first, then comes reason, not the other way around.<p>Because if reason came first, hate would never follow. Perhaps dislike, or distaste would. Microsoft has its flaws and weaknesses but only because it has accomplished far more than many. You never hear people applauding Microsoft all you ever hear is the same old rhetoric.<p>To be a true critic one has to acknowledge both the positives and the negatives. Otherwise you're just hater for the sake of convenience.",1208895273

Seattle feels just as diverse as NYC to me, just in different ways.<p>If you're into finance, advertising, and fashion, NYC is hard to beat.  Seattle, OTOH, wins big at mountain climbing (we have mountains nearby), aviation (we have Boeing nearby), and martial arts (we have Japan nearby), for example.  It's also a hotspot for medicine, microbrews, and certain kinds of music.<p>I've been to NYC a few times, and if you're into the things they do well, I'm sure it's heaven.

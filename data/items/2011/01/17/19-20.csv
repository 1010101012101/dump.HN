2113201,comment,2111842,2111842,0,0,megaman821,,,"Why is pulling caching into the middle of an app a good idea? Memcached should be a last resort. The database should have a cache for things that get asked for over and over. Having a full page caching solution like Varnish is pretty doable for most sites where the only customization is the username at the top of the page which could be populated with javascript. Cache invalidation is a hard problem, why would most devs want anything to do with it? On lightly customizable sites, the only thing I would consider using memcached for is a faster session store.",1295294349

2113196,comment,2112918,2112918,0,0,rhizome,,,"The thing I noticed in the slow new Twitter is that typing a new status seems to involve continuous autofill-like behavior for each character typed, which seemed to introduce round-trip lag (or javascript-parsing, or...) and causes characters to appear at a rate of ~1/second. Unusable.<p>And this is one way that dominant sites fall: business considerations are given priority over the user experience. Maybe they just have Flickr-itis and just can't adapt to leaving well enough alone, but for the time being I'm on old-Twitter and not contributing much to the Twitterverse until this is sorted out. If it never winds up being fixed, I've got a head start in living without them.<p>There is also a possible Second System Effect amongst Twitter's UX gods. It's interesting that after having switched to the new Twitter a couplefew weeks ago, last week I started seeing a ""Wanna switch back to the old Twitter?"" header. Of course I did, but to me this possibly points to a level of complaints that I did not realize.",1295294231
2113195,comment,2107264,2108342,0,0,epistasis,,,"Think of it as a massive key-value store: you construct your query off the key, use that to pull out the key-value pair, and when you sequence your key you continue to sequence more in order to pull out the value. If you prefer sequential addresses, your key could be just that.<p>And actually, this could be done at a much higher density than what the original poster described, as he's counting the full cell in the density calculation, and DNA is only a small fraction of the cellular volume. You could duplicate all the DNA 10-100 times in the same amount of space once you take out all the ribosomes, proteins and extra water. And as long as it's not stored in direct sunlight or next to your pile of plutonium, DNA is going to be much much more stable than aligning magnetic fields. We're still getting good DNA sequence out of bones that are tens of thousands of years old.<p>When you think of nanotechnology and miniaturization, think of biology, because that's where all the real nanotechnology is going on.  We've not done any better than nature when it comes to making small machinery. Nature has already invented the commodity interchangeable parts (amino acids and nucleic acids) that can self-assemble into rather fantastic machines.<p>However, we have beaten mother nature on latency: as I alluded to, a DNA database like this would have latency on the order of days for a lookup.  On the other hand, as much parallel access as you can imagine is built in, without additional volume.  And this isn't a system that has been engineered at all, I'm just talking about the fundamental properties of a little puddle of DNA and water.  If half the engineering that went into modern computer hardware were put into a DNA database, it could be quite competitive with our electronic systems.",1295294224

After a couple of months I was almost ready for my first solo flight.<p>Then I started looking at my total monthly expenses for instruction and plane rental.  When I looked at the numbers, I decided that this must be a good time to buy a house.  I was spending what was, for me, a great deal of money.  The money I was spending on flying easily paid for a house payment once I made that decision.<p>One other thing that was quite unexpected.  At the time, I was working as a consultant doing large ERP system implementations for fortune 500 companies.  As anyone who does this for a living will tell you, this can be a very stressful occupation.  The multitasking aspect of flying was like: watch 15 things all at once, make sure nothing goes wrong, and if you screw up, the consequences will be extremely dire, and everything is very time critical, and all eyes are on you as you make very important actions.  At some point, it occurred to me: ""hey! This is exactly the same kind of stress I feel at work!""<p>Another thing that surprised me initially about flying small planes.  It feels like being in a flying lawnmower, nothing at all like being in a commercial jet.  It made me feel very sick at first.  They say you get used to it with time.<p>I think, though, that at some point the situational awareness and multitasking becomes second nature, and you can do it feeling merely alert instead of stressed and overtaxed.  But I never spent enough money on flying time to get to that point personally.<p>There's nothing like the fun of staring at a map and plotting where you're going to go, though, I hope I'm financially successful enough to get back into it some day when other affairs are in order.",1295292975

But with the fullscreen version, since it's all AJAX and to make things easy on myself, I converted everything (except file uploads) to send data via POST (all links are generated by a function so instead of href it's onclick+ajax)... along with the token too of course... which was all a win-win because I lifted the data limit that GET used to impose as well.<p>But anyway... today I learned that even though GET and POST are no different security-wise... always use a secret token when security is an issue... and it's best to use POST because it allows MUCH more data than GET.",1295292665

This isn't being sexist, it's being honest.<p>I don't think you're being sexist. I <i>do</i> think that your line of thought is completely wrong. The breakdown of traditional families <i>is</i> correlated with the breakdown of traditional gender roles, but this is not not NOT because working makes it hard for a woman to raise children. Rather, it's because women, given the choice to defy their traditional roles, have also decided frequently that they don't like the traditional family model and have chosen other lifestyles.<p>Carly Fiorina, for all I loathe her politically, was a powerful woman in the businessplace for two decades. And she's been married to the same man since 1985, and raised two stepdaughters. Meg Whitman too has been married for a long time and raised two children. The point is <i>not</i> that the traditional family model hasn't suffered. It's that the root of its suffering isn't that women are finding it hard to be emotionally available because all of a sudden they have jobs.<p>> This is the problem with discussions like these. Any non-PC point of view gets immediately shot down and accusations of sexism fly. If we truly want to get at the root cause of the imbalance, we must be able to ask the tough questions that might have uncomfortable answers.<p>I agree with you that there are uncomfortable answers! But I think that the uncomfortable answer is uncomfortable in the exact opposite of the direction you're going.<p>I don't think that the biggest problem in this discussion is that women are somehow genetically incapable of keeping up, because I know many women who can keep up and even surpass men at this. <i>I</i> think the biggest, most uncomfortable problem here is that vast swatches of our society are so wretchedly sexist that men have a hard time seeing just how difficult it is for women. We assume that we are in fact living in a post-sexism world, and that everybody is equal, when in fact we have decades and decades to go before women are truly seen as equals in society. And I'm not somehow exempt from this, by the way; it's been a process of literally <i>years</i> of talking to women and slowly realizing just how shitty they've got it.<p>Jean Hsu here is just one of hundreds of women whose stories have forced me to accept that while we might have a more equal society than history has ever seen before, that does <i>not</i> mean we are as equal as we ought to be. The status quo is still unfortunately sexist, and while one day perhaps we <i>will</i> get to the point where we can honestly assess the differences between men and woman, the conclusion we draw will <i>not</i> be that women simply can't do these things that we claim they can't do. The fact that we're arguing that right now is proof that we still have grossly distorted views of what an entire sex is capable of.<p>It's not that I'm calling you specifically sexist, hackinthebochs. And I apologize if I ever made it seem like that. But the society we both live in is profoundly sexist, in ways we don't even recognize, and so a lot of the arguments to be made about how it's okay that women have experiences like this are rooted in logic that's as sexist as it is commonly accepted. Does that make sense?",1295292013

2113023,comment,2110756,2112468,0,0,rorymarinich,,,"> While I do believe anyone can learn programing, thats not really the issue at hand. The question is how fast do most people take to it? I think programming is one of those things that only a certain type of person will take to it reasonably fast. This is important because there's a cost/benefit analysis people do when it comes to what's worth studying.<p>I can agree with that statement, to some extent. The composer Brian Eno once said of prodigies: ""The reason you get child prodigies in chess, arithmetic, and classical composition is that they are all worlds of discontinuous, parceled-up possibilities."" Programming fits the ""discontinuous possibilities"" mold very well.<p>The question is whether or not you want to keep teaching programming in a way that only clicks with those more prodigious people, or if you want to come up with approaches that let in people who may not have the same instant intuition. And, just as in classical music, if you encourage only the people who have a certain sort of aptitude, you're also encouraging people who will only ever approach programming in one certain way, and the result is that the medium as a whole suffers from lack of diversity.<p>> They teach programming by asking you to program. Unfortunately this is impossible for some 60% of the people who take a programming course. We have yet to come up with a better way.<p>It's not that they ask people to program that's problematic. (I'd like to see a citation for that 60%, as well; it sounds fishy.) I've taken several programming classes at several levels and I don't think anybody who gets what they're doing finds programming difficult.<p>The challenge, rather, and this is not <i>only</i> a challenge that comes up in programming courses, is figuring out how to make people <i>get</i> it. You need to develop a manner of teaching that makes all these actions somehow intuitive; why is it that we program in this particular way? What does each word mean? Why's each language constructed in its particular pattern, and how does that affect coding?<p>Teaching programming without putting serious thought into creating a comfortable abstraction for students is not really teaching programming at all. It's like teaching a creative writing class without simultaneously teaching literature (and, sadly, many creative writing classes are guilty of this). You can <i>pretend</i> that writing is an obscure, difficult art that only a select few minds can master. But I'm a skilled poet and I teach poetry to middle schoolers and I think it's safe to say that the reason most people can't write a good poem is that they don't understand the reason why they're writing a poem in the first place.<p>I had a teacher, in a high school Java class, who was actually very good at teaching this; I didn't recognize how good he was at the time. He took a class composed mostly of people who knew literally nothing about anything code-related, and in a year turned them without fail into programmers capable of making competent programs. No student dropped out or switched the class; he worked with what he had and didn't fail a single one of us.<p>The guy-to-girl ratio was pretty close to 1:1, for what it's worth. We had a surprisingly diverse class. And it was really surprising who ended up really showing a knack for coding and who didn't. Frequently the really good coders struggled for longer than the rest of us did, but when they hit upon how to get something done their approach was a lot better than the rest of the class's.<p>(And by the way, I'd like to mention that this is the best discussion of gender equality that I've <i>ever</i> read on Hacker News, and that I'm in a way really proud that we're having this conversation right here. Cheers to everybody on both sides for keeping this a relatively civil conversation; this is not an easy subject to discuss politely.)",1295290884

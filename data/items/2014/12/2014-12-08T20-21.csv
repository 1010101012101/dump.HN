The listed bracket 18-34 covers young adulthood where most eventual high earners would be earning near 0 in college, to late twenties with some people pursuing masters but most joining workforce, to <i>mid-thirties</i> with some people fully educated and having 10-12 years of experience in their field.  (e.g. a programmer graduating at 24 and earning $90K ($120K bay area) by 34 is not in any way unusual, but here gets averaged with others, maybe including his future peer, who are <i>just</i> starting college and are showing very low earnings for a few years.)<p>Likewise, &quot;living with a parent (18-34)&quot;... &quot;Bachelor&#x27;s degree (18-34)&quot;...

Anyways, I wanted to double check directions so I used google maps, and it came up with directions that were going to take me 2 hours. I laughed thinking, &#x27;oh technology, 2 steps forward, 1 step back&#x27;. So I drove down the way I already knew and was just double checking. With twenty minutes left in the drive, theres a deadstop traffic jam. Highway is closed. Turns out entire highways flooded in Detroit around 6-7am, and when I googled directions around 830am, google knew not to go that way, but I didn&#x27;t. Made it to the airport 3 hours later, with a flight 6 hours after that. I had never been so impressed with google maps before this though. How did it know not to go that way so fast?

In the same way that reference counting prevents you from leaking memory, a type system prevents certain kinds of mistakes that are generally solved with discipline in other programming languages - for example, in Python, I can construct the following program:<p><pre><code>    def greater_than(a, b):
        return a > b

    if __name__ == &#x27;__main__&#x27;:

Apple developed the OS that you&#x27;re using, so there&#x27;s hardly a trust issue when talking about running applications from Apple on top of the Apple-developed OS. Sandboxing doesn&#x27;t exist because of some high-minded ideal, it exists to solve the trust and security problem.<p>Apple should sandbox any apps they ship if at all possible, but only because it protects the app and the user from any security issues. If an app can be remotely exploited somehow, then being sandboxed prevents the exploit from having full access to the local filesystem. But beyond that one concern (which may not even be relevant for apps that don&#x27;t really do anything with the network), there&#x27;s no real reason to care whether Apple sandboxes a given app that they ship.<p>> Moreover, it objectively leads to a worse experience for customers<p>What does? You&#x27;re being a bit unclear here so I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re referring to with &quot;it&quot; here.

Doubtful.<p>> It&#x27;s an example how the MAS effectively cripples 3rd party apps without leaving them a choice<p>What do you mean, without leaving them a choice? The MAS is just one of many storefronts available to Mac users. 3rd-party apps that don&#x27;t wish to sandbox always have the choice of not using the MAS. They can continue to work exactly as they have done for the past several decades. The MAS is relatively new and is not replacing any existing software delivery mechanism, nor is it imposing any restrictions on apps that choose to ship outside the MAS. It doesn&#x27;t even prevent users from migrating to a non-MAS variant of the app later; it&#x27;s been well-known for a long time now how to have an app that supports both MAS and non-MAS distribution channels and have the non-MAS app still validate the MAS license.",1418071786

In 2013 there were about 20,000 untested rape kits in Texas alone -- 20,000 crimes that were reported, where a woman had semen, hair, and other evidence collected through an invasive procedure, that were entirely ignored [1]. And that&#x27;s only reported rapes. None of my friends who have been sexually assaulted have ever reported it (although these were all assaults by &quot;friends&quot;, not strangers). They just wanted it to go away.<p>To top it off, in many locations in the US women still have to pay for their own evidence collection. If you haven&#x27;t got the $600-$1200 it takes to pay for the exams yourself, you&#x27;re out of luck on the prosecution front! (Yes, this is sort of illegal, but it&#x27;s still happening [2].)<p>So rest easy -- come to the US where a woman&#x27;s statement will probably be ignored for a long time [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.texastribune.org/2013/01/04/clearing-texas-rape-kit-backlog-brings-hefty-price/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.texastribune.org/2013/01/04/clearing-texas-rape-k...</a>

The military may actually be doing it wittingly.  A spouse that only receives continuing benefits if their partner remains in the service will probably be in the military&#x27;s corner whenever re-enlistment comes up.<p>Interestingly enough, despite the topic of ex-spouses lagging slightly behind football, barracks stories, barbecue-related food, and generalized complaining about the government among the vets that I have known, not a single one of them has ever been in a position to do anything about it, regardless of their rank or tenure.  It seems to be an unintended consequence of a much larger problem, one that is politically untouchable.<p>I think it is entirely unsolvable as long as any cultural continuity exists within the institution, much like the problem of corruption in some law enforcement units.  Too many people have too much at stake in the status quo.<p>Another unintended consequence that may lead to suicide is that the provision of veterans&#x27; medical benefits has become much more expensive, particularly with respect to head injuries.  So injured veterans that should be receiving medical discharges for service-related injuries (along with those promised lifetime treatment benefits) are being discharged for other reasons, and their service records falsified.  PTSD patients may be denied benefits under the rationale that their PTSD symptoms are actually from a previously concealed psychological condition.  If the vet has a brain injury, but no pieces obviously missing, they may be informally classified as malingerers, to be treated accordingly.<p>It is often left to the person with a severe concussion to navigate a tangled web of bureaucracy on their own, to prove that they are not faking their injury--a task that could probably only be successfully negotiated by someone who was actually faking it.  That&#x27;s somewhat of a catch-22.<p>So when the organization that formerly saw to your every need suddenly decides to turn on you in your moment of weakness, I can see how that might generate a few bad thoughts--perhaps even suicidal impulses.",1418071184

But Apple has always said that the notification center is intended for information display, and it follows that having a bunch of apps use widgets that provide buttons to launch the app is in violation of the intention of the notification center. Apple should be consistent here, but I would not fault them for choosing to tell all apps (such as Evernote) that they need to remove similar buttons, rather than allowing Drafts to keep its button.",1418071021

8718969,comment,8718596,8718829,0,0,eridius,,,"> Notification center rejection<p>Wait, that app had a fake keyboard <i>inside</i> a notification center widget? That&#x27;s truly awful and roundly deserved to get rejected.<p>> Sandbox forces feature removal<p>I don&#x27;t see how this is relevant to your comment. This wasn&#x27;t a decision by app store review, or anything like that at all. This appears to simply be that the app was using functionality that is not possible to do inside the sandbox. If he was shipping on the MAS before, he must have been using a temporary exemption and would have known that it would have to get removed once those temporary exemptions stopped being allowed. This is a purely technical limitation and has nothing to do with the sort of management issues you&#x27;re complaining about.<p>> Slide to start<p>That seems like a legit rejection to me as well. Looking at the actual screenshots, they tried to make their control look and feel pretty damn close to the official Apple control. This is a control that Apple spent years training people meant &quot;unlock&quot; (or more specifically, &quot;unlock device&quot;). So even though Apple isn&#x27;t using it right now, they&#x27;re still well within their rights to claim that it is too similar to Apple&#x27;s own UI widget (especially for something that does completely different functionality).<p>I bet that if the slider didn&#x27;t look so intentionally similar to Apple&#x27;s own widget, he wouldn&#x27;t have had an issue. But he deliberately aped Apple&#x27;s UI, and should have expected this to eventually happen.<p>I&#x27;m also a bit irked that he&#x27;s trying to play this up as a big &quot;I got a bogus rejection!&quot; thing and completely ignored the fact that Apple told him to remove <i>or revise</i> it. The issue is not that the act of sliding a finger across a screen to start the race is verboten. It&#x27;s that his widget is <i>too similar</i> to Apple&#x27;s UI. Note the actual quotes:<p>> 8.3: Apps that appear <i>confusingly similar</i> to an existing Apple product, interface, or advertising theme will be rejected<p>[emphasis mine]<p>> The “slide to start the stopwatch” is similar to the “slide to unlock in iOS device”.<p>> Thank you for your message. In order for the app to be reconsidered for the App Store, please remove <i>or revise</i> the Slide To Start feature. Have a good day.<p>[emphasis mine]<p>> Specifically, the Slide to Start Race UI element is not appropriate and not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines as it is <i>too similar</i> to the iOS Slide to Unlock UI.<p>[emphasis mine]<p>Instead of trying to stoke public outrage, he should just accept that his UI widget, which was very obviously based directly on the slide-to-unlock widget, should be altered to not look so similar.<p>--<p>Yes, there are bogus decisions. PCalc is a good example. But there are also plenty of valid rejections too (many orders of magnitude more). And it&#x27;s a mistake to think that every publicized rejection is invalid.",1418070632

Especially when company policy mandates that system ruby versions need to be used.<p>/rant<p>It&#x27;s my experience that ruby applications usually require the $latest ruby version. Getting it to run properly with other ruby (diva) applications is just a pain.
This is especially annoying if the applications are managed with a deployment tool like puppet. Applying $PATH quirks to get a nice and consistent layout on these machines is not really the solution. 
Now, your solution whilst certainly being neat just creates another intermediate layer. I&#x27;m not sure if this is the solution. How do people manage the os updates on docker images? How how do people handle application updates? What if I want to define that in a sane manner? 
With puppet I can define a nice and sane process that handles everything from installation to updates to the removal of an app. I have a clear history and I&#x27;m able to see what is going on on the machine. I also have a defined and clear process to update the machines.<p>I&#x27;m just guessing but I don&#x27;t think that your solution is going to work for gitlab without applying a couple of patches to the source files. Routing SSH through port 22 of the host system is going to be a real pain. It also makes future updates a cheerful occurrence.<p>Nowadays I mostly do development in C, C++ and C# (OSX/Windows and some embedded stuff).

So for any biologic process that is parallelizing the operators are going to want to own the machines anyways.<p>In order to capture a real market, you&#x27;re going to have to figure out a way to offer parallelization services - be given a non-parallel experiment with certain parameters and scale it up on behalf of the users.

In this paper, the grad student (and lead author) who had spent four years of her graduate work on a previous paper had a nagging feeling that the data were strange.  By actually looking at the wells, she figured out post-publication (with nothing to gain) that the protein was sticking to sides of the 96-well plate and causing the observational data to be artefactual.  Then there was the question of how to do more experiments to <i>prove</i> that was going on.  And then the political problem of convincing her grad advisor to publish a retraction (well at least it was a retraction worth a 10 page paper and a new citation.  The story has a happy ending; she got a position at a pharma company largely on the back of her due diligence).",1418070540

This is due to things in nature usually being exponentially distributed, when you have an exponential distribution you will &quot;move away&quot; faster from higher valued digits and reach the next power of ten faster, there you will restart with a low first digits which is slow to move away from. For example, assuming a spread of about 50%, then 1+50%=1.5 (still starting with 1) but 5+50%=7.5 (not starting with same digit), and 8+50%=12 (starting with 1 again).",1418069895

The truth is that developers keep getting forced to remove functionality, sometimes the decisions are reversed but not always (and it might only work if you&#x27;ve got a large enough following).<p>I&#x27;ve had enough of this stuff and I&#x27;ve voted with my feet - I no longer develop for iOS and I&#x27;m back to the Mac, outside the MAS.<p>My absence won&#x27;t make any difference to Apple but it makes a huge difference to my wellbeing and health by not having to deal with this stuff. It pains me so much to see fellow developers&#x27; efforts just thrown down the garbage bin. It&#x27;s extremely demotivating to have your work crippled when you&#x27;re striving to create the best software. The reason why this keeps happening and will continue is simple - there are hundreds of thousands of people developing for iOS, it&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s playground and their rules - if you don&#x27;t like it, you can leave.

8718781,comment,8717309,8718769,0,0,FooBarWidget,,,"Built time only. Docker is only used by the Traveling Ruby authors (i.e. Phusion and contributors) for <i>building</i> the binaries. You, as a Ruby developer who just wants to distribute your app, just uses the binaries that we have already built and uploaded somewhere. There is no need for <i>you</i> to run Docker.<p>On Linux, Docker is used to provide a controlled, isolated build environment. In other words, it serves as a &quot;holy build box&quot; (<a href=""https://github.com/phusion/traveling-ruby#why-it-is-difficult-to-supply-a-precompiled-ruby-interpreter-that-works-for-all-end-users"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/phusion/traveling-ruby#why-it-is-difficul...</a>). There is no native Docker for OS X (i.e. a Docker which can run OS X binaries) so on OS X we try to get as close to an isolated, controlled build environment as we can by setting various environment variables (<a href=""https://github.com/phusion/traveling-ruby/blob/master/osx/internal/reset_environment.sh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/phusion/traveling-ruby/blob/master/osx/in...</a>), but it&#x27;s not perfect and I&#x27;m sure someone will have just the right amount of Homebrew libraries to interfere with it.<p>The build scripts are pretty simple. It needs more documentation, but here&#x27;s the gist:<p>- setup-docker-container - builds a Docker container which will function as an isolated build environment. Only need to do this once.<p>- setup-runtime - builds a runtime which is used inside the Docker container. Builds mock chroots and stuff. Only need to do this once. The only reason why this exists is because of limitations in Docker.<p>- build - builds Ruby binaries, given a runtime directory. It spawns a Docker container which performs the actual building. Inside the Docker container, it invokes the compiler, copies stuff around, etc.<p>Just follow the hello world tutorial and you&#x27;ll see how it works.",1418068971

I think that it would appeal to the HN community because the author, Robert Persig, arguably reaches a statement of enlightenment entirely through deductive reasoning. The story is essentially Persig&#x27;s attempt to piece this whole event together after having undergone electric shock therapy. The story unfolds as Persig and his son travel across the US by motorcycle and is complemented by intermediary &quot;chautauquas&quot; (philosophical monologues) and technical monologues about motorcycle maintenance. The book is an enigma (unlike its sequel &quot;Lila&quot; which is not), and there isn&#x27;t any other book that I&#x27;ve read that is like it.",1418068950

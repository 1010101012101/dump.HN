Many of these discussions occur in a vacuum, absent any considerations about how various externalities affect education.  At a minimum, consider examples like school lunches raising test scores because students aren't too hungry to concentrate.<p>Every problem a child has outside of school, shows up in the classroom as a barrier to learning.  If you want to revolutionize education, understanding that is a very good starting point.",1360522799

5197361,comment,5196666,5197172,7,0,betterunix,,,"I can remember many of my middle and high school teachers, both good and bad, with ""bad"" being a majority.<p>The best teacher I had was a middle school math teacher who realized that my problem was not a lack of understanding, and that expecting discipline from a 12 year old boy was folly.  She knew that my boredom was turning me in a distraction for the other boys in the class.  Her solution was brilliant:  she taught me material beyond what we were learning, and let me have at it.  I will never forget learning the square root algorithm from her, because it kept me occupied for weeks (my notebooks are filled with pages where I computed square roots of various numbers in various bases).<p>Sadly, she was a rare exception, not even remotely approaching the norm.  Most of my math teachers said that I should prove my talent by doing my homework, and told me that getting perfect marks on exams or otherwise demonstrating a well-developed understanding of the material was irrelevant if my homework was not being done.  My teachers were vehemently opposed to the idea of grades reflecting aptitude; it was unfair to students who needed to do their homework to understand the material, and it would be equally unfair to give one student more interesting homework instead of the standard ""busy work.""  If a bored student cuts class, and thus refrains from distracting other students, that is not acceptable either:  attendance is part of the grade and to be fair to everyone no exceptions can be made.  The only acceptable solution to a student who distracts others is <i>compliance</i> -- the student must be forced to obey and just be like everyone else.<p>I only barely got through the school system, despite having standardized math, reading, and writing scores of ""PHS"" -- post high-school.  I was once forced to attend summer school because of an ""F"" I received in an English class, where the teacher basically said that he thought I deserved to be there as punishment (but ultimately allowed me to skip his class to attend a summer science program, but only as long as I wrote a pair of $n page essays).  I was once threatened with being transferred to a high school with a violence problem if I did not start following orders.<p>So despite the fact that I come from a long line of teachers, I have difficulty believing that most teachers want to encourage creativity or curiosity among their students.  In my experience, teachers want to encourage compliance, and only accept creativity when it leads to specific results and behavior.  Curiosity seems to only be permissible <i>after</i> all instructions have been executed, and the teacher is free to give such a long list of instructions to follow that no compliant student could have time for creativity.",1360522674

I'd avoid Crockford's dogma for a while until it's clear to you naturally why you should follow those rules (and only loosely, he's pretty adamant about things that aren't useful or are counter productive in practice: <a href=""http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/jslint_com/message/3024"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/jslint_com/message/3024</a>).<p>Reading Flanagan's book is a good starting point. From there, as an experienced programmer, you might want more insight into the language and not just ""how to do A, B, and C""s, so I'd recommend after working in JS for a bit to skim through the ES5 spec and read up on the future of JS to somewhat future-proof your knowledge (ES6/Harmony, and you can already use some of those features in Firefox/Chrome/Node.js to get used to them). You might want to bookmark the annotated version of the spec, as it's a nice reference to make JS feel less like a strange Twilight Zone (<a href=""http://es5.github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://es5.github.com/</a>).<p>Experience should tell you that what's important isn't usually the language, as you pick that up fairly quickly, but in the libraries and APIs that exist in various environments. Every web developer should learn the DOM for instance (among many other APIs, notably those introduced with HTML5) and should be somewhat familiar with the popular JS libraries, at least feature-wise. I'd recommend anyone new to JS read through Backbone.js's code as it's a great example of how to write quality, readable code in JS. Outside of reading and contributing to libraries, there are quite a few to learn, so experiment/play with them, watch webcasts and read blog posts about them to get a feel for what people are using them for.<p>That extends to more than just the browser environment, there's also Node.js, Rhino, and surely a few others. If you're a Java developer, Rhino might be a nice way to use existing knowledge of the Java API and do things server-side, and Node.js is a bit different to get started with but is rapidly catching up to other languages in availability and quality of libraries (both pure JS and bindings in other languages).",1360522386

I thought ""I wonder what it would've been like to read this instead of how I did it, since everyone recommends it."" I think I'd recommend it to others, even people new to programming.<p>What's bad about really terse or difficult to follow books is that they densely pack information or lack explanation and that really inhibits learning. I find that K&R raises a lot of questions without leaving the reader unsatisfied or confused, which I think is the exact opposite -- if you're really interested, you'll use that as motivation to go learn more. You might not immediately see why language features are very valuable, but I think that improves for everyone as you learn more.",1360521803

It is super popular on homeschooling lists, even gifted homeschooling lists where people parrot this crapola like it is Gospel without ever engaging their brain. I figured it was kosher because it was repeated by so many smart, highly educated folk on elitist lists. (People who have been to big name colleges, like Harvard, some on scholarship because they were brainiacs.)<p>Then one day, on a forum unrelated to homescholling, I repeated the bit about how literacy rates used to be lots higher, before public school was instituted. I made an ass of myself. Yes, I have visited old ghost towns and seen the poor spelling conventions and other physical evidence of low general literacy. Yes, I used to be a history major and I know details like you used a pictorial sign for your tavern because so few people could read and that the purpose of church stained glass windows was to share some of the bible stories in pictorial form with the illiterate masses. I was taken in anyway, as are lots of very intelligent, educated folks.<p>Yes, I also know that there is a huge, important difference between a real education, which teaches you to think effectively, and mere training, which typically prepares you for a particular job. I have spoken of that many times. (FYI: ""liberal arts"" is designed to teach you to think. They are called that because they are supposed to be very freeing: If you can think effectively, you have much more genuine choice in life than the average person. Liberal Arts gets pissed on a lot as a really terrible thing to major in. And it may well be terrible, at a lot of schools. I don't really know. I think there is some truth to the idea that ""90% of everything is crap"".)<p>These days I find it questionable to quote anything by Gatto. The book was published with a hugely biased political agenda. The publishing house founder is a homeschooling crusader who would love to have public school abolished. For that matter, he would like to also have private school abolished. He would like homeschooling to be compulsory nationwide in the U.S. (if not globally).<p>That's a much more questionable agenda in my opinion than whatever agenda the powers that be had when they dreamed up public school.<p>(I homeschooled for many years. I think it can be a wonderful thing. But I see zero reason to believe that compulsory homeschooling would be inherently superior to what we do today. In the U.S. today, homeschoolers are generally rebels, defying the system in order to do right by their children. So they are typically very devoted parents. There is no reason to believe the excellence in education typical of homeschoolers today would remain the norm for homeschooling if it was the only avenue for getting a k-12 education.)",1360521694

5197209,comment,5196666,5196900,2,0,mdkess,,,"Can't we meet in the middle somehow?<p>I think that there is merit to rote learning. When I practice piano, most of the time I practice scales. Not creative at all - mind numbing, really, but fundamentally important. When I play a piece, it in theory the rote learning (ie. scales) gives me the dexterity and muscle memory to be creative within the piece of music.<p>I believe that this translates into education as well. I think it's important that people can do mental math quickly. I think that it's important that a computer scientist can implement merge sort or a min heap without having to resort to Wikipedia. They should be able to explain it too, naturally, but I think that the baseline of knowledge is required to be creative with more difficult problems.<p>I think that the important thing though, which music gets quite well yet academics mostly don't, is to separate the two. You practice scales, and mechanical exercises, so that you have the ability to be creative when playing the pieces. If they were more clearly separated, I think that it might be better, instead of confusing the two constantly. This is where I think the fear of failure comes from. With the mechanical side, failure is almost always bad. If you are not able to play the scale correctly, you haven't practiced enough - this is your own failing. With the creative side, failure is not necessarily bad, and success is not necessarily good. It's an experiment, an expression, and if it falls flat, you get knowledge from it, and if you're always succeeding, you're not pushing your limits. When the technical and creative get blurred, I think that it becomes natural to mistake the creative side as the technical side, and assume that failure is always bad.<p>My favourite course in school was computer graphics. The final assignment, worth 20% of your grade if I recall correctly, was this: ""Make something awesome with what you learned. You'll have 10-15 minutes to demo it to the professor. You have 3 weeks."" So you had better be darn comfortable with perspective transforms and normals and writing shaders, which you are, because you've built up that knowledge over the rest of the course. Now with it, you are given a platform to be creative. We were tested on the rote learning stuff - the exams required us to transform vectors and decompose matrices and write down lighting equations, but this was a test of ones creative ability. I think it's almost perfect in this regard, in getting a lot out of both worlds in a way that is focused and guided but not on rails.<p>I had friends who wouldn't take this course with me in school because they were worried that the courses would hurt their GPA.",1360520077

Even if I do find an adequate solution, it's not good enough until I can understand the class of problem and derive it for myself.<p>This also happens based on principle.  When I encounter a problem that is actually <i>solvable</i> -- though it may not matter much, then I must conquer it entirely.  As an example, for me it is unacceptable that something rated 5.0 with 1 review is ranked higher than a 4.9 with 10 reviews -- and I need to find the solution to this problem, even though it might only be a minor feature and won't matter if there are no reviews to begin with.<p>I call this ""conditional"" Rabbit Hole Syndrome.  It also sounds an awful lot like the classic interview answer: ""My biggest flaw is that I work too hard.""  Well it's true, damn it.  These types of trivial things can easily become my ""top idea"" for days at time.<p>I am now able to admit it:  <i>I spend time working on things that probably won't matter that much, and I enjoy it.</i>  But how do I fix this?  How do I learn to leave well enough alone?  How do I learn the distinction between frivolous research and actually getting shit done?<p>A couple of edits:  After more thought, this is really only an issue with work on my side projects.  I also think it's due to lack of accountability -- I report to myself.  As such, I tend to work on ""most interesting first"" and avoid schlep.  So I'm wondering: how do you motivate yourself to schlep?",1360519336

If at some point the median man smoked 20 cigarettes a day, and the median woman smoked 0, then lots of men will get lung cancer and women won't. If things change to 10 and 10, then the average number of cigarettes will stay the same, but the number of people who smoke at least 10 will have doubled. This is how the lung cancer rate can go up with the number of cigarettes going down.<p>Another way to measure it would be to look at ""how much lung cancer is there per smoker"".",1360519317

5197150,comment,5196890,5196890,14,0,philwelch,,,"So you just end up using function pointers and arrays to fake polymorphism. If you have the requirement that every part of a function has to be evaluated, you just end up branching between function calls rather than eliminating branching. This is vaguely reminiscent of how some functional languages use tail-recursion instead of loops--they don't eliminate iteration, they just express it a different way.<p>Where I disagree with the author is in pointing out that there is no real difference between declaring ""fib(1) -> 1"" in a pattern matching function definition and inserting a pointer to a function that returns 1 into an array of function pointers. Pattern matching and subtype polymorphism can even still get all the gains the author is looking for--namely, being able to debug branching by inspecting the call stack. For that matter, so would pushing a dummy stack frame every time you come to a branch, or even building a separate branch stack.",1360519270

As they stand, getting use out of web workers involves writing a series of messages and responses that are not standardized in any way between authors. The library I have created, Ozai, creates a web worker by passing a javascript object literal to its constructor. The result is a client-side object which represents the web worker. Instead of passing arbitrary messages, the author calls functions that are obvious to anyone reading the code, and passes them callbacks to fire when then web worker has completed its job.",1360519254

They don't sell a Go compiler or IDE or anything like that.  The whole this is open source and free.  Go for them is a project aimed at solving their own problems, and if it solves yours too, so be it.  With that in mind, your theory doesn't make a whole lot of sense.<p>As one of the people who does upvote the Go stories and has posted one myself, I think the real reason you see this is Go is an incredibly fun language to learn (at least if you're already a programmer, I can't speak for true neophytes) and the design of both the language and the API remind you about how much complexity you can get out of combining a few simple concepts.  After years of dealing with other people's 1000 line FactoryOfFactoriesFactory classes in Java, such simplicity is incredibly refreshing and it is difficult not to try to direct other programmers into taking a look.<p>IMO there's a lot of benefit to playing around with Go even if you end up not using it as a primary language and thus I plan to continue evangelizing it.",1360519228

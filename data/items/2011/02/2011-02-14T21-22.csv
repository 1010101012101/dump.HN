Instead, it should be on the vandals who want to destroy work.<p>Save your spin and lets stick to the issue. The simple answer is ""to maintain Wikipedia as an encyclopedic tome with a usable quality"".<p>If you wish to create a quality work of notable articles then it's necessary, IMO, to require an argument for inclusion rather than demand an argument to exclude something.<p>AFAIK no one is here to destroy worthwhile information, I certainly haven't contributed to Wikipedia to that end, but for some types of information Wikipedia is not the right place to put it. You'll see I linked to a wiki for programming languages, the info fits there well, it can be linked to from a Wikipedia page on more general programming information; why is it essential to duplicate such information?",1297720786

In the case of the US railroads, nationalization can arguably be seen as a disaster so there are mixed results of this.<p>It's a mixed bag all around, this one. The railroads in the US were killed, for the most part, by the Interstate Highway system, an equally nationalized endeavor. But really, they were doomed by geographic reality. Population density in the US is such that in most parts of the country a car is an absolute requirement for every working adult. And gas is cheap enough (relative to the rest of the world) that it's cost effective to rely on trucks and airplanes to move merchandise.<p>If you privatized Amtrak tomorrow, you'd still see full rail service up and down the Boston-NYC-DC corridor.

Unless you've read a good portion of his writings on language and cognition published through the last half century, you might not want to dismiss his life's work based on an off-the-cuff response to a random email prodding him for sound bites.<p>There are solid reasons to believe that purely empiricist approaches to learning have fundamental limitations that seem incompatible with what we know about human cognition. Those reasons (e.g. the poverty of the stimulus argument) may be less convincing now than they were in the 60s but they are still not easily dismissable. Keep in mind that Chomsky's goal is not to build useful software but to uncover the roots and mechanisms of human language and cognition.",1297720406

You can talk to a crowded room of programmers who either haven't heard of Scala, or have heard of it only in passing and don't really know what it's about. That's fine.<p>Programmers who are interested in learning and growing will always be attracted to new languages and technologies. What's interesting about Scala is that it's not solely academic. You can learn and do useful things with it at the same time. Later, when you've learned more, you can go back and improve your old code for added beauty and performance.

It then pays interest on those, yes. The Federal Reserve creates money, and then injects it by buying Treasuries (or, recently, MBS's and agency debt, I believe, as well).<p>The vast majority of Treasury notes, agency debt, MBS's, etc. are NOT held by the Federal Reserve. So the amount outstanding does not pose any significant constraint on the Federal Reserve's injection of money.<p>Even if /all/ outstanding Treasury debt were eliminated, that'd just mean the Fed would have to purchase other bonds.<p>Also, when the Federal Reserve buys Treasuries, it receives the interest payments. What does it do with that money? Well, it turns it over to the Treasury. (If you look at the Fed's annual reports, this is actually many billions) So the T-notes held by the Fed to inject the money essentially don't have interest paid on them, because the Treasury is paying the interest to itself, indirectly.",1297720127

Most people understand these things intuitively, so I would only point out your own blindness in certain aspects of social relations.<p>There have been many criticisms being leveled at your actions, but most of them—some correct, some incorrect—aren't important. Nor do your responses so far reveal any deep reflection of all that has transpired.

  wired according to the National Electric Code of the United

  neutrals, that the switches are standard-duty switches rated

2218720,comment,2217928,2217928,0,0,bugsy,,,"It's amazing that there are advantages to this. It seems the main one is the observation that intersections have many overloaded functions which combine to explode the complexity of operations that can occur: intersections handle cross traffic between roads, 4 different points of turning from one road to the orthogonal one via left turn, 4 different points of turning to orthogonal via right turn, four points of u-turns, and  pedestrian crossing. Whichever maneuver you pick, there are that many other maneuvers that each other car might be involved in at the same time and you have to interact with. That's an insane level of complexity, and the complexity of the whole system affects all the cars coming from each of 4 directions.<p>The Michigan turn takes roughly half of these, the 4 left turn modalities and 4 u-turn modalities and displaces each of 4 to a location where it only affects a single direction, the oncoming one, although it has the side effect of doubling the number of right hand turns at the main intersection, but these are safer turns than left ones.<p>A variation on this I have seen on highways and interstates throughout the US is to have a left turn slow down and two-way median turn around lane that is in between the actual roads where one would turn, ensuring that no dangerous left turns take place. The left turn is replaced with a u turn which is even more dangerous due to the lower speed at which one clears oncoming traffic, and there are seldom any pedestrian situations since pedestrians aren't usually found on highways. But it does avoid the otherwise conflict with negotiating the crossing with several other directions at once, to your right cross traffic, left cross traffic, left across-left turn traffic, right across-left turn traffic, and oncoming traffic, reducing all this to having to deal with oncoming traffic only.<p>And if I had not read this link I never would have thought about all this stuff, so thanks for posting.",1297718338

That does not include tutorials, blog posts, software's official website, or questions on support websites/forums.  These rules are unfortunate, and have been sources of much arguing, but they still stand.<p>We, as programmers, get upset when information that is useful to us is removed.  The rules exist for a reason, though; one place where they are often enforced is the addition of video game articles.  There are hundreds of thousands of video games with significant user bases.  Wikipedia has made it a point that it does not intend to be a catalog of software that exists, and for that reason video game articles are deleted often.  In order for software to legitimately qualify for an article, it must be significantly, demonstrably important.  Existence and popularity is not enough.<p>In response to the second type of argument: existence of violations does not justify other violations. If don't think the blue slime from Dragon Warrior deserves its own wikipedia page, mark it for deletion and argue your point, but don't reference it as why your bad article with weak references should remain.<p>Wikipedia has a LOT of articles that are against its rules.  We have become used to these, and depend on them, so we get upset when the rules are enforced.

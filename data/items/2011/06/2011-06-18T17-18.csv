2669112,comment,2668887,2669091,1,0,ckinni,,,"I agree, but I do think it seems to have a limited appeal within urban areas, then tunneling connections between server nodes in other cities over the regular internet.  The tunneling between cities is still vulnerable, but when it gets cut off there will still be a way of communicating.  The nice thing about this when localized to large urban areas is that the cost per capita shrinks.  I'd imagine it wouldn't be too expensive to set up a bunch of routers that weren't online.  Quick Google seems to suggest that a router tends to cost around $1-2 per month in electricity, plus an up front cost.  Create a Kleinrock ecosystem in a section of a city would not necessarily require a large number of people adopting it, but rather a manageable start up cost plus maintenance, which seems almost reasonable.<p>Of course, if a few people are paying for it, you'll still need people to actually use your wacky science project, which may or may not happen...

I am surprised it isn't higher.<p>First of all, Chrome's advertising campaign is immense. Chrome ads are plastered all over the web, including crucial places like google.com. Chrome is spending more on advertising than other browsers have available altogether.<p>Second, Chrome is a good product. Google has invested enormous resources into it, the kind that only an industry giant like Google, Apple and Microsoft can do, and the results are exactly as you would expect - good.<p>Third, we are also starting to see some special integration between Google web properties and Chrome, optimizations that appear only in that combination of browser+website. (Even if these are not proprietary protocols and so forth, Google still has an incredible advantage in the direct connection between the teams.) Leveraging Google's websites like that is a special advantage of Google that other browser makers do not have.<p>In summary, for these three reasons, I don't think Chrome's market share is surprising at all.

For example, because my parents had a median Silicon-valley income (which was above the national median), I did not get any financial aid, reasonable financing options, etc. My parents, limited by the mortgage payments to the house they bought in 2007 (bad timing, I know), had very little free cash (I had a little sister). As a result, I had to work for my money while there were supposedly poor classmates running around with Macbook Pros and brand new iPhones and iPads, paid for by their financial aid.

I've been following Y-combinator, techcrunch, and internet startups in general for a couple years now and I would consider this my ""passion."" However, with my major (Finance and Operations and Information Management) I find myself pressured towards the investment banking world. I know that might sound stupid. Yes I'm in college; I have my whole life ahead of me, but simply put I'm torn. It seems that Georgetown is an incubator for investment bankers, not budding entrepreneurs.
I have started my own company and have been an executive of another $16 million dollar (asset) company so I definitely have some experience, but the former I would not label as successful. In fact, I would label it as a failure for all the hours I put into it, and the meager output of cash flows. But I am very glad I did it because it has been the greatest learning experience of my life and I now know exactly what not to do (like bank on ads for a revenue stream). I have lots of really good ideas, and I have even narrowed down what my next venture would be, but I don't think I could do it on my own. I am definitely more of the business side and think my strengths include my networking ability, problem solving skills, and finance know how. I know a decent amount of php, html, css, javascript, sql, but I would think my time would be better well served on the business side.
Sorry for all of the ""stream of consciousness"" but I felt it would be helpful in answering my question.<p>Here is (finally) my question:<p>How do I find a partner? I think this might be one of the most important decisions of any entrepreneur, especially with my prior experience with a half-ass dedicated co-founder. More specifically, where should I look for a partner that is a developer? Unfortunately, not many (if any) of my friends fall under this category. 
Thanks for your advice and suggestions,
Chris",1308416437

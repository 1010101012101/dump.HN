I take care of myself every day and depression fades into the background allowing me to enjoy using the engineering bits of my brain in balance.  Getting enough sleep, eating well, drinking enough water, being grateful for what I have, exercise, and a community of friends have been key.  Nature walks, yoga, and Argentine Tango work for me.",1392260229

After all, there&#x27;s a reason why we used to tell people to log out when they&#x27;re done, although Google and Facebook are doing their damnedest to make people forget this ancient wisdom.<p>- There are many more opportunities for an attacker to reuse a stolen cookie.<p>- There are many more opportunities to exploit a CSRF vulnerability if users are always logged into the target site.<p>- Users might be under the impression that when they close the browser, they&#x27;ll be logged out. Breaking this expectation can have privacy implications. For this reason, I think it would be good to have a &quot;Keep me logged in&quot; checkbox, even if it is checked by default.<p>- Many people, especially the poor, still use computers that are either shared (with family and/or friends) or public (schools, libraries and Internet cafes).

Furthermore, QUIC doesn&#x27;t even have all of its feature set turned on, so these comparisons with unencrypted HTTP are, at best, premature. Also, comparing a single HTTP connection with a SPDY-like connection also misses the point.<p>We like UDP+PK crypto because it gives us zero latency connection setup times, allows mobile devices to change IPs without disrupting their connections, and for us, our average message size is 256 bytes (think: Twitter), and never over 1400 bytes, so every message we send has zero fragmentation.

I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s hard for friends to understand just how utterly <i>irrational</i> depression is. Being sad because something bad happened isn&#x27;t depression.

Mental health-related causes are personal to me as well.<p>I think you touched on one of the biggest issues: the stereotype that people with mental health problems appear different and have a lower social status. As your story illustrates, the conditions affect all sorts of people, including those who are smart, successful and career-oriented.<p>Many people fail to recognize the severity of psychological problems because they&#x27;re too busy looking at superficial measures of well being: a person&#x27;s career, his or her physical appearance, etc. But depression has made some of us feel as if we&#x27;re in a deep fog or a war zone, even if, on the surface, we live in nice neighborhoods and succeed in the workplace.<p>The key is to be more vocal about this struggle beneath the surface — and to speak up very soon. In my observation, the earlier in life a person can overcome depression, the greater his or her chances of becoming happy and stable.<p>Kudos on taking the initiative to speak up about this important issue and responding constructively to such as a great loss.",1392259889

My understanding is that when you interned a string you were given something like a constant token to reference it. This did two things:<p>1. Equality was trivial. Instead of taking to strings and comparing each character, it could just see if the constants were equal. For strings you know you&#x27;ll see often this could be great source of speedups.\n2. You could end up saving a ton of memory. Let&#x27;s say that string you&#x27;re interning is 250 character long. Instead of taking up 250 unicode characters plus overhead, it&#x27;s now... let&#x27;s say... 8 bytes. Maybe you saved a few hundred bytes.

9229606,comment,9227541,9227541,0,0,jbritton,,,"I have wondered why the eye stays elongated.  My quest for answers has been from dubious sources on the internet and so everything said below is suspect.  It is all based on reasoning and thoughts from potentially bad information.  \nI read that the eyeball is a sack filled with a viscous fluid, and therefore, its shape is determined by the eye muscles.  I determined the viscosity of the eye fluid is thicker than water, but less than motor oil.  The idea behind the eye muscles is that near work puts tension on the muscles and they stiffen up and thus elongate the eyeball.  So now I wonder why the eye muscles don&#x27;t relax.  Surely, a good night’s sleep or two would do the trick.  Could the eye muscles return to their proper position by not wearing my glasses and spending more time focusing on distant objects?  After about 3 years of experimenting with this thought, my vision has not improved.  But I work indoors in front a computer everyday with glasses on.  I have read the eyes muscles lack any counter force to pull the eyeball back into shape.  Perhaps the eyeball shell has grown deformed and it is stiff enough to hold the shape.  Maybe the eye socket determines the shape.  Maybe the eye muscles have nothing to do with the shape.  I would like to think that there is some corrective measure built into the eye system.  Otherwise, it would seem everybody&#x27;s eyes are on a one-way trip to becoming myopic and only the speed of this transition can be affected.  I know that for me, I wore my glasses all the time, even when I was reading.  Looking back, when I was first diagnosed, I really only needed them to play baseball at night under the lights.  I sort of wished that was the only time I wore them.  I wonder if my eyes could have corrected themselves.  Now it seems too late, because I need to wear them just to read a computer screen 18&quot; away.  I have also read that wearing glasses forces your eyes to focus at a close up distance.  So wearing glasses is like doing near work all the time and thus puts you on the fast track to becoming more myopic.  After all this rambling, I guess the real question is what is keeping the eyeball in the wrong shape?  If this were known, then maybe one could figure out how to fix the condition.  As a final note, I have also read that maybe the eye ball is not elongated, but that the cornea is not shaped correctly.",1426725848

That&#x27;s already what the math olympiad contests consist of.<p>No, I did just the opposite:  I said that\nothers proposed such materials;\nI did not propose them but criticized such\nproposals.  Again, for a high school\nstudent to be pushed into seeing\nlots of tricky things in Pascal&#x27;s\ntriangle, attacking number theory\nexercises, doing recreational math\nwon&#x27;t do the students much good in\nlater life -- so as in the title\nof this thread, we won&#x27;t expect to\nsee many such students successful in math\nlater in life.  Instead, the efforts\nthere in middle and high school will\nrarely come to anything.<p>Helping middle and high school students\ndo better in math than what is \nin just the usual courses would, could,\nand should be doable and done, but\nthe path is not recreational math, etc.\nbut, instead, as I outlined, just\nproceeding with the main line of\nmath education -- rush through the\nhigh school math of algebra and\ngeometry, likely also trig,\nand then get a college calculus\nbook and dig in.<p>E.g., the high school math\nteachers I had were eager to\nsay that we &quot;were not ready for\ncalculus&quot;.  Nonsense.  It was\nthe teachers who didn&#x27;t know\ncalculus.<p>I very much would\nhave rushed ahead had\nI had some good guidance.\nEventually I knew enough to rush ahead\nwhen I was \na college freshman:  I&#x27;d had\nfour years of math, grades 9-12,\nat a relatively good high school\nbut for my college freshman year\nwent to a state school that was\ncheap and close enough for me to walk\nthere and back.  They wouldn&#x27;t let\nme take calculus but pushed me into\na course beneath what I&#x27;d already done\nin high school.  So a girlfriend told\nme when the tests were, and I showed\nup for those.  The teacher said I\nwas the best math student he&#x27;d ever had --\nin no very real sense was I <i>his</i> student!<p>I asked to be permitted to start calculus\nbut was turned down.  So I got a good\nbook and dug in.  I did well (in high\nschool mostly I&#x27;d been teaching myself\nfrom the books and sleeping in class anyway).\nFor my sophomore year I went to a good\ncollege with an excellent college math\ndepartment, started on their sophomore\ncalculus, from the same text used at\nHarvard, and did well.<p>I&#x27;m hot on this stuff about what \nmiddle and high schools do to\ngood math students:  My eighth grade\narithmetic teacher gave me a D and\ntook me aside one on one and fervently\nurged me never to take anymore math.\nIn some significant ways, \nmy father was good at education\nand just laughed.<p>That eighth grade teacher\ndidn&#x27;t have a clue about what math was:\nFor the actual <i>math</i>, I&#x27;d done well\nin her class.  What I did poorly on was\nmultiplying two four digit numbers, and\nthe reasons were (1) my handwriting\nwas sloppy (common for boys), so sloppy\nI didn&#x27;t get the columns lined up and\nthen added wrong for the final answers,\n(2) my <i>clerical ability</i> was just awful\n(common for boys), (3) I understood the\nideas right away but never worked \non the <i>clerical</i> skills to\nget correct answers, (4) my parents\nnever urged me to work to get right\nanswers (my father had some\nhigh-end views of <i>education</i>\nand just wanted me to learn,\nespecially out of interest,\nand didn&#x27;t care at all about grades,\nand I did learn).<p>But in the ninth grade,\nthe teacher saw right away that\nI was his best student, and he sent\nme to the state math tournament.\nIn the summer after the 11th grade\nI was sent to an NSF math and physics\nprogram.<p>So, net, I was a good math student,\nwas very interested in math, was\neager to race ahead, but the school\ndid a poor job helping me.<p>There is a little more to the\nstory:  When the SATs came back,\nI was called out of study hall\nto get my scores, from the same\nteacher I&#x27;d had in the sixth grade.\nNice woman.  Sweet.  Ignorant!\nShe, along with most of the rest of\nthe teachers, thought I was \na dunce.  So, she read me \nthe Verbal SAT score -- 538.\nShe said &quot;Very good&quot;.  BS!\nIt sucked!  But she was sweet.\nShe may have thought that I would\nget 250 or some such!<p>Then she looked at my Math SAT\nand hesitated.  She looked \nworried.  Confused.  \nShe said\n&quot;There must be something wrong.&quot;\nThen she said\nthe score\nwas 752 and\n&quot;That&#x27;s uh, uh, very good.&quot;.\nDarned right it was good.\nBut she was correct that there\n&quot;was something wrong&quot; and had\nbeen for 4, 6, 12 long, \nwasteful, painful years.<p>I had had no idea what the SATs were\nabout and had made no effort to prepare.\nBut I finished the Math SAT early,\nchecked my answers, and still had\n15 minutes.  I&#x27;d <i>very</i> much like\nto know what the CEEB thought I&#x27;d\nmissed.  Maybe they <i>scaled</i> the\nscores and didn&#x27;t give anything much\nhigher.<p>My Math SAT was second out of a grad\nclass of about 180, which is about\nright from the statistics, 2.5 sigma\nabove the mean of 500.  The #1 guy\nbeat me by a few points.  The best\nstudent in the grad class was a little\nbehind me -- he went to MIT and\nburned out his fuses in his freshman\nyear.<p>I was a good math student, had been eager\nto rush ahead in math, physics, and chemistry,\nbut I&#x27;d had poor guidance.  So, I&#x27;m hot\non grades 6-12 continuing to give\ngood math students bad advice.  So,\nhere I say, mostly, for the actual\nMath Olympiad competitions, waste of time.\nTo do well with math, just go down the\nmain road to a ugrad math major as I outlined.\nSimple.  And to heck with,\nsay, learning to play Nim in\nCourant and Robbins, <i>What is Mathematics</i>,\nabout Pascal&#x27;s triangle, etc.<p>Yes, I&#x27;d learned about Pascal&#x27;s triangle.\nSo when I was in grad school and had\nbeen pushed into a silly ugrad class\nin probability, the prof went all\narrogant and emphasized that due to\nthe factorials it can take some\nreally long precision arithmetic\nto calculate even relatively ordinary\nbinomial coefficients.  BS:  Just\nwork in from one side of Pascal&#x27;s\ntriangle and never see a factorial.\nIndeed, I raised my hand and stated\nso in the lecture.  I&#x27;d long since\nwritten software do to just that.<p>Next he did a sloppy\njob explaining the glory of the central\nlimit theorem, and I dropped the course.\nBut I was taking and grading in the\nNeveu measure theory level course\nat the same time, my first official\ncourse in probability, and did well.\nE.g., I was the only student who showed\nthat there are no countably infinite\nsigma algebras.<p>The schools who want to send their\ngood math students to Math Olympiads\nare likely also doing a poor job\nhelping their students.  Then, as in\nthe title of this thread, in later\nlife we mostly won&#x27;t see much \neffect from such high school efforts.<p>Net, my hot button is that the \nschools in grades 6-12 don&#x27;t know\nenough math to do well helping\ntheir students eager to race ahead\nin math.<p>> > Good grief: Lots of people in middle and high school get pushed into math competitions such as the Math Olympiad but don&#x27;t go on to be math majors in college and grad school.<p>> This isn&#x27;t true at all.<p>Of course it&#x27;s true:  E.g., you\ngave some examples of how high school teachers\ntry to get some of their students into such\ncompetitions, i.e., &quot;push&quot; the students.\nThat&#x27;s <i>lots</i> of students, and\nin college math is not a very popular\nmajor.  So, lots of middle and high\nschool students in math competitions\ndon&#x27;t major in math in college, just\nas I claimed.<p>For more, you mentioned some activities\nat the college level; I was addressing the\nhigh school level.  Sure,\ncollege students who do well on the\nPutnam are likely college math\nmajors who are taking math very seriously.\nAgain, I was addressing high school.",1426725723

Program up the estimator in C and write an R interface, in which case the simulations will run 10 to 100 times faster. (Depending on the exact operations used.)

Program up the estimator and simulations in pure C, making it still faster but much more brittle.<p>This is a fairly iterative process -- I&#x27;ll typically discover errors in the math as I run the simulations or after I&#x27;ve run them, or the simulations will reveal unappealing properties that need to be fixed.

[For that matter, I also face these questions, just pitched a little differently]<p>I think I can summarize the existential angst into a single question: does everyone need to learn mathematics?<p>I waver on how I feel about this. On the one hand, the answer is clearly <i>no.</i> Not everyone needs to learn mathematics.<p>Recently, there was a post on HN that prompted discussion about whether or not going to college was necessary to achieve &quot;the American Dream.&quot; One of the higher comments also said <i>no.</i> But not going to college limits the paths one can take forward. This is parallel to my current thinking about general mathematics education.<p>Being innumerate is bad for personal development. Numeracy is required for many professions while innumeracy is targeted and taken advantage of by news makers and, for lack of a better word, propagandists.<p>That aside, this doesn&#x27;t actually answer the question of whether or not everyone should learn math. I suggest that there are reasons for everyone to become numerate. Becoming numerate in the American education system is thought of as a byproduct of the mathematical system. Learning the quadratic formula by rote does not contribute to numeracy. It seems plausible that having the mental faculty to understand its derivation does.<p>But I would also argue that becoming good at programming, physics, or chemistry (among others) also develops good numeracy. [I have thought about how &quot;critical thinking skills,&quot; to use a buzzword, relates to basic numeracy. There are many studies, and the Math Wars is a battlefield]. In physics and chemistry, the quadratic formula might arise in the process of understanding something else. It doesn&#x27;t bother me if a student sees a quadratic, knows there exists a formula to compute its roots, and then proceeds to look up/use this black box formula -- if the quadratic arose from good reasoning about some physical phenomenon (like finding orbits, or kinematics, or even making plans in games like KSP). To this, the author would reply that such a student is capable of understanding and perhaps even rederiving the quadratic formula on his or her own.<p>I suppose I could summarize my view by saying that I have conflicting thoughts on the merits for or against rote memorization in early mathematics... or for that matter calculus (which I&#x27;m currently teaching).",1426724742

When you move cursor up using the arrow key, the multiline S-expression automatically collapses, and the one above expands.<p>In any case, text editors need to be &quot;fully&quot; aware of the language, e.g., even if the editor does syntax highlighting, it is doing that based on the complete parsing cabability of the syntax, instead of just bunch of rules in editor&#x27;s script (like vimscript in vim).<p>It would also help if the source file is saved as an AST of the code, instead of raw code.

Clearly users will appreciate some features of their offering more than others; shooting for full-stack at launch both gets the company more feedback and allows them the most control over the initial relationship.<p>I totally agree that the full-stack offering can be rather off-putting, but the business side of DS still doesn&#x27;t understand how to reliably make money from this market.  Cloudera (and friends) have made money from a full-stack offering, so it&#x27;s easy try to imitate this success.<p>IMO the online IDE is very useful for expositions and small projects, but indeed a limiting playground for larger projects.

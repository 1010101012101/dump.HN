There&#x27;s even a toggle in your profile to see the posts of the damned. HN also seems to gratuitously hellban people - if someone isn&#x27;t hellbanned for being an obvious troll, sometimes they seem to be hellbanned over lightweight snark or nothing at all. HN even has its own notoriously hellbanned &quot;HN celebrity&quot;: the creator of Temple OS. It&#x27;s no secret.<p>Yet every day I notice hellbanned posts where the user has been hellbanned for some time now and they do not notice.<p>On my forum, I only hellban users so uncontroversially egregious (bots, spammers, and people who only post to pilfer value from the community) that nobody notices or would care if they did.<p>To &quot;expose&quot; the system, a user would pretty much have to create a topic like this: &quot;Hey everyone, you don&#x27;t know me because I&#x27;ve been trying to PM new users with links to my competing forum for half a year, but I just found out that nobody has been receiving my PMs because I&#x27;ve been hellbanned.

There was a case of a company producing a free sample of engineering work and then trying to reuse that elsewhere. The court decided the recipient of the work was the copyright owner and the company that produced it could not reuse it. Where was the payment?

9399127,comment,9399055,9399055,0,0,dsr_,,,"(If you know what the difference is between an amplifier and an attenuator, you should probably skip this comment.)<p>The point that the article tries to establish (and, IMHO, fails) is that there are two things going on:<p>S: The signal that comes in.<p>V: The perceived volume that reaches your ear after the signal is decoded, amplified, and transduced by speakers.<p>S influences V, but so does the volume control on your TV or receiver, the efficiency of your speakers, and how far away you are. The fact that S and V are different is what allows your TV station to claim with a straight face that the perception of sound is not under their control. But they&#x27;re also lying, because...<p>TV stations take content from many sources (local commercials, network commercials, local programming, network programming) and while they probably pass the network stuff straight through, they still have to adjust the level of everything else so that it is not too distractingly different from what the network feed. Local advertisers will complain vociferously if Billy Bob Auto&#x27;s 35 seconds of dancing cheerleaders clustered up around old Billy Bob himself is a smidge quieter than Jesse Ventura&#x27;s minigun chopping down trees in the edited-for-TV rerun of Predator that just went to commercial break.<p>So they run all the sources through compressors, expanders and limiters to get a more or less equalized top output volume. The sources have all been produced with this expectation, so we have the exact same loudness war that has been mentioned on HN recently, only on TV instead of on CD and FM and MP3.<p>In the end, you get problems at every commercial break where the program has lots of dynamics and ends on a quiet bit. The &quot;normal&quot; Billy Bob Auto ad wouldn&#x27;t sound so loud if it had happened right after the car chase.",1429358079
9399125,comment,9396409,9399071,0,0,mbrock,,,"I see your point. Moral philosophy and real life aren&#x27;t separable in a clear-cut way, though. This conversation isn&#x27;t about judging whether individual actions by people in extreme situations involving violence are right or wrong. It&#x27;s about the ideas, emotions, and structures that surround those situations.<p>Let&#x27;s take another example. Consider the moral injunction &quot;don&#x27;t steal,&quot; and the ethical/philosophical idea &quot;stealing is wrong.&quot; These are quite basic, definitely not outlandish. Yet there are many situations where stealing is necessary for one&#x27;s survival[1] and therefore proper.<p>Someone discussing the ethics of theft could well be accused of lofty idealism because of the existence of emergency situations wherein theft are necessary. But I think such examples don&#x27;t completely invalidate the moral prohibition against stealing; they only show that nuance is required.<p>This conversation started as a discussion of male conditioning, the culture of male violence, and how that relates to bullying at an early age. That&#x27;s a larger scale than individual incidences of bullying.<p>The &quot;utopian&quot; idea of nonviolence, for example as expressed in my <i>Dhammapada</i> quote, isn&#x27;t primarily saying that kids should be scolded for hitting back. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more relevant to how parents, perhaps especially fathers, should talk about such violence. The hypothetical parent who cheers on the bullied kid when he/she hits back may be propagating values that are not beneficial.<p>[1]: Even such a strict property ethicist as Ayn Rand wrote about this in an essay called &quot;The Ethics of Emergencies.&quot;",1429358058

Even if a bit tedious to implement at first, it meshes very well with multi-user web apps, when several people may be changing the same underlying data simultaneously.<p>One possible approach is carry in POST both old (original) state and new (user input) state, and apply it as a diff to underlying storage.<p>Used this approach with 100% success on WWW based kiosks used by tradesmen, some of whom were habitual doubleclickers. Since the form was very simple -- one or two fields -- the old state was carried in action url. In case of double clicks, the seconds ended up changing nothing in backend storage, and returning correct data.",1429354953

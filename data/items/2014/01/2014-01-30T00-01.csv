Sure, they have some control over their workers, but that only gets you so far.  Unless the manager has real control up, as well, they can only be so good.  This is especially so on projects that are likely in a death spiral.<p>Worse, though, is that many &quot;good&quot; managers probably don&#x27;t have a real idea on exactly what makes them good.

For example, in one case a court recognized that a correction officer&#x27;s refusal to cooperate with the defendant&#x27;s practice of allowing white but not black inmates to shower after work shifts constituted protected opposition.  Even if the inmates were not &quot;employees,&quot; the plaintiff could show that his enforcement of the policy made race discrimination a term or condition of his employment.  Thus, his refusal to obey the order constituted  opposition to an unlawful employment practice.<p>In short, if someone in good faith protests about what appears to be illegal workplace discrimination based on national origin, and that person is fired shortly thereafter, then the company has the burden to show that it firing wasn&#x27;t an illegal form of retaliation.<p>The comment &quot;without going through the normal termination procedures used by Oracle&quot; is there as suggestive that this firing was a form of retaliation.<p>I don&#x27;t think people know enough about EEOC law to know what their rights are in the workplace.",1391042365

Maybe the reason our economy is so screwed up right now is because employees are getting a smaller and smaller share of the pie, not because technology is displacing jobs.

The Chromecast isn&#x27;t a standalone device.  Period.  Full stop.  It&#x27;s basically a mildly improved AirPlay device that still lacks many features (even in the way of AirPlay).  Off the top of my head:<p>1.  The streaming isn&#x27;t system wide.  Developers need to incorporate the streaming ability into their apps whereas Apple has it builtin to the device.\n2.  My parents are unable to understand the concept of &quot;flinging&quot; content; they want it to be a DVR-like device.  The AppleTV allows them to rent, purchase, or view previously obtained iTunes content.  \n3.  Music sounds terrible through it.  It lacks an optical audio out port so it just uses the TVs speakers which are obviously not great.\n4.  This is probably a personal issue, but Chrome tab streaming constantly drops out after a short period of time.  I&#x27;ve yet to get it working fully.\n5.  AppleTV can support games being flung to the TV while using the iDevice as a controller.  This isn&#x27;t a selling point, but I&#x27;d like my N5 to do the same.\n6.  My TV (while being a 40&quot; 1080p flat screen) is lacking a USB port so I do have to plug it in.\n7.  Am I missing where I can stream my Android device&#x27;s OS on the screen?

They take years, are very stressful, and you generally need significant up-front capital to make them happen. Then if (if!) you win a lawsuit the cash doesn&#x27;t magically appear when the judge bangs his gavel; there&#x27;s a whole process for trying to extract your money. And if they have spent the money and are now broke? Well, basically, tough shit.<p>And of course, winning a lawsuit and recovering money doesn&#x27;t actually turn back the clock on the lost time and heartache. It just means you&#x27;ve managed to get some of your cash back. Which may feel like a very poor return, and is certainly a waste.<p>And that&#x27;s even before we get to the various theoretical reasons that regulation makes sense here. For example, there&#x27;s an information asymmetry: these instant schools know a ton more about what they&#x27;re selling than their customers do, making it much easier for them to exploit. Plus they&#x27;re selling training; students, by definition, are missing a lot of important knowledge and are outsiders to the industry. The normal feedback loops of commerce work best with repeat purchases; one-time purchases greatly restrict the invisible hand&#x27;s power. And if nothing else, we need a regulator to make sure that the statistics are solid.<p>As somebody who has hired developers in CA and will likely do so again, I think this is great.

Such is the nature of percentages.<p><i>> therefore, if you get hit by something that will actually make a difference, it&#x27;s not going to be within 12%. it&#x27;s going to be like 12,000%. so, it&#x27;s not going to make a whit of difference at that point whether you have httpd.conf or .htaccess.</i><p>I manage a data centre for a number of high profile sites. If I can improve throughput by 12% then that means I need one less server in the farm. It means less strain on the db as connections are clearing down quicker. And it also means the likelihood of visitors hitting &#x27;refresh&#x27; due to slow load times is reduced, which in turns slows the exponential growth that happens shortly before a site buckles. So trust me when I say 12% does matter if you&#x27;re building busy sites - I know this because I wouldn&#x27;t be doing my day job properly if I didn&#x27;t load test this stuff and implement any free optimisations I can.<p><i>> i&#x27;m just saying, if you&#x27;ve got access to httpd.conf, you&#x27;ve got the whole server. that means you&#x27;ve probably got bigger fish to fry as to worrying about security than a pretty harmless, defaulted as secure, .htaccess file.</i><p>Yes, I&#x27;d already said the former point myself, however your latter point is still ignoring the simple fact that you don&#x27;t need to be root to edit a .htaccess file. I repeat, you do /NOT/ need to be root to edit a .htaccess file!<p>Someone can edit your .htaccess file even when they don&#x27;t have permissions to edit httpd.conf (and thus ssh_config nor anything else in /etc nor other root-owned config hierarchies). Thus if your http docs are writeable (and they typically are for personally web servers as you don&#x27;t have a dedicated network storage such as a SAN shared across your web servers, so your content is stored on the web server itself) then a bug in your website could allow an attacker access to write to the disk in the web docs directory. In short, attackers could create and edit their own .htaccess files.<p>We&#x27;re not talking about root access here, these are not attacks that have permissions to write to httpd.conf; we&#x27;re talking about a http-owned (eg &#x27;www-data&#x27; on Debian) users who shouldn&#x27;t have ability to write files having that ability to edit the Apache config because .htaccess is not typically root owned.<p>If you want the convenience of a .htaccess file but the security of a httpd.conf, then change all your .htaccess files to be root owned:<p><pre><code>    sudo find / -name &quot;.htaccess&quot; -exec chown root:root {} \\; -exec chmod 644 {} \\; -print</code></pre>",1391040178

4763033,comment,4760445,4762926,1,0,mistercow,,,"It doesn't solve the piracy ""problem"", but it does mitigate it somewhat, and it prevents file sharing. Piracy is still very simple for SaaS. It's just a matter of sharing an account between multiple users. That's easy to detect on a large scale, but basically impossible to reliably detect when it's just between a couple of friends. And once you start trying to detect and prevent the latter case, the solution stops being so neat after all.<p>A better solution is to make sure that there is significant value for a user having her own, personal account.

In the early 2000s, it was usual for sites to be IE-only, or to be horribly broken in any alternative browser. It seems to me that the rise of popularity of Firefox correlated strongly with a drop in these IE-only sites, and I don't think that its unfair to label it as a dominant cause of this drop. Even if Firefox dies completely and leaves behind only Chrome, Safari, Opera and IE in its wake, I think it's still fair to call it a great victory for open standards and open source.",1352473098

I use Stripe first and foremost as a best-in-class one-time payment processor.

If they try to stamp out all of those edge cases, they will inevitably break someone else's application that relies on a slightly different interpretation of ""the way things are supposed to be"".<p>I sincerely hope that Stripe continues to say No to feature requests far into the future. Where does PDF invoice generation (with HTML templates of course) fit into ""the simplest thing that works""? When Stripe notifies you of a sale, generate your own invoice.

His daughter is in debt $60k for a degree in theater. Did well in college, but wants to ""make it"" in NYC.<p>Now obviously the theater industry is very competitive, especially in NYC. So while trying to do various theatrical activities to get her foot in the door, she's a dog walker. She doesn't make much money, so she's qualifying for assistance.<p>She could move back home, get a job in a different field (her dad has lined up several paying jobs), but she wants to stay in NYC. She's unable to make any payments on her loans, so those are going to build up quickly.<p>This is what drives fiscal conservatives crazy. And when groups are asking for student loan debt forgiveness/bailout, it's doubly frustrating.

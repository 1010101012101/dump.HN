Maybe the market can fund one entrant but if there are two, and the market share is divided, there&#x27;s not enough money for each player to cover their costs.<p>A systematic fix would look like one of:<p><pre><code>    - Restrict entry to a single player (patents)\n    - Provide matching funds for each sale\n</code></pre>\nThese fixes apply to this specific situation. We&#x27;re talking about the space program, so we&#x27;re talking large up-front capital costs, which means its possible the situation exists. The patent system is clearly cheaper up front, though the more expensive second option ensures at least some competition, making for an overall better product, but at a very high price.",1449374204

If you are reading the commit log, there shouldn&#x27;t be any surprises as to what a particular commit actually changes when applied. If you have a lot of uncommitted changes, remember that you don&#x27;t have to add them all at once -- use &#x27;git add file1 file2&#x27; and make descriptive messages for each change. Also remember that you can &#x27;rebase --interactive&#x27; to fix up your commits locally if you want (don&#x27;t rebase shared/pushed history, though).",1449374116

So Porche could very well &quot;beat&quot; Tesla, simply with a larger production capability.\nAnyway, that&#x27;s all good for us and even for Tesla as it grows the market.<p>What other brand can do to Tesla is forcing them to chose their target market. Either they step up against Porsche as a luxury brand. There is plenty of room in the market for load of constructor - see the current market for reference. Or go for the premium market (i.e. what they are mostly, even if slightly expensive ), which is actually quite a good market (BMW Serie 3/5, ...) but they will need to seriously ramp up their production.",1449373798

A duck-billed platypus is not a duck.<p>Yes, you can write R code in a functional style in places when convenient, but one floor down it&#x27;s still running that loop you didn&#x27;t want to see. It&#x27;s a language based on mutable values and sequential execution and looping, not pure function calls and recursion. The syntax itself is very much sequential, unlike stereotypical FPLs. Even the lexical scoping design relies fundamentally on mutable environments. So yes, people do seem to enjoy proudly declaring R a FPL citing a few features, but as I said, those features make R as much a FPL as Python.",1449373770

Kevin Verstrepen, Stijn Mertens and collaborators at VIB laboratory for Systems Biology in Leuven showed with genetic studies that most lager fermentation results from a hybrid species of two parent yeasts—Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and S. eubayanus. Because these two species are so different, crossing them to make more diverse lagers has been unsuccessful. At least, so far. The researchers describe how they optimized growing conditions to foster mating between the two yeasts, which resulted in hundreds of new lager strains (Appl. Environ. Microbiol., doi:10.1128/AEM.02464-15, 25 September 2015). Of the 31 they tested in small-scale beer fermentors, only 10 performed well in terms of fermentation speed and flavor. Two, in particular, fermented even faster and produced novel aroma profiles compared with commercially available lager yeasts.",1449373491

Can&#x27;t tell the difference between a Model T and a current Chevy SUV.  Instead, just look at really simple, crude, external things and ignore the complicated, internal, crucial, core things.  Like trying to learn how to build a rocket to go to Mars by watching all the episodes of <i>Star Trek</i> or all movies of <i>Star Wars</i>.  Like trying to learn auto engineering by watching NASCAR races on TV.<p>Silicon Valley has managed to get by with this view from 100,000 feet because of some special considerations, but in general for engineering, applied research, and advanced technology that 100,000 foot view doesn&#x27;t work.

Nothing else looks bad.<p>There are several founders, each male, each with a pregnant wife.  The founders are desperate for some cash and are eager to sign a term sheet with some really onerous terms, things like claw backs, cram downs, liquidity preferences, pro rata rights, with four year vesting of the stock by the founders, and where the BoD is dominated by the venture investors and can fire anyone in the company for any reason or no reason before their stock is vested.

Since mixing up the languages would be noticed quickly, perhaps that&#x27;s how I learned to keep them separately better than most?

In fact, it was never recognized until all-to-predictable 5-4 decision in 2010[1].<p>You are wrong about this.<p>Please read District of Columbia v. Heller in full (2008). It reviews the history, with ample explanation of the meaning, phrasing, and expectations elucidated through founding-era sources. Please see section D, which has an extensive discussion of how this right was discussed in the 19th century. Upon reviewing the evidence, the court concludes:<p>> It was plainly the understanding in the post-Civil War Congress that the Second Amendment protected an individual right to use arms for self-defense.<p>There is significant evidence in the way of commentary, court opinions, legislation, etc. justifying that the right was understood as an individual right throughout this time:<p>> In Nunn v. State, 1Ga. 243, 251 (1846), the Georgia Supreme Court construed the Second Amendment as protecting the “natural right of self-defence” and therefore struck down a ban on carrying pistols openly. Its opinion perfectly captured the way in which the operative clause of the Second Amendment furthers the purpose announced in the prefatory clause, in continuity with the English right:<p>> “The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, and not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law which contravenes this right, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void [...]”<p>> Likewise, in State v. Chandler, 5La. Ann. 489, 490 (1850), the Louisiana Supreme Court held that citizens had a right to carry arms openly: “This is the right guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States [...].”<p>Lastly, you misconstrue the nature of the 5-4 decision. Two years earlier, in 2008, the same justices as who you are referring to also dissented in Columbia v. Heller, and wrote:<p>> #1. Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting. The question presented by this case is not whether the Second Amendment protects a “collective right” or an “individual right.” Surely it protects a right that can be enforced by individuals.<p>> #2. Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting. I take as a starting point the following four propositions, based on our precedent and today’s opinions, to which I believe the entire Court subscribes: (1) The Amendment protects an “individual” right—i.e., one that is separately possessed, and may be separately enforced, by each person on whom it is conferred. [...] I shall, as I said, assume with the majority that the Amendment, in addition to furthering a militia-related purpose, also furthers an interest in possessing guns for purposes of self-defense, at least to some degree.<p>Even the dissenting votes agree that the right to bear arms individually for self-defense is a right protected by the Second Amendment, at least to some degree. Their dissenting votes are based on a disagreement about the <i>scope</i> of that protection, and how it interacts with competing interests in those cases. The dissent involves questions like whether the Second Amendment is incorporated by the due process clause.",1449372121

There they showed off Revis, a react library for making charts and visualizations that looked really interesting, with the selling point being that it enables you to create graphs declaratively. They said they had plans of open sourcing it, although they didn&#x27;t give a due date.<p>Another thing they indirectly showed off was a reactjs playground which was very similar to swift playgrounds. I say indirectly, because the person that was presenting was showing revis using it. There&#x27;s some public playground components that are around (e.g. component-playground [0]), but it&#x27;s the type of thing where I think there&#x27;s still room to experiment and innovate. Bret Victor&#x27;s Inventing on Principle video [1] comes to mind.<p>I don&#x27;t know how big the web presence at Apple has been in the last few years, but I&#x27;m hopeful that this is a sign that it&#x27;s growing and that it&#x27;ll push more resources to the Safari team so it&#x27;ll keep up better with other browser vendors.

Let&#x27;s talk through this with an example, not drawn from programming: let&#x27;s talk about stopping actual bullets. When Operation Iraqi Freedom started, US troops were issued flak jackets, which do what they suggest - catch flak, i.e. shrapnel from bombs. They were not, despite what one might think, bulletproof vests. As OIF continued on, as forces transitioned from fighting conventional forces to fighting insurgency, it was decided that actual bulletproofing was required. So everyone was issued ceramic plates that inserted into the front and rear of the flak jacket. They were ceramic, unlike the metal plating on an armored vehicle, because as it turns out, simply stopping a bullet that&#x27;s going at over 2,000 feet per second is a great way to break a ribcage. So the ceramic plates are designed to shatter on impact, spreading the force of impact over a larger surface area. Bulletproofing a person is a different task than bulletproofing a tank. And there are downsides to bulletproofing a person - they can&#x27;t run as fast with 15 poinds of antiballistic ceramic strapped to them, and it turns out that ceramic doesn&#x27;t breathe as well as, say, cotton. So your bulletproofed servicemember is now more vulnerable to heatstroke, which is a real problem in Iraq in the summer, when daytime temps can routinely exceed 120 degrees.<p>Bulletproofing, either in the literal or the metaphorical sense, is a series of tradeoffs and compromises. The idea that there&#x27;s one right set of compromises for every HTTP server out there, not just in terms of safety but in a myriad of design decisions, is simply wrong.",1449371220

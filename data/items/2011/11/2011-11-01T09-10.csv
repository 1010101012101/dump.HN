The internet's user base has expanded so much, especially in the last decade, that formal names are no longer marketable for a lot of different purposes. They will appear boring and dull.  Increasingly, the trend on the internet is to entice potential users with relatively fast paced, easily understood branding. Anything other than a short name will be lost from memory amidst a sea of shirter, more poignant and imaginative names (which often ride on the value of their recognition than pragmatism).",1320141595

I care about antitrust violations, or data privacy violations. If New York requires hotels to be licensed - which I think is a fair requirement - then I don't see why Airbnb patrons should be exempt from that law. This view will probably be unpopular on HN.<p>I don't suggest that the US government stop ""harassing"" startups because ... they're startups, and economy economy economy.<p>I think you need to find a way to spur wealth creation while still having some rule of law in the country.

Because a programmer in Japan is someone that takes a spec or a task, written by an engineer, and ""translate"" it into code. A programmer doesn't solve any problem, he implements another person solution, and that's it.<p>But at the end of the day it's not strictly about semantics, I think it's also about how you understand you work.

Startups can only become massively successful by stealing market share from established companies. As you've stated, this has the effect of angering the cozy quid pro quo relationship between established companies and governments.<p>The root of this problem lies in the inevitable merger of the corporate and political classes. As the lines between these two entities blur, disruption through innovation will increasingly be hindered by new legislation.

Specifically, they use term 'experiential name' for names that hint or evoke an idea what the product does, but reserve term 'evocative' for positioning. Virgin is a prime example of evocative name, while e.g. Infoseek is a experiential name.<p>A quote from the manual:<p><i>One important way that evocative names differ from others is that they evoke the positioning of a company or product, rather than describing a function or a direct 
experience</i><p>The guide also highlights how there can be initial resistance for great (evocative) names. For example, consider Virgin Airlines:<p>""But public wants airlines to be experienced, safe and professional!"" or<p>""Religious people will be offended""<p>Or Caterpillar:<p>""Tiny, creepy-crawly bug"",<p>""Not macho enough  easy to squash"",<p>""Why not ""bull"" or ""workhorse"" ""?<p>It's a great read.",1320139170

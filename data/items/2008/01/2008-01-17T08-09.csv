99698,comment,99662,99662,0,0,__,,,"Interesting point at the end about the inverse correlation between means-value and ends-value.  But I'm not sure I buy it.  Health and human rights seem to have more means-value than Rosling gives them credit for.<p>Even an exploitative factory owner wants workers to be somewhat healthy so that he can hire lots of them, and so that there will be more competition between prospective workers (which keeps wages down).  And human rights seem like a prerequisite for maximizing a society's creative output.  I suppose frightened and brutalized people can do agricultural or factory work, but I doubt they can do great physics.",1200558865

99691,comment,98770,99580,0,0,boucher,,,"You've gone from complaining that the device has super compressed 720p which won't be as good as blue-ray, to claiming that you don't really know what it will look like, but that any compression on 720p video will look worse than uncompressed 1080p.<p>The facts on blue-ray:
""Discs encoded in MPEG-2 video typically limit content producers to around two hours of high-definition content on a single-layer (25 GB) BD-ROM. The more advanced video codecs (VC-1 and H.264) typically achieve a video runtime twice that of MPEG-2, with comparable quality.""<p>In all likelihood, iTunes is using H.264, or their newest variant.  The same as blue-ray.  So, in reality, the choice of codec matters a great deal, blue-ray is not uncompressed video (thus, 25GB holds a 2 hour compressed movie), and yes, 1080p is better than 720p.<p>And it's also worth noting that digital cable, and as far as I know every other on demand HD video service, is also ""highly compressed"" 720p.",1200557424

That way if I want to to write software just for looking at my servers and making more mongrels, i can, very easily.  Otherwise i have to look in mongrel's code.",1200557346

875168,comment,874902,875070,0,0,lionhearted,,,"The problem is the word ""capitalism"" - it implies just for-profit enterprises. But capitalism is really just how Marx branded ""free enterprise.""<p>> Therefore if you want to have clean water supplies, universal education, national defense, police, unproductive people not starving in the streets, etc then you need to divert some resources away from capitalism.<p>Capitalism - free enterprise - handles all of those pretty well except national defense and maybe policing. Charities are part of capitalism. Infrastructure's not so bad for government to build. In wealthy countries, charities vastly outperform government in alms and welfare because it doesn't create power structures that people try to hijack and lobby.<p>As for government in education, it corrupts education completely. Look at the standard American middle school and high school curriculum - very little of practically important things (scheduling, personal finance, establishing habits, interpersonal skills, critical thinking, problem solving), and a lot of nonsense. They teach algebra fairly well in American high school and almost nothing else. I can't believe that any educator would be in favor of government-run education: It sinks to a very low level, teachers are handcuffed by bureaucrats and public opinion in their teaching methods, honest perspectives on history, ethics, and civics become impossible to learn, bad teachers don't get fired, good teachers with non-traditional backgrounds don't get hired... like, government doing a lot of stuff is a relatively new idea, and it's a nice idea, but it usually doesn't work so well in practice.",1255291125

In the first you will be supported unlimitedly by your family tribe, so you generally maximize the number of relatives. The second one (feudal, socialist) there is a small special group instituting an arbitrary distribution (may be good or bad, historically mostly bad). In that setup head-count of the whole economy in general is maximized, and that is why people would not be allowed to travel if they were serfs or living in socialist countries. Thirdly, there is capitalism, which leaves everyone on his own, expecting him to live off his own possessions and produce. And in that system, clearly property maximization is the way to wealth.<p>For me, with this basic distinction, everything fell into place.

Capitalism <i>acknowledges</i> greed, and builds a system that can survive and bring virtue in spite of it, and to some extent, because of it.<p>While it's OK to decry greed, it isn't OK to build an economic system based on the idea that people aren't greedy. They are. There are billions of year of history behind the greed of humanity, and I'm not exaggerating. If you build an economic system based on something that is, fundamentally, not human, you will get bad results.<p>That's where other systems tend to fall down, and why for all the ""failures"" of capitalism, the worst off in a modern capitalistic society is better than all but the best off in almost any other society.<p>I'm willing to listen to other economic systems that also acknowledge greed. I recommend the book ""Accelerando"" for a half-decent exploration of the question of whether there is something better once you have pervasive computerization. But the solution to the problem of greed isn't trying to build a system based on the belief that there is some way to make people not greedy.<p>Greed is not capitalism's fault. Greed is, ultimately, traceable back to the fact that for every live form that survive to reproduce, there are thousands that don't. Greed may look odd in the incredibly, utterly strange place we currently find ourselves in where we have more resources than we know what to do with, but this is the strangeness, not greed.<p>I'm pretty skeptical of every other system I've ever seen, including socialism and communism, because they are basically built on the idea that we'll take control away from the greedy, shortsighted people and give it to the enlightened, ungreedy ones who will run things better. There is of course the (perfectly correct) argument that the information flow of such a system can't be made to work with the tools we have, but there is also the even-more-fundamental problem that the ""enlightened, ungreedy"" class of people <i>doesn't exist</i>. There are only people <i>claiming</i> to be the enlightened, ungreedy class. Until you can build a non-capitalist system that isn't based on this fundamental failure, it's not going to do well.<p>(That said, I'm only a little-l libertarian and I acknowledge that the government does have a place. I'm talking economic system here, not whole society system. Just as capitalism harnesses greed, instead of denying it, a government should harness capitalism, instead of denying it.)",1255287625

4956477,comment,4956198,4956198,2,0,mmahemoff,,,"This begs the question, which textbooks do include or at least address real-world code?<p>The closest I can recall are those with heavy emphasis on refactoring, because gradually moving from bad to good is usually the best one can hope for in the real world. I'm thinking in particular of Bob Martin's Agile Software Development, because I liked how he made the point in the book that he didn't just arrive at this beautiful code, but achieved it through TDD and refactoring.<p>I think ""bad code"" is actually what the most talented developers excel at (see also Duct Tape Programming <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html</a>).

4956476,comment,4955536,4955536,8,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The GoPro is an excellent example of how product design can be hindered by an excessive feature list. The conventional wisdom is that consumers always want more features and removing features or failing to support the features your competition does is a recipe for business suicide. But the truth is that often times some features are not necessary and supporting them can serve as a roadblock toward developing other features or improving the core meta-features (usability, performance, robustness, cost, etc.) GoPro was smart enough to realize that there is a huge market for a camera which is not a jack of all trades, which is optimized to be compact, light, super easy to use, good for action shots or establishment shots and also inexpensive but not necessarily good for still photography, portraits, close-ups, low-light shots, etc. By making those compromises they were able to create a product that excelled in its niche, cemented its brand name, and destroyed the competition.<p>If you want to learn how to disrupt existing industries and build billion dollar companies from nothing, there are few better examples.",1356181087

4956471,comment,4956198,4956198,1,0,kris_lander,,,"The problem highlighted by this article and the ensuing debate here is that most people in our industry (management and developers alike) talk about good code and bad code in purely subjective terms. Until we learn to talk objectively about the systems we build (where code is just one part of that system) in terms of function (what a system needs to do), \nperformance (how ""good"" the system has to do the functions) and economics (the resource constraints in building the system) - you know, like proper engineers do, we'll never move forward. The ugly truth is that would appear that most banking systems are ""good enough"" - i.e. they are competitive in the environment operate in - despite the horrors that undoubtably exist in their implementation. I see a lot of talk about the consequences of ""bad code"" but few have the evidence to back it up. It is our responsibility as engineers to measure the performance of our systems in the _right_ way so it becomes painfully obvious where we should focus our efforts to improve things.",1356180899

It's actually one of the reasons I love Haskell so much. I've been where you are though, and I feel your pain - if you keep at it, it'll get good, promise.<p>Some things I find help with maintainance : * the type system allows the compiler do a lot of work for you, * types have to be concrete rather than abstract, * if a little effort is applied the unit tests can be amazing, * everything's clearly defined, * codebases tend to be a bit smaller, and once you're used to it, more readable.<p>In the particular situation you describe, maybe using the ""take"" function could work?<p>Yes, the IO stuff can be tricky, I agree, but with practise it's not too bad, and separating IO from pure code gives all sorts of goodness back. There's always Debug.Trace if you need to do a quick bit of debugging by print statements.<p>I feel the article was being unfair on Haskell there, after all the code example was being deliberately unreadable, and that's possible in any language.<p>It's not really that hard:<p>map (2^) [1..]",1356180819

4956457,comment,4955344,4956342,3,0,shod,,,"I recently bought a new TV, and out of excitement left it uncalibrated. First film we watched was live action, which I don't watch much of, and it looked fine to me. The second film was anime, which I watch a lot, and I could tell that something was wrong: characters seemed to morph rather than move, like a bad Flash animation, and quick movements like mouths during speech seemed to lack their usual snappiness. It was only then that I started futzing with calibration settings and realized interpolation was a default. While researching afterwards, I found that people watch more live action than cartoons have a very different experience -- when cartoons were mentioned, it was often to say that motion interpolation looks fine to them there but bothers them when watching live action.<p>Perhaps obvious, but opinion of both 48 vs 24 FPS and motion interpolation seems to have a lot to do with expectations weve built from watching previous films (e.g., I watch so little live action that I was oblivious to the frame rate change there). I feel like thats something people overlook (even in this thread) when they talk about these issues; 24 FPS isnt better per se, its just that if you watch enough stuff intended to be played at about that frame rate, anything significantly higher starts to look wrong.<p>(Irrelevantly, a cool anecdote about motion blur: its what led Spielberg to prefer CGI dinosaurs over stop-motion techniques for Jurassic Park. Although animators were producing some fantastic dinosaur models, the lack of motion blur still left them feeling unnatural and out-of-place on film.)",1356179988

And these people are making really broad claims, and doing nothing with them, for the sake of litigation. It's a mockery of the intention of the office.",1356178646

While the organisation would lobby on general tech. policy issues, it's focus would be on start-up tech. entrepreneurs. Other, larger, companies have a voice through the general business lobby, i.e., the CBI in the UK.<p>Unfortunately, this has meant that start-ups---through a combination of lack of time and lack of funds---are not properly represented in the political discourse.<p>At the moment the voice of tech. comes from the likes of Apple and Google, but this is---like you hinted---economically disadvantageous to the start-up crowd. The big companies have an incentive to clampdown on small-time tech. funding and implement regressive licensing policies.<p>Here's my main worry: While the tech. start-up community is essential to ongoing economic growth, esp. as international competition intensifies, time and funding commitments mean that they are sidelined in national and transnational policy/funding settlements.<p>I believe that the community needs to coalesce around an experienced and informed mission group in order to secure our interests.<p>NOTE: Thanks for engaging ig1. The original post made my ambitions in this direction sound too broad. Our discussion has helped me narrow-in on the type of organisation I believe the sector needs.",1356177668

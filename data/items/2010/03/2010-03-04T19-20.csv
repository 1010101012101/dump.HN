1167863,comment,1167080,1167080,0,0,hakunin,,,"As programmers we have to understand how we can program something to seem incredibly intelligent. If we had access to time and resources that universe ""contributed"" to us - we may be able to come up with the type of program that looks, acts, learns, emotionally reacts 100% like a normal human being. Even currently we can get pretty far using image recognition, sound recognition, learning algorithms and fast-lookup data structures. The question of free will is - at which exact point in developing those data structures and algorithms the program gains an illusion of controlling its own actions? Moreover — how can you verify that it did?<p>What the article essentially says is that our brain is nothing but a CPU, programmed over millions of years by natural evolution in a way that it gained all kinds of responses to multitude of various inputs (our 5 senses) in all kinds of combinations, self-improving learning algorithm, and that illusion of consciousness emerged as a by-product of this complex system. Pretty interesting what exact data-structure/algorithm/etc caused this peculiar side effect.<p>It could have something todo with the observation that our brain doesn't need to be whole in order to have consciousness. In different types of physical brain damage, even major ones, a human was able to remain conscious. Same could happen with the other part of brain damaged, which was healthy in another example. So I'm thinking - maybe our the sense of conscoiousness is like a potential difference which makes electrical current flow through the wire - you need to have multiple parts of brain with potential difference to create an illusion of consciousness. This is pretty vague but I like this concept - may be onto something. Consciousness does feel a lot like different parts of brain interacting, or one part /observing/ another and reacting to it just like it'd be reacting to the outside world.<p>Meh.",1267732582

1167849,comment,1167770,1167770,0,0,krisneuharth,,,"Let me begin by saying I disagree with the practice of selling replica watches, online or anywhere. As a watch collector, I feel that sites such as these are deceptive to consumers. Who is to say that the replicas you are selling for $100+ are any different or better than the watches you can buy anywhere else for $20? There is no qualitative way to know the quality of these watches. The watches these watches emulate are expensive for a variety of reasons, mostly exclusivity, but largely because they are well-made and dependable and carry warranties and guarantees. Do you guarantee the quality of these watches? What if I buy one and the craptastic movement dies within a week? Apparently you accept returns.  Will you change your supplier or will you send me the same watch that will also die within a week? These are the reasons that eBay and other notable sites regulate the site of replica items. I would be interested in hearing what value you provide to consumers with these watches and this site.<p>From a design standpoint I would say that this site looks like any other scammy site that sells replica items. If you really want to differentiate, do it with a site design that looks like you actually want to build consumer confidence and not phish credit card numbers and private information. Also, why do you list information about the watches as an image? Spelling errors are rampant throughout the site and only weaken my confidence in your site and products.<p>I'm sure other people here will say this comment is too harsh but I think these are questions that should be addressed.",1267732300

The allegations against leading climate change scientists, whether they are valid or not, highlight an inescapable reality about the world of academic geologists (no matter how ""inconvenient"" of a truth it is): like many scientists, these people need to raise large amounts of funding for relatively boring projects (i.e. ice samples anyone?). But if they tie in their research to a hot (no pun), visible issue (as rendered by the media and politicians, regardless of its scientific merit), then BAM! It's a lot easier to get funding. Hence, climate scientists have a huge incentive to paint global warming as massive, urgent big problem, whether or not it actually is. Seeing data crunched by an amateur, who has the skills to process it, but not the incentives to skew it, means a lot.<p>2) Even though it only shows weather data from a single region, ""global warming"" would presumably be a global phenomenon that one could detect from basically any location (and if this is not the case, then the press needs to revise its doomsday scenarios about global warming necessarily flooding New York City and Shanghai, because if it's only occurring in some places, then we shouldn't use data gathered in Canada to predict catastrophe in East Asia.)<p>I'm not claiming to know the scientific truth about this issue one way or the other, but I do know that there are a lot of forces at play here besides science (funding incentives, politics, news media sensationalism, green energy business interests, etc.), and I think a return to the data is a great place to start unraveling this issue that is far more complex than Al Gore or his opposite Dick Cheney would have you believe.",1267729601

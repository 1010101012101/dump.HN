""What needs to go in this class?"") and long term storage for ideas (""Why does the screenshot on the home page link to an image which you have to close to continue interacting with the site instead of linking into to a conversion funnel?"").<p>Short term ideas go in cheap little $1.50 notebooks.  I hang on to them because I'm a packrat but I don't ever actively search in them.  (I actually tried to prevent a coffee ring on my table the other day with a notebook, and realized that it had the feature list for BCC 1.0 in it.)<p>Long term ideas go into searchable storage because if you can't find them you might as well not have had them.  My blog works fine for my business, since I don't believe in competitively sensitive information and because explaining to 3rd parties sharpens my thinking frequently.  At my day job, where they will not let me just stuff my work product on the public Internet, we use wikis.  If you haven't done this before, try it for a few weeks, it will revolutionize the way you work.  (""How do we set up the test server environment?""  ""Ask Bob.""  ""Bob quit last year.""  ""Awww shucks.""  ->  ""How do we set up the test server environment?""  ""Did you search the Wiki?""  ""Oh yeah.  But it doesn't mention what version of the DB to use.""  ""Well, when you find it out, Wiki it."")",1249368506

I only ever write, not draw/doodle, but actually putting pen[cil] to paper makes me more likely to sit down and brainstorm out a few other ideas while I've got it out. It's also helpful in that, when you later store the thought somewhere more permanent, you have the opportunity to reinterpret and rephrase it to fit with any additions or updates you pondered to it since.<p>When I have fewer pockets, I make do with my iPhone.

So I used admob's numbers about the iTouch vs iPhone to arrive at the number of iPod Touch devices.<p>Yes, people outside the US buy apps :-P  But it's useful to get a device penetration figure (8% of americans) and work with that to do market sizing for a vertical.  You could obviously figure out the penetration figure broken down by each country, but that would be rather time consuming.<p>-Jonathan",1249366922

Too many companies have corporate values printed on little cards, back of pamphlets or even ""chiseled on the marble on the main lobby.""<p>I think about two thirds the slides stressed on hiring the best talent possible, having high performers and keeping high performers. I have to agree. One of the most important things you can do, especially at a smaller company, is hire well.<p>One thing that is lacking is a reference to motivation. Compensating people well is important, but you also need a sense of impact and growth. See Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (a little out dated but a great place to start):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslows_hierarchy_of_needs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslows_hierarchy_of_needs</a><p>I'd say pay is at the lower levels. At the higher levels:\n-People need to feel appreciated (part of that is well compensated).\n-People need to feel like they are making a difference. (Your job adds value)\n-People need to like they're growing. It's not just about getting Sr. added to your job title but actually your learning something and self-actualizing.",1249366830

There are so many things I could say about this article that I'm not even going to try.<p>I didn't recognize the name John Colapinto, but it didn't take long to figure out that I've heard him before. He wrote a book about the infamous case of a boy who, after a botched circumcision as a baby, was forcibly raised like a girl to satisfy the pet gender theory of an unscrupulous psychologist. It was a tragic story. The boy grew up to  courageously challenge the identity that had been imposed on him and lived as an adult male, but killed himself a few years after the book was published. I remember hearing a riveting interview with him and Colapinto on Fresh Air (<a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1111038"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1111038</a>).<p>So that makes two great pieces by John Colapinto.

61375,comment,61320,61369,0,0,Tichy,,,"Hm, interesting idea: lately I have been rather torn between Groovy on Grails and Ruby and Rails, and I worry that both won't suit me. I like the way Grails is done, I think something similar could be built on top of Hibernate and Spring quite fast. I was considering to try it with jRuby, but to use LISP didn't occur to me yet. Perhaps if those Java-LISPs play reasonably well with Spring and Hibernate, a modern web framework for LISP could be built?",1191185260

They might also pay for their API calls in that one, there are a bunch of mirrors for this search engine because sometimes a particular instance doesn't work because it is out of search engine API calls for the day.<p>This works best as a security tool for ""penetration testing"" when you search for domains and IPs.",1191184917

61370,comment,61333,61333,0,0,drm237,,,"I'm still divided on Vista.  I've been using it for well over 2 years starting before the beta stage via an MSDN account. Lately, I use Vista, Ubuntu, and XP evenly throughout the day and XP is my least favorite.  Vista has been more annoying then XP, but the added features (yes there are actually features worth using) make it worth it still.  That said, Ubuntu is great, but I have had more issues with it on an old laptop than either XP or Vista which have both been on the machine.  I think I am more willing to accept Ubuntu's short comings because I know it's open source, and it's what I expect.<p>That said, my next laptop will probably be a mac, although which OS I use most (OSX, Vista, or Ubuntu) has yet to be determined.",1191184715

Unfortunately Lisp's main problem isn't technical.<p>Someone could prove me wrong but I think like Erlang, Lisp just doesn't have a vibrant, growing community - it's pretty stagnant<p>Maybe it's because there are some Lisp jerks that like it that way:

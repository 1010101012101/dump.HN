Then it talks about how things are getting more complex and we're spending more effort to learn things now than we used to because ""we know all the easy stuff"".  And seems to conclude that we'll still be no better than religious shamanistic people once we ""know all there is to know"" and it still won't do us a lot of good.<p>It seems to be advocating give up on science now, with some rational like ""while we're ahead"".<p>I honestly don't get it.  It seems like cloudy wooly thinking, bad arguments.<p>Sure, things are getting more complex and will continue to, but that doesn't mean we should give up, or that ""it's mysteries all the way down"". Every year we learn more and fix more problems. And we have to and always have had to make a lot of mistakes in the process.  The author seems to think we're making more mistakes now and that's an indication the game is almost up.<p>I disagree, medical science is still churning out amazing breakthroughs, like HIV and cancer vaccines this year.  And physics is still coming up with amazing things.<p>Just because it's getting harder doesn't mean we should stop or that we'll hit a wall and be able to go no further (and if we can see that wall coming we might want to think about stopping prematurely?)<p>Everytime we thought we'd learned everything we've been able to push on and learn more, discover more depth, and use it more to our advantage. I don't strictly speaking see why that has to stop just because it's getting harder.  At least any time soon. Each new level also gives us better tools to work with.<p>And there have always been people saying we know enough now, or it's getting harder so lets stop now.  And some have, and many haven't and that's why we still have progress.  This is a age old endless reoccurring trend and bares the same ignoring it has always gotten.  Or you can step off the train of progress and be left behind.<p>I do not think science is failing us at all in anyway.  I think this article is poor on many standards.",1324425574

3375750,comment,3371884,3372639,1,0,akeefer,,,"It's certainly a related problem:  with Go-style implicit interfaces, neither a person nor a machine really has the context to know if something that conforms to the interface is actually intended to be used that way, or if it just happens to have the same method signatures.  As you say, getName() is a pretty common sort of method name that could mean a bunch of different things, and not everything with a getName() method is necessarily interchangeable with everything else.  Explicit interfaces require more work by the programmer, but make those intentions explicit to both other programmers and to automated tools.<p>In Gosu, we already have Java-style explicit interfaces, but we're likely going to add in Go-style implicit interfaces as a language option as well, since they're not completely interchangeable.  The more I think about it, the more I think that you often want implicit interfaces for method arguments, and explicit interfaces for return values.  That's oversimplifying, but as a library author you often want to say ""this method works with anything that has foo() and bar() on it,"" so you want an implicit interface so people can use your library with existing code without changing that code to add explicit interface declarations.  But if you're providing objects back as the result of a function, you might want to be more explicit and make harder guarantees about exactly what sorts of things they return.",1324425295

3375732,story,,,1,0,modernise," Is this book for (movie tech) hackers?",http://amzn.to/rBhsz4,"first part of Chapter 6<p>John Marlenko Jr. had followed in his father's footsteps, joining the Navy and pursuing special forces training to become a SEAL commando, a warrior.  They put him early through Officers Candidate School upon his succeeding SEAL training, making it as his father had, as they call enlisted troops going through OCS to make officer, rather than through the academy stallion.  A SEAL stallion by age twenty-two, presently of age twenty-four, on leave for two months after eighteen months of duty in the middle east, visiting his hometown of Austin.
	Visiting a Western boutique, he buys a leather cowboy hat and boots, listens patiently but indifferently to the salesman's description of proper care for these articles, nodding politely but saying no thanks to the leather care products.  Outside the store, John made a few calls to old friends, looking for someone to see a matinee at the new tech plaza, but everyone had plans for the day.  So he went alone, the TV ads saying they accommodated the single viewer just as well as two, or twenty, or a hundred moviegoers.  John put the hat in the pouch of his motorcycle, put his helmet on, started the bike, and rode out to the plaza.  It opened for business more than a year ago, but there were hundreds of cars in the parking lot.  At the box office he paid for a guided tour and waited service for one viewer.  A cheerful teenage girl bounced up beside him, introducing herself as his hostess, showing him down a long corridor of entries into large theaters, opening into a great round room with doors into single rooms... ""The single viewing hall,"" she said.  ""We have booths on the other side for couples and small families, as well as the big screens for general admission.""  She led him to an available room, seated him into the viewing chair, handing him a menu and cueing the tutorial video onto the convex, parabolic screen, lit from a projector that emerged from above.  She played the tutorial, pointing out the cameras about the edge of the screen, saying they pick up on the viewer's facial expression and body language, adjusting the movie action for the best experience accordingly, and that one could watch the same movie multiple times, and see a different version each time.  ""All the acting is computer-generated,"" she said.  ""Even a lot of the scenery and music.""  Explaining further, that the computer took the composite filming of the actors, in various outfits and various readings and scenes, and computes a the movie on the go, information about the viewing uploaded in real time and the playflow sent back from the datacenter, she said, ""truly a theater of the mind.""  John ordered a beer and fresh pretzel.  ""Coming right up!"" she cheered, keying the order into her handheld tablet.  ""Your waitress will be here in a minute,"" she said, continuing the tutorial.  ""What if I don't like the movie afterwards?"" John asked.  ""Surely that's possible.""
	""Yes of course,"" the girl said.  ""It just shows what it thinks you'll appreciate the most, compared to other versions rated by other viewers.""  She explained that he could rate the experience as the credits begin to roll.  John asked about the length of the show.  The girl informed him that, if he liked, he could set a preferred duration for the viewing, otherwise payable in twenty-minute blocks.  ""Without setting the preference, and the computer picking up a strong interest in the storyline, we've had people watch more than five hours.""
	""Set it for ninety minutes, please,"" John said.
	""Sure thing,"" she chimed.  The waitress arrived with John's order.  The girl finished up the tutorial, asking John what he thought, saying it was all based on his expressions during the time they had been talking.  ""All of that was made up?"" he asked and she nodded with glee.  ""Every bit,"" she said.  ""Netflix thinks you like those actors, or that you would.""
	""How about that.""
	""Would you like to select a movie, or let it choose for you?""
	""Let it choose.""
	She drew his attention to a selector on the chair-side touch panel, showing how to prefer automatic selection for approximately ninety minutes.  After a moment, the lights lowered and a movie started.  She showed him how to order service at any time, then bowed happily and left the booth.",1324424968

More often than not the proceeds of begging go straight back into booze and drugs.<p>Now, there's a certain school of thought where that doesn't matter - these people have shite for lives, who are we to judge if they choose to numb themselves in their hopeless situation. If I was to be homeless for the rest of my life, with no hope of anything else, I probably <i>would</i> start drinking. masterzora pretty succinctly summarized it elsewhere in the thread.<p>Which leads to point #2, which is something I don't think a lot of people really get. I don't claim to be an expert in this issue, but I've worked at shelters and kitchens in the past - and the way I see it, a lot of these people <i>really</i> are hopeless.<p>The second factor that goes hand in hand with homelessness in America is <i>mental illness</i>. That's something some people don't seem to be aware of. Conservatives see the homeless as lazy good-for-nothings. Liberals see them as simply people down on their luck. Both are based on the presumption that becoming ""normal"" again is an option that is on the table. For a <i>large</i> portion of the homeless population, this simply is not true. Even if you resolve the substance dependencies, you still have a litany of mental health issues that will prevent the bulk of these people from being ""functioning"" members of society - functioning in the way that society normally expects of its citizenry anyhow.<p>To circle back to the blog author's question:<p>> <i>""What if EVERYONE gave to beggars?""</i><p>Then you will see an <i>explosion</i> of begging, but <i>not</i> a proportional reduction in homelessness. The ratio of genuinely homeless/needy folk on the street vs. profiteering ""fake"" beggars will become horrifically skewed. The extra noise will mean greater difficulty in necessary social services from reaching the people who need it.

Scientists, the directors of science research funding projects, and the general public can better understand what we know and what we don't know about causation from correlation if science teachers and journalists do a better job.

Some explanations clearly work better than others, which is why, thanks largely to improvements in public health, the average lifespan in the developed world continues to increase. (According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, things like clean water and improved sanitation—and not necessarily advances in medical technology—accounted for at least 25 of the more than 30 years added to the lifespan of Americans during the 20th century.) Although our reliance on statistical correlations has strict constraints—which limit modern research—those correlations have still managed to identify many essential risk factors, such as smoking and bad diets.""<p>So with caution about assuming causation where the data cannot reliably show causation,<p><a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz</a><p>the huge task of biomedical research can still go forward, eventually yielding other findings that can improve health or longevity compared to today's baseline.<p>AFTER EDIT: The question posed in the first reply below is interesting. One reason that biomarker interventions are tried more often than ""hard endpoint"" interventions is simply that they are faster and easier. To really check carefully for hard endpoints--reduced mortality and morbidity, for a medical treatment--takes time in a clinical trial. Sometimes an effective on a biomarker, for example serum cholesterol, can be observed right away, but if the subjects in a study are at an age at which few subjects die from any cause, it can be a long while before a study reveals which treatments actually increase rather than decrease the risk of death.<p>The case of the drug rimonabant,<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimonabant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimonabant</a><p>which had reasonably strong support from animal experiments as an antiobesity drug, is instructive.

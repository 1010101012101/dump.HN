Since the first iPhone came on the market I always read articles that Apple would be alienating the hacker community.

Here&#x27;s the HN item: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6653190"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6653190</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131031/12394625090/feinstein-releases-fake-nsa-reform-bill-actually-tries-to-legalize-illegal-nsa-bulk-data-collection.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131031/12394625090/feinst...</a><p>--<p>Websites like Reddit and HN are extremely vulnerable.<p>Hijacking my comment here to talk about a big concern of mine.  This EFF article argues that there&#x27;s a place for Anonymity on the Internet [2], and I think most of us agree. Especially if we emphathize with those in Iran, China, Syria, and the like.<p>But anonymity is also the key to websites like Reddit and Twitter (including HN).  These websites represent breakthroughs in sociology: memes; open, real-time, transnational,  popular (upvote/downvote, retweetable) discourse.<p>It&#x27;s not an understatement to say that Reddit, Twitter, even H.N. are some of the greatest manifestations of the Internet-age -- look at the impact they have had on mainstream media and raising the bar for popular discourse.<p>(Ex.1: I would argue that the Snowden revelations would not have persisted in the public conscious nearly as long if it hadn&#x27;t been for Reddit&#x27;s continued rage. \nEx.2: As it is, news outlets hawk Reddit/HN for story-material, and build the story&#x27;s narrative with Twitter.)<p>But what HNers must realize is that: The mainstream Internet __can not become__ the Tor-visited Dark-Net that many believe is inevitable -- WITHOUT losing its positive sociological impact.<p>Yet without the perception of anonymity, sites like Reddit will stop flourishing.<p>Reddit&#x27;s culture thrives on anonymity, throwaway accounts, and people being themselves without representing themselves.<p>There are two issues at play. Now obvious: 1.) Reddit usernames can be mapped to people&#x27;s actual identity. Not as obvious: 2.) Users up and down votes can also be mapped to their identity.  Reddit as a dev-team has retreated from the idea of providing HTTPS for its voting/web API, so people&#x27;s actions (aside from comments) can be mapped as well. I tried to raise this point 5 months ago [3]. I know there&#x27;s an argument to be made that SSL/HTTPS is useless anyway (just use Tor!, they say), but the bigger question remains:<p>Can a mainstream community like Reddit exist in tomorrow&#x27;s Internet?<p>People and the press are paranoid about Facebook/Google privacy because its users identify themselves explicitly, but the reality is no different with sites like Reddit - just the perception.  Just think about how much more is shared on a site like Reddit by its members because of their pseudonyms!\nFew people aside from the avid Tor users have realized this.<p>Reddit is the internet &quot;as we know it,&quot; and I feel the Internet is about to change.<p>In hindsight - Google&#x27;s initial &quot;no pseudonyms&quot; policy for Google+ was prescient -- though the company eventually capitulated to popular demand for them. [4] Perhaps they wished to save each of us the unsavory realization that aliases exist in name-only (pun intended). :/<p>[2] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/online-anonymity-not-only-trolls-and-political-dissidents"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/online-anonymity-not-o...</a> \n[3] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1n73s0/again_reddit_needs_fullsite_https/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1n73s0/again_reddit...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/google-allowing-nicknames-pseudonyms-aliases-399584"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibtimes.com/google-allowing-nicknames-pseudonyms-...</a>",1383303306

It made me re-evaluate much of my own behavior in a way no criticism of said behavior ever could have done. I spend so much time on being right or being better, and that is a complete waste of energy. Changing habits is hard, but this random guy sitting somewhere in the world helped me a great deal already, and will continue to inspire me, I&#x27;m sure. The stuff I read so far made and makes me grin all throughout the day, even away from the computer... it&#x27;s just not true that anonymity only makes people behave at their worst, it also frees some of them up to be more loving and/or funny than they might  dare to be in person. Taking some of that spirit and applying it to my thoughts, and to my actions and words towards other people is now a goal of mine.<p>And all that because I wanted to see if the NSA stuff is on reddit too, and getting stuck in some random funny pictures thread, where I saw a comment by that guy!

But one important property of being a responsible adult is that we&#x27;re able to distinguish between fact and fiction and keep everything that&#x27;s fiction safely on that side. So let&#x27;s keep cannonball and all those other races on public roads where they belong: in the movies. If you really think a race across the states on public streets is great I guess you can get those roads blocked by the police - which would be totally fine with me.

What I am saying is you have to be able to physically do the basics in everything.  And modestly well.  There is nothing, nothing that tempers the brain like experiential knowledge.  For chemistry, the basic skills include: reading an NMR, looking at a mechanism and say, that makes no sense, running a silica gel column, shooting something down a mass spec...  For biology, that&#x27;s designing an analytical PCR from scratch, cloning (knowing the difference between a K12 and B strain, for example), doing western blots.  And you better be able to tell me the chemical, protein structural, and enzyme mechanism differences between arginine and lysine without looking it up - I remember knowing biophysicists who couldn&#x27;t do that - I remember PhDs who get their training in ostensibly multidisciplinary labs who couldn&#x27;t do a single thing on that list.  Hell, one of them is a Professor at UW Seattle; when he went off to do his postdoc he was scared out of his pants because he went into a yeast lab without knowing how to clone anything because the tech did all of it for him in grad school.<p>Another real problem is we don&#x27;t teach students anything anymore on the premise that there&#x27;s too much to know, and as long as you can look it up, it will be fine.  Or if you are working interdisciplinarily, your colleague will be able to tell you (of course they&#x27;re relying on you too so there&#x27;s a bootstrapping problem).  This is terrible.  Sometimes you <i>need</i> to call someone on their bullshit, say during a lecture, or even more importantly during a meeting where actionable decisions are being made and critical insight can avoid wasting time and effort.  If you don&#x27;t have a significant <i>depth</i> of knowledge, which multidisciplinarity typically doesn&#x27;t encourage - because it&#x27;s hard - you are just a body making warmth in that room.

Have you, for one second, considered that this is not a sales funnel, where the only thing that counts is the &quot;success rate&quot; at the other end, but something dealing with people in a crisis? People who may just be considering suicide, and can be tipped in both ways. For example by a pseudo-empathic bot that tells them the same shit they hear all day in the US, which sounds nice but is the culturally accepted way to say &quot;Please either pretend to be happy, or shut up&quot; [1].<p>Please generously apply the hacker mentality to software, arduinos, knitting, cooking and art, if you like. Don&#x27;t be afraid to fail, nothing bad happens there. Build, test, iterate, enjoy.<p>There are, however, things in life where the stakes are higher. They require more knowledge than you can quickly gather with a Google search, and, you know, professionalism. Healthcare is one of these topics.<p>[1] As this seems to be a bit of a cultural blind spot for people in the US, I highly recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Bright-Sided-Positive-Thinking-Undermining-America/dp/0312658850"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Bright-Sided-Positive-Thinking-Undermi...</a>",1383300487

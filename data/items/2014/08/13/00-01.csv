Not something society condones - since it was not done in a sanctioned park - but not something that should cause a hysteria because every public space doesn&#x27;t have 100% security.<p>Paranoia feeds into paranoia. These security systems are never minimizing in size, only expanding due to reactionary policy.<p>This is the type of thing that squeezes both freedom and creativity from society, two things that are heavily intertwined and interdependent.",1407891595

Using computer to brute-force through hypothesis <i>might</i> be useful, and works like Voevodsky&#x27;s one are both cool and useful, but when something like that becomes overrated it seems kinda sad to me.<p>&quot;Machines do the grunt work and leave humans free for deeper thinking&quot;, really? Let me put it this way: what is the most important thing about, say, Pythagorean theorem? From the engineer&#x27;s point of view it could be ability to find the length of the side of right triangle given the other two or something like that. From the mathematical point of view the most important thing about that or any other theorem is its <i>proof</i>. It isn&#x27;t actually that important that you cannot divide arbitrary angle by 3 equal parts using only compass and the ruler — the way how you prove it is what really matters.<p>So, once again, autoverifiers are wonderful and so on, but if someone thinks that writing incomprehensible, but <i>correct</i> proofs is as fine as it gets — it&#x27;s huge mistake to think so.

You&#x27;ve implicitly invoked one possible reason why unprofessional behavior among men might create obstacles for women, rebutted it, and declared the debate over. If this was an argument over the right way to interpret statistics over a website optimization scheme, you&#x27;d laugh at you.<p>Considering only gender policy, what is the most significant difference between doctors and engineers? Obviously: distribution among genders in medicine is much more balanced than in technology.<p>Stipulate that romantic overtures are <i>as common</i> in medicine as in technology. What basis do you have for your implied claim that the impact of such an overture is the same in medicine as it is in technology? It seems straightforward and reasonable to presume that the impact of an unwanted overture is much more powerful for someone who is part of a small minority, for whom the overture comes from a member of the overwhelming majority.<p>Michael O. Church has conjured an entire ethos in which he&#x27;s been oppressed not just by venture capitalists but the entire industry they fund. He believes it so strongly that he has <i>advocated violence</i> to address the problem. And he&#x27;s a <i>guy</i>, who feels locked out of the industry not because of a gender bias that has persisted overtly through pretty much all of human history, but instead due to unfair performance reviews.<p>From your comment history, you strike me as someone who has in his life actually talked to a woman. But comments like this force me to remind myself of that. Have you not talked to one who was shaken by being hit on by a guy in a work setting? I am not the suave, athletic bachelor you obviously are, and I&#x27;ve managed to hear this story from actual women repeatedly. If you have heard this story before, how are you managing to handwave it away so easily?",1407888234

In your example, if you compared two groups that are identical, the only difference being one plays soccer and the other doesn&#x27;t, you&#x27;d find a correlation between soccer and broken hips.",1407888185

Then they can just refuse to traffic said files if illegal.  It could be as simple as testing a file hash like VirusTotal and making a judgement call. Then if someone wants to traffic in illegal content they&#x27;ll at least have to resort to crypto.",1407888002

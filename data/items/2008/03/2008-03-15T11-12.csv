What if u put 100 ideas on your web-page and nobody pays for it but still goes ahead uses it in some other part of the world???
But there are ways to deal with this kind of situation - it just requires a motivation and persistence ...<p>Also people say ideas are worth nothing is because most of the time there is no explanation or analysis or research done to support the idea - also we have a habit to value the idea only when it comes from a popular source else we dont even bother to listen to it. If an idea comes from pg then people will listen to it, but if the same idea comes from a guy on the street then our doubts take precedence.<p>Conclusion : Ideas are much more worth than what a normal belief is -  you cant execute anything w/o having an idea - idea generates creativity - it generates dreams - and If you can't dream, then you can't WIN !!!",1205582379

Frankly if you are at a point where you are ready to hire people, a FAIR salary (not even thinking of future profits or the potential value of stock options) is the only arrangement that aligns your interests with that of your staff.<p>Expecting people to work long hours routinely is a great recipe for failure, unless you are doing something totally uninspired and brainless to start with, in which case having zombies do the work is sure to work just as well.",1205581117

It's not rocket science.<p>DVD is certainly my last 'hard copy format'. After DVD, the natural progression is to go digital distribution.",1205580821

They login and the free slot agenda is presented to them. They can then reserve the time slot they want or change it later. This avoids blind and long discussion through phone with the secretary. Of course the client is given a password controlled access so that he is identified. This service was sold but was far too expensive. A freemium business model should be offered instead.<p>Another very useful service is the one provided for free (with ads) by www.doodle.ch allowing for a group of people to converge (by vote) on a meeting date. It is nice to have it free, but in a company we would prefer one without ads and hosted internally for confidentiality. A company would certainly be ready to pay for such an application. Beside I'm quite sure a more user friendly and ergonomic interface could be invented.",1205579737

There is however the possibility that the two interesting numbers, required power input and power output, do not grow with the size of the reactor/amount of plasma in the same way, e.g. one function might be quadratic, the other cubic. So it is possible that the current prototype does not generate a surplus, but it might indicate enough about those two functions to indicate that a &quot;slightly&quot; larger version would (assuming no unforeseen technical or physical issues arise). It sounds like it&#x27;s too early to say though.",1417093033

See the information in the other comments. It&#x27;s hard to say for sure, even the primary sources seem fuzzy. But this graphic seems to indicate that they are indeed extracting electric energy from the molten aluminum: <a href=""http://images.bwbx.io/cms/2014-11-26/tech_aluminumgraphic49_630.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.bwbx.io/cms/2014-11-26/tech_aluminumgraphic49_...</a><p>This presentation also shows the energy arrow pointing from the aluminum plant to the consumer:

But as far as I can understand, this +/-25% is the long term average. Of course they need to consume a positive net amount of energy during the day to keep the plant running.<p>But it seems that they are able to pump energy back into the grid for a short amount of time, which would be during the hours when solar/wind power is at a minimum.",1417093018

8666999,comment,8662782,8666363,0,0,kevingadd,,,"COM/DCOM have offered a relatively usable solution for interprocess and cross-machine RPC for... quite a while. I used it to do interprocess communication back in the VB6 era (it was built-in), and in fact I did it <i>by accident</i>. I picked the wrong checkbox in the project options, so I ended up with the user interface of my application and the backend literally running in separate processes.<p>Other than the performance overhead (that I initially chalked up to &#x27;oh, COM is just slow I guess&#x27;), the way I finally noticed was when a pointer I passed across the COM boundary wasn&#x27;t valid (because it was to memory in another process). Whoops! Everything was working perfectly up until that point.<p>(FWIW, I am pretty sure the invalid pointer thing only happened because I was passing a raw address around - VB6 doesn&#x27;t have pointer types.)<p>Plus, since COM provides ways to do source-level and binary compatibility, you can leverage that for your RPC.<p>I won&#x27;t call it <i>awesome</i>, but it&#x27;s quite robust and gets used in many places on Windows.<p>At a more basic level, you can trivially implement RPC using windows messages, though the security model improvements in 7 and 8 have made this a bit more complicated. There is excellent, straightforward infrastructure for establishing message loops and sending messages - really easy to get right - and it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> require your application to have UI. Pretty much any thread can receive and process messages if it wants to.",1417092936

The current process most likely requires a steady current and they are adapting the process to ramp up during times of cheap energy and throttle it during times of expensive energy.

To deal with this situation, TRIMET is using the tool “power modulation” since 2008 to compensate these strong price effects. Simultaneously the strong growth of renewable energy sources leads to a need of primary regulation energy for stabilizing the electricity grid at 50 Hz. In this context, TRIMET is the first electricity consumer world wide, which provides primary regulation energy by modulating a consumer. Traditionally this source of energy is only provided by power plants or energy storage plants, e.g. pumped energy storage or stationery batteries.<p><a href=""http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/281A8D0A5E4E0F0085257A48004DD9DA?OpenDocument"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/281...</a><p>Now were getting closer to the real thing.<p>Edit II [2]:<p>TRIMET Aluminium SE is developing a process that can turn electro-
lytic furnaces for the production of primary aluminum in collabora-
tion with conventional power plants into energy storage reservoirs
for renewable energy. Aluminum has a high energy density. This
makes its production energy-intensive and aluminum smelters re-
cipients of base-load electricity. Excess energy is stored in the light
metal. The principle behind the new process is the grid-commutated operation of the production equipment. To ensure this, the electrolysis cells are modified so that their output can be increased or reduced for several hours, as needed. The ope- rating point is selected in such a way that the output can be raised or lowered by more than 25 percent for hours. This makes it possible to provide enormous storage capacity. Using this method, TRIMET aluminum smelters could provide outputs of up to 130 megawatts with future capacities of up to 6,000 megawatt hours. This corresponds to the daily energy consumption of two million people.<p>The “virtual battery” relies on the improved flexibility of aluminum elec- trolysis. With this method, TRIMET is revolutionizing the basic principle of a manufacturing process that has existed for more than 120 years. An electrolytic furnace is similar to a water container whose walls are made of ice. To ensure that the tank does not melt, the ambient temperature must be kept very low. But it must not reach a temperature that is too cold, or the water in the tank will freeze. Similarly, the temperature of the electrolytic furnace must be harmonized in order to stabilize the fur- nace walls under fluctuating power supply levels. The process developed by TRIMET regulates this balance through the clever use of exhaust heat, a form of thermal insulation that can be adjusted in an innovative way.<p>The process offers significant advantages over other storage systems. At 85 percent, the efficiency factor of the aluminum storage reservoir approaches that of pump storage reservoirs, far higher than those of compressed-air or hydrogen storage reservoirs. what’s more, the system does not require new power lines, since it is
integrated into the existing high-voltage grid.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.trimet.de/fileadmin/pdf/trimet-at-a-glance-2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trimet.de/fileadmin/pdf/trimet-at-a-glance-2013.p...</a>",1417091466

I heard many parts of it are actually pretty well-engineered. The Windows NT kernel has pluggable subsystems, one of which is for Windows applications, but there used to be also a POSIX layer. In the kernel, almost everything is an object and can have ACLs (security descriptors). You actually do have something like Linux&#x27; /dev and /proc, it&#x27;s just not exposed to the shell (you can sometimes see hard drive device paths, not legacy drive letters like C:, shine through the cracks, but mostly when there are boot problems).<p>Even in the shell, there are a few neat ideas. Everything is a (COM) object, and has interfaces. Applications can embed parts of the shell, e.g. explorer windows, and they can also contribute back parts, like custom places and icon types.<p>Of course there are layers and layers of cruft in Windows, but funnily, the older parts seem to be better engineered (especially taking to account their age, and looking over things like legacy 8.3 module names). Its a bit telling that the new Windows Runtime is actually a new version of native COM underneath, and not .NET CLR (but both are fully brigded).<p>I think the hardest part to emulate for ReactOS is not the old cruft, but the modern cruft. WPF for example does have a few nice ideas, but its insanely huge and complicated. And a typical windows system has like 4 different, incompatible .NET runtime libraries (.NET, Silverlight, WPF, WinRT). This is one thing I hope MS will get sorted out in the future.",1417091181

For organizational concerns it may be easier to say that a team is responsible for a (micro)service than for a library, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be easier. If they change their API all users will suffer anyway. It doesn&#x27;t have to help much with scaling either. If the service/library is the thing that uses most of the cpu it will still help to add more servers with everything on them. Microservices actually may cause bigger lag since the network connections may take time (app calls service 1 which calls service 2 etc). If they all were libraries on the same server the calls would be much faster.<p>You do get an opportunity to monitor each service easier if they live on separate machines (or just separate processes). If you want that with libraries you need to add monitoring code to all libraries and then collect data from them to see where the bottlenecks are. You might also need to develop new tools to configure things like pool-sizes and cache-sizes for each library. For example saying that you should have 5 threads (or handlers) handling mail-messaging and 20 threads/handlers handling calculations. You might also want to be able to change theese configurations in a live system. I think a lot of applications misses this monitoring and configuration part and then gets into problem because of that.
And of course microservices helps with using different languages for different parts, even though most organizations I&#x27;ve seen seem to mandate a specific language anyway.",1417090908

Why isn&#x27;t a diff applied directly to the abstract syntax trees of a language, for example? However, I think part of the robustness of version control systems comes from keeping things simple, namely line-based diffs, and with that comes a preference for keeping line-based diffs short.",1417090347

Would this come in handy for securing large media files? What other scenarios would you find it useful?<p>A bit of quick background -- A team of 4 GPU engineers developed and then super optimized AES (all key & block sizes) on CUDA and OpenCL. On dedicated GPUs, we can go as much as 80Gbps on highend GPUs. On the ec2 g2 instances, we achieve 10Gbps. This throughput is much higher than what you would get from AES-NI (Intel&#x27;s hardware accelerated AES instructions) and also save your CPU cycles for all your other stuff. It runs on CPU too if no GPU is available.<p>We built it into a cross platform (Windows/Linux) commercial SDK solution. You can plug it into your application with just a couple of lines of code change!<p>It&#x27;s about 50k LOC with all GPU kernels hand optimized to squeeze every possible flop out of the GPUs. We&#x27;re just limited by the PCIe data transfer limits.<p>Now I am exploring my options and thinking about selling the technology and need feedback from people who have sold source code before and pros & cons.",1417089785

I worked a JBoss/Spring/Hibernate/Tomcat contract a while back; that thing was an unholy mess which took 4 minutes(!) to start up. However, there are much lighterweight frameworks out there; I&#x27;m currently building an app on angular -> dropwizard/guice/jdbi, which overall is quite elegant.

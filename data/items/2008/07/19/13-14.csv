Put 60-70% of your money in government bonds (regular and inflation-indexed), and the other rest in US small-cap value stocks, international small-cap value stocks, and emerging market stocks. These sectors have been more volatile, but with higher returns, over the last 80 years. Historically, this portfolio would perform about as well as an 80/20 stock/bond split. And if the market drops 90%, you still have 60%+ of your money safe.<p>I'm not convinced that this is the way to go, but it is interesting.",1216475410

250641,comment,250606,250606,0,0,jm4,,,"SQL Injection Part II? It's a textbook example of SQL injection. I guess it's interesting if you haven't seen one before, but this isn't some new and more evil version of an old attack. It's just the same old attack that's been around since the beginning of SQL-backed applications. The moral of the story is to always validate user input.<p>All these examples are in ColdFusion and for many years- going back at least 5 years ago when I used it- CF developers have known to use <cfqueryparam> to pass user data to queries. It's the CF equivalent of binding parameters to a query. Every example presented here can easily be protected against using that method.<p>The only people that have to worry about this are the laziest of the lazy developers.",1216474366

Does this mean they have this same ask-everyone-else-to-fork-over-cash strategy in place for all contributors?\nWith billions in hand, if they are willing to host a page, shouldn't they pay the bill atleast to look 'non evil'?",1216473856

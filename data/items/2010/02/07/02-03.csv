You can't use the title ""Professional Engineer"" without licensing, but non-licensed engineers can and usually do use the term ""engineer"", or derivatives like ""chemical engineer"" on their business cards and resumes. It's the norm in firms with a lot of engineers (like, say, Exxon) that most of the people whose job title includes the word ""engineer"" are not PEs. It doesn't even really give you any benefit to be a PE in the corporate context, because everything you're doing is on behalf of the corporation anyway; you're not an independent contractor providing services that you have to legally stand behind, but an employee doing work for hire.<p>edit: This is true for the U.S. anyway.

1107128,comment,1106635,1106635,0,0,lmkg,,,"One of the best points for chalk over powerpoint is that it's easy to diverge from the script if you need to. A good teacher adapts to the needs of the student(s). Secondarily to this, chalk allows for a script that is more interactive to begin with (eg, ""who can give me an example of an abelian group?"" followed by verifying the axioms).<p>But, while powerpoint may be a fundamentally weaker medium, I think part of the problem is that a lot of people are simply bad at it. Having an optimal presentation requires a lot of attention to things like pacing, and separating content between the powerpoint itself and the delivery. I get the feeling that a lot of people don't look further than content. Hint: if you print your slides and distribute them as notes, they are not optimal for at least one of those purposes[1].<p>[1] However, optimal slides printed out with room to take notes during a lecture can often be made into optimal notes by a good student.",1265509546

The first people to get licensed, because that was the entire industry at the time, were things like boiler and power engineers.  Suppose you were a young engineer and you wanted your PE license to design metal detectors ""properly"".  You'd have had to specialize in something like power systems, sign up with whoever had a PE on staff, spend 6-12 months sizing transformer windings and designing 50 kV relays (because most PEs worked at places like that).  Then you have to jump ship to work with a different PE, because you need to accumulate an apprenticeship under four PEs before you can get a license.  Only then can you get your license and go back to school to specialize in what you actually want to do.  Finally, in your late 20s, with no job longer than a year, and just starting work on your passion, you can <i>try</i> to get a job in metal detection.<p>Most new engineers sensibly decided to just break the law.  Even if the engineering board were certain to catch up with you, it would be easier to quietly move to another state in the middle of the night and start over.  And the actual odds are more like one in 10,000.<p>P.S. IIRC Texas scrapped a lot of their silly PE laws.",1265508401

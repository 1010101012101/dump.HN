And that for a large part of its history, people were responsible for their own crime control?<p>I could go on -- at length -- about various places where people did just fine without government structure. In the old west, for instance, marshals might not make it through town but once every couple of months. Didn't seem to slow down westward expansion that much. European traders worked all over the world just on a handshake and a promise for centuries.<p>Anthropologists studying tribes tell us that there are a few things that distinguish true tribes from modern cultures. One of those is the idea of private property: what is mine is mine and you can't take it from me unless under very unusual circumstances. In very primitive societies, the chief or the tribal elders can come around and just take what they want. It's only after we had the concept of private property and contract law that we saw significant economic and cultural growth.  It was observing this state of nature that eventually created the political theory that is the bedrock of the country.<p>In communist China, just after the revolution, they would have ""people's courts"". These courts basically consisted of a mob of people who would bring in rich people, describe at length how they ""exploited"" the workers, and then strip them of all their goods. Sometimes for good measure they'd send them to jail or kill them. It was great political theater -- the crowds loved it -- but what were the results?<p>This was not a time of record growth, or even a time when the lives of the average citizen got that much better. All they really ended up doing was just replacing the folks who got rich signing contracts and respecting property rights with the folks who got rich being politically connected and doing whatever they liked.<p>Just some things for you to consider. I know I don't want to see any version of people's courts here in my lifetime.",1236808580

While as an entrepreneur myself, I wish that was the case, in reality though, the two are tightly coupled.<p>Even though startup funding-needs are smaller these days, very few entrepreneurs can find a team who would work for free all the way to profitability. In fact, VCs today are able to get more equity for less money.<p>But the fundamental problem is that the average time for exit is getting longer, mainly due to the poor stock market condition, where IPO have almost disappeared and corporates are willing to put smaller amounts for M&A.<p>Once the market will bounce back and stratup will have a more promising outlook, I'm sure you'll see VCs happy to invest and startups happy to take the money.<p>Mor Sela

512685,comment,512231,512231,0,0,danprager,,,"Learning Scheme helped my Python by teaching me some new (to me) idioms, besides the first-class function stuff.<p>For example, it is natural in Scheme to declare a lot of local information, including local function definitions.  These have the great advantage of knowing about variables within the local environment.  So rather than declaring an external function with heaps of parameters to pass in local state, you just declare a local function which automatically gets access to the variables in the surrounding scope.<p>The same idiom works neatly in Python too, but didn't occur to me previously.<p>* * *<p>Also after learning Python and Scheme, Ruby felt a bit like a cross between the two, and quite comfortable.",1236808100

With no explicit government in place, crime rules.  We can all agree that criminal rule is not ""getting along fine"", and in fact we have, it's why we create governments to begin with.<p>No man is an island, we are tribal creatures, and always have been even before we were man.<p>> Democracy isn't some club used by the majority to tyrannize the minority.<p>Actually, it is exactly that.

In a sense, my job, my studies, and my life all took place in the same small room. If I didn't control my space, I wasn't able to be productive, and thus I became stressed.<p>I built a solution around my door. If it was closed, residents couldn't come in, and I couldn't go out. I had to be studying. There had to be a reason that I was isolating myself.<p>If it was open, I had to be interacting with my residents. Running or planning events on the floor, socializing in the lounge, and building stronger connections with the community. I wasn't allowed to isolate myself.<p>Anything in between - browsing the web, reading, or idly poking at work - and the door was cracked.<p>Find a signal and make it known to others, and to yourself.  Make sure it has a real impact: you can't collaborate through a closed door. And don't forget to build in time to get away from it all.<p>For a startup compound? Get a bulky desktop computer for work and a sleek laptop for play. Never let them within an arms length of each other.",1236806083

512634,comment,512537,512537,0,0,chris11,,,"This is horrible advice. Sure, you should always deal with boredom and a lack of motivation in your career, but that doesn't mean quitting after two weeks.<p>If the job entailed doing something new, for instance a sales job for me since I haven't done a lot of sales, you should a least stick it out. I'd really doubt that you would have the knowledge and experience to be successful at a totally new task after two weeks.<p>And if the job tasks you hated, weren't new for to you, I question the level of research you did before accepting the job. Basically, quitting before two weeks should only be for huge problems, like if someone with a potentially deadly allergic reaction to peanuts was asked to work in a peanut processing plant. Those issues should all be taken care of before you accept the job.<p>Also the company is making a big investment in hiring you, so I'd consider it almost unethical to quit a job after weeks just because I disliked it. She should have worked with her boss and the company to improve her job satisfaction.",1236806018

324456,comment,323540,324413,0,0,jyu,,,"Credit is useful for buying things you don't have enough immediate cash to buy, like cars or houses.  It allows you to leverage, which is a powerful concept if used wisely.  For a simple example, if you buy an investment property with a 20% cash down, and you sell it for 10% increase, then your ROI is 100%.<p>Having a credit card is like having health insurance.  Insurance allows me to reduce my risk of going broke.  Hopefully you never have to use the insurance, and the average expected return may favor not having insurance, but the return is worth it.  In the same way, having good credit and a credit card (even if you pay in full each month) allows you another option to get out of some sticky short term cashflow situations.<p>The big difference between credit cards and health insurance is that you can use credit cards and keep your expenses the same, while health insurance is an additional expense.  So you can spend the same amount with or without a credit card, but gain free financial insurance.",1223250633

Per-connection state uses memory, so creating more connections will exhaust memory OR it will cause no more connections to be created - both cases are a form of DoS.<p>A naive approach is to initiate a lot of connections, but never complete the setup. That's a SYN flood. Another approach is to actually complete the handshake, then initiate a tear down and never complete it. The OS at the server end gets stuck with a lot of half-closed connections that may take many minutes to timeout and there's no application control over this. There's no control over this 'stuck' connections at the OS level either, the only option is to wait for them to die off as per TCP spec.<p>There are other variations, but you get the idea.

We cut at least ten or fifteen checks for more than 10k each month, the top usually being around $25k.<p>If you invest the effort, you can make it with an MLM. Of course, there are much better and/or easier ways, but I don't think that it's fair to call all MLMs ""slimers"". Most of our distributors signed up because they loved the product and it gave them a network to socialize about it with. They generally made enough money to purchase the products they'd be purchasing anyway and have a few bucks left over. I don't see the problem in this, really, as long as your company is up-front about it and focuses on the products and not the ""get rich quick"" stuff.<p>It's a great way for the entrepeneur to get rich, though.

They decided to insure insane amount of CDO, which are not regulated, and being used not for hedging, more like bets in the market. Lehman Bros/Bear Stearn are not governments mess. They decided to leverage themselves at an absurd 1/30+ ratio. The goverment has been staying away from them, and look what happened.</i><p>I don't disagree.  At least not entirely.  Where I disagree is in the distinction between what government should and shouldn't do, and how the ""didn't do"" played out in this particular disaster.  If government is to take part in a free market economy, it's purpose is to enforce contracts, prevent fraud, and come down hard on those that lie, cheat or steal: trust is the most important currency in a market economy, and when it's lost, nothing works anymore.  Pyramid or Ponzi schemes are illegal in the United States.  Seems to me that a very strong case can be made that CDOs are merely the modern equivalent.  At the very least there was significant deception happening at the point where junk debt was re-branded as quality debt, and that claims that this junk debt was ""insured"" against loss were simple fraud.<p>We have laws for all of that, and in a just world, there would be consequences.  But, we're talking about some of the wealthiest people on earth...consequences aren't really their style, and our government agrees with them.<p>I'm not saying the finance industry, or a large percentage thereof, is free of blame.  I'm saying it's like bike theft and the New York and San Francisco black market: it's a wholly unpunished crime, and so it is rampant.  For the kind of people willing to do anything they can get away with to make money, the US government extended an open invitation to lie, cheat, and steal your way to a few million or billion bucks.",1223249958
324441,comment,323540,324413,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Credit is useful for a lot of things, and it's not likely that you'll _never_ need to go into debt. Credit is a tool that can be used properly or abused, just like anything else. It's important to have good credit ... even if you never plan on needing a loan, it prepares you in case a circumstance arises where it is necessary to obtain one, and it's just smart to have good credit established.<p>Never spend money you don't have, just charge things to your card and pay it off at the end of the month (or carry a balance a couple of months at a time once in a while, some people say this improves your credit score, and some companies will get pissed and cancel your account if they're not making at least some interest). Then, if you ever need it, that credit history will be there, and it is often used for things besides debt. They generally check credit when you go to rent an apartment, etc. Some people are even checking the credit of job candidates now. It's good to have good credit history.",1223249841

In the literary genre of systemd criticism there are better examples, mostly from people fond of the microkernel design aesthetic.<p>&quot;Systemd will start them both at the same time, but buffer any messages A tries to send to B until B is ready.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not systemd which is buffering messages, it&#x27;s the kernel&#x27;s IP or UNIX domain sockets. (Also, this means that daemons don&#x27;t need to run setuid root just to bind a low socket.)<p>&quot;With systemd, the order is not deterministic, so you don’t know what’s going to happen next time you boot.&quot;<p>All you need to do is define the dependency graph properly, then any possible ordering will be fine. You might as well argue that &quot;make -jN&quot; is somehow harmful.<p>&quot;A server spends several minutes in the BIOS during POST anyway, before the bootloader is even run; making the OS boot faster doesn’t change very much&quot;<p>Never used virtualization or containers?<p>&quot;That doesn’t feel modular to me.&quot;\n&quot;Cleaning up or re-implementing ntpd is a good thing, but OpenBSD didn’t feel the need to make it part of init.&quot;<p>The systemd project is not (any more) an init system, it&#x27;s a collection of tools to create a Linux-based OS from. <a href=""http://www.openntpd.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openntpd.org/</a> says that OpenBSD includes OpenNTPD as part of its base system.<p>&quot;OpenNTPD was primarily developed by Henning Brauer as part of the OpenBSD Project and gets released as a base component of OpenBSD every six months.&quot;<p>Clearly this is the same as what systemd does? Do we conclude from this that OpenBSD feels &quot;not modular&quot;, since it has an NTP implementation in the same repository as its init, or is it only bad if systemd does it?<p>&quot;Regular journal corruption that Lennart says is not a problem. It seems obvious that a non-transactional binary log is a terrible idea.&quot;<p>As opposed to plain text files, which magically survive having random blocks overwritten by hypothetical filesystem bugs or hardware issues without losing a single line of log content?<p>&quot;Numerous reports of systemd hanging on boot because of something in fstab that violated POLA.&quot;<p>Does this refer to systemd implementing the &quot;nofail&quot; keyword exactly as it was documented? The author will be very surprised when he discovers that FreeBSD does <i>exactly</i> the same thing, except that the keyword is called &quot;failok&quot;.<p>&quot;To my knowledge, no one has ever lost data as a result of a bug in ZFS.&quot;<p>Does the author have access to Sun/Oracle&#x27;s internal bug tracker where such customer bugs would be reported, in particular during the early years of ZFS&#x27;s existence?",1450774677

These reviews suggest that children who achieve at school typically have more books in the home, have parents that report reading to them more frequently (usually every day but at least 3 times per week), and begin shared reading at a very early age (usually before 18 months of age). How parents read to children also appears to be important. The dialogic approach is a child-adult interactive approach to reading aloud that, compared with other styles,15 predicts better emergent literacy skills, such as print motivation, vocabulary, print awareness, narrative skills, letter knowledge, and phonologic awareness.&quot;",1450773123

It&#x27;s more than a checklist system, more than a calendar, etc. It&#x27;s how these pieces work in concert with one another.<p>Whether through GTD or some other system of operating/thinking, we are all craving a way to have things taken care of for us and not having to worry about them. Imagine if you had a little robot friend that reminded you about your appointments. It would wake you up when you wanted to be woken up (and never failed you like an alarm clock). You could tell the robot to remind you of an idea you just had and want to think about at a different time & the robot would remind you at a good time.<p>This robot could be seen as an extension of the mind. Like the invention of ink & paper.<p>But this little robot doesn&#x27;t exist yet. We have to use our own hands and minds, or we can delegate to other people. GTD is an attempt to do this.<p>Now I should admit that I do not follow GTD fully. I am using GTD plus some other pieces, but I do see GTD as one of the hearts.<p>And this took me 2-3 years before I started to reap the benefits. For the first 2 years it was an off-and-on thing. Things would run smoothly, and then a clog would get caught in the piping, leading to productivity relapse.<p>The problem with GTD is that there are too many integral pieces, and if any one of those pieces breaks down the whole system breaks down. I was fortunate enough to have health issues and not have a job at the time so I could pour countless hours into this on the faith that I would reach consistency.<p>In hindsight, the only reason why I bought into GTD religiously in the first place, inspiring me to put in retarded amounts of time was that I was reading heavily into willpower, and the importance of conserving mental energy, especially for decision making and other high-level brain functions. The book Willpower by Roy F. Baumeister had endorsed David Allen and GTD.<p>I respect Baumeister immensely as he is an opponent of the self-esteem movement, a movement that has really fucked up many peoples&#x27; ability to self-regulate their emotions and focus. As everyone was focusing on the promises of higher self-esteem (Baumeister also started in this area), he was researching things like self-control, emotional intelligence, focus and willpower.",1450772881

It&#x27;s easy enough to build packages for, and we recently committed it to FreeBSD ports where you can get a whole up to date HDFS/HBase stack without 3rd party garbage.<p>The hard part is HBase and to a lesser degree HDFS.. there are just a lot of things to read and learn about, and failure to address one of them will eventually cause interesting struggles.  That said, my company looked at the field in 2012 and chose OpenTSDB, and it&#x27;s handled things well enough considering fairly poor configuration of HBase.  We recently reevaluate the space and tried Influx and Karios.  Influx fell on its face in several ways that will take years to fully iron out, Kairos trades one set of evil for another, so we decided to do some learning and redeploy OpenTSDB correctly.

I suspect an excessive emphasis on phonics makes it harder for kids to learn to spell.<p>But that&#x27;s a quibble.

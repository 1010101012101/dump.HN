7764395,comment,7763711,7763962,4,0,noobermin,,,"In this case the energy that goes into creating the e+e- pairs far outweighs the energy you get out. For example, given that this is Quantum Mechanics, there is a non-zero but not necessarily close to one probability of creating a pair from a given pair of photons. One could imagine the other light that didn&#x27;t interact would just escape to the environment. You can conceptualize this as an photon produced to pair created efficiency, and I don&#x27;t see it for any reason being very big.<p>Then again, I&#x27;m not sure I understand the experiment, for example, I&#x27;m not sure how a blackbody spectrum helps in the breit-wheeler process. I think that the light colliding at a perpendicular incidence helps, but other than that, I can&#x27;t see how the spectrum of radiation matters...like how is using a blackbody spectrum is better than, say, a monochromatic laser?

America did not invent drones and it has never been the only source for the technology. Countries like Israel and South Africa were using modern tactical drones in combat long before the first Predator took to the skies.<p>But drones aren&#x27;t the real issue, they&#x27;re still relatively unsophisticated aircraft that, even when armed, are not any more deadly than manned combat aircraft and the array of sophisticated weaponry that most countries have access to.<p>The real issue is the rapid development of robotics, of which UAVs (aka drones) are a subset, that promises to dramatically change warfare. The first robots equipped with AI software to automatically identify and shoot at targets will probably be ground robots like the Talon or SWORDS, not UAVs flying 20 000 ft above the battlefield. Russia is already experimenting with such autonomous AIs on their Taifun-M robot, as are others.<p>At the current rate of development it&#x27;s difficult to even imagine how far this technology will go and what robots will be capable of, but suffice to say we&#x27;re already seeing levels of capability most believed were science fiction just a decade ago.<p>Point is, arguing about armed drones like the Reaper and Predator is not going to solve anything and it&#x27;s a distraction from the real ethical debates that need to be happening around weaponised robotics.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7709420"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7709420</a>",1400446637

I don&#x27;t get caught up in all the hype of different weight lifting exercises or different name of workouts.<p>The number one thing that I can gather from reading this article and understanding how people typically act when exercising, trying to make themselves better, is that they judge others harshly. Even the OP is quite harsh on CrossFit. She has so much &quot;experience&quot; because of her championships and whatnot but I, to a certain degree, have to disagree with her. Not because she is right or wrong but because of her lack of experience in CrossFit. She is telling others not to do it under any circumstances simply because she never experienced these workouts in her collegiate career. Maybe this is something new and better (probably not) but I do not like how she has given herself power to proclaim so many others wrong. Just as they would do to her if given the chance. I think the OP should have been more understanding or even more persuasive in her post. That, I feel, is a make better way to get people on your side. (Not that we are not all on the same side.)<p>CrossFit on the other hand does not seem to be a proper vehicle for getting the masses in a proper routine. Trainers should not be deemed as such in a weekend and that is sad. However, as always people are lazy and do not read the fine print. This is a problem deeper than CrossFit or exercising in general.<p>I guess overall my comment is here to say make your own path and earn it. Do not rely on others to do so and also if your do have experience and truly think your can help others become a trainer or coach (after YEARS of training) and help others reach their goals.

There are probably a lot of evolutionary theories on anti-social behavior in humans, say. Maybe some people are inclined to kill people in a surge of passion because that is some latent fight-or-flight instinct that has been beneficial for the survival of the organism, yadda yadda yadda. So what, though? That is not interesting when it comes to considering what is ethical and what is not.<p>It may seem that I am bringing up extreme cases, when procreating is seemingly benign. There are still considerations that one might have, though; even if it is beneficial for the propagation of the organism&#x27;s DNA to have a certain amount of children - maybe for example 5 is the best in order to make sure they grow up relatively well - it isn&#x27;t necessarily ethical. Maybe 3 children is the best for a happy and full childhood, with enough parental attention. Maybe bringing children into the world isn&#x27;t something that a certain person should do, because of some terrible genetic disease (now we&#x27;re straying into eugenics, and we probably know too little about DNA to be able to say that so-and-so should procreate and so-and-so should not). Propagating DNA shouldn&#x27;t even be a goal in itself, ethically speaking. Humanity might have done more harm than good in becoming 7 billion people. And I don&#x27;t just mean bad for each other, but in causing stress to ecosystems and the global climate which lead to natural disasters and other organisms struggling to adapt and survive.<p>So what if there is some evolutionary basis for some behavior? There has to be <i>some</i> reason. But that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that we should endorse or encourage that behavior (whatever behavior is being considered).<p><i>Why did he kill him?

If you install language-level packages with system-level package managers, then each language package needs to support every single system-level package manager. E.g. you write a Ruby package and now you have to support apt-get, yum, Gentoo, Arch, brew, MacPorts, etc. This is a completely ridiculous situation to put language developers in, especially since most language-level packages don&#x27;t care what system they run on.<p>Instead, the best practice seems to be to install programming languages with the system-level package manager and install the language&#x27;s packages with the language-level package manager. That way you only need one system-level package per language, and each language-level package only needs to deal with that language&#x27;s package manager. The system package manager is responsible for dealing with system-specific things while the language package manager is responsible for language-specific things. It&#x27;s a natural division.<p>It is conceivable that there could be a single cross-language, language-level package manager. But what language would it be written in? And how would it deal with the fact that each language uses different technologies and has different approaches for installing and configuring libraries and packages?

Some hunches:<p>• while the axes would be in a virtual compass-rose – up:laudable, down:problematic, left:agree, right:disagree – the actual controls would have some distance from each other, and (if possible) from the leftmost position that Reddit/HN/etc has trained-in<p>• the agree/disagree (opinion) totals are always shown – not just net but total of each – but as a left-right sparkline-like graph, and with no effect on ranking/fading. This rewards people for those votes: they see the tally change, and thus know that they&#x27;ve been counted.<p>• the laudable/problematic (moderation) totals are never shown, but are somewhat inferrable by ranking/visibility. As with HN, site moderators might override default positioning to help set norms and cap campaigning that spills into the moderation-axis.<p>And of course, all of it is very subtle until you try to tick/hover over it – low distraction from flow of text – and much is probably hidden from new users, until they incrementally familiarize with site norms and features.",1400443711

What do you think they see when an engineer walks through the door.  They see another blue collar job that costs five times as much as normal.  True or not, that&#x27;s how management at e-commerce companies want to approach engineering.<p>Management doesn&#x27;t even understand software development.  E-commerce management is hardwired to expect a simple action-change-reaction cycle that lasts a couple of days.  You don&#x27;t &#x27;develop&#x27; software over a few months or years.  You make a software &#x27;change&#x27; and things start happening immediately with bottom line improvement in a few days or weeks.<p>Their thinking is &quot;we&#x27;re going to optimize forklift operator costs by having people work 2 hour shorter shifts and position forklifts differently so costs next week will be $x less.&quot;  Their equivalent idea of what software development is is &quot;write a program to reduce shifts by 2 hours and reposition forklifts so costs next week will be $x less.&quot;  The industry is hardwired to think of software as a tactical tool instead of a strategy.<p>Even if the company doesn&#x27;t have operations and is just a website, its still &#x27;make a change to increase conversion so that revenue next week is $x more.  Again, software is not a strategy, but a mechanical 9-5 type job.",1400443295

(meaning, unless they want to accept liability for the copyright of every piece of content on their servers).  So yes, it absolutely does work that way: you can send a takedown notice to anybody for any reason and they must comply with it.<p>The logic is that DMCA notices are sent under penalty of perjury, and people aren&#x27;t going to risk perjuring themselves just to improve their SEO or take down a blog post they don&#x27;t like.  Unfortunately, the courts seem willing to accept excuses like &quot;the automated process i use to send out DMCA takedown notices got a little overzealous&quot; as legitimate, so DMCA takedowns are now pretty much just a free-for-all for anybody who wants anything taken down.",1400443275

Muscles micro-tear (the natural process which causes your muscles to heal come back bigger) when the muscle elongates while under tension (due to an opposing force greater than the muscle generates) rather than when it contracts pulling weight up. So if you do a pullup, pull yourself up and lower yourself slowly. Same with weight lifting, pull up normally and lower the weight slowly. This discovery is still unknown by most gym trainers even though its importance is so great it should have already become standard practice.<p>I&#x27;m amazed at how many people at the gym don&#x27;t know this.

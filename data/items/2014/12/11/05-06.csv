SFO is much more reliable to fly in an out of, I should know, I flew into and out of Logan so many times and countless times flights are cancelled. By the time I&#x27;d get to SFO it would be clear blue skies and uneventful arrivals. As for MUNI vs MBTA, SF has much newer, faster trains, MBTA is like going back 40 years to rickety old trains and antiquated (but not quaint) stations. I suppose you disagree, and of course some of this is a matter of opinion, you might like your trains and you might like airport delays, traffic delays, shitty weather for 8/12ths of the year. One thing Cambridge does do better than SFO is universities. I&#x27;ll give you that.

BBC executives have already (probably) thought about whether they want to charge now or make it free now (and charge later). Its the age old question every company and startup faces -- shall I increase my reputation now and charge later or should I charge now. As its been already pointed out, BBC already has a great reputation.<p>Different business models result in different pricing decisions. Maybe BBC has determined that keeping things free globally is just not smart business sense for it because of <i>real</i> revenue foregone.<p>I believe that BBC sells a lot of its programs to channels around the world. I also believe it also markets various DVDs of its programs. BBC entertainment is also available as a paid channel in many countries. If it made these programs free on the web globally that business might be in doubt.<p>BBC is currently in a binary model which is to be free in UK and then sell its programs globally. The unintended consequence of that it ends up denying global internet users its programs.<p>What would be best, I believe, would be to provide <i>all</i> choices. For people who are willing to pay outside the UK -- bring them into a subscriber model of some sort. This way BBC can continue selling its programs to companies/channels/customers around the world and let internet users watch BBC programs, for a small cost.<p>Who knows?

I just moved to Boston recently and have been struck at how people often seem to evaluate your pedigree during introductions.<p>As negative as that sounds, I think different regions just have different ways individuals brand themselves to show value in their society.",1418274094

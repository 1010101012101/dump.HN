For instance, several 'giants' of literary criticism were demonstrably shown, because they'd ill-advisedly chosen to stray into topic areas which they were ill-equipped to handle, to be talking nonsense. One topic was mathematics where it was shown very clearly that a certain well-known 'intellectual' was manifestly ignorant of the mathematics she enjoyed quoting in support of her 'arguments.",1289127561

1879130,comment,1849619,1850410,0,0,Read_the_Genes,,,"Thank you much for crafting this finely worded commentary!!!  One point to add:<p>Many economists assume equilibrium in their models.  Often, economists will invoke [Nash] equilibrium as the resting state of the economy.  This simplifies their maths, but seems like a dubious assumption for most real world situations.  Human activity is biological, and evolving.  Economies are complex systems composed of biological entities (humans), and need not ever reach equilibrium.<p>Out of respect for the recently deceased economics genius, B. Mandelbrot, I urge brave souls to learn his two cents on the topic.",1289127389

This is a common business model in the software (or hardware) sold to large corporation.

And by extension, those large corporation just paid (a lot) for maintaining the legacy system up and (somehow) running...<p>As mentioned in another comment, this is allowing some space for better designed software where the large corporation can't find something versatile enough. The history in software is just a circular loop with a feedback input (where the innovation is coming from other companies or individuals).<p>Oracle is only playing on the field of legacy systems to maintain.

It used to be that the drugs were imported in as pure a form as possible, to reduce the weight and volume that needs to be smuggled. But what has changed today is that the Columbians no longer control the entire supply chain. Mexicans pick up the coke from Columbia and transport it themselves across the border.<p>In the 70s through to the 90s, Escobar, Ochoa and Lehder controlled everything from production to distribution in the USA (usually with Americans they hired - such as George Jung and the guys featured in Cocaine Cowboys). Today the Mexican cartels control all the smuggling and distribution in the USA - so it actually makes sense that the Columbians are cutting their product in order to increase profits.<p>I read up on Levamisole to get more information about it (its melting point is 30% higher than coke - molecular mass of a third more) . I was looking into this speculating that the reason it is used as a cutting agent could be because it isn't picked up in purity tests that the cartels use. For some reason the CDC and DEA are finding it (perhaps because they explicitly test for it) while the Mexican cartels are not. It is also suitable to use as a cutting agent since it is metabolized into a compound that has similar effects to amphetamines (which have also been used to cut coke with previously). The article suggests this, as there is currently no easy test kit for Levamisole.<p>Second part I would speculate on is that Levamisole is somehow finding its way into the production process unintentionally. It could be that livestock in Columbia is treated with the drug (de-worming etc.) and that the labs are contaminated because of the fertilizer used, or because of some other part of the process.<p>Nowhere online does it mention the quantities of Levamisole found in the cocaine, which makes it difficult to speculate on the source. If it was one part per thousand, you could narrow it down to contamination or impurities passing through, if it was 1 part in 5, you could argue that it is a cutting agent.",1289125791

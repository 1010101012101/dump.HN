9748914,comment,9747131,9748872,0,0,kwantam,,,"It seems reasonable that if a person wants to donate to charity, that person might also want to expend some mental energy to optimize the way in which she does so.<p>For example, if I know that I can afford to give only $5 to charity, it does not seem particularly like a &quot;dick measuring contest&quot; to hope that, with a little thought, I might be able to make that $5 go further. Imagine that I can either give the $5 to a charity with an 80% overhead, or I can give the $5 to a charity with a 20% overhead. All else equal (i.e., assuming the two charities do approximately the same good with their non-overhead dollars, by whatever metric I wish to apply, including some abstract sense of personal fulfillment), my $5 seems self-evidently better spent on the 20%-overhead than on the 80%-overhead charity.<p>Consider the zoo for which you&#x27;re a donor; if you could spend a few minutes on some activity that would double the amount of money you could give to the zoo each year without otherwise costing you any money, would you <i>not</i> do it? In other words: do you actually care about the outcomes of your charitable work, or are you just doing it because there is some minimum level of action at which you feel good, irrespective of the outcome?",1434772596

9748906,comment,9748678,9748678,0,0,davismwfl,,,"Maybe,  maybe not.<p>I worked with a guy as a contractor where he swears he was a Steve Jobs.  Realistically, all he was is a guy with lots of ideas and no follow thru. So he wasn&#x27;t a Steve Jobs at all and most all his visions totally violated good design principles.  When I would point that out he would say because his thoughts were visionary and not yet known.<p>Yea, and I fart unicorns dancing and rainbows.<p>In the end, you have to evaluate for yourself, but in general if people don&#x27;t have a loyal following, but expect that type of respect they are no Steve jobs.  I have had some AMAZING leaders, and they inspired us to do great things.  They would never spend only 4 hours on a project they believed in, and they would expect more from us.  I am not saying you should quit tomorrow, but I personally refuse to help feed anyones ego like this.<p>And I am sorry, the idea of just doing it without getting some design guidance seems really stupid.  I know the stuff we read about Jobs says he didn&#x27;t need mock ups etc, but I totally think that is BS.  He was a smart ass guy who likely had tons of mock ups before he ever said go to the next step.  Reading his book, he commissioned projects and prototypes that showed design but weren&#x27;t yet functional (IIRC), so no that isn&#x27;t a Jobs type mentality, that is a God mentality and is just idiotic.<p>BTW no real leader publicly humiliates his team, it is counter productive.  Yes some great visionaries have done it, but in todays world we know that is a bad idea and to nurture not humiliate people, so its just BS.  BUT that doesn&#x27;t mean you don&#x27;t push them hard (which can be a fine line) and demand better from everyone.",1434772359

9748903,comment,9746051,9746051,0,0,sago,,,"I&#x27;ve played with GA for a while, bought a couple of books, enjoyed the math, experimented with writing my own library. But, as TTProgram&#x27;s comment, I&#x27;ve yet to find an application where it clearly improves on high-school vectors.<p>I&#x27;m aware that Geomerics purportedly used it for doing global illumination calculations, but there was scant specifics (understandably) about the actual implementation. So we don&#x27;t know in what capacity it was used.<p>I&#x27;ve heard it praised for physics applications, but I haven&#x27;t seen anyone walk through, say, a simple rigid body simulator and show its improvement.<p>I&#x27;ve heard it spoken of as the future of ray tracing, but again I&#x27;ve not seen anyone willing to put an implementation (even a toy) up against a ray tracer that you could write in an hour with Gibb&#x27;s vectors.<p>On the contrary, when I&#x27;ve tried to use it, the complexity of GA just makes it impractical. The problem with 4 or 5 dimensional GA for doing work in 3D, is that we end up dealing with 16 or 32 values per object (if you unify vectors, bivectors, etc), or else having five or six specialised forms of object  plus their combinations (if you keep them separate), with potentially hundreds of specialisations of basic operation. This isn&#x27;t just me, the GA libraries around have this bloat. I&#x27;ve just not found an application in which that massive increase in storage, computation and implementation complexity is worth it.<p>Which makes sense. In a regular vector based system, we might use vectors and quaternions (2 things) to model rigid bodies. We can do a lot with those. But it isn&#x27;t clear what thing is difficult or inelegant to model with them, that a trivector/scalar would be the right tool for. So that extra flexibility to be able to store such exotic mathematical objects is a waste for computer and programmer.<p>I came to the conclusion that GA-advocacy at the moment is mostly a true-believer type thing. True believers will <i>tell</i> you over and over how important it is to modelling 3d space, but rarely <i>show</i> you a worked example of it being easier. I am not cynical enough to think it has no killer applications, but I&#x27;ve yet to find them. And I would dearly love to.",1434772244

Your other example of Australia has only 24 million people and I&#x27;m sure it suits the country&#x27;s needs well. However, in larger countries like India(1200m) America(322m) and Brazil(202m) an electronic solution might be better.<p>If implemented correctly (ie without fraud), there are huge potential benefits<p>* Cost savings. India&#x27;s general election cost the taxpayer $600m and state elections will cost a similar amount. If there are early elections, the cost is repeated.<p>* Turnout. Right now certain sections of society in any country are more likely to turn out, to the detriment of democracy. A large part of election campaigning is getting people to turn up to the booths. This is so hard that rarely are the turnout percentages higher than 60%, which is a pitiful number. If we could make it simpler and quicker to vote, this would be less of an issue.<p>To be honest I don&#x27;t know how we would implement such a system.

Took days to crunch numbers after it was written. Anyhow, looks like an imaginary city skyline, right?<p>Going from left to right, lets call it the X axis, are various diagnostic codes used to prescribe medication.  So on the left side it&#x27;s like code 400, on the right side 500. In between is 401.3, and so on.  Been awhile, so can&#x27;t remember the exact numbers but bear with me. The drugs range from opiates to diflucan for yeast infections, to whatever else.  So you kind of see a distribution range that&#x27;s normal.<p>On the Y-axis, are years.  Here&#x27;s the slightly confusing part of the graph: I striped 4-5 clinics worth of data on that axis.  So on that axis, only 6 years of data are shown per clinic. What shows up after the first 6 long rows is a different clinic, and so on.<p>The Z-axis is a frequency of prescriptions.  Like, how tall a tower is means how many prescriptions were written for a particular medication, by a particular clinic, on a particular year.<p>If you look at the nearest 6 long rows, that&#x27;s 1 clinic, 6 years of operation and you see nothing but flat lines. No yeast infections, no eye drops, no steroids.  Just some really insanely tall towers.  One of the towers gets clipped from the graph because it&#x27;s that insanely taller.<p>The tallest towers were the most expensive drugs and treatments that the government reimbursed the clinic for, so they took a shortcut and just went for those.  The kicker is that they only got caught when we started investigating.  There was a tip. Someone reported something weird about the clinic.  So, we went up to the state and asked for an anonymized data dump of the clinic in question, and then absolutely nothing happened. The state stalled for 6 months before finally giving the data up.  Turns out, they were only alerted to the fraud after we asked questions about the clinic, and they wanted to take corrective actions before disclosing anything to us so that it didn&#x27;t seem like they were sleeping on the job.<p>I don&#x27;t know what to say.  I get it, this stuff is complicated, the data sets are huge, and there are more blindspots than you&#x27;d think. Lack of oversight is too strong of an accusation for me to wield, but there was definitely a fear of criticism. What I&#x27;m trying to say here is that computational detection is only a small fraction of the real issue. The bigger issue is the guarded cultural environment in which all these agencies exist, and without intimate knowledge of how they work and what is possible, there&#x27;s no silver bullet.",1434772002

In defining a concept relating to people, a plausible one will include terms/metrics/observations relevant to people.  This implies a continuous domain (as opposed to a discrete one) much like what exists in analog systems.<p>Attempting to apply binary &quot;yes/no&quot; requirements and/or tests when faced with a partially observable universe doesn&#x27;t work.  Which is why AI agents use heuristics such as &quot;confidence factors.&quot;  And a person with which an organization has little to no history with presents a partially observable universe often limited to their CV.  Now, a computer program has to do approximations such as confidence factors because _it_ is a digital entity (assuming a Von Neumann machine[1]).<p>But we, as human beings, are not Von Neumann machines.  We are analog.  Which implies continuous domain metrics (IOW: a &quot;spectrum&quot;).

In some of my early product management/project management roles, I would wave my hands write a few emails, one-pagers and expect the developers and designers would grok the vision and build something beautiful. Surprisingly, in my first experience, the outcome was wonderful -- the product was beautiful. At that time, I was naive and vainglorious enough to believe that the reasons for it were my &#x27;vision&#x27;. The actual reason was a team of world class ux designers, visual designers and developers, who understood what I needed and created the product. The creative vision was theirs. So in some sense your boss is right, he doesn&#x27;t have a unicorn team who can translate his day dreams into product.<p>On the other hand he is also profoundly wrong. Skip a few years, and I started up on my own, and could no longer afford those unicorn designers and developers. Now mere vision was no longer sufficient, I had to deal with actually firing up Photoshop and Illustrator and going from there all the way to writing HTML/CSS/JS, even the backend python for a prototype (Fortunately, I&#x27;ve always loved coding.) The learning was profound. Translating vision(even your own, leave alone others&#x27;) into attractive product is a difficult skill that every serious product owner must understand. And they can only do so by doing (they may never master it). I&#x27;m not anywhere as good as those unicorn UX/devs I worked with in the past, but I compensate for it somewhat with, meticulous communication, verbal discussions, wireframes, mocks, sketches, functional prototypes, whatever, to get the product I want. Then I iterate the hell out of it by getting feedback. Learning to interpret subtle signs of friction in a users&#x27; experience was hugely valuable. The results have been good though slow.<p>If your boss is refusing to acquire the requisite translation skills, you will need to acquire them (and you will probably be the gainer in the bargain)<p>My advice to you here is to do the following:<p>1. Ignore the public shaming, if possible, and focus on your boss&#x27;s message. Iterate on design concept despite his demeaning you for mistakes. It may eventually make you the unicorn developer/designer. At the very least even if you realize you don&#x27;t have a talent for design, you will understand where your own limits lie.<p>2. Understand that the kind of people your boss is looking for do exist. They are not easily found, and are usually very expensive. So help your boss find one if possible. Learn from these people.<p>3. When you&#x27;ve gotten these skills, please email me your resume. :-) (Just kidding)",1434770150

The ideal case would be that you don&#x27;t even have to think about whether they have the information or not, the system should handle that with very high reliability.<p>You&#x27;ve also taken &quot;decision&quot; differently than I meant it. I meant, why do you have to decide to transmit the EKG, not the decision about which hospital to go to. Repeating myself, it would seem to be an improvement if you didn&#x27;t have to pay any attention to whether the appropriate hospital had access to any readings/recordings that you had (I would think it would be better if it were trivial for someone there to pull them up, of course with high reliability).<p>I&#x27;m not feeling around for some opportunity to innovate/improve, I&#x27;m just curious about the factors that such a system has to deal with, and which of those factors are less idea than they could be, and why.

391011,comment,390413,390656,0,0,drusenko,,,"this is really interesting to me -- i spent a lot of time examining implied and actual volatility with regards to option pricing right before an earnings report. the short and skinny is that (as makes sense) volatility rises right before earnings are released and falls right afterwards. if you know that volatility is going to rise, you could easily plug the rest of the numbers into the black-scholes model and find undervalued options. they weren't always there, but at times, you could find options that would lose less in value due to time decay than they would gain due to the increased volatility with enough volume to not start making the market -- a great arbitrage opportunity.<p>unfortunately, i didn't have as much time in college to study this as i would have liked, and all of the good volatility data seems to be hidden behind a pay wall (bloomberg stations!)<p>one thing is for sure: even though the market approximates efficiency, there are still arbitrage opportunities to be found in the right places.",1228802338

Web start-ups struggle with the question of whether to sacrifice revenue for several years, build a huge audience and then sell them ads, as YouTube did
>><p>Hmm, my recollection was that Youtube built up a huge audience and then got acquired by Google, which runs them as, essentially, public utility.  (They spend more on costs than they recoup from ads but they get the cross-subsidy from AdWords like, well, every other Google property.)<p>For those folks who can't cross on perpetual cross-subsidization and don't want to play the ""get acquired before we are destroyed by the economics of hosting terabytes of content that we don't own the copyrights to"" game, could I suggest, say, charging money for value?

""#"" comments don't evaluate their ""arguments"", don't terminate at semicolons, and you can't redefine the meaning of ""#"" with ""proc"", so ""#"" <i>is</i> special and reserved — just in fewer contexts than in other languages that use it as a comment character.",1228801435

SIMD will be obsolete!""<p>And every single time, a few years pass, and it never, ever happens, because CPUs don't get faster in a vacuum.  Just as much, our demand for performance increases.<p>In fact, right now, I'd say that the demand for performance is outpacing CPU development.  The CPU requirement for 1080p H.264 from a Blu-ray disc is easily 20-40 times greater than the video from a DVD.  CPU's haven't gotten that much faster in the meantime, forcing graphics card makers to add hardware acceleration, just as in the earliest days of DVD playback.",1228801238
390995,comment,389692,389733,0,0,tlb,,,"Actually, you should expect fraud rates to be high, but not because potentially legitimate customers are ripping you off. It's because when a fraudster gets a new shipment of stolen credit cards, he wants to test them out online before, say, walking into Best Buy where he might get busted for using a card reported stolen.<p>So you're not losing revenue, since these guys weren't going to pay you for your SaaS anyway, and you're not losing capacity since they won't actually use it. So what's the problem? The problem is that chargeback fees (that you pay them for the service of taking the money back) can be $25 or more.<p>If it becomes a big problem, you'll probably find ways to detect common fraudulent usage patterns. For instance, since your variable cost is zero, you might avoid putting through a charge until they actually use your service.",1228801126

390988,comment,390540,390961,0,0,tptacek,,,"I have no idea what your first paragraph means.<p>Your second two paragraphs are mostly subjective. I also think you've staple gunned your design sensibility to 2008; Java (for instance) is over 10 years old. Do you think that in 2018, you'll be hand-carving computed jumps and manually re-ordering instruction sequences just to decode video? If Perl isn't decoding HD video in 2018, I'm going to be disappointed.<p>Clearly, pure interpreted runtimes are giving way to ""modern"" (ie, ""standard in academia since 1995"") native code runtimes. Java has been there forever. Along with the cost of proving out and converting developers to a verified x86 plugin, you also need to factor in the fact that virtually every browser in the world has Java, and is an auto-update away from a much better JVM.<p>The real issue is, I don't think anyone's going to care about this.

Doing collections costs them a lot, and they lose some to cardholder bankruptcies. They do provide a valuable service of isolating you from all these. Taking checks probably costs you a larger percentage of revenue than credit cards.",1228800446

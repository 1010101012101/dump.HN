6869163,comment,6866652,6868558,6,0,reeses,,,"> Ironically, I actually terminated my career as a software developer because I was developing RSI and found the work rather unsatisfying (despite really enjoying programming work in general). Working as a tradesman has so far proven to be far more satisfying and far better for my health - plus it leaves me free to work on my own projects after hours rather than forcing me to leave them unfinished since I already spent a full day working inside.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is really that ironic. Sitting in a chair for 8-14+ hours a day, focusing 25&quot; in front of your face, slouching, pushing your hands into an unnatural position and tweaking your ligaments and tendons, and being stressed about maintaining a level of production is exactly what I would prescribe for physical degeneration.<p>Throw poor nutrition and little to no exercise in the mix and it&#x27;s amazing how atrophied the back muscles get. Constant headaches from misusing the trapeziuseseseses and other muscles around c7, lower back pain, pain between the shoulders, this is all the type of back pain that gets &quot;blue collar&quot; workers depending on various analgesics and narcotics.<p>The fact that it&#x27;s preventable is especially worrisome, as it&#x27;s just as hazardous as shorting live voltage down your arm.

Conjecture is that the root cause is confusion between a terrorist organization &quot;Jemaah Islamiyah Malaysia&quot; and a professional organization &quot;Jamaah Islah Malaysia&quot;.<p>Inability to fly to return to Stanford/Silicon Valley has obviously caused a lot of complications and trouble for her, which can be interpreted as monetary damages, and she has filed suit for compensation, and also to be removed from the no fly list.<p>A few days ago, the government appears to have prevented her daughter (a U.S. citizen) from flying to America to testify about it.  The government claimed in court that they did not prevent her daughter from flying to America with the no fly list, but apparently the airline provided the daughter with a copy of the no fly order.  Generally, the airline is instructed not to provide said orders to the traveller, so the traveller has no way to know why they aren&#x27;t allowed to fly.<p>This sort of lawsuit is difficult to make - the government has argued it should be dismissed because she can&#x27;t prove the problem is that she is on the no fly list.",1386484383

In fact, being focused can be the best way to prove an in idea, get money (revenue or risk capital) and scale to other platforms.<p>(2) They did not add value. In effect, Demand Media was an arbitrage of digital adspace. Arbitrages get spotted and, eventually, disappear or diminish.<p>The dependency on another business & the lack of value add makes me wonder how they got as big as they got and just why they did not fail sooner. Of course, I hate to see any companies fail, given the risks of entrepreneurship & positive economic benefits (it makes the economy antifragile).",1386484125

6869140,comment,6865980,6866648,0,0,yeukhon,,,"Patent is what keeps research institutions running. The only reason MIT gets so much every year is because they make great research and companies are willing to do joint research with professors. And for smaller, less competitive research institutions, patents help finance department. Grants are great but on top of grants departments can do better with revenue coming from patents. You&#x27;d be surprised how many a department can make on top of grants by just having patents. The IP director at my institution came to my class and talked to us. One postdoc made an impressive method on some neuroscience stuff and his invention would have been worth hundreds of millions to him and to the department. He was only able to get US patent not international patent only because he published his work to a journal.<p>Patent has good and bad. We need to balance the two. And believe it or not, when you face a lot of competitors, if your invention can drive them out, you&#x27;d want to patent that. This is just how business works. If patent is bad because everything should be open, then military inventions should be open too. It might sound extreme, but patent is the weapon businessman uses.",1386483977

6869126,comment,6866201,6867524,1,0,ollysb,,,"Admittedly it&#x27;s a fairly advanced usage for analytics, but the limitation we&#x27;ve found is that you can only use one value as a unique identifier e.g. you use a user&#x27;s account number as a unique id for a visit but then if you want to calculate the conversion rate in a funnel all visits by that user have the same id and so there&#x27;s no way to calculate the conversion rates per visit. It means you have to choose your events and properties incredibly carefully and often it means you have to record the same events multiple times with different values just so that you can run the calculations in the right way. This would be fine except that mixpanel isn&#x27;t exactly cheap per data point.<p>Beyond this the other major sticking point is that you can&#x27;t update data points. You have to get them right first time otherwise you need to blow the whole database away and start again. Depending on your requirements this can be an absolute killer. We&#x27;ve now resorting to using a version id in the event names so that we can blow the old series away (via hiding) and then repopulate using fresh data, far from ideal.<p>It&#x27;s really frustrating because overall I think mixpanel has a fantastic product. Not being able to update data points and only being able to use one property as a unique identifier is proving to be a real PITA though. People have been asking for these things for years as well and there just doesn&#x27;t seem to be any willingness in the team to address these fairly fundamental issues.

(no affiliation) I consider it to be a great platform for reading technical books at an affordable price. (access to latest editions, etc.)<p>The &#x27;Head First&#x27; book series includes books for Python and Django as well as many other programming languages. You may also find that a good design patterns book will be valuable to your CS career.<p>I&#x27;m gonna assume you are aware of such online learning platforms as Codecademy, Khan Academy, Udacity, etc. These can be good starting points depending on your level of proficiency with basic syntax.<p>Beyond these recommendations, I&#x27;d say study open source code and code libraries.",1386482722

It is hilariously sad how badly designed sites were 12 years ago. &quot;Hacking&quot; emails was something so easy that a 12 year old kid with little knowledge of html could do.<p>I started learning CSS and newer HTML(back when I learnt HTML code was written in all caps) when I was 17 to earn some money to buy me books and a laptop for university. Did some Java in highschool and built small applet games. Then I learnt php at my first coop job(go UWaterloo!) learnt Javascript, Jquery, C# at simultaneous coops. Finally learnt Advanced Javascript(rather how to write javascript right) and fell in love with it and beyond that just kept improving my skills in online development. I keep them refines by working on multiple side projects.",1386482621

He didn&#x27;t have a ring to give her as he couldn&#x27;t afford a diamond, which she knew. She took the stone from him and suggested they make a necklace out of it.<p>Now, not every girl is as cool as Christine, but they have the most interesting engagement jewelry of anybody else, and a story that goes along with it which is better than &quot;I looked for the right diamond for ages...&quot;.",1386482593

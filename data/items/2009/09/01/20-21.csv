Yes, the HAWIK would be the usual child IQ battery in a German-speaking country. I'm not following the statistics shown there completely, but I note the sample size.

Periods certainly predominate in variable names everywhere, the reason being (as I understand it) that the underscore is synonymous with the assignment operator <- in S-Plus--pretty hideous. Verbing and camelcasing your function names is a bit outta left field, most functions tend to look like variables (indeed, technically they are.) Maybe it's not such a bad thing to distinguish them. kConstantName I definitely don't like, reminds me too much of Hungarian notation and CONSTANT just makes more sense and is more common.

The whole point is that <i>outside</i> the abstraction stuff breaks, and the kicker is that in many cases, the only practical way to know what is inside the abstraction and what is outside the abstraction is to know the details about the underlying abstraction, exactly what it was supposed to help with!<p>Yes, cutting the network cable is a poor example, but there are many good ones. With C, you can do stupid bit manipulation in ways that will be non-portable across architectures. With ORMs, an easy example is the N+1 select problem.<p>ORMs are typically very leaky, in the sense that to write good quality code, you have to know the details about how your ORM works, and they usually aren't a 100% replacement  for knowing SQL.  The more you have to know about how the level below you works, the more leaky the abstraction.<p>I think Joel's could have made the point clearer if he had distinguished between how much typing the abstraction saves you, and how much knowledge it absolves you from knowing.",1251838400

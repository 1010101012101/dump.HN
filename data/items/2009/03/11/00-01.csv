511035,comment,510559,510639,0,0,Shamiq,,,"I'd buy in, but not blindly and not without documentation. Honestly, I don't know how the legalities would work. As to the rest of your questions....<p>Take this as you will:<p>Going public actually serves more of a function than just getting an inflow of cash. For example, it can give existing shareholders of a company more liquidity -- it is difficult to figure out a price to buy and sell stocks of a company that isn't publicly traded, but relatively straightforward for a company that has marketable shares. I think venture capitalists call it an exit.<p>But there also exists a case where a company would like the added publicity that comes from offering an IPO. Especially in the currently frozen IPO market, anyone going that route will make a large splash (even more if they belly flop).<p>It's been stated before, but selling equity is considered the most expensive way of raising money: you're giving away ownership and control in exchange for cash. As much as you can, you'd prefer to get money from loans and bonds, but that isn't always an option. If your balance sheet and income statement are weak, a creditor may not give you the loan you need, or may charge an exorbitantly high interest rate. It really depends on your individual situation as to what you want to do and what the market will let you do.<p>Yes, there is risk involved in going public, but good advice should help you minimize this risk. Say you're Big Company A that's privately owned. When you decide to go public, you call up the investment bankers and ask for help. They'll hook you up with the large investors (hedge funds, pensions, etc) and work out ways to protect you from the downside. One of these methods is called the ""Green Shoe"" (named after a company). Basically, you allow for an overallotment of stocks you're going to receive. Then, the investment bank borrows this overallotment (typically 15% of what's going out) and sells it to other investors. Now, when the IPO is going through, therAPPINSDRMWB19222e already exists demand to buy this stock -- the investment bank needs it to return to original stock holders. Here's how the mechanics work: If the stock price goes up after the IPO (it's so-called well received), then the bank buys the stocks from the company and everyone is happy. If the stock price goes down, then the bank buys from the people who are selling -- creating a demand, and helping to stabilize the price.<p>There's a lot of fun financial stuff in there, but I hope that answers a bit of your questions.",1236732500

Just an over generalization/stereotyping at its worst.<p>I am a good hacker, and yes I use an IDE  (eclipse to be exact).  I have to code java for living  (mobile), and I think I am one of the earliest developers in java,  and i used to use Textpad, and Vim at my early days.    I guess, in your eyes that makes me a ""better developer"",  but the truth is that some IDEs really make your life easier.  Much easier.<p>In mobile you have to re-invent the wheel over and over again.  From UI, to basic things as a string tokenizer,  and it is impossible to memorize everything  (some of your team memebers implement different functionalities).  IDE's auto completions are very very useful.  Also the refactoring facilities and debuging tools are really useful.<p>I do use Vim for programming in LUA  (does it make me cool?), and I really miss a lot of these tools.  Simple things like variable highlighting, jump to definition are missing, and it makes the code a pain to read (especially if it s not yours).  If you decide to  change a variable name, good luck, you have to do string search/replace, and the potential for errors is huge.<p>While a good programmer HAS to be comfortable and good in command line, just because they use an IDE doesn't make them less of a people.<p>And the best programmers  I have had the chance to work with  used IDEs.  These guys implemented a LUA VM in J2ME from scratch, in a couple of months.<p>I have noticed that this really shallow and douchebag-y attitude comes from people that use mostly Ruby.

I'll post it for the sake of the question at the end.<p>I would be willing to look at -- or at least let co-exist -- more ads with the content I view, if those ads respected both my interests and my needs.<p>+  Don't move.  Ever.  No exceptions.  (And no bleeping music, either.)<p>+  Intrigue me with appealing <i>information</i>.  Tell me what, concretely, you propose to do for me.<p>+  Don't move!  Don't think it's cute to slip in an animation after waiting a bit.  I don't care if it's the ""Firefox girl"" from Daily Tech News.  Don't move.<p>+  Don't be more garish than the encompassing page design.  I am only frustrated by people who think ""Hotdog"" is a legitimate color scheme.<p>+  Don't track me.  I'm not interested in a ""more extensive relationship"" with your marketing efforts.  Concentrate on delivering a tolerable, appealing ad for <i>this impression</i>.  I'm sorry if you feel this hampers your effectiveness; as far as I'm concerned, you're putting your effort into the wrong end of things.  I may be willing to flex on this point, but you'd better make it <i>real clear</i> how you are protecting my privacy, with an iron clad commitment, and provide me controls for turning on and off the tracking.<p>I've learned of some useful things from ads.  And I don't mind a respectful presence on the page.  Ads in print newspapers?  No problem.  Bouncing monkeys on a yellow banner -- big problem.<p>What I've been wondering about, recently, is why no one has tried to organize a codified and instantiated compact between browsers and publishers/advertisers.  E.g., as a browser, I'll let this class of ads through -- probably provided by a set of whitelisted URL's.  I understand doing so helps to support this site that I value and may offer me additional, useful information for consideration.  In return, you promise not to violate the above (or whatever the set of rules ends up being).<p>Perhaps this is to say, ad brokering should be a two-way communication and not a one-way communication.

511017,comment,508957,510941,0,0,micks56,,,"Thank you for reminding me of patents. I forgot to mention those. A patent is a completely different entity compared to case law. Case law and case briefs/motions written by lawyers have to be short, concise, to the point, and logical. The judge will quickly (in a matter of a few seconds) ignore your argument if he has to spend any time figuring out what you have to say.<p>That leads all of our law professors to drill into our heads brevity, clarity, and conciseness in everything we write. But as you mentioned, patents have a completely different audience and goal.<p>I am amazed at what is patentable too. I wrote a research paper arguing against software patents. The professor that graded my paper disagreed with the position very much. I wrote mine a few days before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard the <i>Bilski</i> case. When the decision was rendered this past fall they made some law that is similar to what I argued. I should go show the professor the paper he marked down and the <i>Bilski</i> decision. But I digress...<p>Patents are a land grab. The goal is to get the vaguest, broadest patent possible and protect the most space. And the legal-speak is there because those words have been litigated time and time again and they have a known meaning to the courts. As soon as you write a new phrase you open yourself to debate in front of the court. A macro to convert legal-speak to human-readable prose should be used at the researcher's own peril.<p>We are told time and time again: read the case for yourself. Do not read anyone else's summary. And don't paraphrase words unless you know to stay away from the special ones.<p>Example: There was a contracts case where the contract says ""only use pipe made by Company A to build my house."" The builder uses pipe from Company B. The court ruled against home buyer because ""only use pipe by Company A"" doesn't actually mean that! It means use pipe similar to the quality of Company A! So translating the legal speak required to really get a builder to use pipe from Company A into ""only use pipe from Company A"" will result in failure.<p>The information is hyper-linked very well. I wish I could show you, but I can't. My student access to the site is restricted to school use only. I am pretty sure I will be violating the TOS by posting any of the information.<p>But every case cited is linked. Those are the most important. Judges are linked to other decisions. Same with arguing lawyers. Statutes are linked. Footnotes are linked. Obscure terms are linked. For example, a medication will have a link but a legal term of art will not.<p>I just wish the search and the site overall were faster. Sometimes the navigation is quirky, too.",1236731398

511008,comment,509978,510178,0,0,azanar,,,"The first of your two objections is perhaps a confusion of the word best practice. It doesn't mean ultimatum as much as it means something seriously worth considering.<p>What constitutes ""one thing"" is a judgment call, and it varies tremendously as should be evident from all the other replies here trying to define it concretely. I imagine the definition changes a lot depending on how one's catalog of discrete things change. The point is not to define this ""one thing"" for you, it is to get you thinking about it.<p>A lot of the best practices that have been put forth are the empirical outcome of repeated judgment calls by others. They notice a trend in their own practice, and put it forth as being more of an emergent principle than a coincidence. They might evangelize some, but it is a sign they are excited about the idea. It doesn't mean they don't know there are drawbacks; they might want to float the idea first and see if their concerns are legitimate. If I floated all of the possible drawbacks of ideas I've had, I'd probably scare people away, even though I overplayed a lot of them.<p>Oh, and for the second objection, there is data. I don't have it in front of me, but I <i>believe</i> that Steve McConnell cites data within Code Complete about the length and scope of methods relative to error rate. Granted, one citation does not constitute proof, but it's a sign Uncle Bob isn't alone on his soapbox. :-)<p>But then, the point of all of this evangelizing, really, is to get you off auto-pilot, and thinking about your work, not to give you the definitive answers to everything. That you asked this question shows you're thinking about it. Work hard to keep doing this, it's more important than any rule or best practice.",1236731016

The vast majority of people who have thought about this believe time to be emergent, not fundamental. Hell, the Hamiltonian function doesn't even have time as we know it. So in my opinion this individual has some serious credibility issues.<p>That said, he does make some good point on this particular issue about minor's rights. Maybe lower the voting age to 16? Like if you are old enough to drive, you are old enough to vote. Of course this would be good for the GOP since children engaged enough to vote at that age would often be copying their parents, who could be Rush Limbaugh ""ditto-heads"" or the like.

While it is cleaner, the BSD version requires very many more jumps (4 times more if I remember correctly, I haven't looked at glibc in quite awhile).<p>The glibc version is written in such a way to minimize the jumps in the assembly and therefore produce faster code. Besides reading 4 bytes at a time, it does some clever (and very nontrivial) ""magic."" But again, all to reduce the number of jumps.",1236730595

That being said, I'm better at finding things <i>wrong</i> with stuff than <i>right</i>, so here's my feedback.<p>I thought the ""Try it Now"" meant I get to sign some sample document... or preview an account where I could upload a sample document and make-believe send it out to people.  Just <i>something</i> where I get some instant gratification.  Making me create an account just to try your product is a killer, for me, at least.  I have no real need for this service so I don't feel inclined to sign up.  That might not be the case for somebody who actually has an interest in paying for this service.<p>You definitely need a sample account, or some more pages showing what I get when I pay you.  I want to see this before I even sign up for a free account.  What's the interface look like to send it out to people?  What do they see once the document is sent to them?  How do they actually sign?  Just show me the process and pics of your interface and I'll be more confident in creating an account.<p>Best of luck.<p>Edit:  I actually scrolled down to see the nice 1. 2. 3. 4. process.  Move this up!  It's far more meaningful than a big document with a rather ugly ""John Bellingham"" signature that, by the way, instantly made me think ""signing with a mouse must look hideous!""",1236729876

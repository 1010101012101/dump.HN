My question: Why on earth would Google want to cede any significant chunk of the personal transport value stream to Uber - or acquire them at a $40Bil+ valuation - when the main (only?) semi-uniquely valuable thing Uber have (a large network of drivers) is worth approximately zero dollars in a self-driving vehicle scenario. Uber are valuable and effective in a human-driven vehicle model because they have achieved critical mass in the pool of human drivers on their network, and are in a position to grow that pool. In a self driving vehicle model critical mass of vehicles/drivers is available to anyone with a decent line of credit.",1422939553

8988922,comment,8977393,8979111,0,0,TomFrost,,,"Coincidentally, I had a demo call with Sumo today. I was very impressed, except for one point that makes Splunk the clear winner at the moment: I can send structured logs to Splunk and it automatically finds the keys and allows me to query on them immediately.<p>Meaning, I can send:\n2015-02-02 01:00:00 event=&quot;Product sold&quot; price=5<p>And with zero configuration in Splunk, I can now query: event=&quot;Product *&quot; price>2 | stats sum(price)<p>And in the next iteration of my app, I could add 30 more key/value pairs to that message and could query on the rest of them just the same, no configuration.  It makes development incredibly rapid to be able to instantly report on any metric anyone on my team logs out, debug-related or otherwise, without having to maintain some master list of every key in every log message in every service we write.<p>I was floored in my Sumo call today when I was told that wasn&#x27;t the case in that product yet.  It seems like such a basic feature-- and is why many products have switched entirely to JSON-based logs.  Have you discovered a workaround, or find that to be as cumbersome as I&#x27;m anticipating?",1422939444

We have a majority hold over most of the movement of products in western Canada (one of the main drug ports to North America). I have researched your site and the concept seems interesting to me (as long as it is anonymous as everyone makes it out to be). We produce LSD/nBome/Ketamine/MDMA/Meth/GHB and import cocaine and heroin in massive bulk amounts.<p>> I’ve looked around your site, and the prices are absolutely absurd. I’m assuming most people on here selling are 3 or 4 tiers below the actual producers or distributors?<p>> 1M a week sounds like it would be worth selling on here, once we know exactly how everything works. Even if commission was 15% it would not matter, as we lose more than 15% doing it on the streets with street level guys getting robbed or arrest and losing product etc.<p>> Also, we have kidnapped friendlychemists partner Xin already and are on the hunt for friendlychemist.<p>> We are all familiar with PGP as we have been using it for years via email linked to our smartphones. It’s the only way we communicate with each other aside from in person, since phone calls are not secure.<p>> After some “questioning” he admitted he was intending on moving to a different country and setting up a new seller account on this site. We don’t take too kindly to thieves. He’s gone.<p>> If you have your mind set on just finding his location, I can talk to them and get them to get it for you for a fee (not sure what amount as usually when we hunt someone, there is more involved after we find them).<p>> I can almost guarantee it, but I stop short of guaranteeing anything unless I am 100% certain I can get the job done. I do that so I don’t look like an idiot if I can’t accomplish something I have said I can.<p>I mean... for a supposed Hell&#x27;s Angel hard-core drug dealer that&#x27;s never met this anonymous online person and only exchanged 5 messages... they seem a little too open and forthcoming. Also, PGP on your phone? What app are they using for that?<p>If this conversation is real, I have an inkling it was LE on the other end posing as &quot;Readandwhite&quot; (part of the reason none of the persons supposedly &quot;hit&quot; every turned up on any missing persons reports or their identities ever really found).<p>Clearly Dread Pirate Roberts was into some bad stuff here, but it seems... off, a bit.",1422939425

Of course, a non-profit housing organization is not going to have the technological sophistication of a tech company, but if you have a set of skills that the organization doesn&#x27;t have and needs, then you&#x27;re not going to be treated as a second class citizen.

I called the IRS over and over again and was unable to ever get to speak to anyone.  It literally took 5 phone calls to figure out how to get into a queue, and then it had a two hour wait, and it&#x27;s only open 9-5 so it could only be done during the work day.  I&#x27;m lucky: I have enough money that I just hired an accountant to tell me what to do and the result was that the government ended up giving me <i>back</i> over $1000.  Alternatively if I hadn&#x27;t responded within 90 days I would&#x27;ve forfeited my right to appeal it at all.  For so many people they need to take an entire day off of work just to wait in line, either on phone or in person, just to figure out what the issue is.  Hopefully they can fix it on the same day and it doesn&#x27;t end up costing them another day off which can put their job at risk.  There is so much mind boggling inefficiency and it really ends up hurting the poorest people the most.  So don&#x27;t feel like you have to be some kind of NSA supporting, jingoistic jerk to work for the government.  There&#x27;s important, non-politically-controversial stuff to be done there that can have a big positive impact on peoples&#x27; lives.",1422938922

This was huge. Think jumping from Window 95 to NT or to Unix/Linux. Awesome things like multi-user system, reliable systems with multiple processes starting/stopping that could run for more than 3 days without rebooting. This is what makes the world run today in general computing.  In programming languages paradigm there is ... (sorry, if this is dissapointing) only Erlang. You can add its friends (Elixir, LFE and few others running on same VM).  Yap, the only one I know that has built-in heap isolation and light tasks (a couple of K&#x27;s of memory). The non-programming language specific paradigm is of course OS processes, with some messaging. Now you can call them micro-services living in containers to be cool and that&#x27;s fine. But is really nice. You&#x27;ve caught up with OS technology finally.<p>[+] : One kind of in-between is semi-pre-emptive multi-tasking and that is when pre-emption happens implicitly during certain system calls (usually IO calls like socket.recv() or say disk.write() or time.sleep().

That is, the epistemic view requires that reality behaves quantum mechanically when no one <i>is</i> looking at it, whereas what we observe is that reality behaves quantum mechanically when no one <i>can</i> look at it.<p>These are completely different situations. In one case it is what we <i>do</i> know that matters--which is an epistemic state--in the other it is what we <i>can</i> know that matters, which is an ontic state. And it turns out that reality does limit what we can know, and this has dramatic consequences.<p>The clearest example of this is the heat capacity of solids. Heat capacity is a measure of how the temperature increases as you add heat energy to an object. The temperature is just the average energy per state in the material, so the heat capacity is a very direct measure of the number of states the collection of particles constituting a material can be in.<p>It is very simple to show that particles that <i>cannot</i> be distinguished have a different number of states from particles that <i>can</i> be distinguished even if they don&#x27;t happen to be at the moment. For example, consider two coins: if they can be distinguished they have four possible states, HH, HT, TH and TT. If they can&#x27;t be distinguished then HT and TH are the same state (because there is no way, even in principle, even if you&#x27;re god) to distinguish the left coin from the right coin. So there are only three states.<p>You can do something similar with particles in a crystal lattice and show that they are indistinguishable. So it isn&#x27;t a question of what we <i>do</i> know, but what we <i>can</i> know, and that is determined by ontology, not epistemology.<p>The problem is that the ontology of the wavefunction is non-classical in the extreme. Because it is nonlocal it violates the law of non-contradiction from the perspective of locally causal beings (us). That makes it hard to understand, but it doesn&#x27;t make it any less real. It just means reality is weird, which at this point in history shouldn&#x27;t come as a huge surprise to anyone.",1422937145

Many of these have degrees in management from Ivy-League, law school. Many complete fast track course from hacker school, GA and/or any other make-it-quick school.<p>What&#x27;s your take on hiring such candidates ? I have experienced in last 2 years that these people somehow make it through interview process  ( sometime in name of diversity) but lack core skills. They lack in-depth system knowledge that is necessary while writing applications.<p>Not sure if we are truly getting into bubble now. Unfortunately, bubble burst will affect everyone. \nI am part of technical interview committee along with 12 other members. On number of occasions tech committee recommendation of not to hire is overturned by HR and higher ups. \nI felt bad that deserving candidates ( both male and female ) were turned down in favor of these whacky-get-rich-quick one.<p>I know some people on HN are already part of this group so I want to be clear on couple of things.\nI have absolute no objection on self-learning process. I have more respect for such people.\nHowever, doing 3 month course just because Ivy-League or law school and claiming I am most deserving one is not something I appreciate.<p>Why tech sector keep itself shooting in the foot ?<p>These 3 months like school are already tried in India ( Google NIIT courses ).

I&#x27;m just sayin.<p>It&#x27;s true that a developer using a tool doesn&#x27;t say anything about their skill level, but as the author points out, those perceptions become reality so... yeah.

It would be very satisfying. I&#x27;d say Nobel prize and forever in history books satisfying. Unfortunately (as i myself is on the ERP side and came to a something like pivot wave on my own while trying to explain the double-slit) there is no reasonable explanation for observed Bell&#x27;s violations except for the explanation by QM (which for a &quot;realist&quot; like me sounds just like &quot;will of God spreading FTL&quot; :)<p>Note: actually i haven&#x27;t been able to find good (for my criteria) Malus law verification for single photons - the law is the basis of Bell&#x27;s violation claims in photon polarization experiments. Slight modification of the law on top of Einstein&#x27;s proposed modification - with resulting law being pretty reasonable for single photon situation while still preserving classic law in the case of classic light ray - actually produces the Bell violation in the classic &quot;local realism&quot; explanation.

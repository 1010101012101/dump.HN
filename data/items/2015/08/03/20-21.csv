Just as in Israel and India, Mexican entrepreneurs develop a grit early on as they defy the immeasurable odds of functioning in a business environment riddled with corruption, insecurity and monopolistic uncertainty.<p>Even the seemingly data-based parts are useless without comparison to relevant data from other countries, for example:<p>> The huge internal market potential is undeniable unless, somehow, the millions and millions of Mexican smartphones will never buy or bank.<p>My interpretation that this is a rant stems from the personal attitude with which the author has written with, indicated by lines such as :<p>> China and India’s hottest venture-backed startups are mostly copycats.<p>He sounds personally upset that the bigger VCs preferred China and India to Mexico. I think a better path would&#x27;ve been to actually do the research, write an article with citations and statistics, and <i>prove</i> that he is right.

Societies are self-organising to some extent, especially in their local cluster. e.g.<p>Suppose you have a room full of 5 people building a bridge with legos. They&#x27;re a small group and thus benefit from say the agility small teams provide. They finish their lego bridge in record time & live happily ever after.<p>If you need to provide lego bridges for 10 people though then you&#x27;ve got a choice: you can stick 10 people into the room and make them build a bridge twice as big, or you can have two rooms each building their own bridge in close proximity & benefiting from the speed of small teams.<p>Thats a simplification sure, but I feel societal structure (e.g. the mindset that makes canada&#x27;s healthcare work) are to some extent imprinted in the people & thus apply regardless of the size of the border on some random map. If you stick another hospital on a map in Canada it&#x27;ll work just as well.<p>As a side note, not convinced about the big company thing either. It can certainly be like that, but well managed its not inevitable.

The US has an interest in its world view and values being shared by the rest of the world and uses its economic power to get other countries to agree, at least in part, to enforcing that world view and values. They are <i>not</i> however (in general), asserting that decisions made in the US apply in other countries (except to our own citizens, wherein enforcement of the local US law is still at the discretion of the foreign nations while our citizens are within their borders).<p>If the US were to assert global jurisdiction for a decision made in a local (i.e., state or federal) court it would be equally unfounded.

If you mean the one that comes with the OS, then wouldn&#x27;t that by dynamic linking?<p>Re-deploying the binary, and getting the updated binary are two different things. When OpenSSL has a vulnerability, they announce it after the fix is out, distro maintainers release updated packages, I run `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` or equivalent. It is on OpenSSL and the distro maintainers to release the update, and on me to apply the update.<p>When we are talking about static linking, it&#x27;s now suddenly on the software developer to release a new binary or on me to rebuild the binary I have from source. Now I have to keep track of (a) which dependencies each project uses, and (b) which vulnerabilities come out. Not being familiar with Go, does it have such dependency tracking framework where I can update all packages where dependencies have been updated? Of course once I know that I need to perform an update, it doesn&#x27;t matter if I run `apt-get upgrade` or `go build foo`.<p>As for logging, I advocate doing both. I really should make a separate blog post about it, but here&#x27;s what I expect a well-behaved daemon to do:<p>- Always start in foreground and log to stdout (otherwise it seems like it exited without any output)<p>- Use the -d and --daemon flags to go into background<p>- Use the -p and --pid options for specifying the PID file<p>- Use the -l and --log options for specifying the log file location (if not specified or is - use stdout)<p>- If uses a config file, use -c or --config for the location of the configuration file.

You will also have a larger teaching load. Good luck getting a good research grant -- I hope you have a great professional network. Expect your research to be reviewed a bit more strictly, because no respectable journal wants to publish an also-ran.<p>Now that the reality check is complete, let me make some pro-active suggestions:<p>- If you are any good at all at ML, there are many organizations with interesting problems who will snap you up in two seconds flat. You just need to be good at ML and have a way to demonstrate that.<p>- As far as learning goes, find the people you want to work with and figure out a way to work with them. There are a handful of researchers who have a surplus of talented people who want to work with them, but most researchers are starved to find people who are both talented and passionate about their subject. If you can be that person, they will find a way to make it work. It might be on a grant, it might be as a grad student, it might be something else -- just roll with it.<p>- If you can&#x27;t make Coursera work for you, then I truly wonder about your motivation. What do you think you will get from a &quot;proper degree program&quot;? Most of your professors (at good universities, at least) will not want to hold your hand -- quite the contrary. From my perspective, the best grad students go to professors for suggested readings and to answer questions when they come to a (relatively rare) road block in their autonomous learning. Outside of that, peer networks are peer networks.<p>I think this is enough for now -- feel free to ask follow-up questions.<p>As a side note, I get the sense that some of your issues/challenges are being fed from the psychological side (e.g., what does it take for you to be &quot;satisfied&quot;).

These grants are usually denied, and so each group of researchers scrapes up their own little partial datastore and ships graduate students and postdocs back and forth from the uni to the Cern/DeSy/Fermilab/SLAC/wherever, sometimes with suitcases full of tapes on the return trips. I&#x27;m a little surprised that it&#x27;s still a problem for them.",1438633573

It wasn&#x27;t uncommon to discuss airfoils, drag buckets, laminar/turbulent flow, flight dynamics, etc. I met luminaries in the aerospace industry and became friends with many of them at model airplane meets.<p>We knew our hobby is dangerous. We have seen or suffered injuries. And we&#x27;ve crashed many aircraft. And behave accordingly. This means membership in the Academy of Model Aeronautics and one of thousands of clubs around the nation. AMA comes with rules and clubs enforce them. It also comes with liability insurance. We don&#x27;t fly outside the club&#x27;s official flying field.<p>Then drones happened. A hobby of enthusiasts with rules became a free-for-all. Anyone could buy one and fly without skills, rules and a social contract. We now see them flying above crowds, roads, airports and fire-fighting aircraft.<p>This degree of irresponsibility, carelessness and lack of consideration does not reflect well on who we are as people.<p>It&#x27;s a disaster we are watching on TV waiting for bad things to happen. Dropping a drone on an infant is no different could kill them. No different from using a gun. A full-scale aircraft accident could kill hundreds. Yet &quot;normal&quot; people think nothing of placing others in danger with drones. Why?<p>The solution wont&#x27; be easy. Perhaps a ban on flying outside approved flying sites, a $10,000 fine per incident and 1 year in prison? I hate over-regulation. Yet if people won&#x27;t behave with civility there might be no alternative.<p>We don&#x27;t need to control all drones owners, just those who might tend to behave without civility or care. That, to me, means flying only within approved sites unless a permit or license allows one to do otherwise.",1438632881

This adds up to over 100% obviously but the point was that to be good at bonsai you needed to have at least two of those things down pat. The biology is interesting, (just kind of stream of thought here) although I was pretty  young at the time I remember there being a great deal of interest in soil mixes, and special types of fertilizer which allow the tree to be healthy while also staying small. I was also taught to think of the root structure as a mirror of the visible part of the tree, and in some ways more important than the parts that you typically see. You can recover a tree from pruning its branches but if you over prune the roots it will likely die, similarly you can&#x27;t let the roots overgrow because they will get over crowded in the small pots. Also certain species of tree with different root structures required differently shaped pots. Grafts were common, sometimes you might desire a tree that does not grow well in pots but you could achieve the same thing by grafting a branch of one species onto the root stock of another but this was difficult to do because you can end up with ugly scars or a contrast between the two types of bark. Another thing I remember being interesting is that some fruiting trees will produce miniature fruits, or miniature flowers.",1438632478

I also created a USB drive to do a clean install, during the weekend I replaced the HDD with an SSD and put a new RAM stick in it. Windows 10 was installed from the USB stick and was properly activated with those hardware changes without having to input any type of product Key.<p>So yeah, bad on the tech support guy, but I don&#x27;t think this will be an issue for gamers who constantly change RAM, video cards and hard drives.",1438632192

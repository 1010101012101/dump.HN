That is how I did it. If you get the information before a realtor does you can avoid issues of conflicting interest, data rights etc. The MLS data is covered by license agreements as you would expect so you need to get to sellers before realtors do. That is my experience at least. Getting to sellers first is not that hard if you have a good mailing list that buyers and investors are interested in. Building a good mailing list is damn hard though.<p>Where are you located? I am looking for help on the programming side (I am a programmer as well). I would love to crush MLS and make it irrelevant. I hate it and everything it is.<p>Also, MLS data has yearly costs. I did not want to pay so I get access to the sellers first.

FB very well, at some point or already, may maliciously intrude on you. But the vast majority of horror stories arise from the kind of behavior of users and their friends that cannot be prevented by any (non draconian) social platform.<p>In other words, the privacy problems arise from people being <i>social</i>...if you want maximal privacy, then the only solution is minimal sociability. This is the case with online networks as it is at e water cooler. So finding a privacy-protecting platform -- that is, the kind of privacy that most people want -- is like finding a way of gossiping that prevents words from being repeated and secret pacts in breakable.<p>* an example comes to mind: recently on another FB thread, someone said how FB nearly destroyed his marriage because his fianc had, as her profile pic, a photo of both of them before the relationship was known to the family. fB is obviously wrong to revert privacy settings, but thhe relationship should never have been broadcasted in any pictorial form, because any ""friend"" could CC or refer to the photo regardless of FB privacy settings",1354650849

It's neither possible nor desirable to <i>eliminate</i> it outright.<p>It wasn't until recently (a couple weeks ago, when giving a presentation on FP) that I realized <i>why</i> stateful programming lends itself so easily to evil. If a program is a serial collection of possibly unrelated stateful actions, everyone can add new intermediate behaviors to a function to satisfy some dipshit requirement, and the API doesn't change. Writ large, this allows silent complexity creep.<p>I think a major reason why FP is better is that changing a purely referentially transparent function requires an API change: more parameters or a different return type. If nothing else, this tends to break tests. It's hard to change functions that already exist, and it <i>should be</i> hard. You should be writing new ones instead. Also, if there's only one way to combine programs (function composition) it's easier to break them up. So you don't get the 500-line monsters that plague enterprise codebases.<p>That said, the worst thing about OOP isn't state. It's <i>inheritance</i>, which is the 21st-century goto.",1354650217

I love F# and I've written some fairly pointer-intensive code with it, but the CLR's code-gen is pretty bloody abysmal[1]. F# does more optimizations than C#, but most of the heavy lifting is left up to the CLR/JIT (obviously).<p>In fact, I find I have to experiment with F#'s inline feature for high-perf code, because the CLR optimizer works far better on big functions than inlining/optimizing calls to smaller ones. Even simple stuff like removing a tuple allocation is not done. Even basic things like eliminating the allocation of a tuple when it's obvious you're immediately deconstructing it is not done. F# doesn't even lift lambdas, as of 2.0.<p>F# doesn't even do fusion like Haskell, so for high-perf code, you're often giving up nice functional code and resorting to loops and mutability. Just check the F# stdlib implementation.<p>So while I really do love F# and enjoy writing in it, ""faster than C"" is not really applicable. A: You'll be writing C-in-F# (which is fine, if most of your app isn't that way), B: the codegen isn't remotely competitive with a modern C compiler.<p>[1] Edit: OK, that's an exaggeration, but I mean in comparison to what you'll get out of a C compiler for equivalent, low-level code.",1354650197

If a service doesn't show you ads, and doesn't charge a monthly fee, how do you think they make money? Either they're not, so they'll go out of business when their VC funding runs out, or they're selling whatever they can glean about your habits to third parties.<p>---<p>Additionally, the article conflates two very different concerns under the banner of ""privacy"".<p>If you object to advertising, then many free services also have some sort of paid tier. Send then $5 a month and they stop showing you ads. Problem solved.<p>If you're concerned about third parties having access to your data, then your only practical options are to either host everything on a computer you own, or encrypt your data before it leaves your desk. Both options are significantly more complex than using free hosting, but can provide stronger guarantees about the safety of your data.<p>The advantage to encryption is that you can decide on a file-by-file basis whether it's important enough to protect. Maybe you're OK with Dropbox/Google/Box.net/etc being able to see pictures of your cat, but don't want them to see your tax documents or medical records.<p>Of course, the main problem with taking security seriously is that you are placing yourself into a very small, difficult-to-please market segment.

Especially because it becomes clear very fast that from a technical standpoint, the software is horrible. Unencrypted communication with the remote, no auth or integrity checks and so on. Also, a lot of data is sent over a proxy in the US.<p>The results were published in various newspapers, among them the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ, a very big and well known newspaper) who printed one page of the trojans source code. The headline was something like: ""You cant understand this language but this is what controls your everyday life"".<p>Im very glad that we have an institution like the CCC here in germany.

Or anyone?<p>Because it's pretty clear that people can and do project without any data. For example, Apple hadn't sold a single phone, and Steve Jobs went up on stage and said that Apple expected to sell 10 million iPhones.<p>Apple did ZERO market research. It was basic Jobs saying, ""yeah, this'll sell"" based on his own estimation. And it did.<p>I'm not Steve Jobs, but I also don't need historical data to project sales into the future, and be reasonably accurate when doing so.<p>What I do, and what I suspect Jobs did, is (a) see if the product/service resonates with me personally, and (b) most importantly, see if there is a narrative for the product/service that can be communicated to, and accepted by, large numbers of people. If I can't develop a narrative, I don't believe the product/service will succeed and I work on something else.<p>The ability to determine a narrative that'll work ahead of time is what makes the forward-looking approach work. If you can't do that with any kind of consistency, you should do Ries' approach, IMO.<p>I'm a writer/filmmaker at heart, and have spent many years getting good at story/narrative.

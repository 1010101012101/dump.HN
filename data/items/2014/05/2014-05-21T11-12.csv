It keeps more of the traditional OO style and syntax - you <i>can</i> use scalaz and write scala that looks like Haskell, but you can also write code that corresponds line-by-line to java, whereas with Clojure you&#x27;re forced to make a more immediate leap to the lisp-style syntax, immediately stop using inheritance, and so on.",1400673551

7777724,comment,7777323,7777635,5,0,Jach,,,"Indeed having a chain is often nicer than a lot of nested stuff. And when your base language is an abstract syntax tree, it becomes pretty easy to write a macro to let you flatten a lot of things out (among a bunch of other neat things). If your complaint with a lisp is that there&#x27;s too much nesting, you haven&#x27;t seen enough lisp. Pretty much every lisp has an infix-math library somewhere, for the popular lisps there&#x27;s probably at least a dozen, and they usually allow mixing in prefix-math as well because nuts to typing &quot;a + b + c + d + e&quot; when I can just type &quot;(+ a b c d e)&quot; or if I want to call functions anywhere in the middle. There&#x27;s no reason you couldn&#x27;t write your example using a threading macro in Clojure, assuming your functions are defined such that they take input explicitly as the last argument instead of reading a common stdin. (Or if they take it as the first argument, you use a different macro but the same syntax.) Your code just becomes<p><pre><code>  (->> (command) (grep &quot;error&quot;) sort uniq (wc :-l)\n</code></pre>\nDoes anyone think (wc :-l (uniq (sort (grep &quot;error&quot; (command)))))\n is a better option? And instead of typing that out manually, I just used the REPL.<p><pre><code>    user=> (use &#x27;clojure.walk)\n    nil\n    user=> (macroexpand-all &#x27;(->> (command) (grep &quot;error&quot;) sort uniq (wc :-l)))\n    (wc :-l (uniq (sort (grep &quot;error&quot; (command)))))\n</code></pre>\nEven without macros you can still setup nice-looking chaining with generators and coroutines. &quot;Too much nesting&quot; seems like the wrong complaint.",1400673402

7777714,comment,7776107,7777258,9,0,gjm11,,,"Which is of course rubbish; events like the sudden fall of civilization, large-scale nuclear war, all governments on earth suddenly declaring very large computing or storage facilities illegal out of paranoia about runaway AI, etc., are surely much more probable than 10^-11 per year and have the potential to wipe out S3 entirely.<p>It&#x27;s arguable that all of these are sufficiently major events that if any of them happens you won&#x27;t <i>care</i> that you just lost all your data stored in S3 because you&#x27;ll be too busy fighting off wolves, dying of radiation sickness, or whatever.<p>More to the point, though, I take it the real point of these many-9s guarantees is that if you store a very very large number of things on S3 the danger of losing one of them is still very small. So, for instance, if you store 10^8 objects in S3 then the probability of losing any of them in a given year is allegedly about 0.1%, which is actually fairly credible. (But when that happens, a substantial fraction of the time it&#x27;s because of a really major disaster and you probably lose a lot more than one object.)<p>We could do with more precise ways of describing availability guarantees, to distinguish between a small probability of losing lots of data and a large probability of losing a tiny amount of data.",1400673205

Considering that you &quot;have a working knowledge of Java (but really don’t like it)&quot;, I think Scala is a good choice.<p>The usual cliche-but-true reasons:<p>A. It runs on the JVM, arguably the most performant VM.<p>B. It has mature, huge (Java) ecosystems. High quality IDEs, rich (3rd party) libraries, a plethora of build tools (for better or worse) and profilers.<p>But for me personally, the things I like about it:<p>1. I can use different languages (as long as it runs on the JVM, obviously) for different needs. Probably not wise to mix a dozen languages (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages</a>) in a project, but at least I have a choice.<p>2. Since I&#x27;m a Java developer during the day, I can reuse my skills (can use same framework, same debugging approach, same build system).<p>3. I can start coding with Java/imperative style. When I started learning Scala, I literally coded like in Java, minus the semi-colons. Over the time, I enhance my coding style because I keep thinking, &quot;There&#x27;s gotta be a better way of doing this.&quot; At least this lowers my barrier to learn Scala.<p>EDIT: IntelliJ allows you to copy Java code and paste it as Scala.<p>Obviously you can replace &quot;Scala&quot; with &quot;any JVM language other than Java&quot;, but I have my specific reasons in choosing Scala (over, say, Clojure).",1400672466

In fact, it is (IMO) very bad style to nest $(). When people complain about Lisp syntax, it&#x27;s only partially about the RPN or the parens, its about the incredible amount of nesting.<p>Funnily enough, of all things bash offers an alternative paradigm. Instead of nesting, you use filters:<p><pre><code>    # pseudocode\n    echo 2 | mul 5 | add 4\n</code></pre>\nFor example, you can write:<p><pre><code>    nerrors=$(mycommand | grep error | sort | uniq | wc -l)\n</code></pre>\ninstead of:<p><pre><code>    # pseudocode\n    nerrors=wc(&quot;-l&quot;, uniq(sort(grep(&quot;error&quot;, mycommand))))\n</code></pre>\nI find this paradigm of &quot;do A, then do B, then do C&quot; much easier to think about than the nested &quot;do C on the result of doing B on A&quot;. I wish more programming languages would embrace that kind of coding, which is basically functional, but in imperative or data-flow order. You have aspects of that in C# (LINQ), SQL, and some others.

And JavaScript does not have a regular syntax, so even if it did have macros, you would have to special-case each type of syntax (curly braces, statements, post-++ operators within lines) and handle them specifically.

3306315,comment,3305013,3305013,1,0,pessimizer,,,"I think the problem is the quality of the deliberation of ""deliberate practice."" There are metaskills, such as reason, logic, understanding of cause and effect, statistical analysis, etc. that effect the acquisition of all skills, partially through the method of improving the efficiency of memory. If you learn one skill that has five objects, consisting of two transformations of two of those objects into another two of those objects, and three relationships between those two resultant objects that result in the fifth object, you've just learned a complicated skill. But if you've learned how to find potential isomorphisms between those objects, transformations, and relationships and other objects, transformations, and relationships in the world through the use of reason, logic, understanding of cause and effect, and statistics, and how to vet them well, then each further discovery will immediately generate skills that weren't possessed before, and some of them may even be novel. Without the ability to recognize those isomorphisms, each skill would have to be learned separately, and remembered separately. It's like the difference between languages like Old English, where to pluralize a word or to create a possessive would require learning another word, and normalized languages like most of Modern English or the Romance languages where you can just apply a transformation to words that you already know. In the leap from Old English to Modern English, English speakers were given a gift of an expanded memory.<p>I hope that didn't sound like word salad.<p>Basically, if I had to get by on sheer memory, I'd be screwed, because mine is miserable. What I can do is reason to the same place under the same conditions often enough that my memory will eventually leap there out of habit. To get good results out of this requires a strong foundation that sadly both isn't formally taught or emphasized in our educational system (outside of mathematics and the hard sciences), just gleaned through the sheer effort of having to memorize an enormous amount of information. I don't deny that some genetically predetermined concentrations of proteins in the brain could give you a leg up on this, but I deny that any brain that has all of its pieces couldn't possibly outperform every other brain on this planet in any particular area.<p>I operate under the assumption that advances in reason will be made and distributed during millennia to come that will give the average 10 year old the equipment to understand within a day things that would have taken a person in the early 21st century a dozen lifetimes of what counts as ""deliberate practice"" now.<p>We invented language to spread information and ways to reason about that information, and it's worked. First we spoke it, then we wrote it, then we manufactured it, now we're almost bathing in it. If we manage not to 'splode ourselves within the next 100,000 years, we should be as advanced in reasoning over our current selves as our current selves are over who we were 20,000 years ago. Why 100,000? I'm assuming diminishing returns because of the discoveries that we sometimes make of walls like quantum physics, where we discover things that are even theoretically unknowable. Probably a primitive assumption:)<p>At this point in time, we jump to mystical theories of the undetectable secret superiority of the successful, after defining superiority as being successful (at the rate of gaining returns with practice), which is completely circular logic that discounts ""deliberate practice"" as a skill in itself.<p>The author shows that actual numbers bear this out.<p></rant><p>He's got a lot of other interesting articles about the dynamics of deliberate practice.

3306314,comment,3303796,3306190,1,0,tszyn,,,"Your reply conflates two things: copyright and big labels. The control of artistic expression landed in the hands of big corporations because only big corporations could handle three expensive things: 1) production, 2) distribution and 3) promotion. All three of these things have recently become way cheaper thanks to digital tech. Big labels are becoming less powerful every minute. It is now perfectly possible for an unsigned band to produce their own recordings in a home studio, sell them on the Web and promote them on the Web as well. If copyright is abolished, this will no longer be possible because the band will no longer have any right to profit from the use of their songs. Even if a million people love their song and listen to it every day, they get zilch.<p>In short, I see the big label problem, but the problem was never copyright. The problem was expensive production/distribution/promotion.<p>""They don't have a natural right to be compensated for the work they want to do.""<p>Copyright does not give people the right to get compensated for what they want to do. It compensates people if they make something that other people want to use.<p>I don't want to talk about ""natural rights"". I find the notion fuzzy and suspect. I think it only complicates the issue at hand.<p>I would like to live in a world where people get rewarded when they contribute to society.

I've seen svn users copy and paste entire directories just to ""snapshot"" their work. With git and local commits, you don't have this problem.

A few years ago, this company built a custom web application for a local business in a small niche market (estimated 600 US and Canadian companies in the industry). Since then, we have converted it into a subscription-based product to sell to the rest of the companies in this small market. Many businesses hate the existing solutions (there are only a couple) and are looking for something better.<p>So far so good, but I think they're doing something wrong.<p>If a company wants to try out this software, they have to call our sales guy. Mr. Salesman will get their account set up and hand them the login info.<p>There is no product website. There is no signup form. They market this application from a Twitter account, Facebook, and a blog. There are also no plans down the line to build a website or signup form either.<p>When I asked why, in this day and age, we don't have these web app basics in place, and why they aren't even a priority, the reasoning I got was something along the lines of...<p>""If we offer frictionless trial accounts, our competitor (who presumably has more money than we do) will undoubtedly see what we have and steal our features.

It is not too hard to see how many legitimate carrier questions could be answered to the benefit of consumers by having phones log data. Perhaps the simplest one is ""Where do I have areas of weak coverage and so more dropped/distorted calls?"" If a large percentage of the handsets can log GPS + signal strength info over a long period of time, the phones that are in suitcases (erroneously recording poor signal strength) and those in airplanes (erroneously recording great signal strength) will be balanced out by real world scenarios. Given 12 months of data (which covers various weather conditions, and correlating by date) one could quickly and efficiently decide where additiona transmitter/receiver resources should be deployed, and under what conditions it might make sense to bring up more resources and when you could shut them down (rain for example absorbs 1.5 - 2.5 Ghz radio signals.<p>Of course that information can be accumulated much more painfully by driving around in a van to pick up this information. And the quality will be both better and worse, better in the sense that a signal-quality-van could have equipment to evaluate the signal strength very accurately, but worse in that you wouldn't get the time of day and conditional variation from weather.<p>The 'attractive nuisance' aspect of it however comes into play when you've created a logging/monitoring <i>platform</i> and now you can collect other kinds of information. Like warrantless wiretappers who are unable to restrain themselves from listening in on conversations they have no reason to listen to, once the infrastructure is there the humans in the loop seem unable to prevent themselves from succumbing to their desire to 'know.'<p>I had a long discussion with some law enforcement types at a security conference along these lines (I was advocating outright bans on some of the tools they consider 'essential' for fighting crime). The economic cost of not using the tools is higher (higher taxes (to pay for more cops), higher phone bills (to pay for signal strength vans)) and, until it is actualized, only a ""potential"" risk of abuse.

Any improvements in that direction would be, at best, marginal.<p>However, there is <i>one</i> thing that could really be improved: typography. The default setup is not particularly good for English text--manageable but subpar--and is even worse for Russian.

The LaTeX books were significantly easier to read than the Kindle ones--I think they were even a little better than what I expect of most paperbacks.

This is a great way for a team of engineers to work together and have a continuous release process.<p>Meaning, you deploy trunk and do development on 'iterative branches' (ie: you have branches called iteration-0001, iteration-0002, iteration-0003, etc...). All works happens on the iteration branches which are then tested and merged to trunk on a regular basis as part of the release process. If you have work that spans more than one iteration, you make a branch off the current iteration.<p>Unfortunately, subversion has a very hard time keeping track of development that way. The reason is that if you (and your co-workers) want to work on another branch off of the iteration branches (so you don't hold up a release), then merging changes from the iteration branches into your branch become a nightmare because merge tracking on your branch has no way to know what is happening on the other branches. If you don't do it right, you can end up with a branch that can never be merged back.<p>The way merge tracking is handled is a central design failure of Subversion. I made a long blog posting about this a while back: <a href=""http://lookfirst.com/2011/04/subversion-mistake.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lookfirst.com/2011/04/subversion-mistake.html</a><p>Git handles all of this beautifully.<p>So, while today, you might not need the extra functionality of git, it is good to have a tool which can support your needs in the future.",1322866867

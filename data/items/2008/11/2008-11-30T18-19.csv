Merely writing them down doesn't do that.""<p>Almost all of the most important intellectuals in the history of western civilization have had one thing in common: their ideas were wrong. Plato, Piaget, Copernicus, Einstein, Lamarck, Chomsky, Adam Smith, etc.<p>If testing ideas for truth value were really the hard part then scientific experiments wouldn't be replicable and science would have no more weight than astrology. Furthermore, scientific beliefs wouldn't run in S-Curves and progress would be linear and continuous.",1228071465

380994,comment,380558,380787,0,0,deathbob,,,"Well the IBM position sounds like it would be kind of an easy transition, that I would not be thrown into anything too tough right away.  NOt that there aren't challenges there, but I would be able to ease into it a bit.  Bug fix here, documentation there, slowly and steadily work up to more difficult problems.  Which is fine by me.  But ultimately it sounded like their main stack was windows and java.  I'm sure they've got *nix boxes and python doing things, but the main stuff would be in java on windows.<p>Now this may be stupid, but to me, right now, I would rather learn more about linux and python than java and windows.  In 3 - 5 years I would like to be a python wizard, not a java wizard.  Is that short-sighted?",1228070628

While this wasn't one of them, there are certainly times.<p>And on that point, that's the feeling I get when I read this article.  The writer is <i>trying</i> to be direct and ride the fence of ""condemnation by realization"" but only comes off as wrongly crude.  While I haven't read any of Gladwell's book, I've seen him speak and he's got his wits about him regarding these things.

</sarcastic><p><i>Unlike Qi I, Qi II allows you to embed sequent rules within functions, evaluating them to closures. These rule closures are type checked and are permeable to having their variables lexically bound from outside the scope of the rule itself. These devices enable the student of computational logic to effortlessly code complex logical systems of all descriptions. Thus the rule<p>let PTerm/X (replace-by X Term P)<p>PTerm/X, (all X P) >> Q;<p>____________________<p>(all X P) >> Q;<p>allows universally quantified assumptions to be instantiated to new premises. This rule can be embedded into a Qi II function called all-left which does precisely this job. The rule is turned into a closure by the rule function which is then applied to the problem (list of sequents).<p>(define all-left<p>{term --> [sequent] --> [sequent]}<p>Term S -> ((rule let PTerm/X (replace-by X Term P)<p>PTerm/X, (all X P) >> Q;<p>____________________<p>(all X P) >> Q;) S))</i>",1228070387

I value pg's essays much more - he is not going for the daily quip, rather, his essays always treat something new in perfect fashion. Gladwell and Godin could be writing daily columns for womens/mens magazines, saying the same things we all already know over and over (yet we like to read them for our daily motivational boost).

The small firm said they use python specifically because they found PHP programmers to be so different in level of skill, and that python programmers were consistently pretty high.  I can't vouch for any of that, but to me, it does say that they're concerned about hiring good people and not just anybody.

380973,comment,380825,380825,0,0,potatolicious,,,"This won't work like Seth wants. The problem is the following:<p>- Few users have the iPhone hooked up to a car charger when in their cars.<p>- The GPS receiver sucks up power like mad when it's on. A constant connection will drain the battery very quickly.<p>- The iPhone is also incapable of passively uploading GPS data to a remote source, nor is it capable of running an app in the background. This is to say, your users must keep their iPhone unlocked (disabling auto-sleep) and your app open <i>at all times</i>. This is similarly a large drain on your battery.<p>The amount of work (buying a car charger, making sure to hook it up, unlock the phone, and open your app, and disable auto-lock) every time the user needs to use the service is just absurd. This has no chance of working as it is.<p>It's a cool idea, and if we all had devices in our pockets that can, without excessive hackery, sustain a continuous GPS feed to a 3rd-party source, this would actually work.

380971,comment,380495,380892,0,0,gruseom,,,"No idea why someone would downmod that but I have neutralized them. :) ""Undiscovered"" is of course a relative term. I'd cite the languages of Arthur Whitney here: they're ""discovered"" enough to have made a lot of money, but are unknown to the vast majority of the computing world and widely misunderstood even by those who have heard of them. Qi isn't absolutely ""undiscovered"" - here we are talking about it - but it's largely unknown and unused.<p>Tarver strikes me as a smart guy doing serious work in an intelligent way. For example, building Qi on top of CL (in such a way that you can drop in to CL whenever you want, though this point is redundant) seems like an obvious win. I don't feel a need to use something that right now, but I'm also skeptical of the ""I don't feel a need to use that"" feeling... perhaps we are all Blub to Qi!",1228068144

1282,comment,1178,1178,0,0,hwork,,,"Shawn, I too am very interested in improving the classroom experience using the web.  You might want to check out my buddy Mark&#39;s post on creating a viable blackboard alternative:  http://www.markmcgranaghan.com/2006/12/16/idea-lightweight-blackboard-alternative/<p>He outlines pretty well the costs of maintaining blackboard for college campuses (very expensive) vs. the quality of its product (not so hot). <p>For some feedback, I think the automatic grading system is interesting but incredibly difficult to pull off.  Teachers have a huge, vast array of testing practices and to create a system to easily check them  would be very time-consuming.  Maybe it&#39;ll work for very small cases, like multiple choice.<p>Also, building on top of other suggestions, I would separate the features from the reasons for making them.<p>",1172526514
1281,comment,1178,1178,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"I am a current user of Blackboard, but only under duress, and would heartily welcome a replacement written by someone who actually cares about software. Under their model, even if you write the best software, it is likely that no one will care, since the users of the software (teachers and students) are not the people who select the software (administrators). Multiple professors at CMU have commented that Blackboard is a system designed to annoy professors and otherwise not accomplish anything that couldn&#39;t be done via email and normal websites. All of my best teachers have rejected it. <p>This means that if you do, in fact, write even passably good software, teachers might spontaneously decide to use it. However, from there I&#39;m not sure where any revenue would come from. ",1172525308
1280,comment,1225,1272,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Markets being more efficient means that customers know better what is actually going on, and marketroids have less influence over their perceptions. Sure, there are still horrid inefficiencies, like the 1000% markup on eyeglasses, but 19dollarglasses.com and the like has begun to close that inefficiency. It isn&#39;t that marketing has changed media, like the expansion into TV advertising from radio and paper; it&#39;s that marketing fundamentally is waning in effectiveness as people have more ways of communicating honestly as people, rather than as marketing departments. <p>As a result, the startup looking for potential customers not only doesn&#39;t need a huge distribution organization, it doesn&#39;t even need to get good at &#34;modern marketing techniques,&#34; since most successfully marketed products, particularly on the internet, have succeeded because they were better, not because they used hip new marketing techniques. Even PR is ineffective at penetrating actual blogs, although it still has an effect on old-style newspapers that have been webified. ",1172524276

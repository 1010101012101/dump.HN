I&#x27;m also not comfortable with teaching children that becoming a sex worker is as good a career path as any other.<p>We as a society need to maintain a balance between protecting everyone&#x27;s rights, and allowing people to have their own personal tastes and opinions.  This balance should be based on enforcing the most basic laws that guarantee a person&#x27;s right to life and safety.  Gay people should be free from threats of violence.  But so should everyone else, including groups who will never be considered as oppressed by liberals, like nerds in high school.  As for tastes and preferences, this isn&#x27;t something we can decide in a top down way.",1385747917

At the moment under the circumstances I live in, and trying to keep the discussion simple and plain (yes, there are complexities - establish the baseline & ground rules and proceed to fine details on your own), for sake of argument I&#x27;ll accept the USA legal poverty line (which any guaranteed basic income would match) as equalling basic human income need (despite it being 20x world median income, adjust figures as you see fit) and ignoring inflation for the moment, we get about $30/day. Fixing the dollar to 1/30th of what basic normal daily needs costs seems sensible; a machine reducing those costs by 10% would indeed play havoc with the vast relativities of currency economics, but for sake of discussion let&#x27;s just say <i>whatever</i> it takes to meet basic daily needs, that cost is pegged at $30 (or vice versa).<p>Yes, it&#x27;s hard to discuss this as all the factors are so danged squishy. I&#x27;m trying to get a handle on them (hence my above post, which was mostly me just ruminating out loud). The real value of anything, insofar as outside human existence nothing has value, is based on the basic needs for sustaining daily existence - a value which I&#x27;m enumerating as &quot;$30&quot;.<p>As for hijacking, methinks this is a quite sensible response to an article suggesting most people shouldn&#x27;t work because the highly productive few should just carry the weight of everyone&#x27;s needs without compensation.<p>As for &quot;taxes == coercion&quot;, I mean that in the most objective way. Taxes are, in fact, paid under coercion: if you don&#x27;t pay, you&#x27;ll be made to suffer. You may pay those taxes with the gladdest heart and complete consent to the system it enables, but the coercion is still there.",1385747532

It&#x27;s generated like that XYZ, where X = some random number, Y = zero-padded userid, Z = increasing number for that account. If a user visits this page, a new order is created in the background with status &quot;unprocessed&quot;, or the same order number is used again, if it wasn&#x27;t &quot;completed&quot; by an incoming wire transfer before.<p>At first, I used an online banking tool where I copy&pasted all incoming wire transfers into my web application, which would regex for all ordernumbers, do a little plausibility check (incoming amount equals the amount that was set when the order was generated; user has open orders) and set the order to &quot;processed&quot; and extend the account by the according amount of months.<p>Now, I use a VPS where I installed an HBCI client (AqBanking). It&#x27;s relatively easy to set up and once a day, it fetches all new wire transfers via cronjob and sends them via cURL to my web app where the same regex and plausibility check happens that I used before.<p>It feels a bit weird to store your banking PIN on a VPS, so make sure the VPS is properly secured.<p>The VPS sends me an email whether or not everything worked and that&#x27;s it.<p>Most days of the week, there&#x27;s no problem. Sometimes, you get the wrong amount from people, some people don&#x27;t put the order number, some people confuse the bank number (BLZ) with the order number and so on.

As a result, they&#x27;re used much more often in research centered around having cancer than getting cancer.

So, there&#x27;s the possibility that one or more of the groups through chance just had particularly gluttonous rats.

He had to stay in the hospital quite a while, and got restless because he couldn&#x27;t hack. Two of his friends therefore took a terminal and a modem for it to the hospital, so that he could use the computer by telephone from his hospital bed.<p>Now this happened some years before the spread of home computers, and computer terminals were not a familiar sight to the average person. When the two friends got to the hospital, a guard stopped them and asked what they were carrying. They explained that they wanted to take a computer terminal to their friend who was a patient.<p>The guard got out his list of things that patients were permitted to have in their rooms: TV, radio, electric razor, typewriter, tape player, ... no computer terminals. Computer terminals weren&#x27;t on the list, so the guard wouldn&#x27;t let it in. Rules are rules, you know. (This guard was clearly a droid.)<p>Fair enough, said the two friends, and they left again. They were frustrated, of course, because they knew that the terminal was as harmless as a TV or anything else on the list... which gave them an idea.<p>The next day they returned, and the same thing happened: a guard stopped them and asked what they were carrying. They said: &quot;This is a TV typewriter!&quot; The guard was skeptical, so they plugged it in and demonstrated it. &quot;See? You just type on the keyboard and what you type shows up on the TV screen.&quot; Now the guard didn&#x27;t stop to think about how utterly useless a typewriter would be that didn&#x27;t produce any paper copies of what you typed; but this was clearly a TV typewriter, no doubt about it. So he checked his list: &quot;A TV is all right, a typewriter is all right ... okay, take it on in!&quot;<p>[Historical note: Many years ago, &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; published solder-it-yourself plans for a TV typewriter. Despite the essential uselessness of the device, it was an enormously popular project. Steve Ciarcia, the man behind &quot;Byte&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Circuit Cellar&quot; feature, resurrected this ghost in one of his books of the early 1980s. He ascribed its popularity (no doubt correctly) to the feeling of power the builder could achieve by being able to decide himself what would be shown on the TV. --ESR]<p>[Antihistorical note: On September 23rd, 1992, the L.A.

It&#x27;s the fact that you&#x27;re accepting content from people you don&#x27;t know or trust and publishing it.<p>- Can people leave comments anonymously?  Few blogs think this is a good idea anymore.  So now you need a user identity system.<p>- Does that mean you&#x27;re going to have your own user management just for leaving blog comments?  Probably not.  You don&#x27;t want to have to manage password reset emails, for example. Letting someone else manage that is more sane.  Someone like Facebook/Twitter/Google/Yahoo.<p>- So do you write integration with all of them yourself?  Bleh.<p>- Then someone leaves a comment.  Is it spam?  You need integration with Akismet or a similarly powerful engine to help stem that tide.  Doing it entirely manually is a huge time sink.<p>- But not all bad comments are spam.  Some of them are ascii-art genitals.  Sometimes people just use your comment thread as a soapbox for their personal crusades or get into pissing matches with each other.  If you have many comments at all, you need a moderation system to prevent them from creating a hostile atmosphere that drives nice people away.<p>- You have to ensure that people can&#x27;t use your comment form to inject a XSS attack onto your page, or exploit some security bug in your web framework to take control of your server.<p>So people save some sanity by just using a 3rd party blogging service entirely (Blogger, Tumblr, Wordpress.com), or embedding Disqus, or putting a link at the bottom of the post saying &quot;Discuss on Hacker News&quot;.<p>Edit: added the &quot;like social networks&quot; example in the second bullet that was in my head but didn&#x27;t get into the text.",1385744626

8082536,comment,8080442,8081983,5,0,tedsanders,,,"Two thoughts in response to your thoughts:<p>1. Sure, it&#x27;s possible the phone company didn&#x27;t &quot;deserve&quot; the money (perhaps, as you say, the phone failed to make calls). But it&#x27;s just as possible the phone company did &quot;deserve&quot; the money (and that the phone made calls but refunded the change). There&#x27;s no way to know what happened for certain. However, what is certain is that the kid did not earn or &quot;deserve&quot; the money.<p>It also becomes quite dangerous to reason based on who &quot;deserves&quot; something. Am I entitled to rob any person who has not lived a moral life by my standards of morality? (No.) :)<p>2. I think this is hyperbole and a total strawman. Mailing $6 to a phone company will not result in a lawsuit. Do you actually think this would happen? I worry that attitudes like this come from the selection bias in the media, where rare outrageous stories are reported far more often than commonplace stories, resulting in shifted perceptions of reality. If you would care to bet or fund me, I would be happy to send $6 to a phone company. I highly doubt that criminal charges would be filed against me.<p>Your thoughts seem to be trying to rationalize taking money that isn&#x27;t yours. I think this is precisely the attitude that his grandfather was hoping to avoid instilling in his grandchild.<p>(P.S. I mean no offense or snobbery, in case any came across.)",1406239090

Excess cash in a business that can not be explained should be <i>just</i> as worrisome as having too little. The latter is an indication that someone is raiding the till in some creative way, the former that you are not paying someone that you should be paying, which can lead to the sudden demise of your business if the creditor has a long enough arm.<p>No matter how small your business you should at least have a general ledger and a liquidity forecast running 6 months to a year into the future.",1406239027

This quote is especially exciting, since scalability is the main question I&#x27;ve had about quantum computing (and really quantum mechanics as a whole) being viable outside of a lab.<p>>“The problem of coherence is a major focus of our research here,” Lee said. “Every researcher connected to this field dreams of building a quantum computer. We are not trying to build a quantum computer. Our belief is that trying to build a quantum machine by controlling electron spin and using surface codes is like trying to build a computer using vacuum tubes. Labs all over the world can do that, but you’ll never be able to scale up. We’re taking an outrageously hard, unreasonably difficult approach, and if we succeed – and it’s a big if – then we will have a building block for a scalable quantum machine.

I bet if you examine the history of your own utterances for the past several years. you&#x27;d find that you do, too.<p>There are obviously different scales of truth-telling and deception. &quot;It&#x27;s your baby.&quot; is a lot different than, &quot;Ah - I can&#x27;t make it. I&#x27;m just too tired!&quot; But it&#x27;s still lying. In fact human lying is so frequent that a lot of the smaller lies we tell to be polite or avoid hurting feelings barely even register as lies, even though that&#x27;s what they are, plain and simple. Clearly Kant&#x27;s maxim that lying is permissible under no circumstances is false.<p>In business lying is rampant. You are competing with liars. Marketing is institutionalized lying. People are constantly embellishing the features of their product so that it purports to do something magical when on closer inspection most features are much more mundane. Sales is even more about convincing the person you&#x27;re talking to that they can&#x27;t live without something they probably can live without.

Why is it that this makes executions more expensive than life in prison?  Do people sentenced to life have fewer appeals?  If so, why?  Do they simply choose to appeal less, or are they not afforded as many opportunities to appeal?  Unless they are actually guilty, either possibility is problematic.  In the first case, that means that innocent people sentenced to life are giving up on justice.  In the second case, that means that innocent people sentenced to life are being denied justice.<p>One of the other common criticisms of executions are that they are final; finding out that somebody was innocent after killing them is useless to that person.

Things go wrong in engineering, and there are unexpected snags and slowdowns, and a well-managed business should be able to absorb them without losing customers.

The overhead cost of advertising is huge and we pay for that too. Ad systems and data collection systems, ad engineers and people like the author. Ad agencies. Creative agencies. Ad tracking. Marketing departments.<p>3. As the article points out, we pay the opportunity cost of a product that cannot put users first because they live or die by giving advertisers what they want. Costs include our lost privacy, content and services design that optimize for advertising revenue instead of its users, and our time and attention stolen by surreptitious ads. As has been said, we are more Google&#x27;s products than we are their customers.<p>4. We pay the social costs.

Yet Gosu&#x27;s syntax is very close to Java&#x27;s, keeping the learning curve comparatively low.  Basically, if you&#x27;re proficient in Java, you&#x27;ll have no trouble moving over to Gosu and, in contrast with say Scala, you&#x27;ll also have no trouble reading other people&#x27;s Gosu.  But unlike Java, Gosu is designed to be both an embedded scripting language and a general purpose programming language.<p>As an enterprise software company Guidewire needed a statically typed scripting language directly compatible with the JVM, one a Java programmer could easily pick up, and one that could blend powerful features like type inference, closures, enhancements, properties, open types, structural and dynamic types, built-in templating, etc.  Guidewire also wanted to directly and seamlessly use the power and flexibility of the scripting language directly in application source code.  Why distinguish between a scripting language and a general purpose language?  Why force your customers to juggle two separate languages?  12 years later it&#x27;s still difficult to argue against Gosu.  Sure, Java 8 is catching up in some core feature areas, and that&#x27;s great news for JVM languages, but Java as a language is still not appropriate or even usable as an embedded scripting language, nor is it suitable for many of the other use-cases a very large scale web application requires.<p>Can Java 8 dynamically compile and load classes from source at runtime?

So it often comes down to how you combine the results from the different test images. Do you take the max?

A bank just needs to get the Bitcoin address of the receiving bank in a reliable manner (ie. instead of IBAN/BIC) and then the transaction can be made and verified. The regulations are still important, because they hold each end accountable (so if Bob&#x27;s bank can prove that they sent the money to Alice&#x27;s bank, which they can, then the regulations make sure Alice gets her money) but right now there are a whole lot of unnecessary regulations for the middle part (steps 2-4 on the Wikipedia page). More importantly, using Bitcoin greatly reduces the number of <i>international</i> regulations and agreements that are required, and those are probably the fattest of all.<p>So yeah, I would love to see Bitcoin replacing SWIFT/Fedwire etc, but I doubt it will ever replace banks (although it might make it easier for smaller banks to compete).

These people wait until the last second to merge instead of finding an opening while traffic is flowing and force traffic to slow down in order to let them in.<p>And the really real problem is that the average driver in the USA has no idea what they are doing and should probably not be driving at all.  It would take a huge change in the way we train drivers to get them to recognize when they should use each type of merge.  And forcing people into one way to merge or the other is not really the &quot;fastest/safest&quot; way, because it varies on conditions.",1406235617

It&#x27;s an example of the sort of wantonly confrontational language that seems to flow naturally from many people when alone behind a keyboard.<p>But the substance of it – suggesting that some apologies are perhaps somewhat orthogonal to the wrongs admitted, or that there may be a lack of thoughts expressed for those let down by the mistakes – isn&#x27;t unworthy of consideration.<p>It&#x27;s just a shame these had to be written from a perspective of confrontation rather than of compassion.",1406235602

Let me explore (my gut may be wrong here)...<p>I agree that it's important for freelance engineers and designers to have some business help. Being a good ""creator"" doesn't necessarily mean you're good at negotiations, and while its an important skill, there is something nice about being able to focus on doing the work (and doing a good job) vs having to find the clients, negotiate the deals, handle payment, etc. That can be an unwelcome distraction for some people who aren't naturally good at it.<p>But that's why design/development studios exist. Even in a small shop - there's a guy who specs the project, a guy who negotiates the deal, a designer, and a developer (yes, there's often overlap in those roles). You pay a premium for the full-service of those distinct roles.<p>I think what's bothering me here is that these guys are perpetuating the notion that, literally, hiring a ""celebrity""/""rock star"" engineer/designer (""10xer"") is something that folks should be paying a huge premium for. And that if you are that rock star, that you're so awesome that you need talent management (who deserves 15%). The premium here isn't for a support staff to help manage the project - the premium here is to get that celebrity development talent.<p>Not saying this is necessarily a bad thing - maybe it's an innovation that's much needed in the industry. But my gut is that they're spreading the celebrity-worship mentality of the entertainment industry to the software industry, and I'm not confident that's the right move.<p>It works in the entertainment industry because the link is much clearer -- you put Vinny Chase in your movie, it's going to do better than if you put in a no-name actor (all else being equal). Does that same thing work in the software industry?<p>Thoughts?",1363705199

It started out as free for everyone, since I just built it for myself and people found it useful, but I quickly had to charge, after realizing that people had more than my 10-20 bookmarks (some people had 80 THOUSAND).<p>I changed it to 2,000 free bookmarks, and unlimited paid, which worked well. Then I changed it to 300 free, then to 50 free. The reason why I did this is this:<p>As per my analytics package, on average, it takes <i>less than two</i> minutes for 95% of my users to upgrade to paid. Basically, from what I can see, users register, try it out with one or two bookmarks, then upgrade immediately if they like it. If they don't upgrade then, they are not very likely to ever upgrade.<p>Thus, it doesn't make sense for me to support free users (this is very expensive, since it stores the entire page for everything you bookmark, twice), so the free tier is more of a ""trial"" tier now.<p>I'm not sure how many people who would have upgraded if they'd tried it saw the limit and said ""I won't use this, the free limit is too low"", but, based on the data (and it sounds reasonable to me as well), they are not many. People reasonably want a short trial run, and then they either upgrade or don't.",1363705078

5401225,comment,5400055,5400055,5,0,fecak,,,"I laid out something similar here on HN last summer and Atlay (of 10x) was one of the first to comment. (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4555165"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4555165</a>)  As a longtime tech recruiter, what I find most valuable about the model is that it is much more geared towards helping tech pros focus on what they do best (code) and not have to worry about what they tend to do worst (handle the business side of their work, negotiate, etc.).  I haven't switched my business into an agency model at this point as I think there are still a few kinks to be worked out.<p>Here is some recruiter-speak (what we are trained to say) that might make sense to some of the contractors out there or at least sound familiar.  If you are working with a recruiter and you ask for $125/hr, and you feel that is a very fair market rate for the work you will be doing, and the recruiter is able to get the client to pay say $130/hr, chances are you won't care because you are getting your 125 and the recruiter is making almost nothing.  So let's now say that the recruiter is an excellent negotiator and gets $150 - should you (as the coder) get more because the recruiter was able to negotiate a higher rate?  At what point should the recruiter be rewarded for doing a good job negotiating?  If the recruiter is getting $250 total and you are only at $125, surely you will feel slighted - but if $125 is the market rate for that skill, should the recruiter not be rewarded for the ability to negotiate and get a higher rate?  I could argue both sides of this.<p>One way to alleviate part of this problem is to essentially split the difference.  If you come to me asking for 125, let's say my standard cut is 10% (which is low, but this is just an example) - and anything I get above that 10% we split.  So at 137.5, you are at 125 and I'm at 12.5 (10%). If I get the client up to 150, I get my 12.50 (10% of your 125) + 1/2 of the additional 12.50 (150-137.5) for a total of 18.75, while you get 131.25.  This way the recruiter is rewarded for getting a higher rate, and the coder doesn't feel like a victim.<p>Unfortunately, most recruiters won't reveal the bill rate (paid by the company) to the coder or the coder's rate to the company, so all sides are in the dark except the middleman.<p>Almost all recruiting models are quite imperfect and have some really disturbing incentives for the recruiters (<a href=""http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2012/09/17/disrupt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2012/09/17/disrupt/</a>).  Transparency between all parties is something I am offering my candidates so they can use their best judgment as to whether my advice is clouded by a higher fee with one company over another.  Transparency is the real key to solving many of the problems in the industry.<p>The agent model seems to be the right track, and hopefully we'll get it right some day.",1363704906

JSTORs response was similar to MITs. We believe the information we provided to the United States Attorneys Office in this case should be made open and available to the public. In a letter dated Feb. 25, we agreed to the lifting of the protective order so long as the articles downloaded from JSTOR were not released and the identities of our staff are protected, said Heidi McGregor, a JSTOR spokeswoman, in an email to The Tech. We do not agree that individuals names need to be included with these materials to serve the public interest.
""<p>""
Although the United States and representatives of Mr. Swartz agreed on many proposed modifications to the order, the United States and Mr. Swartzs representatives did not reach agreement on the scope of the redactions, Pirozzolo said.<p>The United States expects to respond to the motion within the time provided by the district court rules, he said. It will also request that individuals potentially affected by the modification of the order be given an opportunity to be heard on the proposed modifications.

I think that's an interesting story regardless of whether or not it influences what you choose to eat.<p>That's all well and good as long as you give the full story, but you've forsaken the anti-grain diet fads while parroting their mantra almost verbatim. Namely, the idea that grains are a primary food source <i>only because they're an easy source of calories</i>. What about the fact that they're also rich in essential nutrients and have numerous documented health benefits?<p>When you say this:<p>> fruits and vegetables are generally healthier to eat than grains.<p>And then follow it up with this:<p>> Around 12,000 years ago, a group of Neolithic humans conducted an experiment that forever changed the course of human development. They left behind the way they had eaten for countless generations and moved to a diet that helped them face new problems and evolve in new ways. I believe its possible for this generation to do the same.<p>It's clear you're trying to persuade people to eat fewer grains. Don't get me wrong, I love to re-examine common knowledge we all take for granted as much as anyone, but there are good, scientific reasons people say ""eat lots of whole grains"" and it seems very odd to condemn them without taking those reasons into account.",1363703832

At least someone else than Schneier realizes Unicode is a major PITA from a correctness and security point of view.  Schneier said it best: <i>""Unicode is too complex to ever be secure""</i>.<p>Back to floats.  It's nearly always a mistake to be using floats unless you're working on scientific computation (and 3D and game physics a are a kind of scientific computation).<p>If you don't know how to compute error propagation: floats aren't for you.  There.  As simple as that.<p>It's interesting to realize that most comments here do not adress that fundamental issue: it's not a particular bug in fp that's the problem.  It's the overuse of fp itself that is the problem.<p>I can give you one the simple example of a f^cktarded use of floats: in a gigantic spec (HTML) someone decided there would be a probability expressed as a number between 0 and 1 with up to three decimal points.  This is totally f^cktarded and lots of people complained that it was a retarded thing to do.  You should express this as a number between 0 and 999.  Why?  Because you know that otherwise clueless programmers are going to make mistakes while using floating point numbers where they shouldn't.<p>And surely some programmers did.  Some clueless monkeys in the Tomcat codebases decided it was a good idea to parse a number which was know to have at most three digits after the dot using... Java's built-in floating point parsing number library.  That's silly of course: when a f^cktarded spec talks about a number between 0.000 and 0.999 you parse it manually into integers and do integers maths but I digress.<p>So what did happen?  Some people realized they could throw Java's floating-point parsing number library into an infinite loop and that's it: the most deadly Java remote DoS exploit to attack website.  By faking one browser request you could throw one thread on a webapp server in an infinite loop.  Rinse and repeat and a single machine could DoS an entire server farm.<p>Due to <i>stupid</i> programmers using floating-point numbers when they shouldn't.<p>The problem is exacerbated by clueless people everywhere thinking floating-point numbers are a good idea.  They're not.  They should die a horrible days and the days where CPU didn't have floating-point numbers were arguably better days for 99.999% of what should our use.<p>Thankfully there's one area were even f^cktarded monkeys aren't using floating-point numbers: cryptography.<p>I'd say that unless you can <i>write</i> Goldberg's <i>""What every computer scientist should know about floating-point numbers""</i> then you shouldn't be using floating-point numbers.

I had always wanted a way to get more value for my games but wasn't sure how much demand there was for something like this. I had recently finished reading The Lean Startup, which talks of creating a Minimum Viable Product to get your idea out there as quick as possible. I thought this approach would work well for me so I set out to do that. I quickly threw together a bare minimum site where you could only sign up with Facebook and add the games titles that you would be willing to trade. You couldn't actually trade or really do anything at all, but I knew this would be enough to let me know if this idea was worth pursuing.<p>I was thinking maybe a few hundred people would see it and I'd be able to get some feedback on the idea, but within a few hours the post was at the top of r/gaming and managed to reach the front page for a while.<p>Since then the site has been launched and has recently came out of beta. We have over 2000 trades completed and 5000 games from 25 platforms.<p>If anyone has a minute to spare I'd love to hear your feedback.",1363703781

They are probably legit.<p>- People tell you that making money online is easy, say that you can make thousands of dollars working only few hours a day, and try to sell you their very expensive products with the magic formulas for making money online? RUN AWAY AND NEVER LOOK BACK. THEY'RE SCAMMERS.<p>The truth is that you can learn most things that you need for free.<p>I'm all for investing in yourself, and it's true that premium products by legitimate experts can help you achieve the results much faster, but my advice is not to buy anything in this niche until you have a good understanding who those legitimate experts are.<p>I get why are you so suspicious, though: online marketing world is full of BS.",1363703389

In an era where we're over-consuming calories it makes sense to start cutting the most calorie-dense (and also least filling) foods first.<p>As someone who went to Fat Class when he was a kid, this has been accepted practice for dietitians for years. If you're over-consuming, you want to optimize for a balance of the amount of calories reduced vs. the amount of hunger increased. Leaving oneself hungry is the surest way to fall of a diet-change wagon - and cheap sugars give the ""worst"" combination of fillingness vs. calories consumed (it would be best if we actually needed said calories).<p>The argument doesn't stem from some pseudoscientific belief that some foods are magically worse than others for inscrutable reasons like inverting the polaron field. It makes its argument from the (typically anti-paleo) stance that all foods are (more or less equal) and calories are the primary concern.",1363703278

Phytic acid binds with important minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc, making them unavailable when digested. Cows, sheep, goats, and other non-humans produce various phytases, enzymes that digest phytic acid, but humans don't. Some people (such as Marlene Zuk, author of Paleofantasy, recently linked on HN) say that 10,000 years is enough to adapt to a new food, and cite lactose tolerance as an example. But lactose tolerance is the result of a single SNP, which can occur in at least two places. To digest phytic acid, humans would need to evolve a whole new enzyme. You need more than 10,000 years for that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytic_acid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytic_acid</a>",1363702946

Since states in the northeast are generally smaller (i.e. less populous) than, say, California, we can assume that there are also fewer people getting infected there.<p>E.g., there are approx. 1e6 people in Maine and 4e7 people in California. If you assume 1e2 infected hosts in Maine (0-99) and 3e4 in California (>1e4, 1.2e5 in total), you get an infection rate in California of about 7.5 that in Maine.<p>Given the very coarse graining in the data source, such a factor can either be dismissed as statistical fluctuation or you could try to explain it using, for example, an infection model that favours geographical proximity, such as one based on Facebook friends. Furthermore, it might well be that internet connectivity is better in California than it is in Maine and the bot prefers hosts with high uplink rates.

The challenge is finding pure water when you're in an environment surrounded by salt water. Tap water, for example, contains a lot of chlorine, which is caustic as well. Well water contains dissolved solids that will leave mineral deposits. Ideally, you'd want to flush it very, very well with distilled water, which is hard to come by in most situations involving salt water.<p>Also, I'm not thrilled about the way this article presents information. There are a lot of details missing, and some key information omitted. Take this statement, for example:<p>> The inner tube of the lens was rusted and was not moving because of the salt water damage. That's why they decided to boil some of the parts. In fact, the staff said that they had to add some chemicals into the boiling water in order to remove the rust.<p>Boy is this a land-mine of epic proportions. Rust (ferric oxide) is hard stuff. Boiling a rusty piece of metal in the wrong solution (like plain water) will just make the rust harder! You need some reagent that will soften the rust, but not damage the base metal too much.

It obviously depends on what you're doing, who wrote the abstraction and how much is being abstracted.<p>> First: ignore pretty much anything Facebook has to say about DOM performance. They really have no idea what they are talking about. Sencha was able to make a version of the Facebook mobile app with their framework, and it was FASTER than the official, native app, and Sencha isnt even particularly fast.<p>If you create an app that has half the feature set of another app it will likely be easier to make it go fast.<p>> Second: Stop using DOM libraries out of habit! If your target browser is IE8 or above, jQuery hardly provides any features that arent shipped on the host object anyway. document.querySelectorAll will pretty much do everything you need. jQuery is a tool, not a framework. Use it as such.<p>jQuery provides a clean sensible API.

SQLite4 splits the SQL engine from the storage engine and provides public APIs for both, including the ability to run the SQL engine on top of any key/value store that provides an ordered-map interface.<p>In the new design a row's primary key directly contributes to its physical key, meaning lookups and iterations on the primary key involve only one scan (rather than an index scan followed by random lookups in SQLite 3.x/most DBMS). Basically the old ""OID"" feature on steroids, except now you don't have to design for it at all. This also means data is inherently clustered by primary key, providing further performance benefits.<p>The new storage engine in 4.x is exciting by itself, it's a log structured merge tree, similar to LevelDB but using the old SQLite 3.x B+tree instead of SSTables for the disk segments. Additionally it is possible to incrementally compact older generations inline as part of each write, rather than mandatorily having some unpredictable background compactor thread like LevelDB. Similar to 3.x and unlike LevelDB, the storage engine also supports interprocess locking, meaning it's trivial to write software with concurrent readers across multiple processes and a single writer.<p>The possibility of mixing a key/value store and SQL store, including having single transactions affecting both stores, is really exciting.

However, I'd like to have a few things clarified. I'm not worried about IP anymore, or RIAA influence on this, but I am concerned with privacy implications. You seem to claim the definition of ""information"" is narrow, but I would disagree given the language in the bill:<p>> or any information stored on, processed on, or transiting such a system or network<p>This would imply the following:
a) Any system that is ""attacked"" (under the slightly broad definition provided) may share ALL of its data. This means everything I've done on that website, including both logs and content. Given that an entity like Facebook is ""attacked"" multiple times per day, now the government can obtain all of my data without a warrant.
b) Any network that has been ""attacked"" (under broad definition) may be wiretapped without a warrant and all information transmitted to the government.<p>What language in the bill will reasonably limit these two scenarios? Given the progress of our government in reducing individual liberty over the past 12 years, can you not see potential danger in the existing language? My warning bells are going off, because it seems like an underhanded way to strengthen provisions that allow my ""secure papers"" to be obtained without warrant.",1363701879

The poor <i>have</i> to spend their limited means in such a currency - they <i>have</i> to spend substantial fractions of their working capital on consumables.<p>Conversely, the rich don't. In fact, above a key level depending on how quickly it gains value, the rich functionally never lose any money - they can hold such levels of it that the amount they spend on food is rapidly eclipsed by the increase in value in their wealth.<p>Of course, this sounds good and is somewhat true with normal currency via investment but there's the rub: with a deflationary currency you don't have to invest. You don't have to put your money in the bank, or loan it out or indeed engage in any type of productive activity to get wealthier. The poor are doomed to work all their lives because they can't get above the magic level of wealth where they don't have to, meanwhile those with the piles of wealth dispense tiny fractions to them to buy necessities.

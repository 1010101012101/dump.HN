This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding unnecessary snark or negativity; being charitable towards people I disagree with; and not mouthing off about things I don&#x27;t understand.<p>I&#x27;d love to know whether I&#x27;m achieving this, and you can let me know with the above feedback form.

Briefly, this means that you don&#x27;t need to sugar-coat what you have to say, you can just be blunt if that makes it easier for you to say it.

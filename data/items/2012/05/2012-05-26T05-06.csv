4026632,comment,4025588,4025829,3,0,stiff,,,"If you look at other articles at CodingHorror, I don't think Jeff Atwood associates coding with things like ""algorithmic thinking"" (which is not necessarily bad, he just has a different focus), but do courses of ""learning to code"" teach it all that much? For beginners learning to code is more about just learning to ""make the computer do"" simple things via learning all the terminology, syntax, the deciphering of compiler error messages etc. It takes plenty more effort to learn some theory along the way and this is most likely to happen in an academic setting and the popular courses are really more about craftsmanship.<p>Robert Sedgewick has a nice ""Introduction to programming"" course followed by an ""Introduction to CS"":<p><a href=""http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/cs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/cs/</a><p>It sure could be useful to a wide audience, especially for people in science. For people in general? I think not more than hundreds of other skills. People in every discipline tend to think what they do is the pinnacle of all understanding, this is especially visible in academia and in schools, but in the end you cannot know every thing that <i>potentially</i> could be useful.

4026625,comment,4026360,4026360,4,0,shaggyfrog,,,"Not only is being able to get to the raw data not micromanaging, it's good management.<p>Richard Feynman spoke about how he stopped trusting values simply because they came from some authoritative source after getting burned once. After that he calculated things himself.<p>That lesson relates to the ""global telecommunications giant"" in the story, whose ""critical network software upgrade"" was turning into a disaster. In fact, I recently went through a similar situation myself at a job; well before I got there, technical leadership had planned out an overly-ambitious, complex and time-consuming whole-scale rewrite of a critical service, and when I arrived, they were chest-deep in shit creek. As the team sunk lower and lower, I felt compelled to reach out to higher-ups. That's how I lost my head. I hear their collective hair is still on fire.<p>Is the lesson there that I should have kept more quiet? I'm still not sure. But what is clear to me is that non-technical leadership need to be able to properly assess the risks of technical decisions. As the story mentions, one of the best ways to do that is to get someone from outside the team to analyze the process and the progress. Because even someone half-competent will be able to tell you when some major upgrade creates a major risk, and the best way to mitigate that risk is to divide-and-conquer the major task into minor ones.<p>Another key smell is how ""the program managers' key performance indicator dashboards showed nothing alarmingly unusual"". I would dare say that those dashboards are then fundamentally broken. One fix: edw519 has written about the need for task progress to either be 100% or 0%, as a way to flush issues out of the woodwork.<p>Fred Brooks is right: we're still stuck in the tar-pits.

What you seem to claiming is basically that a currency is defined by both its inherent features <i>and</i> its supporting ecosystem.<p>So in BTC's case, inherent features = protocol, client, and miners.  Supporting ecosystem = buyers, sellers, savers, merchants, exchanges, investors, speculators, banks, escrow, etc.<p>Further, you seem to assert, failure of parts of the supporting ecosystem causes BTC to lose value (true), and that losing value means the currency is failing (not necessarily, stochastic variables fluctuate, hard to tell the signal from the noise).<p>The value of a currency is fundametally a function of its demand relative to its supply (as with pretty much everything in this world).  Demand for currencies increase with their utility.<p>For example, is it the only currency in the world you can buy oil with?  If yes, utility increases -> demand increases -> value increases (ceteris paribus, no increase in supply).<p>In that regard, Bitcoin appears to have a strong baseline of utility in that its core technologies are relatively sound.  Truthfully it's probably too soon to make that call, given potential problems with mining pool consolidation, pseudo-anonymity, etc.<p>But Bitcoin's core technology is so far sound enough  to provide a consistent utility/demand/value/price baseline relative to the shaky, hobbyist/amateur supporting ecosystem that has sprung up around it.<p>So that when even its biggest exchange MtGox.com is hacked, or one of its most high-profile financial companies Bitcoinica.com is hacked and bankrupted, the BTC price in dollars continues to revert to a mean of around $5-$6, aka the BTC Baseline.<p>So, asserting that failures of BTC's peripheral components represent failure of the currency itself, or that BTC is not a currency because its supporting ecosystem (which the BTC devs have almost no control over) is weak, is a bit of hyperbole, and the reason for all the pushback.<p>Also, keep in mind that Rome wasn't built in a day.  Building a new currency of any sort is difficult (ask Europe), and building one that's made of electricity and algorithms instead of gold or sovereign debt is probably one of the most difficult things in the world, and BTC is the first viable one humanity has ever seen.<p>Getting the core technologies right is crucial, and the BTC team has done a great job for their first try, but have another few decades of continuous improvement before it will be considered truly sound.<p>Asserting at this point that it has failed or succeeded is probably a bit premature.  The jury will be out for a while yet.  Speculate at your own risk.",1338009585

Luckily my business degree had a couple VB classes, so I'm not starting with zero.<p>What I'm doing:<p>1. Codecademy will teach you the basic concepts of programming. Codecademy expands into HTML, Javascript, CSS, and other technologies that can be used to make websites and mobile apps. (You can stick a website inside a wrapper and call it an app.)<p>2. If you like Windows, get the Visual Studio 11 beta while it's free and start making a windows form in VB or C#. If you don't, either install Cygwin or a distro and learn about the tools for Linux. (sorry I'm not more help here)<p>3. Find projects to do - find a small problem at work that you can solve. I made a program that makes an email template , so filling out an internal form is just a couple clicks. Also check out coding challenges.<p>4. Look for software internships, open source projects, and other places where you can build your burgeoning skills while gaining experience in working with large projects.<p>I don't know if I'm going about this the right way either, and I've been thinking about making this same Ask HN post too.",1338009057

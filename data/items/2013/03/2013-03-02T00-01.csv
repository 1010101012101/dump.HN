5307944,comment,5304873,5307630,1,0,PeterisP,,,"Compilers can work around that choice - if you want to do something with immutable strings (like the Haskell example I mentioned, it does have immutable strings) then you will have to make some copy, but you don't need to make a copy per every function - if you're stringing three string functions in a row, the compiler can ""fuse"" the processing so that only a single, final copy is made, not the intermediate ones.<p>For any language the compiler may know which variables won't ever be used - for example in pseudocode<p><pre><code>  b = a.lowercase()
  c = b.replace(""x"",""y"")
  d = a.lowercase.replace(""x"",""y"")
</code></pre>
both 'b' and the intermediate result in 'd' are strings, but the compiler can flag these two 'throw-away' variables as mutable strings (while still maintaining the promise that all programmer-visible strings will be immutable); and you may have a special version of 'replace' standard function that does no-copy, in-place replacement in such cases. It means extra work in building API/stdlib, but brings better performance for the same programs.",1362185980

I'm not actually deaf!!"" and walked out without buying anything.<p>I felt stupid and annoyed that he had wasted so much of our time.

It was usual that some random scenes would be adjudicated unacceptable and cut from the show. When discussion started the communist rep asked what the wheel, which was used in agriculture, was doing in a show about factory workers. The director argued that it shows the connection between proletariat and agriculture workers. A vigorous discussion followed at the end of which it was decided that the wheel should be removed. The director ended up being the first ever to not have any scene cut.<p>- A painter visited France and desperately wanted to bring back some modern art reproductions so that his colleagues, who where not allowed to leave the country, would get a chance to see them.

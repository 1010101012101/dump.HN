8358853,comment,8355941,8358418,1,0,nerfhammer,,,"> I might underestimate the power of the almighty buck here, but I&#x27;d take the employer that says &quot;we value work/life balance, when we say 40h/week we mean it literally, we allow remote work, and we have 5 paid weeks off&quot;.<p>Almost universally what you see in job ads and recruiter spam is &quot;we offer <i>exciting challenges</i>&quot; and that they&#x27;ve created the most fun place to work ever and if they mention compensation at all they offer &quot;market salary&quot; or &quot;salary commensurate with experience&quot;, to the point where all these different messages sound pretty much the same.<p>I get hundreds of messages on linkedin and they all sound like the above with exciting challenges with a market salary, but I don&#x27;t recall anyone attempting to promise above-market salary or better vacation time, even once. You would think that you could get a competitive advantage by promising tangible benefits as you suggest, but I&#x27;ve never seen it.<p>Some do mention being more flexible with remote work though.<p>> so it&#x27;s basically a job that requires one parent to stay at home at least part time?<p>Yes, basically.<p>> Or you need a nanny to pick up your kids after school/kindergarten?<p>In the US children are universally bussed to/from school, you don&#x27;t need to come pick them up yourself. So once they&#x27;re old enough that they don&#x27;t need constant supervision they often have a couple hours to themselves at home.<p>> My guess is that you are going to say that normally one parent (and not a random one) just stays home for years after having kids, but that would be a real blow to my view of SF/NYC as progressive...<p>In terms of labor conditions? CA and NY have a handful of better labor protections than the rest of the country, but progressive by your standards? absolutely not.<p>> It seems odd to me that people making a lot of money (which I hope these salaries are considered), wouldn&#x27;t just invest a huge chunk of it in family/free time, by simply working less hours, e.g. 75% at 75% pay.<p>That would be great. I would totally do that.<p>Remember, people don&#x27;t get paid by the hour so there&#x27;s no counterincentive to employers using social pressure to get you to put in as much time as possible. There is no concept of a set number of hours you&#x27;re supposed to work.<p>> Also I&#x27;m surprised of how employers (candidates, rather) aren&#x27;t pushing the compensation in a more work/life balance friendly direction.<p>Yes. People are not willing to fight for this.<p>> Especially since these were visa applications, a lot of which I assume come from people used to 5w holidays and actual 40h workweeks.<p>The bulk of these these are from Asia or India where the salary differential might be very large.",1411513127

Add garlic and cook 1 minute more. Stir in flour and stir constantly until golden brown. Add tomatoes and brown. Blend in stock and simmer 10 minutes. Add salt, pepper, cayenne, Worcestershire sauce and crawfish, cook slowly 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve with hot rice\n\n    From: http://www.brennansneworleans.com/r_crawfishEtouffee.html\n\n    -- 2013/02/24\n\n    Absolutely delicious. Possibly the best étouffée I&#x27;ve had. The roux seemed thin\n    so I added another 2-3 tbsp. It ended up thickening a bit over time, but the end\n    result was about right I think.\n\n    There was a bit of oil on top and it was pretty heavy, so I&#x27;d reduce the butter\n    a bit. Maybe by 2 tbps. (Updated recipe above.)\n\n    Used medium-grain rice because I wanted something pretty sticky. I liked it, but\n    Megan thought it was a but too gluey.\n\n    -- 2013/03/24\n\n    Used 6 tbsp of butter this time and 4 tbsp of flour (updated recipe above) and\n    it came out great. Possibly a bit too salty, but otherwise excellent texture and\n    taste. Got rave reviews.\n\n    -- 2014/02/18\n\n    Came out great, except the roux was a bit lumpy. I sort of dumped the flour in\n    all at once and ended up with some little balls of flour. Make sure to add it\n    in slowly and stir vigorously at first.\n</code></pre>\nPotato and Leeks au Gratin<p><pre><code>    ingredients:\n\n    8 cups sliced peeled potatoes (1/4-inch slices)\n    3 medium leeks (white portion only), cut into 1/2-inch slices\n    2 tablespoons butter\n    3 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n    1/2 teaspoon salt\n    1/8 teaspoon pepper\n    1-1/3 cups 2% milk\n    1 block (4 ounces) Gruyere or Swiss cheese, shredded\n    1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n\n    crumb topping:\n    - 1/3 cup dry bread crumbs\n    - 2 tablespoons butter, melted\n    - 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese\n\n    directions:\n    - Place potatoes in a Dutch oven and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Add\n      leeks; return to a boil. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Drain and pat dry.\n      Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. baking dish.\n    - In a large saucepan, melt butter. Stir in the flour, salt and pepper until\n      smooth; gradually add milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or\n      until thickened. Stir in cheese and nutmeg until cheese is melted. Pour over\n      potato mixture. Toss bread crumbs and butter; sprinkle over the top.\n    - Bake uncovered at 350° for 20 minutes. Sprinkle with cheddar cheese. Bake\n      another 20 minutes or so until the cheese is golden.\n\n      Yield: 12 servings.\n\n    -- 2012-09-28\n\n    Didn&#x27;t have a Dutch oven, so just boiled the vegetables in a pot. I boiled them\n    too vigorously, and by five minutes they were soft enough that the potatoes\n    were falling apart a bit. I didn&#x27;t know how to &quot;pat dry&quot; and entire pot of\n    vegetables, so I just left them to drain in the colander while I made the sauce.\n\n    I covered the baking dish with tin foil.\n\n    It came out OK, if a bit bland. It was pretty soft. It didn&#x27;t have that crispy\n    golden top you want. It was more like &quot;boiled vegetables in cheese sauce&quot;.\n\n    Next time, I should use more pepper and salt. I didn&#x27;t measure this time and\n    while I thought I was generous, I think it could have used more. I guess the\n    potatoes can absorb a lot.\n\n    Also, I think it might work better to boil the potatoes whole and then slice\n    them. It will take longer to boil, but they may end up a little firmer.\n\n    And then maybe cook for a shorter amount of time (after all, the potatoes and\n    leeks are already cooked) and leave it uncovered the whole time.\n\n    -- 2012-10-20\n\n    Cooked it uncovered this time and it came out miles better. Also seasoned the\n    béchamel much more, which helped a lot. I did twenty minutes uncovered, added\n    the cheddar, then another twenty minutes uncovered.\n</code></pre>\nPralines<p><pre><code>    From: http://www.southerncreations.com/Pralines/pralines.html\n    http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/creamy-pecan-pralines-recipe2/index.html?oc=linkback\n\n    Ingredients:\n    - 1- 1/2 cups sugar\n    - 3/4 cups light brown sugar, packed\n    - 1/2 cup + 2 T. Half and Half cream\n    - 1/2 stick unsalted butter\n    - 1 1/2 cups pecans\n    - 1 teaspoon vanilla\n    - 1/4 tsp salt\n\n    (Emeril&#x27;s):\n    1 cup light brown sugar\n    1/2 cup granulated sugar\n    1/2 cup heavy cream\n    4 tablespoons unsalted butter\n    2 tablespoons water\n    1/4 teaspoon salt\n    1 1/2 cups chopped pecans\n\n    Directions:\n\n    1. Combine all ingredients except the pecans and vanilla in a heavy saucepan.\n       Stir until it comes to a boil, then turn heat down to a low boil. Stir\n       occasionally and sparingly; spoon mixture up on sides of pan to melt any\n       sugar that hasn&#x27;t melted.\n\n    2. Cook until the mixture reaches 239 degrees with a candy thermometer. Remove\n       from heat. Stir in the vanilla and the pecans. Stir until the mixture begins\n       to thicken and becomes creamy and cloudy. Spoon onto waxed paper to harden.\n\n       If it starts to harden too quickly, stir in a couple of tablespoons of hot\n       water to soften.\n\n    -- 2013/12/17\n\n    Tried Emeril&#x27;s &quot;Creamy Praline Recipe&quot; first. It came out OK, but grainy. His\n    recipe doesn&#x27;t say to avoid stirring while it&#x27;s boiling. We liked this recipe\n    more. We added a bit more nuts because we felt normal pralines were too much\n    sugar.\n\n    The dash of salt was my addition and is a big help. Maybe try sprinkling a bit\n    of salt as they cool?\n\n    You have to work pretty quickly to spoon them out before it gets too hard. If I\n    need to make a lot, I wouldn&#x27;t do a double batch: it&#x27;s better to just make\n    consecutive batches instead.\n\n    -- 2013/12/18\n\n    On further sampling the next day, the first batch of pralines also came out\n    quite good. Not at all grainy. Not sure about the second batch since most of\n    those got sent out.\n\n    Also, I should try making these with crumbles of maple bacon.\n\n    -- 2014/09/18\n\n    Tried making pumpkin spice ones. Tossed pecans in:\n\n    - 2 tbsp corn syrup\n    - 2 tsp vanilla\n    - 3 tsp pumpkin pie spice\n\n    Baked them for about five minutes at 350° F then followed the recipe as usual.\n    They were assertively pumpkin spice tasting (good) but also incredibly sweet\n    (not so good). The spice ended up coming off the pecans when they were mixed in\n    the pralines. Next time, probably add the pecans after the praline has cooled\n    and is ready to pour.</code></pre>",1411512679

For fun, because I like the food and I like it when others like the food, because it lets me try (and learn about) cuisines whose home cooking I wouldn&#x27;t otherwise get to try. Also because I find it relaxing (sometimes!) and a way to unwind. It requires skill and some creativity and lots of little things to learn and get better at -- but at the same time, a lot of simpler routine steps which you can perform while giving your brain a chance to decompress and your mind to wander a bit.<p>2. Not systematically. I think a lot of the fun of it is seeing what you can make with the ingredients you have lying around and an art to supplementing the set of ingredients with things which will open up possibilities. Also fun to see what&#x27;s marked down in the supermarket and figure out something you can do with it. That said I&#x27;ll usually have one or two meals in mind for a week&#x27;s shop (although might change my mind mid-shop depending on what&#x27;s on offer). And it certainly helps to keep certain staples around that you know you can rely on for a lazy dinner if you don&#x27;t have the energy for something more involved.<p>3. I like to change it up although certain things I keep coming back to in mild variations. Various indian curries, stews (particularly keen on persian and turkish), pasta or polenta with something homemade (fresh pesto, some kind of ragu, simple tomato sauce, putanesca, garlic prawns...), a classic english roast on a weekend, chinese stir-fries, attempts at thai and vietnamese, chilli, pulled pork, something vaguely spanish with chorizo and beans, or vaguely north african, salad, fish, stuffed veggies...<p>4. Not really. An occasional short-lived attempt to cut down on carbs and meat.<p>5. Don&#x27;t rely too much on recipes, use them to bootstrap your intuitions about ingredients, the principles behind different cuisines and formats of dish. Try things, fail. Even if you fail most of the time it&#x27;ll still be edible and perhaps even tasty. Taste things (obvious but bears saying). Learn about individual ingredients and how to use them, herbs spices and seasonings in particular. Seek out new exciting ones. Visit ethnic shops. Make use of the freezer: leftovers, stock, sauces, bargains which you snap up close to expiry. Know what freezes well and what doesn&#x27;t. Get a rice cooker, they&#x27;re great. Don&#x27;t bother with a slow cooker, they create mush and dry meat. Stews are a great way to practise -- hard to screw up too badly, one pot, chance to try out various seasonings and cuisines and get a feel for what works together.\nGet the flavour thesaurus, great little book.",1411511117

If you think that a $7-$10 trade commission is significant barrier to investing, you are not thinking about investing correctly.<p>The key problem I see with the investing world is that 1) most Americans lack a basic understanding of how financial instruments works 2) the media & investing culture encourages a speculative investing mindset that makes most people act like gamblers rather than rational thinkers 3) the incentives are misaligned - financial institutions are not incentivized or built to encourage people to invest smartly.<p>None of these problems are solved from zero trading commission structure. To be honest, this seems like a feature that day & algorithmic traders would care about rather than a normal investor. You could even argue that zero commission trades will exacerbate the issue by pushing the investing mindset to be even more short term focused; this mindset is what causes most investors to lose performance.<p>This seems more like a clever PR angle for Robinhood (&quot;we are helping real Americans&quot;) rather than something impactful.

The contracts that GNOME is going to rely upon are at least going to be pretty well defined, and if you&#x27;ve got another system that works better, it shouldn&#x27;t be hard for it to provide an equivalent, even compatible, interface.<p>If it really is demonstrably better, GNOME and other projects will likely adopt your interface/abstraction, and systemd will end up having to communicate through your interface. Even if they don&#x27;t, it is a comparatively simpler effort for a software community to support a relatively small set of touch points that they want GNOME to be aware of, and maintaining a fork or compatibility layer is a perfectly reasonable solution (indeed, BSD already does this for Linux runtimes).<p>I can understand why it&#x27;d not be a perfect solution from your perspective, but if a bunch of developers contributing to a work you care about are going a direction you don&#x27;t like, it&#x27;s about as good an outcome as one could hope for.",1411510536

It was revolutionary at the time.  I remember when they suddenly started throwing in streaming as a bonus to all the DVD subscribers.  I had no idea that this was where they were going to eventually pivot.  Netflix lured everyone in and changed the video rental industry with it&#x27;s amazing mail-order service.  Any video you wanted to your door in a couple of days.<p>Fast forward to a decade later when there are very few physical stores that rent movies, and Netflix turned into a service of convenience.  No longer is it a service where you can get any movie you want in the next few days.  Rather, it&#x27;s a service where you can get something you&#x27;ll enjoy in the next few seconds.  I&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of the enjoyment now comes from TV series as opposed to movies.<p>At the end of the day I&#x27;m glad there are other alternatives to Netflix such as Amazon Instant Video.  Getting any movie has never been easier than before.  I just hit my Roku and I can watch almost anything within a minute.  Thing is, we are coming off having too much of a good thing.  When Netflix first started, it was easy to consume what you wanted for a low price.<p>Now, if you want to consume exactly what you want -- it might cost you more.  I&#x27;ve found many movies that aren&#x27;t available for rent on Netflix, Itunes, or Amazon.  I have to buy these titles online to watch them!  The other side of the coin is that it&#x27;s never been cheaper to consume such a variety of media using Netflix.  It just might not be exactly what you want.  As long as it&#x27;s good enough for you, though, it&#x27;s good for Netflix&#x27;s bottom line.",1411510515

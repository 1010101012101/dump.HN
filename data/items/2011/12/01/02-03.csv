MSM accounted for 49% of HIV infections in 2008. (Those years are most recent available data.)

With the delimiters, I have two similar things to line up visually. With indentation-significant, I have to line up a delimiter with blank space, which is difficult.",1322708290

3298100,comment,3295448,3297047,4,0,potatolicious,,,"I have some theories, but not a lot of proof - as is the case when arguing the effects of policy.<p>If you look at the job openings in software in Canada, you will find a <i>lot</i> of US satellite offices hiring. Adobe, Autodesk, Apple, IBM, Microsoft, et al all have significant presence across Canada, but the pay for Canadian positions is inevitably far, far less than their American counterparts.<p>Part of it is the lack of entrepreneurialism in the field, I think. Because of the lack of startups, and the lacklustre VC scene, the industry doesn't have lot of domestic legs to stand on. A huge part of the software industry's identity in Canada is ""like America, but cheaper"" - there aren't enough homegrown companies to counter this trend.<p>The software jobs are also dominated by fields where it's a cost centre, not R&D. The biggest employers of software engineers in Canada are banks and telcos, not ""pure"" software companies. In this environment, the majority of openings are IT monkey jobs, not high-level engineering positions.<p>There's a <i>lot</i> of talent coming out of Canada, the majority don't stay though, and they won't so long as the US offers more interesting jobs that pay double, triple the Canadian rate.

He was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, went through treatment, and went into remission in January of 2006. Later that year he went on to start a foundation to raise awareness about the disease and make it his mission to educate people about the urgent need for donating blood, and even more so, bone marrow.<p>I joined the bone marrow database and encourage everyone I know to do the same. The donor card comes with me everywhere I go. Whenever I hear about someone like Mr. Gupta, I try and think of every person possible that might not know one of two very important things:<p>1. Becoming a donor is not as painful as you grew up beleiving it was.\n2. A single day of your discomfort could give someone the rest of their life.<p>Over the course of the next several years, Rich pretty much kept his immediate condition to himself except with his family and few very close friends. This did prove difficult for him since he was someone who was ""notable"" (a term those of us on HN would understand), but upon publication he would always see the silver lining since it helped promote his foundation.<p>On September eighth, 2010, Rich was only 36 years old when he passed away after suffering a stroke secondary to leukemia.<p>Please, do what you can. Every day, do what you can.<p><a href=""http://marrow.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marrow.org/</a>",1322707822

But I did learn the names of assorted corrupt high-level officials in various of the Carribean banking havens Jeff MacNelly once lampooned as Rinky-Dink and Tabasco. No elaborate spying had been required to learn the names; apparently it was routine cafe gossip in the countries involved. So why, I asked, is this material classified? Not that I had any desire to reveal it, but I was curious.<p>The senior security guy in the Criminal Division set me straight: Yes, everyone knew that the Rinky-Dink-and-Tabascanese Finance Minister, or Central Bank president, or whatever it was, was crookeder than a dogs hind leg. He knew, we knew, the Prime Minister knew, the Prime Minister knew we knew, we knew he knew we knew, ad infinitum. Maybe the Rinky-Dink-and-Tabascanese voters didnt know; that was their lookout.<p>But it was our policy to make nice to Rinky-Dink and Tabasco (honest, I forget which contrylet we were talking about). If it were revealed publicly that the US Government had knowledge that Mr. So-and-so was on the take, that would embarrass the Rinky-Dink-and-Tabascanese government, thus impeding U.S. foreign policy. Ergo, <i>properly</i> classified.<p>[unquote]",1322707119

I also think it's a mistake for Google to focus on the x86 platform. If they do it, and they are successful with this, they will be opening the door for Microsoft to come right in and take it all away from them with Windows 8.<p>Windows 8 will be weak on ARM and strong on x86 as a platform, which is why Google should support ARM over x86 for as long as possible. They are once again repeating the mistake with Flash - supporting a technology just to spite Apple, even though it's not in their best long term interest either.<p>Right now, in the tablet market, Apple is not their #1 enemy. Microsoft is. They need to focus on (forever) winning the #2 position after Apple in tablets. After Windows 8 fails to become #2 in tablets, they can then go back to winning the #1 position from Apple. But if they don't focus on getting a <i>strong</i> #2 position right now, and make it impossible for Microsoft to ever get it again (just like they did in smartphones) they risk losing both top 2 positions in tablets, and maybe even more.<p>Also, I really wish they were more pro-active in getting more (a LOT more) developers to make Android tablet apps. Why are they so slow on this? How can Microsoft push for 40,000 apps in one year on a 1% market share platform, and they can't do the same with Android for tablets? Google really needs to get this priority straight because it's vital for the continuing  success of Android.<p>This is not the time to be laid-back about this. They need a very strong showing on tablets by the time Windows 8 appears on them. I still think it's too late for Windows 8 for tablets, but the more laid-back they are about it, the higher the risk is. They need to minimize Microsoft's opportunity as much as possible. This is Google's (and Apple's) chance to stop Windows from dominating the market for another decade.",1322706796

We've thought about it a lot at Mailgun.<p>First of all, alexknowshtml makes some essential points about comparing a commoditized sending service like SES vs. more full feature services.  The biggest one is delivering vs. sending.<p>But, maybe the answer should be to move towards ala carte pricing.<p>If you want just basic sending, then the price is somewhere around the current floor of $0.10 per 1k messages.  But then you can add services like dedicated IPs, analytics, enhanced delivery, whitelabel domains, etc. for extra.  These services could be fixed or variable costs based on the feature.<p>Makes the billing system a lot more complicated, but this seems to make the most sense for the customer.  Allows them to tailor their email service to exactly what they need.",1322705723

For example:<p><pre><code>    object.property\n    .value\n</code></pre>\nCurrently means `object.property.value`. Under your rubric, would it evaluate to `object.value`?

Focuses on SQLite, which is nice, because that way you don't take MySQL's flaws for granted.<p>2. <i>An Introduction to Database Systems</i> by C. J. Date -- academically thorough; it's a textbook, so the previous edition is pennies on the dollar. Mostly covers the relational model itself, rather than SQL, which is somewhat like comparing the pure untyped lambda calculus to Scheme. Once you understand the big ideas, though, everything else is just syntax and performance tuning (which are often implementation-specific anyway).",1247234377

Unless it's a $20million investment for a twitter based replyBot, it looks lame.<p>Meanwhile, plenty of people in the UK (And everywhere else) are building profitable online businesses quietly, just as they have done for years.<p>One thing that has always seemed weird to me is how companies who announce they've ""won $Xm in funding"" seem to be 'rated' higher than companies that are making modest profits and growing fast. IMHO ""winning"" investment just means you convinced someone to give you some money. Whereas a company that's profitable and growing fast, you've proven your business model - far more impressive than convincing a handful of people to give you some cash.<p>Much as I hate a lot of what 37signals have to say, when URL shorteners, twitter crawlers, etc getting millions in funding, you have to ask yourself if that's a good thing, impresive, or just the sign of a large bubble that will burst pretty soon. Building a business on top of another unproven business - is <i>anyone</i> doing any sort of risk assessment here? Or even thinking about business models? Or are they just hyping up the hype to the next level and taking the easy investment money. There's a lot to be said for just being a quietly profitable startup without all the hype+glitz+bs.<p>Just my 2p.",1247234281

AWT specifically excluded widgets that were not natively available on every platform Java ran on. The idea was that they would blend in better this way. The result was a sub par window kit that was only as good as what was available on the worst platform.

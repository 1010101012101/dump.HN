2485134,comment,2484285,2484285,8,0,scott_s,,,"<i>This raises some interesting questions. E.g. why this does not work: [1,2,3].map({2:4}) (in JavaScript)?</i><p>It seems obvious to me why, but the author's question made me realize that I couldn't immediately express <i>why</i> that's not possible. The glib answer is that it doesn't make any sense, but that's not very useful. I think what is more fundamental is that JavaScript, and most other languages, have separate concepts of data and code. A dictionary is data, a function is code.<p>Forgive me that I don't know JavaScript, so I'm going to switch to pseudo-Python for my examples.<p><pre><code>  def f1(n):\n    if (n == 2): return 4\n    return null\n\n  f2 = {2:4}\n</code></pre>\nI said pseudo-Python because in real Python, when I query a dictionary for a value that is not there, it throws an exception. In my pseudo-Python, I'm going to assume that it just returns null. If we assume that, then f1 and f2 can be used to get the same result, even thought they have to called in different ways:<p><pre><code>  res1 = f1(2)\n  res2 = f2[2]\n</code></pre>\nBoth res1 and res2 will have the value 2. In that way, dictionaries can be seen as a kind of function. I'm going to posit that the main reason we don't treat them the same in most languages is efficiency and simplicity. Dictionaries can only represent a limited number of functions - functions with integral and finite inputs. Even so, it will often be quicker to write a closed-form function than to write the full dictionary for a task. For example, if you want an entity that given an <i>N</i> between 1 and 1000 it will return to you the sum of all numbers from 1 to <i>N</i>, it is much easier to just say that this quantity will be <i>N</i>(<i>N</i> + 1) / 2 than it is to exhaustively list all options from 1 to 1000. (Of course, the dictionary could not represent if we wanted something that could handle arbitrarily large <i>N</i>.)<p>Going back to the author's question, if we assume that question was asked with this pseudo-Python, and we could query dictionaries in the same way as functions, then the answer would be [null, 4, null]. Is that useful? I'm not sure. But perhaps there is value in unifying how we call functions and how we query a dictionary. That is, if I give it a value, and it returns a value, it should be invisible to me whether it's a function or a dictionary. I know I can achieve this in C++ with operator overloading, and I think Python gives mechanisms for me to define classes that can behave like this, but there is still a fundamental difference in the language.<p>Lisps, of course, don't have the data-code divide, so querying a data structure and calling a function can look the same. But it's interesting to note that other languages don't have to make the two look different, but they do.<p>Finally, <i>[2,3] + [1,4] gives a string ""2,31,4"" in JavaScript, but shouldn't this produce [2,3,1,4] (which is equivalent to Array.concat([2,3], [1,4]))?</i><p>In most languages I'm familiar with, you will <i>not</i> get a string, but instead a concatenated list. I think that fact is a byproduct of the fact that JavaScript was designed for use in browsers. To the author, try exposing yourself to more languages. What you observe there is a quirk of JavaScript, not all programming languages.",1303825737

Here's the general idea:<p> Each voter can delegate his/her vote to any other voter, in any number of levels. I.e., if Alice delegates her vote to Bob, and Bob delegates his vote to Carol, Carol carries three votes.<p> Delegation of votes can happen at any time, so Alice can delegate her vote to Bob until further notice.<p> Each voter can change their delegate at any time.<p> Each voter can vote for a motion. If the voter has previously delegated his/her vote, the delegate will not carry that voters voting power in this motion. So, if Alice uses her vote in motion 1, Bob only carries one vote and Carlos 2, but only in that motion.<p> Each voter can delegate his/her vote to different voters in different issues; Bob may delegate his vote to Carlos in financial issues, and to Alice in justice issues.<p>My hope is that this would scale to e.g. a nation state, as an alternative direct democracy. Today in Sweden, we delegate our votes to 349 MPs every four years. When introducing my system, that would be the initial state. After that, voters would start delegating their vote to other people that they trust, while using their vote in issues that they know or feel strongly about.<p>This is probably an old idea, and as I stated earlier, I'm guessing there are major flaws with it, so fire away!",1303823170

Nor do they comprehend why it must be fought and how hard it is to fight. This is because most Americans haven't been face-to-face with actual poverty in 50 years and now that it's creeping up on them in the less fortunate reaches of the country, they don't know what is going on.<p>The stores in these towns are dying because people don't have money to spend in them, and because the stores are dying, people have even less money and more stores have to close. It's a self-accelerating process. Even McDonald's is not immune: it's still unaffordable for the truly poor, so as people slide, its revenues are going to decline like everything else. Conservatives believe poverty is a ""moral medicine"" that toughens up the good and kills off the weak. Wrong. It's a cancer.<p>For a more ground-level analysis of this, what actually happens during corporate-chain hiring drives is that the individual stores have tight seatbelts and the budgets often don't increase. The corporate office may decide to have a ""hiring drive"" but it doesn't increase the stores' budgets. The goal of the ""hiring drive"" is not to increase staffing but to take in new people and fire some, or to ensure that workers who are currently getting overtime no longer do. (Workers in low-paid hourly positions often love overtime, but managers don't like having to pay it out.) Thus, hiring new people means that those are there have to take hours cuts or get laid off. Generally, managers would rather keep the people they have than hire someone new and have to cut other peoples' hours, hurting morale across the board. So the incentive structure in such hiring drives is such that very little actual hiring will take place. Serious hiring only happens if (a) the budget increases, or (b) people are working overtime and corporate comes down on the store manager for paying out too much time-and-a-half.",1303822917

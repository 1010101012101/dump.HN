517826,comment,517053,517654,0,0,unalone,,,"One of J. K. Rowling's truly great accomplishments (that is, one of the things that if anything isn't praised <i>enough</i>) is that she takes a very liberal worldview and she portrays it in such a straightforward manner that very few people think to argue with the things she's talking about.<p>She describes a world where there's no difference between men and women. There are heroes and villains on both sides. Furthermore, women aren't made out to be fundamentally superior or inferior in terms of emotion versus ration. She makes the difference <i>apparent</i> - you get dumb guy moments and giggly girl moments - but at the same time, every character has dumb blind emotional moments, and moments where a clear head prevails.<p>She does similar things with racism and libertarianism. (That's not to say Rowling is ultralibertarian, but she expresses certain views - like the fallibility of government and the acknowledgement that people aren't created entirely equal - that promote the agenda, while <i>simultaneously</i> being mature enough to acknowledge that government isn't inherently bad and that people are defined by more than just their talent.) The funny thing is that the one thing she's accused of - promoting witchcraft - is the least radical of the various things she tries to do. Combine that with a very adult understanding of death couched into a book series that, for the first few books, was considered fluff kid fantasy, and you realize that Rowling is very underrated as a kid's author. People ignore her merits for her popularity, which is a shame.<p>Eddings, from all I've heard, is a talented writer, but he's not good at reaching out to a wide audience. He's a niche writer. Rowling, meanwhile, has a talent for making people fall in love with her writing that I've rarely seen in any writer, and she combines that with surprisingly mature plot development.",1237182998

517817,comment,517333,517521,0,0,dantheman,,,"Nope, the semantic web was about reasoning.  Linked data is about linking data, and in effect creating a large distributed database.  One way to think about it, is to consider building a system that stores a tracking code for a package.  Instead of storing XXX-XXXXXX-XXX use the URI so that it can just be deferenced to get more information. In effect you are linking your store data with shippers data.<p>This could allow you to write trivial queries to quickly identify if there are bottlenecks in how your packages are shipped etc.<p>Also the development of SPARQL was a significant milestone, that really changes how one works with rdf.<p>A linked data web could then be used to for reasoning on top of it, but it would need to be large and thus it needs to be useful before the reasoning can be used.  For instance, imagine the original web when people were working on search engines with only a few pages...  The pages need to exist first.",1237182322

When I provided evidence showing that Disney animation got significantly better under Eisner's reign, the claim becomes ""someone else made it better"" and that Eisner did nothing.  Note the unstated retraction of ""killed"".<p>As far as Katzenberg goes, he wasn't created by Imagineering - he was hired by Eisner.  And yes, he eventually left.  That's what successful people do in Hollywood - they move upstream.<p>While the Pixar came to resent the original deal, that deal made them and it was a better deal than they could have gotten elsewhere.  Everyone who breaks big has the same complaint about their early deals and they're all wrong.<p>> Katzenberg ended up founding Dreamworks with Spielberg and they're doing quite well for themselves.<p>Actually, Dreamworks is circling the drain.  They sold the animation division in 2004.  They sold the studio in 2005, and the ""independent filmworks"" division is having trouble raising money for a Spielberg film.  The distribution deal with Disney is not from a position of strength, but to keep the company afloat.

But that ignores how important and useful friends are.<p>Like it or not, people today talk a lot on Facebook. I talk to people back at my high school fairly often. I keep in touch with people I couldn't keep in touch with otherwise. And with the various dramas and photos and notes that appear on Facebook, I've both had some interesting experiences with people and I've preserved memories of things that've happened offline.<p>Maybe I lose something by having that all online (mind you, in a place where only 90 other people can see it, rather than in some place public), but I gain far more. It's similar to how I'm willing to write about personal matters on my blog. I can imagine an employee coming across my writing about a failed relationship or about incidents about college, but I gain more from being able to publish my thoughts candidly than I lose from their disapproval.<p>My line of thinking goes: if my employer is such an ass as to search through my past to see if I've done questionable things, then either I've done a piss-poor job of making myself into a good candidate, or he's not somebody worth my working for.

Our judgment of significance is significantly colored by our finite sense of time.  Just think of what seemed like a long time to you at 3 vs at 30.

In the Bayesian interpretation, you can have a reasonable prior that you update as you collect more data.  For example, a meteorologist can look at the clouds and ""guesstimate"" that there's a 50% chance of rain tomorrow.  A frequentist would object and say that you can't take lots of random samples of tomorrow to estimate that probability.  The Bayesian is willing to take the meteorologist's guess as a prior, and update it as & when more data becomes available.

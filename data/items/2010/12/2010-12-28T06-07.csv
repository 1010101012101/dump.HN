2044872,comment,2043941,2044181,0,0,wtallis,,,"The rather extraordinary claim that a future version of android will be able to ""automagically"" adjust the UI to suit screen size needs some serious evidence to back it up.<p>Obviously, the operating system is not going to be able to produce the same design decisions that would be made in light of actual experimentation with real users - it will be based on heuristics that will produce sub-optimal results for just about any combination of screen size and resolution other than the original. So I'll assume that you merely meant to assert that the scaling will produce results that are ""good enough"" in that normal users won't notice that the UI doesn't fit their tablet.<p>Even the claim that it will be ""good enough"" seems outlandish. Consider the kinds of scalable GUIs that exist on desktops: the important elements of the GUI (like toolbars, menus, and standard buttons) don't get re-sized. At best, they get wrapped or scrolled, either of which is instantly recognizable as a bad design. Most of the sizing flexibility on desktop apps is in the areas that show relatively static content that the user only interacts with passively, like in a web browser or video player, or in the case of many types of games, areas that you only interact with in small bits at a time. (Word processors alternate between the presentation of static content and the interaction (ie. editing) of one spot at a time.)<p>On a multitouch display with direct manipulation of the GUI, you will typically have far fewer opportunities for the easy scalability that web browsers and word processors enjoy. You have to know which UI elements need to maintain the same physical size, which ones need to maintain the same pixel dimensions, and what the limits are on the scalability of the other elements.<p>Take as an example the iPad email app. In landscape mode, you have a list of messages on the left (showing subjects, the first line of the body, and a few other pieces of info), and the body of the currently selected message shown on the right. The right pane takes up about 2/3 of the screen width.<p>If you were to scale this app from the 4:3 iPad display to a 16:9 tablet, how would the left/right split ratio have to change? It's complicated: the entries in the left-side list will have to maintain roughly the same physical height, because they are essentially buttons. You probably want the left pane to remain at least as many characters wide as in the original, so the physical width won't change by much, but you have some flexibility in font sizes. That means that the right pane showing the body of the email will probably be slightly wider and shorter on a 10"" 16:9 tablet, but on a significantly smaller tablet, the left/right split might be 50/50.<p>All that is merely a first approximation of how that one app would have to scale. Could a computer derive that? How will the operating system know what the driving constraints are? The OS certainly can't know whether it is better on average to use the extra width of the 16:9 tablet to show more of the subject lines on the left or more of the body on the right.<p>It seems that the only way to make a scalable touch UI work is for the designer to bake in the constraint information, which will require testing at different sizes. This obviously doesn't save any work if you are only targeting two sizes. How many different sizes do you need to target before the rule-based scaling has a significant advantage over manually tuning the different sizes? Whatever that number, Android will exceed it and Apple probably won't. However, this completely ignores the need for more drastic design changes when the difference in sizes is very big, such as between the iPhone and the iPad.<p>And such discontinuities in the scaling hardly require that big a disparity: according to AnandTech's review of the Samsung Galaxy Tab (<a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/4062/samsung-galaxy-tab-the-anandtech-review/3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/4062/samsung-galaxy-tab-the-an...</a>) which is a 7"" 16:9 tablet, the best way to type on it is in portrait orientation using your thumbs, whereas on the iPad (9.7"" 4:3) you are better off using both hands in landscape. On a 10"" 16:9 tablet, you have even more width in landscape mode to accommodate typing with both hands, but how is the OS supposed to know that in portrait mode it is still too wide for two-thumb typing?<p>The only really good scalable UI engine I know of is LaTeX, which outputs completely static content, but can handle a wide range of paper sizes without the author needing to worry about margins, and all the font sizes can be scaled with a single change to the header of the source file. Even so, it doesn't know when the paper size is large enough that you should switch to a two-column format.",1293519589

2044869,comment,2044356,2044356,0,0,codeslush,,,"I appreciate the post as I haven't read it before.  I am confident I'm an introvert I definitely NEED my quiet time - plenty of it.  I absolutely suck at small talk.  In fact, it's one of the things that causes me the most anxiety about business meetings.  I'm cool with the meeting/presentations/etc..., but if we have to go to lunch or dinner, I'm petrified!<p>Below are a couple of things that help me, and I'm curious if other introverts have adopted any tools to help them:<p>1.  Alcohol!  Of course, this isn't always appropriate, but it does seem to work.  Hah.<p>2.  Adopt a passion in a subject that is applicable to a large audience that falls outside your primary expertise.  For example - Fitness.  As the article states, introverts are perfectly capable of engaging in conversations that interest them without the exhaustion that comes with normal small talk.  Most people are interested in fitness.  Therefore, if the introvert is highly interested in fitness, it stands to reason that he can steer a conversation in that direction and engage with a wide array of personalities.  Food/Nutrition, Travel, history are other examples that might work.<p>How about you?",1293519490

The book itself is very thought-provoking, so much so that I haven't stopped thinking about it since reading it a month or so ago. The criticisms in this review are certainly valid, and this is one of those books I doubt anyone could agree 100% with, but what is missing from this review is an appreciation for Kelly's valiant attempt to grapple with the enormity of what technology has wrought, and the even greater enormity of what technology seems poised to do in the future.

I had a really similar experience.<p>First, with BBS's on my Packard Bell Pentium 60mhz (got from Costco, had that famous floating point bug).  That's when I learned the difference between a local call and a local ""toll"" call (same area code as you doesn't mean local...oops)<p>Then I got on AOL (starting with 2.0 for DOS I think), Prodigy, CompuServe, and eventually MSN.<p>On AOL I ran into those ""proggies"" and met a guy named Cybermun who explained to me how to write them (he wrote AoHades).  He gave me a copy of VB 3.0.  I found it totally accessible in that I could design my UI point-and-click and then figure out how to make it work.<p>I'd ask Cybermun questions endlessly and he'd never answer directly, always forcing me to figure it out.  My dad bought me a copy of the white book (The C Programming Language, Kerningham and Ritchie) Hung out in private room ""warez2"" most of the time.<p>I was ""WalrusPowr"" (and a dozen variants of that name).  Every time I entered a chat room I'd announce myself with some funny string and ""{s walrus""  (remember that!?  It would play a .wav file, provided you had a file with that name).<p>After some time I wrote a relatively popular shareware app called AoLOL! (worked on AOL 2.5 thru 4).  Each week folks would mail me a check for $14.95 for registration.<p>AoLOL! added a row of icons to the AOL toolbar and gave you a bunch of extra functionality (most notably a ""keep in touch"" feature, which would cycle through a list of friends and automatically check if they were online).  This was before the Buddy List and before ICQ had launched.  Incidentally, I was put in touch with the founding ICQ team, let them use my AOL account to play with the recently launched AOL buddy list, fixed the broken English on their web site, etc. (they were four young Israelis).  They offered me a job but I was in high school, had no drivers license, etc.  My UIN is 104006 (they started at 100,000).<p>I also wrote an app called ""AoLMNOP"" which was a bit of a joke.  It launched of ""Ao"" proggies and generally mocked the entire scene.<p>I can't tell you how many hours I spent staring into a 14"" CRT between 10PM at 4AM chatting and ""coding"" (VB3 and mostly ""Sendkeys"".  Some Windows API calls.  Ha!) while my parents thought I was asleep.<p>My younger brother tells me he'd wake up to the sound of me laughing out loud and hammering away at my keyboard.

That already saves a lot of time screening people you wouldn't want for those top positions.<p>2) It attracts other smart people because you wouldn't refer puzzles to stupid people -- notice how we posted it on Hacker News. On a similar note, if you google for Node.js like I did, you'll find a sponsored result from Meebo offering you to apply to their ""secret jobs!"" -- because not just anyone searches for Node.js, but rather people who are interested in the new technology, which they are probably using or looking into.<p>3) Psychology -- people feel like they want something they worked towards. They committed time to facebook, so they will take it more seriously, and when someone from facebook talks to them, and asks them about their background AFTER solving the puzzle, they will feel a sense of accomplishment and engage back.<p>4) Notice how many of these puzzles have specified the exact outputs. They can screen the initial applicants with an automated test suite to see how well they did. Cheapest first round candidate evaluation ever :)<p>5) The puzzles are hopefully related to the kinds of architectural and social challenges they actually have to solve at facebook, so this prepares the candidate for that kind of thinking.

2044800,comment,2044261,2044657,0,0,chipsy,,,"Inertia. From a technical standpoint the game industry is about customer-facing features that happen to also be technologies. You can go from one product to another carrying along many of those features, but change the language and you blow them all up.<p>Today you have a ""legacy"" group of AAA developers with huge, well-tuned C++ engines designed specifically around that dev model(typically, lots of scripted and hand-crafted static content with photorealistic graphics and in-game cutscenes), and a growing number on the indie/mobile/web/social side who are using whatever is convenient, and often rolling their own thing to fit their own projects. For many that still means C++ since they're already familiar with it, there's plenty of examples and library code around, and some targets still demand(or literally require, in the case of consoles) that mix of tooling, performance and features. For others it might be Java, Objective C, Actionscript, or Javascript.<p>The value proposition of a new language isn't great for the AAA developer because the engine coding effort - on a large project - is tiny compared to the content. For tiny games most of the pressure to ship is on programming - but once you're past the core engine(resources, scene/entity/rendering management, collision, events, etc.), the benefits are still unclear since most gameplay coding uses the same patterns in any language - lots of intermittent special-case logic, blobs of state accessable through various indexes, timing, and sequencing. These things can usually get parceled out to a scripting language for faster iteration(or, at minimum, designer-driven iteration, vs. coder+designer pairing).<p>I haven't mentioned parallelism once yet, notice. Despite Tim Sweeney's focus on this in his slides, it's not a big concern for anyone but the AAA guys who are specifically aiming to max out the hardware. The gameplay proper is hard to enforce in-parallel because most game designs are massively stateful and interdependent. That leaves rendering and miscellaneous auxiliary processes. Rendering quality is now bottlenecked mostly by the content creation process, not by runtime concerns. We can always throw more polygons into a scene, but the details of shading, texturing, and animation have become far more important to image quality.<p>Look at what Valve and Blizzard are doing. They've both stayed far away from the cutting edge in their own technology, and that hasn't hurt them a bit in sales. So again, there's just very little reason to move forward on the tech if you aren't an indie, and if you are then you have to weigh your choice against how difficult it'll be to ship the final product to consumers. The math tends to favor one of the languages mentioned earlier(C++, Obj C, JS, AS3, Java).",1293516493

Any effort to break old routines can result in replacing old, unexamined habits with better ones.<p>Case in point:  I read an article in the Financial Times several years back about how Norwegian companies adapted to the quota law requiring 40% of board members to be female.  Norwegian companies were kind of at a loss because they normally recruited directors out of a pool of candidates known to their current directors and executives.  They knew those traditional candidates very well, often personally, and knew their skills, qualifications, and trustworthiness.  Unfortunately, that pool didn't include very many women.<p>The companies were leery of hiring complete strangers into their boardrooms.  Still, they were stuck with it, so they did their best.  They identified skills and knowledge that would complement their existing boards and launched international searches for qualified candidates.  Just by taking those steps, which most of companies had never bothered with before, they discovered a huge number of stellar candidates with skills that were completely lacking in Norwegian boardrooms.  The candidates they found were significantly younger, more accomplished, and more internationally savvy than the usual old boys' club candidates.  Result:  big win for Norwegian corporations.  Instead of looking at a few dozen old Scandinavian men, they started recruiting out of a huge pool of international talent.  Being limited to female candidates was a minor factor at that point.

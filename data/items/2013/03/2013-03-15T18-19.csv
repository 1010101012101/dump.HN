5382299,story,,,1,0,rgovind,"Ask HN: What features do you want in modern debuggers?",,"I am trying to build a better debugger for C/C++ and hopefully for Python and Javascript. I am not too happy single stepping through various lines of code to see what got executed and what did not. When a program stops at a breakpoint, I think debuggers should be visually able to show which lines got executed so far and which didn't. This would really help in speeding up the process of debugging (especially new programs)<p>What other features do you think must be present in a modern debugger?",1363373997

5382294,comment,5379725,5379725,2,0,languagehacker,,,"Cool post, Andy. NLTK is a lot of fun, but it's not necessarily a production-ready solution -- for instance, scaling it out to other languages may pose some problems with respect to utf-8. NLTK's real purpose is more for pedagogy, and your blog post is a nice addition to teaching people Python and computational linguistics at the same time.<p>You might be interested in checking out pattern ( <a href=""http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern</a> ). It has a heuristic approach to sentiment analysis built right in that might be worth comparing your features against.<p>Finally, as far as classification goes, Python is pretty all right, but can be a tad slow working through large amounts of data. I've found that text classification at scale is best left to an external library, with Python doing feature extraction and managing the data pipeline. In the past I've built out feature sets with Python and then passed them to TADM ( <a href=""http://tadm.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tadm.sourceforge.net/</a> ). The advantage of TADM is that, being written in C++, it's meticulously optimized. Of course, you have fewer modeling options available to you. That's just one example; there are plenty of these kinds of services written in Java, too, for instance.<p>Thanks for a good read!",1363373957

However, for anyone who still uses Reader on a regular basis who might be able to comment on this, I think Yonatan might be missing the point. It seems he's looking to incorporate individual features/aspects of Reader into G+ in order to woo newly disenfranchised users back into the Google ecosystem. The problem is that I think this is a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.<p>Even if he incorporated a large subset of Reader features into G+, I think at best that would likely only capture the wants of a small fraction of the Reader user base given that both products have inherently different goals. G+ is, depending on how you look at it, either a full-fledged social network or a central identity service connecting various components of the Google ecosystem. Reader is a dedicated, decentralized (in the sense that the feeds themselves come from outside Google) RSS consumer. Both products seemingly have different philosophical approaches to the web (walled-garden vs. generally open) and I'm not sure that can be reconciled so easily.<p>These musings are off the top of my head though, so I'd love to hear thoughts from any avid Reader users and/or G+ engineers/users who agree/disagree.",1363373389

So a lot of job motion (or not) is from other employees who refer their friends, or suggest that the company pass. Once someone has gone through one of the 'grinders'[1] they get some visibility to other people who worked with them or was aware of them.

And the guy I was calling would typically consider it a favor to me, not to the hire. In fact, failing to call, or to have a network of people who could help on hiring references, purchase references, occasional technical and best-practice questions, would be failing networking 101 and the real no-no at that level. Of course, this would be when an offer was about to be made, and not to anyone who wasn't supposed to know about the hire, or whose discretion couldn't be relied on, and just 1-2 people.<p>Of course, randomly contacting a bunch of people via LinkedIn would have been bad judgment and a reason for the candidate to question working for someone who would risk putting them in an embarrassing spot.<p>Also, I don't really agree with the most direct in-your-face questions in the post <i>unless</i> you know the reference <i>really</i> well. If I was the reference those questions would make me uncomfortable and I would shut down the call pretty quick. Would almost make me think the candidate had a buddy testing me for what type of reference I was giving, which is not totally unheard of.<p>Also, my experience is the check is mostly to check for the red flag, make sure their description of role was accurate, maybe confirm/fill in a gap about something you might not get the full story about from the applicant, how much were they really involved in X, circumstances of departure, basic strengths, weaknesses, would you hire again. If you can't do the technical / cultural fit yourself you're gonna have a bad time.<p>Other than that, I'm surprised at the pushback... for the most part this is the way it's done.",1363372293

You're oddly demanding in a casual non-technical online discussion about a topic you don't seem qualified in, so if this isn't enough for you we really aren't going to find common ground.<p>There isn't great library support for deep networks. This is a big deal, I don't want to spend tons of time building my own library or working with buggy/poorly supported/infant libraries. In production systems we prefer extremely well-established libraries that work in our language/environment of choice. Also deep belief networks are a couple orders of magnitude slower than linear models (probably the most commonly used type of model in industry). They require more parameter selection. They're not even useful for a lot of tasks - if I'm already spending tons of time building useful features (often a requirement in industry for non-technical reasons, like reporting or legal constraints) deep networks aren't going to be very useful. Much of their utility is taking raw, unstructured data and creating useful features for a supervised model.

I filled out an online form on the police site, never got a response. One day, cop pulls me over, then draws on me and gets 4 other cops as backup.

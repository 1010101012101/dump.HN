It is their introduction of what the author considers &quot;unnecessary formalism&quot; that made us finally really understand &quot;mathematics of motion&quot; ...&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think so.<p>99.99% of the mathematics of motion consists of continuous functions with continuous derivatives of all orders. Infinitesimals are just fine for that. I find the epsilon-delta construction (EDC) to be not only inordinately clunky but to provide no insight whatsoever insofar as motion is concerned. From a pedagogical standpoint EDC is roughly the equivalent of tossing a monkey wrench into the smoothly oiled and finely-working innards of the mathematics of motion. The student&#x27;s mind grinds to a screeching halt as (s)he attempts to come to terms with a new construct that not even a mathematician&#x27;s mother could love. I consider any praise of the epsilon-delta construction of  calculus to be little more than turd-polishing and while it is unfortunately necessary, there is no need to call attention to it more than once. And once pointed out, best forgotten.<p>One of the most underrated advancements in mathematics is  Descarte&#x27;s introduction of Cartesian coordinates. The formalization of the calculus, in contrast, was a step backwards in creative terms. Although necessary, it is of interest mostly to pure mathematicians.",1376113689

You can redact the names and still publish what the law is.<p>And there is a difference between collecting intelligence on foreign governments (which I don&#x27;t think anyone could ever expect not to happen) and mass data collection. Part of the problem here is that spying on &quot;terrorist&quot; &quot;suspects&quot; is so broad and poorly defined that it could encompass nearly anything and becomes nothing but a convenient fig leaf for mass surveillance.<p>We lump too many things under the label of terrorism. Someone with the likes of a machete or a hand grenade is distinctly a law enforcement problem rather than a national security problem and cannot justify secret mass surveillance or data collection.<p>Once you take all of that out and get to the actual national security threats (i.e. nuclear or biological terrorism) you end up with a completely different threat model. More to the point, you need to keep a lot less secret because instances of attempted nuclear terrorism are much more rare.

I think my first starting point was &quot;Mathematics and the Imagination&quot; or &quot;Gdel&#x27;s Proof.&quot; Mathematics and the Imagination is a good high level overview, and would provide some foundational notions that&#x27;ll reappear repeatedly -- but, it won&#x27;t given you any practice in mathematical methods. For that I would recommend &quot;What is Mathematics?&quot; by Courant and Robbins. Can be pretty challenging, but you&#x27;ll actually get somewhere if you put effort into it. If you haven&#x27;t had much experience with proofs, it&#x27;s worth focusing briefly on the process of proving explicitly as a preliminary. That&#x27;s actually a good thing to do with another person or in a class -- can be pretty difficult to get some of the subtleties involved, and to know when you&#x27;ve done things correctly or not.<p>I mention &quot;Gdel&#x27;s Proof&quot; because it&#x27;s the first thing I came across that informed me I am in fact interested in mathematical systems. I&#x27;m more interested in architectures than problem solving though. If you suspect that might be the case for yourself, might check it out -- it&#x27;s about 100 pages.",1376110935

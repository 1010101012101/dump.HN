If she's not an intelligent, driven woman who goes out to get what she wants, then how can I respect her? If I don't respect her, it is bound to show eventually.<p>If I recall correctly, in Blink Malcolm Gladwell mentioned that one of the biggest predictors of divorce likelihood, for both sexes, was if one mate felt superior (in a dismissive way) to the other. I imagine that would have an even greater effect on a marriage than any of the statistics mentioned in this article.",1234177185

Better get your act together then.<p>And beware of that neighbor...<p>Women have been on the receiving end of their men 'trading up' for years, the equality game has its downsides, but this isn't one of them.

If it's not incorporated and you're self employed, as long as your ""trade"" isn't ""buying and selling Web sites"" then if you have a separate site that produces money, you can sell its intellectual property and pay capital gains on it (rather than income).

473270,story,,,15,9,giles_bowkett,"Ask HN: why not an API?",,"We get all these ideas about why not do X, why not do Y, etc. Let's just let these people implement their ideas.<p>In the Rails world web apps are set up to have APIs by default. That way if somebody thinks a site should be better in a particular way, they don't have to ask anybody's permission or convince other people. They just build it, and if they were right, then people use it, and if they were wrong, they know for sure, instead of nursing a grudge for years about their great underappreciated feature idea or blah blah blah.<p>It's much more interesting to have a lot of people building different clients for your system than it is to speculate about what might or might not be a good change. Speculation overlooks the fact that these changes are implementation-specific, and the fact that you won't know how you like it until you try it. When a bunch of different people build a bunch of different clients, you find out for a fact what is or isn't a good idea by looking at what clients succeed and what clients fail, as well as what features everybody copies vs. what ideas die on the vine.<p>A good example is Twitter. I tried most of the popular clients, hated them, stuck with the Web interface, and then Tweetie came along for iPhone. now I prefer to read Twitter on my iPhone even if I'm sitting at my computer, because it's just better (in most cases) than the Web interface. Something like 80% of Twitter's traffic is API traffic, not Web traffic, because practically everyone has a favorite client that isn't the Web site.<p>I know people find my blog posts about what's wrong with Hacker News interesting. But the thing is, I am not one of those people. I am so bored with talking about what's wrong with Hacker News. And as boring as my own posts about the subject are, all you other people who post Ask HN links about the subject, your posts are even more boring. Wouldn't you find an alternate HN interface implementing my ideas more interesting than reading me rant? Wouldn't you rather build alternate HN interfaces than whine to pg as if he were your daddy?<p>Lacking an API, I've resorted to hackery. Eric from Internet Duct Tape wrote me a Greasemonkey script which auto-filters Hacker News for links to domains I don't want to see and hides those links. Ironically my own blog is on that list; I don't want to get into comment wars here or anywhere.<p>I still hear about it from friends and co-workers when my blog ""charts"" here, but I can tell you all that a HN which makes comment wars impossible or at least harder to get into is much, much better than a Hacker News which makes them easy. I also have a 100% Arrington-free Hacker News through the same script, and let me tell you, my Hacker News is ABSOLUTELY more fun to read than yours. More fun for me to read, anyway, which is really the main point. What one person needs out of a user interface will be different from what another person needs. User interface should vary by user. You can customize Photoshop and you can customize emacs. You should be able to customize any Web app as well.",1234175709

473237,comment,472964,473174,0,0,tc,,,"You've chosen to defend a group you're familiar with (bankers) only to unfairly demonize other groups you haven't thought enough about.  Let's see:<p><i>1) Stupid ""homeowners""</i><p>How many of these people were really stupid?  Many of these new home buyers had no assets to begin with.  Banks were willing to let them live in a nice house for a few years.  In the worst case, they'll probably end up back where they started.  This clearly isn't the best way to manage one's personal finances, but it wasn't totally irrational.<p><i>2) Shark-like loaners</i><p>People were pouring in to mortgage brokers and asking for loans.  If mortgage broker A decided to stop processing paperwork for people asking for a loan, home buyers would have just gone across the street to mortgage broker B (and A would go out of business).<p>Mortgage brokers just process paperwork - the clients decide they want a loan, the banks make the lending decisions.  Demonizing them makes absolutely no sense.<p><i>3) Bond structurers</i><p>This was a profitable business for years.  Professional investors wanted these securities.  If you were in this business, who are you to argue with your customers?  Besides, many of the buyers were of the highest caliber, Freddie, Fannie, and government pension funds.<p><i>5) Regulatory authorities</i><p>Regulatory agencies are designed to preserve the status quo, not challenge it.  The rational interests of the regulators (such as not challenging the politically powerful) are almost always in conflict with the highest social welfare.  Saying regulatory agencies failed is so predictable that it's nearly a tautology.<p><i>4) Dumb lawmakers</i><p>OK, we can agree on one :)<p>The finer point, though, is to see how bad laws caused all the other market actors to make rational decisions that worked against the overall social welfare.<p>For example, if money is free (as it was to banks, because the interest rate was held below the rate of inflation), then how much money should you borrow?

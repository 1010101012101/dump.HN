It essentially has the same effect as morphine or oxycodone, both of which are prescribed legally (my dad has been on morphine for a few years, extended release so he doesn&#x27;t get high.. but it also doesn&#x27;t kill him).<p>The biggest danger is indeed purity - if you think that &quot;x&quot; amount is the right dose for your tolerance (and tolerance not only varies based on how much a user has had before, but also on that person&#x27;s body in the first place) but one batch you buy is y% pure and the next batch is 2y% pure, you can accidentally dose yourself twice as much as you are expecting and overdose.<p>Of course overdose is possible with drugs where you completely know the strength - such as oxycontin pills - but with semi-sensible use it&#x27;s a lot harder, since you actually know how much of the drug you&#x27;re taking.<p>Yes it can be addictive, but if you never over do it and can afford to keep buying clean drugs like oxycontin you&#x27;re most likely going to be fine. The biggest risk with prescription painkillers like this is not that they&#x27;ll kill you, but that you&#x27;ll become addicted to them and, when you either can&#x27;t get another prescription or can&#x27;t afford your illegal purchases, you move onto heroin because it&#x27;s much cheaper per dose. Cheaper per dose, but also less pure and therefore more likely to be dangerous.<p>I personally wouldn&#x27;t try heroin because I don&#x27;t want to become dependant on something (other than tobacco..), but if it was completely pure then addition would be the only thing that scared me away from it, not fear of death from using it.",1446637680

As it is, for my family, we&#x27;re paying an extra $5k/year for essentially the same high deductible plan we had 3 years ago.  Paying that by being forced in to private insurance feels wrong - paying it via FICA (or some other more general tax) feels easier.  There&#x27;s still 10s of millions who have not bought in to private insurance, because the costs are still too high for them (or they opt out for other reasons), so we&#x27;re still left with millions uninsured but many people paying more.  &quot;Health insurance&quot; != &quot;health care service&quot; which has been the biggest problem in the debate for years.",1446637046

Thoughtful Ain't it?",http://blogs.manageengine.com/netflowanalyzer/2008/07/16/billing-using-netflow-thoughtful-aint-it/,"Have you been in this situation:<p>Say, you are the network administrator/manager in your organization. You have been asked to find out exactly how much IT expense each department(ex: finance, HR..) incurs, in your organization. And you do not have much to spend.<p>Or you are a service provider and everyday you come across customers asking you for a different bill plan. A customized bill plan! You also want to save time by automating the periodic bill generation as per the schedule. All this with no additional infrastructural cost. It can be done!<p>Yes. Manageengine NetFlow Analyzer  has a solution for you. With no additional infrastructure cost, it helps you to charge-back based on the bandwidth utilized. All this is done using the NetFlow data exported from the router to the NetFlow Analyzer. Usage based billing is a very useful feature for service providers and enterprises. The value this adds to the traffic analysis and network forensics is tremendous. With the ever increasing need to curb IT expense, the popularity of this feature is on the rise.<p>Check out the free 30 day trial<p>Thoughtful! Ain’t it?<p>Joe",1228744339

389817,comment,389304,389357,0,0,rapind,,,"In short, yes. A little less extreme though would be to guarantee privacy and security to all stored files, and should any changes occur to the current policy, users should be notified and given the option to completely wipe all of their data or continue using the service. That to me is common sense. Under no circumstances should an acquisition impact the user's privacy and security.<p>As for encrypting data before it's uploaded. Sure, I mean if you believe their target demographic is tech-savy enough. Which probably means a small fraction of their current users.<p>I think security in the cloud has to be a shared a responsibility between users and providers, for all cloud apps. Telling your users that it's their sole responsibility is ridiculous and not very competitive... unless you're releasing an open source offering to sysadmins. Technology has gotten so confusing for the typical end user that of course they're not going to invest the time to understand what cloud security even is, whether or not you believe they should.",1228743539

Which means I should also take full responsibility for the performance complaints that have shown up in this thread.<p>Someone in the thread mentioned that they're ""not sure how you could screw up a web app this simple."" I'm entirely sure how we screwed it up.<p>My friend came up with the idea, designed the layout, and I built it. It was a spare time thing, just for fun. When we launched we seeded the database with a couple hundred questions and put it out there. Somehow (thank you Twitter, Tumblr, etc), the site saw 10,000 uniques in its first day, which exposed the fact that I'd over-normalized the database to death, and the site could hardly function. We launched at 11am, and by 3pm I was on the phone with mediatemple to upgrade the server just so there'd be enough memory to allocate an ssh session.<p>I spent a sleepless 72 hours after that rebuilding the architecture to try and make it scale, which it did -- for a while.<p>But now we've got a database with 13 million votes in it, and the app must cross-reference those votes with a user guid so as to serve fresh content, and it's simply outgrown whatever fixes I was able to make during that marathon coding weekend.<p>I haven't done any work on it in months, yet every so often it pops up somewhere on the web and guilts me into thinking I should probably re-architect it once again...<p>So if I don't sleep or leave my apartment this weekend I've got you all to thank :)",1228743378

I think if enough geeks stopped copying music and movies and took on a position of ""only what's legal"" we'd rapidly build alternative culture streams that would be all of good, legal, and free of retriction. Part of the problem is that people's brains are poisoned. For example, many musicians I meet are hard-wired into the idea that they need to protect their work, when in fact they would most benefit by getting their music and their names out there and then benefiting from more audiences at gigs, and better jobs (teaching opportunities, partnership deals to produce jingles for advertising and anything else that comes by way of their increased network).",1228742534

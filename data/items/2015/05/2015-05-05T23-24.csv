Explanation: this gives you three &quot;flavors&quot; of preprocessing.  &quot;.ct&quot; files are &quot;C preprocessor templates&quot;; they are put through cpp. &quot;.mt&quot; files are M4 templates: M4 is used. And &quot;.st&quot; are shell templates; they use shell here-doc syntax.<p>The shell templates do not have to have any &quot;cat <<&quot; or &quot;!&quot;; this wrapping is added by the Makefile. Of course, you can&#x27;t have a line consisting of ! in these files; you have to escape such a thing if it occurs.<p>Additionally, for .ct and .mt files, all environment variables are turned into macros in that language, with their names mapped to the the _ENV_* namespace.  For .st and .mt files, the __FILE__ macro is established which expands to the file name (the C preprocessor has this built-in).<p>I used this in an embedded Linux distro that I build from scratch (targetting MIPS embedded hardware).  It was used for generating some of the textual materials in the target file system tree. For instance /etc/hosts was generated from a .st template, and populated using a $(for ...) loop.<p>Yes, I do Lisp <i>and</i> I do stupid. :)",1430869921

When you try to model employers choosing who to hire from their pool of applicants, you need to work really hard in specifying the model to get demand curves to slope downward. In other words, &quot;price&quot; often gets the wrong sign, meaning it looks like the higher the bid, the more likely an applicant is to get hired. What&#x27;s going on is that clients can and will pay more for better, more experienced developers and these developers bid accordingly. <i>However</i> as a freelancer, finding those kinds of employers can be a challenge.<p>To help deal with this search problem, we asked employers up front to state their relative preferences over price and quality. For example, employers could state they were looking for high quality at a high price, or less experienced workers at a lower price.  During the experimentation phase, we randomized whether these employer/client preferences were revealed to applying freelancers. We found that we could induce substantial sorting by freelancers to job/employers of the &quot;right&quot; type, raising wages and project sizes at the high end. This feature is now universal and helps freelancers get in front of clients that are a good fit for them.<p>(2) After <i>very</i> extensive experimentation, oDesk did in fact impose a minimum wage. It was set at price point that improved the quality of people getting hired, but was not so high that jobs weren&#x27;t being filled. Obviously, this level of minimum wage doesn&#x27;t touch the high-end of the market, but picking minimum wages is a real balancing act and setting it too high can definitely price some work out of the market. It also &quot;pulls up the ladder&quot; and prevents new workers from getting started in the market, which oDesk understandably wants to avoid.<p>(3) There is a problem with too many low quality applications. The problem is similar to what&#x27;s going on in college admissions---because it&#x27;s cheap to apply, people apply to almost every school, whether or not it&#x27;s a good fit. oDesk recently started using the Elance &quot;Connects&quot; system that imposes a meaningful quota on applications, which in turn seems to be improving application quality. It is hard problem though, because if you set the quota to high, you get the bad spam equilibrium, and if you set it too low, you choke off liquidity.<p>(4) There is a problem with inflated reputations---it&#x27;s a general problem in online marketplaces, particularly those with bilateral reputation systems. However, oDesk has done something quite clever which seems to be working well, which is collecting <i>private</i> feedback from both workers and clients after a contract and then eventually disclosing non-identifiable aggregates of those ratings to future employers/workers. These ratings are far more truthful on a host of measures, are harder to subvert by begging for good feedback and so far, aren&#x27;t getting inflated.",1430867411

You could as well place a ledger on a table next to a camp fire and everyone can come to the fire, throw some bank notes into it and this allows him to fill a page in the ledger. Same thing. And it really makes no economic sense because the money is totally wasted. I don&#x27;t doubt that there may be a successful cryptocurrency one day, but it will not be based on proof of work.<p>When you think about it closely mining is just a way to establish identity in an anonymous system. You want to reach consensus on which transactions should go into the next block and which not, but because you also want anonymity you can not just ask everyone for a vote because nothing prevents the bad guy from having a billion false identities all voting for his bad intention. And here mining comes into play, it makes voting expensive and prevents you from casting a lot of votes. Hundreds of millions every year just to agree on which transactions to include in the block chain. It does not even help in any way to protect transactions because they are entirely protected by public key cryptography.<p>Had Bitcoin a central authority you could for example just require everyone to send a copy of their ID in exchange for some cryptographic key that would give you one vote. Then you could just propose blocks of transactions and let everyone cast a vote and the winning block gets added to the block chain. No mining required and transactions become extremely cheap, at least if you manage to build an efficient central ID checking authority.<p>This is of course pretty unlikely to happen because it is against some of the core ideas of Bitcoins but any cryptocurrency that can avoid mining will have a huge economical advantage over Bitcoin and any other proof of work based system and will eventually replace them. Proof of stake is one idea but with its own problems. I think it is most likely that the winning solution has not yet been invented.<p>I digress. Okay, Bitcoin is expensive by design because the security is proportional to the amount of money burned in mining. The number of processed transactions is not directly coupled to the mining costs and therefore the costs per transaction can go down when processing more transactions but they are not completely independent either. A larger transaction volume requires more security which in turn requires higher mining costs. Processing transactions worth a billion every day with mining costs of a million per year surly would be a pretty dumb idea.<p>It is of course a tough question to figure out how high the mining costs should be. Easier question, how would I attack Bitcoin. Assuming Bitcoin became mainstream and used as much as PayPal or even credit cards and I just want to cause havoc I would probably go for a DoS attack. Obtain the required hashing power and just fork the block chain again and again. I didn&#x27;t really think this through but just creating legitimate blocks with legitimate transactions but burying them in short side chain after short side chain so that they never get confirmed would be one of my first ideas. Probably way harder to mitigate then detecting blocks with few or useless transactions.<p>Do this for a couple of days and people will only want to get their money out as quick as possible. The Bitcoin price will crash in no time and people will lose a lot of money. Maybe you could even recapture some of your expenses by blackmailing people or betting on falling Bitcoin prices. But there are probably way more clever ideas then I can come up with ad hoc. Anyway, if mining costs are not high enough or in heavy disproportion to the transaction volume they protect bad things might happen. Back in the days of the cold war spending a billion Dollars on mining hardware to disrupt the Bitcoin based economy of the enemy would have been a real bargain.",1430867123

Jeffersons & Adams & Paine * Adam Smith are disproportionately represented among the people of that time that we remember now, but weren&#x27;t exactly the norm.<p>> Probably literacy reached a local maximum, or a higher level than in generations prior.<p>Well, the latter but not the former -- just as has been the case <i>since</i>. [0]<p>> To take this out of the broad country level perspective, where technological and other advancements and history could be argued to be the cause-- we could look at the second and third generation immigrants to the USA. I suspect, and I hear this anecdotally, but I don&#x27;t have data-- that the first generation kids are more industrious than the third or fourth<p>The common thing <i>I&#x27;ve</i> heard from people in fairly-recent-immigrant-descended-communities is that first-generation Americans (children of immigrants) are <i>less</i> industrious than immigrants <i>or</i> later generations. This is not to endorse the idea that any of these generational generalizations are accurate, just that, well, there&#x27;s lots of different generalized anecdotes out there.<p>> In fact, I would argue that it was the presumption that prosperity (Which we&#x27;ve had) would result in ever higher levels of literacy (Which we&#x27;ve experienced) and thus higher levels of enlightenment and philosophical perspective due to ever better education and schools -- which we have not had.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. I just think that due to selective preservation of history, we tend to only see the top end of the bell curve from 1776, and a lot more of the current distribution.<p>> Schools have slowly declined to the point where I suspect most schools don&#x27;t even teach classical literature, let alone philosophy.<p>Certainly, the fetishization of the ancients Greece and Rome has waned and there is a lot more literature written <i>since</i> the fall of Rome that is taught in schools. I&#x27;mnot sure that this is a problem. And the definition of &quot;philosophy&quot; has narrowed since the 18th Century -- much of what is currently taught in school <i>would have been</i> within the scope of &quot;philosophy&quot; were that term as broad as it was in the 18th Century.<p>And perhaps a smaller percentage of schools teach philosophy than did in the 18th Century, but I suspect at least as great a share of <i>people</i> attend schools in which philosophy is taught; that would have been mainly the elites in the 18th Century, after all, not everyone.

4845888,comment,4844417,4845821,1,0,dlitwak,,,"bullshit. I don't care how many primaries Romney won, 11 is a lot. And the fact that the one logical candidate in the race (as much as I dislike him), who was the least bit moderate, even evoked that ""anyone but Romney"" feeling only proves my point. The fact that people thought that crazy was better than Romney only proves my point.<p>And the fact that Romney had to tack so far to the right to even win the nomination proves my point yet again.<p>Look at polls: way too many Republicans believe stupid things like Obama is Muslim, he wasn't born in this country etc..<p>It's funny, I was going to bring up Mark Clayton as an example of a real outlier: the party completely ignored him (not this Akin stuff, Huckabee supported him, then the SuperPacs poured money in at the last minute when it had cooled down), it was in a state that Democrats have low turnout in since they have no chance of winning anyway, so an idiot managed to make himself the nominee. Every once in a while these things happen, yes, but over the past few years you guys have elected as your candidates Christine O'Donnell ('I'm not a witch'), the legion of legitimate rape morons, and a bunch of other memorable idiots like Bachmann who accused a Clinton staffer of being a highly placed Muslim Brotherhood operative.<p>You purge your party of anyone who says anything remotely conciliatory or logical/moderate.<p>If you were talking about one state rep, or even one senator, you would have a point. But the numerous crazies and the fact that you considered people like Bachmann and Santorum legitimate contenders for the presidency does not give you the right to call the crazies the ""outliers"" in your party: the inmates are now running the asylum.",1354154368

You are receiving services from Facebook and in return you are giving them your information. Facebook does not sell your information to anyone - instead they sell the ability to advertise to different groups of users (who you are one of). To say that you are the product implies that companies are getting ""you,"" but they are only getting ads displayed on Facebook. They do not have any idea about you or your specific information.<p>If you don't give Facebook information, it directly hurts Facebook. If you don't browse Facebook, it directly hurts Facebook. Their revenue absolutely depends on users enjoying their service.<p>Broadcast television uses a similar model, but no one accuses them of ""selling"" their users.",1354154177

I don't know what triggered it but honestly my heart rate literally increased when I saw you didn't have a single name, a single email address, no contact info at all on GetHelium. I've never been that passionately angry before over a website. Maybe I'm overly-obsessed and need a break from design. Maybe I lost my life-savings to a con artist in a former life, I don't know.<p>I signed up and was about to connect my Stripe account when I realized it. I felt like I was being played. Who were these guys? Are they for real? Can I trust them? I automatically assumed I could because their site's on HN and got upvoted. And a flood of hormones and emotions came in, I felt weak, powerless to judge, unable to trust, unable to ask, confused, angry. All such negative emotions caused by a website without contact info.<p>Contact info is my #1 pet peeve in all of designdom.<p>You don't even need a seperate about page, just a picture of you guys at the bottom in the footer, with your names and email addresses.<p>Credibility and trust is more important than Usability, Pricing, Design, and everything else. NOTHING is more important. That's why so many sites have pictures of the owner, its workers, testimonials, links to Tech Crunch and the New York Times articles about them. Anything to build trust and say, ""We're not going to run off with your money.""<p>- Bad design is forgivable, you might not have had the time or budget. Lots of sites with terrible design still get money and customers.<p>- Bad UI is also forgivable, you might have bad taste. Lots of websites with terrible and confusing UI still sell, solve problems, and make money.<p>- Hiding contact info while asking for money has no excuse. It's deceptive. It's something thieves do.

Hell, Lenovo has four different Windows 8 convertibles and tablets, and each of them are severely deficient in one way or another.<p>Most of the devices have only 1366x768 resolution. That's just not acceptable for $600+ products when the iPad is at 2048x1536 and the Nexus 10 is at 2560x1600 at $100 and $200 less, respectively.<p>Several of the convertible devices (Sony's Duo, Dell's XPS 12) have severely compromised battery life (4-5 hours). That's not acceptable when the iPad and Nexus 10 are at 8-10 hours at half the price.<p>In a bizarre product segmentation choice, the 1080p screens seem to be tied to the Ivy Bridge processors. Which means you can have iPad/Nexus-like readability or iPad/Nexus-like battery life, but not both in the same device.<p>I'm really looking hard at Windows 8 because I want to consolidate to a convertible-like device, and the iPad's lack of a mouse for Citrix remote log-in is a problem.

4845869,comment,4843429,4845534,2,0,taliesinb,,,"I think partly the reason is that the document model of notebooks is quite complicated. Each notebook is a hierarchy of Mathematica expressions (technically, the box versions of the original Mathematica expressions) and an associated set of cascading style sheets that tell the frontend how to format things. There are some nice advantages that stem from this meta-homoiconicity, but also some disadvantages.<p>One of these disadvantages is that editing the notebook does quite weird things to this hierarchy, like embedding new cells inside existing ones, merging cells, and changing mutable state in the frontend in various ways. Figuring out how to intelligently support multiple levels of undo without leading to rapid garbage generation and/or corruption is I imagine a Hard Problem.<p>For the record, another disadvantage is that source versioning and diffing is nigh on impossible (unless it takes place at a higher level, which is an interesting idea I think the company should pursue).",1354153831

With interest rates depressed & a stock market fairly valued, & that's not counting the immense wealth generated in other parts of the world by the commodity bubble. There are very few remaining outlets for productive capital. Say what you want about the valley now, it's still a great investment <i>destination/asset class</i>.<p>2- If the returns on the seed side start to dip. What would stop stop seed investors to graduate & become  (smaller) VCs. After all, Investing is their trade, they're not going anywhere.Slowly, by capillarity, Seed investors will become series A, Series A will rise to being series B...& so forth. With the 500 investor limit being lifted. Maybe IPOs are going to be pushed even further down the cycle..until profitability is established & business models flushed out.<p>3- Crowd-funding is only getting started.

(And even for those wins, Santorum needed the 'anybody but Romney' dynamic: it was far from broad GOP love for Santorum. Though if you're suffering from the out-group bias I mentioned, it might look that way.)<p>And yes, a major party's Senate candidate can be an 'outlier'.<p>In the US, the parties don't pick the candidates, voters do through primaries. Only 36% of Missouri Republican primary voters gave Akin a slim plurality in a no-runoff 3-way primary. Two other candidates in that primary, each with a broader base of national Republican support, got a combined 59% of the GOP vote. So Akin is even somewhat of an outlier in his home, conservative Missouri GOP.<p>An bigger outlier was the 'major party' Democratic Senate candidate in Tennessee, Mark Clayton:<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/2012s-worst-candidate-with-mark-clayton-tennessee-democrats-hit-bottom/2012/10/22/77da926e-1b8a-11e2-a146-ccabc9c85c53_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/2012s-wo...</a><p>Still, Clayton won the primary and got to run as the Democrat, over the protests of the state party, because that's how the system works. A plurality of voters who show up in low-turnout, often unrepresentative primaries pick the candidates, not the parties.<p>Yes, the GOP has lost a bunch of its moderate candidates, and that's a problem for the GOP and the country. The causes are both internal GOP malfunctions, and the portrayal-biases I've been mentioning from the media and casual poltical observers. (The moderates rarely get their due respect/coverage as equal Republicans, the Republicans don't get due recognition of their internal diversity. So the breadth of the party has decayed compared to the past, before year-round cable-news/internet politi-tainment narrowed and hardened the party identities.)",1354152519

Investors loved the large user bases and the crazy growth. Groupon loved the high margins and the ability to make the books look great.

You are reaching 20% of your orbital velocity without reaction mass.<p>Unfortunately, kinetic energy scales as speed squared, so 20% of your orbital speed represents less than 5% of your orbital kinetic energy.  To put this in perspective, the difference in gravitational potential energy between LEO and the earth's surface represents about 15% of your total on-orbit energy.<p>Now, it's true that an air-breathing engine doesn't need to carry reaction mass (and, sometimes, oxidizer), but the air engines add considerable complexity (which is always a bad thing) as well as weight (because you still need to carry a conventional rocket to finish orbit insertion).  So what you need to do is ask how the weight penalty of the air engine compares to the weight penalty of carrying extra fuel in a conventional rocket (bearing in mind, of course, that there a pernicious positive feedback loops when scaling a booster).",1354152115

4845751,comment,4844786,4845487,12,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>Apparently this theory's authors have also studied linguistics and multiple languages. So how do you counter their arguments regarding syntax and core vocabulary?</i><p>So far their publication on the contested point in discussion here is the press release submitted here. The field of linguistics has peer-reviewed journals like any other science, and it has authoritative secondary sources (surveys of world languages) and tertiary sources (encyclopedias of linguistics) and a large scholarly community of people who have more specialized knowledge than (apparently) any participant in this thread, including me, who know English, Old English, modern Scandinavian, Old Norse, and German well enough to dig into the data. What's more, historians have been publishing for generations on the general issue of how Britain was settled by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes after written history had already begun in Britain, and how incursions by ""Danes"" in Britain were responded to by the local populations. This is not a new field.<p>A new comment, more recently submitted than your reply to my comment, puts the issue well:<p><i>Having studied linguistics I'd say the claim is sensationalist rather than sensational. English is a rather wild crossbreed of many European languages, all of which share the same Indo-European roots.</i><p><i>Old English is very closely related to Old Frisian and Low German. Later on English has been heavily influenced by Scandinavian, Romance (mainly French due the Norman invasion in 1066 - Norman French to be specific, which differed quite a bit from le-de-France French at that time) and Gaelic languages to some extent.</i><p>That's very familiar to all of us who have formally studied linguistics of English. What's also dismaying familiar to anyone who has studied linguistics is the attempt of nationalists who are partisans of one language or another to claim a connection between their language and some language that enjoys great prestige (here, English). I have nothing against Norwegian. I speak it (a little), and Norwegian was my late grandmother's native language. I have nothing against German. I speak it (rather more than I speak Norwegian), and it was the native language and sole language of schooling for two of my grandparents. I also acknowledge, as I did in my original comment, that BOTH the North Germanic and West Germanic branches of Germanic languages influenced English. My uncontroversial and non-extraordinary claim here, agreed to by most linguists, is simply that the weight of influence on English is such, and the history of English is such, that English is better characterized as a West Germanic language than as a North Germanic language. The most frequently occurring word in English, which is ""the,"" is one demonstration of that. The word ""the"" is a West Germanic word.",1354151269

For the record, I use Mathematica too, and while I find it useful I'm more often that not left frustrated.<p>Clearly they've improved these features, they just haven't improved them enough for my uses. I've personally used the Units package before and made audio spectrograms, without much issue but without much success either. I always had to turn to other tools to get the result I need, and <i>this is still the case</i> with Mathematica 9. The improvements aren't sufficient to make Mathematica useful for my particular uses. Let's take face detection as an example:<p><a href=""http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/FindFaces.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/FindFaces.html</a><p>Do we know how it finds the faces? What if we want it to find other facial features, or train it with another data set? With OpenCV, I can tell it to use a custom Haar cascade. The only options Mathematica exposes are face size!<p>Having a feature in a bullet point isn't sufficient if the feature isn't fleshed-out enough to be useful.<p>More generally, I find myself using Matlab more often even though it doesn't work quite as well for my purposes. And why? Because it has easily readable source files, more in-depth documentation that tells you how its algorithms work, it has an open-source alternative that's more or less source-compatible (Octave; Matlab gives me a nice GUI and a pleasant working environment, but a colleague can run my files) and also uses open source software in a lot of cases so its output can be independently verified. It's that kind of thing that Mathematica needs to work on, not surface level features that probably aren't going to be useful for people who actually need them. If someone's project relies on good face detection I doubt very much they'd find FindFaces[] sufficient. Which is not to say Mathematica isn't better for having it than not having it at all, and I am sympathetic that they have to start somewhere...<p>Edit: I just want to add thatI have no doubt a lot of very smart people are working at Wolfram, and a lot of these features are great. I just can't help but think that developer effort is somewhat misplaced. The graph in the blog post of number of functions against time only goes to highlight that. When you see the number of people clamouring for undo support, or a better GUI, or existing features being better-explained or more fleshed out, I think that's what they should be concentrating on rather than adding new features to the list. Though the new Tensor functions are pretty cool..",1354151212

That means that the historically documented prolonged contact between Scandinavians and the English had some effect on the grammar. No surprise there.

4845724,comment,4844417,4845527,3,0,gojomo,,,"Well, that's Texas. (I grew up in northeast Houston.) These 'unappealing' candidates are reliably winning there, so it's hard to say they're not locally appropriate, on (small-d) democratic principles. And even the (big-D) Democrats are more conservative in such places, steering clear of gay/abortion rights. For example, you mention Mourdock in IN. He lost to a pro-life, anti-gay-marriage Democrat who'd co-sponsored a bill that included the same extra 'forcible' qualifier about rapes that GOPers are attacked about.<p>Also, all ""rape-comment scandals"" are not alike. (Fuzzing them  together is again deploying 'out-group homogeneity bias' for partisan electoral advantage.)  Mourdock's gaffe was clumsy, but a genuine attempt at expressing a philosophically consistent position, common among religiously-motivated abortion opponents, that follows naturally from the idea that <i>all</i> life is a supernatural gift, and <i>all</i> abortion an unjust taking of a life. (I've heard strongly pro-choice people say they respect this position, for its consistency, more than the 'convenient, popular exceptions' pro-life position.)<p>If Mourdock had said it more artfully -- for example keeping the words 'rape' and 'something god intended' much further apart -- many voters may still have disagreed with his 'no exceptions' approach but it would have been a lot harder to tarnish him with Akin-like ignorance and insensitivity. (Harder, but not impossible: more than ever before partisans and 'outrage farmers' selectively quote and rearrange statements to make them maximally-inflammatory before reporting, to score quick points before the full original context is known.)<p>Even your word choice that Mourdock ""found it necessary to mention"" this makes it seem like he was going out of his way to inflame. If you watch the clip yourself -- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgDgub8X6DQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgDgub8X6DQ</a> -- I think it's pretty clear he was struggling with a dicey issue (especially for those who believe in a 'good' and omnipotent diety who allows evil to happen), and trying to be responsive to a direct question during a debate.

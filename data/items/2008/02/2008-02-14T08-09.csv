Having both the skill to build something and the wisdom to know what to build in the mind of a single person is much stronger than having 'business people' and 'developers'. Also, YC is less concerned with developers in general; they pretty much have the pick of a self selected lot that's already pretty entrepreneurial, so adding a business person to the mix doesn't really tend to help all that much.",1202979594

He said that they are pretty thorough in their investigations of your marriage, especially if there are no kids.<p>If it were me in charge, the customs/immigration/etc folks would be the first ones up against the wall:-)",1202978417

That means that if their database gets breached all the passwords are exposed.   They should be storing a salted hash of the password.<p>Also, I don't agree that everyone uses the same password over and over.  They are nice bookmarklets that can generate per-site passwords.  I actually generate a new password for every site in my head.",1202977771
115670,comment,115599,115599,0,0,bfioca,,,"I'm going to lose karma points for this but I think this issue is really mostly just paranoia.  Can someone tell me what the likelihood is that someone would sniff my password from the bits traveling in the series of tubes from the server to whatever mail service I use is?  For the record, I've worked on an app that sent plaintext passwords because we thought it was useful to have a record of the password you used to register with us.  We changed it pretty fast when a few disproportionately loud complaints came in, and nobody asked for it back, and I totally feel like if it makes users more comfortable that it's a good thing, but I still can't bring myself to consider plain text passwords in email a big negative.  Anyone agree or am I alone? :)",1202977519

The RIM guy, for instance, sounds like an order of magnitude better engineer than some other people in the book.  Others definitely got lucky because they were in the right place in the right time, and were smart enough to take advantage of it.",1202977344

And I have a decent essay outlining the interface that I'll try and post here at some point.<p>Honestly, the closest thing I've seen to an interface that is what I wanted is the custom desktop environment on the EeePC. But it would need to be made rocksolid on a much bigger monitor for the market I intended.<p>My YC app was after YouOS was funded. If I was the CEO of YouOS, I would use their tech to make a product for the older computer user market. But I'm not the CEO of YouOS. The round I was rejected from was the one Blake Ross was admitted to for an idea similar to mine with a much more impressive sounding client/server technology. I don't think that helped my odds either.",1202977222
115667,comment,115590,115640,0,0,DaniFong,,,"The sham marriage is technically illegal, and vaguely dangerous. Though in fact it is indeed a common occurrence. You can, however, get a TN visa for part-time work, that is completely allowed. Also, the letter of the law seems to indicate that you're allowed to get a TN visa for a company you own partially, provided you don't have a controlling share (i'm not sure if this holds up in court, though). If it does, (i'd talk to an immigration lawyer to make sure), find three other Canadians, split a company equally, and nominate each others visas.",1202977135

Bear in mind that this is all a little shady and really the only other way without an in (fake wife/employer) is through the presumably arduous process of just straight up applying for citizenship.

115662,comment,114982,115147,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"<i>Because of California's settled public policy in favor of competition, it is questionable whether any covenant not to compete which restrains a partner, member or director from engaging in a competing business that is not expressly authorized by statute or designed to protect a trade secret will be held enforceable in California. Moreover, because of this strong public policy, it is unlikely that a California court will apply the law of another state in interpreting a covenant not to compete based upon a contractual provision or the internal affairs doctrine. Therefore, caution must be exercised in California whenever attempting to limit a partner, member or director from entering into a competing business through a contract.</i><p><a href=""http://www.pircher.com/resources/article.php?i=329"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pircher.com/resources/article.php?i=329</a>",1202976053

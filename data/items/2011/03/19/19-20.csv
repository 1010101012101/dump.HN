2344529,comment,2343330,2343707,0,0,ashearer,,,"The key isn't so much that the configuration language is the source code language, but that both are a template language. As far as the parser is concerned all three are written interchangeably in an HTML superset that's sent down the wire raw by default, no matter where they're located or what called them. PHP gains its low barrier to entry partly from the fact that HTML becomes valid PHP just by changing its extension, but that useful equivalence also cuts the other way.<p>Many other frameworks use the source code language for configuration without risking this particular error, because they keep templates separate. (In Django, for example, templates use a different language and are read out of template-specific directories.)<p>It's not even a problem unique to configuration files. A disclosure of source code would have occurred by replacing the first character of a PHP source file. The fact a configuration file was involved makes the effect both more severe and less likely to be caught ahead of time. More severe, because it discloses passwords, rather than just proprietary code. Less likely to be caught, because standard testing methods tend to rely on a staging or test config instead of the production one.<p>There are other posts disagreeing over various single villains, but a wider view is that Tumblr was bitten by a combination of a single-character typo, an otherwise useful PHP language design choice, the common and otherwise harmless practice of configuring via a programming language, and the blind spot typical test suites have for production-specific issues.",1300564492

2344527,comment,2343296,2344370,0,0,jdp23,,,"Good points although I'm not sure the technology basis is at the heart of it.  Bloggers are equally bad about linking to primary sources.  Back in 2008 I traced several stories from the first reports via the tech and politics blogospheres to the mainstream media, and in almost all the cases the primary sources had vanished a couple of articles into the chain.  X writes something on NewsVine; Y writes about it in Wired (linking to X) and then it gets on Slashdot or Reddit or HN; Z writes about it in the New York Times -- and links to Y, but not X.<p>Agreed that time is a lot of it, but it's also a matter of how people want their articles to look.  What's more important, linking to the original source or buttressing the story's credibility by highlighting that it's reported in Wired?  Both!  But it takes a lot of work to craft a sentence that reads smoothly and allows you to link to both stories (and even then it may be very hard to fit in the authors' names) and very few authors consistently make the effort.",1300564477

But I can tell you the one thing I see most often when I am looking around is that almost everyone hiring is looking for a 4 year degree (since I am a dropout maybe thats why I usually dont look/apply for jobs) but if you have finished your degree I am sure you'll do fine.<p>Personally I was not even going to school for programming I started doing it in middle school for a hobby and it progressed from there, I sold a software company in my junior year of college and never looked back, even still I am not sure many companies would hire me because of my lack of a degree, so that is something else to consider as well.<p>I dont think you should at all feel selfish for considering your future or desiring to be able to save money again, at the end of the day if you are not happy you are not putting your all into the product and the MVP probably will never be as good today as it would have been if you had put it out 3 years ago with a fresher vision and lots of drive.<p>I'd say to follow your gut, seems to me most peoples first instinct is almost always their best.<p>Good luck with everything!",1300564350

I run a website where we have a minimum age of 16 y/o required in our TOS in order to use the site, so invoking COPPA wouldn't necessarily work. We've been wanting to deal with users who fall under this minimum in a tactful way for a while now, since we've noticed a correlation between these users and problematic behavior[1] on site. The problem is that our existence as a site/company has been predicated (in part) on transparency and being nice guys; I feel it would be, for lack of a better term, a ""dick move"" to suddenly notify users and remove accounts now that we've finally decided that we really need to clean things up, but on the other hand, it's something I really feel we need to do for the health of the site. We also are torn as to whether to grandfather in users falling below the threshold who've exhibited good behavior, or just deal with everyone irrespective of history. My primary concern is potential backlash from users (both those being removed <i>and</i> observers of this) in that it makes us look evil, even though at the end of the day, it's a violation of our TOS, plain and simple, and we <i>could</i> remove any account for any/no reason at any time.<p>So, I ask: what would you do in this situation?<p>[1] problematic in that it creates tension for other users, but does not technically break any laws/rules",1300564057

If you can figure out what your mix of ""doing"" energy is and consciously direct it into productive outlets, rather than frittering it away for personal satisfaction, you will get more done.<p>Concrete personal example:  I like writing but probably spend too much time frittering that interest away posting on forums like this one rather than developing my websites.  That's in part due to my health:  It is far easier to respond to something someone has said than to write up something from scratch without having something to respond to.  When healthier, I am more able to do the kind of writing that I want on my websites. (In fact, my first website started while I was quite ill was basically an edited collection of emails of mine or excerpts from emails.)  I have left a number of lists related to the topics of my websites, in part because I am so controversial in certain circles and in part because I felt that I need to put my energy into developing my websites rather than trying to chit chat with people on email lists.  Chit-chatting with people on email lists <i>feels</i> very productive to me but it's not that productive.  There is a ""live"" audience that can respond and interact with me and I just feel like I am doing so much more than I really am because of the responses.  This is a personal issue that I am aware of and have been trying to work on for some time.  I recently unsubbed from a health list in large part so I can move on to doing more productive kinds of writing about health issues.<p>As for ""dysfunctional perfectionism"":  After nearly dying and finally getting a serious diagnosis late in life, I promptly returned to college while still very ill with the attitude ""A sick person like me needs to make more B's if I am ever going to get a degree.""  I've also done volunteer work at a homeless shelter and went down in flames horribly in various online forums while publicly withdrawing from all kinds of prescription medication.  I'm a lot thicker skinned than I used to be and much more okay with failure as a productive means to learn what not to do, what my limits are and so on.<p>Good luck with this.",1300563705

I'm looking for more of an intuition, problem solving ability, and the ability to cleanly translate the solution into code.""<p>No, they can't be easily learned by people fresh out of college. I'm 31 and have been doing this stuff since I was a teenager. It takes years of hard won experience to really know the ins and outs all the various facets of frontend engineering. This particular sub-field isn't one programming language. It's knowing what html, css, and javascript do across at least 11 different browser platforms. It's knowing what kinds of interfaces work for different devices. It's knowing javascript as a true language and not a copy/paste thing. It's being able to know know to translate a 2 dimensional design into the correct underlying structure, in real-time.<p>So that's just my answer to your ""any good programmer"" statement. That just means you don't really know what you actually need to be hiring for.<p>I agree 100% about being about to get along with people. But problem solving is directly related to the field you're in. Ask a programmer to be a heart surgeon, I'm sure any smart programmer can easily learn those skills. The intuition will be there if the interview is about what the person should know.<p>Suppose your database queries are running extremely long and slow because you're a startup and you and your cofounder are generalists. Your company starts getting traction and now that database is becoming a problem. You're a frontend dev that knows python, and your partner is more of a biz guy that does some coding. Now you both identify that you need someone who really knows how to scale databases. Do you ask candidates random CS questions to see if they have some ill-defined ""intuition"", or do you find out if they know how to scale databases?<p>It's no different for frontend engineers.<p>I also agree about the coding part. But you have to do it in the context of the requirements. For a frontend, look at their previous work. Identify some area of your own product that you think can be improved, or was improved. Have the frontend candidate work through how they would improve the js/HTML/CSS etc. This should involve coding, and the person interviewing should have at least enough base knowledge themselves to know if the candidate is worth their salt or not.",1300563180

To be clear, the ZIL can (and should be) mirrored, you just want to do it with SSDs consistently. Mixing devices is possible, but you'll be limited to the performance of the slowest device. You can also create storage clusters with multiple heads. Again, a good idea IMO, but the ZIL is a critical component of the FS. If you lose it, you lose the whole pool (as a rule I think, but there might be clever hacks around that under special circumstances if you're lucky).

I permute through the candidates, and then run a scoring function. I perform greedy hill climbing , and return the DAG with the best score.<p>Since this is Clojure, and my DAG is build from Clojure's persistent data structures, iterating through all possible dags is easy. Clojure's ""update"" functions return new structs that share structure with the original, both the original structure and the new one exist at the same time. If I were using mutable data structures, I'd either have to deep copy a new DAG (slower), or write ""rollback"" code (buggy).<p>Additionally, because the Clojure data structures are purely functional, and Clojure includes tools for multi-threaded synchronization, parallelizing this algorithm is trivial.<p>A separate example: \nI have an existing function that can take several minutes to an hour to run. I wanted to add a button to the web UI that says ""go run the function"". Of course, you don't want multiple versions running at the same time, so you need to queue up the function call, and you don't want the user to queue up 5 calls when they only need 1. It took all of about 4 lines of clojure to make the function run in a separate thread and handle all of the above issues, and I'm guaranteed to never have multithreading bugs in that code.<p>In summary<p>* purely functional data structures greatly simply multi-threaded programming, and make some algorithms easier to write.<p>* Clojure is designed from the ground up to make multi-threading easy and painless. Many multi-threading tools are built into the language, and you don't have to deal with locking and deadlock unless you drop into the Java synchronization primitives.",1300562208

Even if it's just for a day.  These are resources that have been there, done that, and wouldn't be interested in a full-time gig with the company to begin with.  Even if the company could afford them.<p>Hopefully this isn't too far off topic, but it's something that I see missing from a lot of clients that I get called into.  (Not saying these guys haven't done this, either.)<p>I think there's a lot of value for a startup to validate their work with outside help, especially if they're relatively new to the game.  Even if it's just pointing them to some articles or reading for them to follow up on, or just mentioning ideas of things they should look into; it can prove to be huge.<p>For instance, I'm currently mentoring a few developers/teams on a part-time, couple hours a week basis.  Some of it is just being available on MSN to answer a quick question every now and then, other times it's doing a couple code reviews.  Other times it's grabbing lunch/beer with them to discuss the concepts of things like how to implement continuous integrated testing, or managing other processes, or discussing new tech that they've heard of.  For the most part, they're not paid gigs either.  I enjoy helping people do stuff well, and the little bit of good faith help usually leads to some good future work.<p>Sometimes all it takes is asking the right question to get them to think about things in a different manner.<p>The last gig I got was for a major video game company.  The job involved a .NET stack, which I knew nothing about and had never worked with, not even a little bit.  I got the job despite that fact because in the interview I asked them general (admiteddly leading) questions, such as ""how are you handling _____, or what is your plan for _____"".  Even though all of my experience had been in non-MS tech stacks, the technical director that was interviewing me was furiously taking notes.  It was clear that they hadn't planned for some of the things I was mentioning, never mind thought of them.  But once they heard the question, it was painfully obvious they should have.  As a result, a 3-day consulting engagement turned into full-time for two years.<p>In my case right now, I've sought a mentor in some new tech I'm working with in my current startup.  It's allowed me to hit the ground running, and take advantage of their experience.  A half day one-on-one made all the difference for me, and will drastically improve the quality of what I'm doing.",1300561932

They erred in not understanding that the program was written years ago and not intended for that use.  Of course, then it is not the error of the human who wrote the program.<p>This, however, is the reason why the phrase ""human error"" is mainly applied to simple, 'random' mistakes such as typos, fat-fingering a button, or misfiling a paper - errors that anyone can make, simply by being a forgetful human - rather than the literal meaning of ""any error committed by a human"".  Stretched to cover every mistake made by a homo sapiens, the phrase loses all descriptive power.<p>So, to clarify - all errors made by humans are ""human error"" in some sense, but that renders the classification meaningless, so we should distinguish between simple, common errors and more worrisome ones by using words other than ""human error"".  Your example of a programmer that did not foresee a future desired use could be referred to as a ""requirements error"" if the programmer reasonably could have or should have foreseen it, as ""operator error"" if the person using the program is meant to be trained to understand its proper uses, or a ""misallocation of resources error"" if the problem exists because not enough budget or time was assigned to keep the program aligned with current necessary uses.<p>I sometimes feel that a fair number of disagreements or disputes in the comments of Hacker News are best resolved by checking whether we are using words in exactly the best way.",1300561241

[Actually, I'm not sure about that. I know that <i>either</i> it's not well-defined, or its definition is something that's clearly not what we want in this situation.]<p>So let's ask something that we can actually reason about, like, ""Assuming infinite memory, roughly how many floating point operations per second would a computer need to be able to execute in order to direct a human body in a way that's indistinguishable from what a real person does -- in real time?""<p>And, okay, we really only want the brain's conscious thought and maybe some of its unconscious thought, but it's hard to make a well-defined question involving just those things, and I doubt that the answer to our question will be more than a few orders of magnitude off of what we're really after.<p>- - -<p>Anyway, your post does a really, really bad job of answering that question (or anything like it). Your worst offense:\n> ""So the human brain has about 10^11 neurons and about 10^4 synapses per neuron. Naively representing the state of each synapse with one byte requires 10^15 bytes that's about 500,000 PCs.""<p>Come on. Did the fact that you had to use the word ""byte"" not tip you off? YOU'RE DISCUSSING MEMORY. Nobody cares about memory, because the amount of memory needed to store the brain's state is <i>vastly</i> less than the number of operations needed to simulate its function in real time.<p>I seriously am not able to articulate how frustrated I am that at least 12 people felt justified in upvoting you without taking the time to process the first two sentences of your post.<p>Before I go, another treat:\n> ""Electronics are potentially a factor of 10^8 faster.""<p>No. Electronics <i>are</i> a factor of 10^8 ""faster"", when ""faster"" is taken to mean ""more rapid in executing a cycle."" Which is an absolutely pointless irrelevent piece of shit statistic.<p>What the fuck.<p>- - -<p>Anyway, let me wrap up this post by actually answering the above question as best we can, given the current state of scientific understanding (or, more precisely, my understanding of that state of understanding):<p>There are on the order of 10^10 neurons and on the order of 10^11 glial cells in the adult human brain. These cells are directed by untold numbers of chemoattractants. We have no good theoretical model for the behavior of these cells in huge numbers of situations.<p>Therefore, WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO FUCKING IDEA how much processing power it would take to simulate the brain's macro function. We can put an upper bound on it: we know that if we could simulate every atom in the brain to a reasonable degree of accuracy, we'd get human behavior. Obviously the number of FLOPS it would take to do such a thing is unreachable. And beyond that, I don't think it's fair to say we know anything at all.",1233991884

I just did a Google search for one (under ""Abolish grades in universities"" and didn’t come up with any such organization.  So obviously the people who have been trying for years aren’t trying all that hard.<p>Surely there has to be some distinction between trying to fix the system and simply deciding to ignore it.  I think to a certain extent you’re projecting in that, though I still disagree with you, you’ve at least thought this issue out.  I’m not sure you can say that about this professor (he didn’t seem to give an intelligent counter argument in the article)<p>Second, and somewhat related to the first, the one thing no one’s answered here is how this professor’s actions are going to change anything.  Saying he’s trying to fix the system is contingent on his actions following some kind of logical progression that leads to a changing of the system?  From what I can see his tactless approach has done more harm than good (since any teacher who agreed with him would now have to fear suspension).

Of course you would prefer verified, non-anonymous accounts.  If someone put a cell phone video of BART police shooting someone, you might allow that to be anonymous because the video seems hard to fake.  I'm sure you would run into many journalistic and ethical questions.<p>The site would be best for the kind of person who would never have his own website, blog, or write a book, but happened to witness some interesting event in history.  For example I have a cousin who was a volunteer fireman and helped search attics and recover bodies in New Orleans after the Katrina.  He may never write his autobiography, but those stories in particular ought to be recorded somewhere.<p>The hard part is the chicken-and-egg part of getting the project started.

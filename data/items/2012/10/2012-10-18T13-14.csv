Mankind (and our pets) did not evolve to live the lifestyle we're living. Sitting at a computer all day, driving home, then sitting at a TV all night. Changing diet is fine and it works well for some. Others might not have such as easy time of it.<p>I don't know what the solution to the problem is. But if you do, you will be rich.

4668735,comment,4668330,4668629,2,0,exDM69,,,"> Actually it makes sense, if you manually force the code to use only 4 threads it will take more time to finish that in the case when you let the compiler split the work for you.<p>While I think this is correct, I think your reasoning is off. And as far as I know, the compiler does not do anything clever here (unlike in some smarter, less mainstream languages) and you're just launching a huge number of threads.<p>If you use only 4 threads in a similar manner in a loop, the problem is that the background threads finish and the CPU is idle while the serial loop that creates the threads is occupied by creating and launching the threads and there are not enough threads to keep the cpu busy. (edit: this is more likely about waiting for I/O, see below).<p>If you're truly CPU bound, you will not gain from having a lot more threads than CPU cores (* ~1.5 for hyperthreads). If your threads are waiting for I/O, adding more will cause the OS to switch to an available thread but you gain more by using asynchronous I/O functions (like aio and epoll or kqueue, which you won't find an abstraction for in C++ stdlib). The way the code in the blog works is actually spending a whole lot of good cpu cycles for doing context switching from one thread to another and wasting a lot of memory for maintaining threads that wait for disk I/O.<p>What you can't see from the tutorial source is what the worker actually does (make_perlin_noise), I assume that function also does the writing to disk which would explain why you benefit from launching a huge number of threads. On the other hand, your memory use is completely unacceptable with this solution.<p>You should try this: split the number of images evenly and make each thread compute a number of images. Launch roughly as many threads as there are cpu cores and do not make the threads wait for disk I/O. You should see performance go up and memory use go down.",1350568447

For maximum CPU utilization and computational efficiency, you need multiple software threads per hardware thread so that the OS always has a thread ready to go when another thread blocks or the CPU has an unused component.  How much the threads block and what parts of the CPU the exercise is the workload-dependent part.  Ideally, the number of threads would be a tunable performance parameter.<p>As an example of this, I recently wrote some math-heavy code to transform the cells of a matrix by a particular transfer function.  Each cell calculation was independent, so I parallelized them.  The most efficient parallelization for my 6-core AMD processor turned out to be 6 threads per core.<p>[1] The main exception I can think of is when running multiple applications in parallel that in turn parallelize their work.",1350568054

4668652,comment,4668071,4668071,1,0,jj00nathan,,,"I disagree with OP. I think the phrase ""rocket science"" is still valid as a stand-in for the performance of a complicated task with high accuracy. In terms of the effort required to create a useful prediction, I agree that many things are more complicated than rocket science (often by virtue of being intractable). However, in almost all of these things success is not as highly correlated with the performance of some mental/engineering feat. If a rocket correctly performs a non-trivial task (i.e. gets to a specific orbit/planet/location), we know with certainty that the rocket scientist created a valid physical model and performed difficult calculations on it with high accuracy (ditto for other parts of the engineering). Testing rockets is expensive and the likelihood of making one that works by trial-and-error is zero (I'm referring to rockets on the scale that put satellites into orbit, launch probes thorough the solar system, etc). In comparison, common wisdom holds that startups usually launch with poor product/market fit and pivot until they find something that works. Eventual success doesn't correspond nearly as well to the performance of mental acrobatics.<p>Don't get me wrong, both tasks are difficult, require ""guts"", and so on. But I think a direct comparison of the difficulty is disingenuous. To me, ""This isn't rocket science"" doesn't mean ""this is easy"", it means ""we should be able to eventually succeed  by trial&error"".<p>@pja: your observation that ""not rocket science"" only became popular in the 90s jibes well with associating ""rocket science"" with ""low margin for error"", as challenger exploded in 1986.",1350567383

Take for example: the decision-maker who signs the deal and writes the check never actually uses the product, instead has staff which does so.  Differentiating the customer from the user is very important in this context: you have to make and keep both happy.  The customer will consider net impact to bottom line, high-level capabilities generally present in the market place, and the general temperature of the users before buying.  They will expect that you have a certain list of capabilities which everyone else is selling them, even if their users will hardly, if ever, use that feature.  The day-to-day users of the product, however, will have less abstract problems - they have real tasks to achieve every day, and will care much more about the specific capabilities and how they're implemented.<p>Sure, we could call them ""decision-making"" customer and ""product-using"" customer, but semantics driving psychology work the other way around as well : sales is customer-driven, and development and support are user-driven.

A home-made SRM is a more powerful version of fireworks SRMs, and then there's a thin line between home-made SRM design and things you could stack on car or helicopter to fire at things. Not every rocket is a space rocket, and depending on size and cost tradeoffs required, you get more and more complicated designs, creating a spectrum from a home-made 1km rocket to Falcon 9 & stuff.<p>I'd say that the real problem with rockets is not that they're inherently magical/difficult, but dangerous and costly to develop. We can say a lot about great engineering that went into things like fuel, nozzles, fins, etc. etd. but the same if not more engineering went into internal combustion engines, and I don't see people saying ""it's combustion engine science"".",1350567296

EDIT (adding context): the article says about the use-case for Juju ""configuring and setting up complex services with lots of application components can still be a bit tricky""... then goes on to give a basic LAMP WordPress setup... the thing is that a LAMP WP setup is neither complex nor it has lots of components, it's basically the ""drop dead simplest"" case of web app deployment, so they are clearly missing the point using this as an example :|",1350565570

He initially pointed me to a ""minimally obfuscated"" version to analyze. I'd say it took me a good hour or so to feel like I had a pretty good understanding of its workings, and even then I still wasn't clear on some details of the I/O model and a couple other things.<p>Most of the evolution from that point was finding ways to reduce the code size, then finally reformatting into a lambda. I credit John for not succumbing to gratuitous obfuscation, nor gratuitous use of macros to shave bytes. I suggested to him at one point to consider reducing the entire program to a single loop. He didn't think it would be shorter and pointed out that he had made a similar transformation in an earlier IOCCC entry of his, his infamous maze program, so I believed him and didn't go through the effort to verify for myself.",1350565516

The most important difference between a problems such as solving religious extremism and putting a satellite in orbit (or nuclear fusion or brain surgery) is that in the latter case you can isolate affecting factors and study them in (relative) isolation and sub-problems are well-defined and have well-defined answers, at least compared to social problems.",1350565261

A big public case study.<p>These are products that a lot of people are highly engaged an opinionated about, in ways that PCs and laptop never were.^<p>I think we clearly see Apple leading the way (so far) with its designs & innovations. They figured out a whole lot of things that needed to be figured out in order to get a computer to pocket size and for tablet computing to work. Some of these are technical details but a lot of them are not. They're just ideas about what it should look like and how users should interact with it. Software keyboard. slide-to-unlock, rounded corners. A bunch of decisions that together amount to either a good or bad product. They may or may not have been invented at Apple but Apple did put them together and prove them in the market. They placed huge bets on these ideas and won.<p>I think that last part is the crucial part of innovation that IP laws are inherently useless at protecting: Putting things together to make a product and proving them in the market.  It's also the part that Apple is good at.<p>On the other hand...<p>Apple is making a lot of money on iOS stuff so its hard to make the claim that they haven't been compensated. It's also hard to claim that these innovations would not have happened without the incentives guarded by IP protection. The opposite is true. We see the Android ecosystem driving down prices and improving the pace of innovation. We see more choice, including options at lower price points that Apple would never have served.<p>^I'm not sure, but I think this in itself is part of Apple's cultural influence. They've been encouraging people to think about products the way architects want people to think about buildings.",1350565256

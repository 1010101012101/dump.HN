After the injuries were treated, the \n  animals were gradually warmed up as the solution was \n  replaced with blood.\n\n  Surgeons are now on call at the UPMC Presbyterian \n  Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to perform the \n  operation. Because the trial will happen during a \n  medical emergency, neither the patient nor their family \n  can give consent. A final meeting this week will ensure \n  that a team of doctors is fully prepared to try it. Then \n  all they have to do is wait for the right patient to \n  arrive. When this happens, every member of Tisherman&#x27;s \n  team will be paged.\n\n  The technique will be tested on 10 people, and the \n  outcome compared with another 10 who met the criteria \n  but who weren&#x27;t treated this way because the team wasn&#x27;t \n  on hand. The technique will be refined then tested on \n  another 10, says Tisherman, until there are enough \n  results to analyse.\n\n  &quot;...we don&#x27;t like to call it suspended animation because \n   it sounds like science fiction...&quot; \n\n  says Samuel Tisherman, a surgeon at the hospital, who is \n  leading the trial.\n\n  &quot;After we did those experiments, the definition of &#x27;dead&#x27;\n   changed, Every day at work I declare people dead. They \n   have no signs of life, no heartbeat, no brain activity. \n   I sign a piece of paper knowing in my heart that they \n   are not actually dead. I could, right then and there, \n   suspend them. But I have to put them in a body bag. \n   It&#x27;s frustrating to know there&#x27;s a solution.&quot;\n\n  says surgeon Peter Rhee at the University of Arizona in \n  Tucson, who helped develop the technique.\n</code></pre>\nThe suspense is <i>KILLING</i> me!</pun>",1395885440

I think figuring out how to avoid that kind of complexity is one of they key challenges of certain kinds of software these days.<p>(For instance, some people think Rails has already jumped that shark, some people don&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m not sure even the people who think it has become complectified all agree on when it happened and how it could have been avoided. When I see people starting something new that&#x27;s supposed to be &quot;like Rails, but without all that needless complexity&quot;, I just think, sure, Rails started out simpler than today&#x27;s Rails too, and you&#x27;ll end up in the same place (or worse) unless you can come up with an understanding of what went wrong other than &quot;Those other people made bad decisions I would never have made because I&#x27;m a better coder&quot;, nope, that&#x27;s not what happened.).",1395884638

The following are my opinions and experiences and shouldn&#x27;t be viewed as an authority. Different PhDs, different specialties and different universities will result in different experiences and outcomes.<p>A PhD is simply a ticket that gives its holder an opportunity to move into fields (academia typically) that are not available to the general public. Some industries value PhDs higher than others. You&#x27;ll never get anywhere in the medical industry without appropriate qualifications whereas in the IT industry experience can often hold more weight than certificates.<p>People will also claim that a PhD gives you the opportunity to concentrate your entire focus on one particular topic for an extended period of time with great freedom. Sadly this isn&#x27;t always the case. The pressures to publish, whether from yourself or from your supervisors who are relying on you to assist their careers, often means the &#x27;independence&#x27; of a PhD becomes the &#x27;dependence&#x27; on completing your supervisors work.<p>That being said, completing a PhD gives you the confidence to assert yourself as an expert in a particular field and requires you to have a great depth of understanding in a very niche topic. Often the greatest reward of a PhD is knowing you&#x27;ve expanded humanities understanding of a particular topic by a tiny amount, and in doing so have contributed to the great growing expanse of knowledge.<p>I was told at the start of my PhD that if i didn&#x27;t love research I would never finish. I don&#x27;t love research. I hate the politics, the failures, the bureaucracy, the poor funding and incessant grant applications and the terrible working conditions and hours. However, I love discovery and probing the unknown. Anyone can do a PhD in my opinion but I don&#x27;t think everyone should and while I enjoyed my experience I wouldn&#x27;t repeat it.<p>Again though, my experience would probably be far removed from someone who did a PhD in computer science or history.",1395884072

That project makes me hopeful for the future. Anyone can install and use it, no matter what distribution or package manager is used on their system. Their default repositories are rather large, although obviously not as large as others, but that&#x27;s improving rather fast.<p>Beyond that, the fact that both KDE (Apper) and GNOME (Software) agree on using PackageKit by default, which grants them an app store that isn&#x27;t tied to a specific package management system, is rather good news for the future.",1395883513

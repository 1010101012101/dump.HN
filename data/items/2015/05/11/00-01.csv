Then I will do a clean install, disable all the crap, and only then connect the external drive that contains all my files.<p>Most people, though, will not be so cautious. If something is enabled by default, 99.9% of users will just keep it enabled, even if it&#x27;s possible to disable it. After all, that&#x27;s the whole point of enabling something by default.",1431305940

Jason Scott puts a lot of effort into preserving that sort of thing, and would probably be happy to sell cheap media through the mail with content on it.<p>The way I&#x27;d see it, there&#x27;d probably be a few networks. There&#x27;s obviously a lot more wireless devices capable of ad-hoc transmission then before the internet was popular, so there&#x27;d likely be some sort of meshnet-esque way of communicating.<p>There&#x27;d probably be a lot of inventive ways of using the phone network as well. For data, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;d be a lot of study into powerful compression and modulation techniques (you&#x27;d be surprised how much you can cram into an 8 khz PCM channel), but also some pretty extensive use of conference calls. Not like, the shareholder meeting type, but semi-commonly, you&#x27;ll see people use conferences just to joke around with each other, and collaborate on things; there&#x27;d probably be a good deal more of that.<p>What network someone picks would probably depend on their personal values and social circles, but just from observing Reddit, I feel like there&#x27;d be a lot of people who might feel like a fish out of water without internet - particularly among younger age groups.  It&#x27;s likely there&#x27;d be walled gardens set up by companies looking to capitalize on people feeling lost.<p>Ultimately though, people are resourceful. As a species, we&#x27;ve survived through a lot worse then a lack of internet access. For what we lack in physical literature, there&#x27;s bound to be someone ambitious/smart enough to either reverse engineer something in place or come up with a new solution to their problems.

There are other colleges too -- University of Warsaw is a very popular recruitment ground for big tech companies like Google even though it&#x27;s not on the same level as a top US school for research. University of Waterloo and Brown are a couple of others that come to mind that are popular with recruiters to a bigger extent than their rankings would indicate.

I do it from Japan (and work very strange hours so that I can work with others in the UK).  Working remotely is a skill in itself.  If you are interested in influencing process (and it seems that you are), then I would recommend staying away from remoting unless the rest of the team is also remote.  If you can go with the flow and just write code no matter which way the process goes, then remote development may be for you.  The main problem with influencing others remotely is that you don&#x27;t end up in the right conversations at the right time.<p>If you try to get someone to sponsor a visa for you, the main issue is: are you good enough?  The rules for sponsoring visas depends on the country, but as there is a world wide shortage of good programmers, you are likely to find <i>someone</i> willing to hire you (especially if you aren&#x27;t picky about where you go).  As others have said, English is the language used generally, but if you wrote the above yourself, then I think your English is probably fine.<p>You should consider whether or not <i>someone</i> hiring you is good enough for you.  Although I don&#x27;t know exactly what is causing your problem in your current job, &quot;I feel like I&#x27;m at a dead end because we do thing in a crappy way and nobody will listen to me&quot; is a <i>very</i> common situation in many companies.<p>Assuming you want to &quot;do thing right&quot; (according to your own definition of &quot;right&quot;), it means you have to be a bit more picky about where you work.  Your main hurdle is to show that you have skills that they couldn&#x27;t find in their home market.<p>As you mentioned JS, here&#x27;s the kind of thing that I mean:<p>Level 1: I can write basic front end code that uses jQuery to get things done.  I have written a few functions on my own, but mostly copy and paste things from Stack Overflow.<p>Level 2: I can write dynamic front end web applications using one or more frameworks.  I can use these frameworks fluently, but rarely go outside of them.<p>Level 3: I write code in JS.  If you want, I will use whatever framework you want, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.  I&#x27;m familiar with many styles of programming and can use testing frameworks like Jasmine well.<p>Level 4:  I&#x27;m an expert in JS.  I routinely contribute bug fixes, and features to various libraries.  I write blog posts about how to write better JS applications.<p>Level 5: I am an internationally renown expert in JS.  I maintain one of the really popular frameworks, or I have written books that are popular on the topic.<p>Basically, I can find thousands of JS &quot;programmers&quot; in the Level 1 category.  I don&#x27;t want them, even if they are cheap.<p>We get hundreds of CVs from local people in the Level 2 category.  We might consider a local person for a junior position, but would definitely not go out of our way to bring in someone at that level.<p>Level 3 starts to become interesting and we would probably interview someone who needs a visa.  At this level, though, you have to convince us that you are super talented to make us want to go through the effort and cost of sponsoring you.<p>At level 4, you are demonstrating that you have rare skills and initiative.  Although personally I think it&#x27;s actually a fairly low bar to hit, the number of people who do this kind of thing is really very small.  It&#x27;s nice because we can evaluate your skills to a certain degree before trying to hire you.<p>At level 5, it is trivial for us to sponsor a visa.  We still might not hire you if we think you aren&#x27;t actually a good fit for our team, but I pretty much guarantee that we would eagerly interview you.<p>Of course there are many more things we consider when hiring people, the above is really just the kind of thing we look at with respect to sponsoring a visa.  We just can&#x27;t justify to ourselves or the government that we couldn&#x27;t find someone locally unless there is something obviously special about you.<p>Having said that, you may notice that putting yourself in a Level 4 or even Level 5 position is not something that is outside of your control.  Working in a &quot;dead end&quot; job while you spend your time making yourself more marketable to a worldwide audience is probably not the worst thing you could do in the world.<p>I hope this helps :-)",1431303300

9521993,comment,9520984,9521895,0,0,angersock,,,"rogerhoward makes some excellent points.<p>Some other things, assuming for the sake of discussion that this writeup is accurate:<p>1. It damages the relationship of the jackboot community and the administration: the SEALs were deployed to hit Bin Laden, and were told that this would be done without fanfare. Instead, within hours, the White House and company are bragging about the whole operation. This is not how proper clandestine things are done, one imagines.<p>2. It damages the relationship of the jackboots in particular and the administration: having to suffer the indignity of signing what is a effectively an NDA for premeditated murder--and then watching two folks get away with breaching it because it supports the new, official story--cannot have been easy for the folks involved in the raid.<p>3. It damages the State department&#x27;s credibility (hah) with Pakistan. We agreed that steps would be taken to reinforce the government&#x27;s position with its people, and that we wouldn&#x27;t implicate them--they would save face. Instead, we put up a flimsy half-baked cover story, and decide not to go with one that leads to lots of easy questions, which will never have answers that are either convenient or satisfying. Look how Gates reacted during the thing--was not happy.<p>4. It damages the relation of the government and its people. As seen through the FOIA requests, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that several parts of the story don&#x27;t really jive. So, it&#x27;s obvious that there is either bad record keeping in place, or a coverup of some sort. Not in the dramatic sense, mind you, but just minor misalignments of documented reality with official story.<p>~<p>The problem isn&#x27;t that they had the guy whacked--it&#x27;s that they perhaps did such a thoroughly and unneeded job of lying about it afterwards.<p>If you want to see how this sort of thing should be done, look at the Israelis.",1431302859

4584845,comment,4584625,4584735,26,0,Wintamute,,,"Up until a few years ago I was a full time Flash developer, working in ActionScript3 which is a strictly typed, fully OO language which conforms completely with the 4th edition of ECMAScript. I used a great IDE (FlashBuilder) that had full code introspection, static analysis, amazing auto-complete and all sorts of great features built in. Unit testing was not uncommon, as was continuous integration, automated build processes and version control. I, and many others, were doing ""real"" programming on the Flash platform and felt totally understood as a developer by Adobe.<p>I'm not going to defend Flash's continued relevance on the web because like most people I think it's had its day but from about 2003 to 2010 the Flash developer community was massive and thriving, people were doing serious programming and Adobe was doing a pretty good job of understanding them and supporting them. It's this wealth of experience that I hope Adobe brings to bear on its HTML5 developer tools.<p>I feel like the relevance of Flash (and Adobe) is really quite poorly understood. A lot of the expertise and good practises from the more serious elements of the Flash community flooded into the JavaScript community and I feel this is one of the reasons JavaScript has developed so quickly. What's more, a lot of the ""web2.0"" style dynamic and interactive elements of websites that we take for granted now are watered down (and much better) versions of ideas that were conceived during those frenzied years of UI experimentation in the Flash community.<p>Granted those years of Flash threw up some UI abominations, but it was also a melting pot of ideas and creativity, the like of which we don't really see anymore, which is a shame in a way. Even though Flash was my livelihood I was happy to move on because I could see it was for the best, but if you ignore Flash your understanding of the last 10 years and the current context of web development is impoverished.",1348825769

Religions don't work. Relationships don't work. Philosophy doesn't work. And psychology certainly doesn't work -- it's a field with more self-deluding, self-important frauds per square meter than any I can think of.<p>But programming works -- if you become skilled at it, you may end up writing real solutions to real problems that people find useful. I get calls every day from people who have problems they could easily solve if only they knew how to program. For example, today I got an e-mail from someone who needed to compute the relationship between sensor height and volume in an underground storage tank that (a) had an unknown shape and size, and (b) had also been deformed by overhead truck traffic over decades. I solved the problem for him, using a little math knowledge and some simple programming.<p>Programming is to modern times what literacy was to the Middle Ages -- it puts you in the enviable position of having an essential skill, one people simply can't do without.<p>> <i>I Am Not A Programmer</i><p>I am a programmer. Looking through my notebooks from the 1960s, I realize I was a programmer before I had a way to gain access to a computer -- I kept trying to solve problems algorithmically, years before I had a chance to write a real algorithm or see it executed.<p>I think back to the early 19th century, the time of Charles Babbage (difference engine) and Ada Lovelace (the first computer programmer), and I think how tragic that they spent their lives pining for access to something we take for granted.<p>This isn't to overvalue computers, only to say that having access to computers now seems like a natural right, a good thing, but being denied that access is like not being able to breathe.

4584799,comment,4584201,4584201,2,0,derleth,,,"Compiler design has an interesting example of how you don't need to be wizardly to do interesting things anymore.<p>Jack Crenshaw's series of articles is an interesting example of this from an era that's already bygone (his example was a compiler written in Turbo Pascal directly generating Motorola 68000 assembly) but is close to our own time in many ways that count. For example, he emphasizes the fast turnaround time you get when your compiler is running on a PC instead of a mainframe across campus.<p>Specifically, his little digression in the eighth part is on-topic here:<p><a href=""http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/tutor8.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/tutor8.txt</a><p>He specifically mentions the multi-pass design common to early compilers (63 passes for a compiler written for the IBM 1401!) as being down to having to fit the compiler into limited RAM. Similarly, Crenshaw's compiler relies on the existence of a fairly capacious stack to allow the parser to be recursive; on a 1950s-era mainframe without a stack, or a 1960s-era minicomputer where procedure calls were not re-entrant, you'd be left to do a lot more bookkeeping by hand.<p>Then you have the massive emphasis on error detection and reporting forced on programmers by the slow turnaround inherent in batch systems: You can't just die at the first error with a one-line message if it'll take two weeks to run the program again; soldiering on and verbosely reporting every step was the only way to get the most out of your precious computer time.<p>And, of course, less-optimized code is easier (and faster!) to generate, but can only be justified if your machine is fast enough the optimizations aren't actually needed. tcc, the tiny C compiler, is a modern incarnation of this idea; it compiles fast enough you can throw the result of the compilation away and run the compiler every time, like you do in Perl or Ruby.<p>And he mentions standardization: His compiler can only handle grammars you can express cleanly in BNF, which is okay because those kinds of grammars are dominant now anyway. Kinda hard to predict that ahead of time, though.<p><a href=""http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/</a>",1348824428

When I read it I could see how it related to hypermedia as it existed in the early nineties, but 1945 seemed rather distant and the paper seemed to stand on its own, rather than being the start of something. I haven't thought about it since, but it now seems obvious that this was because of my lack of knowledge at the time. I wasn't aware then of Englebart's work, for example.<p>I re-read Literary Machines only last year, but had completely forgotten that Nelson included AWMT in it.

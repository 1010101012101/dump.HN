It&#x27;s located directly below those plots and after his criticism of vibration analysis has finished. I agree that vibration analysis would be very hard without FEA, but applying a constant 1g lateral force to a cantilever beam could be easily done by paper and pen (well, maybe also a calculator) and is an overkill for FEA.",1376978393

He&#x27;s an awesome guy and his heart is in the right place, but he&#x27;s much more sales-oriented and concerned with bringing in business than he is with auditing the performance of his employees.

The people are getting what they want to pay for and the suppliers are more than glad to provide them that.<p>This is more like an unplanned emergence of manufactured consent in the agricultural/food/health industry. No single company, lobby, or agency planned on turning our world upside down and replacing grocery stores and farmer&#x27;s markets with supermarkets and drive-thrus.<p>What happened was that over the past hundred years, innovative companies in the food industry came out with delicious snacks, fast foods, and ready-to-eat meals that created a market that never existed before. When these companies grew and got stronger, their marketing message became embedded in the common sense - eat cereal for breakfast, drink 8 glasses of water etc. It was in the best interest of these companies to say &quot;Tired at 2pm? Take some 5 hour energy!&quot; And the consumers voluntarily started stocking up on 48 packs of Capri Sun and 128oz bags of Ruffles.<p>As the companies grew, they were acquired and optimized to sell only the most profitable products. Over time organizations and agency sprouted up to protect the interests of the industry&#x27;s capital, labor, and assets. If that meant ensuring corn was subsidized, so be it. If sugarcane sugar tariffs needed to remain high, so be it.<p>It is easy to claim market failure looking at this solely from the supply side but from the demand aspect, the current market is paradise. Regardless of how good or bad the products are, people genuinely want them. Every now and then, I myself want a can of Pringles. Fulfilling the demands at prices low enough to satiate the consumers does not seem like a market failure to me.",1376976397

Once you start using Twisted you are doomed and stuck in a parallel reality of Twisted-only libraries forever. I have used Twisted professionally for 4+ years, this is not something I just read on a blog.<p>You first say &quot;Oh, I know look at the cute example of parsing a line protocol with it, let my try that. That was easy, I should adopt it&quot;. And then it got you. You want to fetch data from a particular database. That&#x27;s easy, github has a project in Python that does it. Oh but you need it to return a deferred now. You can&#x27;t simply make a connection and block because it blocks the reactor. This library is no good, you either have to pray someone who knows Twisted wrote a Twisted version of it, or you have to write your own.<p>As you pointed out, you can use code to combine threaded and deferred code but it is not fun or easy. Make sure you think twice before adopting it.<p>BTW the best way to learn it is to use it. Don&#x27;t read about it. Reading about it won&#x27;t help much. It is one of those subjects, like riding a bike if you don&#x27;t know how. Once you get it you get it and it becomes easy.

I&#x27;ll speak my mind and if you feel this is too negative, just downvote, I&#x27;ll understand, but I think it has to be said.  They are copying what they are seeing in other language hint: node.js (Javascript). I feel there is a bit of jealousy, Python is maturing, its last exciting thing was 3.0. PyPy has been relegated to the magic academic research corner (unfairly I think).  But, node.js and Javascript on the server is not successful because it has a callback style of concurrency. There are other reasons.  So copying that aspect won&#x27;t make Python more appealing. Heck, Python had an awesome callback library for ages -- Twisted, when Javascript was still use to make buttons flash and Java applets were the hot thing. Did it take off? Somewhat, but not really. It was famously hard to grok. The freshest breath of air so far in practical Python use on the server is using greenlet.  But that also has been pushed to sort of &quot;ah it is dirty, we don&#x27;t like, how will you ever know if your code switches co-routines&quot;.  Well it is not perfect but it is most practical and performant to date.  I wish that became part of core Python.  I wish they copied more from Go, Rust or Erlang rather than a callback style concurrency with some extra sauce on top.

6241937,comment,6240474,6240474,4,0,thristian,,,"I first came across Twisted Python and Deferreds years ago, and it was my first introduction to the world of asynchronous programming. It was a little bit difficult to wrap my head around the intricate braid of callbacks and errbacks, but once I realised they mapped directly onto sequential statements and try/except in synchronous code, I got a lot done.<p>In the intervening years, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of projects re-implementing asynchronous programming (A perfectly valid idea, Twisted certainly has enough backwards-compatibility warts to warrant an occasional rebuilding), but the early attempts used bare callbacks for everything, which I found frustrating because I felt Deferreds were <i>clearly</i> a better system. Later attempts introduced &quot;Futures&quot; or &quot;Promises&quot; which were <i>slightly</i> better than bare callbacks but did silly things like pass the same initial result to every registered callback instead of being composable. These almost-but-not-quite-entirely-unlike-Deferreds were even more infuriating, in a &quot;somebody is wrong on the Internet&quot; kind of way.<p>I&#x27;m really glad to see Guido picking the best ideas out of Twisted&#x27;s Deferreds and trying to make them accessible to a professional-developer audience. If your language/runtime doesn&#x27;t support some kind of co-routines, then your only hope for dealing with asynchronous code to tame callbacks, and Deferreds are the best model I&#x27;ve come across for doing that.<p>(Guido mentions he won&#x27;t be using Deferreds or Deferred-analogues in his Tulip async framework, for undisclosed reasons. I&#x27;m betting those reasons are that modern Python <i>does</i> have workable co-routines, so callbacks and callback-taming aren&#x27;t necessary.)",1376975469

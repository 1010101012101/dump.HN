It&#x27;s true that you can&#x27;t have an O(log N) time algorithm, as arithmetic operations cannot be performed in constant time.<p>A similar situation arises in, say, mergesort when we say that the algorithm takes O(n log n) comparisons. That&#x27;s not the same as an O(n log n) time algorithm; for instance if you think of sorting distinct integers, each integer will take at least O(log n) bits to represent, and to compare two integers you could potentially need to read all the bits.",1419638235

This brings down the average you pay, which brings down the average you offer. Likewise companies now competing for candidates also receiving offers from you now have an easier time sweetening their offers, and so forth and so on.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_Litigation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_L...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/03/22/revealed-apple-and-googles-wage-fixing-cartel-involved-dozens-more-companies-over-one-million-employees/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pando.com/2014/03/22/revealed-apple-and-googles-wage-...</a>",1419638167

For all its inefficiencies, incompetencies, and overall failures, they weren&#x27;t wrong in what they said or did. If the USPS had to cover costs out of everyone who sticks a 49¢ stamp on an envelope, they&#x27;d be out of business in a week. Junk mail is the lubricant that keeps the postal system spinning, so that the two or three times a year you need to send a letter you can do it without spending -- <i>generates a FedEx quote</i> -- Jesus H. Christ, <i></i>$14.81<i></i>?<p>Huh.<p>Look, if the USPS would have financially benefited from Outbox, they would have done it. But Outbox went under because it couldn&#x27;t afford the fleet and labor costs of &quot;undelivering&quot; mail -- in other words, the Post Office explained why they couldn&#x27;t afford to lose junk mail as a revenue source, then Outbox tried to replicate the USPS fleet (on a very small scale!) on consumer deliveries alone, and was surprised when the effort burned through all their cash.<p>Likewise, you don&#x27;t really think you&#x27;re Facebook&#x27;s customer, do you? Or Twitter&#x27;s, or Google&#x27;s? The customer is whoever keeps the company in business. The fact that the USPS can deliver everyday stuff cheaply is their hook.

Probably with horror, shock and disbelief :)<p>Though I haven&#x27;t given this too much thought, I think it boils down to the fact that the software engineering process is not like (and who knows if it will ever be like) older well established engineering fields, and this could be due to a combination of:<p>a) The unbelievably vast number of degrees of freedom and therefore infinite ways an engineer has to achieve a working model. Aside from the requirements and the hardware limits, the only limiting factor is the engineer&#x27;s imagination and creativity.<p>b) The mind blowing complexity of a large software project. The space shuttle, definitely one of the more complex machines built by mankind, is built from about 2.5 million separate parts. The Linux kernel (from 2012, according to wikipedia) has 15.9 million lines of code, and it is by no means the largest software project.<p>c) The relatively young age of the field vs. the exponential rate at which new technologies are devised and introduced in it<p>All this I feel currently puts software development somewhere between an engineering and a form of art. However, I&#x27;m sure many people would find it unsettling to think they have to trust a form of art when flying in a commercial jet at 30,000 feet, launching a $500M space mission, or endless other modern operations that depend on software to succeed. The fact is though, that it does succeed. I doubt the same methodologies are used in every large software project around the globe, but the bottom line is that whatever methodologies are used (not taking into account different levels of effectivity or cost)  most apparently appear to succeed getting the job done without a established &quot;standard&quot;.",1419637135

They&#x27;ve done three incredibly important things in this press release, that has taken me a bit to fully appreciate.<p>First, they&#x27;re the first car company that I know of that has offered serious vehicle improvements as a service, ever. Tesla is offering 40%-50% improvement on range. Imagine Ford coming out tomorrow and saying anyone can bring their cars in and we&#x27;ll improve your MPG by 40%-50% for a few thousand. That&#x27;s unreal.<p>Second, to do this, they HAD to have looked at the possibility of just releasing a new and improved Roadster, with no upgrade kit. However, they not only actively made the decision to not do that, but to offer it as an &quot;update&quot; simply because they saw it as a bigger benefit to their users. This is a move on par with Tesla shipping the new hardware with cars coming off the assembly line, and then activating that hardware once it was announced [1].<p>Third, by doing this, Tesla, is training it&#x27;s customers to recognize that Tesla&#x27;s are a long-term investment. It&#x27;s literally a punch right in the face of modern car manufacturers, letting them know that a new car every year is not the way we do business. They&#x27;re saying that this car is not a product of a year of development, but a product of years of innovation and development.<p>Suddenly, $70,000 for a car is a lot more justifiable if I know the manufacturer will be updating and improving my vehicle in 4 years still.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8556449"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8556449</a>

The fact that there is confusion at all is basically a huge point for explicitly stating your assumptions.<p>Moreover, that is essentially the whole point of the field of algorithms. Your job as an algorist is to abstract the algorithm away from the implementation details of wholly separate systems, and make all of your assumptions explicit.

And, if an algorithm has to assume an entire, specific OS and scheduler is implemented under it, then you have gone about your job as an algorist completely wrong.<p>That is the appeal to practicality. But as if to prove my point, you _do_ end up making assumptions. You are assuming that the scheduler is backed by a priority queue, which is certainly not universally true. You don&#x27;t get to a hard mathematical bound by waving away a detail as important as the data structure that backs the core sort mechanic.

There is also likely a sense of indebtedness to a company when someone is first sponsored. </i><p>This is part of the point: this aspect of immigration labor would ironically disappear if it was easier to get into this country. The fact that its hard to get in and get a job is precisely what creates the imbalance of power in negotiation and further leads to a sense of indebtedness.<p>BTW, this also negatively affects startups. I&#x27;ve been in situations where its difficult to poach someone because of their visa situation (they don&#x27;t know how easy or hard it is to transfer, they feel indebted, etc etc), and additionally, its way easier for large corporations to go through the paperwork to hire outside talent than a small startup thats just 3 founders. Regulation, as usual, creates all sorts of strange counter-intuitive incentives and imbalances.<p>If companies could just hire whomever they wanted, then sure, you might be competing directly with someone from india, but you&#x27;d also be on a more equal footing because that guy from india would have the same mobility to other jobs that you do, and thus would not be so desirable for his &quot;capturability&quot;.

Literally while I was driving back to SF from Palo Alto.<p>At Labs I work for 40 hours per week. Not an on-paper 40 hours -- <i>actually 40 hours</i>. When I was new to the company I found myself one night on a train to Philadelphia for a personal trip. I was bored, so I opened my laptop and answered some emails from a client. The following week I got a mild dressing down from my colleagues for working after-hours and I was told by my manager not to do it again.<p>If I am at a computer more than 10 minutes after 6pm, co-workers start wandering up and saying &quot;you&#x27;re not working, are you?&quot;.

On my drive back to where I was staying in SF, I remembered that on their campus, I&#x27;d seen a barber&#x27;s shop.<p>It struck me that, so that you don&#x27;t leave for 30 minutes, once a month, Facebook has a barber on the campus. Someone later pointed out to me that the buses they run have wifi.

Which means if the qualities that make someone a great programmer are evenly distributed, 95% of great programmers are born outside the US.<p>This is a huge <i>if</i>. Frankly, it is very difficult to make a strong, compelling policy argument on the back of a flimsy, lazy assumption. Yet it is crucial to Graham&#x27;s position and used to support statements that aim to preemptively rebut arguments critics make (&quot;It would be great if more Americans were trained as programmers, but no amount of training can flip a ratio as overwhelming as 95 to 5&quot;).<p>It is not Graham&#x27;s responsibility to prove that the backbone of his argument - the 95 to 5 ratio - is reasonably accurate?<p>> The anti-immigration people have to invent some explanation to account for all the effort technology companies have expended trying to make immigration easier.<p>The reference to &quot;anti-immigration people&quot; is not only insulting, this statement pretends that those who are not swayed by the arguments of the tech lobby must be &quot;anti-immigration.&quot; To the contrary, one can favor immigration reforms that would make it easier for individuals to come to the United States without naively accepting the validity of all arguments tech companies make in support of immigration reforms.<p>Is it not Graham&#x27;s responsibility to explain in a compelling fashion why the tech companies Graham says are &quot;right&quot; are indeed right instead of brushing off anybody who doesn&#x27;t agree as &quot;anti-immigration&quot;?<p>> We have the potential to ensure that the US remains a technology superpower just by letting in a few thousand great programmers a year.<p>Even if one is charitable to Graham and is willing to assume that a) the United States is at risk of losing its status as a technology superpower and b) Graham&#x27;s figure is plausible, he offers no substantive suggestions for how we identify those &quot;few thousand great programmers&quot; and attract them to the United States. In fact, as someone else here pointed out[1], Graham has previously discussed just how difficult it is to recognize the exceptionally talented.<p>Is it not Graham&#x27;s responsibility to provide reasonable detail as to how the United States could actually accomplish what he proposes?<p>It&#x27;s fair to state that comments here are not always charitable to post authors, but it&#x27;s also fair to state that many of the authors simply don&#x27;t make compelling arguments. If authors are disappointed with the criticism they receive, it&#x27;s just as much their responsibility to make more compelling arguments as it is for critics to give them the benefit of the doubt at every twist and turn.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8799869"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8799869</a>",1419635166

8800848,comment,8799572,8799572,0,0,swatow,,,"I think it&#x27;s useful to rephrase the emotive, and unclear language used in this debate (like &quot;driving down prices&quot;) into the language of economics.<p>Let&#x27;s assume there are two types of programmers, normal and great.<p>Now in a competitive market (which the labor market basically is, especially since the collusion issue has been dealt with), wages and employment levels are determined by supply and demand for each type of programmer.<p>The current H-1B system allows in both kinds of programmers, increasing the supply of both kinds, and thereby lowering wages.  It&#x27;s important to note that pg makes a mistake when he conflates lowering wages, with H-1B employees earning less than Americans.  In fact, if wages stayed the same then the H-1B program would have no effect.  When startups complain they cant find the right people, what they mean is they can&#x27;t afford the effective wage needed to steal people from Google or Facebook (there is always a number that would make them switch).<p>Now in this framework, pg&#x27;s proposal can be rephrased as &quot;use H-1Bs to increase the supply of great programmers, instead of ordinary programmers&quot;.  I agree this is a good proposal, because this gives the best tradeoff in terms of cost (i.e. whatever it is that makes the US limit immigration in the first place) vs benefit (reduced costs for employers).<p>When analyzing this situation, it&#x27;s very important to note that high wages are a bad thing in themselves.  Just like high prices for milk are good for milk produces and bad for milk consumers, but given the option to create cheap milk (e.g. artificially) society should always take it.<p>Some people like to compare programmers&#x27; situation to, for example, doctors.  But to the extent that the AMA artificially limits supply, this is a bad thing for society.  Trade unions or professional organizations that use political lobbying (or violence) to artificially limit supply, are harming society for their own benefit.  People sometimes claim that tech is full of clueless nerds.  I would argue that the &quot;nerdiness&quot; of tech workers also correlates with a decreased capacity for the self-deception needed to support AMA style unionization, and that this is a good thing.  It might result in lower wages, all things being equal, but it also results in a better industry overall, and higher growth that itself creates higher wages.",1419635002

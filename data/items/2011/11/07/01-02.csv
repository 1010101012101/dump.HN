3204640,comment,3203427,3203427,1,0,kiriappeee,,,"wow.. why the negativity people?? \nOne primary concern I'm noting here. People talking of how it won't work with how they use the iPad already. The problem with this logic is that most products in the world wouldn't have been a success based on how people were using already existing products. This is a typical situation that people like Henry Ford had to deal with.<p>The whole purpose of designing this keyboard seems to be, to me at least, to transform how you currently use the iPad. To change it from a half hearted effort at content creation to making it a device that's ideal for content creation. Instead all I see is<p>""messes the experience of the iPad"" <- read between the lines of the rest of the message and I understand that the thinking is based on how the iPad is being used already. The key board isn't meant for tiny 2 line email replies. This is for full blown document editing and blog posting and anything requiring a lot of text. Where else would you use touch type???<p>""separate keyboard. omg suckkssss"" <- Did you even look at the video and pictures?? The darn thing folds with the cover!! This is part of its beauty. Taking advantage of the iPad itself and bringing about an experience which isn't intrusive but still works. And here's the best joke of the day. The answers provided for this issue?<p>""Might as well carry a wireless keyboard!"" <-- Yes keyboard warriors. Can I see your products designed as a usability engineer?<p>Point is. It's easy to harp and echo the negative issues. It's what we seem wired to do (remember the echo chamber when the iPad was first announced?). Looking beyond that is tougher.<p>What the echo chamber seems to have missed here is that this brings about two things<p>1) touch typing <- You don't have that with the current keyboard. Not easily anyways. Please don't try to skirt this issue. There's a reason people are building keyboards everywhere<p>2) Integrates with the iPad experience <-- With easy snap on snap off thanks to the thoughtful design with magnets I see this as something that doesn't interfere unlike every other keyboard solution I've seen so far. Even the other kickstarter projects suggested here don't allow for quick pull of put on approaches. They are static/bulky/non complimentary half baked ideas.<p>Disclaimer. I'm just a blogger and an aspiring tech startup guy from Sri Lanka. I am not some PR person for these guys. I just call things like I see it.",1320631083

I was excited to meet Joe Kraus, who gave my favorite Startup School speech ever, but what to do in this format?  Launch into a cooked-up pitch?  But I wanted to talk to Joe, not use him for target practice based on his job.  But wasn't that kind of what I was expected to do?  Still, what a borderline-presumptuous missionary tack to take with someone I respect.  But wouldn't I get over that knowing teammates were counting on me to get us funding any way we could?<p>At last, I decided to skip the pitch, chatted very pleasantly with Joe, got some great advice and his card.  In retrospect, that was really about as much as I should expect in a five-minute sit-down.  He seems twice as much of a great guy as I thought he was.

3204591,story,,,14,4,ghoul2,"Tell HN: Midway review of Stanford online ML, AI, DB classes",,"I am taking all these three classes currently being offered by Stanford, and we are right around midway through them. Just a few thoughts I wanted to share and invite discussion from other HNers taking the classes.<p>Database Class, taught by Prof. Jennifer Widom: This class covers a lot of the Database background theory and practical that anyone working with knowledge/information storage systems <i>will</i> find useful. Quite frankly, being well versed with both SQL and NoSQL databases, my initial interest in this class was non-existent; I only signed up for it with the intention of later dropping out. Midway through, I think in terms of learning delivered, this class handily beats the other two. The way the class is being run leaves absolutely no cause for complaints.<p>1. The material has (obviously) been very painstakingly prepared by Prof. Widom. When teaching about XML databases, she spent the entire class time working in an actual text editor with XML file open, demonstrating the concepts. Similarly, for the SQL class, she spent the entire time in an actual SQL query GUI. This is VERY effective. Instead of just scribbling on a sheet of paper, this conveys a lot more information, in far less time. It is also a lot more rigorous - which is the next point. Lectures are broken into 10-30 minute ""topics"" following natural breaks in the material.<p>2. The entire material, including the exercises are VERY rigorously prepared. There are rare errors in speaking (and there can be no errors when demo-ing with real query engines, for example). When there <i>are</i> those rare errors, Prof. Widom has taken the time to review the recordings and added corrective annotations which do not detract. It is easy to underestimate the value of this point - in a live class one can always stop and question the prof about something that confuses you, but in a recording you can't. Rigour is essential to an effective video lecture.<p>3. The exercises have been developed with a lot of thought. They are moderately tough, rarely easy. Also, they come with actual query/db workbenches for you to try out your answers before submitting. This has enabled about as much learning as the lecture itself. If the questions were typical bookish variety or busywork, they would have not taught anything. The fact that trial and error is allowed also aids significantly in learning.<p>4. The professor also takes the time out to do fireside ""chats"" every week. This adds a rather nice touch of interactivity.<p>Pros: Good technical/platform, very well prepared material, perfect presentation, challenging exercises.\nCons: no feedback on quiz questions after due date. Considering how challenging some of them are, a review session going over the ""ideal"" solutions after the due date would be very helpful.<p>All in all, a VERY successful implementation. Kudos as well as thanks to Prof. Widom and team!<p><i>Machine Learning class</i>: Taught by Prof. Andrew Ng. Prof. Ng is famous for (amongst other things) his popular tutorials on various things in machine learning. He is clearly a good educator, and the course follows, technologically, the same structure as DB class. That said, the course seems to target a (very low) common denominator, and at least in my opinion wastes a lot of time in basics. An entire set of videos were spent teaching Octave. About halfway through only very basics of machine learning have been covered - even there, an inordinate amount of time is spent on terminology and very little on actually taking about real world applications and problems related to that (this was the promise when the course started). The review questions aid in review of the material present, but rarely challenges one to learn beyond what has been said in the lectures. The programming exercises are a very nice feature and the test-and-submission-rig that has been built are quite good. That said, once again, a typical programming exercise involves not more than 1-2 lines of code in each part with 5-8 parts to an exercise. This yet again, just seems like learning to code in Octave.<p>Overall, I'd say that its a very good introductory class, but spends too much time on very basic stuff. The technical infrastructure is good, content is well prepared but is just not challenging enough. It does not transfer enough knowledge per unit time consumed. If its content level were improved, it would be a great class.<p>Pros: Good tech, well prepared material.\nCons: low knowledge transfer rate, low level content.<p><i>Artificial Intelligence</i>: Taught by Profs. Thrum and Norvig. Both of them are giants in the field of AI, and Prof. Norvig literally wrote the Bible on it :-)<p>That said, the technical infrastructure around the class is detracting. Review question embedded inside the videos themselves, while cool in theory, are very distracting when actually trying to understand something. Also, breaking up lecture segments into 1-3 minutes chunks disrupts all focus. While the material is reasonably advanced (and thus makes for a terrific potential to learn things), there is a distinct lack of rigour in the way its presented. Having errors in algorithms scribbled on screen (while natural) is very disruptive when actually trying to understand. Around due dates, the website invariably dies, last time remaining unavailable for over a day.<p>Pros: good set of topics, good material\nCons: Bad technology/platform - very disruptive to actual learning. Lack of rigour and preparation in presentation.<p>These are ofcourse my personal views and I do not wish to detract from the humongous efforts on the part of all the faculty, the knowledgelabs team and all other people who have worked very hard to bring these classes to hundreds of thousands of people.<p>How do the other HNers feel about the classes you are taking?",1320629909

Types, in the broad sense, are constrained proofs over the properties of all elements in the domain and codomain.<p>Types are useful -- they're perhaps the greatest success of formality in software engineering ever. However, they're not complete and completeness is <i>hard</i>. Types succeed because they provide a lot of benefit for very little pain (the constraints you discuss in your post). Your assertion is simply reinforced when we look at the other classes of correctness that we could guarantee. We could write fixpoint definitions for all functions which require structural recursion. We could push all side effects to typed lambda calculus sugar.<p>Fundamentally, we could <i>prove</i> our code correct. But that's a pain in the ass. And it <i>still</i> doesn't work. Tests complement proofs -- they ensure that our own conception of the definition fits our expectations. We could do all the work to formally prove our conjectures, but if our definitions were wrong the conclusions would be useless.<p>What I'm saying is that all of these things should work together -- and the result is a balancing act. We want additional guarantees that our programs are correct, but it requires us to program differently because only certain types of programs have the properties that we wish to exploit.

It is about consistency, availability, and partition tolerance, and which of these you are willing to give up. Surprisingly few people know about the CAP theorem and what it implies.<p>Generally there two main reasons why you switch to NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases.\n1. You need to scale out (add more storage and query capacity by adding more machines).\n2. You do not want to be locked into a relational schema.<p>There is no magic in NoSQL! To scale out these stores give up exactly those features that would impede scaling out (for example global transactions).<p>What one has to realize that you give up a lot by letting go of relational databases: Fast ad hoc queries, transactions, consistency, and the entire theory and research behind it.\nI don't see why relational databases are ""unsexy"". A good query planner is almost a work of art and it is amazing what they can do. In fact we use them alongside HBase.<p>Instead of ad hoc queries you either get slow map/reduce type ""queries"" or you need to plan your queries ahead of time and denormalize the data accordingly at insert time.<p>You better have <i>very</i> good reasons for the switch.<p>When we evaluated NoSQL stores a while back (for #1 type problems) I was quite the skeptic. We looked at Riak, Redis, MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra, and HBase).\nEventually we settled on HBase because needed consistency over availability and we needed more than just a key value store, and we already some Hadoop projects... and I started to drink the cool-aid :)<p>Personally, I am not a big fan of eventually consistent (but highly available) stores, because it is extremely difficult to reason about the state of the store; and the application layers bears a lot of extra complexity. But your mileage may vary.<p>HBase of course is new as well, and I needed to start fixing bugs and adding new features that we needed.<p>As with ""Java is better than C++"" type discussions, here too, what store to use depends on the use case.

I moved from the UK to Canada, where the construction trade is solely imperial (it's not like the UK where you can get legacy tape measures that have inces and meters, I have inches and feet) and I didn't struggle. It was about a month before my boss said ""Doesn't the UK only use meters, are you coping with the change?""<p>Of course I coped, I learnt to think. A foot is a generalised measurement so that multiple people can work to the same measurements. A meter is a generalised measurement so that multiple people can work to the same measurements.

How lacking is your education that you can't find 9/16ths on a tape measure?

Individuals have a hard time using international tax law similarly because of CFC rules (closely-held foreign corps).  If anyone owns more than 10% of a foreign company they must include or report the income as part of their current earnings.<p>2. The effective tax rate is only ""2.something percent"" of income the income google earned outside the US.<p>3. To have an APA (Advanced Pricing Agreement) with the IRS is incredibly expensive and time consuming because it's like getting audited in advance and then justifying it before you ever do anything.<p>4. You need to pay at a minimum a big 4 accounting firm 10 million to start a project of this complexity over a number of countries.<p>5. The dutch companies are simply a ""conduit"" to allow the money to ultimately reach the Caribbean island tax havens because they have no income tax and simply charge a flat tax of 15k.<p>6. On cperciva's note, this tax plan could be considered ""post-poning income recognition"" but in reality it effectively is never repatriated or brought back into the country because google is such a multinational company.  They could use the money for their international business very easily or they could use their foreign cash reserves to purchase an asset in a foreign country and still retain the ownership by the US main company.<p>I could go on for a while but this is just a the tip of the iceberg.<p>I've practice this area of taxation before as a CPA so I could give you a number of other examples.",1320629091

3204527,comment,3204159,3204289,6,0,127,,,"Sounds like a society of couch potatoes and drug addicts to me. From my perspective you have a much too optimistic view on the human race. If people are not forced to exceed, they will not. Suffering, that does not cripple, defines us. It makes us stronger, more agile, more determined. I would go so far as to say that when we have dreams and goals and we strive to achieve them, by making work towards step by step, each moment we feel better about ourself. Each success builds us and makes us more confident.<p>If it were not for women, I'd just sit home playing World of Warcraft, drinking energy drinks and masturbating, to put it bluntly.<p>Even if our basic material needs are met through automation, we are all still engaged in a very bitter competition for other resources, you do realize. There simply can not exist a state of utopia as long as we reproduce sexually (I have a very Freudian view on this). This is a catch-22 of course. The state we are in defines what we consider an utopia.<p>You are assuming that if we didn't have to worry about producing material resources, creativity and intellect would be the determining factor in who gets their way. Why not violence? Why not intimidation and sociopathy? As tightly knit social groups (small villages and communities) break down and we live in one global village, nobody really knows each other. Most of the people we meet are complete strangers to us. It's much easier for exploitative and cruel personalities to thrive, because they can stay hidden in plain sight. They can pretend and manipulate to their dark hearts content without the fear of retribution. If they get discovered they can just move to a different location.<p>As we have more material resources as welfare and a legal arm heavily protective of women and children, women don't need a protector nor a financier. They can just get the sperm they want and raise kids outside of marriage. Old institutions that were the bedrock of civilized society will all but crumble to dust. Widespread soft polygamy will replace it. Those with the most instant charm and good appearances will win, instead of those who build things to last on the long run. Short term strategies will win over the long term ones.<p>These are all hyperboles I use to describe my views of the modes of societal change and interaction.<p>It is my theory that the easier it is to meet material needs, the lazier people get and more prone to instant gratification. It's not that difficult to extrapolate from this one simple truth.<p>Also one of the problems I didn't touch upon, is how our natural instincts that were developed for a very different world will overtake and corrupt us: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernormal_Stimuli"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernormal_Stimuli</a>.

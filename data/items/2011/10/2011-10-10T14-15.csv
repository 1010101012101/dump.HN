Both Java and CLR bytecodes are designed specifically in a way so that they are <i>verifiable</i>, so that the compiler can be sure that the code doesn't do anything it's not supposed to do (e.g. access IO functions, write to unallocated memory, spawn new threads, ...). Also, a browser has to be able to ensure that untrusted code can only use a limited amount of resources, that is why we have garbage collection, and VMs (interpreted/JIT compiled code can be controlled and interrupted more easily than native code).<p>Higher level constructs carry more semantics, that is why they are easier to verify/sandbox.",1318258789

Certainly it helps to learn this sooner in life than later.<p>I took summer school to get classes like Health, Drivers Ed, and so forth out of the way to make room in my schedule for classes I wanted to take but wouldn't have been able to otherwise: Woodworking, Introduction to Networking (ICDN1), and Computer Repair (A+ Cert).<p>Also, summer school was a neat experience.

3094010,comment,3093450,3093635,6,0,morrow,,,"I went DVD-only.  I had worked up a list a mile long of movies I wanted to watch, and most of them were only available on disc, so I ended up going with that, figuring when I was done I could switch to streaming (and by then they'd probably have more content).  I had some trouble following this plan, however, after the 3rd or 4th disc in a short while stopped playing on me or skipped around half-way through.  Every time it had happened, I cleaned the disc carefully, and then reported the problem (if it persisted) through their site.  The only recompense they offer for this is to either send out a replacement disc or to send the next movie out, and as I'm midway through the film, and don't exactly want to wait 3 days to finish it, I ended up always just skipping to the next movie, or suffering through the skips.<p>After the most recent bad disc, I did what the OP mentioned, and honestly looked at what value I was getting out of the service, and I ended up cancelling.  I understand that discs get scratched in transit or handling, and I understand that I'm living in the past as far as digital vs. physical media goes, I just think what it boiled down to for me is that when you separate the DVD and streaming services out, neither of them really stand up on their own as worth their cost.  I'd probably re-subscribe to the streaming if they improved their selection or lowered the cost failing that, but I don't think I'd bother with discs again.",1318258481

I agree with the other posters that the value proposition based on your website is still a little vague.<p>All that said, changing the BROWSER of a user causes a whole bunch of other problems that you will run into.<p>First, you want to reduce friction of web-service adoption, but require that users change their browsers first? This creates friction where there was none before. A vast majority of internet users still use IE because they think its the internet - not because they made a conscious decision. Its clear you will miss these users (not just because its Mac only).<p>Other segments could be blocked by IT departments, internal web-app support (I only assume you mask webkit somehow?), or the choice of browsers already installed by other users (kiosk, family computer). Most of the consumer market is covered web-service wise with GMail, Dropbox, and Facebook. Most of this market uses the services their friends use, not something an esoteric browser will suggest to them.<p>There are other businesses out there that help you 'discover and sign up' for web-based services, including but not limited to getapp.com, appdirect.com, and more integrated solutions with identity management and SSO for organizations.<p>Now that you have your beta - don't be too inclined to start building complex discovery features that no one will see. Adoption of your browser as the top of the funnel is your primary goal. You first have to overcome reasons to use Safari, Chrome, or Firefox with a unique value proposition they could only get through your browser. Right now a user can use Chrome and go to one of those sites I mentioned and they never had to download and install your product to do it.<p>I understand the 'lets flip it on its head and get them at the browser level' but thats a war usually fought for different reasons, requires a level of investment probably not worth what you are trying to do with it, and all during an era where desktop browsing is declining in favor of mobile-web and native app experiences are taking over.<p>Still, I could have completely missed the reason for Raven and what it is trying to accomplish and my response is only based on my experience so YMMV.",1318257562

GWT os compiling Java, a statically typed language, into Javascript. If you've used GWT you'll know that particularly early on there was a lot of friction. What's simple in Javascript with anonymous objects and duck typing doesn't quite gel with Java so you've had to do things like use JSNI for edge cases.<p>Google has some incredibly large and ocmplex JS apps (eg GMail). While GMail isn't written in GWT, GWT is aimed at that kind of application with deferred binding and the benefits of static type analysis.<p>What if you took that expertise (of GWT and static type analysis in producing Javascript) to produce a language that could run on the server, run in the browser (for browsers that support that) and compile to Javascript (for browsers that don't)?<p>The last point is particular is key to driving adoption as no one is going to develop only for Chrome.<p>I see it as no surprise the syntax is Java-like. I fully expect sometime soon to see a JVM implementation that will then leverage all the existing Java libraries.<p>In that context (IMHO) it makes a lot more sense.

Particularly since there are other options (e.g. Amazon, Blockbuster) that could grow to compete with Netflix.<p>It will be interesting to see how things play out between the media streamers and content providers.  Unless a media streamer can get an essential monopoly on its market (e.g. Netflix in movie/TV, Spotify in music) to be able to set favorable terms, I think its going to be difficult for any streamer to be really successful.<p>I agree with many others that Netflix is doing a fantastic job of destroying its public image and goodwill, which is opening the door for other companies to make a push.  And their streaming selection is so limited - I got the streaming trial, but couldn't find a single movie on which I wanted to spend two hours of my life and cancelled the trial a week later having watched nothing.

The Google deal basically lets Google place ads on Yahoo search results, if they can get a higher price.  As a result of its market leadership position, Google commands higher rates for ads.  Now that they're deploying ads in Yahoo results, they will get even better at selling ads, pushing rates up further.  Since Yahoo is selling less ads, they will get more dependent on Google to monetize their search.  The eventual case is that Yahoo outsources search advertising to Google, and Google has a virtual monopoly on search ads.  Advertisers will hate this.",1217321293

The earliest reference i can think of for this idea was a Heinlein novel where he basically described web/hypertext (not sure where he picked it up, he was pretty upfront about only needing to be 6 months ahead of the pack to appear to be a predictive genius! ;-)",1217320340

They're making more on the google ads in that location than they were on their own ads.  And, of course, there's plenty of rumors out there that the board and Jerry had to come up with a better alternative than MSFT's bid to buy their search product.  Sounds like they're doing everything possible to keep their search business and monetize it by any means necessary.<p>If the bags were packed, they'd've sold.",1217319951

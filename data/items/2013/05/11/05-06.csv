Its great to fully inform people of the security tradeoffs and you've done a nice job of laying out the levels and options of security that we've spent a lot of time developing.<p>In anything that is cloud based there is going to be some level where some hacker could get in and destroy everything.  Most people on this site use cloud hosted servers, all of which would be at risk if Amazon or Rackspace got hacked.  BI in the cloud is a new space and will be cautiously entered by some, but benefits will outweigh the potential risks and just as has happened in every other segment of cloud computing.<p>(will write more soon)",1368251987

5689835,comment,5689736,5689736,14,0,kevinpfab,,,"I'm a founder of Emergent One, a startup that uses similar agent-based technology to Chartio to access production databases and build out RESTful APIs. Some of our APIs are write-enabled, which makes the proposed risk even higher than that of Chartio's.<p>We've spent a <i>lot</i> of time thinking about security risks and writing code to reduce them. I thought I'd share a few things we do and that we've learned from our experience:<p>* The agent approach is the most popular because it allows for a system administrator to easily sever the connection from the database server without having to worry about writing queries to revoke user access.<p>* We never run unindexed queries without an explicit request from a customer and a manual entry from an Emergent One employee.<p>* We're currently looking into security consultants to continuously test our production environment.<p>* We're building an appliance version of our software much like Github Enterprise in order to accommodate the customers that aren't comfortable with their data hitting the cloud.<p>* We strive to have very quick and personal customer service directly from engineers. The vast majority of the responses are within the hour.<p>and last but certainly not least...<p>* The very best thing we can do is be honest and straightforward about the inherent risk behind our platform. Being able to build and maintain a pristine level of trust is the only thing that will keep us in business.<p>I'm sure Chartio does things very similarly. Direct-database access technology is not for everyone, but it's also proving to be extremely valuable for both Chartio's customers and ours. The cloud advantage that makes most SaaS software great is still there.",1368251960

5689820,comment,5689731,5689731,9,0,dietrichepp,,,"I think there are two complementary parts that Linux gets right here.  One is as cited in the article, that you get personal glory for improvements you make to the kernel even if they are fairly small.  The other part is that there is for Linux someone who will say ""no"" to a patch.  Linus will certainly do it, and other trusted devs will do it too.  Linus is perhaps even famous for telling people when they are wrong.<p>I've seen a number of open-source projects where you get all the personal glory for your additions but there is nobody who takes the responsibility to tell people ""no"".  These projects, almost universally, turn into bloated messes over time.  Open-sourced computer games seem to fall down this path more easily, since everyone and her little dog too has ideas about features to add to games.",1368251435

That's fine, it's a choice, but there is a frequent claim that the massive incremental time demand of kids makes one so much more time efficient at work that it more-than-compensates. Insofar as one is the same human being, with the same energy reservoirs and time management skills as before your child was born, this is unlikely.<p>I understand the reason this fiction is maintained: people with kids need the job even more than people without, and have an interest in denouncing people who claim kids make you less productive. There's also the second order effect in which ""with kids"" is correlated with ""older"".<p>The net of it though is that devs with kids tend to assign work a lower priority, to take fewer risks, to need more money, and to be older and hence less familiar with new technologies (and too busy to learn in their free time).<p>Society doesn't have a good answer for this situation yet. In times past, technology didn't move so fast that experience was mostly obsolete (and hence useless) in a decade's time. A 40 year old farmer with kids in 1713 would probably have much to teach a young whippersnapper. The same isn't true for a 40 year old programmer with kids in 2013.",1368251294

It&#x27;s meant to have a melancholy, no-end-to-the-story tone.  That&#x27;s the entire point of it.<p>What people have to realise is that most of the rest of the world sees silicon valley entrepreneurs based on what they saw in The Social Network.   Ziplines into the pool and young girls hitting bongs while nerds with headphones bashed out code nearby, oblivious.  So something like this would serve as a strong counter-current to the prevailing narrative, that it&#x27;s just a case of hopping the bus and pitching your ideas and becoming rich and famous while still young.<p>Realistically many career paths have low probability, high reward exit points, and that continues to attract youth.  The movie or music businesses are really no different.  It could easily have been a story about LA and a bunch of wannabe actors waiting tables and going to auditions - some will luck into roles, others will burn out and take normal jobs, a lucky few will walk into top roles because of connections, family or supreme talent.",1398398084

For those reasons, the US Naval Research Lab&#x27;s electricity-to-fuel synthesis relying on seawater for both hydrogen and CO, using the Fischer-Tropsch process, and producing fuel at a $3-6/gallon price estimate (I suspect that will go higher, and at present, crude oil price is about 70% of the final cost of gasoline at the pump), might allow for a continuation of fossil-fuel energy systems in a carbon-neutral and sustainable fashion.<p>Not cheap by a long shot, but plausible.",1398397800

So were Confederate dollars, so were Weimar Reichmarks, or Iraqi Dinars.  Currencies stop being currencies when people perceive there is a fair chance they might lose a lot of value within a year&#x27;s time.  Bitcoin is worth half what it was five month&#x27;s ago.<p>Then he quotes from Marc Andreessen: &quot;It&#x27;s not as much that the Bitcoin currency has some arbitrary value and then people are trading with it; it’s more that people can trade with Bitcoin (anywhere, everywhere, with no fraud and no or very low fees) and as a result it has value.&quot;  This shows that Andreessen has no concept of what value is (I&#x27;ll give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he&#x27;s not being disingenuous).<p>It&#x27;s also not a falsifiable argument.  People trade with Bitcoin (most importantly trade significant paper currency for Bitcoins) so he says it has value.  If people stop doing that, then by his definition it has no value.  &quot;It&#x27;s valuable because it&#x27;s valuable&quot;.  I know precious metals will retain their value over the long term.  Bitcoin certainly will not.<p>Only commodities have value, from a widget in a factory, to a bucket of water pulled up from a backyard well.  It is why a precious metal such as gold has been a currency for thousands of years.  Gold had value 3000 years ago, gold has value today, gold will have value a century from now.  It is why the US keeps hundreds of billions of dollars worth of gold in Fort Knox.<p>This is a giant Ponzi scheme.  If anything is a sign of a bubble, all the VC&#x27;s talking up this bogus Bitcoin Ponzi scheme is.  Notice nothing they say is falsifiable either - a solid statement is me saying plain as day that Bitcoin will be worthless. They are just making vague assertions about how something is valuable if it&#x27;s perceived as valuable, which at the end of the day means absolutely nothing.<p>That posts like this skeptical of the Bitcoin Ponzi bubble are downvoted into oblivion on HN are yet another sign of the irrationality of this bubble.

I disagree with you, though given the circumstances that certainly isn&#x27;t unexpected.<p>Please bear in mind that the Temple of Thelema (where I assume you found the quote) is one of several Thelemic groups, and do not necessarily speak for everyone. Still I am genuinely curious as to what you find offensive about that particular statement. If you take the Great Work as the perfection of the individual (which I do) I don&#x27;t see what could possibly be wrong with that.<p>If you really think that Thelema is designed to &#x27;erode the reason and instill faith&#x27; you are mistaken, but you can&#x27;t be faulted for thinking that for a brief internet search. Any philosophy is complex, and the things that you&#x27;re most likely to see first are the more sensational aspects, and those do appear superstitious.<p>As far as justification for my epistemology I didn&#x27;t offer that because it doesn&#x27;t exist. Thelema is not the basis of my epistemology, my experience is. Thelema is how I describe and relate to that experience.<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t really hope to or desire to convince you - that&#x27;s not particularly important. Just hoped to express myself a little more clearly, have some dialogue, and try to understand what you find offensive about the quote.",1398396046

All customer facing links need to be connected with free peering to a regional IXP, making the last mile net neutral. To get actual global routing of traffic you need a route to all IXPs in the world. You can build infrastructure to every IXP in the world yourself or you can pay a transit provider to do that for you, possibly in coordination with other transit providers.

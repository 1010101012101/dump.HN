Corruption in central planners however is catastrophic.<p>>Not necessary, they can just take quick actions. Markets can&#x27;t predict the weather either.<p>Markets don&#x27;t predict complex systems, they are the complex system.  They trend towards equilibrium when possible.  Guessing where that equilibrium lies is nearly impossible for humans, but they try everyday.<p>>3) Never sleep or take vacations.<p>Never bought anything after 9pm?  Amazon isn&#x27;t a bad place to go for that, or Walmart, 7-11, nightclubs, bars, restaurants.  Also while exchanges close there is after hours trading, orders being placed etc.  The second the opening bell rings on the exchange there is an implied opening price that is different from yesterdays close due to 24/7 activity.<p>>Not necessary, since the market has proven that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t result in any 100% perfect arrangement regarding needs either.<p>Read about Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s trip to the Clear Lake grocery store in the US in 1989.  The US Market had better performance than Soviet central planners at stocking a grocery store according to demand.<p>>The needs of a huge percentage are ignored (to the point that they can even die homeless and sick), 0.1% controls 80% of the wealth, and even individuals are taught and conditioned to make bad decisions all the time for their own needs, destroying themselves in the process (e.g. having easy credit pushed upon them, etc).<p>Payday loans are an interesting phenomenon.  Maybe they should be illegal, but no one in there right mind would charge anything short of usury rates with default levels as high as a payday loan operation.  You are free to go head to the bad part of town and start lending at prime rate, but you will be destitute in one week.  The alternative is no loans which may be better.  Also in the US homelessness seems to be driven not from economic problems but from mental health issues and addiction.  You may get hit with a massive medical bill, but without making a lot of mistakes along the way you will have a roof over your head.<p>>All those arguments presume the market is 100% perfect, or even if they don&#x27;t presume that, they still ask that the &quot;planning system&quot; should be 100% perfect (instead of just better than the market which would be a more logical demand).<p>Those arguments say that to be better than an imperfect chaotic system, you have to be able to perfectly model that system then make decisions about it.",1446299836

My day job involves understanding the finance &quot;rule book&quot; and translating part of it into something that developers can understand and build to.

I guess what I&#x27;m asking is how do we put a dollar and cent value to defensive cyber security?

However, if the buyer and seller are both willing to make the trade at roughly the same time, then it&#x27;s much better if they do it themselves (splitting the 50 cents of value amongst themselves) than if a middleman gets into the picture.<p>More or less the argument made here: <a href=""http://smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3890"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3890</a>",1446299215

That is of course not mutually exclusive because you could usually do some longer term planning and resort to quick interventions when needed.<p>But could you really isolate those? Wouldn&#x27;t quick interventions in one area not likely also have indirect effects on other areas making at least some smaller adjustments necessary? This looks to me like you would become pretty busy doing quick interventions and propagating the ripples through the rest of the plan at which point you are back where you started without any longer term planing.<p>It seems to me that any form of longer term planning incurs a cost by not being able to react in a timely manner, effects propagating asynchronously and as fast as possible in markets would propagate way slower over a couple of planning iterations because they are unnecessarily forced into lockstep.",1446299175

It&#x27;s absurd to suggest he deserves jail time, but there is an argument to be made that there should be some consequences (e.g. loss of driver&#x27;s license).  It&#x27;s your responsibility not to put people in danger, even through no fault of your own.  If you can&#x27;t react in time to a reasonable foreseeable event (somebody being careless in traffic such as that kid walking out from behind the bus), then you&#x27;re taking a risk by going that fast. The speed limit is a limit, not a minimum, nor a right.<p>There&#x27;s no way to avoid all risk, and there&#x27;s no way to precisely define when someone is taking &quot;too much&quot; risk. But consequences similarly don&#x27;t need to be an all or nothing afair.  Jail is too much - but community service may not be (say, with traffic victims?).  Or a fine.  Or a temporary suspension of the drivers license.<p>Let those best placed to prevent tragedies like this bear at least some of the consequences, even if it isn&#x27;t always fair.  But even if you agree with that sentiment, it&#x27;s hard to imagine that years of jail time a felony conviction are proportionate to the responsibility this guy carries.",1446298575

I did not have the money to post bail (at the time I was very poor, the bail was very reasonable), and my lawyer told me that a jury trial would keep me in jail for far longer than my sentence would be if I pled down. With my plea bargain, I spent 22 days in jail. I likely would have been in jail for at least a month and a half, even if my lawyer pushed as hard as he could for a speedy trial.<p>With that out of the way, while I understand that the plea bargain process is abused, isn&#x27;t my case an example of why plea bargaining should exist, at least in a limited context?

10482522,comment,10481868,10481868,0,0,lhl,,,"I&#x27;ve been interested in activity trackers for a while and got a MS Band v1 pretty early on. Over the past year MS has been releasing more SDK/API access, which has been great to see: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2015/07/15/microsoft-band-and-health-developer-platform.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2015/07/15/micr...</a><p>One thing to note is that while the SDK (Win/iOS/Android) provides full sensor access, it&#x27;s stream access, which requires constant connection w/o auto-reconnects for subscriptions. Sadly, there&#x27;s no access to sync the device in the way that the MS phone apps do - getting rollups requires using the MS Health Cloud API, which is <i>post</i> sync/upload.<p>Overall I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with my Band (I got a warranty replacement after the screen started fritzing out a few months ago for no apparent reason), but I&#x27;ll be holding off on the Band 2 (and looking closely at the new Garmin Vivosmart HR) for a couple main reasons:<p>* Battery life - my #1 complaint w/ the Band, still unsolved w/ v2. I&#x27;m able to sleep comfortably w/ my Band v1, but w/ about 1.5 days of battery life, it means it&#x27;s always dying if I even forget to charge once. Once I do charge it I&#x27;ll often-times forget it when going out, or it doesn&#x27;t get fully charged and dies while I&#x27;m out and about, so in practice that means that I have it on me and charged maybe half the time. (by comparison, the Vivosmart HR claims 5d battery life)<p>* Waterproofing - the Band is still IPX67 while many other devices like the Garmins are 5ATM+ - this makes a huge difference in the scenarios of when you have to take the device off.<p>Some other thoughts:<p>* All the sensors are great and very few (if any devices) have anything close, but   I&#x27;ve yet to see even a graph of the GSR measurements, much less get anything useful/actionable from it. The UV sensor is similarly pointless. Despite less sensors, other companies are doing some seemingly more useful things with their devices. (vo2max estimates, pulse oximetry, etc)<p>* You can change the time/time zone w/o an Internet connection - I fly and travel a lot and this was actually a huge problem w/ my Basis Fitness Watch, so I&#x27;m really happy that the Band fixed this very early on.<p>* I primarily have my Band synced to my iOS device, and I&#x27;ve had to reset/repair/resync the BT multiple times, but that seems about par for the course for all the devices I&#x27;ve used.<p>* One nice thing is w/ the v2 is that they fixed the charger placement - on the v1, it&#x27;s on the inside of the device and basically leaves a indentation/welt in your arm and just generally was uncomfortable. Dunno how/why that ever got past any sort of product review. That and an OLED/wakeable display are good improvements, but don&#x27;t make for a compelling $250 upgrade.",1446296607

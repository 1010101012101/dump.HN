There is legitimate debate about what kind of balances the Constitution strikes with respect to individual rights versus the executive&#x27;s authority with regards to foreign affairs and war.<p>I think it is pure folly to look at the Constitution with libertarian-colored glasses. The Constitution pre-dates modern conceptions of libertarianism that place individual rights above all else. It was a document preoccupied with outlining a system of republican governments. Representative governance was the first principle, not individual rights. Individual rights are part of the scheme, but they are the exception to the general rule of power exercised by a representative government.<p>It was also a document that was a direct response to a previous document that was deemed to leave the federal government with insufficient powers in the areas of internal security and foreign relations. The failure of the federal government to put down an internal insurrection was a major motivation reason for the calling of the constitutional convention. That fact cannot be papered over or forgotten in the obscurity of history.<p>The NSA&#x27;s interpretations are not inconsistent with its abiding by the law. For better or worse, the Constitution was designed to create an executive with extensive powers in the areas of war and security. It is not inconsistent with the Constitution for the NSA to assert that it does not need enabling Congressional legislation to function. At least, that&#x27;s one perfectly reasonable interpretation of the Constitution.<p>Similarly, the 4th amendment has never applied to things that cross the border. One of the very first things that First Congress did was pass legislation creating a customs apparatus with warrantless border searches. It&#x27;s not at all controversial, legally, for the NSA to assert that 4th amendment protections do not apply to communications that cross the border.",1373326784

6010114,comment,6008248,6009210,6,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> This logic is fundamentally flawed.<p>In my experience it&#x27;s rarely worth appealing to logic when discussing home ownership. It&#x27;s just such an emotional subject that rational debate is often hard to come by.<p>1. Many home buyers make purchases with relatively little knowledge of their local real estate markets. For instance, in some areas heavily hit by the crash, you can find buyers who don&#x27;t know that a considerable amount of the local sales activity has been driven by individual speculators and institutional buyers who are attempting to rent out the homes they purchase. They might be on a block where a double-digit percentage of the houses are rentals and not even know it or recognize how this could affect them.<p>2. Many people don&#x27;t actually run the numbers for themselves so they can&#x27;t intelligently weigh the cost of renting versus the total cost of home ownership and the potential gain or loss if/when the house is sold, an event that could be a decade or more away. At best, they do back of the envelope math and where assumptions are required, use a single set of assumptions that is favorable to the decision they have already made.<p>3. Many people who buy a house are really buying an interest rate and mortgage payment. The recent rise in interest rates has actually provided a good opportunity to observe this: some buyers who are in the market today are willing <i>and eager</i> to purchase a good deal &quot;less house&quot; than they could have purchased even a year ago because they&#x27;re simply targeting a mortgage payment. Many conversations with realtors are eerily similar to conversations with auto salesmen: the best auto salesmen focus on the monthly payment, not the price of the car and what you&#x27;re getting for it, because they know that the average person will apply a completely different, and less rigorous, analysis to the purchase when it&#x27;s done this way.<p>4. Owning the dwelling you call home is an emotional thing, so home ownership proponents often resort to weak arguments like &quot;if you&#x27;re renting you&#x27;re throwing money away&quot; to justify their decision. Of course, there&#x27;s no shortage of things that people &quot;throw money away&quot; on and some of those people, of course, are homeowners. It&#x27;s not hard, for instance, to find homeowners with a $400/month auto lease or a 48 or 60 month loan on a car that costs half of what they gross in a year. And plenty of new homeowners spend more on unnecessary upgrades and &quot;stuff&quot; (i.e. large televisions, expensive audio systems, etc.) shortly after they move in to their new houses. Yet many of these same people don&#x27;t see the irony in bragging about how financially astute they were to purchase a home and start building &quot;equity&quot;.",1373326451

To describe what I mean by this: in order to do some real research, or to perfect the wording of a comment, might require a couple hours of time: right now, unless you are willing to spend all of that time frantically and immediately when a thread is posted, by the time you have managed to contribute something of real meaning the activity on the thread has died down because everyone has &quot;already read it&quot; (and won&#x27;t return) and it may, in fact, have already dropped off the home page (and so will get no new traffic).<p>I thereby feel the need to point out that using a system where the comments are promoted by being viewed inside of the thread has the potential to worsen this effect, as the pool of people available to promote comments will decrease over time, even though the potential value of the comments in question increase over time (as, again, they will be able to have been better perfected, with more research, better wording, and careful thought). I might, thereby, put more weight onto your idea for putting the comments on a page like /newest, in order to better force them to be seen after-the-fact (which, I understand, may be one of the factors you are already thinking about: I&#x27;m just attempting to show that someone else might be thinking about that sort of thing).<p>(This issue has an interesting effect when combined with the Eternel September + Evaporative Cooling interaction effect that this site seems to have: I have found myself &quot;taking a pass&quot; on the first time something is posted, instead working on a comment that I post when the same thing eventually comes up later to a sufficiently-different set of people that it can again accumulate enough votes to hit the home page. FWIW, I would then make the argument that this problem of &quot;good content takes time, and HN is setup in such a way as to discourage things that take time&quot; is a more fundamental cause of the &quot;misinformation due to comment blight by people who don&#x27;t really know what they are talking about&quot; issue.)",1373326152

There are differently named versions of every function and you will call the wrong version with the wrong arguments <i>all the time</i>. The number of functions in the standard library could be reduced by at least 1/4 if they&#x27;d got this right. The official FAQ (<a href=""http://golang.org/doc/faq#overloading"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/faq#overloading</a>) explains that leaving out overloading is &quot;simpler&quot;, meaning <i>simpler for them</i>.<p>- Default parameters are a major convenience that you will miss. Using strings.Replace() to remove some chars from a string? Don&#x27;t forget to pass the -1 at the end, asshole! The -1 says don&#x27;t put a limit on the number of replacements. In Python there would be a max=None default parameter and this would never bite anyone.<p>- No named arguments, because fuck readability.<p>- Forcing me to handle errors is great. Having 20 different ways to do it is not great. Examples: fmt.Errorf(), fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr), errors.New(), log.Fatal(), log.Fatalf(), log.Fatalln(), panic/recover...<p>- Using && and || for logical operators in this day and age is just ridiculous. Why do people keep inventing programming languages as if Python doesn&#x27;t exist?<p>- Don&#x27;t think that just because the Unicode guys invented Go that Unicode is going to be easy. Their solution is not to create an airtight abstraction layer between chars (or &quot;runes&quot; WTF?) and integers. Their solution is to provide almost no abstraction and force you to deal with the inherent integer-ness of all characters. Example:<p>In Python:<p><pre><code>    len(&quot;&quot;)  # 5, because there are 5 chars</code></pre>
In Go:<p><pre><code>    len(&quot;&quot;) // 12, because there are 12 bytes
    utf8.RuneCountInString(&quot;&quot;) // 5, plz kill me i am an abomination

But even to that, I&#x27;d say more introspection is needed -- VCs are not just looking to hand out money without prototypes, and if you have prototypes that are good, and work, and show that you know what you&#x27;re doing, even regular banks can give loans with a good enough business plan (especially with all that internet money everyone&#x27;s been trying to get a hold of recently.<p>Also, I think that maybe this ultra-transient mentality to startups might be wrong, unless you are in the business of incubating.

Most people would like to think that people enter relationships with the intention to make them successful. I think startups are the same way, especially given how people think about them on sites like these and others.<p>Also, keep in mind that building something you love and making money from it instead of taking VC cash doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll be poor by a long shot, it&#x27;s very possible (and I&#x27;d like to say probable, but I don&#x27;t have a link to an article posted on here last week about non-VC exits being generally worth more to the founder). If your idea really is good, then it will make you a LOT of cash, even if you collect $10 from 1000 people on a yearly basis, you&#x27;d only need 3000 people to think your app is useful to make somewhere close to min wage in the US (which is higher than many around the world are paid)<p>But anyway, that&#x27;s just my opinion<p>[EDIT] - Also, another point worth thinking about here -- what about your users?

This is based on the work of John Gall who I&#x27;ve never read and cannot comment on. However he was a pediatrician who has never gone near software, I wonder how relevant the personal anecdotes and experience his books draw their conclusions from are.  
Also what is his definition of complex relating to the above quote? I&#x27;m assuming he could plot a graph with complexity along one axis and utility of starting from scratch along the other. At some point it might cross a certain threshold.  
Also is there much in software development that could really be considered &#x27;complex&#x27;? or, how does complexity scale in software?  
Software could be described as &quot;1000 layers of abstraction&quot; if you are, say, re-writing a program in a high level language you are not starting your system from scratch. All the lower level elements of how it is assembled, run on the computer + all the protocols/ libraries drivers etc. used in the system are not changing.",1373324824

</code></pre>
You don't have to like lisps to like Clojure. In fact it's just irrelevant. There are plenty of people in the community for whom Clojure is their first lisp.<p>The questions should be:<p><pre><code>  * Do you like dynamic languages ?
  * Do you interactive languages ?
  * Do you hate wasting time recompiling your entire program 
    in your static language for a small change?
  * Is your dynamic language too slow ?
  * Do you want concurrency to be like child's play ?
  * Are you tired of depending on immature libraries ?
  * Do you want an evented webserver like Node.js that 
    doesn't force you to write callbacks?
  * ... etc ...
</code></pre>
Your list is the completely wrong set of questions to be asking when considering Clojure.<p>EDIT: it's not that Clojure being a Lisp is not important. It's just not the first question I would ask myself when considering to adopt. My questions are specific to the process by which I want solve problems in a particular domain. The fact that is getting upvotes shows just how surface of an assessment people make when looking at Clojure - ""Oh ... it's a Lisp"".",1279209553

Bad writers almost never have a following and certainly never have the following that Steve has acquired.  I would argue the contrary, that Steve's writing is quite good in that it evokes an emotion in the reader almost without exception.  The emotion may be positive or negative but the fact that the emotion exists is evidence that his writing is not bad.<p>Maybe you disagree with it or maybe you find it objectionably long but those things are different from saying he is a bad writer.  I think Steve's critics are typically angry about something he has written about one of their hobby horses but I strongly doubt too many of them are imploring him to write better.",1279209495

Regardless of any derivative you might obtain from the data, most folks want to retain high-fidelity historical data for two reasons:<p>(a) Future analysis techniques are unknown. Today you might be using method X, but tomorrow you might want to try method Y which calls for an entirely different massaging of the raw data.<p>(b) Backtesting and replay. Simulations and replays of previous trading events are valuable not only for testing a model but also testing the particulars of new ""infrastructure"" code.<p>Both require high-fidelity source data. This stuff is so hard to come by and costs so much money that most people want to be safe and save it forever.<p>To your point on analysis: it is rare that one would directly analyze the source data itself. You'll almost always want to transform the data into something more manageable for model development. The most crude form of this is idea of ""bars"". Instead of looking at tick data, traders tried to reduce the noise by looking at arbitrary aggregations of that data: 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day, etc. Technical analysis using moving averages and other indicators are also examples.",1279209278

Although correlation is not causation... :) Here's my thinking:<p>In the bubble, IPOs abounded and investors were buying whatever shit they could lap up if it had ""e"" in the name. Post-bubble, tech companies that survived have been successful (by definition) and have sought to absorb smaller companies both to gain technologies and to kill off competitors; whereas investors have been wary of new tech stocks. This alone could explain the shift from IPO to acquisition.<p>Also, a small, nimble, well-leveraged tech start-up surely doesn't want or need an IPO anyway. An IPO doesn't make sense if you don't need the cash (unless you VC would rather have an ""exit"" than profits†). It is hard for investors to evaluate the potential of a small tech company; acquisition makes much more sense.<p>† VCs demanding an exit in a fixed time frame might make an IPO impossible -- is this something that happens?

Holding the iPhone 4 without a case, in your left hand, crossing the black strip can result in a worst case drop of 24 dB in signal. As we'll show in a second, how you hold the phone makes a huge difference across every smartphone - and we've tested thoroughly in 5 different positions.<p>Now, there are two vastly different possibilities for what happens to the bar visualization after you drop 24 dB. I happen to live less than one block from an AT&T UMTS tower (it's across the street, literally), and have exceptionally strong signal in all of my house - it's part of why I chose to live here, actually. Signal is above -65 dBm in every single room, in most cases it's at -51 dBm. When I incur that worst case drop of 24 dB from squeezing the phone, I fall down to -83 dBm, which is still visualized as 5 bars.<p>However, in locales that have less signal, but where iOS still displays 5 bars, the drop of 24 dB is visualized much differently. For example, at another test location, signal without holding the phone is -89 dBm, which is still displayed as 5 bars. Cup the phone, and you'll fall all the way to -113 dBm. All the bars dramatically disappear one after the other, people think they've dramatically lost all the signal, and you know the rest.""",1279208873

<i>How do you store, query, and manipulate data that includes 45 million new rows per day?</i><p>Perhaps one shouldn't? I've always been a bit fascinated by the analytical tools in brokerage software - with a pretty good understanding of DSP and an appreciation for the fact that asset prices are somewhat periodic, it's hard to overlook the fundamental similarities between stock graphs and audio waveforms. Once you start performing FFTs or wavelet transforms and get a 'feel' for dealing with signals, patterns become very seductive...possibly too seductive: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect</a><p>Might there be another approach? You wouldn't prepare to go to the store by reviewing and analyzing the 1287 individual footsteps of your previous trip, or try to predict the content of a HN thread by textual analysis of all previous threads. Do we do so at a subconscious level, then? Not really - or rather, our subconscious tends to forget about things as soon as they cease to be important, which in the case of things like walking is a period of seconds or less. Processing large volumes of data is computationally expensive, but it turns out that simple rules can yield results that are both complex and useful, as in flocking and swarming behavior: see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_Intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_Intelligence</a>, plus everything from the wisdom of crowds to nonlinear dynamic systems (aka chaotic ones) like Newton's basin or the logistic equation.<p>I feel there are two other fundamental problems with the massive dataset + analysis approach. One is that you're not working in a closed system, and there's no sensible way to quantify unexpected events. 'Bigcorp CEO in Sex Scandal!' might cause the price of Bigcorp to tank if it's a major distraction or their largest customer base is among rural conservatives. If Bigcorp makes racing cars, it might just be good publicity! Now you can do some kinds of interesting posthoc analysis (eg for news stories that contain a stock symbol, measure the correlation between # of textually similar stories and stock volume/prices using a distributed windowing function) but we're a long way from having a browser plugin that trades based on the contents of your RSS feed.<p>Another problem is that of feedback. As you've discussed so ably above, people who spot an arbitrage opportunity will mine the hell out of it. And as we all know, traders are extremely subject to herding behavior even though all training suggests they do otherwise. Sure there are systematic contrarians, but I bet that if you just want to do academic analysis you could find a contrarian coefficient and quantify its damping effect on price or volume movements.<p>So rather than crunching vast quantities of stored data, I wonder if it might be better to treat price movements not as absolutes which you hope will reach a particular ceiling or floor, but as differential vector data with a short half-life. So far AI and modeling approaches seem to have focused on prediction (surprise) and don't perform especially well. I think it would be more interesting to map correlation variations for as large a number of nodes (listed securities) as possible - think how we intuitively appreciate the dynamics of a school of fish when watching a nature documentary, without performing any detailed analysis of individual fish trajectories.<p>Of course this still involves processing a lot of data, but storing it is less important because are only seeking to become more familiar with high-level behaviors inside that system.

Where a profitable lifestyle business might be happy to grow a few percept per year indefinitely, startups will tend to have a much more ambitious growth plan.<p>In any case, the result is that discussion, comments and advice for startups will sometimes be different than for a lifestyle business, funding being one of the obvious topics.

203371,comment,202201,202769,0,0,jcl,,,"I have to agree with goodgoblin: VC is not quite like patronage.<p>Patronage is gift culture; its message is: ""Look how much I can afford to give away!""  A patron patronizes something not merely with a risk of losing money -- losing money is the expectation and practically the goal.  VCs, on the other hand, invest in something with the hope that they will eventually have more money than they started with.<p>You point out that ambitious VCs will invest in riskier propositions to increase their chances of a big hit.  But their motivation for doing this is so that the big hit draws more money for the next round.  This feedback loop (money -> fame -> more money -> more fame) is not present in patronage, because a patron's fame is not expected to lead to significantly more money.",1212076223

203368,comment,202868,202948,0,0,bockris,,,"Agreed.  When I was in high school I wrote all the normal programs for the Apple ][ and it was fun.  LoRes/HiRes graphics, toy calculations like interest, bubble sorts, etc.\nThen our math teacher offered extra credit if we solved some puzzles.  One was the ""100 Lockers"" puzzle. <a href=""http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56747.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56747.html</a>\nI immediately saw that I could write a program to solve it and so I did.  Afterwards I was struck by how I could simulate physical processes in the computer.  It was a real eyeopener for me because I had always been given assignments before and this was the first time I had applied programming to a problem that I had come across myself.  \nI was feeling pretty smug that I would be the only person to solve this puzzle.  (It was a very small class in a small school and not very many people were even attempting the puzzles.)  When the results were posted later in the week, I noticed that someone else had solved it also but his solution didn't have a printout attached.  I couldn't see how he could have solved it by hand by simulating the opening and shutting like I did in my program so I asked him how he did it.  ""Easy"" he said.  ""I just did the problem for 10 lockers and I saw the pattern of square numbers and added on the missing numbers.""\nThat's when I learned that while brute force works and it sometimes the best approach, it doesn't have to be the only approach.\nAlmost everything I have done in programming since is somehow related to this incident.  World building indeed.",1212076061

Zattoo acquires the rights to retransmit the channels separately for each country we launch in. It takes a lot of legwork (read: flight miles and sizzling phone lines) to collect the necessary rights to transmit the channels. Unlike the fast food world, the media world doesn’t operate on a global basis, so if we acquire the rights to carry a French TV channel in Switzerland, say, we don’t automatically get the right to carry it also in France or Germany.</i><p><i>All of this doesn’t deter us, of course. Chances actually are that we’re talking to a broadcaster somewhere right now, as you are reading this. So stay tuned for more channels in Z-countries and a launch in countries that haven’t been zattooed yet.</i><p>I guess it's possible that they're lying, but given that the channel lineup varies greatly between countries, I somewhat doubt it.",1212075471

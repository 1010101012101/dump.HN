Having to hedge myself against prejudice and sloppy thinking isn't helping me as much as spending time actually having substantive discussion.<p><i>especially in the West, where schools are starting to require that their students have an opinion, even when they don't actually know anything.</i><p>It seems we agree on some fundamental level.  I think the ability and diligence to direct skepticism at <i>oneself</i> is basic and essential.  If one does not know how to do that, one doesn't really know how to <i>think</i>.",1262181746

If you hand registered it and even you don't like it, the odds of it selling for anything above your registration fee is pretty unlikely.  Domain names are some of the most illiquid assets in terms of web stuff.  The only liquid aspect is the reseller market, and that is based mainly on traffic/revenue or some special cases of generic/keyword names.  So, your best really is to just let them expire, perhaps your registrar has an agreement to give you some of the cash if they get snapped up at auction upon expiry (Fabulous, my registrar does).  Other then that, finding them a good home, even for free, is going to be a waste of your time.<p>The only alternative I can think of is offering them for free to whomever submits the most creative idea for each one, but you have to do it somewhere (like HN/Reddit/etc) or your own channels (if you drive decent traffic).",1262181743

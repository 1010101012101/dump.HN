If you sell enough BTC to crash the price, you're still likely to get killed buying them all back to cover the short because:<p>a) There's a lot more bids than asks. It's a lot easier to ratchet the price up than it is to lower it.  If Mr Shark sold 50k BTC in one hit right now, he would move the price from $46 to $31. If he tried to buy 50k BTC in one hit, BTC would shoot up to $100 USD.<p>b) Since the last crash and subsequent boom, there are lots of people now who yearn for the days of $5, $10 or even $15 BTC and will happily buy at those prices[1]. Mr Shark will be competing with their orders during his buyback.<p>Strangely I think the first crash made bitcoin stronger.<p>c) I'm not sure Mr Shark appreciates the psychology of the current bitcoin market. I think he assumes there are people sitting on a ton of BTC who are going to panic and sell at $5.

5331108,comment,5325491,5329324,4,0,unclebobmartin,,,"The earlier startups ('76 and '87) gave me the experience of what a startup is like.  I _was_ the warrior god.  I worked 60, 70, 80 hours per week.  I _knew_ I could overcome all.  In one case it worked, and in another it failed.<p>By relfecting on those experiences, and many other experiences in companies large and small I have since learned a great deal about programming; and about human nature.  One of my greatest realizations is that you cannot go fast by rushing.  Every shortcut you take slows you down.  Every attempt at cutting corners, adds more corners.  And so I adopted the mantra: ""The  only way to go fast is to go well.""<p>In 2002, when I started the FitNesse (fitnesse.org) project, TDD was the rule.  I didn't know how well it would work, because I was very new to TDD at the time.  But since the risk was low, I gave it a shot.  It succeeded beyond my expectations, both as a programming discipline, and also as an open source project.  The power TDD gave us (and still gives us) to keep the code clean and under control is something I'd never experienced in any other project.  It was profound.  It was powerful.  It allowed us to go fast, and _keep_ going fast because the code stayed clean.  I have come to view it as a moral imperative.  No project team should ever lose control of their code; and any slowdown represents that loss of control.<p>I have since consulted on many projects using TDD, and have helped many others to adopt it.  My son, Micah, who was the lead programmer on the FitNesse project, continued to practice TDD in other projects for clients of my company, with great success.  When he founded his own company, 8thLight.com, TDD was a founding principle.<p>When it came time for me to start another company, (cleancoders.com) TDD was, and has remained, a founding principle.  TDD keeps the code under control.  That control keeps me going fast.  I can't imagine surrendering control of the code ever again.<p>There's an old saying:  ""Your true beliefs are exposed under pressure.""  I'm glad your AgileZen story had a happy ending; but I think you got lucky.  When the pressure came, your true beliefs came out, and they did not include TDD.  You abandoned the discipline because you thought it was slowing you down. And now you are communicating that meme to the world at large.  That's a shame.<p>As long as someone thinks TDD will slow them down, they will abandon it whenever the pressure is high enough.  I, on the other hand, know that TDD speeds me up.  So when the pressure comes, I hold to my discipline.<p>I know I can't convince people that TDD will speed them up.  But as I look out over the industry from my rather long perspective, I see the change rolling across it.  TDD was unknown in 1999.  It has gained in awareness and adoption every year since that time.  The momentum continues to build.<p>In another 10 or 15 years TDD will likely be as prevalent and important to programmers as hand-washing is to surgeons or double-entry bookkeeping is to accountants.  I stand a good chance of seeing that happen.",1362578095

5331007,comment,5330578,5330886,2,0,yareally,,,"One reason to need a fast CPU and lots of RAM is building Android from the source (primarily within the Android modding/hacking community). I mostly point it out because it has a wider appeal than most other large projects that are built from the source by typical users regularly these days and also for its demanding build requirements. Rebuilding the entire source can be lengthy without a fairly new CPU, SSD and lots of RAM. Granted one does not have to rebuild the entire source most of the time, but rebuilding some parts like the framework base (the java userland area libraries), takes a while.<p>Following specs came from Google[1] the other year when ICS was released:<p>-6GB of download.<p>-25GB disk space to do a single build.<p>-80GB disk space to build all AOSP configs at the same time.<p>-16GB RAM recommended, more preferred, anything less will measurably benefit from using an SSD.<p>-5+ hours of CPU time for a single build, 25+ minutes of wall time, as measured on my workstation (dual-E5620 i.e. 2x quad-core 2.4GHz HT, with 24GB of RAM, no SSD).<p>Lots of RAM allows you to switch the compile output over to a ramdrive (or if not, move it to a separate SSD if you have two). Moving the entire source to a ram drive or fast ssd also makes editing much faster (especially the initial load into an IDE like Intellij or Eclipse) or grepping through the codebase. Doing it on anything less becomes somewhat tedious from my experience.<p>[1] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups=#!topic/android-building/N1exifTpPfA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups=#!topi...</a>",1362576232

I use Windows XP at home, which I am fully satisfied with, it never crashed and I haven't had any virus in four years. Maybe I am lucky, but I really had zero problems with it. I also use Microsoft Office 2000, which I consider a very good software.<p>In work, we also run Windows XP, and developing software using Visual Studio 2008, which I consider a very good development tool.<p>Other than that, I mostly use third party shareware and open source software.<p>If I will buy something from MS in the future, you ask? I will very propably buy Windows again with new computer I will purchase. Any other questions? ;-))",1211569020

198284,story,,,1,0,daveambrose,"What does ""social"" really mean?",http://project.arnolfini.org.uk/projects/2008/antisocial/notes.php,"""Instead, the emphasis in these notes is to draw attention to how the production of non-antagonistic social relations has become central to economic production and social control. To take a typical target, the politics of Facebook, with its 59 million users, reveals how social exchanges are mediated by the wider culture and political economy. Personal information (ID and consumer preferences) is voluntarily submitted and can then be accessed by agencies reflecting pervasive viral marketing techniques, hegemonic corporate ownership and capitalistic economic principles â€“ all designed to derive profit from friendship. Furthermore, the social relation is based on weak ties (as opposed to the relatively strong ties of peer production for instance) and an 'unstable social contract' between users and platform owners. That services are provided on the basis of latent profitability indicates the capitalist logic of producing value as cheaply as possible and making sure ownership is kept in the realm of private property. A closer look at terms of service agreements reveals more detail here and confirms that ownership is carefully managed. The contradiction is clear, as Michel Bauwens puts it: 'The social web facilitates an unprecedented level of social sharing, but it does so mostly through the vehicle of proprietary platforms.' In such ways, the social relation is produced in restrictive form."" - March 2008",1211568446

Even salespeople, business developers, and negotiators are contributing towards ""building"" the company.

Also very few know that most of the hotmail users also have gmail as their primary email app. More and more people are using open source docs like Openoffice or StarOffice (free with google app) ... online web-app is also becoming popular (google doc , zoho etc.). MySql is way too popular than anyone can ever imagine. BRIC countries are 3rd world countries and they cant afford XBOX - also this gaming box from MS is not doing that well in north america either.

Not being one doesn't automatically make you the other one.  And that's what I mean by false choice.  You are who are you are and all of us are a little of both if not a little of everything.

I am not asking for zero syntax, or that everything be done in Scheme.<p>For one thing, I'm not a Lisper, which you think I am.  For another thing, Lisp has syntax, so you are incorrect.  For yet another thing, I am decrying <i>Too Much Syntax</i> that encourages too many ways of doing things, not taking a dogmatic stand for absolute syntactic minimums.  True one cannot make a syntax so pure that there is only one way of doing something.  That's a straw man.  But on the other hand, one can make a syntax so complicated that it seems to strongly encourage doing the same thing in many ways.  Perl and Ruby are guilty of this.  Python not nearly as much, but still more than I would like.<p>Syntactic constructs are a tool.  Tools have overhead.  Why have redundant syntactic tools?

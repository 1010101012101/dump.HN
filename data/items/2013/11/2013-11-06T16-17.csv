6683684,comment,6682084,6682084,2,0,bbx,,,"I love it. SVG (or any vector asset really) is probably one of the best ways to handle graphics in a responsive design.<p>Right now, I have no particular issue with resizing my HTML elements with CSS using different margin/padding values. Font size is easily handled as well, considering fonts are basically vector shapes (and it&#x27;s the reason why they&#x27;re rendered differently across browsers). But dealing with images, especially background ones, can be irritating because they&#x27;re pixel-fixed.<p>Another interesting vector resource is icon fonts. I recently started a project that included social icons (Facebook, Twitter, GitHub...) in theme-based profiles. Themes mean different layouts and different color palettes. Instead of generating tons of uniquely colored image sprites of various sizes for each theme, I settled for an icon font. You basically use Illustrator to generate SVGs for each social icon, and you use a tool like IcoMoon to build your own custom font. I can then easily apply a different font-size and color for each theme.<p>Creating vector images is still troublesome, but looking at these demos, I might try to include more SVGs in future projects.",1383757033

Any regulation would need to be sufficiently loose that you do not need a black market.</i><p>Comparing keeping salmonella out of food to keeping drugs clean is apples and oranges - they&#x27;re entirely different problems. Also, given the insane markup drugs are subject to today, primarily due to the risk of distribution, prices would fall with regulation, and imo enough to undercut any current black market.

If other types of developers join HN in large numbers, the situation might change, and it will benefit even web-based SV startups, too.<p>But there&#x27;s another problem. A few years ago I was working for the defense industry, and hadn&#x27;t even heard of HN. We were doing distributed, fault tolerant systems with graceful degradation  things that have since become very interesting for &quot;web&quot; (in the wide sense) developers. Obviously, much of the work done there is classified, but even the parts that aren&#x27;t don&#x27;t get discussed much because that community hardly blogs at all.<p>So it&#x27;s not just a function of what gets submitted or upvoted, but of what &quot;content&quot; (how I loathe that word) is out there, and developers in other industries just don&#x27;t write of their experience as much (which is a shame because we could all benefit from that). Once in a while we&#x27;re very lucky to have some technology leak from the often maligned (here on HN) &quot;enterprise&quot;.

6683490,comment,6682235,6682590,4,0,kozlovsky,,,"MVCC in InnoDB and PostgreSQL are totally different. It is PostgreSQL and Oracle MVCC who have very similar, although not identical isolation behaviour (albeit very different implementation), but InnoDB MVCC stands apart from them.<p>At the beginning, I should point that the default isolation level in PostgreSQL and Oracle is READ COMMITTED, whereas MySQL uses REPEATABLE READ isolation level as a default. This means that in MySQL by default all normal (not FOR UPDATE) SELECT queries see database snapshot at the time when transaction started. In PostgreSQL and Oracle all SELECT queries by default see database snapshot at the time when the query (and not the transaction) started.<p>However, SELECT FOR UPDATE in MySQL sees database at the moment the query started, even with REPEATABLE READ isolation level. That is, it is possible that during the same transaction on default isolation level in MySQL SELECT and SELECT FOR UPDATE see totally different rows. In Oracle and PostgreSQL, SELECT and SELECT FOR UPDATE always see the same rows (at the moment of query start in READ COMMITTED mode, or at the moment of transaction start when in SERIALIZABLE mode). In other words, in Oracle and PostgreSQL SELECTs and UPDATEs see database at the same time in past, whereas in MySQL SELECTs see consistent snapshot at past, whereas SELECT FOR UPDATE and UPDATE see current data.<p>Also, as MySQL uses locks more aggressively, some &quot;write skew&quot; problems which are possible in PostgreSQL and Oracle, are not possible in MySQL.<p>I don&#x27;t know what kind of MVCC is &quot;better&quot;, but IMHO Oracle and PostgreSQL MVCC is much easier to understand than MySQL one. The difference between Oracle and PostgreSQL MVCC is the following: in READ COMMITTED mode, when long UPDATE query encounter some rows updated by concurrent transaction, it is blocked until concurrent transaction COMMIT or ROLLBACK. After ROLLBACK of concurrent transaction the query will continues execution, and this behavior is the same in Oracle and PostgreSQL. If concurrent transaction is committed, then PostgreSQL re-evaluates previously blocked row to determine whether it still matches the UPDATE criteria. But PostgreSQL does not re-check previously read rows which did not satisfy UPDATE criteria, whereas is is possible that these rows were also modified by concurrent transaction and now satisfy UPDATE criteria and should be updated. Oracle behaves in a different way: If long UPDATE query encounters some rows updated by concurrent transaction, and these rows no longer satisfy the UPDATE criteria, the query restarts and sees new database snapshot at the current time (remainder - I&#x27;m speaking about the default READ COMMITTED mode). This way Oracle doesn&#x27;t miss rows which can be missed by PostgreSQL, but long UPDATE can potentially be restarted many times (that is, the query starvation is possible, although not likely).

  dissatisfaction with or opposition to the policies of a 
  governing body, and such expression may take forms from 
  vocal disagreement to civil disobedience to the use of 
  violence. Historically, repressive governments have 
  sought to punish political dissent. The protection of 
  freedoms that facilitate peaceful dissent has become a 
  hallmark of free and open societies. [1]
</code></pre>
(edit)
Oh, and I just noticed a small difference here: they used &quot;political dissidents&quot;, which is even more broad than &quot;political dissenters&quot;:<p><pre><code>  A dissident, broadly defined, is a person who actively 
  challenges an established doctrine, policy, or 
  institution. When dissidents unite for a common cause 
  they often effect a dissident movement. The word has been 
  used since 16th century in the context of religion. The 
  noun was first used in the political sense in 1940, with 
  the rise of such totalitarian systems as the Soviet 
  Union. [2]
</code></pre>
And just so we&#x27;re clear: the article covers many different corpses, not just political dissidents. From the first chapter of the story:<p><pre><code>  In the mid-1930s, British anatomists described with envy 
  the valuable sources of material their German 
  counterparts had.

  The sources of material included many people the Nazis 
  sentenced to death for minor crimes, such as looting, and 
  many convicted for political crimes that particularly 
  incensed the regime, ranging from treason to the vague 
  offense of defeatism.

A very small amount of marijuana or LSD causes the intended effect, yet it&#x27;s virtually impossible to die from overdosing on these substances. Clearly this is not the case with alcohol, cocaine, heroin, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to argue strongly for tiered classification of drugs, but I am saying that it&#x27;s not obvious to me that we should just treat them all the same. There are more-or-less objective measures that we can use to establish their risk to the individual and society.",1383754915

The legal definition may disagree, however, my argument to that would follow:<p>Article 6, Clause 2 of the Constitution: &quot;This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof... shall be the supreme law of the land.&quot; Which loosely translated means &quot;This Constitution and any laws which support this Constitution shall take precedence over everything else.&quot; Consequently, while the &quot;Yelling Fire! in a theatre law,&quot; which may have been upheld by the Supreme Court, and which are probably more for the good than bad, and certainly protects more people than it harms, is actually an illegal law under the Constitution as it seeks to restrict your first amendment rights - which is quite contrary to the Constitution.<p>The wording is explicit. If the wording is not permissive enough for the government and legal system to cope with, then an amendment must be proposed and ratified. There are no amendments to the constitution that say &quot;guarantees the freedom of speech, except where we can convince the Supreme Court to pass a law that restricts that in our favor.&quot; The Constitution is quite clear and explicit - &quot;Congress shall make no law&quot; so any law that has passed that serves to restrict your Constitutional rights are illegal in the eyes of the Constitution.<p>Thus your freedom of speech, in the eyes of the Constitution <i>is</i> absolute. It is only an illegal law, which agreed, made in the best interest of the people, in violation of the Constitution that restricts those First Amendment rights.<p>So what takes precedence? The Constitution or the law? What happens when they conflict? Well the Constitution covers that... &quot;no law shall be passed&quot; which conflicts with the Constitution. So the question becomes what is more powerful, the Constitution or the Supreme Court? I think that can only be answered by the people.<p>Why am I, as a non-American and non-resident of the United States, debating in defense of your Constitional rights and you as an American (is that a fair assumption?) are debating against it?

6683359,comment,6682754,6682754,53,0,jroseattle,,,"Django is one of my favorite open-source projects. I owe the project a lot.<p>Years ago, when I was a Microsoft-only shill (yeah, I&#x27;ll say it), I knew how to build almost anything as long as something from Microsoft was under the covers. I was proud of my abilities, and in spite of the anti-MS crowd, I stood up for my platform and was a good developer.<p>In 2006, I had a short two-week break from my startup job, and my wife & kids were traveling to their grandparents&#x27; house at the same time. I had 336 consecutive hours to spend as I wanted, something I hadn&#x27;t been able to do in many years. I decided I wanted to work on a little side project, something I could complete within those two weeks.<p>I made a decision to break out of my comfort zone. I knew a little about Linux, nothing about Apache, zero about Python, and had never worked with Mysql. I came up with an idea for a simple little CRUD application, just a utility site. It was something I knew I could build in maybe two or three days using Microsoft tools.<p>So, I searched around and found Django. I downloaded v0.9x (it was sometime in the summer, can&#x27;t recall what it was specifically. I know it was pre-v1.)<p>And I started from the beginning, purely a newb. It was a position I wasn&#x27;t accustomed to, so I immediately felt a lack of boundaries and sense of control. But the Django documentation was really good, and I soon gained an understanding of everything I needed to learn -- Python, running Apache, configuring Django, wiring up Mysql. I stayed focused and in one week, I had written my ridiculously simple CRUD app.<p>But the value I got out of it was how well the project pulled me in to becoming productive on a platform that I&#x27;d never used. Not only that, there was the help in the discussion groups from the community. It was a lot of fun, and I could recognize myself becoming a better developer.<p>The biggest realization came when I compared my Django project to an equivalent built on Microsoft tools. It wasn&#x27;t a comparison of one-week vs. two-days, but rather one-week <i>coming from square 1</i>. All this led me to rethink my thoughts around my Microsoft background. I didn&#x27;t become a convert per se, but it made me realize there are so many other ways of solving problems and other systems on which to build applications. And, after feeling productive, it made it easier for me to explore other (non-Microsoft) technologies. The feeling of being productive in multiple environments was so empowering.<p>I&#x27;m not sentimental about software, but the Django project is kind of that kid who can do no wrong in my eyes, due to my formative experience with it.",1383754092

The latter still being unfortunately the driving force behind most interfaces, any designer will need to use some form of this phrase fairly frequently in most real-world situations.<p>2) &quot;Best Practices say&quot; - again, this can be misused, but heuristic and expert evaluations of an interface are the bread and butter of most designers&#x27; toolset. A/B testing, on-site user testing, user interviews, et al, are all great tools, but in many cases, they&#x27;re luxuries. When you&#x27;re part of a small team trying to hit a MVP, starting with baseline best practices is the pragmatic way to go. Insisting on reinventing every dropdown or tabset is a sure fire way to singlehandedly sink a startup.<p>3) &quot;Let&#x27;s use an analogy&quot; - generic, applicable to any problem-solving endeavor. This has nothing to do with UX. This is where the whole article started really stinking of linkbait.<p>4) Jargon - industry jargon is a powerful way of communicating specific, granular concepts to a peer audience. Yes, if you&#x27;re using UX jargon when presenting your ideas to an outside audience, you&#x27;re doing it wrong. But saying jargon is wrong is just dumb, and once again, jargon is hardly a UX-specific phenomenon.<p>5) &quot;The research says&quot; - let&#x27;s just repeat #2 and blather on some more<p>6) Again, see #2.<p>7) Ok, so the basic idea here is that the True Pure UX involves coming up with brilliant new concepts in a vacuum. Leveraging successful ideas is verboten. I&#x27;m not sure how this guy could get anything done without the support of a 20-person UX team, with the other 19 people covering for his theoretical brilliance.<p>8) To be perfectly honest, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever heard the term focus groups used by anyone in the UX field, and I&#x27;ve been at it since &#x27;98. But you need 10 bullets on that list, I guess.<p>9) Probably the only point on this list that I agree with, and something I&#x27;d never seen until very recently. The concept of &quot;stupid users&quot; has obviously been entrenched in the development side since Day 1, hence the need for UX in the first place. But it&#x27;s definitely disturbing to start seeing supposed user advocates start to toss this one around.<p>10) Big numbers are bad unless they&#x27;re the right big numbers. Gotcha, mate. Misusing statistics and measurements is obviously an epidemic confined solely to the UX sphere, and not a basic human foible.",1383753828

These funds and support are not what they expected - but taking financial distractions out of the equation, they have better chances to do it. It's an interesting thing, and the best thing would be to support them or at least wait before calling it curse.<p>Question is if you and me will install and use these nodes?",1274090328

Yes it is.  But like any it is a problem to be solved.  Just off the top of my head frequent release of the progress would migitate this risk. Maybe code or Screenshots  to manage expectation.<p>Look at Obama, tons of expectation or any other popular president, did they deliever as expected? No. I think everybody here knows that the presidents aren't going to deliver as expected.  So, it is with these guys. With all the hype, people can figure it out.

1353936,comment,1351074,1353163,0,0,rythie,,,"I don't think many of the people who create open source projects want to create a business. It's just they wanted to solve a problem and then share that solution with the world. Typically they get employed away by someone who does want to create a business around it e.g. Linus Torvalds, Rasmus Lerdorf, Alan Cox etc.<p>That said, there still is a need for support around this products, so people create businesses around them an employ the people who wrote it.<p>I don't think creating a open source project solely to make a business out of makes a lot of sense in most cases, because profits in the early days will be low and it will take long time to scale that business.<p>Most businesses don't see the value of open source really and your story shows that the company you worked for didn't either. That's not to say there are aren't lots of companies that do realise the benefits. To use your example, some businesses like the Honda how it is and others want to make a race car and absolutely can benefit from modifying it. Google, Apple, Facebook and so on have all greatly benefited from modifying the Honda.",1274089961

1353932,comment,1353079,1353783,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> It seems incredible to me that someone would consider funding a profit-making venture to be an act of philanthropy.<p>I've traveled a little bit - for-profit investment seems to improve quality of life more consistently than purely charitable philanthropy.<p>I think there's two reasons why - first, for-profit investment is carefully measured with a clear goal in mind. Charities almost never measure their results against a control group, so it's not clear how much the charitable donation affected things relative to where the area was heading anyways.<p>Second, for-profit investment has the chance to become self-funding after a little bit, while charity is often more focused on shorter term consumption. There's exceptions, though - libraries and universities, in particular.<p>But if your goal was to have the next generation of a poor area have as many of its children grow up to have happy, productive lives possible - $100 million in for profit investment seems more likely to do that than $100 million in pure donation. Maybe the pure donations have a greater effect of quality of life over the next day, week, month, and year, but over the next generation, investment seems to <i>drastically</i> outperform charity in improving quality of life.",1274089820

1353927,comment,1353820,1353820,0,0,quant18,,,"I find LiveMocha particularly interesting for their use of crowdsourcing --- which has evolved quite a bit since I joined. Basically, they have generic course templates in English, and then give people ""MochaPoints"" (which as far as I can tell are completely useless) for translating the course into their own language, or making recordings of phrases, or even just evaluation others' translations. And of course, MochaPoints are prominently displayed on every profile, making you aware of the pecking order and incentivising you to increase your own points.<p>This isn't a perfect approach (it's heavily biased towards people who like learning by memorising phrases, rather than people who like learning by picking apart sentences through detailed study of grammar --- I don't think crowdsourcing explanations of grammatical points will ever bring satisfactory results, anyway), but it works well for people who like it.",1274089367

1353920,comment,1353750,1353750,0,0,wallflower,,,"I'm sorry to hear that your karma is actually leading you to self-censor. I really feel it shouldn't. Like the writer Elizabeth Gilbert said so eloquently in her brilliant essay on writing: ""Don't pre-reject yourself"". Let the HN market and community evaluate what you have to say. More frequently, however, it's more likely the comment will just exponentially fall down the page, below the active fold. In real life, I constipate my self expression, even with friends. Not so much here - and it feels great - to be able to express and to semi-anonymously connect with the HN community. And the times offline I just spontaneously go up to a group of strangers and connect with them are the best. Approval seeking is the opposite of sexy. Kind of like karma seeking. And, if your karma is high enough and/or you don't care about it, it doesn't affect you. And your karma will probably increase because you truly don't care. Life lesson there - substitute with fears and confidence building.<p>Don't hold back - please unleash your voice. Submit stories. Sometimes you get only a few upvotes and I like to think that you were able to connect someone to something they didn't know about. And that is the power of HN. A community of connectors. Even if it's just a link, you never know where that link may end up. It could be passed along until it provides an insight, a technique, a bit of value to the end receiver.<p>The counterpoint. I can't tell you how many times a comment being upvoted many times has affected my mood when it's been an otherwise mundane day. Especially when I dash off a quick comment and hours later see it's been upvoted to the mesosphere. Nothing is black and white, I guess. But the point here is - the higher the karma goes, the less it matters.<p><a href=""http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/writing.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/writing.htm</a>",1274088514

1353910,comment,1352728,1353049,0,0,tewks,,,"First off, the ""another failed phone OS"" comment is ridiculous. webOS is largely what HP was interested in.  It's been developed in a few years by a fairly small team and has obviously added a significant amount of value to the company and the resulting sale price.  It seems like a great OS to use; I don't own a palm device.  Both critically and financially it has been a success.<p>This whole discussion is speculation...  Once can objectively state that RIM is pretty far behind in delivering a modern mobile OS, even those targeting enterprise customers.  I didn't even mention the fact that application development for the platform is somewhat of a nightmare, something that will be increasingly important to a CIO.<p>Regardless, arguably, the consumer market is in fact a lot more important to the company both today and going forward than you've made note of.  Look at the company's marketing material: it is generally centered around media playback or BBM.<p>Buying Palm, porting BBM to WebOS, and slapping the Blackberry logo onto the Pre and Pixi would be a pretty easy way to improve their position in the consumer market.",1274087936

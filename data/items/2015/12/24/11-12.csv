I probably loved it because at the time I&#x27;d already been experimenting with compiler writing for 5-6 years, and it gave me a theoretical grounding for a lot of stuff I&#x27;d been doing or doing subtly &quot;wrong&quot;.<p>I think it - and similar books - should be banished from first compiler classes, and instead be used later. Much more practical books like Wirth&#x27;s that actually walk you through writing a compiler would be much better for most beginners.",1450958324

10787901,comment,10785716,10787797,0,0,spotman,,,"One way to think about this that maybe overlaps with the theme of this article, but also stands on its own with specific regard to database modifications is that you often need to have the ability to have multiple versions of everything alive at one point in time.<p>So maybe that&#x27;s a schema A and a schema B, or maybe you have applied schema B which only app version 1.1 is optimized for , but version 1.0 is what is in production immediately following your database migration. So you can&#x27;t make changes in schema B that would immediately render app 1.0 broken, which means you need to not box yourself into a corner with future assumptions as much as possible.<p>Ultimately if downtime is not an option you end up writing these capabilities in at every layer.  Whether it&#x27;s an api endpoint or code talking to a database you often have to make carefully thought out changes incrementally to ensure that things can all operate simultaneously, and often this ends up having metadata about the versions of everything as an option for taking different code paths.<p>This article touches on this in the way that if suggests making your app deal with an available database and one that is not available.  Same with a field in a schema or a payload.  To make your code less brittle instruct it what to do in both cases.",1450958229

10787888,comment,10778946,10787561,0,0,lmm,,,"> The point I was trying to make is the decoupling between cluster size and F. ZK, for example, requires that the cluster size is exactly 2F+1, not is minimum 2F+1. That means that as the cluster size increases, performance will decrease as more nodes have to be contacted.<p>How does this work? Suppose we set F=2 and have 7 nodes, A-G. Client 1 tries to write, contacting 5 nodes, A-E. A and B are down at this point, but C, D and E accept the write so it calls it good. Then A and B come up and C and D go down. Client 2 tries to read, contacting nodes A, B, C, F, G. 4 out of the 5 respond successfully, so it calls it good. But it can&#x27;t possibly read the value that client 1 wrote.<p>Whatever way you do it, the number of nodes contacted for a write + number of nodes contacted for a read has to add up to more than the cluster size. If your cluster is somehow sharded then you can work around this with e.g. consistent hashing (so that client 2 knows which 5 of the 7 nodes a particular key must be stored on, and contacts the correct subset), but that only works if client 2 can know what the key was - and I think Cassandra already supports that.",1450957666

10787882,comment,10773666,10782010,0,0,Houshalter,,,"Well chairs really are different than software. Most of the value of a chair comes from the labor and resources put into producing it.<p>Software takes 0 effort and 0 resources to produce more copies. All of the cost comes from the initial development. The actual disks or bandwidth for downloads costs pennies.<p>So when you sell a chair, you aren&#x27;t decreasing the quality of future chairs in any way. Fewer chairs bought, just means there will be fewer chairs made the next year. Maybe a single chair maker will lose his job. Which sucks for him. But he really isn&#x27;t needed because the world doesn&#x27;t need <i>more</i> chairs.<p>With software, less demand means less quality. When you get less sales, then the budget for the next video game will be less and less. Fewer niche games will be made because the budget gets too small to support them.<p>Even though the demand is theoretically there - there are enough gamers willing to spend money on such a game to support it. The problem is it creates a free rider problem where no one wants to be the one to pay for it, when they can just free ride off of used games and not spend a dime.<p>Second, the very important difference is time sensitivity. Games get the majority of their sales in the first month, and it slowly declines after that. If everyone sells used, then all of the sales after the first month don&#x27;t matter. So the vast majority of their income is lost.",1450957582

Much of what&#x27;s new in the paper is about <i>hardware</i> issues, especially because it&#x27;s concerned with firmware attacks that are already being used by attackers like NSA, and that other people clearly understand how to develop in principle.<p>With these firmware attacks, compromising a device at one point in time may allow the compromise to persist even if the user reinstalls the OS or replaces it with a different one.<p>One way to see this paper is as a response to<p><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/hashdays/why-johnny-cant-tell-if-he-is-compromised"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/hashdays/why-johnny-cant-tell-if-h...</a><p>proposing more details of a safer future platform.<p>Right now, someone who can briefly get kernel-level control on a machine intended to run your OS might be able to reprogram the hard drive firmware. At that point you have a serious authenticity challenge when booting your OS, because the hard drive can alter the contents of particular binaries at the moment they&#x27;re read from disk. There are some powerful software-only defenses against this, but if an attacker knows which ones you use, they can probably design an attack that evades those.",1450957425
10787875,comment,10786842,10787836,0,0,vidarh,,,"Thanks for the recommendation, though I&#x27;d give the caveat that I&#x27;ve been rambling all over the place, especially in the later parts. I also have lots of changes after the latest part that I need to write about...<p>I&#x27;d really like to get a chance to take the time to retrospectively go over and tighten it up. The trouble with that is that it&#x27;s easily 10 times+ as much effort to follow along with a project this way and write about each change as it is to cover the finished code (especially thorny issues such as how to avoid wasting too much time on bug fixes that may or may not have affected understanding of previous parts).<p>Personally, while I&#x27;m very happy that people find my series useful, I&#x27;d recommend perhaps supplementing or starting with Niklaus Wirth&#x27;s books or Crenshaws &quot;Let&#x27;s write a compiler&quot; (one of the ones recommended in the linked artile) for something much more focused. I feel the angles are sufficiently different that it&#x27;s worth it. And Wirth is my big hero when it comes to language and compiler construction.<p>While the other suggestion in the article is well worth a read, I&#x27;d give one caveat: Lots of passes is <i>hard</i> to keep mental track of. My compiler sort-of does something similar in applying multiple transformation stages to the AST, and I&#x27;m mulling collapsing it into fewer stages rather than more because I feel it&#x27;s getting more complex than necessary. You can work around some of the debugging complexity by outputting each stage to a suitable format so you can test each transformation individually, but it&#x27;s still hard to keep track of exactly what each\nstage expects and delivers.",1450957369

I predict that eventually future processors will hide more features from the higher software levels (such as number of registers, instruction types and formats) in order to improve efficiency at the machine level.

3365,comment,3264,3336,0,0,notabel,,,"Looking at old comments[1], though, indicates that the overall volume of karma flow was much higher in the early days.  Of course, it could be that the bug-driven hyperkarma on posts led users to be more generous with karma on comments.<p>[1] In particular, the feature request thread.",1173490884
3364,comment,1085,1774,0,0,notabel,,,"I run into this problem all the time--not good for diminishing by reload-addiction!  It would be nice if pages included some js to rewrite history[1] via dom, so that we could always see the freshest versions of pages.<p>[1] It pains me to advocate breaking the ""show me exactly what I was just seeing"" semantics of the back button, but I think in this case the user clearly conceives the back button as ""show me the abstract resource I was just seeing.""

3362,comment,3348,3357,0,0,amichail,,,"The problem is that PageRank puts you in a mindset of creating sophisticated algorithms that are much more resistant to spam than naive approaches. In that sense, it discourages people from even trying out social apps.",1173490486
3361,comment,363,481,0,0,notabel,,,"More important, I think, than displaying the number of new comments is making it possible to /find/ them.  The reordering of comments is usually a great thing, but in a relatively involved discussion, it can become quite a chore to find that new comment.<p>I'm not sure what the best way to implement it would be, from either an algorithmic or HCI standpoint, but it certainly would be nice if you could come up with a way to make new comments stand out in threads.  (Preferably with new defined by when the user last viewed the page, rather than being a static global definition.)",1173490460

3358,comment,3348,3357,0,0,amichail,,,"I don't think it's obvious at all that you can control spam in a social app such as wikipedia or social bookmarking. You need to try it out and see what happens.",1173489708
3357,comment,3348,3352,0,0,danielha,,,"If it's on the web, spam will always be a possibility. I don't see people getting discouraged from creating networks due to spam. Any quarter-decent social application will have some measures for dealing with it.<p>Most social applications aren't aiming for the PageRank either. Their use is grown through word of mouth approaches, not organic search. What aspect of PageRank is doing this discouraging of social apps? ",1173489586
3356,comment,3171,3301,0,0,jwecker,,,"What sets this site apart for pg is that he can use it to guage peoples comments for when they apply for something.  One thing that sets this site apart for me, though, is that I think most people here intend to meet one another in person at some point, sooner or later.  That makes a big difference in the feel of the place.  Using first names in posts, not acting like children in our debates, a real desire (from the first day in the feature request discussion) to see what other people look like and know what they're really up to, etc.",1173489291

3352,comment,3348,3350,0,0,amichail,,,"After seeing what PageRank can do in terms of controlling spam, VCs would be reluctant to fund a startup that is much more prone to spamming (e.g., something like wikipedia, social bookmarking, etc.). So one might argue that PageRank has in fact discouraged people from even thinking about social apps for a long time.\n",1173488761

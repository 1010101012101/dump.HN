But in the case of old prints, I see your point.<p>Long term, I hope this is self-correcting.  People still like vinyl, and although you can't find a Tower Records anywhere on earth, you can find vinyl shops that are still doing really well.  The same could end up being true for film-projecting theaters.<p>My bias for digital probably clouds my judgment now so I have a question:  would you be interested to see these on film if you could see a cleaned up, perfect, version on a 4K+ digital projector?  What about the film version appeals to you?",1339649983

Also do not use floats to position everything, only elements that need to flow with the contents of the document.  Use position absolute for elements that are static and of course in the block that holds said elements add position relative.

4109848,comment,4109486,4109486,1,0,LocalPCGuy,,,"This would not work.  The problem isn't a solution that requires a NEW prefix, but one that there is a ton of information and implementations ALREADY EXISTING that use the -webkit- prefix.  Those devs that were too lazy or uninformed to include -moz- or any other prefixes (sometimes even the unprefixed version at all) are not going to go back and update all of their prefixes to -x- now.  We don't need more prefixes.<p>A better solution would be for browser vendors to state that prefixes would only work in alpha/beta browsers, but would be removed from production browsers.  That would allow testing, but remove the temptation to use the prefixes in production code.  Alas, the standards committee can't keep up with the changes that are required for the browser manufacturers to feel safe doing so, and it could introduce the risk of features landing unprefixed that use different implementations if the manufacturers ignore the standards.",1339649947

But instead he offers a positively <i>insane</i> rationale for making it closed-source that may as well be ""Cthulhu wills it so! Ph'nglui mglw'nafh!"" That makes me extremely wary of this software.

Google's pre-WWDC event has made it clear they are developing their own iOS app. I don't know if they'll charge for it (that would be an interesting angle, even if they just charged for turn-by-turn), but there will be something.<p>2. There is a theory going around that these aren't the real maps Apple intends on launching in the fall - this is just the test data they're willing to show at this point (perhaps to lull competitors like Google into a false sense of security). I don't know if I buy that, but it would be consistent with their culture of secrecy.<p>3. I think the biggest problem for Apple is actually the missing mass transit directions. So far they've talked about third party apps taking care of that, but I suspect that won't cut it ""for real"". Perhaps they have something up their sleeve, or perhaps they just plan to buy the best third-party app, but if not... it will be a big win for Google in cities, especially outside the US (where mass transit is much, much bigger). I don't think Apple is likely to make that mistake, though I wouldn't be shocked if they ended up correcting the problem in response to feedback. On the other hand, it is just barely possible that the key decisionmakers might be that little bit too US-centric. If so...",1339649591

The guards in Zimbardo's experiment were thus coerced by Zimbardo and his researchers to brutalize the prisoners; while the prisoners did not simply submit to the guards' brutality, but instead, actively resisted their oppression, both collectively and individually.

(DRM just makes this worse.)  I've got some weird routing to my TV because the obvious HDMI connection doesn't work, and how do you troubleshoot that?<p>I once went to a theatre where the projectionist came out and announced that they had just broken a lens (apparently they had the largest lenses in town at the time) and couldn't project the film as they wanted to.  They offered a refund, but for those who stayed, let us vote on what to do: use a smaller lens and see the film normally but smaller, or use the proper size lens but put up with 3-4 minute pauses every 20 minutes.  Everyone stayed, and we chose the latter (who wants to see a small movie in a theatre?), and I don't think it was the <i>wrong</i> choice, but I learned that changeovers are not like commercial breaks: some of them are in really inconvenient places in the film, plot-wise!<p>That's a situation that could never happen with a new digital projection system.  The odd thing is that even though we groaned at how poorly-timed the changeovers were, in my mind the whole event is an overwhelmingly positive memory.  I learned something about how projection systems work, and we got to interact with the projectionist, and it was a unique movie night we got to talk about, and I even enjoyed the movie still.  We sometimes act as though the only goal of cinema is to reproduce every pixel and soundwave perfectly, but my most enjoyable movie experiences don't correlate to that, and in this case is almost the polar opposite.<p>I suppose I'm a bit weird like that.",1339646768

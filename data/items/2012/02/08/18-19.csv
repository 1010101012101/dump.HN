The solution is simple: if a windows device with a locked bootloader is not acceptable, don't buy it.  Buy android devices with open bootloaders if you want freedom to do whatever with your hardware. Moreso, buy Lemote Yeelong to guarantee the hardware specs will be open enough to adapt any OS to work on it.<p>ARM devices should be scrutinized because not only is Windows adopting them, but OS X also (# 1 & 2 consumer OSs). x86 requirements should be monitored also, just in case the following does not occur.<p><a href=""http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/02/07/apple_intern_thesis_leaks_secret_project_to_port_mac_os_x_to_arm_processors.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/02/07/apple_intern_t...</a>\n<a href=""http://semiaccurate.com/2011/05/05/apple-dumps-intel-from-laptop-lines/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://semiaccurate.com/2011/05/05/apple-dumps-intel-from-la...</a>",1328727594

If they can, good, but, if the can't, that's not such a big deal. If, however, the device and its software are not seamlessly integrated, like most Android-based phones, demands to be able to change the software start to appear. It will be easy to see the devices all run a single OS made by someone else. In that case, demand to be able to install something else - since hardware and software were not designed to one another - is natural. What Microsoft is doing is trying to limit user choice because they see the threat of non-Microsoft OSs in the tablet market.

Education is important, but always second to financial literacy. People turn out poor because theyre not taught financial literacy.<p>The first one is apparent. I definitely agree that his books, especially the later titles are scammy. However they are not completely without any value. Kiyosaki is more like a motivational guru than a finance expert. I think the message that it's better to produce than to consume is pretty successfully conveyed.<p>3) >Pay yourself first. Even if the government comes knocking on your door, you deserve to be paid first. The best way to do this, in Kiyosakis opinion, is to hide under the umbrella of a corporation. The author fails to recognize the difference between business expenses and personal expenses.<p>I admit that this is bad advice, but for different reasons. It's something I wouldn't do myself, because it isn't ethical and not because it's not effective. Chances are if you're making below 500k, you can get away with this tactic. Even if the IRS does audit you, there are just so many ways to still make it out alive. (One of my friends used to work for a law firm specializing in taxes.)",1328726725

Transporters are used as weapons in Atlantis to beam in big ol' bombs until the enemy eventually works out what's happening and how to prevent it. In some ways you can still tell it's ultimately a Star Trek sequel, but they did a reasonable job of thinking it through much better.<p>It also doesn't suffer from ""Cool Technology in one episode -> never heard from again"" syndrome, to give another example of an improvement over Star Trek.<p>If you've never watched it, I recommend it. It sort of dies with a whimper rather than a bang (opinions on the spinoffs are mixed), but SG-1 was very good for a very long time. Mainlining the first season episodes without commercials and in sequence is really a spectacular experience if you can stomach the ""time wastiness"". The first couple of seasons in particular really captured the sense of humans being thrust extremely suddenly into a new, huge universe without guides very well.",1328724757

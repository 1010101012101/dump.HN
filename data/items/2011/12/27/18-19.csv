I'm glad that she didn't get seriously injured or harassed or locked up for several days.  From what I can tell, once they got her isolated she was treated very well.  But it was dangerous.  As far as I'm concerned, once you step into an airport (especially an american airport) you are no longer a citizen of any particular country and have no rights.<p>Unfortunately, she did not simply read the constitution.  She yelled it out loud so that others could hear, thereby causing quite a disturbance.  Several times she mentioned that people were staring and I imagine all security processing had come to a halt at that point.  I think they had no choice but to remove her from the area because of the disturbance.  Also, if somebody nearby was planning on doing something, she would have created the perfect time to do it.  She could have become an accomplice in a serious crime.<p>I agree with all of the statements she was yelling out, and it is unfortunate that things have come to this.  But please be careful when considering this kind of action.  Especially if you have loved ones at home who are going to worry about you.",1325012314

This clutters the application code.  So you can't simply take a program written to run on a GC platform and move it to a reference counting platform unmodified.<p>Alternatively, you could use both: do most of your reclamation with reference counting, but throw in an occasional GC to collect circular structures.  CPython, the most commonly used Python implementation, does this.  I doubt it is the best thing for performance, but CPython isn't very fast anyway.",1325011865

You don't really want the reputation of releasing a device that's cheap because it's crappy, rather than cheap because it's limited.<p>From a customer's point of view, for $200 they expect a smaller screen, less storage, less features, less ability to run the latest games. They do not expect less fit and finish. See the car industry for an example.

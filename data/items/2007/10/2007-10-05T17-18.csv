63684,comment,63437,63437,0,0,tx,,,"It's always easier to criticize. The problem is that space travel is very, very, very hard. In that regard the Cold War was the best thing that ever happened to space exploration: two super powers spending crazy amount of money and human effort to beat each other 'who's gonna do THAT first?'. I think it was awesome: the best kind of competition you can have, almost like a high school science contest on a giant scale.<p>If you look around at other countries in the ""space club"" the situation is not much different. Launching 1gk of <i>anything</i> so high is so expensive that it makes very little economic sense. Private sector will never launch anything to Mars. Why would they? Private investors would never build a giant space station just to run a bunch of experiments on it. <p>The main message this article is trying to send is a bit creepy one (IMO): ""NASA, you should do some kick-ass research using our tax dollars, and we'll be trying to make money out of what you will come up with"". The problem with it is that only small percentage of what can be done in space is profitable: satellites, high-altitude tourism... that's about it. <p>",1191606380

63676,comment,63617,63621,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"Recently, a friend of a friend introduced me to a young man who is developing some interesting software.  REALLY interesting stuff.  During the demo I was floored at how much more advanced it was than anything currently on the web.  The young man's presentation panache was second to none as well.  You see, he went to his website on MY MacBook demonstrating at once his confidence in his virtual world platform's ability to run in arbitrary browsers, AND the fact that it supports MacOSX without stating it!  Who IS this kid!?!? I thought.<p>I am ashamed to say that I was shocked.  Oh the software he described was straight forward enough.  Though admittedly my eyes did glaze over during his explanation of some of the algorithms behind his system.  This type of minutia was NOT something I needed to know.  A simple ""This demos our booty physics"" engine is fine, I get it.<p>What REALLY got me, yes even SHOCKED me, was the fact that all of this was coming from a person who, if I saw he and his friends on the street, would probably have prompted me to double check my car locks.  Maybe that is a little bit of an exaggeration but you get the idea.  How does a black kid, t-shirt, necklace, sweatpants and all, understand these technologies so well?  Now before you call me racist, realize that this kid had been shopping around a LOT.  Even so, I am the ONLY person, so far, to have invited him to give a presentation.  At least I gave him a chance, and I am ecstatic that I did!<p>As I have too much respect for a lot of people on these boards to sport with your intellect any longer than necessary I will come to the point.  Though, being so intelligent, I am certain that for many of you I have already made it.  How does this young man, with intelligence, ambition, and persistence, become successful in our society if ""a company should be able to hire or fire whomever they like for whatever reason""?  Attitudes like that are what leave him, and others like him, on the outside looking in most of the time now.  I believe that we live in a society with a color-blind ideal.  I also believe that MANY young men, like the young man in my story, suffer due to our failure to live up to it.<p>As do women.<p>As do the aged.",1191605577
63674,comment,62519,62557,0,0,geebee,,,"Oh yeah,  his won't work for all fields.  Iterative development is excellent in software because the cost of construction (ie., running the code) is nearly zero.  You can let constant feedback from application guide where you are going.<p>This is why interviewers like to ask about languages that aren't in the corporate playbook.  If someone says ""Ruby?  Python?  Lisp?  No, I haven't had the opportunity to use any of those yet,"" you know you can pass.  Not because all good programmers use ruby, python, and lisp, but because all good programmers know that you don't need to ""have the opportunity"", you just need to install the language and write some code.  <p>It would be unconscionable to learn brain surgery this way, so if someone says ""I haven't had the opportunity to operate on a brain yet,"" that's a reasonable statement.  <p>I actually suspect that writing software is one of the most complicated things a person can do.  If we didn't have the advantage of iterative development with cheap compile cycles (or run cycles, if you don't compile), then no system of any real complexity could be built.  ",1191605442

What about suing investors for the cost of equity capital being too high for companies with CEOs of color?

63666,comment,63617,63661,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"It is an entirely different story under government run operations, such as your school example.  The answer to this, in my opinion, would be not to have the schools run by the government in the first place.  This would lead to schools, in those days, that were ""white"" only and ""black"" only.  But it would have opened the door to the school entrepreneurs who only cared about providing the best education value and to profit from that. And to be really successful in that context would argue against being racist and excluding half of the potential students.  Of course, in those days, racism was culturally embedded, but this would not have stopped the ""black"" entrepreneurs from creating high value schools that would have given students a big advantage down the road, and potentially in other less racist locations.<p>An interesting note is that racism in a modern culture seems to be inversely proportional to prosperity in that culture.  Look at Mississippi and Alabama in the US, the Middle East, etc.  It is hard to be innovative and successful when your mind is warped into a racist mode.",1191604671

63658,comment,63009,63009,0,0,swards,,,"Can't agree with the ""Younger, nerdier founders"" section.<p>It's like any other long tail, in this case the prototypical founder (late 20', single, technical guy) will not be as common - it'll become a more-diverse population.  There will be younger founders and there will be older founders, too.  Nerdier, and hipper.  Etc.<p>For example, I'm a 40 yo front-end developer (started in 1995 building interactive apps at ESPN).  I'm now starting a company, doing all the backend development too, thanks to Ruby on Rails.  This was never available to me before 2006, really.<p>My bet - the trend will be away from the core developers, as the back end tools become commoditized and packaged, and the prized employees will become the designers - UI and graphical.  Brands and positioning will start to play a larger part, and these contributors will have the most to say about this part of the company.  I predict the trend will go away from the technical, as people will need to wear many hats in a small company.<p>As for the young, I don't believe they have an advantage in a crowded startup environment.  The lucky bet, or obvious missing younger-demographic website will be created by the kids, but this will happen less and less as the low-hanging fruit is gobbled up.  Instead, I think the older (or rather experienced) will have an advantage in a crowded startup world.  Here, it'll be the niche positioning, establishing business relationships, and pursuing effective growth strategies that will make the difference.",1191603692

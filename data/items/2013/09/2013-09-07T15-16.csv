It spreads like crazy. Second one is when a startup with less striking product comes, executes well, pivots a lot and steals networked users from established ones.<p>In all cases once a startup becomes dominant, it starts limiting and throttling their APIs fearing others obsoleting themselves. So the lesson, is to find a new grownup <i>startup</i>, which is not yet defensively throttling its platform or not yet pursuing ultimate monetization of its network.",1378569592

6345386,comment,6344192,6344591,3,0,distantparts,,,"In my experience, the animal updates and other recent changes definitely favour the big brands. My main car reviews site (established 1997) was hammered by Panda, and has never recovered, while the big brands I competed with have been left untouched, despite having content that is often lower quality.<p>While I think Google has done a really poor job of helping smaller sites who&#x27;ve been unfairly hit by these changes, I don&#x27;t think there is anything underhand going on. I just think Google decided to tune their algorithms to minimise the number of bad results they show.<p>They appear to be happy with results that favour big brands that they trust, while excluding most of the worst content farms, even though the cost of that is potentially failing to deliver high quality results from smaller sites. I&#x27;m sure they have user satisfaction statistics that justify this trade-off they&#x27;re making. No malevolence or greed is required from Google in this scenario.<p>In the short term, this is probably good for Google&#x27;s users, but in the long term, it&#x27;s creating a two tier web, where new entrants will find it more difficult than they should to compete with established brands.<p>p.s. There seems to be a similar tradeoff made in terms of newer pages being favoured over older, more relevant pages. It makes sense in some cases (news for example), but in my view, the newness signal is too strong at the moment, and it&#x27;s hurting the quality of their search results.",1378569386

However, this cloud labor is for unskilled work.<p>So yes, they are commodities, but if they are a lot of them, and a lot of work to go around, wages rise. We saw this with the industrial revolution, especially assembly lines. Mid 20th century you could live pretty well as an unskilled assembly line worker, but then the work dried up.<p>Most modern work, knowledge work, hasn&#x27;t been turned into assembly line yet. Many would argue that&#x27;s because it can&#x27;t be, but I disagree with that, much of enterprise software is about turning it into that (workflows,processes). It just requires more of the same. There are actually very few cloud labor startups (mturk, crowdflower, mobilworks) with at most a 100 programmers, one reason being that it doesn&#x27;t have the network effects moat that VC&#x27;s look for.

6345374,comment,6344649,6345176,4,0,bhauer,,,"Precisely!  If there is any silver-lining to the NSA revelations (and there really is not a silver-lining, I&#x27;m just using it as a figure of speech), it is that the pendulum is swinging back to self-control of data and applications.  I&#x27;ve for several years wanted to see a post-cloud model where an application and data host I control runs singular application instances for me and all my devices are merely views on those applications [1].  I call it personal application omnipresence, and the &quot;personal&quot; aspect is of chief importance.<p>I see the current configuration of Internet services--what I call the &quot;plain cloud&quot;--to be a frustrating diversion, and one that passively or actives suppresses the &quot;personal&quot; aspect of applications.  As Amadou points out, the plain cloud is facile because businesses can easily be intermediaries.  <i>Oh, it&#x27;s so difficult to connect an always-on, secure, and self-controlled host to the Internet to share your photos with family and friends?  Don&#x27;t worry!  We&#x27;ll handle that for you.  Oh and look, we also get all of your photos and data.  But don&#x27;t you worry, we&#x27;re good people.  Trust us.</i><p>For years, it has irked me that so many have voluntarily forfeited control of their data and applications out of convenience when alternative models that would provide convenience without sacrificing control are fairly easy to conceive.  With equal R&D effort as the plain cloud has seen, these alternatives could be realized.<p>I was angry when Google made their terms of service for Google Fiber disallow home servers.  I imagine Amadou was as well.  (I don&#x27;t have Google Fiber, but I want it or something similar with reasonable TOS.)  Preventing home servers is just perpetuating the current narrow vision of centralized hosting, and that notion is overdue for disruption.  Obviously that&#x27;s favorable to Google, but I don&#x27;t really care about what&#x27;s good for Google.<p>Data centers in general should fear symmetric gigabit+ to the home.  I know that without a doubt if I had fiber to my home, I would pull my servers out of my data center immediately and put a rack in my garage.<p>I want self-hosting demystified and mainstreamed.  As the pendulum swings back to self-control, anyone who is working to make &quot;self-hosting&quot; synonymous with today&#x27;s popular verb, &quot;sharing&quot; is posed to earn my business.  The model should be embraced by open source advocates.  I even suggest Microsoft should leverage the building momentum and be the first industry titan to champion disintermediating the plain cloud [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/pao"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/pao</a> [2] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/microsoft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/microsoft</a>",1378568997

6345368,story,,,160,117,jophde,"Ask HN: How to best acquire theoretical computer science knowledge?",,"I didn&#x27;t know what I wanted to do before going to college at Penn State. I just knew that I had to go to college.  I was always interested computers so I ended majoring in Information Sciences and Technology.  About halfway through when I actually got to take some programming classes I discovered that I had a passion for software.  I went to my counselor and inquired about switching over to CS.  Unfortunately, almost nothing from my major would transfer and I had to pretty much start over.  As someone paying for college myself this really wasn&#x27;t an option.  I continued on with IST in the Design and Development option.<p>I ended becoming the first employee at Bay Area startup.  They were a bit desperate and I convinced them I could make their Android apps.  I did and they are both highly rated.  I also made one of my own that ended up getting featured on Google Play and receiving a lot of press.  I have a bit of knack for it but I am so bored with GUIs and UIs.  I want to work on harder problems and not just use other peoples libraries.  The problem is that my lack of knowledge limits my thinking.  I want to fix this.  I am torn between going back to school for another BS in CS, pursuing a MS in CS, or teaching myself from things like MIT Open Courseware and Udacity.<p>I am not really worried about getting a job.  This is about gaining knowledge.  Although having a &quot;real&quot; CS would certainly help keep me from being pigeon holed as an app developer and open a few more doors.  I do think that going back to school would be the quickest route to gaining the knowledge I want.  I am just worried that I wouldn&#x27;t get into a top school and I don&#x27;t know if I should try to do a BS, MS, or just take classes.  I really don&#x27;t want another $50k in debt either.  Especially when things like the Georgia Tech online MS CS is coming out for $7k.<p>So, what is the best way for a proven and largely self taught developer to take their knowledge to the next level?",1378568670

First it&#x27;s worth quoting the rest of that paragraph:<p>&quot;The investigators discovered that given a chance, and in the presence of a low-fat diet, bacteria from a lean twin will take over the gut of a mouse that already had bacteria from a fat twin. The fat mouse then loses weight. But the opposite does not happen. No matter what the diet, bacteria from a fat mouse do not take over in a mouse that is thin.&quot;<p>Second, the context (described later in the article) is among co-habitating mice that eat each other&#x27;s droppings, allowing their gut flora to commingle. When the mice were kept separate, the mice that had received gut flora from a fat human twin ended up 10-15% heavier even on the identical low-fat diet as the mice that received flora from a thin human.<p>(Aside, because it&#x27;s personal: I have no trouble controlling my weight through diet and exercise. When I ate poorly and exercised little I was as heavy as 190 lbs. With exercise and being mindful about my diet I have no trouble maintaining 150 lbs. My wife, otoh, has struggled with her weight almost her entire life. To lose weight she has to weigh and track every ounce of food she consumes. It is a constant battle for her. Sadly, I see this dichotomy playing out in our son and daughter. My son will never struggle with his weight; I fear my daughter always may. And we eat well in this house. Real food, mostly plants, not too much.<p>So yeah, I think some people are thin almost no matter what they eat, some struggle with weight almost no matter what they do, and some are more in between.

You write 3 Mb of source code filled with unit tests, does that give you any guarantee the program will even start when you call it ? (A point of frustration that I have had with other developers is that they deliver &quot;a product&quot;, which immediately sigsevs upon execution, and then claim that&#x27;s not possible, all tests pass. Same with memory leaks, which are <i>never</i> caught by unit tests, not in C++ and not in Java either).<p>First thing to do is to get the program having a backend and a frontend separately, then introduce a system test. Something that does what the main customer(s) do with your application, and does it while seriously stressing the system. You need it to send out mails ? Make it send out 10000000 mails while only using the backend calls the webserver calls while activating a sleep(1) in the mock database routines, and impose a memory limit of half a gig, checking if memory usage actually drops when you stop pushing the application. Make it use an actual database, and make it send actual emails to a fake &quot;smarthost&quot; email server. If it doesn&#x27;t complete in 5 minutes, something is wrong. I&#x27;ve been meaning to implement this test atop docker. I tried to generate VMs to test the full application, start the app in a simulated network and run most of the actual production code, but making the VMs took ~25 minutes (and they weren&#x27;t even on the correct machine by then), which made it unusable. I wonder if docker can do better.<p>Yes this test will be flaky, yes if it does indicate failure figuring out what&#x27;s wrong is bloody hard, yes it means abandoning several holy cows of software development, yes it means some program will tell you where to focus attention, yes it will force you to actually think about debugging production failures BEFORE shipping, it forces you to have test systems for the program&#x27;s components, it generally makes you deal with reality. You will have discussions with this test if you do it right (&quot;No that hash-table MUST be faster than that linked list ! Aaaargh !&quot;). And that is something sorely needed in software development.<p>Second thing I use this for. Boss-man wants a new feature. Ok, sure. I add a system test that uses it. Needless to say, it will fail. But it allows me to have a good think about what the high-level changes needed are, without unit tests constantly badgering me that some method now accepts different parameters. It will tell me if I got it right. And when I deliver it, the freaking program will start, and won&#x27;t crash the first time someone uses this feature. You tell me how to make unit tests that deliver 10% of those guarantees. Forgot the big picture after spending 2-3 hours on getting a module fixed after adding new functionality to it ? Just single step through the system test and see where it blows up, and hey. There&#x27;s the next thing needed for the high-level change.<p>Unit test programmers are terminally afraid of changing module interfaces to suit higher-level objectives. Given the amount of unit tests needed to even approach 95% coverage, I fully understand the resistance. But if they choose to write unit tests and I need the module change, I just go in and do it, disabling the unit tests. I tend to get some attitude in code reviews.<p>It also means that replacing the database with something else is something you can just do in an afternoon. Changing the core logic of the system, from a set of rules to a rule interpreter ? Changing that rule interpreter to jython ? No problem, the test will tell you if common use cases of your product are actually still working. And that&#x27;s what the business/boss (should) care about.<p>Ops will love you if you do this. You will consistently deliver a working product that operates well within known parameters, as opposed to a system where the tiny wheels all turn, just not in the same direction.<p>Unit tests optimize for the wrong thing : they make sure programmers&#x27; jobs become easy, because the modules behave the way they &quot;should&quot;, and can be changed with &quot;predictable&quot; results, which of course turn out not to be predictable in the real world. Furthermore the interactions between the &quot;should&quot;s of multiple modules ... turn out to be less than simple. Unit tests allow you to say &quot;not my fault&quot; (e.g. if your method is merely slow, but suddenly gets called billions of times because some other system changed and makes the system suddenly crash when too much is going on, but not due to a logic error). They make it easy to change systems by only touching the smallest components, which of course also massively limits the changes possible in a system.<p>Unit tests impose strong limitations on the changes that you can make to code (in reasonable time). Therefore, for the large majority of code, they are a burden, not a boon. There is one (big) exception. Algorithm and data structure code should be thoroughly unit tested. In most projects however, you have maybe 2-3 methods that fall into that category. If you have more, find an open source project to replace 50% of them, or figure out how to use more general data structures to do your thing.",1378567284

Prime Minister Churchill certainly did need to be careful about what actions he took based on ULTRA decrypts so as to avoid revealing the activities of Bletchley Park. Coventry is the quotable example despite not actually happening the way the story is told.<p>However if you require an example that actually happened, consider when Adm. Nimitz received message intelligence pointing out Adm. Yamamoto&#x27;s flight itinerary.<p>In his case he ended up using a literal example of parallel construction (having a coastwatcher send a report of a Japanese flight) to generate a non-codebreaking reason for his staff to know about the flight, and then sent out his fighter planes to shoot Yamamoto&#x27;s flight down.<p>> (2) The NSA is way out of line in this respect and no matter how much they do/did it that stands and you should not apologize for it.<p>With respect to things like DEA I would agree with you. But on the other hand if they came across a no-shit email from a hitman or something describing an upcoming murder I would expect them to report it.<p>It may be that it&#x27;s impossible to write a policy that straddles that border, in which case I&#x27;d say we should probably ban that type of information sharing and then rely on the idea that an analyst who sees that type of murder plot might still leave an anonymous tip.<p>> The balance here is not to get to perfect security without privacy, the balance point is to get to an optimal level of security with a maximum of privacy.<p>Hey look at that, we fully agree!",1378566587

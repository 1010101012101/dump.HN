What? Buying fake Syrian passports is what many of the migrants have done to get priority benefits. It&#x27;s very normal among migrants, ISIS-loving or not. It&#x27;d be like saying a Sinaloa Cartel murderer using someone else SSN is trying to shut down the US-Mexico border. ISIS has been very vocal about sending thousands of soldiers abroad to kill. They have said, too, that they hope to provoke an anti-Muslim backlash that improves their recruiting. But ISIS is a nation state and a religion—it needs to be able to claim victory no matter how Europe reacts, just as a politician can never cleanly apologize or admit fault.",1447607087
10570168,comment,10566855,10569979,0,0,sethrin,,,"That article was a fairly factless rant. To my mind, while there may be good reasons to avoid FPLs, that article doesn&#x27;t present any. It reads like it was written by an angry non-technical co-founder, and its use of images was more appropriate to Buzzfeed than HN. There are certainly more businesses where an army of mediocre Java or PHP programmers are sufficient to keep a piece of software in a useful state than there are environments where you need FPLs, but blanket condemnation is not really worth the time it takes to read. Also, equating a $60k PHP dev and a $150k Haskell dev is likely to be a serious error. And of course, describing FPLs as Turing Tarpits is indefensible.<p>In other words, there&#x27;s not much in that article to discuss.",1447607074

Nobody is saying it is impossible to have a startup in Europe -- there are startups in Europe, of course it is possible. The issue is that having a startup in Europe is far harder to start and harder to scale which means there are far less startups in Europe and to have a successful startup is a higher bar.<p>If this still isn&#x27;t clear, you can try comparing it to being a female tech founder in the 00s. It was possible and some people did it - but it was very challenging and there were more roadblocks making it difficult to succeed.

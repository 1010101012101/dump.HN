It takes much more effort to learn a language than to choose an obscure band to listen to.

2085558,comment,2085276,2085494,0,0,lsc,,,"in terms of stability?  really?<p>I hear this a lot about Python.   And I know a little bit about Python;  I know less about ruby.   But the thing of it is, from a SysAdmin perspective,  Python is where Perl was in 2000.   In 2000, you had differing versions of perl that were close enough to step on oneanother, but still so incompatible that you had to maintain one version of perl for your base OS tools, and usually another version of perl for every major application you used.<p>Perl has stabilized to the point where this is no longer a problem.  I can run nearly everything on system perl without worrying about it.   Python, on the other hand, I've had to wrangle with many RHEL systems that have two versions of python (one, because the RHEL base system requires a staggeringly ancient version of python, and then the other for the application the server was running.)<p>Python just isn't ""done"" in the way perl is.   In five or ten years, sure.   But for now, it's still a pain in the ass.<p>Hell, I'd bet money that at this point, perl5 has fewer memory leaks and other programming errors in the compiler than Ruby does, just because people have been pounding on it for so long.",1294585192

2085547,comment,2085388,2085388,0,0,kenjackson,,,"The thing with articles about this is that they seem to miss a few things:<p>1) Formal credentials don't exist in a vacuum.  They're meant to signal that you've done something.<p>2) OTJ training will be very effective for teaching someone the job.  In fact there was a time when it was expected that college grads would get OTJ training.  With that said, OTJ may not teach fundamentals applicable to many different jobs.<p>3) The argument of vocational training applies even earlier than college.  I'd argue that starting at age 14 it would yield practical results for the company.  But I think its even less of a good idea for the student at that age.  And note, although you earn a lot less money in college, there's something about college that multiplies the value of a dollar.<p>4) I'd argue that unless you're starting your own company, the ages from 17-21 are more enjoyable and reap greater benefit at most colleges than working.  Unless you truly dislike school or have a great idea, I'd put off working (and honestly, even if you had a great idea -- it's probably better working on that while in school, rather than employed).<p>In summary, I think Zoho's recruitment plan works well for the company, but less well for a fairly large class of students.",1294584755

Remi should have NEVER EVER sent that message. You guys should have come to agreement and worked with Apple as a team.<p>Fixing this is probably possible, but it requires cooperation from Rémi Denis-Courmont. You guys (here I say it again) will probably have to send a more formal letter to Apple to retract the initial complaint and then see if you can work together to fix this or to be more lenient and to simply say: we know this situation is not ideal, but thinking of millions of users who are using our software, we are going to let this happen anyway to see if we things can change in the longer term.",1294582930

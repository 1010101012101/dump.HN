Create a one-time-pad, or key.  This is a set of randomly chosen 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s.  Now, make a bitmap out of this data set, with 1 denoting a white pixel and 0 denoting a black pixel.  It will look like static.<p>2. Distribute a copy of the key to the person you are trying to communicate with via a secure channel.  (This is the hard part, security wise).<p>3. create your message as a black and white (not greyscale) image.  It should have the same dimensions as your key.<p>4. Pixel-wise XOR the key with the message. If the key was well randomized, the resulting cypher will also appear to be perfectly random static.<p>5. Send the cypher to the person who is holding the copy of the key.<p>6. When that person receives the cypher, if he XOR&#x27;s the cypher with the key, out will pop the original message!<p>The only visual difference to this method vs that in the linked article is that the message won&#x27;t start to show up when you&#x27;re a pixel or two out of alignment because there is no four-pixel subdivision. You have to line things up spot-on.<p>The Vernam cipher was originally published in 1926, so it&#x27;s defintely older than &quot;Visual Cryptography&quot;.  However, I don&#x27;t know if the visual demonstrations of it (I&#x27;ve only seen them in lectures, not surprisingly, with transparent overheads!), predate visual cryptography.  I&#x27;ve seen a couple of lecturers use this technique to demonstrate how a one-time-pad works and, crucially, why you can&#x27;t reuse keys more than once.<p>Does anyone know if this Visual Cryptography offers anything useful that a one time pad doesn&#x27;t?

Russians have really poor toothcare, and this is joined with non-smiling bidirectionally. There is nothing abnormal for Russian to have couple of missing teeth. I&#x27;ve seen a really rich people (for example owner of Rolls Royce fleet) with just a couple of yellow teeth left... man, you should never smile with this.<p>Also there is a lot of mimic signals except mouth area muscles tension, especially orbicularis oculi tension, that subconsciously telling that we are smiling. I&#x27;ve noticed that this secondary features is also less often for Russians relative to west and east Europeans. This is also true for voice tone and other subconscious traces of smile.

After reading this article, I immediately shared it on my Facebook wall before coming here to comment.<p>Some of the comments posted before this one express puzzlement about his &quot;homelessness&quot; when, after all, he had immediate relatives who still had a house to live in. Many cases of people living on the street are cases of people who have untreated behavior disorders that make them very hard to live with, even for their immediate relatives who have living space. The case of the author here is a case of a man who was brought up (as I am sure, having come from the same generation) to feel that it is his responsibility to provide for his children, and not their responsibility to provide for him. He used to live in Minnesota, where there is lethal cold outdoors during winter, but he was homeless in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, where it can feel cold at night but where the weather is liveable outdoors year-round. The author thought it was more dignified and honorable to live in a car or something else like that than to crash in his children&#x27;s housing.<p>On the whole, I&#x27;m very impressed by this man&#x27;s maturity of outlook and gracious recognition of other people&#x27;s point of view. He acknowledges, as several comments here have pointed out, that he made inexpedient career decisions. For a while, as he also acknowledges, he was &quot;married to his job,&quot; and didn&#x27;t give his wife enough encouragement and support as she brought up their children. He isn&#x27;t passing blame around, but accepting responsibility. He may be a failure in economic terms in recent years, but his attitude now is admirable and shows a capacity to grow and keep on learning in middle age.<p>Do any of us know what industry and what form of employment will be a sure thing twenty or thirty years from now? No. But we can be sure that life is full of surprises, which sometimes include setbacks or even complete failures. Being ready to bounce back and try again is a good capacity to develop during youth. It&#x27;s a crucial capacity to continue to develop into middle age. Now I&#x27;m curious about the book[1] from which this article was excerpted. This is the kind of thing I&#x27;d like to read for myself, as advice from one dad to another, and the kind of thing I&#x27;d like my children to read to prepare for their own independent adult lives.<p>[1] <i>Tell Me Something, She Said</i> by David Raether<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Tell-Me-Something-She-Said/dp/149363187X/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Tell-Me-Something-She-Said/dp/14936318...</a>",1384810251

Personally, I respect your gumption and initiative to carry this out.<p>I hope you get offers to work on the backend with you. If not, here are some ideas:<p>(1) Find a like-minded person at meetup groups. The Atlanta Ruby User Group, for example, has a contingent actively working on public good kind of apps, things more for non-profit work than for-profit work. While your local technical meetup group is a good place to start, there is nothing stopping you from emailing the ATLRUG mailing list and asking. There are other platform meetups you can try, like ones for Node.js, Erlang/Elixir, various Python groups, etc.<p>(2) Use the Tim Ferris method of calling up famous people. You never know. Being someone versed in JS, you could try Resig, or Katz, or the AngularJS core folks. You could also try one of the startup CEOs/CTOs you admire. I don&#x27;t think someone&#x27;s work should be judged on the novelty of being young, but it happens (people think, could I have pulled it off at your age?) Older folks who have amassed experience and power like teaching and mentoring young people, as it is not as threatening to one&#x27;s power base as young competition. You might not necessarily get such a person to work directly with you on the code, but you&#x27;re likely to get access to a network that you normally would not have access to.<p>(3) Scour the web for other similar competitions and contact the winners.

What do you like and not like about your previous bosses?<p>Here&#x27;s a few questions to consider:<p>How proactive are your reports? You might notice individuals on your team fall into two camps.  One group will keep you updated at all times.  That&#x27;s good.  The other won&#x27;t say anything unless asked.  They only do what they&#x27;re told and stay under the radar.  You&#x27;ll have to figure out what works best for you to have an idea what everyone is up to.<p>How do you listen to them? Not all my teammates speak English as their first language so initially I had a lot of trouble.  I learned over time to just shut up and let them work out their thoughts.<p>How do you grow your team?  I encourage them to explore side projects and I ask what they want out of their careers.  Not everyone is the same - some want to eventually run their own companies, others want to stay purely technical.  Some just want to tag along.  Doesn&#x27;t matter if they&#x27;re being 100% honest or not.  Just go the distance and help them grow, whatever resources they need.  I&#x27;ve always been pleasantly surprised when I genuinely invest in someone.<p>How do you win over your team? I have never, ever been able to successfully drive an agenda long-term by twisting someone&#x27;s arm.  It&#x27;s far easier for me to take the time and persuade rather than bark orders.<p>For reading - Effective Executive and How to Win Friends and Influence People are two books that come to mind.  One of my management mentors also recommended reading fiction as a way to understand motivations.  Here&#x27;s an article on this: <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/10/04/229190837/want-to-read-others-thoughts-try-reading-literary-fiction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/10/04/229190837/want-to...</a><p>I&#x27;ve only been managing for a few years.  Maybe everything&#x27;s still rosy.  I see management as achieving results, not controlling people.  Management is a way to multiply my effectiveness and accomplish more than a group of individuals.<p>Let me know if you want to discuss anything else.",1384809968

And sometimes all that&#x27;s needed is a small diversion, a bit of distraction, to allow the person to make it through the night without the attempted suicide, and to thus get help from doctors in the morning.<p>> Which leads back to my saying that you can&#x27;t really understand suicide, and why I think the GP post was valuable.<p>I don&#x27;t understand my own suicide attempts.  I certainly don&#x27;t understand the completed suicides of friends and acquaintances.  I&#x27;d be foolish if I pretended to understand the completed or attempted of people in other nations (with different cultural expectations and so on).   But GPs post (while it may have had a germ of useful information) is just weird and misleading.<p>Most people contemplating suicide are not in a position where euthanasia would be considered - they&#x27;re suffering from some mental health problem.  &quot;Wanting to kill yourself&quot; is not a rational reaction to life events.  At least, not for most of the people who complete suicide.  Some relatively minor interventions (a low interest loan of $4,000; some good debt advice; better lawyers and a decent legal system; housing advice; etc) would prevent many suicides.  To suggest that suicide is a rational choice when the person is not capable of making a rational choice about life is cruel.",1384809084

Most of what I&#x27;ve been interested in doing is in-browser. For my last project[1] I used a regular Clojure REPL to clarify my understanding of the standard lib and paste in little functions for testing.

I&#x27;ve made all kinds of moronic mistakes[2] that would ideally yield a warning or even a straight-up error, right at the source, but they don&#x27;t and I just end up finding data structures full of nils at runtime.

But I doubt I&#x27;ll still use it once I have more experience, as opposed to simply putting its component libraries (Compojure, Ring, lib-noir, etc.) into a project directly.

I have no idea why tech companies would pay engineers gobs of money,[1] spend gobs of money on huge office campuses,[2] then inflict open plan or cubicles on said engineers.<p>[1] Office space is expensive, but not that expensive relative to an engineer&#x27;s salary. The going rate for class A space in Manhattan is about $70/square foot per year. That puts a 10x10 office (assuming 85% usable space) at about $8,000 per year + build-out + maintenance.<p>[2] Apple&#x27;s new spaceship building (in the middle of a faceless suburb) will cost $5 billion and have 2.8 million square feet of space. One World Trade Center (in downtown Manhattan) will cost $3.9 billion and have over 3 million square feet of class A office space. A lower-profile project, the New York Times building in Midtown West, was constructed for $850 million and has 1.5 million square feet.<p>Apparently Google spent almost $2 billion on a squat 18-story structure in Manhattan with an over-abundance of depressing window-less interior spaces... I&#x27;m going to assume it was the difficulty of getting 2.9 million square feet in one place rather than just bad taste.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m not saying Apple&#x27;s offices are open plan. I have no idea what Apple&#x27;s setup is. I&#x27;m pointing out that companies are certainly willing to spend a lot of money on these big suburban office parks, multiples of what it would cost to just buy a couple of skyscrapers in SF. Thus, cost does not seem to be the motivating factor (except maybe in a penny-wise pound-foolish sort of way).",1384808564

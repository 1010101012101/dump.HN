Every other language that uses them as such puts them at the end of every expression, but it's fine if you want to put a semicolon at the beginning of every expression instead, except that that will confuse people coming from other languages.<p>What's not fine is pretending like javascript has significant whitespace and then...oops! it doesn't work here so we need to add something in this one special case.  That is guaranteed confusion.  If your only argument is that most of the time it's unnecessary, all you're really trying to accomplish is compression (guess what, JSMin does that!) and you may as well write APL.  ""You get used to it"" is meaningless.  You get used to banging your head against a wall too, if you do it long enough.  Doesn't mean it's a good idea.  It's actually worse than that though, because other people need to get used to it too, so you're wasting their time as well.<p>Surrounding all expressions (not statements) with parens <i>does</i> make sense, in many languages (because there are cases where you need them, and it pays to be explicit up front).  That is something good style guides often dictate (like surrounding all if/else blocks with braces, even if they're only one line).  Starting a comment after every line doesn't seem like a good analogy, I have no idea where you're going with that.<p>Let me be clear, and I've now wasted a bunch of time reading up on this so it's not just opinion: ASI is a crutch added to the language in order to minimize the effect of silly errors.  It is not a language feature.  Python was designed to have significant newlines, and they resolved the ambiguous cases.  Javascript was designed to have semicolons between statements when written correctly.  Abusing ASI is error-prone and not future-proof (against programmers, apparently language spec changes are going to maintain current behavior).  If you think its abuse is a good idea, you should be quarantined from the rest of the programming community.  Or write your own language and design it around this.",1334536747

3845238,comment,3844408,3845203,1,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, I think that's the correct analysis. Having lived in Houston a few years, one thing that I think happens is that <i>without</i> geographical constraints, and with the way things are currently funded, it's easier to just keep moving out. Where I lived in the 1990s was a ""new"" suburban area of Houston, but already by the 2000s there were abandoned stores, because if a store moved out of a building, <i>sometimes</i> another store moved in, but often it was easier to just build a new to-order building another mile south on the freeway, instead of renovating an existing one. With no constraints, you can just keep moving out another mile every year for decades. Same with suburbs; why renovate a 1970s house if you can just move another mile down the freeway and build a new one? Especially given the cheap construction that's been used for the last 50 years...<p>Part of that I think is also because some of the costs that incurs aren't properly charged. There was a proposal in Houston to charge developers for the cost of new infrastructure. For every 10,000 new homes built in a new suburb, for example, you can estimate what new capital infrastructure they'll need: on average 1 elementary school, 0.5 high schools, 1 fire station, 1 police station, X miles of roads, X miles of sewers, etc. (whatever the real numbers are). Add the estimated cost of that up, divide by 10,000, and charge that as a per-house assessment on new developments. That proposal failed, though, so new developments' indirect capital costs are subsidized by homeowners in the older areas of the city.",1334534931

Her mother had her placed in a mental institution when she was 16 (her admission).

When people started posting comments in the petition about how one of the band members is black, she deleted them, then finally deleted the petition, all the while continuing the harassment.<p>She doesn't have a cyber-stalker. The whole thing was made up because she didn't produce what she promised when she got kickstarter funding a few years ago, and now that she wants to scam them again, she thinks that this will work. The real name for what she is trying to do is extortion, with kickstarter as the victim.<p>Judging by how many people are so ""OMG this is terrible shame on kickstarter"" without doing any sort of reality check - not even seeing the obvious contradictions in the story she put out on her ""I'm being cyber-stalked"" page, it makes me wonder.<p>Re:Interesting: marketing.

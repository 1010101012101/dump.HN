The way our process works is that these domains are purchased by a very non-technical person and they are automatically provisioned. That's the most important part of this entire process.",1198101561

What does that mean? $1 per 1-watt maximum power production?  $1 per 1-watt/hour maximum or estimated output? <p>A power plant has a MW rating, like this:<p><a href=""http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/at_a_glance/reactors/beavervalley.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/at_a_glance/reacto...</a><p>About 810 MW/reactor. If they are rating a cell at 1-watt maximum output, it is probably dishonest unless they are accounting for clouds and nighttime, etc. What is the cost of infrastructure to maintain energy at night? Are millions of flywheels or batteries cheaper than a power plant?<p>It's weird how the NYT will spend 9 pages on baloney, but only give something like this a tiny article.",1198098610

It includes the complete source to its powerful GUI system, and is the only GUI toolkit I know of that is clean, readable, and hackable.""",1198098501

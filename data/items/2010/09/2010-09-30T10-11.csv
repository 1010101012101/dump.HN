In my opinion, stalling the transition hurts innovation; while it's true that as the things are at present public addresses are not an imperative, new technologies like P2P, which would greatly benefit from public addresses, open a whole new realm of possibilities.<p>2. Again correct, assuming that there is no cheaper alternative to the ""addresses market"". But it exists, and is (mostly) free. Once the providers realize that it's less expensive (longterm) to switch to IPv6 than to keep buying new addresses, they'll do it, even such a solution might prolong things even more.<p>In general, most of ""solutions"" to the IPv4 crisis represent a sizable effort, which will only increase as the addresses become more scarce; and the sum of it will be much larger than the effort of simply switching to v6. We'll see how it will turn out though.",1285844124

1742848,comment,1742305,1742305,0,0,CrLf,,,"The real problem with IPv6 is that it focuses too much on the technical issues and mostly ignores the human issues. This is why it hasn't gained significant traction and, IMHO, won't even when the IANA runs out of unallocated IPv4 blocks.<p>There are a few main issues with IPv4:<p>1. Everybody wants to have a public IP address, and that is making the available IP addresses run out really fast;
2. There are huge chunks of allocated addresses that are in fact unused. And there are also a number of public addressable /8's being used for internal networks for no good reason;
3. Splitting up wasted /8's in (geographically disperse) small chunks isn't feasible because routing tables would get huge.<p>No. 1 is easy to solve: not everybody needs a public IP address, no matter what people say. Mobile phones can survive just fine with private addressing behind a NAT. Public addresses for mobile users could be handed out on a case-by-case basis, for an additional fee.<p>No. 2 will come into play once we run out of address space. Scarcity will trigger a market for IPv4 addresses, and as any scarce resource, its use will be rationalized and made more efficient.<p>No. 3 is the most tricky. But that's where IPv6 really appears as the problem solver. Internet backbones will have a different structure than the IPv4 addressing implies, and that structure will be made with IPv6. IPv4 will be tunneled over IPv6 networks with its own structure. In fact, this has been done for a long while inside the ISP's networks using MPLS (IP packets enter the ISP network and are then routed using MPLS until they exit into another ISP/carrier's network). Those multiple MPLS domains will become a single IPv6 domain.<p>The structure of the Internet will change when IPv4 addresses become scarce, that's for sure, but I seriously doubt IPv6 will gain acceptance at the network endpoints. There is just too much legacy for that to happen in the next 30 years at least.<p>I belive in scarcity dynamics, so I'm not too worried. Also I also belive NAT to be a good solution for private networks and don't agree with the view that NAT is evil.",1285843189

The only difference is that it's no longer in the default global namespace (map and filter still are, of course).<p>This matches up pretty cleanly with my actual experience of writing Python; I've written a hell of a lot of Python code these past 6-7 years and so far as I can recall I've never used reduce.<p>(and if you want to get picky about this, keep in mind how much of <i>Haskell</i> requires import statements to get at -- moving less-commonly-used stuff into standard modules is not a bad thing at all)",1285841466

Sure it's kind of cool to earn little badges and unlock achievements, but it seems too gimmicky for me.  Right now people are trying to ""game-ify"" everything like it's a magical pill that makes everything boring super exciting and addictive that people can't stop.  They say the whole point of adding these features is to drive user engagement up on the site...or to focus users on the tasks that website owners want.  If that was the case as a website owner I'd give out badges and virtual prizes for clicking on ads.  ""You just unlocked the ad clicker badge!""<p>Aside from that it seems silly after a while when the make the barrier so low to gaining badges and achievements.  Once you start rewarding every little thing it starts becoming less meaningful.  It's kind of like getting those Certificate of Participation awards at a science fair.  Sure you got an award, but you just had to show up.<p>Next thing you know badgeville will try to expand into human behavior...creating achievements, points, and badges for every day human things.

1742790,comment,1739243,1740434,0,0,jcroberts,,,"We can rest assured that facebook simply doesn't care about this non-issue of image access, so increasing the bit width is not worth their time, but assuming someone actually had this need, doing it right is a lot more complicated than it seems at first glance. --Again, this is admittedly another annoying ""noodley point"" but it could be important for someone.<p>ASSUMING: The systems are most likely run in virtual machines, and the UID's are most likely the keys for a key-value store. Whether or not the UID are specific to just images, or are also used for other things (wall posts or whatever) is unknown.<p>The first question is whether or not your key-value store can handle the increase in key length (UID). Since this is fixable, the safe assumption is ""yes"" albeit there might be undesirable (or even unsurmountable) performance penalties.<p>A good PRNG is fed by a system entropy pool, and the pool is populated by various system entropy sources. Some believe virtualization can make the system entropy pool more predictable, but some believe virtualization can make the system entropy pool less predictable. It doesn't really matter which is true. The important point is if you can exhaust the system entropy pool, one of two things will happen; (1) the system will get bogged down waiting on the pool, or (2) a poorly written PRNG will start giving you less random numbers.<p>Of course, ""less random"" is the most accurate way to phrase it, but in some cases, the actual result is the (faulty) PRNG gives you ""predicable"" numbers if the system entropy pool is exhausted.<p>To do it right, you'd have to evaluate the frequency/pressure on the system entropy pool before increasing the key/UID width or you might suffer some highly undesirable effects. There are essentially two places where you might need to add hardware; (1) performance penalties of increased key width in the key-value store, and (2) performance penalties from exhaustion of the system entropy pool (with a well written PRNG). With the former you'd be paying for more servers, and with the latter you'd be paying for more entropy sources to feed the pools. I'm not sure how one would add specialized entropy source hardware in a virtualized environment, but with enough cost and effort, it might be doable (device mapping?). Needless to say, in either case or both, the costs could be prohibitive.<p>The admittedly ""noodley"" point here is correctly maintaining a constant threshold level of entropy is occasionally easier said than done. Of course, in other cases, it might be brain dead simple to maintain a constant threshold. The only way to figure it out is proper testing.<p>The non-power-of-two 136 bit length you mentioned seems interesting. I might be (incorrectly) reading more into it that is actually there, but I believe it hints at a far more cost effective solution, namely, just add more k-v stores. For example, the key/UID could only be 128 bits wide, and the extra eight bits indicate a particular k-v store.  With the k-v stores being located ""close"" to the user, this could also improve bandwidth costs, usability/latency, and load balancing, in addition to the benefits of the CDN.<p>I don't have a facebook account, so I can't check, but if there's some degree of predictability in a single byte (leading, trailing, middle, ?) of the UID, it would be further support of the above theory of operation. It doesn't need to be perfectly consistent, since at each location there are probably multiple k-v stores.<p>Even on a collision of a generated key/uid in a particular k-v store, the UID might not be thrown out unless it was already used in _all_ of the local k-v stores.  This would further reduce the pressure on the system entropy pool, but due to the need for replication/redundancy/backup, I seriously doubt this is the case.<p>Though going from 128 bit to 136 bit (or similar) _is_ an increase of the width of the identifier, it probably has nothing to do with maintaining a constant threshold of entropy. It's probably just a smart business decision to reduce hardware/bandwidth costs.<p>PLEASE NOTE: The above is only mindless speculation about how the 136 bit UIDs/keys might work, and (hopefully) no one at facebook will confirm or deny it.",1285841188

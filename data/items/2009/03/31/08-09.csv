539830,comment,539457,539683,0,0,jmatt,,,"Congratulations on getting in.<p>I graduated about 15 years ago. I'll give you a quick summary of the top people in my class. I went to an ""average"" midwest public high school with about 2000 students freshman year and 450 students graduating senior year.<p>If it is at all reassuring the one person I knew in high school who went to Harvard is now unemployed. He's also a schmuck and I wouldn't be surprised if he ended up in politics in the near future... no surprise.<p>Out of the other top ten in high school that I still keep in contact with three went to state schools on full rides and one went to a second tier ivy league school. They are a chiropractor, a vet and and two doctors. This is also no surprise if you saw them in AP Biology. I think I was the only one in the top 25 to go into Engineering (actually Computer Science). Everyone thought the best way to succeed was to be a doctor, which was largely due to growing up in my home town. The doctors appeared to be doing far better than most engineers or executives at engineering companies.<p>The most financially successful (as far as I know) is the girl who ended up at google working in the Marketing department pre IPO (I'll take luck over skill any day).<p>As for the admissions process, it's just the beginning of the journey. So don't get to wrapped up in it. From my experience: In a six months no one will ask you where else you were accepted... In six years no one will ask what your college GPA was... and in twelve years no one will ask where you went to college. Or at least they won't care much.. only in idle conversation. So use it as an opportunity and enjoy it while you can.",1238489701

539826,comment,539814,539819,0,0,jpcx01,,,"Very useful answer. Thanks!<p>One quick clarification.. what if I reused CSS and Image Assets from PhpBB? Its sort of strange there because there are many templates that are under different licenses than the source code itself.<p>How does one define GPL on CSS and Images? They are open by default (since anyone can view source on a browser). I'm guessing this IP is governed under a different set of laws (copyright?).",1238489283
539825,comment,538377,538975,0,0,patio11,,,"OK, if you want to pick the dangerous part of this, folks, it is NOT the construction.  It is the fact of there being a pool, itself.  Standing water kills children.  It is one of the most prolific killers of children in the United States -- not as bad as that noted scourge, plastic buckets, but almost there.<p>Seriously -- we have REALLY warped senses of what is dangerous.  What is the scenario for the pool ""collapsing"" when his children are playing in it?  A 60 pound girl waves her arm displacing perhaps 2 pounds of water at a few inches per second, which then pounds the surrounding concrete to dust, causing it to fly at supersonic speeds into the water, in the direction opposite the water pressure?  I didn't exactly do so great in physics but I'm finding that sort of unlikely.<p>The most likely failure -- his pool springs a serious leak.  The garage gets written off.  Oh well.",1238489196

539819,comment,539814,539814,0,0,bdfh42,,,"This one is pretty simple. If you were to write a clone of (say) PhpBB without looking at the original source code but just re-engineering the functionality you wanted to replicate then you would have a new piece of software over which you could claim copyright and which you could license as you wish. This is just the same as sitting down to write (for example) a new word processing program that emulated key features of MS Word.<p>However, porting an existing GPL code base to a new language would I strongly suspect be seen as a simple ""fork"" of the original code and you would (quite rightly) have to release your new code under the GPL license. This is fair and just - you can't just rip off other peoples intellectual property no matter how much work there is involved in doing so.",1238488863

In fact Prozac was synthesised from benadryl, in attempt to make it more potent antidepressant. Chlorpheniramine was researched by swedish scientist, who won Nobel prize (not sure for what exactly), in 1950-s and was found to have SNRI effects.

I realize you can in principle debug everything, know the state of the machine completely, etc.  What I am trying to point out is that it is too much information to handle at that level of detail.  It doesn't matter if it's written in Lisp or Swahili.  And the fact remains that even if you convinced 90% of the next generation of programmers to use Lisp, you still have 50 years of legacy code lying around in other langauges.  These are practical facts that can't be washed away with a new (or old) programming paradigm.",1238487505

The last I heard was that at least they are profitable now. However, there's 6 years or so of vastly unprofitable to pay back before they actually make any money from the venture. By that time we'll be into the next console war, and who wins that is anyones guess. (Whoever stops using discs for the love of god).<p>People hate MS for a variety of reasons. My top 3:<p><pre><code>  1. Taste - they consistently implement bad solutions rather than good, elegant solutions.\n  2. The internet - they show consistently that they do not understand the internet.\n     They loose enough money on it. They don't get advertising, building webapps, browsers, etc\n  3. Bullying - Squashing the competition and giving users a worse experience isn't nice.\n     It holds back progress. Suing people because they use the FAT format is ridiculous and indefensible.\n     The FAT format is so simple it's trivial.\n</code></pre>\nThey are irrelevant to most people in any event.

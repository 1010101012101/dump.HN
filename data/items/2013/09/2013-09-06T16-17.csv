6341393,comment,6341264,6341264,5,0,lutusp,,,"> I&#x27;ve decided that the stock market, as a long-term investment strategy, isn&#x27;t something appealing to me ...<p>Why? It&#x27;s one of the few sound long-term investments.<p>> While I&#x27;m not adverse to risk, I feel that trading in a marketplace controlled by professional investors with access to research and high-frequency trading tools is a losing proposition.<p>If that were true, businesses would refuse to raise capital using equities -- businessmen aren&#x27;t fools, but they regard the equities market as a legitimate source of operating capital. There&#x27;s a reason for that trust.<p>> How else do you apply your savings if you&#x27;re unwilling to invest in the stock market?<p>My advice to you is to abandon your present thinking process, reconsider the value of equities, but don&#x27;t hire a broker or invest in individual stocks, instead establish a long-term buy and hold position in an index fund -- a fund that tracks a market indicator like the DJIA. No stockbroker, no one selling you useless investment advice, no portfolio churning, just long-term growth.<p>More here: <a href=""http://arachnoid.com/equities_myths"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/equities_myths</a>",1378486785

6341382,comment,6340436,6340436,7,0,jccooper,,,"Good for them, but man it&#x27;s been a long time. SS1 won the X-Prize almost exactly 9 years ago, and apparently took about 3 years to get there. I know a revenue version is going to have more details to attend to, but that&#x27;s still a long time for approximately the same system.<p>My understanding from the &quot;industry&quot; is that most of the delay was in scaling the hybrid engine up. Which I can imagine, as it&#x27;s the largest operational hybrid ever made--though a smallish motor as far as conventional liquid or solid rocketry goes.<p>I wonder if they regret pioneering in this particular area. If it works eventually (and looks like they finally got it going) it may work out okay, but they&#x27;d probably have been flying years ago with a liquid system. As is they may just barely beat XCOR (which has next to no money in comparison) into revenue flight.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t doubt that the hybrid approach was a poor idea (if for no other reason than casting and reloading giant rubber grains seems cumbersome in comparison to re-filling with kerosene), but we&#x27;ll soon have a hybrid rocketplane (SS2) and a liquid rocketplane (Lynx) flying side-by-side, so I guess we&#x27;ll see.

If a megacorp is making money it can surely stand to not make so much.<p>The very reasons to maintain some form of roaming charges comes down to, who built the towers? Who invested in the hardware, software, and persons, working to provide the service? I do not care one wit about this claim &quot;public resources&quot; when it comes to cell phones? Why not? Because it is a patent excuse to take. The same excuse is used when people want specific speech censored from the airwaves but not another. However, hell and high water reign should the same taking be done to something techies hold near and dear to their hearts, you would never see them support taking of speech rights or such with regards to their blogs, sites, and whatnot.<p>Back to roaming charges. Should we not then force nation states to not charge access fees to their networks? Many do. They charge carriers for calls going into their state owned agencies.<p>Simply put, don&#x27;t allow roaming charges and costs will be spread to anyone using a cell phone, whether they roam or not.

And that, it turns out, might be one secret to their success.&quot;<p>And there it is, folks!<p>It&#x27;s an interesting contrast to yesterday&#x27;s postings wherein I&#x27;ve seen comments from a former member of a board of education, and a teacher involved in a teacher&#x27;s union. That there seems to be this expectation in America to leave education up to the professionals (state-certified teachers).<p>There&#x27;s a stigma attached to home-schooling, as it is highly associated with religious fundamentalists indoctrinating kids, and further, parents might &quot;mess up&quot; their children&#x27;s education.<p>This phenomena is thoroughly explored in John Taylor Gatto&#x27;s book, &quot;Underground History of American Education.&quot; In the 1800s, children were taught to read at home. The push towards compulsory education, however, somehow convinced the American public that parents are no longer good enough to teach their kids.<p>That is crazy.<p>Coming from an Asian family, this notion would have been absurd. It isn&#x27;t about who is &quot;qualified&quot; to teach something, and more about gaining competitive advantages. (Now, Asian family dynamics have their own shadow-sides too).",1378486607

I understand the concepts behind functional programming, and trying to implement them in JavaScript (recently read <i>Functional JavaScript</i> too).<p>But from my experience, functional programming is mainly useful for parallelization/distribution of computation, because it&#x27;s essentially mathematical -- functional code tends to be harder to write, understand, and debug, but you do it when you need to be able to split up computation.

The idea that you have a cloud of people just out there taking in your content or marketing or apps or whatever just means they are sitting at the top of the funnel.<p>You don&#x27;t have to treat them like a meat grinder at all. You don&#x27;t have to push every person &quot;into the funnel&quot;. In fact, I would argue that&#x27;s doing it wrong.<p>If anything, the funnel should be a set of gates people pass through, more like a filter that at each stage people are more likely the target audience for what you are selling.<p>For example, when you go into an Apple store, they let you hang out, play with things, and are generally pretty nice to you. They also ask you questions about your needs and wants in product and they steer you towards what they think might be the best fit. Thus, filtering you down to the right product. BUT, if you can&#x27;t afford the actual purchase, they aren&#x27;t going to force you into buying or badger you into something.<p>If more websites treated their funnels like a filter instead of like chute you are trying to force people down, the better off marketing would be as a whole. It actually makes the whole process better because you don&#x27;t even try to pitch until they are ready to buy.<p>For example, on a current side project I don&#x27;t even show pricing until people use the product. I don&#x27;t even give them the opportunity to buy until they have shown that they will use it. I don&#x27;t want angry customers saying they bought something that they didn&#x27;t use and want a refund. So, we don&#x27;t try to sell until people are happy enough using the product.<p>We will probably get fewer customers and revenue this way, but our customers will be happier and we will only have customers that use our product instead of people who are paying us because we are good at marketing to them.",1378485667

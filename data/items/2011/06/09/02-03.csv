Wolfram says: why consider computer programs to be valuable as mere <i>approximations</i> to the underlying analytic models, when you can consider computer programs <i>themselves</i> to be an entirely new and unexplored land of complex and interesting models.<p>Traditional computer science considers computer programs to be merely a means to an end.<p>A quite delicious irony is given by the example of Naiver Stokes equations. They are themselves an idealization of the flow of fluids composed of discrete particles. Because of our obsession with continuous models, we mostly resort to laboriously solving them numerically -- but it turns out that simple lattice gas cellular automaton models are actually 1) fairly accurate 2) much more computationally efficient, and 3) more suggestive of the underlying microscale physics.<p>To step back a bit, a helpful analogy would be that simple computations are the 21st century equivalent of differential equations, which were studied rigorously in their own right starting in the 18th century, often prior to their application to concrete problems.<p>Whether this intuition will turn out to be prescient, or whether it will fizzle out, is another question.",1307588279

You (obviously) need to find a job, any job, whether it is temping, stacking books in the local library, retail, anything. Diminish your credentials if need be. You sound like an intelligent guy, you can probably think of ways to make yourself at least temporarily appealing to jobs that are objectively below you.<p>I am very sympathetic with your parent situation. You are lucky at least that they are old enough to be drawing SS and Medicare. It sounds like you are in a low-cost area and so that should be enough to at least support them at a minimum American subsistence level. With consistent checks coming in and government-supported health care, it would be hard for them to royally screw themselves permanently in the financial sense. And unless they are wealthy, it does not sound like they really need estate planning, and you can try to help with day to day care but you cannot let it consume you.<p>I echo everything everyone has said about community and inspiration. Sites like News.YC provide all the inspiration I need - I have actually found the hackers and founders type meetups I have been to to be quite underwhelming compared to what I read and the people I interact with online.<p>I hope for the best for you.",1307588238

I just don't think that Wolfram deserves credit for it.<p>Edit for clarification:\nThe key insight being that you can model things algorithmically.  Whether it's ""correct"" or not is a different matter.  But this type of modeling is different from analytical modeling.",1307586366

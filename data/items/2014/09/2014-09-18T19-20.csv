Since then I&#x27;ve been on a little odyssey exploring the open source contenders.<p>I ran owncloud briefly. File syncing performance was terrible. You really don&#x27;t want to write your file synchronization service as an afterthought inside a PHP application.<p>I ran seafile for a while, but I don&#x27;t like their security story. The authors have said some things that show they are a little out of their depth when it comes to crypto. Also, last I checked they had no good story for running multiple server in parallel, and the data on the server is not accessible as regular files. Also, written in C, and there are very few people I trust to write C without nuking my security.<p>I ran git-annex. Joey Hess is doing a good job with that project, but I think the symlink-oriented architecture is just not good enough. &quot;Direct mode&quot; is supposed to avoid symlinks, but direct mode seems much less stable, and it still exposes symlinks when you have data that&#x27;s only partially synced. Too many apps do bad things when you give them symlinks. Also, I like Haskell the language, but Haskell the toolchain sucks hard, and I gave up trying to build git-annex from source to play with it.<p>Now I&#x27;m running syncthing and I have to say I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised. I had passed on them earlier due to reports of performance problems, but since the 0.9 release performance is much improved. The global discovery is particularly nice. I have two servers and two laptops all synchronizing with each other. One server is publicly reachable, the other is inside a LAN only accessible when I&#x27;m inside. It does the right thing whether I&#x27;m home inside the LAN, where I get fast sync with the local server. It does the right thing when I&#x27;m away, synchronizing with the publicly addressable server, which then transitively synchronizes with the LAN server.<p>It&#x27;s written in Go, so I&#x27;m less worried about buffer overrun shenanigans. It uses the stock Go SSL stack, so no worrying about weird hand-rolled transport and authentication protocols. And authentication is clear and simple: every client has a cert, the client&#x27;s name is the cert&#x27;s fingerprint. No certificate authorities.<p>Syncthing has some versioning support, but I decided to use bup instead for belt-and-suspenders. So all my synced files are also snapshotted by bup every ten minutes on both servers.",1411069739

8337210,comment,8335570,8336827,5,0,ganeumann,,,"I think grella said the advantages of convertible notes are:<p>1. First note is capped but later notes can be uncapped;\n2. Fewer tax risks;\n3. Doesn&#x27;t mess up your equity pricing;\n4. You can do a number of notes with different amounts raised;\n5. You don&#x27;t give your investors the kind of protections they would get in equity rounds.<p>I&#x27;d like to hear Mark&#x27;s reply too. My opinion below.<p>I tend to think that all of these things (aside from the tax risks) are either inconsequential in comparison to equity financing (3, 4), or simply the result of having unsophisticated or uncaring investors (1, 5). The tax risks he did not explain; I assume he means the risk that the IRS would use an equity round to peg a value on shares or options given to employees that differs from what the company assumed. If so, this risk exists no matter what.<p>I agree that giving the investors less protective provisions or uncapped notes is better for the company. If you can get investors to agree to that, good for you, but that&#x27;s separate from structure.<p>The primary problem with convertible notes as they are used today for entrepreneurs is that the investor gets the lower of the cap or a discount to the next round. This optionality is paid for by the entrepreneur. And while, as grella points out, the cost of this optionality is usually pretty low, so is the value of the benefits he points out.",1411069644

I don&#x27;t think that there is a correlation between convertible note seed financings and rising valuations: valuations are rising for all types of financings over the last five years.<p>The downside to a note is exactly this: the cap in the note is the valuation an investor would pay. That is how I view it, as an investor. And when the next round is lower than the cap, it usually means the company is busted somehow. I am completely indifferent, as an investor, to a convertible note or equity because the outcome is generally the same for me. The reason I hate notes generally has to do with the negotiations around them (what&#x27;s the term, what happens if the company gets acquired before the A, what happens if the other angels get pissy and try to claim that the company is in default, do I have pro-rata rights in the next round, etc.)<p>But my biggest fear with convertible notes is what the Series A VCs are going to do to me, the angel investor. They could generally not give a damn about me and since the company already has my money, I have no negotiating leverage if they decide to do anything aggressive. With an equity deal, I know what I have and, since it&#x27;s very similar to what the founders have (common stock) it&#x27;s hard to screw me without screwing the founders.<p>I&#x27;d like to know what you consider the upside of convertible notes, or how they give the entrepreneur leverage, because I just don&#x27;t see them.",1411068814

This applies especially to characters, who frequently are no more than walking, talking representatives of those concepts. They often are not realistic, convincing, engaging people and they aren&#x27;t having realistic interactions. Also, they too often have immature points of view.<p>If you want concepts, then sci-fi is appealing. If you want a full, convincing story, then those weak characters (and other problems) can be un-engaging, distracting (frustrating, silly, etc.), or even completely undermine the story. It&#x27;s like eating good food (i.e., the concepts) mixed with something bland or even bad-tasting.<p>Certainly there are good sci-fi writers; I&#x27;m not dismissing the whole genre.

In psychiatry, authority matters. In science, it doesn&#x27;t. How else could Insel unilaterally describe psychiatry as a pseudoscience and rule that the DSM is to be abandoned, as he recently did? That would never be accepted in a scientific field, where authority is disparaged.<p>How else could a panel of authorities vote to include some imaginary conditions, and exclude other imaginary conditions, from the latest DSM? They did just that, and one change from the past was that the votes were held in secret. Another difference was that the governmental agencies that rely on the DSM have decided to abandon it.<p>>>The bottom line is that a scientist would never say, &quot;We don&#x27;t know what this is, but let&#x27;s offer clinical treatments anyway -- because the public doesn&#x27;t understand either science or our poverty of knowledge.&quot;<p>> This is also not true. Doctors offer treatments that aren&#x27;t definitively explained all the time.<p>This kind of reply makes me wonder what is the point of this exchange.

As gitflow is just a process for managing your branching and merging features into your mainline branches, no project out there will show &#x27;success&#x27; based solely upon using gitflow.<p>Here is why we use gitflow:<p>We have 5 developers working on a project at a time.<p>We release versions of this application to our testing environments twice a day, and to production every 1-3 days.<p>Before we started using gitflow, we had deployments to our production environment hald back due to commits that weren&#x27;t tested yet, and thus having no surety that we were good to go to production.  Now that we use gitflow, my developers keep their work in feature branches, can commit at will, and only merge it back to our develop branch when the feature is complete.  Furthermore, we use &#x27;releases&#x27; in git flow as well, so I can take a snapshot of develop, make changes only to fix what is in a release, and merge the release back when it is signed off on by the business.  It has allowed us to continue to move VERY quickly, and still control precisely what is in each build.<p>The killer feature, for me at least, is the &#x27;hotfix&#x27; feature though. With deploying as often as we do, there are bound to be issues that need to be fixed right now.  using &#x27;git flow hotfix&#x27; I get a branch that is based off of master (production), can make the changes we need, and when I merge it back, it is automatically merged to both master and develop, tagged as a release, and I can deploy a build from master immediately.",1411067849

They have often released albums on a smaller indie label first, usually recorded on studio time for which they themselves paid. There are many artists that have made a living doing things like this for years and even decades, and they are harmed by a music culture which values artists purely based on the number of units of recordings they can move. It is not a simple binary choice between making things bad for the artists or good for the artists by pirating music or not. I personally think that piracy is the catalyst that will effect a tremendous and positive shift in the music industry, where the artistic qualities of the music and, importantly, the performance of music, take primacy over moving enough album units to hit the quarterly sales goal. Maybe the resulting industry will have a lower overall profitability, but maybe that&#x27;s not entirely a bad thing, since most of the profits the recording industry has made were based on unethical business practices. The idea that this will spell the end of music because musicians won&#x27;t be able to make a living is absurd and betrays your lack of vision and historical perspective",1411067216

US Postal system is a great example, everyone finds plenty to criticize, and yet standard mail delivery is more reliable than email (and getting more expensive by the second as neo-liberal ideology dictates USPS should be &quot;profitable&quot;. I&#x27;ve heard the same nonsense is at play with Deutsches Bahn, leading to the demise of the S-Bahn in Berlin).<p>But also there&#x27;s the cultural side, which is the emphasis in advertising from the 1950s onward to portray an individual self-disambiguating from monolithic society tastes and norms, by buying a Beetle, or smoking a Marlboro, or chewing a different gum. This plus tie-ins to James Dean-style Hollywood efforts, and it&#x27;s a very unified message that is nonetheless somewhat invisible.<p>The article is correct to note the attitude that &quot;it&#x27;s not propaganda if you agree with it&quot;, it&#x27;s been a huge win for advertising to promote and co-opt this attitude with subtle directions toward consumerism, and its close affinity with deeply conservative anti-socialist tactics is worth further investigation.",1411067191

There&#x27;s a place to add a template string in a directive but there&#x27;s no place to add a &quot;styling string&quot;. Typically you just put in classes and ids in your template string that references the global css file/s. If you try to reuse the directive in another project you have to move your css file over as well. The only way around this, or in essence to make a truly self contained and re-useable component is to inline the styles in the styles attribute. It gets a bit ugly in that case.",1411067174

In response to this, the AA was formed to warn motorists of speed traps down the road.<p>This started to cut into profits, so the the government retaliated by charging and convicting an AA guy with &quot;obstruction of justice&quot;.  AA agents were therefore not allowed to inform motorists of speed traps.<p>The AA responded by changing their protocol.  They would always salute passing motorists <i>unless</i> there was something wrong (aka, unless there was a speed trap).  The <i>absence</i> of a salute indicated a speed trap, and the law could not force the AA to salute.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this was ever challenged in court, but they were able to keep it up for several decades so it was never <i>successfully</i> challenged in court at least.<p>Edit: The AA could be considered sort of similar to the american AAA (<i>&quot;triple-A&quot;</i>).  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Automobile_Association"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Automobile_Association</a> <a href=""http://www.theaa.com/aboutaa/history.html#tabview=tab1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theaa.com/aboutaa/history.html#tabview=tab1</a>",1411067133

To do this, Holschuh says there are only two options: either maintaining a constant, toasty temperature, or incorporating a locking mechanism to keep the coils from loosening. The first option would overheat an astronaut and require heavy battery packs â€” a design that would significantly impede mobility, and is likely infeasible given the limited power resources available to astronauts in space. Holschuh and Newman are currently exploring the second option, looking into potential mechanisms to lock or clip the coils in place.",1411067128

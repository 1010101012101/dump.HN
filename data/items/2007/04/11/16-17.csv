11935,comment,11935,9770,0,0,chuck,,,"Seems way to early to declare them dead.  Have you never watched a basketball game where momentum shifts and the dominant team is on the ropes, but it's only halftime. There's plenty of time to come storming back. In other words, the game isn't over.  It's way too early to call them dead.<p>Based on your assumptions, if they are indeed dead or headed inexorably in that direction, then why aren't we all using thin clients connected to superfast pipes running ajaxified code?  Perhaps, it doesn't always work that well?<p>I guess all these web2.0 companies, y-combinator included, didn't use powerpoint for their deck?  Or the execs don't run windows mobile 5.0 on their smartphone?<p>You make a lot of valid points but you omit a lot in the analysis and you get kinda religous about it all.<p>When a team declares victory just by taking the lead... you know that team is scared.

Thats where Tech is, its where Technology Square is, its where all the growth is.  The Perimeter area is just full of old established insurance companies, marketing and spamming companies -- the ""old school"" suits.  Midtown is where all the young professionals and visionaries are, plus its literally the only place centralized to all of the metro atlanta area instead of just the northern edge like Perimeter would be.<p>Just my two cents ;)",1176309630

11927,comment,11915,11915,0,0,timg,,,"I started off hosting remotely, but my extremely cheep hosting plan limited my CPU time excessively. Since I was behind a NAT, I had to do some proxying tricks through my provider to serve from my home computer: <p><a href=""http://programming.reddit.com/info/1e1a7/comments/c1e4ka"">http://programming.reddit.com/info/1e1a7/comments/c1e4ka</a><p>That certainly worked well. Now that I have more money to burn and a big site nearing launch though, I will definitely be trying out some dedicated hosting.<p>Basically the answer is: depends how broke you are.",1176309218

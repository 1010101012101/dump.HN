1654872,comment,1654778,1654778,0,0,gilbertl,,,"This is such a weak post especially coming from ""An Ivy League MBA."" I thought business schools teach people to write essays with strong arguments.<p>The first few paragraphs talks about how Facebook has not and probably cannot charge its users. Google doesn't charge its users either; is Google ""worthless?""<p>The next few paragraphs states that Facebook is not interesting anymore, claiming news feed is full of nothing but ""bored office workers"", ""super moms"", et al. First off, the author's experience is anecdotal. Second, all the ""bored office workers"" and ""super mom"" quotes - as stupid as they may sound - are parts of socializing. When we ""chill out"" with our friends, what do we talk about other than ""man, my work sucks"" or ""omg, my son Jonny is learning to walk!""?<p>It is not that ""bored office workers"" and ""super moms"" are uninteresting; it's just that the author is either 1) independent and/or self-center or 2) has too many people on FB she doesn't care about. If it's the latter, the author should learn to ""hide"" uninteresting people in her stream.<p>Finally, the author ends the post by saying that FB's cost is rising and that it should charge $0.99/mth to ""be worth something."" Yet, never does the author mention 1) how much cost is rising and 2) how much FB's revenue is growing.<p>The details are unclear, but Facebook became cash-flow positive in 2009, and there's no signs of it slowing down.<p>So Facebook is worth something unless this whole ""online social"" thing-a-magic is really a fad. But to find out, shouldn't we ask all the ""bored office workers"" and the ""super moms"" - the people who socialize the most - rather than a business MBA who could care less about small talk?",1283389042

So the big issues are in price discrimination research and research on network effects.<p>Not that it isn't an important new idea in practice, since the psychological difference between 0.01 cents and 0.00 cents is huge.<p>If you end up doing the thesis with on freemium, you'll probably either end up doing a quantitative analysis (check out the quant research on shareware), or qualitative analysis around price discrimination, network effects and business models (check out this MA thesis <a href=""https://jyx.jyu.fi/dspace/handle/123456789/23051"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jyx.jyu.fi/dspace/handle/123456789/23051</a>).",1283388085

1654831,comment,1653891,1654336,0,0,blhack,,,"I hope your friend also understands how much this will get people like me to come back.<p>There is a bar in Phoenix that I used to go to all the time (when the weather calms down, I'll start going again [because I bike there]).  One of the <i>major</i> reasons that I went back so often, is because I felt like a regular there.  It was a very common occurrence for the bartenders to offer me a free drink.  A lot of these free drinks were beer that had been poured wrong, or stuff that they would have had to pour down the drain, but not all of them.<p>This is something I think a lot of people don't understand (not saying your friend, just in general); when you own a business, you're not selling widgets, you're selling customer service.  I wasn't going to the bar to buy beer, I was going because one of the bartenders looked at me one night (I was feeling down about something) and said ""Dude, what's wrong?"" and tried to cheer me up...or another night when another bartender didn't charge me the $10 that they usually charge for growlers (a glass chug that holds 1 gallon of beer and is for transporting it home [common at breweries that don't bottle their beer])...<p>All in all, that place has probably given me 10 beers for free; at most $20 worth of product.  But that $20 has probably come back to them 10-100 fold in the last couple of years.  I'd say about half of my family's birthdays now take place at that bar, (I've taken my sisters and my mom there, they all love it, it really really is truly unlike any other restaurant I've been to in Phoenix), as well as most of my friends.  I've recommended it to literally hundreds of people.<p>Contrast this with a bar in Tempe where I took a visiting friend for drinks: the bartender didn't want to talk to us and, when we asked him why he was using a jigger to measure the mixed drink that my friend ordered (it was taking a long time and we said something to the effect of ""We really don't care about the measurements being that exact"") he explained how close of an eye the managers keep on the alcohol shrinkage.<p>Another story for me is dell: when I call dell, I talk to Lisa, who remembers my name, remembers where I live (Phoenix) and remembers the time that her and her husband came here to visit...and how nice the weather was.  ""Is that place on scottsdale road that sells the ice cream still there?""<p>Artificial as I'm sure all of this is (Lisa probably has a computer that remembers this stuff for her), I like it.  I like going into a coffee shop and feeling like the owner of the shop is a friend of mine and I'm just coming over to his house to hang out (there was a coffee shop in Des Moines, IA; 3 years after I moved away, I came back to have to have the  owner greet me with ""RYAN!?! Where the hell have you been!? Has the band been on tour or something? [the first time I went into his shop I had a DW drums tshirt on.  The joke from then on was that I was a famous drummer]).<p>I think it's important for business owners to remember this type of thing: you're absolutely not selling coffee, or beer, or dell computers, you're selling me a little temporary friend that makes me feel like they really and truly care about whatever problem I am coming to them to solve.",1283387891

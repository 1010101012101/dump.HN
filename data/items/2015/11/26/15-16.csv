Numpy is a damn good convenience wrapper around the under-the-hood number crunching engines - which themselves are written in static languages.<p>I mean, have you ever tried to _build_ numpy from scratch? That thing pulls in both BLAS and LAPACK, some of the most heavily optimised libraries in the world. These fortran(!) libraries can trace their ancestry all the way to 1970&#x27;s, and have benefited from aggressive optimisations done over the course of 4 decades. [0,1]<p>So, invoking numpy as a testament to power of dynamic languages misses a pretty important point. And I say that as someone who loves Python, and uses it as a first-choice tool in perhaps 90% of use cases.<p>0: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprogra...</a><p>1: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK</a>",1448553480

10633452,comment,10631561,10631713,0,0,TimJYoung,,,"Great blog post.  One point, though:  the reason that you got a segfault with your FillChar on the array isn&#x27;t because you used a dynamic array instead of static array.  Dynamic arrays are just like pointers in terms of how the compiler handles them (the element count is a negative offset from the actual start of the elements, and there are other things like reference counts there also).  The reason you got the segfault is because FillChar operates <i>directly</i> on the passed variable.  In other words, your FillChar zeroed out the first 4 bytes of the pointer (not good) and then kept right on zeroing out memory that didn&#x27;t belong to it (definitely not good).  The reason the:<p>array[0]<p>notation worked is because subscript references are equivalent to referencing the first element in the array like a variable.  Therefore the FillChar started from there and properly filled the rest of the array.",1448553409

If you want to live in a low density area and have to drive everywhere, then no, you&#x27;re not likely to have any mass transit other than a suburb commuter train to go downtown. The alternative is living in smaller, high density housing where there are two grocery stores, three coffee shops, a half dozen restaurants, a pharmacy, a metro station and so on within a five minute walking radius, and have a fifteen minute commute to work by foot or five minutes by bike, so there&#x27;s not that much transit required.<p>The funny thing is, if we go back to the point that started this discussion, the city of Montréal actually has a decent public transit system, a bike share system, 400 miles of bike paths and is one of the most bike-friendly cities in North America (depending on what source you believe).<p>For those US cities that have low density sprawl (such as LA), there&#x27;s no real way to have a transportation infrastructure that makes sense; people who are from LA will say it&#x27;s fine, you just drive wherever you want, whereas Europeans will say it&#x27;s not a city that you can live in because you spend your life in a car and can&#x27;t go out and grab a coffee or pastry with a short walk.<p>Self driving cars don&#x27;t really solve that problem, because you&#x27;ll still have thousands of people going to work at roughly the same time, and even though self-driving cars can have higher density and traffic fluidity than human-controlled ones, they still pale in comparison to mass transit systems.<p>For example, look at Tokyo; it has at least five train stations that have a ridership over one million passengers per day and has a ridership of over forty million (granted, that number counts people switching transit systems multiple times). If you assume that the minimum surface area that a self-driving car could have is nine square feet (3x3), slightly more than a chair moving around would have, and that you need 5 million of them to have an adequate amount of service, just the surface area of all of these cars, bumper to bumper, is 1.6 square miles.

Such infrastructure for &quot;earthquake notification&quot; could just be a few thousand lines or even mostly &quot;glue&quot; code.<p>In total Openstack encompasses around +4M SLOC written in Python. How much is deployed in a given cloud depends on the configuration. However the community must still shepherd and manage all of that code and make regular, stable releases on a six-month cadence.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;just&quot; glue code.<p>> As you say &quot;It does rely on systems written in static languages and is itself written in one&quot; which kind of refutes the whole argument, doesn&#x27;t it?<p>Not necessarily. Awk was necessarily written because querying unstructured input is a huge pain in plain C. Kernighan gave a recent example of this in one of his recent talks on programming language design.<p>The caveat is there is a limit at which adding more lines to an awk program becomes counter-productive. It&#x27;s essentially a good DSL but a terrible language. I think Python defies that -- with the millions of lines of code managed by the community of thousands of developers a large system written in a dynamic language <i>isn&#x27;t</i> impossible or necessarily hindered by its lack of static type analysis.<p>> For those cases couldn&#x27;t one just use a DSL or at worse an sandboxed isolated dynamic language from inside a STL talking care for the rest of the system?<p>In some sense this is how I view Python and languages of its kind... but I think in practice it&#x27;s more of a philosophical viewpoint. In practice dynamic languages are general purpose and much suited to certain kinds of programming that static languages are not.<p>Common Lisp and Smalltalk are great examples of dynamic languages kicking butt. Starting in the debugger and developing self-introspecting systems has a peculiar effect on the programmer. One tends to develop a domain language for solving a class of problems in order to make them tractable. One thing I dislike however is how divorced it can be from the machine. Some Common Lisp compilers can produce really awesome code but it does take a little more burden from the programmer to gain such efficiency from the compiler (compared to the tactical omissions of defined behavior from languages like C which allow almost trivial optimizations... with the trade off that certain errors are quite likely on my part if I&#x27;m not careful).<p>I think there is room for both in the world. I really enjoy OCaml, C, Python, and Common Lisp... and I would seriously consider the problem before the language. Our job after all is to transform data and not spend time writing pretty, elegant, or clever code for the code&#x27;s sake.<p><i>update</i>: grammar.",1448552517

It is not hard to fulfill your daily protein needs and get in all your essential amino acids and maintain a healthy calorie intake while eating a diet of legumes, grains, and vegetables. It can be done for a fraction of the price of a omnivore&#x27;s diet and can be a lot better nutritionally than downing tuna every day (i.e., there&#x27;s more opportunities for variety).<p>> there&#x27;s probably no reasonable definition of sentience that includes all animals and excludes all plants.<p>There are a few, but it actually is largely irrelevant. If you stop eating animals you also consume less plants. Every time you eat an animal you have to consider that in order to raise that animal it had to eat a lot of plants that you could&#x27;ve been eating instead. Raising animals is massively inefficient energy-wise, which is why our plant consumption goes down when people stop eating meat.<p>So really there&#x27;s no need to draw a &quot;sentience line&quot; in the sand. Assuming everything is sentient, vegetarian diets are better for both plants and animals. But even if it were necessary to draw this sort of line, it would make a fair deal of sense to say that anything without a nervous system is at least relatively less likely to be sentient. There are some arguments for plant sentience due to their limited molecular signalling responses to harmful stimuli, but there is definitely a lot less evidence to support that hypothesis than there is to support the hypothesis that tuna are sentient.",1448551542

At any rate, I believe it&#x27;s fair to say that a sentient being can be described as conscious due to their ability to feel and subjectively process experiences.<p>Why does consciousness matter if you believe they are sentient? Are you perhaps conflating intelligence with consciousness? Do you believe that it matters more when an intelligent animal suffers than it does when a less intelligent animal suffers? Why? Do they not both suffer? Can the same be said for people with low IQs? Their suffering matters less than mine?<p>How do you reconcile that slaughterhouse conditions are torturous, even the ones that &quot;ethical farmers&quot; use?

That the process by which they are &quot;humanely&quot; anaesthetized/killed (e.g., bolt gun) is still by far not the most humane way to kill animals?<p>How about the fact we have every reason to believe pigs are incredibly intelligent despite the way we treat them (I&#x27;m talking Chimpanzee-level intelligence here — <a href=""http://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1042&context=acwp_asie"" rel=""nofollow"">http://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?artic...</a>)?

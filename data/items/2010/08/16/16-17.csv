You've got to take a look at the mid-section of the app store rankings to get a feel for what the real, unhyped apps are doing, and why they are successful.<p>What I mean is, take a look at the apps at #75 to #150 on the app store chart. You get a good cross-section of apps in all categories _and_ price points. Let's also remember that, if figures from past blog entries about app store sales-to-rank correlations generally hold true from day to day, apps in that mid-section are generally getting between 400 to 1000 sales a day. Link that to a sales price of, say, 4.99, and you're looking at some serious money per diem, even after Apple's cut.<p>That's where the true beauty of the ""Gross sales"" chart comes into use. It's less of a popularity contest or crapshoot, because I've seen indie companies with little to almost no brand relevance clinging to that mid-section rankings for well over a year, and some of them are priced above 99 cents (in a few instances, well above).<p>What it really boils down to is quality. If you don't have anything worth selling, I guess no one will buy it. Furthermore, it's really hard to determine if what you're doing is worth buying to the general iPhone or Android smartphone user. Put another way, if you take everyone playing in your space, would _you_ choose your work over the competition? If not, why not? Because I can tell you this right now: Most, if not all, of the apps that have ever kissed the top 10 rankings on the app store were made by 2-4 person teams and took a few months of full-time work to complete. The ones that stick around update _constantly_ or are established brands. There are some flash in the pans that make it to the top but if you look closer, they are either building hype elsewhere (such as with a free facebook or flash app) or fills a niche in Utilities that heretofore haven't been well-served.",1281976120

But today that's done by a cool Web site or a higher CPU clock rate or some cute little device that should be a computer but isn't.<p>> Work on how systems behave and work, not just how they compare. Concentrate on interfaces and architecture, not just engineering.<p>> Only one GUI has ever been seriously tried, and its best ideas date from the 1970s. (In some ways, it's been getting worse; today the screen is covered with confusing little pictures.) Surely there are other possibilities. (Linux's interface isn't even as good as Windows!)<p>> There has been much talk about component architectures but only one true success: Unix pipes. It should be possible to build interactive and distributed applications from piece parts.<p>Chrome is an environment for running AJAX web applications and enabling them to talk to each other; among other services, it provides a graphical user interface toolkit (DHTML), a SQL database (SQLite), security mechanism and policy (via tab-per-process, the same-origin policy, incognito mode, and restrictions in the JS engine), a JIT compiler for a language, and process management (both at the user level, with its process viewer, and at the language level with Web Workers). It has a component architecture built in; several of them, actually: iframes, plugins, JSONP.  It is possible in Chrome to build an interactive application from ""piece parts""; this is currently called a ""mashup"".<p>So Chrome is right in the center of the issues Pike's talk was talking about. Much of this, of course, is made of ideas that don't come originally from Chrome; but Chrome is on the cutting edge of making new stuff possible.",1281975166

1608193,comment,1607387,1608085,0,0,jlouis,,,"For all NP-problems, there are trivial instances. As an example the given instance might have structure which effectively makes it a P-problem. What makes NP-problems interesting is that there are also hard instances where the search breaks down and you end up walking an enormous solution space. Most NP-solvers ""cheat"" by looking at the structure of an instance in order to cut down the amount of searching it needs. How good they are depends on how good they are at cutting down the solution space. A lot of research is going into this - which is really a bet on P not equal to NP.<p>The KNAPSACK problem is one of the ""weak"" NP problems in the sense that there is a pseudo-polynomial solution, see<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-polynomial_time"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-polynomial_time</a><p>Intuitively, this means that KNAPSACK is still hard, but is easier than most other NP problems. Pisingers codes are so good that for most inputs the algorithm actually terminates quickly. There are still hard instances out there, but there are far between them. This means that a search for a hard instance might actually become rather cumbersome. Further, all realistic instances are probably realistically solvable so the instances we lack are more or less of theoretic interest.<p>So when you call NP-problems hard it is because it has been proven there are some nasty instances among them for which even the most clever NP-solver algorithm for the problem gives up and resorts to basically searching the whole solution space in exponential time.",1281974903

It might be worth trying a 3 month consulting gig and then, after saving that money, try 3 months on the road as a nomad and see if you can earn money consulting that way.

There is a very large development community outside of RoR and Clojure and Python and what have you that has <i>very</i> little overlap.<p>The Ruby/Python/PHP/etc. development communities coincide a lot. They have UNIX-like operating systems in common. They have certain shared values of what software development means to the human condition. Hell, they <i>think</i> about what software development means to the human condition. It's very future-centric.<p>In the Windows world, it's different. We think about things in terms of the present: what are we doing now, how does this fill my belly, how am I going to fulfill this client request so I can go home and play with my kids. We don't tend to participate in open source projects. Most of the time, it's weird to have someone ask to see my source code. Seeing the source code is a waste of time when all I want is the functionality. There is not much thought to future developers because future developers are likely not going to ever look at what we've made. Even if they did, they're more likely to throw it away and start over than to do anything with it.<p>I don't think there is an inherent ""betterness"" to one approach over the other. To me, it's the difference between a sculpture and a building contractor. A project manager with no technical background working at a bank is a comical character to the auteur, to the contractor he or she is a real person (maybe even a close friend) with a need.<p>But because of these differences, there is shockingly little overlap between the communities. I'm reminded of this any time I hang out with my friends at my local hackerspace. There are a few of us who are Windows developers who can work together very productively. There are others of us who are Linux developers and they can work together very productively. When the two try to mix at all, the minority group on the project invariably look like idiots, lost children, who haven't the experience they claim to have. The problem is the complete mindset disconnect.<p>I think that's where a lot of these ""X is dead, long live Y"" come from.

My uncle owns a few child care centers in the North-East. He <i>never</i> hires male employees. Why? Because the one he did a few years back was very soon accused of pheadophilia by one of the mothers. She didn't like the way he changed diapers on her daughter. Then my uncle learned it happens all the time with the child care centers. The mothers will sue as soon as they realize a male is hired. They accuse of peadophilia hoping to get good ROI on their action. That's why you'll never see a male in a child care center in the US, my friend. Because the mothers apparently are sexist. Or the courts. Or you tell me.<p>>And no, ideally, I would want the law to be gender-blind and >personally I couldnt care less about the gender of the >person one day taking care of my child.<p>The problem is that the most people are not you.

The stream is a graph of co-routines essentially (although typically with only one input and many possible buckets).

Some women find meetups specifically aimed at discussing issues related to women in technology useful, and others don't. The woman who wrote this article doesn't, and appears to be generalizing, based on a rather limited understanding of feminism and not having even attended the event in question, to argue that no other woman should either.<p>You find some similar splits of opinion relating to LGBT organizations: some people join them, attend events, etc., while others studiously avoid them and sometimes even resent their existence or any implication that they should attend.",1367492562

It's better to think of it as the subset of sexism which occurs in the technology industry.<p>Before downplaying the significance of this it's probably good to keep in mind though that if you're a straight, white, western male, there's a good chance you underestimate the effects of being on the 'losing side' of any one of those axes.<p>As for the article, I can imagine that being labeled this way can be annoying, but it's important to keep in mind that these events are there for the women that <i>do</i> have trouble with these issues and/or for when you <i>do</i> run into trouble.<p>What many people often forget is that while these issues you hear about may not be present in your life at the moment, it's fairly easy for some new arrivals in your company to change the atmosphere into something hostile and hurtful to you.

No one wants to work for an all-male company, just as no one wants to work for an all-female company. There's not even really a need to look at the market opportunities side of things. Balance is just more comfortable for everyone.<p>If you're creating a company and planning you're hiring, and you're not a jerk, you probably <i>are</i> worried about keeping some kind of balance.",1367492445

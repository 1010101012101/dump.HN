953397,comment,952256,952547,0,0,warfangle,,,"Likewise for me, in Brooklyn. Of course, I only have one coffee shop around - but I know several of the baristas there (one is in a great local band, Pass Kontrol), and often see the bartenders from the bistro-bar down the block (whom I also know fairly well). Add to that the fact that the coffee shop has a ""bottomless cup"" option with cheap refills, and I find myself dividing my time like this:<p>When I need to do a lot of photoshop work (slicing, dicing, css, et cetera), I work from home where I have a large monitor. When I need to do a lot of code work, I take my laptop down to the coffee shop.<p>Wish I could stick my desk in the living room, but there really isn't any room! It is perpendicular to my south-east-facing window, though, so I get a lot of natural light which seems to help my mood quite a bit.<p>I couldn't imagine working from home if I lived in a suburb, though. The occasional ten minute breaks (when I'm out of home, instead of out of the coffee shop) to go down and get a cup (or just to have a smoke) are quite nice, because I see a lot of people that I know from the neighborhood. I wouldn't be able to get that, no how no way, out of a suburb.",1258750728

The best security researchers are people who have (or at least could) ship software. There is a big swath of high-end work that you simply can't deliver if you can't code. That's where Matasano plays. I suppose you could be a very strong Payment Card Industry certification consultant just by getting very good with WebInspect, but to reverse an embedded kernel, isolate the code that handles a protocol you caught on the wire, and then code a fuzzer for that protocol, you need to be able to read code in a bunch of languages and write code very well in at least one of them.<p>As a consultancy, there are fringe benefits to our clients from us staffing projects with former devs:<p>* Devs know how to talk to other devs without sounding like morons or bureaucratic checklist-checkers, and sounding like that is a big problem in my industry. For instance, devs don't tell clients that single-line changes to shipping codebases are ""trivial"" and should only take minutes to roll out.<p>* Devs can provide remediation advice that is better than ""switch to parameterized prepared statements"" or ""check input better"".<p>But the reality is, we like working with devs because they are on the whole better at breaking software. They read faster, they don't balk at writing complicated test programs, and they know how pieces fit together --- and those junctions are where software usually fails worst.",1258748550

Door greeters know nothing of running a giant corporation (at least most of them). The results certainly have major impacts on the door greeters' livelihoods, but they're not qualified to make decisions like who should be the COO, or should the stock split 2:1, or how many stores they should open in China next year.<p>It's much the same with science. If you let the hoi polloi decide what we should do about the global warming issue (or lack thereof) you're going to get a result not based on science or economics, but based on whether more people believe Hollywood actors or radio talk show hosts, neither of whom know the slightest thing about it either.<p>As a concerned tax-payer that is exactly what I'd like to avoid. All of that is, of course, way off-topic, which is ironic in a thread where I initially exclaimed that these sorts of posts are off-topic :)",1258747506

They have created a very efficient cooling system for data centers. The startup has two mechanical engineers that have built a prototype that is getting awesome results. You'd be the main software person.

I spend 90% of my programming time in front of my terminal - so it makes sense for me to optimize for that case instead of the general case.<p>When I program on a different keyboard/editor I am much slower than normal. I remember one interview I kept trying to use the Emacs kill ring  (C-k) in Eclipse. (I just did a typing test and apparently I do hit about 60WPM on my laptop keyboard - but that's about half my real speed ...).",1258747392

The Objective-C runtime allows dynamic method calls, using performSelector: which takes a selector name, which can be constructed from any random string. This basically means any static analysis tool can be trivially fooled. Apple might as well start rejecting all apps which use any ""features"" of their runtime.<p>Who cares whether a method was overridden or called or whatever -- if it's in the runtime it can be invoked.",1258747258

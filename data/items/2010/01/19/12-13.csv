1062005,comment,1061129,1061640,0,0,gjm11,,,"Right idea, wrong execution. If 64^N = 361^M then N log 64 = M log 361, so M = (log 64 / log 361) N ~= 0.71N. So if you could look 12 moves ahead in chess, this estimate would say you could manage 8 or 9 moves in go.<p>Unfortunately, it's worse than this. In practice, the effective branching factor in a chess tree-search is more like 3 than 64, roughly because lots of moves can quickly be found to be bad. I would be very surprised if the corresponding figure for go were less than, say, 30. So now your factor is log 3 / log 30, or more like 1/3.<p>On top of that, go games are much longer than chess games, so your search depth in go is a much smaller fraction of the whole game, so the search is a worse proxy for the final result. Slightly related to that: there's no nice simple measurement of how well you're doing that's comparable to measuring material in chess. (Your ultimate goal is to build territory, but it takes quite a while before any sort of quantitative estimate of how much territory each player has is feasible, especially if you want it to be anywhere near as cheap as a material count in chess.)",1263905829

Then they can either be used to drive a synth or you can take the normal analog out.<p>MIDI drum pads or MIDI triggers on acoustic drums are also common.<p>I think much of the appeal for musicians with many years of playing behind them is that they don't have to master a new interface for music input.  I've played bass for 15 years; I can do a lot of phrasing intuitively that's much more tedious to enter by hand into a sequencer or to play on an electronic-specialized instrument that I don't have mastery of.  Granted, I don't actually have a MIDI bass pickup, but I've been tempted.<p>In Squarepusher's music, for example, you can often hear in his synth lines that they were played on an electric bass (which he's exceptional at) because the phrasing is much more idiomatic to an electric bass than to a keyboard.",1263905066

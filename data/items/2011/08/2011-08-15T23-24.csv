developed since the time of Euler, Navier and Stokes (from the 1750s to the 1850s). These
developments have led to the so-called Navier-Stokes Equations, a precise mathematical
model for most fluid flows occurring in Nature. These equations, however, only admit analytical
solutions in very simple cases. No progress was therefore made until the 1950s when
researchers started to use computers and develop numerical algorithms to solve the
equations. In general, these algorithms strive for accuracy and are fairly complex and time
consuming. This is because the applications that require these solvers have to be physically
accurate. It is obviously crucial that the stresses and drag on an airplane or a bridge are
calculated precisely.<p>In computer graphics and in games on the other hand what matters most is that the
simulations both look convincing and are fast. In addition it is important that the solvers arent
too complex so that they can be implemented on standard PCs, game consoles or PDAs. In
this paper we present a set of algorithms which meet these requirements. To achieve these
goals we depart from conventional wisdom in computational physics and develop algorithms
custom tailored for creating visual effects. Unlike physically accurate solvers which have strict
bounds on their time steps, our algorithms are stable, and never blow up.",1313451389

Is s/he respected in the tech sector, involved with the company or its underwriters, has s/he invested in 1 successful IPO, 10, or 100? I'm sure you added this information because you consider the person's judgment worth sharing, but in any sample of 10 professional investors you'll be able to find a true believer and a skeptic.<p>I'm sorry my commentary came off as dismissive or hurtful. It just didn't 'click' with me, but maybe other people will find it useful in a way I didn't.",1313449437

Simply saying you'd raise taxes on folks making more than a million of taxable income a year doesn't really say very much.<p>It's saying a huge amount. The Republican position is that tax increases are COMPLETELY off the table (and they are defining closing tax loopholes as tax increases). Buffet is saying that tax increases should be on the table, and that the current tax system results in people at his wealth level paying a smaller percentage of their income as taxes than people in the middle class and that he doesn't think this is fair and that it should be possible to change this without dire consequences.<p>You seem to be dismissing this because he has not proposed detailed legislation to overhaul the tax code.",1313449420

The kid will probably grow up and sling sulfuric acid on his girl friends face.

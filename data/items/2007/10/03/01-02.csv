The other guy was pissed because he doesn't seem to have any talent of his own and considers the hacker <i>his</i>, an obviously absurd position.  <p>This isn't high school, it's business, and if you're going to cry every time someone approaches your talent, you don't belong in business.  If your hacker leaves you for another position, it's your fault, not the guy who hired him.<p>Though responding publicly was a bad move.",1191376583

""You have no idea what is going to succeed.""</i><p>(Guy passed up on Yahoo and Google.)  I think to someone without the requisite skill necessary to evaluate the technology and people it's like a crapshoot, sure.<p>However, I think a more accurate analogy would be that it's poker.  Luck is a factor but it's dominated by skill (execution).  If you're not an expert player then it <i>seems</i> like it's all luck; but expert players finish at or near the top over and over again.<p>Start-ups are like players that don't have a track record, so you have to watch their play carefully to decide if they're good or not.  But in order to do that accurately you have to be an expert yourself.\n",1191374027

62377,story,,,5,2,palish,"Beautiful Programming Quote",,"""If you're doing top-down design, you produce a specification that stops at some level of granularity.  And you always risk discovering, come implementation time, that the module or class that was the lowest level of your specification hides untold worlds of complexity that will take as much development effort as you'd budgeted for the rest of the project combined.  The only way to avoid that is to have your design go all the way down to specifying individual lines of code, in which case you aren't designing at all, you're just programming.""<p><a href=""http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:ysongopFAqIJ:gamearchitect.net/Articles/SoftwareIsHard.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:ysongopFAqIJ:gamearchite...</a>",1191373763

62370,comment,62348,62348,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I've been told explicitly by several people <i>not</i> to finance an early stage startup with debt. I second utnick's suggestion to try to find other ways to make ends meet, until you can land some angel investment (in the form of equity financing). Not only can debt ruin your life if the startup fails, but a lot of debt can look bad on your books if you reach the point of looking for outside investment.<p>I recently learned about Certified Capital Companies (CAPCOS), which are government backed organizations that look like banks, but their investment turns into equity like an Angel or VC investment. Apparently they are still very conservative in their investments though, and may not have very desirable terms. But at least this is better than taking on a lot of debt. I dont know much about them, but they might be worth looking into if they are available in your state.<p>",1191373289

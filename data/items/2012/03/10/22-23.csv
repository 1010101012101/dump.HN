3688955,comment,3687744,3688254,1,0,sirclueless,,,"Yep, this is an endemic problem with end-to-end verifiable elections everywhere: it is easy to invalidate whole segments of votes. For example, in the wombat voting scheme, if one of the people who holds a decryption key refuses to divulge it, perhaps by ""losing"" their key, they can invalidate the whole election. Typically to minimize the chance of this happening you make sure that everyone with a key has a strong commitment to the election and make not divulging the key a public shaming event. ""OMG, the Democratic Party refuses to decrypt the vote in this Republican-dominated area -- they must be corrupt!""<p>It's an awfully sticky situation, because the A (availability) in the CIA principle is so critical in elections, where it typically is compromised the most in encryption schemes.

There's give & take on each individual issue, and one person is the winner and one person is the loser on that particular issue, and you don't have the flexibility to make sure you win on the issues you care about and lose on the ones you don't.<p>When you treat the agreement as a whole, you can look at it as an effort in prioritization.  Each side will care more about certain issues.  You want each side to win on the issues they care about, and lose on the ones that they don't.

While it's great to think about a future in which this technology is safe and widely available, it seems to me I'm being attacked for simply asking basic security questions that I would ask about any large system that was going through trials prior to mass rollout. And rather than hearing any specific answers, I'm just being attacked and voted down. I think anyone who's spent time in IT would probably ask these things first before they deployed a new system in their company office, so I don't think it's unreasonable to ask them about about a potentially game-changing social innovation.[/EDIT]<p>That's true. But blowing up a diesel truck is hard to do remotely, and requires someone to actively attack at a specific place and time.<p>I'm not sure why I got downrated for my post; I'm just asking, doesn't this create a lot of security holes and attack vectors that need to be studied before allowing it? I mean, I haven't heard anything about security, at all. The focus seems to be on a safe driving experience, but where's the white paper on counter-hacking measures? Can you imagine if Google launched Gmail without any kind of plan to mitigate stolen passwords or hijacked accounts? As it is, there are plenty of people who <i>do</i> have their accounts hijacked. Luckily, that doesn't lead to collisions and deaths.<p>Consider for a moment how many people run Windows and IE, with the latest security updates, who are still vulnerable to zero day exploits. Consider how many don't update their software and get swept up in botnets a few days later. Now imagine each and every compromised PC has physical control over 2-3 tons of rolling aluminum and steel, that can go anywhere on a public highway, with human beings inside it.<p>An attacker who had taken control over a botnet of compromised autonomous carscould drive swarms of them wherever they wanted by remote control.<p>Now, rather than downvote me, tell me what security protocols will be in place to prevent the scenarios I've outlined.",1331420011

You should improve yourself (if that's what you want), but don't become obsessed with improvement. There are other worthwhile and meaningful ways of living - just consider other options.<p>I'm afraid to sound new-agist ('cause I'm not), but let me suggest that the desire to improve is often the result of an external motivation such as competition. Also, ""success"", and ""improvement"" are common words in corporate-speak for two reasons: people who build corporations are often those who are obsessed with success to begin with, and second, people thinking about success and improvement tend to make better employees and better consumers. In general, people overly concerned with success and/or improvement either create authority or serve it well.<p>So improving yourself is certainly a great goal, but as you do it, make sure that you're improving yourself in order to serve yourself and those you love better - not someone else.",1331419888

The ""atrocious metrics"" you refer to were not created by the free market, but by the very same people who created them in the parable-- commissars.<p>For instance, in 2001-2002, after the dotcom crash, I knew there was going to be a housing boom because the federal reserve made the cost of money lower than the rate of monetary inflation. (I didn't figure this out myself, though, but learned it from some wise economists.)  Banks were incentivized to lend as much as possible, because a housing boom is what the commissars wanted (Paul Krugman wrote about it, for instance.)  This created a lot of jobs and while it also created the real estate bubble and consequential crash, it was good for the Bush administration.<p>The interest rates, the regulations on banks, and the inflation rate are all metrics created by the government.  The low rates and high inflation are metrics that created a carry trade. The Clinton era changes in regulations[1] incentivized loaning money to people who could not repay it. Of course the FDIC, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are all government entities that distorted the market and created moral hazard.<p>Simply eliminating the FDIC (but requiring banks to have deposit insurance) would have mitigated a lot of damage- the banks who were way over levered would have seen their deposit insurance rates go up, and thus be incentivized to not be over levered.<p>It is not that our economy is immune to the impact of commissars.  Our economy is ruled by commissars... we just pretend it isn't.<p>If we want to eliminate arbitrary formulas like the ones in the parable, balancing the federal government (removing much of the need for inflation) and letting interest rates float in the market (rather than be controlled by the privately owned Federal Reserve corporation) would help.<p>However, just like the situation in Communist era Poland in the parable, there are major political movements who think this is crazy talk and would like to spin these economic failings as proof that we need more commissars, not less. I can point to many members of both political parties in the USA who feel this way.<p>[1] Early in the Clinton era there was a lot of muckraking about how banks were not loaning to ethnic minorities.

The efficiency gains would justify the expenditures. The US economy will be made over by robots; we have the most efficient, large production economy on the planet, and are still the world's largest manufacturing nation (ahead of China, we export less).<p>Our labor force participation rate has dropped from 67.5% in 1999/2000, down to 64% now; our U6 unemployment number is 15%. Millions of net job gains by taking manufacturing back from China, would not destroy many jobs at all (domestically), quite the opposite.<p>Robots are amplifiers of human labor, not replacements. They still must be created, cared for, upgraded, overseen, and so on. The whole point is about one American with 30 robots to manage, becoming as labor efficient on price to output as 30 or more Chinese workers. The improvement scale in robotics is almost limitless; direct human labor however is extraordinarily limited in its capabilities.<p>5 million new jobs courtesy of taking manufacturing back from China would instantly push our labor force participation rate back up to where it was in 1999. While we'd simultaneously generate a massive pool of new domestic wealth by keeping that money here instead of sending it elsewhere for someone else to benefit from. We'd make more of the goods we consume; and we'd export more goods to the rest of the world. Competing with China is just one example, the reality is we'd want to look to create jobs by competing with everywhere we've lost manufacturing to since 1964 when America had 55% of all global manufacturing.<p>And then let's remember that efficiency gains produce more wealth. Wealth is not a static pool to be swapped or stolen back and forth. Neither are jobs. It's entirely likely that we'll be able to create entirely new products that are now impossible courtesy of advanced robotic manufacturing, and that will mean completely new jobs, that would not have existed otherwise (versus say taking back old product manufacturing from China or similar).",1331418822

This is definitely a huge issue that is going to need serious thought in the coming years.<p>We're going to need to do some more serious big thinking about more than ""work"", which is too narrow now. We need to figure how how we're going to ""occupy"" people in the transition from post-industrial/service/information technology society to a roboticized, post-scarcity, arts and leisure society. If handled poorly, ""social unrest"", mass protests, and outright violence may be become a regular part of the landscape, what with millions of always-idle, impoverished people just sitting on the sidelines, ignored. How long could this last? One hundred years, perhaps? That's a really long time to have constant social upheaval.<p>Sci-fi has dystopias full of rebellious robots, human vs. robot warfare, grappling with what it means to be sentient, etc. but have startlingly little that deals with a much more realistic question: what does a society where human labor is being made redundant look like in terms of day-to-day human behavior? Over the coming years, the consequences of mass automation and even ""stupid"" AI are going to come to a fore.<p>Ok, so what are things we're going to need to do? Encouraging the arts and music, competitive games, and various leisure activities, are probably a given (and not much encouragement is likely to even be necessary, since many will do these things on their own given the ability to do so.) The other piece of the puzzle is the one that's really going to need a great deal of thought: how do we support them, and just as importantly, how do we run an economy where 40, 50, 60 of the population does not work (and thus, under the current system, have no income)? The most obvious answer is to move towards a massive expansion of what we currently call the ""welfare"" state along with planned population policies (hard, but probably necessary.) The big difference? We'll be not just supporting jobless people, but the economy itself (we can call it econofare or something.) What kind of economy can you have with few consumers? Not much of one. It will require a completely different perspective, one where it's not a bunch of unfortunate (or lazy, depending on your perspective) jobless people, but a bunch of people we essentially pay to be consumers. Items which are scarce will need special handling for sure (hopefully things like food and shelter can be made superabundant sooner than later), but for everything else, it'll be all about simply keeping the flow of money going. The main policy prescription here is the tax-free guaranteed income, like they have in certain Scandinavian countries (someone else in these comments mentioned this.)<p>That all said, the two types of jobs I would put on ""won't be automated anytime soon"" list:<p>1) Jobs that exist to make others feel powerful/superior. Waiters, house-servants, massage therapists. They do have jobs that could certainly be automated, but you don't get the same feeling of ""lording over"" others with robots that you do with people. Robots /will/ do these jobs for many, perhaps even most people on a day-to-day basis, but there will likely still be people who pay for this as an ""experience.""<p>2) Interdisciplinary generalists (i.e., modern Jacks-of-all-trades.) This job isn't a single ""job"" at all, but a collection of jobs requiring the understanding and ability to synthesize knowledge from different (and sometimes disparate) areas. We will continue to automate parts of specific types of cross-discipline ""tasks"", but we won't be automating the big-picture viewers.",1331418187

Made me cringe in recollection at a few times in my life.<p>Interestingly enough though, my most adversarial negotiation of my life went like this (caught partner embezzling funds after he'd had a personal finance crisis)... interestingly, that one was wound down by email and fax with entirety of the agreement like this, and was the most successful. I didn't get this point back then (I still screw it up, actually, by trying to proactively ""fix"" things and oftentimes taking things at face value that are just leverage/negotiating moves). Yet -- I got lucky. My ex-partner's father was a lawyer, so we just faxed/emailed drafts back and forth.<p>That one came out OK, good outcomes even. Many other situations I had a much better position and better odds, but did poorly since I compromised/conceded/""helped""/""fixed"" too early and set an expectation that things would continue that way.<p>Hmm. Expectations are a funny thing.<p>This is a really great article. Anyone who thinks it's not relevant to them should read it twice, since it covers a hell of a lot of life.

It would entirely change their time if they weren't stopping in motels and getting there mid-day on a saturday. If they had a driverless vehicle, they would get there at 6 in the morning and be fully rested.<p>Greatly increased speed limits is what excites me the most if only because it's the next step in making our physical world that little bit smaller.

There could also be a good point that OOP should be the very first thing a student should learn, but only if you teach them a smalltalk based language, not python, java, C++ etc.<p>For the context of my argument, I chose: 'for teaching first year CS majors their first procedural programming language, what is the best choice?'",1331416896

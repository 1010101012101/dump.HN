I suppose that means at a fundamental level, the problem is shifting budgeting from one line item to another is a PITA.<p>I don't think it's anything to do with marketing.  I just grabbed Wendy's as an example, but I also recently ended up at a relatively fancy restaurant I'd never heard of before walking in their front door, and I spent more on a single glass of wine there than that album would have cost.  On some level, I think it comes down to feeling like food is a necessity and buying more music is not.  But at the same time, if you'd offered me the choice (""Don't buy the wine and you can buy the album"") I'd have taken the album for sure.",1322492391

They need to be told what to do..otherwise nothing will get done.  Owning a business requires self-discipline and many people just don't have it.<p>""but so are most successful businesses""<p>It depends on how you define success.

I got tired of it.  I got tired of being forced to ask someone if I can take a day off of work to go to the doctor or visit family after Christmas.  It felt just like when I was in school.  I suppose school is good training for real life.<p>As a business owner, I have more freedom.  There are many times when I don't want to work on something, but it's still enjoyable to me because it's mine.  Life also seems to pass by much slower.  I don't feel like I'm wasting my life.<p>The downside is that I have more responsibility (if you can call it a downside).

3286062,comment,3284169,3285880,3,0,qlkzy,,,"Again, I'm not a psychologist, so this is only my (limited) interpretation of what I've read.<p>I'm not saying that there is <i>no</i> nature-component. <i>But</i>, (AFAIK) there is no real evidence for something that would correspond to some idea of 'Raw Smarts' that (a) has a meaningfully large effect compared to practice and experience, and (b) generalises.<p>What I've read suggests that, yes, there are a whole bunch of nature-components and nurture-components which initially serve to differentiate ability in young children. But the direct effects of these get quite rapidly dominated by the feedback loop of ability->motivation->practice->ability. So there's an initial differentiation - because of a subtle difference in brain chemistry, or earlier maturation, or better access to books, or competition with high-achieving siblings :); but in the longer term, there's a pretty consistent picture that excellence and ability at a high level is dominated by deliberate practice and sustained effort over time.<p>Of course, psychology research is hard to separate from its social context and underlying cultural assumptions, and it may just be that our egalitarian culture is uncomfortable with the idea of innate ability dominating, and steers research accordingly. Or I may just be missing the point entirely.<p>The essence of my point is that, as things currently stand, the research suggests that innate ability is not a significant component of ultimate achievement, and that we should therefore not predicate our approach to education upon the idea that it is dominant (which is what the comment I was replying to seemed to suggest).",1322492025
3286060,comment,3285622,3285622,1,0,tristan_louis,,,"First, I would say take a break and get a little perspective.<p>What is the cause of your stress? Is it the work? Is it the lack of traction for your product or company? Is it cash flow? Is it physical exhaustion?<p>Assess the source of that stress and start figuring out why it stresses you out. Then do something about fixing the ""being stressed out"" part by changing your perspective on the problem.<p>Second, realize that number of hours work is not necessarily the best approach. Figure out if you are spending the time efficiently. Figure out what could be done by someone else. Compute the cost of doing some of those other tasks and if the task is non-essential to your business and the cost of the task is higher than what you would pay yourself on an hourly basis, then outsource the sucker.<p>Third, remember that YOU ARE NOT THE PRODUCT. The product is the product and it may need fixing but it's not you, as a person. Get that perspective and start looking at it as something that you put in customer hands, not something that you are. This should greatly alleviate the stress.<p>Now go on to 40 (and beyond) with those concepts in mind. It took me until a second stay in the hospital at age 39 to realize that I was doing it wrong. I had burned myself out a few times (12 hours? pfft... try 18!) and after a near-death experience, realized that I could do a better job by refocusing. My new company, as a result, is moving along nicely and I believe it will succeed but I also realize there will be bumps in the road along the way and those are part of the natural course of things when growing a business.",1322491937

""Think of all the X"" just invites the availability heuristic. You immediately think of the products that became huge successes and introduced something new into the mainstream. Successful but boring products don't come to mind because they're boring, and the failed but novel products don't come to mind because you never heard of them. Averaged over the whole industry, I would guess that new products need a fairly small amount of originality, and adding more is correlated with failure.<p>If you want to be the best in your area, by all means go the extra mile to understand the problem deeply. But if you want to be good enough in 20 different areas, your best bet is to be a copycat in all of them, because originality is expensive and risky and your resources are not infinite.",1322491893

An additional analysis suggests that incorrect analyses of interactions are even more common in cellular and molecular neuroscience."" In other words, half the time when the specific issue came up, the neuroscience authors got the procedure wrong.<p>AFTER EDIT: Meanwhile, a lot of other interesting comments have mentioned the role of statistics education or math-aversion in higher education in various disciplines. I'll comment here about some things I've learned about statistics since I completed my higher education, things I've self-educated about as a homeschooling parent for the last two decades and now a mathematics teacher in private practice.<p>First of all, even when undergraduate students take courses in statistics, the courses are not likely to be very helpful. Many statistics textbooks used in colleges are poorly chosen<p><a href=""http://statland.org/MAAFIXED.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statland.org/MAAFIXED.PDF</a><p>and many statistics courses are taught by professors who themselves have very poor backgrounds in statistics, so the essential point that statistics is all about DATA never gets emphasized. Moreover, the undergraduate statistics curriculum historically has emphasized the wrong issues about valid inference<p><a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz</a><p>and most undergraduates who complete one or two statistics courses still have a very weak sense of what valid statistical inference is.<p>And all of this is not even to get into issues such as Bayesian versus frequentist approaches to statistics<p><a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes</a><p>in modeling reality. Yes, biologists need to get over fear of mathematics for biology to progress as a science,<p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/apr/16/mathematics-of-life-ian-stewart-review"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/apr/16/mathematics-of-l...</a><p>and everyone can gain by learning more about statistics,<p><a href=""http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1928"" rel=""nofollow"">http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=192...</a><p>but statistics education isn't easy, and it can still be greatly improved even for the students who do step up to take statistics courses.",1322491373

Just because it's buried in a submenu doesn't make it obviously present.<p>2. When a user notices that something doesn't behave as it's expected, he/she won't think: ""oh, let's look in the manual, maybe there's some way to do this"". He'll just think the software is broken.<p>3. Another very true example of this is cut and paste of files. For years you could not cut and paste a file on Mac like in any other OS. Lion adds this, but instead of the simple and obvious Cmd-X, Cmd-V, you have to do Cmd-C, Cmd-Option-V.<p>When a user tries Cmd-X to move a file and discover it doesn't work, you can say he's lazy for not looking up in the manual. Or you can agree that some things are just badly designed, period.

A downside of releasing too often is that all the great reviews you got for the 1.0 will be gone once enough reviews for 1.1 are in. If all you did was drop a bugfix into 1.1, you may not receive as many glowing reviews and your overall app rating will drop. This really sucks, but it's a reality of the ecosystem.",1322491059

No one else I knew could relate); and of course, suicidal ideation. It's interesting to ponder what our lives would have been like had people like the ones in this thread known each other at the time.<p>Anyway, I thought I'd add my ""why I hated school as a gifted child"" list to this thread: This applies to public and private schools, both of which I've attended. This is an NYC-based, personal, anecdotal perspective, and doesn't feature any sort of statistical rigor.<p>* Co-student apathy, class disruptiveness, and disinterest. Seeing other students cheat, fall asleep, space out, not participate, and fail horribly can be a motivation killer.<p>* A predilection toward violence by many students/the constant threat of getting ""jumped"" (less of an issue at private, but not completely eliminated)<p>* Overcrowded classrooms<p>* Teaching to the lowest common denominator. No attempt at tailoring education to individuals or logical groups.<p>* At times, more time spent on attempting to restore order than teaching<p>* A habit of blaming ""everyone involved"" (i.e., anyone in the vicinity) instead of attempting to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of activities that were against regulations. A very ""short-cutty"" attitude towards determining any sort of blame. Nothing resembling due process and no requirements for sound evidence. ""10 guilty men go free"" had no meaning.<p>* Little to no coverage of the source theories or practical future applications of subjects. Much focus on facts, figures, and formulas without any attempt at relating it to the real world, past, present, or future. ""Real world"" examples tended to be laughably contrived. Attempting to glean information about sources/reasoning for the thing's existence often met with angry stares (""you're causing us to veer off the subject and confusing people!"") or simply stopped cold (""it doesn't matter, just learn it"").<p>* Poor facilities and equipment (not an issue at private)<p>* Alternately attempting to paint the currently taught education as a personal enrichment experience (""it's for your own good"") or a necessity for future survival (""learn this or you'll sleep in the street""). Neither perspective was accompanied by anything resembling <i>why</i> or <i>how</i> it was beneficial.<p>* A jarring, cacophonous, impersonal, zoo-like atmosphere. Getting up early, waiting outside in the cold/heat, being stuffed into classrooms/buses/lunchrooms with people who had horrible hygiene; disgusting habits; were loud and obnoxious; were dramatic, crying, whining, moping children; were four feet tall and no life experience, yet filled with endless arrogance and bravado. Blaring bells going off when you're still half asleep. If you were precocious/mature, you tended to feel very uncomfortable and out of place. Arguments about this being like the ""real world"" are complete and utter nonsense; if I don't like a place of work or other institution, I go somewhere else that I like better.<p>* Absolutely horrible food (even at private school!)<p>* Far too much focus on testing rather than the ability to understand and apply knowledge (which goes right along with not attempting to teach how said knowledge could be usefully applied).<p>* Lack of depth. I've learned (and continue to learn) more about subjects researching them on my own than I ever learned about them in school. Perhaps that's a given considering how much time we can personally spend on subjects outside of school, it still seems like schools could do a lot better job of it.",1322490603

To your point, it is indistinguishable from an empty hard drive (or whatever the contents are); there may be a valid issue to discuss, but there is nothing to perceive. Someone asserts there is ""$5M of pirated software"" there; I assert it contains a single trillion-digit random number, and there is nothing there to perceive in differentiation, even in theory - human perception of one data storage device is indistinguishable from a duplicate device containing different data.<p>This ""exhibit"" is qualitatively different from even the ""blank canvas"" ""art"" rhetorical device. The ""1m square, 2 shades of black"" painting I recall from a museum at least was in and of itself meant to be looked at, even if it required 3 pages of explanation to justify its pathetic existence. John Cage's 4'33"" was in fact meant to be heard, though the pianist played no notes. Resounding voids they may have been, yet they were still meant to be perceived.<p>In this instance, the physical artifact could be replaced by any storage device of sufficient capacity. The alleged content may be the same, but the audience cannot perceive it in any way.<p>It's not art. It's a point of discussion.<p>Now, if the ""artist"" had, say, covered a wall with a trillion dots colored corresponding to that alleged data content, we'd have something for humans to perceive for the purpose of perceiving it - to wit, art. The audience could examine, at least in practical theory, the totality of the image and conclude there is something of value there. And if the opposing wall were likewise marked, but instead depicting a single trillion-digit random number, the audience could decide if there were any life-affecting difference between them, or conclude that the creation & viewing was a complete waste of time.",1322489570

Later in college I challenged myself to take it again and ace it. All that stuff I thought was boring, I learned to see it as interesting. As an evolving system. Piecing bits of history together, seeing the evolution of tax systems, or military patterns, or whatever.<p>Eventually, I got to the point where I could afford to travel a bit. And here's where the awesome part comes in. When I went to Athens, I could visualize Hadrian walking through his arch down to the temple of Zeus. Or in Florence, walk the exact same streets as Michelangelo and see exactly where Savonarola was burned to death.<p>In Rhodes I could see the approach the armies of Salah ah-Din had to make to assault the fortress of the Knights of St. John. It wasn't just a wall, or a bunch of bricks, it was a living, breathing piece of history. And knowing the history of it, I felt connected to it.<p>And now that I know that history can be so enlightening, I seek it out where I don't know it. In Korea I learned about King Sejong the Great and why he's great, and suddenly I find I'm interested in linguistics and invented writing systems (great site btw <a href=""http://www.omniglot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.omniglot.com/</a>).

But somehow spending $8 for an MP3 album I've wanted badly for months is an extravagance.<p>For me, part of the problem is family budgeting.  As long as I only do it a few times a month, I won't have to justify $10 for lunch to my wife.   Even though going with a $2 lunch and buying the $8 album would be spending the same amount of money, in practice I'd still be trying to justify the album purchase.<p>Clearly that sucks.  But there's a pretty good reason for it.  If we weren't budgeting, my wife and I would probably buy 20-30 albums a month, and that we cannot afford.  So clamping limits on albums makes very good sense.  But it definitely feels like it leads to non-optimal use of money overall -- we're keeping to a budget, but perhaps not spending the money as well as we could.",1322489297

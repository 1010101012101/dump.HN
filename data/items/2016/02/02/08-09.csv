Albanian, a Thracian language, shares some of the deepest roots of Romanian (tl;dr proto-Romanian was formed through Slavic influences over a local population of Thracian descent that had, in time, adopted Latin) and there are some similarities in vocabulary and grammar, but Albanian sounds completely foreign to Romanian ears, whereas basic Spanish, French or Italian phrases are readily intelligible (with a little mental gymnastics).<p>In fact, owing to its relatively simple grammar and the shared Slavic influences, Serbian is even <i>easier</i> to pick up, although the map puts it farther away than e.g. English.<p>The map is accurate in one regard -- if you ever think you have a knack for learning foreign languages, try your hand at a Fino-Ugric language.

I also have some home-grown components using a mix of Arduino, Particle Photon, Raspberry Pis with cheap Sony PS3 webcams and Arduinos. I&#x27;ll provide an overview here.<p>The Wemo plugs control lamps in the living room and bedroom. Z-Wave is used for Aotec temperature sensors in the bathroom and 1st bedroom.<p>The second bedroom has a Particle Photon hooked up to (I think) a TMP036 (might be a BMP085) and a photoresistor, that publishes temperature and relative light levels to an MQTT broker. A DHT22 is used for humidity and a Parallax PIR clone is used for motion detection. A Nabaztag bunny with an OpenNAB server is used to sarcastically read news and weather to guests if they get up between 8am and 11am.<p>The main bedroom currently just has the Aotec sensor and a Raspberry Pi 2 with Motion and a USB PS3 EyeToy camera. I use this for photographing sunrise and sunset when I&#x27;m at home and monitoring the bedroom when I&#x27;m away. This is plugged into a MotionEye install on a server, and integrated into OpenHAB via motion.<p>The bathroom has an Aotec sensor. I plan to use the humidity check to track when the shower&#x27;s being used but need enough data points to make it reliable. A bluetooth speaker is in the bathroom, the plan is to play music automatically when the shower&#x27;s on.<p>There are philips hue lights in the bedrooms and bathroom.

Creating a drama is, whether intentional, accidental, unexpected or not, very consuming and basically a lose-lose game. If not creating a drama has a serious implication for the project, the project has to think hard about that, but otherwise (especially like this situation where changing the variable name has no other effect whatsoever) I would just accept that. I think the precautionary measure taken by Mozilla [1] on the Brotli Content-Encoding is an excellent example.<p>[1] <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=366559#c147"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=366559#c147</a>",1454400468

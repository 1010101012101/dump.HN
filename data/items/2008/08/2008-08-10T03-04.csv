272136,comment,272081,272081,0,0,schtog,,,"Very, very good idea. I have been looking for away to get more into asian cultures. I have traveled a lot to other places but only have so much time and it is hard to get insight into the lives and minds of other cultures from far away, esp the younger people.<p>So this is a good place to start.<p>Obviously it is very reddit-inspired, both idea and design.
Reddit wasn't the first aggregator though and they are  here to stay in one form or the other so that's fine and I really like the design but it is a little bit to reddit-ish perhaps, looks like a clone.<p>Overall grade: Nice work man!",1218340414
272135,comment,271920,272124,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Doesn't this apply more to the vendor and less to the customer?  The vendor can sell a system and skimp on the added cost of security.  If they are good at managing the account and spinning the situation, when security issues do come up, they have a chance to sell the customer an entirely new system.<p>The customer is probably better off with a spec for proper security in the first place, so they can avoid the cost of refitting or replacing the entire system.",1218340336

It's very easy to sell the government and private organizations a shoddy set of goods.<p>What about institutionalizing white hat hacking, somehow?  I could imagine a system where two competing tiger teams ensure good results.  Basically, pay bonuses for actually breaking the security measures.  If only one team succeeds in breaking in, then they get both team's bonus.",1218339888

4012627,story,,,1,0,noinput,"Thank you for contacting Congressman Calvert [about CISPA]",,"Dear Mr. Carter,<p>Thank you for contacting me regarding cybersecurity legislation currently pending in Congress.  I appreciate the opportunity to respond.<p>Every day, U.S. businesses and the federal government are targeted by foreign governments and businesses for cyber exploitation and theft. As a Member of the House Defense Appropriations Committee and its liaison to the House Permanent Select Intelligence Committee, I have received numerous classified briefings detailing these types of attacks and the kinds of threats they present to our economy and national security.<p>For example, at an unclassified level, the Chinese government has targeted American businesses and stolen (and then copied) pesticide formulas; stolen merger and acquisition information that would allow it to buy or sell stock at large profits; and stolen client lists that will allow it to market its products in direct competition.  These actions have resulted in the loss of huge quantities of valuable intellectual property and sensitive information, costing the United States economy an estimated $200 billion every year. And the threats continue; during the week of April 22, a group threatened to launch a cyber-attack against the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), putting it and the websites of the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange and the Miami Stock Exchange, ""into a profound sleep.""  These types of unlawful, malicious behavior cannot be allowed to terrorize and economically cripple our nation. It is this type of activity  not individual American's internet usage habits or evidence of pirated movies or music  that the pending cybersecurity legislation would address.<p>H.R. 3523, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, which I co-sponsored, would expressly allow the government to provide private businesses with classified cyber-threat information.  It would also allow businesses to voluntarily share information about websites that contain malicious code, identify malware and harmful computer ""bots,"" and exchange data about cyber-attacks being conducted by thieves and those that would collapse our computer networks with each other and with the government.<p>Some have objected that H.R. 3523 invades Americans' privacy. The bill, however, has been carefully crafted to avoid that. Contrary to what you may have heard, H.R. 3523 does not authorize companies to share sensitive or private information or grant the government unfettered access to Americans' internet activities.   The bill does not authorize companies to transfer email exchanges, internet searching history, social networking activity, or other personally identifiable information (PII).  Instead, it authorizes companies and the government to voluntarily share cyber-threat signatures; known bad websites that will infect computers by launching malicious programming code that is designed to shut down computer networks; computer code for malware, etc.  Even then, information is to be made virtually anonymous before it is shared.  And, the government can only use the information it receives:
1)For cybersecurity  to protect computer networks from destruction, theft, etc.
2)For investigation and prosecution of cybercrimes  to prosecute those who seek to steal information or collapse vital computer networks;
3)For national security;
4)To prosecute and investigate acts that could cause bodily harm or death; and
5)To protect minors from child pornography.<p>H.R. 3523 does not allow the government to ""data mine"" the information to look for violations of any other laws or regulations. It does not allow the government to  use the information shared to look for or limit Americans' ownership or use of firearms or handguns.  H.R. 3523, therefore, has absolutely no impact on Americans' Second Amendment rights.<p>Furthermore, the government will be required to notify any private entity that inadvertently submits information that has not properly been anonymized or does not qualify as cyber-threat information. PII, therefore, will only be shared to identify the government or individuals who launch cyberattacks to steal information, collapse vital computer networks (such as those that run the NYSE or public utilities), threaten to cause bodily harm or death, or to create, exchange or participate in child pornography.<p>H.R. 3523 also requires the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community to review the government's use of information to ensure these restrictions are followed and to recommend future improvements and modifications to address privacy and civil liberties concerns. H.R. 3523, therefore, has several built-in privacy protections.   In addition, companies remain bound by state and federal privacy laws, and all privacy agreements between them and their customers.  H.R. 3523 does not affect or limit those protections and privacy rights in any way.<p>Furthermore, H.R. 3523 does not impose any additional burdens on American businesses.  It does not create any new government agencies, does not establish any new regulations, and does not require any company to report any information at all.  Instead, the bill creates an entirely voluntary system that will allow American computer networks to communicate with each other to protect against those who would steal from, attack, or economically harm us.<p>I am happy to report that H.R. 3523 enjoyed bipartisan support and broad support from several large industry leaders, such as Microsoft, AT&T, Symantec, Verizon, Business Software Alliance, TechAmerica, TechNet, and others. On April 26, H.R. 3523 passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 248-168, with my support.<p>On April 26, the House of Representatives also passed H.R. 4257, the Federal Information Security Amendments Act of 2012.  This bill would require federal agencies to automatically and continuously conduct threat assessments of their networks, to identify and mitigate risks of cyber attacks, thereby improving the security of our federal information.  This requirement would not be imposed on private industry.<p>H.R. 3523 and H.R. 4257 will now be transferred to the Senate for its consideration.<p>On a related note, some have expressed concern that the cybersecurity bills being considered by Congress would give government the ability to ""shut down the internet.""  In fact, the opposite is true. S. 413, the Cybersecurity and Internet Freedom Act of 2011, currently pending before the Senate, would declare that neither the President, the Director of the National Center for Cybersecurity and Communications, nor any officer or employee of the U.S. government shall have the authority to shut down the Internet.  This bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee has held hearings to collect information related to it.<p>Thank you for expressing your concern about cybersecurity. I am aware that a lot of misinformation spread very rapidly about these bills and I appreciate the opportunity to write to you to help clear things up. Rest assured, I take Americans' privacy rights and Second and Fourth Amendment rights very seriously.  I will continue to work with my colleagues to enact legislation that improves our national security while  at the same time  ensuring to protect your individual rights.<p>Once again, thank you for your correspondence.  I hope you will continue to contact me regarding issues of importance to you and your family. In the meantime, I encourage you to visit my website at www.calvert.house.gov and sign up for my weekly e-newsletters.

4012608,comment,4007229,4010368,1,0,tytso,,,"No, there's no need to consult the mailing list, except if you want to see the ""legislative history"" of the review process.<p>The person requesting the pull signs the pull request by signing the git tag.  The GPG signature on the git tag covers the complete history of up to that point in the tag, so there's no need to sign each and every git commit, as you propose.  When the upstream maintainer (or Linus, at the top level) accepts the pull request, git will automatically create a merge request that contains a copy of the git tag's GPG signature in the merge request.  (After this point, the git tag can be discarded).  When Linus releases something, he signs a git tag for the overall git repository, and everyone can check that.<p>So for example, when I am satisfied that everything in the ext4 tree that I want to push to Linus is OK, I create a signed tag named ""ext4_for_linus"", and send him a git pull request, which is created using the ""git request-pull"" command.  This creates an e-mail message contains the URL of my git repository and the name of the signed tag.  When Linus accepts my pull request, the resulting merge commit will contain a copy of my GPG signature from the git tag.  This signature signs my name to the commit id of the git tag, and the chain of SHA-1 hashes inherent in git guarantees that the entire commits back to the beginning of time came from me.  Of course, my changes will branch of something like v3.3-rc2, which is in Linus's tree, so what is being signed that is of interest is my new changes between v3.3-rc2 and the tip of the ext4 tree.<p>Once Linus has accepted my pull, I'll reuse the ext4_for_linus name for the next GPG-signed tag for the next  2-3 month development cycle, since the important bit (the GPG signature) is preserved for long-term posterity in the merge commit.  But what's important to note here is that the signature in the merge commit is signed by <i>me</i>, since it contains the contents of what I pushed to Linus, even though the merge commit was created by Linus when he accepted the pull request by merging in my changes into the repository.  What Linus signs is the GPG tag for the actual released kernel (i.e., v3.3).<p>See?  So there's no need to refer to the mailing list to validate the pull request or to establish after-the-fact accountability.  The mailing list is just used for review purposes.  But of course the review is a critical part of the acceptance process.",1337773817

Charlie Rose is a terrible interviewer, fawning all over people he thinks have high status, and constantly interrupting and pissing on people he disagrees with.

His show is worth watching because of the fantastic quality of the guests, not his skill as an interviewer. My favorite Charlie Rose moment was maybe 10 or 15 years ago, in an interview with I think Bill Joy, but it might have been someone else. Charlie asked some rambling minute-second dont you agree that... type question, and his guest responded with a bored look, well, duh.<p>Go listen to a couple of episodes of Terry Grosss truly masterful interviews on <i>Fresh Air</i>, or watch interviews by, say, Bill Moyers, and then come back and watch an episode of <i>Charlie Rose</i>. Try paying attention to the different ways they lead an interview, and the resulting differences in the conversation.

Everything else is necessary detail that describes the progression of the exploit from Pinkie Pie's point of view.<p>Your contributions, on the other hand, are much more content-free, being mostly value judgements against Chrome's PR or the supposed overconfidence of their programmers.

TuneBridge is a simple, easy and affordable audio streaming device. Using Apple's AirPlay, TuneBridge lets you stream your music or podcast from a wide variety of devices to just about any speaker or receiver out there. No need for special speakers or receivers, no more wires to contend with.<p>What I think is most exciting about the TuneBridge is the affordability. The target retail price is $59.99. This opens AirPlay up to just about anyone and any device.<p>This project is a huge leap for me to move out of a 9 to 5 engineering role and into the world of product startups. I'd love any feedback you guys may have.<p>Best,

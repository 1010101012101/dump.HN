He chose the name ""Node"" because it was supposed to be a small piece of a larger web app. A few nested callbacks, programs that have a few hundred lines of code and don't have complex control flows work well. Hype created a large community which is pushing beyond such narrow goals. But it will take time to come up with good DSLs or add continuations to V8. For now the best solution is to learn how to organize async code, for which I've only seen one trivial example.",1295143166

You just need empowered sub-units (with the lowest level as possible), and in general the smaller the sub-unit (all the way down to the individual... sometimes) will make your system more robust (and possibly more efficient). So in theory, you're lowest empowered sub-unit could just have a single manager/leader who still holds all the authority, while all the remaining team members are 'merely' well rehearsed and trained.<p>So in the case of the Chinese, you could just have empowered managers leading smallish work teams who are 'just' technically sound.

People have had 10 years to examine this open specification. I think its reasonable to say that one would have found a violation by now.  And almost all the majors are already either licensees or licensors.  There's a slim chance that there's a patent floating around in some patent troll portfolio that hasn't been examined, but that's the only real vector I can see of a legitimate surprise H264 patent violation.<p>Whereas with WebM its been in the public domain less than a year.

We're currently employed full-time (in DC), but are moving out to the SF bay area in the next month. We are starting a company, so likely won't have a ""full-time"" job, where our salaries are paid by someone else. That said, we both have a substantial savings we've attained from working for the past few years and would certainly be able to pay rent.<p>Both my girlfriend (Ainsley) and I went to MIT; she graduated in 2010 with two degrees in ""Brain and Cognitive Science"" and ""Writing"". I graduated in 2009 with a bachelor's in ""Computer Science and Engineering."" We're very laid back people, not prone to drama (and really try to avoid it as much as possible). Neither of us does any drugs, we'll occasionally drink (not to excess, just socially), and neither of us smoke. Well, I will have a cigar once every six months or so, but that's certainly something I can curb. :) Also, both she and I are 23 years old. We're both very clean people, and enjoy going out with friends, so you won't find us to be hermits. I basically can't survive without some sort of social interaction. Plus, we love animals.<p>Both of us are looking to move away from the government world and into making things for the world at large. Products people care about, that sort of thing.<p>A friend and I recently started a company we applied to YC with, got interviewed, and subsequently rejected from because we decided the company we applied with wasn't something we woke up in the middle of the night dreaming about. PG noticed that too. The basic response we got was ""come back with an idea you're in love with."" We're true hackers at heart, and I am always working on some product I hope people love. Now we're hoping to do it full-time and actually live or die by the products we produce. Ainsley and I have some pretty good ideas, and we want to get to building.<p>If we sound semi-interesting, we'd love to hear back. :) I hope the fact that we are two people doesn't make you consider us less; we really don't mind living in a single room together.

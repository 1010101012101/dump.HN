9491625,comment,9489204,9490047,0,0,soham,,,"At InterviewKickstart.com, we train candidates on various interviewing styles.<p>We believe, that a whiteboard is here to stay for some time, however much we hate it. Why?<p>1. Coding is perceived to be a commoditized skill, but engineering is not. Most companies worth their salt, hire engineers and not coders.<p>In today&#x27;s world of nearly everything available readily, coding is maybe 30% of an engineer&#x27;s job. Rest is designing, explaining and  thinking in a collaborative setting to arrive at the right solution/design/spec. There is no better tool for collaborative working than a whiteboard, and you want to see those skills in an interview.<p>2. It&#x27;s really easy to discuss a system-design question. Reading code samples and documents doesn&#x27;t give you a good idea of how a system is designed, as much/fast as talking to the person does. When talking about such high-level concepts, a block-diagram on a whiteboard is inevitable.<p>3. Coding doesn&#x27;t happen at speed of thought. Whiteboarding does. When you are trying to assess someone&#x27;s thought-process, you need a tool that caters to that speed.<p>4. Whiteboards are way more &quot;visible&quot; and life-size. They force you to stand up and hence pay attention.<p>5. A more subtle and controversial reason: White-boarding allows for approximation in a solution, which can be a good thing for an interviewer. Most interviewers are only concerned with high-level aspect of code and don&#x27;t want to take the time to read a solution in detail. Whiteboard provides that out.<p>6. When writing code in an assessment tool, it is not sufficient that the test-cases pass. You also have to pay attention to the time and space complexity. And when that complexity is not what you want, you feel like discussing it with the candidate, instead of just rejecting him/her. Whiteboarding allows the interviewer to pay attention to those things quickly.<p>7. Google does it! So everyone is going to keep following that :-)<p>Pair programming is a great alternative to whiteboarding. But still it doesn&#x27;t replace a whiteboard, which is just so fast, collaborative and convenient.",1430818451

There is also a good amount of research currently being done on automatic CAD model simplification for analysis (FEM/CFD) based on geometric simplification (various methods exist ranging from topology to fourier analysis [1]). Meshing theory also relies quite a bit on topology. [2] (but I don&#x27;t think anyone denies the importance of topology in CS though)<p>As for differential equations and calculus, they are heavily used in FEM [3] and CFD [4] and there is therefore a need to numerically evaluate these equations in a efficient manner. They are also heavily used in controls (for instance, in a quadcopter PID controller [5]). So I&#x27;m guessing in that case, differential equations are used to describe something you&#x27;re then modelling in your code through numerical integration. Numerical methods however rely both on understanding calculus and differential equations as a given numerical scheme may be more adapted to a particular type of DE than others [6][7][8][9] (sorry, couldn&#x27;t find a comparaison of these schemes on a single link so I&#x27;m citing a few).<p>Signals processing and statistical analysis may also be used in conjunction with differential equations such as in turbulence modeling in CFD. RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) equations essentially average the NS equations over time in order to locate areas of various turbulence strength [10]. LES (Large Eddy Simulation) filter small eddies out of the NS equations in order to be left with only the large eddies thus requiring less computational power [11] (the filtered eddies are modeled separately for the sake of energy balance).<p>Finally, I would argue that calculus is also used in optimization codes and neural networks with gradient based descents [12][13]<p>I hope I didn&#x27;t go off topic with this post, all I was trying to say is that in some fields of computer science, you do have to come up with algorithms evaluating differential equations using numerical methods, and an understanding of calculus and DE is a definitely plus. I&#x27;m sure finance has its share of DE to model requiring their understanding.<p>[1] <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=7D3225D31D097D26C0CDFC1A3AD251D1?doi=10.1.1.151.7854&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=7D3...</a>

The first is that startups are often, if not always, extremely bandwidth limited. It&#x27;s hard to spend time doing the training, allowing a person to experiment, and giving the freedom and mentorship that is needed to take a good engineer to a great one, or even a mediocre engineer into a good one, when you have only a limited amount of time and limited amount of funds to do so with. Molding engineers is a very long term investment, which suits companies like Google well, but doesn&#x27;t fit as well into much of the rest of SV.<p>The second is that even where you want to do such molding, you need the base set of great engineers to help with that.

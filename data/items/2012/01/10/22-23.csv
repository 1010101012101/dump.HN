3449518,comment,3448027,3448937,2,0,raganwald,,,"In the spirit of brainstorming, I think it’s cool to come up with some cases and ask, “what if?” In Yehuda’s article, he gives:<p><pre><code>  withFile: function(block) {\n    try {\n      var f = File.open(this.name, ""r"");\n      block(f);\n    } finally {\n      f.close();\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis is interesting: “block” appears to be a “callable” object. How does the code know whether it will be a block or a function? Can you assign the block parameter to a variable? Pass it to another function? What about:<p><pre><code>  function firstClass (block) { return block; }\n</code></pre>\nCan I do this? If so:<p><pre><code>  var thisIsaBlock = firstClass { |x| return x; }\n</code></pre>\nAnd we’re off the rails. Or worse:<p><pre><code>  (function () {\n\n    var local = ‘0xDEADBEEF';\n\n    return firstClass { || local }\n  })()()\n</code></pre>\nIf I am reading the code example correctly and my inference holds, then either (a) you have to do a lot of escape analysis to make this work, or (b) you get lazy and allow programmers to pass blocks around but emit an exception if you try to call a block once its lambda environment has already returned.<p>I guess I need to read the whole proposal...

The less skilled someone is at a particular language, the more bugs/vulnerabilities he is likely to produce. It is a function of technical skill rather than a quality of the language.<p>For example a Ruby interpreter or a Java runtime that you trust to handle all your HTTP requests are prominently written in C/C++.<p>I think what makes popular packages like Ruby/Java/Rails (etc.) more secure is the sheer number of users they have.

3449509,comment,3449077,3449359,4,0,NathanWong,,,"It's not clear that this comment is addressing any real issues.<p>Firstly, std::unordered_map is officially part of C++ now, and it's been available in all major compilers for a long time. Secondly, there's no substantial evidence provided to support the claim that the module system in a dynamic language is ""more flexible"" - anytime you want to include someone else's code in your source tree in any language you can just drop the source in as though it was your own. Whether there's a ""package manager"" to hide the references for you is beside the point; it's not as if the concept of shared libraries is lost upon C and C++.<p>And ""ahem"" does not establish a valid argument as to why dynamic type checking is ""easier"" (whatever that even means). In fact, I believe a strong argument could be made that dynamic type checking is the worst aspect of dynamic languages, and the interest that Haskell has been brewing up lately would tend to support this. Static type checking brings bugs to the forefront when the developer is in the room instead of the user. One could argue that runtime reflection provides more flexibility and thus makes dynamic languages ""easier"", but it's a stretch to extend that to dynamic typing.<p>I'm unsure of how DLL Hell would even apply to a SaaS application, unless we're referring to completely different things; you have complete control of your application's environment in a web app. If there's a package already installed that you don't want or something is missing, you remove it or install it. With the prevalence of virtualization and virtualization-as-a-service, there's no reason to be trying to run two different applications that require different dependencies on the same virtual box.",1326235927

3449469,comment,3449077,3449077,11,0,alttag,,,"Heh.<p>I used to work for a company that used C (not C++) for its large web site. They ran the entire site from a monolithic C file. To say again, the code for the entire web site (including product listings, shopping cart, coupons, etc.) was in <i>one</i> .c file.  To make things more ""interesting,"" it was, at the time controlled by a single developer who didn't work on site and wouldn't let anyone else touch his code. This barrier was backed up, as I understood, by both tradition and management.<p>The initial decision for C was, I think, the correct one. The site had been around from the early days of the web, and speed was important. However, the architecting and personnel decisions didn't keep up with the company's growth. Another consequence, though, was switching to CSS (which came along later) from, for example, spacer gifs, took a great deal of developer time and testing, as did adding new features. It's  the trade-off I think we all understand well today: fast code or fast developers.<p>It was interesting to see the changes while I was there—the site began (slowly) to get recoded in Java, and broken into more manageable chunks at the same time. So far as I know, the whole thing is now in Java.",1326235340

If your collaborators have other ideas, bribe them with tasty cookies or something, because this right here solves a lot of hassles. There are some circumstances in which a different encoding might have its advantages, but it is tremendously reassuring to be able to say ""Ah, text! I shall decode it as UTF-8!"" and be right. This has the advantage of being compatible with ASCII input, and avoiding the perennial UTF16/UCS2 confusion.<p>* Make it explicit that you're using UTF-8. For example, if you're making a web page, be sure to set ""Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8"" in the HTTP headers, to make the browser's content encoding detection trivially correct.<p>* When dealing with strings in your favorite programming language, always know whether it's an array of Unicode code-points, or of bytes in UTF-8, or some third messed-up thing. Not all strings are the same kind of thing! Unless your programming language has this distinction enforced by its type system, of course.<p>* Be aware when you're crossing the boundary between Unicode code points and Unicode in some external encoding. Decoding can fail, so be prepared. It's best to reject invalid text as early as possible.<p>* When in doubt, use other people's code for Unicode handling. For most of the crazy crap you run into in the wild, there is well-tested crazy-crap-handling code.",1326234782

3449331,comment,3447559,3447559,1,0,billpatrianakos,,,"The main point is right but the post glosses over some critical details.<p>Switching from Mac to Linux is pretty easy. Switching from Windows is trickier. The languages are the same but setting up your environment is a chore. Most instructions for setting up local development environments are focused on Unix like systems. If you learned on Windows and switch to Linux or Mac things can be strange for you but luckly there's no shortage of easy setup instructions and terminal one-liners to get you started. If you learned on Mac or Linux and switch to Windows then you'll have a harder time as you always have to make sure you're looking for the Windows instructions or tools.<p>Want to set up an AMP stack (on your system not using Xampp) on Windows? You're jumping through hoops if you came from any other OS. Want to use multiple Ruby versions? RVM and RBENV don't run on Windows. Experienced programmers can make these switches easily with only some minor annoyances but someone in the first few years of their programming journey will have a much harder time. The way Windows does things isn't necessarily wrong and it's no one's fault that it doesn't have any sort of Unix heritage like every other popular OS these days. But the case can be made that switching to or from Windows can matter depending on the programmer while a Mac to any Linux distro switch has a negligible effect on workflow and productivity.<p>This isn't about Windows being sucky. It isn't. It's just different enough to warrant a disclaimer, that disclaimer being ""while it doesn't matter what platform you develop on for the most part, Windows does things differently enough that switching to or from it can matter if you're somewhat green"". These days documentation for most popular tools assume a Unix-like development environment. Windows users need to Google for instructions.<p>It's also worth noting, like one of the commenters on the original page said, that most Linux GUI tools aren't as good as they are on Mac and Windows so of you're not totally comfortable in the terminal youd better get there or use another OS. There's no shame in preferring a GUI tool and it isn't necessarily the mark of a noob or bad programmer. I'm an alright programmer myself, very comfortable in the terminal, know vi and nano well but prefer a GUI text editor. It's not bad, just different.<p>So I guess what I'm saying is that the article's point stands but it's a bit of an oversimplification.",1326233552

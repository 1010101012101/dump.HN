9737466,comment,9737230,9737230,0,0,matthewmacleod,,,"It&#x27;s frustrating to see this somewhat blinkered view.<p>Yeah, Apple definitely doesn&#x27;t like copyleft. That&#x27;s okay; lots of people don&#x27;t (especially larger companies – how many large companies actively release GPLd software?). It&#x27;s a legitimate business decision, and there are some good arguments that support it (which you may or may not agree with).<p>The idea that organisations &#x27;owe&#x27; the community copyleft software is therefore a bit foreign to me.<p>Furthermore:<p><i>We&#x27;ll likely see pieces of Swift 2.0 thrown over the wall. But the best stuff will be kept proprietary.</i><p>That&#x27;s a bit of a weird assumption. Apple&#x27;s statement was the the Swift code and standard library would be open-sourced. What is the &#x27;best stuff&#x27; that we&#x27;re not going to get?<p><i>Apple&#x27;s not-yet-executed move to liberate some of the Swift 2.0 code seems a tactical stunt to win over developers who currently prefer the relatively more open nature of the Android/Linux platform … the copyleft license of Linux itself provides the opportunity to keep the core operating system of Android liberated.</i><p>That&#x27;s a bit flaccid. Google and the Android platform has equally went out of the way to isolate the platform from the effects of the GPL. In fact, I&#x27;m pretty sure one of the reasons Bionic (the Android libc) exists is specifically to limit the impact of GPL code on the platform. Android&#x27;s use of Linux is basically a historical accident, and painting it as some kind of concerted effort towards software freedom isn&#x27;t a compelling point.<p>TL;DR - you need to relax. Apple releasing open-source code is a good thing. We can now all benefit from using this code. Maybe you&#x27;d prefer if it were copylefted, but it&#x27;s not – it&#x27;s still good, and painting it as an evil move against software freedom seems like a bit of a mental stretch.",1434617910

9737421,comment,9733168,9734079,0,0,erikpukinskis,,,"It&#x27;s funny to me, I used to merely tolerate JavaScript... I came from Ruby (and PHP/Java/C# before that) where you could create these super complex control flow structures and JavaScript felt so verbose and unwieldy and limited.<p>I mean, no inheritance? No method_missing? How do you write humane, readable DSLs with just functions and prototypes?<p>I&#x27;ve explored all kinds of tricks since then: OO libraries, promises, fibers, CoffeeScript classes and all its other sugar.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is I&#x27;ve swung fully back in the other direction. I find myself increasingly drawn to very simple, very JavaScripty JavaScript. Functions. Variables. Constructors. Prototypes. Closures. Arrays. Objects. I think almost all of the new JavaScript features are more trouble than they&#x27;re worth.<p>Take promises for example. Here&#x27;s some junky callbacky JavaScript:<p><pre><code>    libraryStuff(function() {
      moreLibraryStuff(function() {
        thirdLibraryStuff(function() {
          console.log(&quot;done!&quot;)
        })
      })
    })
</code></pre>
Gross. Nesting. With promises you can do this lovely bit of magic:<p><pre><code>    libraryStuff()
    .then(moreLibraryStuff)
    .then(thirdLibraryStuff)
    .then(function() {
      console.log(&quot;done!&quot;)
    })
</code></pre>
Which certainly fixed the nesting problem. But you made your stack almost incomprehensible, and you made your execution thread harder to trace. And now the runtime is popping back and forth between your code and the promise library every step. But the scariest thing of all is you created a bunch of these promise objects that you could, like, return, and some totally unrelated code could interact with it and totally fudge up the control here. You took something that had really well bounded semantics and turned it into something that is wide open to be messed with in bizarre ways.<p>That&#x27;s what power is. That&#x27;s why people love promises, you have power to do all manner of outlandish control flow. Except I really don&#x27;t want to have to debug your bizarre circus of promises.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am certainly capable of debugging your circus of promises. I just really would prefer not to.<p>And anyway there&#x27;s a way easier solution. Because JavaScript uses function scope, you can just do this:<p><pre><code>    libraryStuff(yourResponse)

    function yourResponse() {
      moreLibraryStuff(yourNextResponse)
    }

    function yourNextResponse() {
      thirdLibraryStuff(finish)
    }

    function finish() {
      console.log(&quot;done!&quot;)
    }
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s easily traceable. You get a real call stack no matter where you crash in that flow. And yeah, I doubled the number of symbols here, but that just means I was forced to <i>actually label my application code</i>. Which might not be such a bad idea anyway. In my production code all of these functions are going to be several lines anyway, and it&#x27;s quite nice to be reminded that I should give them a good label.<p>Of course if this was CoffeeScript, your stacktrace wouldn&#x27;t have function names because CoffeeScript threw away that feature in exchange for being able to type &quot;->&quot; instead of &quot;function&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed this pattern over and over: someone gets frustrated because JavaScript doesn&#x27;t give you insane tools to quickly spin up bafflingly complex flow structures. They find this frustrating, because they&#x27;re used to baffling flow structures from all of the crappy code they&#x27;ve been forced to get comfortable with, so they write some insane library that lets you do crazy stuff in JavaScript.<p>The same thing happened to me in Ruby. I was so entranced by the power and magic of DSLs that I was constantly looking for excuses to return chainable objects from functions and all of this stuff. I would build things like that in production code, and feel proud of myself that I made this super powerful thing with a complicated implementation and a simple, prose-like interface.<p>But almost every time, after living with the interface for a while, I would realize that I could&#x27;ve solved the problem with just functions, literals, and arrays, and structs if I had actually taken the time to figure out the right abstractions.<p>Less and less do I think I need some fancy new kind of function. More and more I think I need to be more thoughtful about what the function actually does.",1434616885

At the same time, I find the religious pushes for and against to be both understandable and bizarre. I&#x27;ve been thinking about this for some time now, but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever really written it down.<p>As a very general statement, I&#x27;d say any developer should try their hardest covers the basic tenets of TDD while working. Let me back that up, since I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s probably rubbed people up the wrong way.<p>1. I know what the system is currently doing<p>2. I know what the system <i>should</i> be doing<p>3. These things are different, and I know how to check<p>4. I change the system<p>5. I check that the system is now doing what it should be doing<p>That all seems pretty uncontroversial, I hope.<p>1. If you don&#x27;t know what the system is doing now, you can&#x27;t tell if there&#x27;s anything to do at all.<p>2. If you don&#x27;t know what it should be doing, there&#x27;s no way of implementing it.<p>3. If you can&#x27;t check that if it&#x27;s doing the right thing (even manually) then you&#x27;re fairly screwed (although we&#x27;ve all ended up in a case where the &quot;check&quot; is &quot;ask the customer afterwards if it&#x27;s fixed&quot;).<p>4. You obviously need to actually do something to change the system.<p>5. Finally you should check your work actually, well, works.<p>The idea that you have an automated check for 3 seems like a fairly good idea, as long as it&#x27;s not too onerous. Then suggesting that it&#x27;s implemented and run before 4 makes sense, it&#x27;s unlikely to be much harder to do it before rather than afterwards and it gives me some confidence that the test checks what I think it does.<p>Personally, while I quite like the workflow presented, I&#x27;d do most of that on paper / whiteboard / in my head. Take the task and break it down into smaller things it needs to do. Don&#x27;t rush into creating the right structure, just actually understand what it is this thing will need to do. Then I can consider general designs, where the edges will be, types of failures and errors that are likely to pop up and I can write something (as always, discovering more as it&#x27;s written and having to change things). It&#x27;s very useful to then start on the bits I&#x27;m less sure about, or the ones that will have the most impact if I have to change things.

However my current preferred approach (for anything non-trivial) is different to the authors. As he does I start out with outer-level acceptance-y tests, however those integration tests are then combined with extensive refactoring to drive the design, so I don&#x27;t do the dreaming up of collaborators he does in step 4.<p>My reason for not thinking of collaborators early is although I think that approach has legs I found it didn&#x27;t necessarily always the simplest/most elegant design you could come up with. I ended up encoding my first understanding of how to solve the problem into the interactions, even though I knew that my understanding of the problem at that point was much less than it would be once I dug a bit deeper.<p>Anyway with my current approach if I extract additional classes/whatever I might then test them directly, or use further tests to drive their design further (incl test doubles as appropriate).

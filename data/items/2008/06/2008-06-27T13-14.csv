229740,comment,229668,229697,0,0,seregine,,,"That is the most common reason for using a cache in the first place, so you seem to be stating the obvious. Am I missing something?<p>If I remember right, skip lists are unfriendly to caches (compared to balanced search trees) because they don't optimize locality of reference. This matters, for example, when your huge dataset is on disk and you're trying to cache the working set in memory. In a skip list, related elements don't end up on the same page as often, which means you have to read more data than you need from disk, and read from the disk more often.",1214575115

If you just have the text ""interslice"", the reader needs additional prompting to know it is a website.<p>Likewise, if you see someone's e-mail address listed as ""bob@us.interslice.c"", you can tell just by looking at it that there's probably something wrong with it -- maybe you can even diagnose and fix the problem yourself.  But you can't do this for arbitrary strings, which carry no such redundancy.",1214575057

It's worth noting that the anti-monopoly laws are retrospective, which means you can be found guilty of things <i>that were not illegal at the time you did them</i>.<p>If the democratic will of the People is that the government regulates business that's one thing, but retrospective laws are just insidious.

The fact that most people expend this power on making more money is a correlation not a cause.<p>Equally converting power into money is trivial, with just a few megawatts available and some crocodile clips you can get almost any banker to agree to hand over his cash ;)",1214574630

And, if they are, what stops squatters from snatching them up as they have done with the current set of domains?<p>As far as I can see, any change in the availability of ""good names"" is temporary.  The long-term effects of new TLDs are (1) more money for ICANN, (2) more confusion on the part of the users as to whether a given piece of text is a domain name, and (3) more phishing sites.",1214574141

I coughed up the (not insignificant) cash in order to get a gym and make sure to work out every morning as a start to my day. Do at least 30 minutes of cardio at a good clip (most machines give you numbers, so try to burn 400 calories at least). Lift some weights too, because it increases muscle mass, which will increase your metabolism.<p>If you're really into something prescriptive, I highly recommend this book: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Core-Performance-Revolutionary-Workout-Transform/dp/157954908X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Core-Performance-Revolutionary-Workout...</a><p>I know the cover looks cheesy, but it's actually really well written and very detailed (it tells you on a daily basis what to do). Workouts are an hour long, six days a week, and they incorporate flexibility and injury prevention exercises, which are quite important.<p>For diet, here in NYC I stop by Whole Foods or something similar right after the gym and make my own salad. Almost always, it's purely vegetarian. Make sure you get a lot of greens in there, and as many other colors of vegetables as you can.<p>Dinner is a highly social meal, and I end up messing it up often.<p>I do miss all of Seattle's outdoors though ...",1214573870

Sadly, this is a fairly common situation for people trying to rise above what's typical and do something great.

It is less customizable in terms of changing the code, but it definitely encourages purchases, which Amazon has down pretty good, and you can also probably get a few products that you might not want to stock, and sell them on commission. You can always build the social part over the store, with people only going there to purchase something.",1214572935

I couldn't find the full text online (at least not for free), but the abstract is here:<p><a href=""http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA370117"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPr...</a><p>Quote: ""For men, the Navy equation was the best predictor of body fat determined by hydrostatic weighing.""<p>So all you need to track your body fat is a measuring tape plus a pen and a pad.

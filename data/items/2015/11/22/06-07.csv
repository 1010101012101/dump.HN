For example, I take Lunesta for sleep.  My insurance tried to force me to switch to its generic counterpart, eszopiclone, by raising the copay on the name brand from $10 to $230.  I have never suffered from depression in my life, until I took this medication for just three days and wound up in a debilitating state of depression.  I immediately stopped taking it, and the depression went away within a day.

Even though we apparently are on completely opposite sides of the spectrum here I&#x27;m going to go into this with an open mind and assume at the end of this short conversation I&#x27;m going to come out the other end learning something new.  I&#x27;ll lay out what I&#x27;m thinking here, and please explain to me where I&#x27;ve misunderstood and please clarify so we can get to the root of what you&#x27;re talking about.<p>First, I can&#x27;t see how this is a strawman.  Logically, in academia, perhaps you could argue this is a strawman because you technically didn&#x27;t say the word &quot;prevent&quot;, but in the &quot;real world&quot; I can&#x27;t see how 50% of the entire world&#x27;s population (or whatever percentage we&#x27;re talking about here) would just agree with your hypothesis and say: &quot;You know what, he&#x27;s probably right.  We, the poor people of the world are a burden on society and shouldn&#x27;t be having children of our own.  From this day forward we vow not to have children because we think this guy may be right, that it would truly end human suffering when it&#x27;s all said and done&quot;.  No.  The only way this experiment would proceed is through a large-scale state-sponsored effort to prevent poor people from having children.  Against their will.  And not only this, but I&#x27;m almost positive that if this large-scale effort proceeded it would more than likely erupt into a civil (world?) war.  Far from the original goal to &quot;eliminate human suffering&quot;.<p>Second, I can&#x27;t see how this is a personal attack.  That is unless you do believe a person&#x27;s self worth is measured by the size of their bank account.  And if you do believe a person&#x27;s self-worth is measured by the size of their bank account, it&#x27;s no more a personal attack than the attack you&#x27;ve made on poor people by insinuating that they are the root cause of human suffering on this planet, simply because they have the audacity to have children of their own.",1448174743

10609300,comment,10606482,10606482,0,0,kevindeasis,,,"I am hesitant to spend time learning on react because of this:<p>&quot;\nSomeCallMeTim:\nI have been learning new technologies pretty much continuously. It&#x27;s not impossible, especially if you follow sites like Hacker News, to keep a finger on the direction of the industry, and then try to stay on top of the next new hot technology of the year.\nBut I hear you on the &quot;worse&quot; technology sometimes winning. You mentioned Java; it was worse than just about all other major contenders, and is only finally losing popularity.\nOn a current technology fad: React seems to be designed to ignore 40 years of accumulated software best practices. [1] Separation of concerns? Who needs that any more? And the rationale for it is that it allows teams of 100 developers work together on an app. Open standards? Nah, how about lock-in to custom language extensions that will prevent you from migrating your code to the next web standard! Much better.\nAnd how many app teams have 100 or more active developers? Probably fewer than a dozen, and I submit that none of them probably should. Certainly not the Facebook app: It has a lot of features, but not that many features, and yet it has a 150Mb footprint. When I hear things like that, I can&#x27;t help but fill in &quot;junior&quot; or &quot;mediocre&quot; in front of &quot;developers.&quot; React helps to prevent people from breaking each others&#x27; code when you have bloated development teams filled with junior developers. React has some cool ideas, but all told I think it&#x27;s a step backward for software engineering, and certainly isn&#x27;t as much of a help for small teams, especially if you want to have a CSS/SCSS/LESS expert styling your product without having to dig through JSX files, for instance.\nThe Java rationale was similar, IMO: You can use the Java abstractions to allow lots of mediocre developers to make contributions to a product without breaking each others&#x27; code. At least not as frequently as when they can poke right into random data structures and change things arbitrarily. If it weren&#x27;t for Google&#x27;s decision to require Java for Android, I think Java would be relegated to big company web backend development.\nI do like React&#x27;s idea of the Virtual DOM for optimization, but you can get that without using React. [2] React Native is great for using native components and driving them from JavaScript, but it&#x27;s also not the only game in town. [3]\nBack to the original point, though: You can stay on top of the Hot New Technologies, but when there are good technical reasons to use alternate technologies, stay on top of those as well. And then explain clearly to your clients (or employers) why the current fad is a fad, and how to get the key benefits of that stack without its drawbacks. Oh, and choose clients (or employers) who will listen to strong technical arguments. :)\n[1] <a href=""https://www.pandastrike.com/posts/20150311-react-bad-idea"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pandastrike.com/posts/20150311-react-bad-idea</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://www.nativescript.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nativescript.org/</a>\n&quot;",1448174419

Basically it has a phoney and sorta contrived tone to it. This might be a bigger deal than usual because your audience is fashion conscious and these sorts of subtle indicators of inauthenticity and fake enthusiasm will turn them off. Along those lines, your blog says &quot;The fashion season is back&quot; and that just doesn&#x27;t make sense and spoils your credibility.

I&#x27;m wondering if your lack of expertise in the fashion world is showing through and turning away people with a trained eye for style. I think as far as that goes, your best bet would be to market your app more authentically. Go with a silicon valley/genius/geeks (don&#x27;t use the word geek though) sorta approach. Fit the narrative of other connecting apps they know like Uber (innovative) or tumblr (quirky/self-aware).

It&#x27;s one significant disadvantage to buying things online now: you get way more choice, but it&#x27;s often difficult to be really sure what something will be like, going only from 2D pictures and a text description.  And in some cases - clothing in particular - even if you have exact specs and great images of the item itself, it isn&#x27;t terribly useful without context.  (Cars would fit in that category too.)  With VR though (and help from 3d cameras and body mapping), shopping for clothes online could be a better experience than in person.  You could virtually try on 10 shirts faster than you could get into a fitting room in the real world, and see them from arbitrary angles as well.  Or take furniture.  Rather than looking at pictures, how about seeing exactly how that side table will look <i>in your living room</i>?  The possibilities are endless.<p>Admittedly until we get true &quot;virtual reality&quot; you won&#x27;t be able to tell how a pair of pants or a couch or whatever actually feels, nor will you really be able to virtually test drive a car (which as the article suggests is a pretty significant part of the buying process) but it will still be a completely different world from e-commerce today, and in many ways better than shopping in brick and mortar stores, even aside from the convenience of not leaving your home and the infinite selection of the internet.",1448172825

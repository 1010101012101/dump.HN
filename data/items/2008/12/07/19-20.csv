Give your primary girlfriend your primary cell, give the secondary/tertiary/etc'iary girlfriends the secondary number<p>3) I used to know a lot more, because in high school I really wanted to date 3 or 4 girls at a time (and I could, but friends talked me out of it).

Being single doesn't ensure loneliness, and being married doesn't imply the lack thereof.<p>There are plenty of hedonic studies that show that married people are neither happier nor less happy, as a group, than singles, and that people with children are actually <i>less</i> happy when the children are young (which makes sense; young kids are annoying). This is often taken to indicate that romantic relationships have no bearing on personal happiness. That's wrong, actually. The average is flat, but individual people shift around (up, or down) a great deal.<p>""Expectancy"" in getting married, however, is about zero. If you settle out of some desire to be married for its own sake, it's probably negative.",1228677952

He works on porting a number of libraries - so he's definitely putting in some hard work - but has had issues with project owners not updating CHANGELOGs properly, deliberately breaking Windows support, etc.<p>At Euruko (European Ruby conference) earlier this year, I raised the topic of Windows and.. most of the audience couldn't care less. They were mostly of the opinion that if Windows people wanted to use Ruby, they had to do the legwork. (FWIW, I'm an OS X user who doesn't care too much for Windows either, but I recognize there's a massive userbase there)<p>Windows is in the third-world of operating systems when it comes to Ruby - so Jamis' standpoint is less than surprising.",1228676632

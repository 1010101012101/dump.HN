It&#x27;s a practical urban survival guide overall.  It&#x27;s a pdf that&#x27;s widely available.)<p>If you want a simple business model that works, sell t-shirts on a high pedestrian traffic area or tourist trap area (pier 39 sf).  You may even clean people&#x27;s car windows for tips and pay at gas stations if you ask the owner|manager & explain (many gas stations are independently owned.. Expect to have to visit 10-15 stations to get approval and be super sincere).  It&#x27;s generic hard work, but it&#x27;s doable without skill or funding.  Also sign up for TaskRabbit for more skilled jobs that could pay more.  (See a pattern.. Try lots of things and hustle to get to higher paying gigs.).  Btw playing up youth leads to money... Stay clean, shave, youthful attire and get a haircut if needed... You&#x27;re the product if you offer a service.  (Either look professional or super pathetic, in between leads to less cash.)<p>Some religious organizations will help you, others like most of those in Silicon Valley, only do happy-clappy and no social service volunteering as do others in poorer areas.  In fact if you ever had to bet outright, don&#x27;t bother begging from rich people, beg from lower/middle class areas.<p>If it&#x27;s a super emergency in the US, apply for food stamps and general assistance at your local social services agency.  They&#x27;ll usually give it to you <i>the same day</i> in the form of an EBT card that works at Costco, grocery stores and pharmacies.  It&#x27;s a pittance, but it will keep you alive if you budget it very carefully. (Beware: massive fees at almost every ATM.  Always get cash back at stores instead.)  They may even throw in medical insurance if you&#x27;re broke enough.  (I was a teacher in a minority area and had to help emancipated students get food and get to school...  I&#x27;ve seen almost everything. :( ). Rationalize going on the dole as a buffer that you will pay back through taxes many times over later, or to wealth and minimal taxes and let the middle class handle that.<p>Cut your expenses (don&#x27;t eat out) and travel as least as possible.  Maybe buy a cheapish van and live in it instead of paying rent.  Cancel all those monthly Internet services (games, Netflix, Hulu, spotify), perhaps even phone service.  Use coffee shops for power and data, maybe go Skype / google voice only.  Cut luxury prepared foods too.   Shelter, food and transportation (gas) are the actual necessities... Everthing else is a choice to rationalize excessive consumerism.  (Stop smoking, drinking and latte habits if present... This is where most poor people hemorrhage money and may harm their health too.  For blanks sake don&#x27;t drink or do drugs but do get good sleep, your judgement (wits) needs to be perfect or one mistake on the street will kill you... You need to be making the best possible decisions as often as possible to bootstrap yourself back to where you want to be.)<p>Don&#x27;t count on a startup for income... It&#x27;s always a long shot / crapshoot and most stories are pure survivor bias hiding the work, pain and luck involved.",1419742764

We&#x27;re going to need far fewer people than on a Java project, and you won&#x27;t need the layers of management that come with big teams, and you&#x27;ll also have smaller code and more of an ability to use the Unix philosophy (systems compromised to multiple, usually small, programs).

Given your educational background, this is probably the biggest hurdle you have to overcome.<p>2. Inadequate assessment of abilities. Unfortunately many younger developers think they&#x27;re a lot better than they are so they try to tackle super-challenging projects. If you&#x27;re young and inexperienced, start with the easy stuff (ie. basic CRUD apps for boring businesses).

You&#x27;re going to see all of the downsides but only 1% of the upside of being a founder.<p>Let&#x27;s expand on this, because that&#x27;s me and I&#x27;m quite happy (but also willing to be convinced otherwise :D).<p>Financially, you&#x27;re balancing lower salary with a potential for a large upside later.  That upside can be great if you believe in the company and/or the value of the stock options offsets the lower salary, which it probably has the last two times I&#x27;ve done it, and definitely didn&#x27;t the first 3.  That being said, the first three gave me access to the last 2, and allowed me to see why the last 2 would work in a way that the first 3 didn&#x27;t.  Edit: also, comparing to the risk an entrepreneur takes, the salary cut tends to be much higher for an entrepreneur than an early hire (often the entrepreneur takes little to no salary for a long time).<p>In some ways you miss out on working with specific talent.  You work with fewer people, so by definition you have access to fewer viewpoints.  That&#x27;s a very real opportunity loss, for sure.  On the other hand, you get to work on a wider variety of things, and working at an early company tends to give you a better work-life balance which can allow you to learn more aggressively outside of work (and allow me to be a happier person in general).  You also get far more control over the company&#x27;s direction, if you care about stuff like that.<p>In terms of &quot;might as well be a founder&quot; - my CEO puts in way more work, way more hours than I do, is able to attract better talent than I can, is able to attract money in a way I couldn&#x27;t, is able to administer the business better than I can etc.  If I didn&#x27;t think that was true, I wouldn&#x27;t be where I am (this is part of the skillset that I can pick up at an early stage company that I couldn&#x27;t at a later stage company).  If I had those skills, yes it would obviously be better for me to found, but I don&#x27;t so I don&#x27;t think the way you&#x27;ve laid out the risk is entirely fair.<p>There are many more trade offs, but it&#x27;s difficult for me to see why being an early stage employee is worse than a late stage.

I don&#x27;t really fault you for arguing your corner. But you should be aware that it&#x27;s not necessarily in the interest of your fellow Americans, never mind VCs. Other Americans also benefit from the application of software to all sorts of problems. Increased salaries for engineers mean that software is more expensive (however it&#x27;s paid for), and there&#x27;s less of it.<p>PS: the parasites feeding on nexus of finance are a separate issue. It doesn&#x27;t make your argument more convincing, because they are a special case, recently in particular. Those parasites need dealing with, but the regulatory system has largely been captured, especially in the US. My problem with working in finance is ethics, rather than salary. Much of those earnings have been against latent risks that the taxpayer is underpinning.",1419740767

Unless companies like Google relocate ( to where? ) then yes, wages would absolutely rise, because <i>they don&#x27;t allow WFH</i> [1], ergo <i>the only engineers available</i> would be those in the Bay Area, NYC, etc. No, they wouldn&#x27;t outsource critical infrastructure to places like India or China, who hacked them. I also don&#x27;t see them picking up and leaving and going to e.g. Vancouver.<p>I think the only way to address this &quot;great engineer&quot; thing without American engineers crying foul is to <i>gasp</i> introduce standardized testing that all the American tech companies -- who can&#x27;t get the amazing talent -- agree upon and then select the 99th percentile of the candidates that pass it and pay them in the 99th percentile of wages for the bay area. This would be an objective measure and Americans wouldn&#x27;t be suspicious of whatever criteria VCs/founders use to measure &quot;great programming ability&quot;. Make the interviews and the criteria public, bring it to the light, then people would be more inclined to believe them. Right now I simply hear a bunch of hand-wavey math and see a bunch of rich people whining about how they don&#x27;t have engineers to build <i>their things</i>. Yes, I know there are flaws with standardized tests, but it&#x27;s the best of bad things.<p>[1] Most companies.

You&#x27;re equating new bottles of soda (which are like copies of a book) with new works (which would be more like new flavors of cola). I would imagine, incidentally, that Harry Potter will continue to spawn new work, in the same way that Star Wars has spawned a variety of new fictional works in the form of animated series, videogames, book tie-ins and so on which are all ancillary to the &#x27;original&#x27; 6 films (soon to be 7 and later 8 and 9). As well as that there are all the other non-fictional ancillaries, like books about Star Wars, from the production of the film to catalogs of all the different spaceships and robots etc. etc.<p>I&#x27;m not at all sure that copyright should extend beyond the life of the author but I think you should acknowledge that while all the stuff above serves a marketing function it also provides utility to hardcore fans of the original works.<p><i>Actual work which nobody but the heirs will see the benefits of, assuming what I have assumed.</i><p>Viewers and consumers get a benefit from the careful transfer of original works to new media and the production of new ancillary media.

Although it makes up a tiny  part of the consumer cost, format transfers generally require a huge amount of work by skilled professionals, the cost of which can run into the millions. On a film like <i>Star Wars</i> it&#x27;s a vanishingly small amount of the revenue a new release format can generate, but indirectly that subsidizes (through technological debt) the cost to do similar work for much less popular films, eg the very high quality reissues of substantially less popular films via brands like the Criterion Collection, which maintains very high technical standards for art films with a relatively small audience.",1419739218

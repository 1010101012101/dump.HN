If your application flatly doesn't do the right thing, than a big rewrite from scratch may really be the best choice - there's nothing to save.<p>But spaghetti code doesn't just fall from the sky, it occurs because of politics, stubbornness, and bad processes.  Over the course of the 10+ years it took to make the code base, is it really the case that nobody but you noticed the problem?  It's more likely that there's a lot of pressure going in the opposite direction, and other maintainers didn't know what to do either.<p>Dealing with subsystems helps you handle both problems.  Management might not be willing to let you rewrite the whole thing, but if you said, ""Let's just fix the boot-up process for the Cyclotron 4000 resource.  Nothing else changes, just the Cyclotron boot."" you might be able to get permission.  In a badly-maintained project, it's hard to replace all the instances of one service - that's what makes it 'badly-maintained' - but it's still easier than dealing with the whole system in one go.  And, of course, instead of 'fixing' the Cyclotron you're actually rewriting it with a new, non-wacko Cyclotron service.<p>Then you go back to your manager and say, ""It was rough, but the Cyclotron 4000 no longer blocks the start-up.  Let's get the next thing on the list.""  Not only do you have a slightly better project, you also have better credibility with management, which makes it more likely you'll be listened to when you say a certain technical measure is necessary.  Next, fix the subsystem that talks to the Cyclotron - and so on.  Pick a right time to introduce tests, code review, and all the rest.<p>Remember that just as you had the experience working with the terrible code base, your managers had the experience of working with the previous 3 or 4 software architects who ""had their own vision"" and delivered a product that doesn't start up reliably - I don't think it's surprising that there was no longer the political will to assign people to refactoring or rewriting tasks.  Bad architecture uses up the political will needed to approve good architecture, because it makes all ""architecture"" tasks look bad.  You need to regard you reputation as a finite, under-supplied resource just as much as your time and budget and plan to get more.<p>From your use of the past tense, it looks like you're no longer in that situation (good for you!)... but that would be my advice if you see a similar situation in the future.  I've used this plan in my own career to rewrite a (much smaller, only moderately troubled) project piece by piece over the course of a year.",1330015338

In order to do the research my team signed various agreements related to data and any publication is dependent on approval from the data sources. Science is about free publication but we don't own the data so we have to play by their rules to access it. The primary reason in our case was an earlier publication of preliminary data that had been sent to media and caused a big stir with damning headlines. Unfortunately the legitimately scientific practice of publishing whatever you have and letting the scientific community build on it becomes quite problematic when the media broadcasts interim results as findings (and then land values plummet, or political pressure halts a multimillion dollar project). So there might be a legitimate reason for the legal threats (Though the article implies otherwise)<p>On the other hand, pinning down environmental causes of cancer is shockingly difficult and even partial results are very useful for the research because we simply can't put a test subject in a box and pump it full of a chemical to see if they get cancer. Most known carcinogens (by the IARC definition) are known through studies on workplace exposure.<p>It would be a serious blow if the study had concrete evidence but the legal threats managed to delay publication until after IARC finishes its review.",1330015240

I had much more fun with CD-ROMs from computer magazines.<p>The other essential turning point was the discovery that the phone company would only charge you a single pulse from midnight to 6 am. So at 12:01, the horde of nerds would dispute the few available lines of the ISPs to try to get connected. No taximeter, no Moms inadvertently grabbing the phone and disconnecting you. That kind of shaped a whole generation's habits and schedules.<p>At about the same time there was also a change of culture. I remember having to call people to tell them I sent an email a few days ago. When people began answering me the same day, things started to get interesting. And then there was SPAM and we lost that forever :)<p>Or least until Gmail came along and rescued us with its magical bayesian filter and petabytes of data.",1330014983

Does it involve a draft and killing large numbers of people somewhere? Nope. We have a war on poverty, a war on drugs, a war on obesity, and so on. How about ""rights"" what's a right? Is it some piece of property that the government is forbidden to take from you? Nope. We have an airline passenger's bill of rights, a right to contraceptives, now a privacy bill of rights, and so on.<p>I think people mean well when they re-use words like this. It certainly sounds more serious to say that such-and-such is a right. The problem is that when talking about the structure of the system overall, as opposed to just the change you are suggesting, you need to know what things are and where things fit together. I think this structural knowledge of the theory behind the way things are supposed to fit together -- the design pattern of the country if you like -- has been lost over time. now politicians just ask ""what do people want"", then spin it up to sound as dramatic as possible, then throw hundreds or thousands of pages of legislation at it until it looks as if it's been ""fixed"".

It can just create more of it. It just makes no sense to look at the federal government (or any monetarily sovereign government for that matter) in terms of how much money they make.<p>On the other hand, if government revenues are increased by less than 1$, this means that someone, somewhere in the economy now has more net financial assets because of that.<p>Is that a bad thing?

Here's why:<p>1) It's not something that's going to pass. It's not like the White House got together with members of the opposing party and came out with a bipartisan document that would survive the election cycle. There's no indication of having the votes necessary, there's little or no coordination with members of their own party on the hill, and there's no competing sets of legislation where this would be a beginning negotiating position.<p>2) The fixes required, I believe, are going to have to be constitutional amendments. Something like this would be a nice effort (if it had a chance of passing), but the situation is so murky that we need real absolutes, a real set of rights, not an addition to the current system.<p>I'm left with the somewhat sad conclusion that this only begins to firm up opposition in the Republican party -- although they'd never admit it with Ron Paul currently doing so well in their polls. This is a statement something along the lines of ""Hey! We get it! We're on this problem and we want to fix it.""<p>That's a great political statement to make. But I think in terms of actually fixing the problem, it takes us backwards rather than forward. A simple statement along the lines of ""Something is really wrong with online privacy. We look for partners in the opposition party to move this forward immediately."" could have done the same thing without as much counterproductive posturing. I leave it to the reader to determine whether the goal here is actually fixing the problem or staking out a political position for the upcoming election.<p>I remind people, including Ron Paul supporters, that's it's very possible for elements of a party to make all kinds of noise that folks want to hear -- while actually creating a long-term fight that will continue to draw donations and support. There are many scenarios in politics where creating a good fight is much more advantageous than fixing the problem. In my analysis, this is the purpose of that document. I'm desperately hoping over the next couple of years that the Republicans do not rise to the bait.

3625411,comment,3624830,3624830,4,0,mirsadm,,,"Any suggestions for what to do in this situation?<p>I was unfortunate enough to work at a place with a 10+ year old code base where there have been 3 to 4 software architects that have all had their own vision over the years. The code has been refactored many times already. It consisted of a buttload of singletons that were all initialized at seemingly random places. It was impossible to start or shut down the app deterministically.
It was massively multithreaded (in most cases for no good reason). They had this horrible implementation of a shared cache (because many instances of this app ran across many computers that needed to share state).<p>It had no unit tests. Whenever you change anything it would break something entirely different. To me it was an example of everything going wrong...many times.<p>The best part was that it had to run for weeks because it was a critical application (for fire, police and military services). It didn't. They were instructed to reboot all the machines every day. But it wouldn't start up properly every time so they may have to do it multiple times.
I did my best for the year to clean up the critical parts of it. I was contracting there but they had offered me a full time position by the end.<p>I finally cracked it when the original ""software architect"" came back because he had been fired from his old position. He was annoyed that over the years his code had been changed so he started to put back in place everything that he had done before he left. Not only that we had an angry complaint from one of the customers about a possible hostage situation that could have turned very badly because of this crappy system.<p>We tried to reason with the software manager by suggesting that we assign one or two people to start from scratch and take across code that can reused. It would take a bit of time to reach the same feature set as the old application but it had become so difficult to add new features to the old one that it needed to be done.",1330013211

Microsoft changed the game in browser distribution and competing effectively meant that your product had to succeed in several areas, none of which Netscape did. A string of inept management and product decisions didn't help either.<p>I would interpret Joel's point as: Not shipping something for years and then shipping unstable crap is a bad idea. In this case, it ruined people's already shaky confidence in Netscape. Rewriting to improve code isn't always a bad thing - in this case it did end up paying off, just too late to benefit Netscape. Firefox probably wouldn't have happened if the switch of codebases hadn't been made.

8711400,comment,8709205,8711382,0,0,_dps,,,"You touch on many things I have thought about for years :)<p>I think the Mountain View / Palo Alto / Sunnyvale area mirrors  the San Gabriel valley structure pretty closely (with Palo Alto ~= Pasadena, Menlo Park+Atherton ~= San Marino, Sunnyvale+Mountain View ~= Glendale+Burbank). So in that sense they are similar in one particular region.<p>On the other hand, LA downtown is <i>surrounded</i> by confederate townships. San Francisco is in some sense a city on a hill. Similarly, there is nothing like the Venice / Santa Monica / Malibu cluster providing &quot;coastal&quot; political influence to the city. There is no way that, e.g., Pacifica or Half Moon Bay would ever be able to be first class citizens in local politics the way that Venice/Santa Monica/Malibu are in LA politics.<p>Continuing the contrast, the LA area doesn&#x27;t really have anything like the East Bay.<p>I could go on and on, but I will leave it at that for now. I do think that anyone who thinks they have an opinion on LA, but hasn&#x27;t lived there, should take a moment and think that maybe it really is different from their expectations or previous experience of large cities.<p>Edit: one could, I suppose, say that Long Beach is, in some sense, analogous to the East Bay. They are parallel in an economic and social class sense, but I still think the East Bay is much more of a cultural component of SFBA than Long Beach is of LA Metro.",1417931946

8711397,comment,8707178,8707178,0,0,mindvirus,,,"The first thing to determine is what your culture is, and then define what it means for someone to fit or not fit that culture. It&#x27;s not whether you like the person, which is a mistake that a lot of companies make. Write it down - your culture isn&#x27;t something that you should be ashamed of. Is your culture really &quot;aggressive people who speak English well&quot;? Would you put this on your website? Once you&#x27;ve defined your culture, filtering against it becomes much more clear I think.<p>Some core cultural values that I think all companies should share are honesty, integrity and accountability. Is the person willing to admit times that they made mistakes? Do they take ownership of these mistakes? Do they allocate credit to others when talking about their accomplishments (important for everyone, doubly so for managers)? Do they complain about former companies and coworkers? Do you feel that they blame others frequently? Are they upfront about their work history and experience? Is their resume honest - if you ask them about a project they worked on, do you find out that it&#x27;s not really what they wrote? These are all cultural questions, and grounds to accept or reject a candidate on lack of culture fit for. These things should be explicitly important, and should be actively interviewed for.<p>Other grounds could be development philosophy or work culture. These are some examples:<p>- Perhaps you are in a shop that has a heavy focus on extensive unit and regression testing, and you meet an otherwise strong candidate who thinks that testing is important, but largely overrated.<p>- Or perhaps you&#x27;re an established team, working on an established codebase, and you find a developer who largely prefers to rewrite software over maintaining it.<p>- Or perhaps you are in a team which has periods of high stress due to the nature of your business or organization, and you meet someone who doesn&#x27;t work well under pressure.<p>- Perhaps the role requires someone willing to stand their ground, and you meet someone who seems like a pushover. Or perhaps the team already has some strong personalities, and you don&#x27;t want to add another.<p>- Or you could be a company that values work-life balance, and meet someone who thrives on high pressure jobs.<p>- You might be a hectic new startup, and interview someone who prefers to have a clear career path, well defined tasks and meticulous tracking of issues and work (although seriously consider such a person, as they might just organize your lives)<p>- Or you have the reverse - someone who sees issue tracking as needless bureaucracy, in an organization that has a a fair amount of it.<p>However the danger is, unless it is defined, it becomes arbitrary. Realize that you are racist, you are sexist, you are ageist, and you are biased in a million unfair ways that you don&#x27;t even know. Everyone is. And so having an arbitrary and undefined filter such as &quot;culture fit&quot; runs the risk of exposing those biases.",1417931838

8711382,comment,8709205,8711164,0,0,cfallin,,,"> It is much more like a loose federation of nearby townships than it is a city<p>I&#x27;m finding this same pattern in the Bay Area too (moved to Mountain View last spring). Does this match your experience? I&#x27;ve never explored LA.<p>In any case, the many-small-town structure is kind of disorienting coming from a another city with a central, lively downtown, but I can also sort of see an appeal that the locality has. People who live in e.g. Mountain View or Palo Alto or Redwood City feel like they have a nice, small-town &quot;main street&quot; nearby in a way that most suburbs don&#x27;t. Done right, small federated towns are not necessarily a bad way to scale. (Putting housing-density issues aside, of course; Mountain View in particular has a really nasty supply-constraint problem now that more and denser apartment buildings would go a long way toward solving.)<p>That said, there are things that you can&#x27;t find in your own town, so you rely on the regional federated structure for those things, and then you have transportation issues because (i) it&#x27;s less efficient to cover the decentralized area with mass transit than to build a spoke-and-hub system around a real downtown, and (ii) regional political coordination to build/improve systems like Caltrain/BART is <i>much</i> harder when you have a distributed governance structure. (Does LA have similar problems with coordinating city governments?)<p>So I think I prefer the &#x27;single big central lively downtown&#x27; model better but both models are interesting, IMHO.",1417931294

8711373,comment,8711284,8711312,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"I was going to post the following (below -----), but I read the stories and they mainly focus on the signup process for Uber. While I still mostly feel like my original post, it is troublesome to hear that Uber employs people with no background check or verification into a job which, if you think about it, entails a trust-relationship not unlike that of a doctor or cleaning lady/man: someone in in an intimate setting who you entrust to care for you. For a doctor it&#x27;s obvious, a cleaner enters your home, where you trust they don&#x27;t steal sneakily or assault you. And for a taxi driver who drives you home at night, you expect when you hire through a large company that you&#x27;re in the hands of a professional you can trust. Not a person who went through background checks/verification/training as much as if you took a random stranger and put them in a car.<p>So to that extent I&#x27;d say Uber has a lot of work to do in its signup process. But beyond that, it still feels like an incident that doesn&#x27;t justify a post on HN. I wonder what the process is like for regular taxi companies in India and if it&#x27;s much different. Did you guys remember the Polish woman who was raped earlier this year in a non-uber Indian taxi?<p>------ original post below -------<p>As horrible as this is, it&#x27;s a non-story for me. That&#x27;s not to say the rape isn&#x27;t horrible. But we need relevance, we can&#x27;t just report any horrible fact. About 17k children die each day, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to fill HN with that daily unless there is some direct relevance. If we didn&#x27;t have a &#x27;relevance filter&#x27;, I nor anyone else would visit this particular community anymore.<p>Now what&#x27;s the relevance here? Uber? And...?<p>Imagine an employee from Microsoft raped someone (pretty much 100% guaranteed one of them did in the past decades). Should that be a story we talk about on HN, just because it&#x27;s bad and because it&#x27;s a tech company and no other reason? Of course not. So why should it be a story that a non-employee freelance driver rapes someone in a country of over 1 billion people?<p>Look if this story had a sociological context about gender relations in India that was interesting for HN, sure. I&#x27;d love to read about that. My girlfriend was just in India this summer for social work and we chat about this every now and then. If it was a story about gender-violent policies at Uber, sure, that&#x27;d be interesting. If this was a story about how Uber attracts disproportionately higher rates of criminal drivers, sure. But there&#x27;s none of that.<p>So I don&#x27;t see the relevance, and without any kind of trend, evidence of bad policies or whatever, it&#x27;s just a single incident. Shit happens, and without context this is a story that smears a company. I&#x27;m no fan of Uber, but there&#x27;s a lot better things to focus on IF this was an incident.<p>Anyway I&#x27;d be happy to hear otherwise, I could totally be missing something.",1417931061

After spending considerable time rendering my pages by building XML and applying XSLT, I found a lot of the skills transfer.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve been working a lot in React, and I&#x27;ve found that just understanding the new syntax can be learned in a weekend -- instead of transforming an XML doc, I load JSON into my state, and instead of writing <xsl:template>s I write React classes. The sort of skills that one refines over years, namely how to think of your rendered page as being composed of various smaller templates, benefit me everywhere. XSLT was a really intensive way to force myself to learn to think that way. Even my mixed PHP/HTML that I occasionally still have to write is considerably better.<p>to your point about XSLT v1, I can speak to why it&#x27;s so rarely used at least by PHP devs: v1 has been included as a default extension in PHP builds for many years, but v2 has always required a separate installation of saxon. I just checked on my reasonably up-to-date ubuntu default install, and it&#x27;s XSLT 1.1.28.

Not because I agree with her main thrust, her characterization of the orthodox view, or her conclusions about it, but because resisting the book in good conscience requires summoning foundational primary sources that practitioners don&#x27;t have to handle very often. If you lead right, it&#x27;s good to fight a southpaw from time to time.<p>When recommending it to those who aren&#x27;t corporate attorneys or otherwise involved in the subject matter, I include a caveat: If this is the only book you read on corporate governance, be aware that it&#x27;s a controversial and contrarian book packaged for non-lawyers. If its subject were political, I could find and recommend a book arguing the opposite view it in a similar style. I&#x27;m not aware of any legal rebuttal that isn&#x27;t presented in more traditionally legal, less approachable form. It&#x27;s been reviewed in legal journals, but even most lawyers consider those long-winded and dense.",1417928527

8711293,comment,8710350,8711283,0,0,TD-Linux,,,"Right. The real jump from small to large RAM devices is the presence or absence of DRAM.<p>Large SRAMs get costly and power hungry quick - the largest RAM Cortex-M4 devices have about 192KiB of SRAM, but cost $6-10. The jump to DRAM, however, is very expensive, because DRAM is fabricated on a different process and needs to be installed as a separate die or package. It is also too high latency to use as the only RAM, so a SRAM cache is still necessary.<p>The market currently segregates a lot of other features based on the RAM interface. Cortex-M series cores, sold as &quot;microcontrollers&quot;, almost never have DRAM, only support Thumb-2, and have no MMU. Cortex-A series are sold as &quot;application processors&quot;, have external DRAM interfaces, and include a MMU. A similar divide is visible with the MIPS architecture.",1417928493

I popped out the hard disk, put it in an external FireWire enclosure, and I plug it into my MacBook Pro when I'm at home.  So now I'm 100% reliant on the laptop, and perfectly happy.  I'll buy peripheral machines (iPhone, tablet, etc.), but I don't plan to buy another desktop.",1198468437

You don't provide much detail about the nature of your startup, but ""small is beautiful"" if you want to maintain control. Find a niche market that has a problem you bring unique value to. <p>Once it's more than just you in the startup--whether it's partners, employees, or customers--you will need to sell your ideas and to compromise to achieve your larger mission. If it's a work of art or a hobby then you can be in complete control and not worry whether it's salable or appreciated. But if it's a business it will involve negotiation and compromise. <p>The Japanese have a phrase ""if he works for you, you work for him"" that is a good precept when it comes to attracting and retaining employees. Many early stage startups are effectively volunteer organizations, so you need to think through how you are going to attract and retain the talent you need until you get to positive cash flow. <p>Borrowing money is a recipe for getting started but you have to have a realistic plan for how you will pay it back. This is why investors are so demanding as well, most don't really want to run your company, they just want a return on their investment. <p>In the end it's positive cash flow that allows you to maintain control, and whether it's from consulting or from product sales it's from paying customers. And they exercise  a fair amount of control in their own way.<p>So if you want to be in control I would stop developing and  start selling, making sure that someone wants to pay for what you are planning to build.",1198467789

Especially if ads are part of the intended eventual revenue model, getting them started early is more honest with your users, and starts your ad-optimization learning cycle. (In some cases, ads will even make a site look more professional/stable.)<p>If your userbase is such that it may react negatively, and you still need the money, consider a donation or subscription option. Or sell part of the venture, if the eventual upside can justify the trouble for you and risk for  investors.",1198467673

If you don't need a lot of power or obscure features then there's no lost functionality, and if you're already familiar, you have no learning curve.<p>I think that already knowing how to use it is a pretty good reason to use it.",1198467184
92327,comment,92270,92312,0,0,icky,,,"> Sounds like this guy just doesn't want to waste time.<p>:)<p>> You have to be reasonable if you expect good relations with someone. The developer should provide a higher estimate that provides a buffer for the uncertainty involved. Get a written spec before signing the contract.<p>Exactly.  (Although if the client agrees to a certain project scope, I don't mind writing the spec for them to sign off on).  The other side of it is, good clients <i>should</i> get more wiggle room, but you've got to have a strategy for avoiding horror stories.",1198466510

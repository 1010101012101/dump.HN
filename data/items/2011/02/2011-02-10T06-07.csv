Gave up a $4K 15"" MBP with 8GB and SSD for it, and haven't regretted the decision once in 3 months or so.<p>MBA is much quieter (fan rarely runs, when it does it's much quieter), way more comfy on the lap or in bed, much cooler, and has a strikingly better display (brighter, crisper, slightly smaller size no big deal since rez the same).<p>I work in a Rails + MongoDB stack plus do a lot of design, so I'll routinely have RubyMine, Photoshop, Illustrator, mongod, mongrels, 3 browsers, and a few dozen browser tabs open at once.<p>If I had to make the purchase again, I'd get the 4GB model, since it's RAM that usually limits me, even though the swapping is fast with SSD.<p>Miss the Firewire occasionally since I like to use a Duet to lay down guitar tracks in Logic, but will probably get a dedicated iMac for the studio soon.",1297321127

(And nobody was able to over the long term in the Twentieth Century in passive investments.) If you put your money in the stock market over the past decade, for example, your return would be zero.  And this is one of the best times to be cashing out.  Most of the last decade would have produced negative returns.<p>Less risky investments like government bonds typically return less than 1% over inflation.  If you intend to save for retirement and hope to benefit from compounding, you should be prepared to depend on 1% or less returns.  One percent returns will double your money in seventy-two years.<p>If you want to retire on more than Social Security, you should be prepared to save every penny you'd like to spend. Compound investment returns have always been unreliable and the development of modern finance may have eliminated those returns forever by shifting all gains to banking executives.<p>Social Security is doing much better by comparison.  Or you could get yourself a government pension;  those are insanely generous.",1297321065

I've been studying Kenpo, one of the most violent martial arts, for the past 2.5 years. Usually when you are sparring, there is a mutual level of respect. You aren't out there trying to kill each other, its not like an MMA fight on TV. It is also not like boxing, you are standing 2 feet away from each other just trading blows.<p>Most studios will let you sit and watch a class before signing up. If it looks like there are a couple of tough guys trying to take people's heads off, just walk away, it is not a good studio. Those types of lunk heads never last more than a few weeks in a real studio because after sparring with a more experienced student, they won't want to come back.<p>People get hurt, but it has never been from a shot to the head. In the vast majority of cases, the injuries are been self inflicted. A broken finger, a smashed shin, a broken toe, usually the result of poor technique due to frustration.",1297320683

Someone finally caught it recently and put a <i>static</i> in there.<p>The critical <i>add_action</i>/<i>do_action</i> functions had a slowdown issue up to a few versions ago if there were more than a dozen actions on a filter. It was finally optimized to be hundreds of times faster.<p>The first time they tried to update the cookie functions for a major release (I think it was 2.5) they misunderstood the research paper and had to change cookies again in 2.6, breaking some plugins twice in two versions.<p>The meta tables until very recent history were allowed to have non-unique indexes on key values. This ""feature"" (an alternative to serialization) was almost never used and made meta updates much more complex (and the db slower in general).<p>The entire tag db structure was changed in version 2.3, breaking all tag plugins, because someone thought it was theoretically better to have a ""Term_taxonomy"" reference - which is still unused to this date. Having it in there makes tag queries much more complex and slower. Then they took out the timestamp for when tags were added which makes it impossible to track.<p>The list goes on and on. Remember, a few versions ago is still 2009.<p>Last time I checked (2.8?) WordPress <i>still</i> uses SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS which has some nasty performance problems on many versions of mysql.<p>To this day, the query count for most pages on a default install with a few posts/comments without plugins is over 20. WordPress 3.1 now uses nearly 1 megabyte of php code PER INSTANCE.<p>Oh and last but not least, ALL plugins are loaded on EVERY page load regardless of the request/rendering requirements.

Not to the using of it or acquiring of it. You can buy and acquire a bitcoin fairly quickly and cheaply, CPU/electricity-wise. Much more so than if you had to ""mine"" it. Much like dollars.

	- the template:
		<div class=""page""> is the wrapper
		you can add the 'liquid' class to make your design fluid<p>- the grid:
	line / unit sizeXonY or lastUnit,
	the sizeXonY give the width of the 'cell', lastUnit permit the last <div>  of a line to take the left place.<p>line contains unit, 
	no margin or padding on unit (Groxx , to keep the percentage true (4 x25% = 100% vs 4x(25% + 10px (ie.margin)) > 100%)<p>- the block : see <a href=""http://oocss.org/module.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oocss.org/module.html</a>

4605591,comment,4605139,4605139,2,0,_kst_,,,"He's wrong. A pointer, at least in C, is not a number, and saying that it is just causes confusion.<p>Pointers have <i>some</i> of the same properties as numbers (specifically integers). In particular, you can do arithmetic on them -- but only in a very restricted way. You can add or subtract an integer to a pointer, yielding a pointer, and you can subtract a pointer from a pointer, yielding an integer.<p>Most current architectures have a single monolithic addressing space, and pointers can be treated as indices into that address space, treated as a very large array. But the C standard is carefully written to permit other memory models.<p>For example, pointers to distinct objects cannot meaningfully be subtracted or compared, except for equality or inequality.<p>Sure, a pointer is represented as a sequence of bits, and that sequence of bits can be treated as an integer -- but the mapping is unspecified. Similarly, a floating-point representation can be mapped onto an integer representation; that doesn't mean that the integer value 1069547520 will help you understand the floating-point number 1.5.<p>A pointer is a pointer. If you want to understand how pointers work, learn about pointers.<p>See also sections 4 and 6 of the comp.lang.c FAQ at <a href=""http://www.c-faq.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.c-faq.com/</a>.",1349232935

It's true that all of Valve's games do this and it also might be true that all the new software (not games) being added will need to follow this policy (I'm not sure). It certainly isn't true for large amounts of AAA games already on Steam though.<p>Developers and publishers are allowed to add any DRM they want on top of Steam, and frequently do. So you can purchase something through Steam, which can have Securom, Tages, Windows LIVE or any other DRM scheme. This includes limited machine installations which sometimes offer deactivation, but only if you specifically uninstall and deactivate them. So in your reformatting use-case, depending on what games you have purchased, you may end up in the same situation.<p>Basically, you incorrectly assumed Steam is an alternative to other DRM measures, when in fact it's quite often[1] used on top of other DRM schemes. If you don't believe me, simply check the store pages of most major Ubisoft[2] titles. I just picked Anno 2070 (because I know it has it) and in the infobox on the right hand side:<p>3rd-party DRM: Solidshield Tages SAS\n3 machine activation limit<p>[1]Among AAA titles that is, I have yet to see it in any indie titles.\n[2]Pretty much the worst player in the industry when it comes to DRM.",1349232676

Basically, take people out for casual lunches, but do it ALL THE TIME, try to help them even if they can't help you right now, introduce people to other people who can help them, etc.<p>Then the hard part, get used to talking to strangers.  If you want to learn sales, you have to get over that fear.  I'd say start, get used to saying hi to everyone you encounter throughout the day and trying to have a friendly conversation--hard for an introvert, but like going to the gym, it'll make you stronger and that subtle social confidence will pay off in a sales meeting. (Plus, you never know what random interaction will lead to a sales meeting).<p>Also, to be honest, there are a lot of similarities between closing a sale and dating.  The difficulty is that in the second you're selling yourself, so rejection stings a lot more and the approaches can be a little scarier.  That said, if you can strike up a conversation with a strange man or woman you find attractive and get them interested in you, you'll have no problem learning to sell any other reasonable product.",1349231764

After raising the issue that this type of message leaks data, which is a completely valid concern, they dropped it because they were already leaking that data elsewhere? It isn't like email based account reset/reminder forms have to leak the existence of an email within the system, a fact they just gloss right over.<p>For a system that stores quite a lot of very sensitive data it is surprising to see them knowingly keep such a hole open. I understand the desire to smooth out the user experience but this honestly seems more driven by the desire to not field customer support requests for what feels like a ""stupid issue"".<p>I'm not currently a MailChimp customer but I used to be and before reading this I would have chosen to use them again if the need was there.

In almost every other case you either don&#x27;t care about `this` or you want to use the containing function&#x27;s `this` value. Arrow functions are perfect for these cases.",1398967195

While you can certainly persist it locally (so the user sees the same thing when he reopens the site/application), it seems odd to persist it remotely and not persist props (the application state).<p>Now I understand that the homepage demo uses state, so demoing based on that is fair enough, but building a mixin to remotely persist state?",1398967189

I was happy to do it.  I had lots of friends at my old high school, my parents bought a business that was located an hour from our residence, and they pitched the idea of buying a house and moving.<p>I was in a private school, Catholic, but professed atheist so not very popular with my religion teacher, among other religious teachers, and it was causing my overall GPA to suffer when I had long been a Straight-A student.  I switched to a public school more local to the business, graduated third in my class (better than my previous rank in about equal class size), and wound up being able to go to RIT (Rochester, NY) on a decent set of scholarships, with lots of help from my parents.<p>But more importantly I had just recently gotten really good at making friends, and recognized that taking a year to make some new friends before going off to college was going to be good practice for later.<p>Anyway, there was no end to the line of people ready to tell me how good it was of me to go along with the idea in my last year of high school, and to not throw tantrums or put up a zillion roadblocks, tell my parents they were ruining my social life by making me change schools, or feeling any of the thousand other ways that a teenage kid can feel gravely slighted by their parents or family when they need to move or make some other major change for some reason, when they are just trying to go on living their lives and do what&#x27;s best.<p>A lot of my friends would not have been nearly so happy to move and change schools, I&#x27;ll admit that.

This is also called a core.<p>Falcon 9 heavy (no crossfeed) has a first stage and a second stage. But the first stage consists of 3 cores that run in parallel. All three cores start and stop at the same time. So 27 engines start at the pad.<p>Falcon 9 heavy with crossfeed has sort of two or three stages, depending how you count. Outwards it looks very similar to the no-crossfeed Falcon 9 heavy. The topmost stage is similar to the two already mentioned configurations. The three cores look pretty similar. All three cores start at the pad (27 engines running), but the propellant for the center core&#x27;s engines is taken from the outer cores&#x27; tanks. This means the outer cores run out of propellants quite quickly. They can then be discarded in flight, and the center core starts using propellants from its own tanks. Now it can fly without the dead mass of the outer cores and as a result the rocket can carry a bigger payload.<p>Why start the core engine at the pad, and not make it a real second stage that starts up only higher? Because then you get more thrust, the engines are not dead weight during early flight.<p>Some rockets like Titan IV had a somewhat similar parallel configuration but they did not start their center engine except at high altitude.",1398966522

I don&#x27;t understand how I&#x27;d have my own ports tree in a sensible way (do you have a couple of trees? Build package A from here, package B from there?), when you need stuff that just isn&#x27;t ported/too &#x27;niche&#x27;.

Admittedly I never used it for more than pointing to one single official mirror in the couple of VMs I played with. Anyway: Cool.<p>I&#x27;m not married to jails, I just like that poudriere offers a very nice way to build packages in an isolated environment. Security isn&#x27;t the biggest concern here: One thing that this allows me to do for example is to run one version of FreeBSD and build packages in a jail of another version (or another arch, or both). At this point I assume there&#x27;s an OpenBSD equivalent for this functionality as well though. :)<p>My feelings about pkg_* are honestly based on older experiences with FreeBSD and recent but discontinued explorations in NetBSD. My last OpenBSD installation is a while back and I might&#x27;ve given up quite quickly.

7681319,comment,7679372,7681192,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Right. OK. So with a simple 2-stage rocket like the Falcon 9 you have the first stage which has the 2nd stage stacked on top of it which has the payload stacked on top of it. During a normal flight the first stage (which is the biggest stage) lights, lifts the whole thing off the ground, and pushes the rocket up into the air and starts getting it up to speed. Then the first stage runs out of fuel, it separates and then the 2nd stage takes over, pushing the payload the rest of the way to orbit.<p>The Falcon Heavy uses the same &quot;2nd&quot; stage but it uses 3 first stages instead of just one, which are called &quot;cores&quot;. Each core is just a Falcon 9 first stage, for the most part. The idea of the Falcon Heavy (similar to the way the Delta IV Heavy works) is that you have three times as many first stages pushing, which leads to increased payload.<p>With the cross-feed option you end up with effectively a 3-stage launcher. The outer two cores becomes like the first stage, and they are jettisoned when empty, then you have the inner core which now becomes a 2nd stage, and the previous 2nd stage is now a 3rd stage (or just &quot;upper stage&quot;, to avoid confusion).<p>But, as mentioned, when you fly this way the 2nd stage core ends up way faster and way farther away when it&#x27;s done thrusting, so in the prospect of having it keep around some extra propellant so it can thrust back to the launch site and land so it can be reused becomes much more difficult. But in a worst-case scenario all of the &quot;cores&quot; can be run at the same time, so they burn out the same distance away from land and can each return and be reused (saving a lot of money). You end up with only a 2 stage vehicle (3 1st-stages all running at the same time plus the upper stage) which would decrease performance, but because you recover all of the first stage cores (instead of only 2/3 of them) the cost benefit would probably be worth the payload reduction.",1398965775

Our CEO is Richard Price who received his PhD from Oxford in Philosophy and is an avid sailor.  Our team is also led by CTO Ben Lund who is not only a great technical leader, but also an amazing foosball player.<p>We are well-funded by Khosla Ventures and we are on a mission to Open Science.  Our goal as a company is to build an end-to-end publication system that provides the world with free and accessible academic and scientific papers.  So far we have 9,364,002 users.<p>Feel free to check out the technical projects that our engineers are tackling (see below) or visit our hiring page at <a href=""https://www.academia.edu/hiring"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.academia.edu/hiring</a> to learn more about us.  We look forward to hearing from you.<p>We are Hiring a Team to Build a Better Future<p>Here at Academia.edu you will have an opportunity to join an agile team of 9 Engineers who are all making a positive impact on the world by contributing to a movement called Open Science.  As a member of our team you will be given a lot of autonomy to choose projects that interest you the most and the ability to make product decisions with our CTO Ben Lund and CEO Richard Price.<p>We are currently tackling five incredibly difficult product challenges.  Some of these projects have been attempted by larger companies and have failed.  In order to be successful we will need to think way outside-of-the-box and take a leap into the unknown…<p>Peer Review<p>We want to build a peer review platform that allows layers of discussion on top of a single document.  One of the biggest challenges we face is that contextual commenting at a large scale has yet to be achieved.  In order to be successful we need to find original and novel solutions because simple approaches like putting a blog-style comment box at the end of the paper has been tried before and has not been effective.<p>To build Peer Review we must figure out a way to transform all the wide array of styles from any given PDF paper to a clean and consistent format that is embedded for a suitable commenting UI.  We are experimenting to build a rich inline-commenting and discussion interface as well as a reputation system that surfaces quality comments.<p>Interface Design<p>We currently have 7.5 million users who upload their research papers.  Academia converts these PDFs to HTLM5 to display in the browser.  We face the challenges of building web UIs for scientific content such as 3D molecular visualizations and tools for exploring genetic sequences.  We will also build back-end parsers, converters, and storage schemes to enable these UIs.<p>Recommendation Engine<p>We have a news feed that displays recommended papers to our users.  Currently we use a simple rule-based system where papers are tagged by research interests and our users can follow those research interests.  In addition, our users can follow each other.  We want our users to feel as if they are attending an amazing conference where everything we show them is the most relevant and up-to-date information that is available in their field.<p>In order to improve our recommendation engine, we will be immersed in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  We want to identify which particular field of the paper it correlates to (math, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) and the type of document (original research, a review article, a conference presentation, a lecture note or some other content).  Using everything from a paper’s previous viewers on Academia.edu to its author and content to its place in the citation graph, we want to determine the relevance of a particular document to a particular user.  Lastly, using large-scale data analysis we want to identify trending papers, highlight influential researchers and help the public uncover important new work more quickly and reliably.<p>Mobile App<p>Academia does not have a mobile app but we are dedicated to building one!<p>Working with a clean slate, we will design and build a mobile API that displays Academia’s core features.  These features will include the user profile, upload papers, news feed, analytic data, and the ability to make comments on papers (Peer Review).  In order to build a dynamic mobile API, we will write easy-to-use client libraries in a wide range of scripting languages that will encourage integration with Academia’s data, content and identity into their apps.<p>Speed, Scale, & Storage<p>Our engineering team will have to build highly scalable systems that effectively store and analyze our entire stream of hits.  We have built an analytics dashboard so that every user can see how many people viewed their profile and how many people have read their uploaded papers.  We enabled this feature by storing structured data in DynamoDB- currently 343 million rows and growing 10% per month.  We want to build features that require more sophisticated aggregations on this data than DynamoDB can provide.<p>Furthermore we will need to figure out how to effectively store massive amounts of data while increasing the speed of our product especially to parts of the world where there is slower internet connections.  This is important because areas in the world with slower connections tend to be where researchers can benefit the most from open access to research.  Our platform must be useable for them too.<p>Future at Academia.edu<p>We have a fun and agile team and we are growing (our site usage grows 10% per month)!  We have the resources to make our mission come true.  We just raised $11 million from Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures.<p>Apply<p>If you think you would be interested in solving some of these technical problems, then please do not hesitate to contact ashley@academia.edu.  Or if you are interested in chatting with our CEO Richard or meeting the team for a game of foosball, then let us know as you are more than welcome to drop by our office in Downtown San Francisco.",1398965416

It doesn&#x27;t matter whether a block of zeroes is stored or not: it still reads as zero.  So a cloud provider only needs to store non-zero blocks, and thus doesn&#x27;t need to provision the full capacity to back a volume.<p>As to whether EC2 does this I don&#x27;t know - based on your observations they may not.

You can&#x27;t do much without quickly running into threading issues. I played audio files in a game I made and it created up to 2,000 threads and crashed. Once I wrapped audio in an explicitly created thread this issue magically went away. Any kind of UI, timers, file I/O and network activity also involves threads.<p>The really horrible thing about these threads in Java is how hard it is to not share memory across them, because if you do terrible things happen. In other platforms you don&#x27;t have to involve threads unless you want to, and you definitely aren&#x27;t boxed into a situation where it becomes easy to accidentally share memory across theads.<p>I like Go&#x27;s way of handling this. node.js is single threaded but the event loop makes it possible to do non-blocking IO without crazy Jave thread issues. Using synchronized, atomic properties and locks is not the right way to do these things as your code gets really complicated when trying to do basic things.<p>That gets me to my other pet peeve with Java. Just how much boiler plate there is to do basic things like opening up encrypted TLS TCP connections. Tons of cruft.<p>Anyway, having said that, I love Java and use it, but these things need addressing. I like Scala&#x27;s Akka, I hope Java comes around and improves the horrible thread situation. I will have to check out Quasar. I know I just need to become more familiar with threading in Java in general. I&#x27;m actually pretty new to Java.",1398964910

In addition to the lack of a pedestrian culture, US does not much of a concept of &quot;communal life&quot;.

That&#x27;s not to say that you can&#x27;t use it. People have worked through SICP in Arc. The question is what makes this better than MIT Scheme or Racket?<p>I&#x27;ve read through PG&#x27;s tutorial. It claims to be for anyone, but there&#x27;s a lot of discussion about fairly specific Lisp idioms - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all too beginner friendly. In fairness, introductory tutorials where the messy interwoven details of the real world are left out doesn&#x27;t seem to be consistent with PG&#x27;s thinking, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s a big fan of dumbing things down, but I could be wrong.<p>Unlike Racket, Arc is very much batteries not included. And there aren&#x27;t libraries full of them. Almost anything you want, you will need to build yourself. It&#x27;s the hard way that&#x27;s harder than Zed Shaw.

The documentation and community is pretty strong and it forces you to think about side effects and use strong static typing.<p>I don&#x27;t like Python. I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried. Parenthesis may be visually unappealing, syntactic white space is mentally unappealing. And the whole 2/3 incompatibility suggests IE 6 and Cobol [which I find Cobol actually interesting with it&#x27;s focus on data and emphasis on readabiilty]. Maybe if I was doing scientific computing, I&#x27;d use Python, but only if I could not afford Mathematica.<p>To me, and one of the reasons I wanted to like Python is that I grew up watching Flying Circus in the 70&#x27;s, turned my son on to Holy Grail when he was five [thereby giving him an excuse to blame me for his adult problems], and have the 16 Ton DVD&#x27;s. But my snarky conclusion is that Python needs the gimmick to distract attention from it&#x27;s warts. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me, though. Spam and eggs is cute, but it the effort might have been better spent.<p>Python is better designed than JavaScript. But JavaScript is unapologetically kludgy as to merit respect.<p>I do like Ruby. It&#x27;s design is elegant and for general scripting, it&#x27;s going to be just as fast. Mix in mixins for objects and blocks for higher level function passing and it&#x27;s got a lot going for it. One of the big things for me that it has over Python is explicit `end` statements for blocks - Python ends blocks by indentation which means that formatting errors can give GOTOfail type errors.<p>Coming back to Scala, it reminds me of ML. It has the same sort of light syntax. The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t use it over Python is the overhead of the Java platform - if you&#x27;ve got Java&#x27;s libraries, you probably don&#x27;t need Python&#x27;s.<p>If you&#x27;re on Windows, then C# and F# and TypeScript make a lot of sense. Lot&#x27;s of documentation, lots of libraries, solid IDE, and the equivalent of the JVM you get for free.<p>Prolog is pretty cool.

7681054,comment,7679372,7680810,4,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The Falcon Heavy uses 3 identical cores as the &quot;first stage&quot; of the vehicle. If each of the stages burns at the same rate and burns out at the same time then it&#x27;s basically just one big stage and the Falcon Heavy would just be a 2-stage launcher. Adding more stages increases payload performance of launchers because you&#x27;re dumping dead weight. The plan for the Falcon Heavy is to have cross feed between the engines so that effectively the center stage&#x27;s engines are run off the outer stages&#x27; fuel tanks until those tanks are dry. Then the outer stages separate and the center stage fires alone (as a 2nd stage) until it is depleted, then the upper stage fires (as a 3rd stage), massively increasing overall payload.<p>The Delta IV Heavy throttles down the center core during launch and peels away the outer cores first in a sort of &quot;virtual crossfeed&quot; scenario, though this comes at the cost of liftoff thrust.<p>The only problem with crossfeed for the Falcon Heavy is that it leaves the center core traveling a lot faster and a lot farther down range than the first stage of a Falcon 9 normally would be, which might make it a lot harder to return to the launch site for reusability. However, as a worst-case scenario the Falcon Heavy could be operated without crossfeed with all lower stage cores burning out at the same time, which would reduce payload significantly but the cost savings would probably make it worthwhile even so.",1398963673

4759263,comment,4757414,4758381,4,0,Locke1689,,,"The issue here is that affirmative action conflates two separate things. One\nelement of affirmative action is correction for economic disenfranchisement.\nYou're right that maybe we should look at this more broadly and attempt a more\nrace-neutral approach.<p>However, the second horn seeks to correct for prejudice and descrimination, not\npoverty. This is not necessarily heavy-handed correction, like quotas, either.\nFor example, one of the most effective instances is the enforcement of\nblind auditions for orchestras. Almost immediately after the rule was\ninstituted, the demographics of major US orchestras shifted hugely. The point is\nto correct for latent, perhaps even unconcious, descrimination.<p>To understand how even unconcious descrimination can be self-reinforcing,\nconsider someone hiring a new software developer. If they have a team of\nmiddle-class white male software developers and a middle class white male\nsoftware developer applies, they have to give almost no thought to how they will\nintegrate with the team. Sure, there are your corner cases, but we all share a\nlot of the same cultural background. With vulnerable groups, it's not the same.\nIt requires some thought. Since we all don't like to expend mental energy on\nsomething we're not really thrilled about doing in the first place (reading\nresumes, interviewing, hiring), it's just so much <i>easier</i> to pick the white\nmale and be done with it. By putting counterbalances in place we don't have to\nactually favor anybody, we just have to reduce the forcing function in the\nsystem that pushes us towards the status quo.",1352401176

However, an interpolation between those colors based on hue that does not adjust saturation, will look quite ugly, as it passes through magenta, etc. The question is, how should one adjust the saturation?<p>There's nothing wrong with any given color space. It was designed with particular goals in mind, and those goals generally did not include attractive blending through linear interpolation.

We want to appeal to the user's notions of how pigments blend together, but in such a way that the operation is predictable and can be hand tuned to avoid unpleasant cases.

The most raw and visceral forms of slavery and de-facto slavery in the US are most certainly based on power imbalance. Being disproportionately affected by laws and economic policy drafted by mostly white political bodies is a power imbalance. Direct, physical actions by police forces and governments against communities of color is a power imbalance. All of these things are institutional problems regarding race the US faces today and all come back to fundamental power imbalance.<p>> And you can act to counteract an institutional imbalance caused by racism without furthering racism.<p>Absolutely true, and policies such as affirmative action do not further racism but rather attempt to fix a small aspect of it.<p>>  Focus on something else.<p>This is a total derailment. Institutional oppressions are highly linked to racism, to ignore it is to dismiss the criticisms and voices of people of color point this power imbalance out.",1352400157

4759018,comment,4758603,4758866,8,0,jonnathanson,,,"Quality seems to be making a comeback in the US, especially in menswear. We've entered an age where trial is cheaper than ever, and many online sellers offer nearly unconditional return guarantees.<p>The reason large luxury brands compete on image, and not necessarily on quality, is because they can. They've taken years to get there. Many of them are also public companies, so they're under intense pressure to expand profit margins and tighten costs. If Ralph Lauren can make a shirt for $5 and sell it for $50, and could make the same shirt for $2 and sell it for $50, they will take the latter option. Likewise, if they can make it for $5 and sell it for $100, they'll take that option. And if they can make it for $2 and sell it for $100, even better. They're creating shareholder value by doing so, and doing so at scale.<p>Conversely, startup clothing brands typically begin by addressing a specific niche, and addressing that niche's dissatisfaction with the status quo. A friend of mine runs an extremely successful tie company by following this strategy. You might think: why ties? Who actually wears ties these days, and does anyone actually care about their quality? Well, it turns out that, of the set of all people who <i>do</i> wear ties every day, some of the deepest-pocketed and most frequent purchasers of ties care a great deal about quality. Luxury brands have been pissing these people off by cutting corners on quality and coasting on brand image. So...enter my friend's startup, addressing this small but lucrative customer base. Bingo.<p>(Incidentally, Ralph Lauren himself started off selling neckties).",1352398445

What this tells me is that they weren't looking for a model of how colors mix together, but a model of what colors look good together.<p>> ""We know red and yellow should yield orange, or that red and blue should make purple--but there isn't any way to arrive at these colors no matter what color-space you use.""<p>Well, that's clearly not true. In the HSL color wheel [1], orange is halfway between red and yellow, and purple is halfway between red and blue. Should have picked a better example.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.workwithcolor.com/hsl-color-picker-01.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.workwithcolor.com/hsl-color-picker-01.htm</a>",1352397862

You can get by in software development without ever writing a compiler, converting automata, or hunting for K5 in a jumble of lines but I would argue those things can contribute positively to analytic thinking and in those situations where there is a parallel, you can have an intuitive edge.<p>Cross-disciplinary knowledge can be a great advantage as well, physics and economics mesh quite well with computation.<p>In my experience, a CS minor is generally a plus on a resume if you are a recent grad, less so if you graduated 10 years ago and haven't worked on related projects or in development roles.",1352397812

If we offer a superior product at a lower price, and you buy from us and enjoy it, we think you'll be back over and over -- that means we can keep margins a bit lower, and earn a good revenue stream from each supporter over a long period of time. It is a different model. We think we can continue to communicate new things you'll enjoy, and that is something traditional retail just can't do well. They largely have to wait for you to return, or spend absurd amounts on television and magazine advertising in hopes you'll come back.<p>I do think it is a disruptive model; but some things remain the same -- quality matters, and your brand represents who you are. Further, we think in this day-in-age, who you are is increasingly important. A lot of old school apparel brands are a fabrication of some fantasy land... we can't and won't do that.

It's solar power, they just use photosynthesis and the general population gets some use out of the middle step.<p>The reason this is not a good idea to do with CO2 that was taken out of the atmosphere millenia ago is that 1) we don't want that much CO2 back in the atmosphere, and 2) we don't want that much CO2 back in the atmosphere <i>that fast</i>.

Any Firefox dev can tell how terribly hard it is to improve Firefox without breaking addons. GNOME does not have the man power of Mozilla, let alone Apple. They want to create great things by implementing them one at a time.<p>If Gnome doesn't have the resources to do proper UX design, the answer is NOT to force incomplete/broken UX on users. It's to leave options open for others to fix the UX as needed.<p>Design is about making choices, but if you don't have the resources to find/make the best choice at least allow the end user to make the choice they prefer instead.<p>What I find amusing though, is that even OSX allows more customization than Unity/Gnome. In OSX I can turn off backlight dimming on battery, I can move the dock to different sides of the screen (essential for multi-monitor setups), and I can also tweak other things via plists.

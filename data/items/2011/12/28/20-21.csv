She makes a number of them.<p>This passage is what I focused on:<p>""You can protest, argue, call people thieves, stake the moral high ground, and point fingers all you want. There is no obfuscation, everything you have done is right out in the open for everyone to see. More importantly, everything you do is in the ecosystem for people to learn from. I think it's a great proof of concept as I've neverheard anyone get angry at someone else for stealing something they have written for the DOM.\n\nPeople don't run around copy -> pasting things they find elsewhere. For many reasons, mainly, your style comes through in what you write. Your code is your signature, and someone else's never can express your unique type of art. When it does happen (which it does), it is a matter of ethics, not law or government. Clientside JavaScript is policed by the JavaScript community, and if you're a thief that copies and pastes, people know.""<p>That's quite a bit stronger than saying ""client side code can be seen by everyone.""

Why we have both supervised and unsupervised algorithms was made pretty clear to me in the class. And just what more difficult material would you have liked to seen? The real Stanford class is made more difficult largely by doing lots of difficult math proofs. I emphatically disagree with any assertion that this free class should be so math heavy. What would be the purpose of that for the intended audience? Sure, such work would make fine extra credit, but making effective use of algorithms rarely relies on on a ability to mathematically prove that they have the properties that they do.<p>I think that a big final project, as is required in the real Stanford class, on the other hand, would have a lot of utility for the intended audience.

You can do google searches to read up on some other peoples' experiences, but presumably you won't believe them either. You could read 4 Hour Body, which has pics, but I guess you won't believe that either. I don't know what to tell you, but it happened. You could ask anyone at the SEM firm I work at, many of whom I convinced to do CrossFit with me, what changes in my physique were readily apparent.<p>An interesting side-effect from the experience is that I finally diagnosed my angioedema without major urticaria that I'd been having since I was twelve, off-and-on. I'd always had swelling of the face or fingers or tongue or throat, periodically, that would occur in the morning. It went away for some years, but came back a couple years ago. It wasn't coincident with any particular food or activity so it was hard to see how it could be a food allergy. I would take Zyrtec once a day to manage it. However, after going on GOMAD, I couldn't manage it anymore, it was getting to dangerous levels. I went to an immunologist who didn't know what was happening either. After extensive research, I discovered that some people are sensitive to the casein protein found in the milk from common breeds of cattle in the US. It breaks down into an opioid in the body, and some of us produce a histamine response from it. I thank the a2milk company of Australia for providing the resources to help me figure it out. I've since been able to keep the acquired muscle by taking pure whey protein with water.<p>Anyway, so unless you think I just made up that food intolerance anecdote, yeah, it happened.",1325105653

I store these passwords in an encrypted container that I reference whenever I want to use the site. The passwords I use are always huge, but I leave punctuation out for convenience in selecting the text with double-click. :) I think that my alphanumeric mixed-case very long passwords are safe enough without requiring punctuation.<p>I also occasionally run into length limits on passwords which I'm sure we all agree is silly. But encouraging enforcement of complexity standards somehow seems to make some people think they can place arbitrary limits for the convenience of their VARCHAR() fields or something.<p>People will either use a password they can remember or reset their password every time they go to your site, which will not only make it really annoying to use your site but also doesn't do much good anyway since the password is then behind their weakly-passworded email account.<p>I understand that exposing this information allows an attacker to know more about my potential passwords and maybe to enhance his ability to crack them.

An obvious example is the Galaxy S ICS disaster - the Galaxy S hardware is entirely able to support ICS and will almost certainly be supported by CM, but Samsung simply don't want to frontport their integrator customizations to Android 4.0 for that device.<p>Google could certainly introduce rules surrounding upgrades and integrator customizations which would alleviate the upgrade issue - CyanogenMod is proof of it.

How do you guys cope with stress?\nI have this guy calling me every day, asking about his project, which is kinda big and I am not even halfway through, and the other guy calling me consistently to upload his website on the server, and the server guys who remind me everyday to pay for it, and another guy on my dayjob who asks me to come up with projects for students to take on some competition. I also have 3 groups of students who have different projects which need to get done, I am just procrastinating that. And there is another guy who offered me a nice job overseas, and I just realized that my passport got expired, so I need to renew it in order to leave the country.<p>I mean, the solution might be pretty straightforward, just get the freaking job done! But its kinda hard in a way I can't explain. All I know is that I hate my phone, and I hate daylight. Anyone have any suggestions guys?

3401137,comment,3400508,3400979,6,0,electromagnetic,,,"> People got fat at the same time flipflops and cheesy t-shirts became suitable public attire. Pure coincidence?<p>Yes, as before the 1950's it was common to see the working class wearing 'waist overalls' (AKA baggy jeans) and wife beaters in public. It was after the 1950's that they became a staple in teen culture and spread to the middle class as those teens matured.<p>I don't see how there's a difference between cheesy t-shirts and wearing a wife beater (technically underwear) in public. I actually think t-shirts are more acceptable, despite wife beaters being a staple, like jeans, in the working class back before the 1900's. They became acceptable footwear in the post-war period when soldiers returned from Japan with them.<p>Note that Japan has had sandals as a cultural staple for centuries, to the point that they invented the tabi(?) AKA toe socks to be worn with them (because, you know inventing real shoes that keep your feet warm was just an absurd notion). So despite being commonly regarded as thin compared to westerners, I suppose they've become grossly obese by their own standards since they invented the sandal.<p>It's quite frankly absurd logic. I might as well say that Americans are fatter than Brits because it's acceptable to wear a lounge suit to formal events, whilst in the UK its less acceptable and generally only a full tux is regarded as fitting formal wear.<p>Sorry, the reason Americans have the fattest arses in the world is because its government gives massive subsidies to corn growers. Corn incidentally is a great source of calories and low source of nutrients. This means poor people have to consume larger amounts of food to get the same nutrition. This means they tend to get obese, because despite eating copious amounts of calories, they're still malnourished.<p>People get fat because of the abundance of cheap, low quality calories.<p>The most likely reason why South East Asians are healthier than westerners is because their government subsidizes higher nutritional quality foods. Rice for instance is a better start than corn. Similarly subsidizing salmon and tuna as opposed to cattle farm beef is again better.<p>I'm not saying beef is bad for you, but the shit in a McDonalds patty is, especially when you can get 1lb for like $2. The stuff you're paying $15 a lb for is likely not as bad as the vegans would want you to believe.",1325102669

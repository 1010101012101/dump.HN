898530,comment,897424,897832,0,0,almost,,,"Let bindings create a new local scope. It's only in the GHCi prompt that they apply ""from this point on"".<p>It is possible to do a more global redefinition but as far as I know you'd have to suppress the Standard Prelude which would mean you wouldn't really be in Haskell 98 anymore. It's certainly not something that would happen in a normal software project.<p>So to answer your question: In Haskell the effect is contained to a lexical scope (a few lines usually) where as in C++ it infects absolutely everything.",1256294540

Which value is ""correct""?</i><p>The one that actually results in a deal happening, which often means the highest amount on offer. The more standardized a good is and the more it's traded, the more well-defined its price is. If deals don't happen, there's no market-clearing price, e.g. no way to price sex with Mother Theresa.<p><i>Before you jump in with some clever aggregation function, suppose that the owners want to sell said house. Will they agree to the value that your aggregation function produces?</i><p>Yes they will, by my definition above :-)",1256294218

898526,comment,898486,898486,0,0,rythie,,,"It seems like there is a basic problem here. Users have spent years using WYSIWYG editors like MS Word, Email apps and so on. Having a basic text box breaks that. Not only that, it's different markup on every site you go to. User don't want to relearn the basics, especially not for each site.<p>Lack of richtext editor support in browsers has been the problem so far - but I believe mostly there with contentEditable support in all browsers?",1256293927

Jeff should be the first one who is familiar with the ""eye movement hotspot"" study that we see over and over again. Users rarely notice anything along the Right Hand Border (most web ads show up here). All user attention is focused on the top left edge, left margin and the top few lines. If you want to catch the user's eye this region is your best bet.<p>Move the formatting suggestions just below where your ""Title"" is placed and you will see a higher uptake - guaranteed. Blaming Users for Poor UI design smacks of unwarranted arrogance - never a desirable trait.",1256292765

Now you may think this is silly as why don't I just buy a lower data cap. The problem is I live with people with whom it is very hard to enforce any sane usage policy on. We go over our cap regularly. Now if I could ""outsource"" the enforcement to the ISP that would be different.",1256292698

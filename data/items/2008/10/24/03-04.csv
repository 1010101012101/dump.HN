342020,story,,,2,2,makecheck,"Rather insidious...Flash ""cookies""",,"If your browser has a Flash plug-in, it is capable of storing cookies that are not at all obvious.<p>I'm fairly security-minded (as I use OmniWeb's many features for filtering out the stuff I don't want), but this one I missed.  And it really bothers me, because:<p>1. Nowhere in the contextual menu for Flash content is there any way to reach the interface for managing cookies (e.g. deleting them).  For this, you have to go to a web page:<p><pre><code>    http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html\n</code></pre>\n2. The menu <i>does</i> have a ""Settings"" item, which displays many tabs of Flash player settings.  This conspicuously <i>does</i> look like a complete set of controls, yet it omits cookie controls completely.  In other words, if you think this shows everything the player can do, it doesn't.<p>3. Although you can finally delete the cookies from the web site, I saw no ""don't ever store cookies in the first place"" option.  So I basically have to keep going in and removing them.  (You can limit storage per-domain, but this is hardly a solution as many come from domains you'd never expect.)<p>This is insidious, Flash is not being forthcoming about what it is capable of doing.  Those of you on HN who are normally protective of other forms of cookies, what are your thoughts?",1224819613

Whether you want to block all tweets containing spoilers for your favorite TV show, or if you temporarily want to mute a drunk co-worker, twalala gives you that power.  (We also added a whitelist, so things like mentions of your name can always get through.)<p>AFAIAC, the big wins were (a) working with a team of friends that I hadn't had the chance to collaborate with before, and (b) building something that we all wanted to exist... and now that it does exists, we all use it every day.

342008,comment,341043,341983,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I won't argue with that logic.  It's the same market change that has led to Mac making a comeback, and Linux making a (small) move into the consumer desktop space, in ways that simply couldn't have happened in the 90's.  If apps continue to move to the web, the key will be who has the best browsing experience--and right now, it's roughly tied, IMHO (and they're based on the same rendering engine, so that makes sense).  This also explains why Windows Mobile has had so little impact--in all fairness, it ought to simply rule the roost (and it does have good raw numbers, but I don't think it has much mindshare)--the browser in Windows Mobile sucks dramatically worse than even IE on the desktop.  The same can be said for Palm and the Symbian devices that I've seen.  A smart phone with a crap browser is just a big ugly phone with some extra fancy crap bolted on.<p>It'll be interesting to see how cost, and other ancillary features (like GPS, to name just one) will effect buyers decisions.  Fashion (as in, ""who makes the prettiest accessory for my wardrobe?"") may, in fact, rule the day...in which case, Apple still has the upper hand, and, if PC history is any indicator, they will hang on to the upper hand for years to come.  Even today, it's pretty much impossible to buy a PC that looks as nice as an Apple (Dell has made a few effective moves in the area, and HP and Sony also seem interested in good design).  Then again, PCs still outsell Macs many times over, both in lappies and desktops.<p>So, maybe you're right, and the market will shake out dramatically differently than the PC market.  But, I'd sure hate to bet against history repeating itself given the wide array of similarities (many of the players are even the same, and they do appear to have the same playbooks).",1224817764

342006,comment,341830,341830,0,0,kwamenum86,,,"Sounds like this is a little bit more heavyweight than MIDI.  MIDI uses simple events and relatively simple representations of sound to play back compositions.  A MIDI file contains no sounds- it is more like a sheet of music.  You can play this file using an instrument you choose.<p>The compression they speak of is really just a more efficient storage of data.  Memory that was once used to encode raw sound data is now used to encode information about sound dynamics- totally different from MIDI.<p>I would like to know how large the libraries are though.  Seems like they could easily take up a lot of space.  Still a very useful technology though if they can perfect it.  Can you imagine what streaming music would be like?",1224817678

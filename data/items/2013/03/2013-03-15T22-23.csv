When G+ killed Google Reader's ""sharebro"" social network, Google Reader still was the best feed reader of the market by a long shot. Just like now, there was nowhere to run. Heck, I kept using it, just like anyone complaining. I kept recommending it because it was GReader or a fucking magazine-layout shitty app.<p>But now they are definetely killing it, and it will affect the users in a different way. They are trashing away the app so there's no way a user can simply adapt. Before you could say ""well, at least I can keep reading the feeds"". Now you got nothing.<p>About influencers, well, there are lots of people with a good chunk of influence using GReader. They might make a dent on how people perceive Google's app reliability. Even a small one could end up in some financial loss. If it would be significant to them, only time will tell.<p>By the way, have you noticed that the Google+ still didn't catch up? What if it's Google Reader users fault? Think about it.",1363388334

A lot of 24 year olds do not have such aspirations.  So just aspiring to something is helpful.<p>""I seriously struggle with motivation to do just about anything. I have a midterm tomorrow in Dynamics (a mech engr course), and I have pretty much neglected the class entirely, and I am most certainly going to fail it, and I'll have to withdraw. This isn't surprising, because I've been in this situation many, many times before.""<p>You were discussing how you think people on HN are smart.  I think people on HN are limited.  Not only do I think that, I am right, people on HN are limited.  Including myself.  Gnothi seauton.  Know your limitations.  Why do even the best coders say people shouldn't put more than, say, seven objects or variables in a function?  The truth is, many functions would be better with a couple of dozen variables in them.  Why do the best coders not do this?  Because they are limited.  They can only keep seven or eight objects in their head at once, they can't keep track of two hundred objects in their head at once.  So they write code that their limited brains can understand.  Bad coders write long functions with hundreds of variables, to where they can't keep the whole function in their head any more, and their code fails.  Good coders write functions that their tiny 1.5kg, 1 cubic decimeter brains can handle.<p>You said you know you're going to fail the course you mention.  Did you know before you started you would?  I don't know the answer, but it seems like you did, or you should have.  So why take the course?  Why set yourself up to fail?  You talk about motivation - nothing is more DE-motivating than setting yourself up to fail like that.  Or trying to get that great Apple job you're not yet qualified for.<p>Just like big code has to be ""broken up"" into small functions, you have to ""break up"" your big goals.  Set small, realistic, achievable goals and go from step to step.  If you can't achieve these new goals, then obviously they're not small, realistic and/or achievable enough, so make them smaller, more realistic and more achievale.<p>Nothing is more demotivating than this cycle of ""going for the gold"" and failing every time.  Things go incremently.  There are setbacks, maybe small, achievable, realistic goal #4 will have some setback.  So just deal with it and go on.  If you can only concentrate for five minutes, your goal should be to concentrate for five minutes and thirty seconds.  And go from there.  Iterative and incremental are popular philosophies here.",1363388268

We help in the analysis process because most tools fall short here.<p>For example, supposed you add more weapons to promote more battles in an online game to keep players engaged. Say, in addition, you start collecting measurements about how long battles take. Suddenly, after introducing the feature, the opposite happens: players leave.<p>Most off-the-shelf AB tools will only tell you whether feature A or feature B worked (the ""what""), but not the ""why."" It could be that battles are taking longer, so players lose interest without finishing. Or, more battles cause players to die/lose more, so they leave.<p>We let you ask questions in SQL that will resolve this and find out why. So, you can fix the problem, rather than be left in the dark. You might introduce a feature to shorten battles, or find a way so players don't die so often.<p>Sophisticated online gaming companies invest in complicated data infrastructure and experts to let you ask those questions (Hadoop, data warehouses, etc.).

Ante, at 538. This judicial remediation of executive default is unheard of. The role of habeas corpus is to determine the legality of executive detention, not to supply the omitted process necessary to make it legal. See Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 484 (1973) (""[T]he essence of habeas corpus is an attack by a person in custody upon the legality of that custody, and ... the traditional function of the writ is to secure release from illegal custody""); 1 Blackstone 132-133.

They are a programmatic way to specify what a ""host"" or group of ""hosts"" should look like using a dependency graph.  Basically it builds the dependency graph and works from the root to the leaves one level at a time.<p>As an example let's say you want to install MongoDB on a new Ubuntu machine, you have the following dependencies in approximate order;<p>* Add MongoDB Apt Repo to apt list.
* Add MongoDB repository key.
* apt-get update.
* apt-get install mongodb.
* Configure /etc/mongodb.conf to your liking.
* Restart mongodb.<p>Depending on how you implement it CM will allow you to make the process cookie cutter.<p>Want a new test environment? Spin one up and run your CM against the servers.
Want to try that hot new cloud provider? Ditto.<p>I think it's worth the investment unless you're just doing apps that have a very short shelf life (e.g. marketing apps that live for no longer than a few months).<p>Kind Regards,

Seems to work fine in just about every country that's tried it (which is most of the first world). Mind you, it's not really the health outcome that's guaranteed (obviously that's going to depend on individual constitution, age and lifestyle) but access to the same level of care is seen as a given. In my town recently there was a minor scandal when a pro hockey player showed up with a game injury at a local emergency ward and went to the head of the line. The hospital had to scramble to explain that his injury went through normal triage.<p>You talk about bankrupting the public, but clearly it's the far more expensive US system that is bankrupting the public (along with providing worse outcomes overall).

5383303,comment,5382279,5382833,2,0,halhen,,,"> how do you do it?<p>In Capital volume 1, Marx paints the following logical progression. Whether it carries any historical truth, I don't know. (Note: there are many more nuances to it, and you perhaps need to wrestle the original source to get it all)<p>To establish a single unit of measurement:<p>a. The simple, isolated, or accidental form of value: Commodities are exchangeable with other commodities, e.g. 20 yards of linen = 1 coat.<p>b. The Total or Expanded Form of Value: a commodity is exchangeable with any other commodity, e.g. 20 yards of linen = 1 coat or = 10 lb tea or = 40 lb coffee or = 1 quarter of corn or = 2 ounces of gold or = etc.<p>c. The general form of value: Any of said quantities of commodities are exchangeable with the original commodity, e.g. 1 coat, 10 lb tea, 40 lb coffee, 1 quarter of corn, and 2 ounces of gold, are worth 20 yards of linen.<p>d. The money form: One, or a few, commodities become either the de factor or the legal ""universal equivalent"" commodity in which exchange-value is measured. This universal requires some properties (I'm sure I have forgotten several):<p>* It must be uniform. Not all horses are equal, so horses are no good.<p>* It must be divisible and capable of quantitative differentiation. Half a work horse is less worth than half of a whole, and two halves of work horses does not equal one. Horses are not good for a second reason.<p>* As trade expands geographically, the value of the universal equivalent needs to be universally recognized. Horses for seamen? More inconvenient than it should be.<p>* The universal equivalent should not deteriorate. Horses die. They really are no good for this.<p>Instead, precious metals fulfill these qualities. And just as we use dollars and cents, gold and silver can be used to differentiate between different magnitudes of value. (Note: gold and silver still has values as commodities, which determine the amount of stuff you get for them. See the initial points.)<p>Still, they do have some problems. They require measurements and tools to divide. It's not really convenient to go into Starbucks with a lump of silver to carve the price for a coffee.<p>So coins are minted, containing the proper amount of each metal. New problems arise. Cheaters carve metals from the coins to melt and create new. Wear and tear cheapens the coins. So bills and coins are created as symbols of silver and gold, but backed by them. The actual precious metal reside elsewhere, and the bill is just a proof of ownership.<p>Now, those countries and owners who control precious metals get significant power. They can withhold or flood the marked at their whim. No good, says the other countries. So when currency is sufficiently recognized as a means of payment, one can remove the actual backing and keep the bills and coins only. And while we're on it, why bother with the bills at all? A balance in a computer is just as good, right?",1363385374

a) that it doesn't discriminate between domains with a lot of traffic and domains with a lot of spammy traffic (though, again, that's just speculation and maybe they do have that data), and

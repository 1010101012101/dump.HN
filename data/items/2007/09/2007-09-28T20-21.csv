Changing society may or may not result.<p>People give away money either to feel good about themselves or to help accomplish a goal.  <p>If a rich person's goal is ""to change society"", and a startup's goal is ""to get rich"", then the rich person will only invest in startups that will change society in the ways the rich person wants it to change.  Which is what happens already.<p>But if a rich person's goal is ""to get richer"", then they'll invest in startups that they think have a decent chance in getting rich, regardless of whether or not they change society.<p>Therefore, the current system actually invests in <i>more</i> startups than your system.<p>So what are you proposing?<p>I guess a more direct answer to your question is:  Nobody.",1191013133

We had 14 people at the house, and we all guessed how many eggs were in the jar.  The closest guess was off by about 8%, and the worst were more than 50% off.  As a little test of the wisdom of our crowd, we averaged the guesses.  Their average was 3% off the right answer.",1191011615

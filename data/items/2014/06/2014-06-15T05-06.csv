7894529,comment,7892745,7894258,10,0,Gabriel439,,,"If you want to familiarize yourself more with my `mvc` and `foldl` library, you can find the blog posts describing them here:<p><a href=""http://www.haskellforall.com/2014/04/model-view-controller-haskell-style.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskellforall.com/2014/04/model-view-controller-h...</a><p><a href=""http://www.haskellforall.com/2013/08/composable-streaming-folds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskellforall.com/2013/08/composable-streaming-fo...</a><p>It might seem like too much abstraction until you realize that the alternative would be the following obtuse type:<p><pre><code>    data Updatable a = forall x y . Updatable (forall r . ((x, x -> y -> x, x -> a, STM (Maybe y)) -> IO r) -> IO r))\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s what you get if you completely expand out the implementation of `Updatable`.  This is why I build up these abstractions from smaller composable pieces (i.e. `Fold` and `Managed` and `Controller`), each of which is intrinsically useful in isolation.<p>However, I think if you are trying to understand how `Managed` and `Controller` and `Fold` work all in one go, you&#x27;re going about it the wrong way.  Haskell lends itself really well to abstracting over the implementation by specifying mathematical equations inspired by category theory that the implementation obeys.  This is not the fake kind of abstraction that other languages promise but never actually deliver (i.e. abstractions that leak and forces you to read source code, often times several layers deep).  Rather, everything you need to know about the abstraction layer immediately underneath you is completely summarized by a succinct set of equations that you can then use to prove a new set of equations for the immediately following layer.  This post gives an example of this layered proof process:<p><a href=""http://www.haskellforall.com/2013/12/equational-reasoning.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskellforall.com/2013/12/equational-reasoning.ht...</a><p>By composing these small, correct-by-construction layers of equations you can grow to arbitrary complexity while always preserving correctness.  More importantly, you never need to reason about more than a single layer at a time since you&#x27;ve decoupled each layer&#x27;s correctness proofs from each other.  Contrast this with other languages where you often have to reason simultaneously over many layers of abstractions to debug difficult issues or prove correctness.<p>To answer the meat of your question, all you really need to know to understand how `Updatable` works is that:<p>* `Fold e` is an `Applicative`, for all `e`<p>* `Managed (Controller e)` is a `Monoid`, for all `e`<p>* `onLeft` and `onRight` are `Applicative` homomorphisms (this detail is noted in the library source code but I omitted it from the blog post)<p>Those four properties concisely summarize everything you need to know about every abstraction underneath `Updatable`.  If you approach this correctly, there is no need to dig into their source code further to understand how they work.  Truthfully, I would <i>love</i> if you were to dig into their source code to learn how they work, but if you really want to level up as a programmer then you need to start thinking more abstractly, layer-by-layer, instead of trying to fit the entire programming stack into your head all at once.",1402811359

Getting it had a cost: the time and effort to develop it.  He could either take on that whole cost himself up front, and try to recover it from other users when the program was finished, or he could share the cost with other users starting from an earlier stage by starting an open source project.<p>If you&#x27;re primarily concerned with having the program completed, why take the first path?  The second path seems like it will bring you to that goal more quickly and for less time, effort, and risk.  It just makes more sense.<p>And even if you&#x27;re primarily concerned with making money, the second path can still make more sense.  Using funding mechanisms like Kickstarter, you can be paid to write  software that you release under an open source license -- and since your backers commit to payment up front, before you write the code, you don&#x27;t have to take on the risk that no one buys a license for the completed program.

One of the projects I&#x27;ve been wanting to work on but haven&#x27;t gotten around to is about this system.  As the article mentions, OJ 287 is strange because it is a blazar (which is very rare, since the outflow has to be pointed directly at us) and is in a binary (which  is also rare), yet it also happens to be the largest black hole known in the universe!  So one could say that there&#x27;s a low prior for such a system to exist.<p>The reason that OJ 287 has to be so massive in this model is because the orbit of the secondary black hole precesses so rapidly.  For GR to give you that precession rate, you need a very, very massive black hole.<p>An alternative model I would like to explore is a three-body model for OJ 287.  If this black hole binary is orbited by a tertiary black hole, the tertiary can also induce precession in the inner binary, so OJ 287 would not need to be so massive, which would make the triple model more plausible.  It&#x27;s unclear yet whether the triple dynamics can reproduce the observed lightcurve of OJ 287, though, so this is just an idea that&#x27;s been on my to-do list for a year now.

Whether or not Namecoin works depends on whether or not Bitcoin works. They are the same exact technology (they&#x27;re just used for different purposes).<p>From what I could tell of Dan Kaminsky&#x27;s comments, I believe his arguments boil down to the well known 51% attack. Two things of note here:<p>1. See Dan&#x27;s 2013 post on businessinsider where he appears to be retracting his words: &quot;I Tried Hacking Bitcoin And I Failed&quot; <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/dan-kaminsky-highlights-flaws-bitcoin-2013-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.businessinsider.com/dan-kaminsky-highlights-flaws...</a><p>2. The 51% attack is still a real threat. The Bitcoin community is on it:<p><pre><code>    Proof of blockchain fair sharing is a draft Bitcoin protocol change\n    proposal by Iain Stewart, with the goal of allowing the network to\n    continue to settle on a sensible consensus blockchain even when\n    subject to a considerably- greater-than-50% attack.\n    \n    The protocol is under construction. The following description is a\n    &quot;teaser&quot;, establishing its basic flavour and sketching how it exploits\n    an asymmetry in the goals of the honest (<50%) and malicious (>50%)\n    miners to avoid the usual reductio ad absurdum argument against any\n    protocol surviving a >50% attack.\n</code></pre>\nFrom: <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_blockchain_fair_sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_blockchain_fair_sharing</a><p>Re: <i>&quot;I&#x27;d suggest rewriting this paper and removing all the political justification for why one might want such a system. Everyone gets that, but not everyone wants a system like this for the same reasons anyway.&quot;</i><p>Given the well popularized &quot;debate&quot; on this topic, I think it&#x27;s quite clear that everyone <i>does not</i> get that.<p><i>it doesn&#x27;t add much to the system.</i><p>It adds:<p>- The ability for JS apps to talk to and retrieve info from the blockchain <i>without a browser extension</i> (this wasn&#x27;t possible before. It&#x27;s a significant thing IMO).<p>- A new meta-domain (.nmc) and corresponding RESTful API for manipulating the blockchain<p>- DNSNMC may also support DNSCrypt (so that adds secure queries too).<p>- A gateway for browsers and other software to verify SSL certs without having to run a local namecoind client. (Which means you don&#x27;t need to pay for them anymore!)<p>Probably other useful stuff I&#x27;m forgetting at the moment. Perhaps others might chime in.

6964193,comment,6963365,6963365,1,0,notastartup,,,"searching 2pac lyrics rap genius yields no rapgenius.com either. it shows all the competitor lyric sites but not rapgenius.<p>I have mixed feelings about this. How long until we see a game of he-said-she-said? Of course, socially engineered link building aimed at gaming the SERP is against the interest of consumers and google. However, now that we can see a competitor get taken out from google SERP by pointing their attention to a malicious technique, we should see more stories like this.<p>The problem I have with SERP is that while it&#x27;s good at finding the most relevant site (still returns spammy sites so not perfect) most of the time, it&#x27;s built around the advertisement model. It doesn&#x27;t give you a snapshot of the cross section of the data you are looking at across all the domains out there so that you can&#x27;t choose on your own which lyric is the most to your liking (it really doesn&#x27;t matter because lyrics are same across different websites). So the question of who ranks first even though they have identical content shows some underlying inefficiencies caused by the Advertisement revenue model. The more there is, the more advertisement gets seen and clicked.<p>I feel that the search engine space with selling our attention to advertisements only creates more waste by others trying to get a share of the revenue by jumping into a profitable niche by creating an identical or similar content (article spinning etc). In turn, more competition would create people to use more Adwords or other advertising platforms. The end result is that consumer ends up with untrustworthy websites with content in the back of their priorities. Content should be judged by comparing it with other websites that offer the same content with an overview listing all the different domains showing that content. While displaying such cross domain contents, it should not bring advertisement as an incentive model.",1388004553

6964178,comment,6963755,6964076,7,0,wsxcde,,,"I think you&#x27;re mistaken. Tax evasion is rampant because enforcement is hard. Salaried people are taxed at source, so there isn&#x27;t too much evasion there. Similarly your big retail chains don&#x27;t evade VAT because they&#x27;re easy pickings for the tax authorities. Non-salaried people, small-time business persons etc. evade tax because there isn&#x27;t really a paper trail of their earnings, and also because complying with tax laws is a massive pain in terms of effort and bookkeeping. In the rural areas, nobody even bothers because it&#x27;s simply not worth the effort.<p>> <i>To which I say, perhaps the main reason for rampant scams and bribery is that taxes are evaded and these public employees are paid poorly.</i><p>Not really. India is a poor country and public employees are paid well-above the median income. Even the lowest level of public employees - sweepers, janitors and the like make more than 2.5X the median income. [1] And bureaucrats who are worth bribing get well more than that. Corruption in India and most other developing countries is a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma  type of situation. Each individual benefits from being corrupt and there is significant improvement in quality of life if you earn $1200 a month instead of $900 month. So they choose to be corrupt and this is more or less a rational decision. It isn&#x27;t an easy problem to solve, especially in the current world order with restrictive immigration practices.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://latestjobsingovt.com/freshers/peon-watchmensweeper-jobs-in-karnataka/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://latestjobsingovt.com/freshers/peon-watchmensweeper-jo...</a>",1388004248

That is, their works may certainly be formulaic, but at least it&#x27;s their own formula.<p>So what I meant by the comparison with pop music is, the criticism is not just that the same artist puts out albums that sound like their previous ones, but rather that all artists start to sound like each other. And that is what I fear may happen with &quot;pop lit&quot;: in the quest to appeal to as wide an audience as possible, all authors may end up sounding like each other.",1388004015

It’s impossible to keep track of all of them, so you must use approximations, and the approximate versions are too difficult, so you must approximate the approximations, until you get a theory that is simple enough to do the calculations and still it give the correct answer to your problems.<p>For example, if air is not trapped, then it’s almost incompressible when the speed is < 0,9 the sound speed (perhaps the approximation is good even for 0.99). I.e. for most of the calculations approximating that air is incompressible gives almost the correct result, unless you are very close to the sound speed. Incompressible fluids are lot easier to use in the calculations. (In particular, an incompressible 2D fluid can be modeled with complex analysis, it’s a beautiful approximation.) .So you are happier to get an almost correct result, with a lot less of computations and technical problems.<p>From the Wikipedia article:<p>> <i>The Prandtl-Glauert transformation is found by linearizing the potential equations associated with compressible, inviscid flow.</i><p>This formula is a good approximation for slow air flux. If you try to apply this to almost Mach 1 problems, you void the guaranty.<p><i></i>* Light speed Barrier<p>You can combine Special Relativity, Electromagnetism and Quantum Mechanics (well you need a Nobel price to do that :) ) and get one of the most precise Physics Theories. It can be tested with simple systems like a single electron bouncing against a single electron, so you don’t have to make too many approximations. (The equipment is very complex and the calculations are awful, but that’s another kind of approximations.) One of the more precise results is the magnetic moment of a electron. It depends heavily Special Relativity, Electromagnetism and Quantum Mechanics. The theoretical result and the experimental result agree with more than 10 significative figures <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalous_magnetic_dipole_moment\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalous_magnetic_dipole_momen...</a>. For all practical propose they are equal. The complete calculation involve also the week and strong force, but the theories that model them don’t change Special Relativity.<p>All the experiments in the LHC use very fast particles and to calculate their properties you must use a lot of corrections of Special Relativity. So the theory is already tested for particles with a speed very close to light speed. It’s very improbable that there will be possible to break the light barrier.<p>Another problem is that by Special Relativity, if you travel faster than light, someone with the right speed will see you traveling backward in time, and you open a Pandora box of paradox. There are some additional problems with gravity and General Relativity, but they don’t change the main points.<p>Every Physic Theory be proven wrong by an experiment, so it’s not possible to say that we will never have to modify Special Relativity to allow faster than light travel, but it is very improbable.",1388002873

As used today DNS is 1) A distributed key-value storage system 2) Incredibly scalable and fault-tolerant and 3) a de-facto internet routing layer for CDNs and GSLB endpoints. Namecoin systems typically provide (1) but overlook (2) and (3), which makes it hard to consider them as viable replacements.<p>I think it&#x27;s interesting to look at what existing entities do when faced with DNS MITM and takedowns. The various torrent searchers and anti-censorship entities just diversified the TLDs they depend upon. So when their &quot;.com&quot; or &quot;.net&quot; domain gets taken down or man-in-the-middled, they tell their users to shift to .is , .ch, .se or some other TLD with a different regulatory framework, thus avoiding a single point of failure.<p>If a new mechanism depends on the inconvenience of a browser extension anyway, why not automate the process people already use? For example &quot;colmmacc.multi&quot; could be intercepted by an extension and translated into 5 DNS requests against say SHA-2(&quot;colmmacc&quot;).[com|ch|ly|se|is] and the extension could use a simple majority quorum of the answers to defend against a tampered response. Of course it means you have to register and host your domain 5 times, but that&#x27;s pretty cheap these days.<p>Other nice properties: works with all existing DNS security mechanisms (including DNSSEC or DNScurve), provides security against registrar or registry level tampering or compromises. Hash of the domain makes it hard for registries to block domains (they have no idea what the name is until it is popular) and also resets the clock on squatters.",1388002261

One likely outcome is that it will result in a wave of &quot;pop literature&quot;. As I understand it, pop music is already heavily customized to appeal to the masses based on tracking loads of data, going as far as analyzing past hits to identify the combinations of tunes, vocals, instruments and audio effects that work best to create new hits. Record labels and producers apparently have it down to a (data) science.<p>Some may point out that mass-produced &quot;pop literature&quot; is not really new: for instance, the entire Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew series was just that. However, since this is not a widespread practice so far, (almost) nobody has complained about it.<p>But once this data starts getting used more and more, and feedback loops get more efficient, eventually pop literature may suffer from the same criticisms as pop music. In a way it&#x27;s good: you&#x27;re giving the customers what they want. But it also has the downside that creators will shape themselves to their audiences rather than express themselves freely, limiting the variety and individuality of creative output. As long as enough creators choose the latter at least once in a while, I think it&#x27;s a worthwhile tradeoff.<p>However, this is just the low-hanging fruit and does not explore the full potential of e-readers. E-readers need not just be dumb terminals that phone home with reader behavior -- they&#x27;re fully capable general-purpose computers, and we should use them as such! We should be thinking of e-readers that &quot;adapt&quot; to the reader and the material. And not just an &quot;average reader&quot; profiled aggregately over an entire audience, but individual readers. Let the authors freely express themselves, and let technology bridge the gap between the creative work and the reader.<p>I haven&#x27;t thought it through completely, but we certainly have the technology -- things like NLP and machine learning and user profiling and heuristics can go a long way in performing basic adaptive tasks. User likes short chapters but the book has long ones? Re-segment the text to match the user&#x27;s preferences! (Maybe using a variant of text tiling.) User looking for new reads? Recommend books based on similarity of reading behaviors! They could even change the language based on user profiles. User too young? Tone down the profanity! User too old? Replace &quot;really whips the llamma&#x27;s ass&quot; with &quot;totally funkadelic&quot;!<p>Technology is, of course, not advanced enough, so we would still rely on human input to a great extent. Editorial staff (or other readers) would need to provide tons of annotations and metadata that can help e-readers adapt better.<p>But eventually it may happen that for the same material two users may end up having very different reading experiences.",1388002105

If its #1, I doubt we&#x27;ll see a clear explanation.  If its #2, somebody may have to fall on the sword as the &quot;poster child&quot; of bad business decisions.",1388001913

That is a very strange \n    feature of the quantum/classical dichotomy of the \n    Copenhagen interpretation, and it leaves one very basic \n    question completely open: There is no way to predict \n    quantum physically when the quantum measurement \n    process and the collapse of the quantum state will take place, \n    or even to find out the time distribution of the measurement \n    process in a statistical way. The Copenhagen interpretation \n    only defines the statistical distribution of the possible \n    measurement results assuming a measurement is being \n    performed at a given time, but doesn’t tell anything about the \n    conditions under which a quantum measurement will actually \n    happen – basically because measuring is considered as an act \n    taking place in the classical world, which escapes quantum \n    physical description.[2]\n</code></pre>\n[0]: &quot;You and I&quot;.

It&#x27;s hardly their fault they are the best at search. If someone comes along with something better people will use that. on the interwebs there&#x27;s no such thing as brand loyalty. Going forward the internet&#x27;s biggest problem is security. With hackers pulling millions of credit cards from Target and seldom a day goes by without reading about some big corp getting hacked, people will more and more look to big corporations like google that can hire the best security minds for their online protection. Using google gives you some degree of trust that the sites in the results are there for a reason, people they aren&#x27;t scams or bogus companies. Google is the internet&#x27;s filter, and in this case with RG I am not sure that i don&#x27;t side with google. There are plenty of alternatives to RG. I don&#x27;t see why anyone would care much about song lyrics, but it&#x27;s not like RG are the only game in town.",1388001754

It was money well spent, even if some of the companies that used the scheme, especially the multi-nationals, abused the system somewhat.t still brought jobs to the Celtic fringes, and lowered the pressure on the London pressure cooker.<p>Something like that scheme is needed on a permanent basis.

86736,comment,86506,86556,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Dunno about that.  One of my former teachers is over there now setting up schools (and doing some management consulting on the side - he's a former startup founder), and he said that it's very different than the charter school I went to.  China's educational system is great for the 1% that makes it into a top university, but they really don't care about the 99% that don't, and there are few opportunities available for them.<p>His information is current (as of last year), but as part of the ""establishment"", he might be unaware of an underground subculture, so it doesn't necessarily contradict your cousin's experience.  As far as the official system is concerned, though, it's still a vicious meritocracy with few opportunities for niche players.",1196967962

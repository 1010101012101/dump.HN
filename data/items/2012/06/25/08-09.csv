4155695,comment,4154421,4154421,5,0,viraptor,,,"The greatest thing I remember from winamp was the visualisation plugin. It was a high performance graphics processor really. You could draw a couple of lines oscilloscope-style (plot based on volume in each band), throw in some blur, surface transformation, etc. and you could get amazing 3d-looking ""textured"" models moving around. It was an amazing framework for playing around with generated graphics. There were some great authors too who could make really nice visualisations effortlessly (or at least it looked like that) - I saw a ""rendered"" insides of menger sponge done in just a couple of lines of Dynamic Distance Modifier layer. Mind-blowing experience trying to figure out how it worked (like watching demo scene stuff).<p>I remember actually that once AVS got keyboard control, we tried to use it for a presentation in maths class. That's right - a music visualiser was easier to use for some high-school guys than other frameworks to do a 3d graphics presentation!",1340614694

I'm not saying it's not possible - and quite honestly, I don't know much about Civ4 to call this - but I know from when I was in the depths of a Counter-Strike ""career"" that people with a below-surface-level appreciation of a particular game can absorb educational value from them and from their experiences whilst playing.

Scala on the other hand is more consistent, elegant and simpler. That's why it has ""<i>case classes</i>"", because case classes are used for algebraic data-types, which have special properties that aren't necessarily shared by normal classes.<p>And because of implicits, the type-system is also more powerful than what's available in Ocaml and even Haskell. It's arguably too powerful, but the things that the collections library can do have no match in other languages. E.g. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/1728140/3280"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/1728140/3280</a><p>I also liked to bitch and moan about the lack of real type inferencing in Scala, however in Ocaml and Haskell just because the types are not specified, that doesn't mean you can ignore those types. Quite the contrary, you always have to be aware of those types, as opposed to working in a dynamic language.

At 34 with a year's experience at a tech start-up, you are not going to get hired when there are people at 34 with 14 years experience at tech start-ups. It's not just a job for some people, it's an obsession, and that is why they get hired. If you want to work in tech, you have to focus on it, stick with it. The people with little experience show it in their sub-standard work. I don't care how good you think you are, you are still going to make the same mistakes everyone else made at your experience level. Companies who want to succeed want experience. Stick with it, freelance and intern if you have to, but you need to start building a portfolio, a track record.

3085347,comment,3083410,3084940,2,0,Chris_Newton,,,"> Safari on iPhone uses that definition (that's the whole ""resolution doubling"" thing, in a nutshell).<p>That's my point, though: no-one is really implementing CSS-px. What they're doing is implementing approximations, like doubling everything up on a high-dpi screen because the pixel pitch is roughly twice what you get on a typical desktop monitor, which is close enough to be workable.<p>If browsers implemented CSS-px as specified, then on all the monitors in front of me, the text on most pages I have open right now would look the same size in Firefox, and not noticeably smaller on some monitors than others. Also, all those beautiful, crisp <i>n</i>-pixel borders on mobile-friendly sites would look terrible (because they would be rendered with different degrees of fuzziness due to the antialiasing on different mobile devices) and everyone's photographs on Facebook would be blurry. Of course, that's a silly idea, and no browser actually does it (other than when zooming).<p>Most of the major mobile browsers (possibly all by now) support restricting the viewport and zoom so you can match your site to real, physical screen properties instead of whatever virtual viewport size they pretend to have by default. IME, a fairly high proportion of mobile-specific and responsive pages now start by switching this on. No-one's going to change this functionality any time soon, because vast numbers of mobile-optimised sites would immediately break. Fortunately, that means we can go into real-physical-dimensions modes and then use media queries to select an appropriate layout (including text sizes) for smaller, high-dpi devices as part of a design, without sacrificing precision in cases where the time and money is there to work on the fine details for best results on that kind of device.",1318013543

3085323,comment,3082587,3082918,1,0,Natsu,,,"The patent rules are unfair.  You <i>can't</i> really protect yourself from infringement claims.  Using that comment as a reason for enhanced damages was quite harsh, given that all he said was that in the US, people sue a lot.<p>Let's review how you're supposed to avoid infringing on anyone's patents.  Maybe then it will be clear that you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.  If you read patents, any infringement is willful (you should've known).  If you don't read patents, you don't know what was out there and somebody will sue you with one of those method of doing business online type patents (they're not quite that generic, but they're damned close).  If you reinvent an idea that someone patented first, that doesn't qualify as proof of obviousness.  And there are groups of people buying up patents for the sole purpose of suing over them.<p>So even if you do your best to do nothing wrong, you can still get sued.  Big companies used to have a deterrent:  keep a huge portfolio and promise mutual destruction to any other large company that sues you.  Now, with the NPE model, it's turned into a free-for-all and billions of dollars are being wasted in lawsuits.",1318013193

I would assume the majority of current programmers are in a similar situation.<p>The draw of these other languages like Factor, Io, Erlang, Haskell, and the other is that they are different. Erlang focuses on concurrency in a way that is not seen in the common languages listed above. Haskell is strongly typed functional language with lazy evaluation (I think I have that right). I don't know where Factor and Io fit it. By learning these other languages, I would hope to learn different ways to solve problems or to think about things.

3085141,comment,3084283,3084679,2,0,farlington,,,"I don't know if I can answer your question, but I could maybe clarify what I think are a few misconceptions.<p>The first misconception is that artists are generally opposed to new revenue models. Artists, designers, craftspeople have absolutely embraced new revenue models, and the number of artists, graphic designers, fashion designers, video artists, industrial designers, et al. using sites like kickstarter and etsy, or selling digital work like templates or themes, is staggering. And many of these don't involve the 'typical exchange of work for money,' but are on one level or another creatively or professionally fulfilling.<p>The second is about the 'no spec' argument. There are huge differences between new revenue modelsthey're not all equal, and they're not all fair. Design professionals find spec work exploitative because they're exchanging their services to a client without any guarantee of payment. Most people in most industries find this unfair. Programmers are no exception. Nobody likes to do a lot of work for someone else to only earn a chance of getting paid.<p>Working for spec is fundamentally different from working for free for yourselfto design and manufacture a product, for example.<p>And as a sidenote, while few designers are comfortable with the proliferation of spec-driven websites, most designers I know don't feel particularly threatened by them anymore. At their best, they provide an outlet for students, unemployed, and self-taught designers to build their portfolios. But the work that comes out of them isn't generally great, and the clients that use them are generally the kind of clients nobody wants: fussy, demanding, unimaginative and cheap. Clients who probably wouldn't be paying for design services otherwise. It still costs money to get good work. That's what it's really about: protecting the value of the work you do professionally.",1318010919

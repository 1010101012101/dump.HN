What do we do now?</i><p>This is why advocating for technical defenses alone is doomed to fail. It&#x27;s great to employ as much technology as we can, but playing cat-and-mouse with our own government is a losing proposition. They are determined and have unlimited resources (read our money plus the printing press).<p>There needs to be much more pressing on the legal front, such that unwarranted breach of privacy is criminally punishable in very clear ways. If an individual is not the subject of an investigation, for which proper warrants have been obtained, then no records of any kind should be collected or maintained. Full-stop. And efforts to decrypt private communications, etc. should be considered criminal acts. All of this needs to be protected with very clear and robust whistle-blower laws.<p>Otherwise, thinking that we will deploy some tech to permanently stymie our government is fantasy. And over-focus on that aim tacitly cedes that our government is entitled to whatever it can crack.",1419817890

It&#x27;s pointless to say that Finland has a unified teacher preparation program, implying that other countries do not.  There are in fact uniform teacher training regimes in the USA that are comparable in scale to the one in Finland.  The New York City Department of Education has as many students as Finland has.  LAUSD isn&#x27;t much smaller.  So instead of asking what lessons we could learn from Finland, would it make as much sense to cherry-pick some successful school districts from within our own country and learn lessons from them?

I could either go and sign on and get my flat paid for or go to work.<p>&#x27;I chose to go to work and I paid all my debts off.&#x27;<p>....<p>[sic] &quot;I could sign on and get my flat paid for&quot;<p>The DM is known for right wing bias, but Winstone is known for left wing support, and you can make of the whole thing wherever you like, but the truth remains much the same today: you can go and sign on for benefits, and get your rent paid for. That&#x27;s a amazing thing, if your life falls through the cracks. But it is a way of life. I have had friends explain to me how they chose to &quot;go on the sick&quot;, one after a epileptic fit. That person does suffer epilepsy, or something similar, but the fits I witnessed coincided with being involved in a frightening relationship based as far as I could tell, on access to a boyfriend&#x27;s money to indulge a long term heroin habit. I&#x27;d in ten years not seen or known of a fit, before that abusive blow out, and meanwhile her habit had been paid for by renting out her provided home, at a discount to, but still substantial profit on, market rates, whilst she lived with her partner in squats. This is not a exceptional example.<p>We now have even fourth generation children of families who have never worked a regular job.<p>And a vast health service burdened in so many ways my head spins.<p>They took away the notion of self responsibility.<p>That, as far as I can see it, is my prognosis for the terminal decline that is wreaking havoc in every walk of life.<p>We call for education &quot;reform&quot;.<p>Reform usually means slow action, changing structures piecemeal or adjusting parameters in a technocratic ideal.<p>But, blinkers off, what took generations to rot, to completely decompose, may not be resuscitated if the conditions of good growth are poisoned soil.<p>Please forgive me my outpourings.<p>I lucked out in early life in so many ways.<p>And I screwed up big time, about a decade or so ago.<p>It&#x27;s taken ten years work, not nine to five or even hours I could count, but a wholesale reeducation of this once super privileged, highly educated, young man, to just begin to reclaim the advantages I had.<p>What hope, then, those who fell through the same gaps in life, which I did, who did not benefit from a unrivalled academic education? People think I boast, rest on laurels, when I mention my young years. BS. I am highlighting just how harsh this system is. And the safety net that is provided, amazing though it be on paper, is totally alien to people of comparable upbringing to me (distorted also by genuinely Georgian era parents) and I could surmise my experience as being that alienation is in fact a class distinction, highly archive in this (to parrot John Major)&quot; classless society&quot;. Rot. Class divisions have never been more acute. If Marx did not choke himself to death whilst reading our papers, he might laugh at the ridicule of social inversion, where now the lowest are elevated to national priorities, where the intelligence of the proletariat as worshipped by Tolstoy has become the fattened (on junk food), indigent (on &quot;benefits&quot; and &quot;entitlements&quot;)and uneducated (c.f. all the above)  idle class.<p>This was the reality, into which Tony Blair, and coterie, believes mass immigration would instill a work ethic and a hunger for self betterment. I and my friends often receive taunts, for being friends across race lines, in a majority immigrant, second to third gen, neighborhood. So I could care less for racialist nonsense. But consider the sheer scale of the solution that was promoted, to solve a problem that whilst occasionally identified, is still verboten speech in true debate.<p>As programmers, however many LOCs we debug a day, we should be gravely concerned as to the trivialization where supers, &quot;3M&quot; ideals, of twenty years ago are pocket sized stolen currency for hits of crack, and the technology is more seen as a vector against which state must protect children, or swoop in SWAT style upon admittedly amoral copyists of entertainment. The charade of the BBC, on the recent SONY hack, tells us all; a self proclaimed hacker was not interviewed but subjected to faux indignation, asked what right he had to spoil innocent childrens&#x27; appreciation of their new PS4s. We ought to be indignant instead at the presumption that technology exists for such trivial gratification. I guess anything which is potentially apolitical, is soon co-opted by political interests. But where is the promise of individual capability that once switched on and delivered a BASIC interpreter at a prompt? There&#x27;s progress, measured by landfills, but where is that promise? There is the political disaster of technology, as affects us all. I want to scream at adverts for employees, asking for skills in using Microsoft word. Not because word might actually need ability in macro scripting, but because I thought the necessity to specify elementary ability with computers should have died out by the time I was in my thirties. I guess, too, that much of life is a disappointment. Software became a pseudo- religious ground, arguably, and all systems close to money will fight within themselves. But lately it seems to me every website was reinventing the wheel of a basic text editor, and I started to cry a little, inside. Not least because perfection never came for a word processor. But because I don&#x27;t know in what direction this technology is going, not beyond the &quot;d&#x27;oh-horizon&quot; of jargon, the realization of the omits of monikers such as &quot;cloud computing&quot;, but more generally, I could not see a direction. The proverbial revolution seems to have come and gone without revolving much at all. But look now, and everything I see does amaze me, it&#x27;s wonderful. The riches make me cry. But they seem to make those who would rather attain riches without any work, cry the louder. I have never imagined there could be such a polarization of have and have not, for real, in my lifetime, growing Jo as I did, in the safe illusion of the late seventies, but I feral it now, and what we do, and no amount of web n.x hipsterism is changing this detrimental dynamic. One is only cool for so long, and the cooling cycle is on better than web time, beyond nay hope that politicians, or those involved, might ever catch up, let along &quot;get with&quot; any program.<p>If I go on, i&#x27;ll be searching for New Year&#x27;s Resolutions, so i&#x27;ll just beg once again forgiveness for my personal outflowing of worry, and say a little prayer that there&#x27;s the ingenuity to find solutions that are not mere rehashes or inversions of the same old problems.",1419817253

I think that&#x27;s okay, but I do want to suggest that perhaps you aren&#x27;t ardently for free speech as many of the items in the list appear to make some sense to you.<p>I&#x27;m of a similar mindset but don&#x27;t hold such extreme views.<p>Allow me to try to provide some justification for the items you listed.<p>The types of pornography that are made illegal (here we are talking about America, you would get my agreement about recent laws passed in the UK) are snuff films - rape and child pornography or pornography that permanently disables or disfigures the subject - because they do necessarily hurt the subject. Once the pictures/videos are already taken, they continue to hurt the victims as their suffering is publicized and available to the fantasy of clients (and of course they won&#x27;t see any proceeds), and this media will hurt future victims by institutionalizing a demand for new content. Limits on pornography (despite what religion institutions yell loudly about) are not about harm to customers but harm to subjects.<p>With exceptions for torture, humiliation, dismemberment and execution (including the same to animals) I won&#x27;t defend obscenity restrictions as the arguments are quite different than those for restricted forms of pornography. These listed exceptions of course are great examples of harm coming from obscene content and again are illegal (though lacking in the case of animals) under obscenity laws under the harm principle.<p>Other forms of obscenity restrictions seem to me to fall directly in line with the offense principle and should not be restricted. Take for example the Supreme Court decision Miller v. California. The resulting &#x27;Miller Test&#x27; for obscenity decisions:<p>1. Whether the average person would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to a lewd curiosity;<p>2. Whether the work depicts or describes, in an offensive way, sexual conduct or excretory functions, specifically defined by applicable state law; and<p>3. Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.<p>Compare this test against Mill:<p>&quot;That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear <i>because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise, or even right</i>... The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.&quot;<p>Obscenity, when it is victimless, and it is almost always victimless, clearly fails the harm principle test. For the most part, this is the case in America. There are cases where obscenity laws prevent things such as expressions of homosexual affection, for example, and it is harder to find clear victimhood in these cases even when the law agrees to prohibit them. A note that this Supreme Court decision was made by a conservative majority court.<p>Regarding sedition I understand your point - that speech critical of the power elite ought to be protected in the strongest terms. I have a lot to say with regard to restrictions on sedition. I&#x27;ll advocate for a devil for a blurb and then comment briefly in an attempt to sum up more than I can defend into a few sentences.<p>With very few exceptions (the velvet revolution?), successful seditious overthrow of a ruling class and/or government have in almost every single case caused great harm both to the ruling class and to those who are caught adrift in the following power vacuum. Furthermore the ruling class/governance structure <i>have</i> to be convinced that alternatives to their administration is harmful. Other mechanisms for change are (supposed to be) available in Western democracies so that seditious change is not necessary, as the JFK quote &quot;those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.&quot; One additional item - I can&#x27;t actually find (in America) a modern use of sedition laws, though I merely performed an internet search.<p>Summing more than I can defend into a few sentences: presumably if a government were harming its citizens (the power elite abusing their position) this is a prior wrong and in alignment with the JFK quote violent revolution is inevitable. Presumably at the point where seditious speech is required for freedom from government by implication the government is unjust and its laws - those restricting seditious speech and otherwise - hold no justifiable weight.<p>In short I agree with you very wholeheartedly regarding sedition.<p>Because this is getting long, and because your analysis for the final items occupy a similar space - allow me to respond to them in tandem.<p>You suggest in the final five (trade secrets, NDAs, public order, security and nuisance) that harm may in fact be done to specific individuals - those whose income relies on the keeping of certain secrets/formulas/processes, or those who occupy certain streets/neighborhoods/townships - but that additional harm can be done to other individuals (dissidents and political activists) by a state seeking to weaponize these laws and to abuse them. I would suggest here that the problem is not with the laws but with the abuse. Any law can be abused by the state to harass or detain critics. The worry here is that by targeting laws that protect the public security (&quot;fire!&quot;) one would throw the baby out with the bath water.",1419816447

You might as well ascribe it to destiny, divine will, the inexorable forward motion of the proletariat, etc. You&#x27;re essentially invoking a religious entity as the external embodiment of your own consumer desire...<p><i>You should be doing something like selling them hot dogs. If that is not sufficient revenue, try something else, like taking up a collection for your next project. But suppose that none of the many possible methods for raising capital work; then, maybe the time of large statues is over, and you’ll have to do something else with your efforts; something for which there is an audience willing to pay.</i><p>...and then adopting a hectoring moral tone to berate the producers of statues - the people who make the very thing you like to stare at - as if not one, but all previously obscure statues had suddenly been exposed by this &#x27;freak storm&#x27;. You want someone who has invested considerable time, skill, and material in creating a durable commodity to switch their efforts to also supplying you with a perishable one (which is a reflection of your consumer relationship with the film, as a temporary entertainment) in order to recoup their initial investment. Then you suggest they could try begging for money - which is workable in some contexts, but definitely <i>not</i> for anyone producing something new or for the first time; crowdfunding essentially surfs on someone else&#x27;s prior marketing investment but that&#x27;s hardly a viable strategy for the first time statue sculptor who&#x27;s trying to raise revenue without any sort of functioning residual model.<p>Then you conclude by suggesting that maybe the era of large statues is over, and they have no value. this is <i>obviously</i> false, because your metaphor depends upon people voluntarily investing their time in looking at said statues. Given the opportunity cost of that time at minimum wage, it&#x27;s clear that the aggregate value of the time spent on statue-gazing adds up to a significant sum; for each of the many viewers - and you&#x27;re the one who posited a large crowd of them - the utility of gazing upon the artwork clearly exceeds the marginal utility of more economically productive activity for the gazer. So you&#x27;re saying that producers of these highly attractive statues are entitled to the attention of the viewers (insofar as they are willing to spend time gazing upon the artwork) but <i>not one cent</i> of positive expenditure over and above that.<p><i>The very idea of intellectual “property” is extremely suspect in these days of zero-cost copying. “He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.”</i><p>But ideas are not copyrightable; expressions of them are. And by focusing on the extremely low marginal cost of copying, you are completely ignoring the enormous fixed cost of production. Films are a particular pain point because while they are quickly consumed (in the space of a few hours) they require enormous amount of time to produce (often measured in years) and a great deal of money.<p>So if we&#x27;re talking about, say, <i>The Matrix</i>, we can share the idea cheaply enough: &#x27;hey, have you ever considered that our actions, social roles, and our very identities are actually illusions fed to us by an inhuman mechanism which perpetuates itself by extraction of energy from our physical bodies? That our lives are actually no more meaningful than those of fish in an aquarium or battery hens in an egg farm, notwithstanding the apparent uniqueness of our subjective experience? Here, check out authors like Marx and Baudrillard and imagine what they would have made of the computer age.&#x27; Certainly, sharing of intellectual ideas has been a foundation of progress since ancient times.<p>But actual <i>movie</i> known as <i>The Matrix</i> took about 5 years and $60 million to produce. Now of course everyone who invested in the film has made their money back in that case, but that&#x27;s not relevant unless you adhere to an economic philosophy of price control and a planned distribution of wealth. Why should the people who invested the substantial labor and capital required to create such an elaborate work not enjoy a property interest in it? If you <i>do</i> think it&#x27;s because they have already recovered their investment and then some, doesn&#x27;t that mean that Mark Zuckerberg and everyone else with a significant stake in Facebook should have their holdings liquidated up to some substantial cash amount, and the firm and its codebase should all be open-sourced.<p>And what of films that have not yet become profitable, notwithstanding their significant cultural quality? Just the other day we had a longish thread about <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>, based on an article that observed it did quite poorly at release and only found an ensuring audience after it entered the secondary and tertiary distribution markets (home video and TV, in a nutshell). If that film were released today, it might still find an audience via file-sharing, but not the revenue to recoup its production and launch costs, meaning no residual income for the actors, director, or producers. Nor would it serve its ongoing function of cross-subsidizing other films of limited commercial success during their releases, some of which in turn may not yet have found their own audience.",1419815895

You can then spend a large amount of time and money developing and verifying your system.  The goals and constraints of your project will determine whether this is a good trade-off.  I&#x27;m certain that Java is preferable for writing the vast majority of web apps, but the web is not everything.<p>> If the tooling for verifying C is really so good, why not verify the C parts of the JRE?<p>First, I&#x27;m going to guess that an enormous amount of static and dynamic analysis has been done on the JRE.  Bugs in it are rather rare these days, given its size and complexity.<p>However, verification tools are generally not suited to this particular task.  Verification tools are better at verifying typical application code, and the JRE needs to do a lot of very unusual operations in order to work.  In cases where you&#x27;d use verification, you&#x27;d also typically use a &quot;safe&quot; subset of C.  Some of these subsets don&#x27;t even permit dynamic memory allocation, or if so, only permit it at program startup.<p>So, it may actually be more straightforward to deliver a working Mars rover in C than it would be to deliver a verified JRE.

I&#x27;m an absolute fanatic for Trello.<p>OneNote - The greatest program ever made. OneNote isn&#x27;t useful for short-term to-dos, but I couldn&#x27;t live without its organization of my long-term work.<p>Pocket - I never have time to read articles, and they&#x27;re unpleasant to read on a squat laptop screen in any case. Pocket lets me read them on my tablet, in the subway, with gorgeous formatting.<p>Google Calendar - The whole Google ecosystem is ridiculously useful for organization, including auto-additions to your calendar from Gmail and Google Now&#x27;s intelligent suggestions.<p>Gmail - Particularly the five-tab filtering. Holy shit. I had no idea how disorganized my inbox was before I could filter away the dreck.<p>Google Keep - It&#x27;s been displaced somewhat by Trello (in terms of grocery lists, etc.) but it&#x27;s still great for medium-length notes that you&#x27;d like to read on the subway or something. I store a huge amount of poetry in mine.<p>Google+ - The BEST place for photos. I don&#x27;t understand the fashionable hatred. G+ is by far the best photo backup/organizer/enhancer/sharer I&#x27;ve ever seen, and the G+ social network is WAY better than Facebook&#x27;s clunky organization. I&#x27;m amazed that Facebook is so bad with photos... isn&#x27;t that pretty essential for social networks? G+ is just too good to be ignored forever.<p>GDrive - Corollary to G+. Putting photos on GDrive automatically uploads them to G+, which again is just excellent. Google DEFINITELY needs to upgrade their 1TB limit to &quot;unlimited,&quot; though... and offer auto-deduplication for identical photos for the billions of us with redundant photo hoards. Right now, GDrive prices are the highest on the market for limited storage and no extra features like deduplication or auto-organization. I still pay for GDrive just for G+ photo features, but Dropbox offers equal/better functionality and OneDrive offers much better value.<p>Kindle - You never realize what a burden paper books are until you have an alternative. Ebooks are incredible.<p>Calibre - Especially if you have a ton of academic papers or studies to pore through, organizing them in Calibre makes life infinitely simpler.<p>Spotify - Outsourcing my music collection to streaming services is GREAT. I&#x27;m now trying out Google Music, which lets me upload 20,000 MP3s to supplement the holes in Google&#x27;s collection. (Perfect for unpublished songs and so on.)<p>Steam - The original Spotify for video games. All the same benefits, plus amazing sale prices that have forced me to buy way too large a collection.<p>edX - Coursera and Udacity also, but any of these are gold mines for organizing self-paced education.<p>Pidgin - Still the best instant messenger, though the shift toward closed networks is making it harder to use. That Google still allows Pidgin to access Hangouts via (limited) XMPP has kept me faithful. I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would use something like WhatsApp and its crappy clients.<p>- - - - -<p>If anyone from Google is reading this, particularly from the Tasks team... just buy Trello already. GTasks is woefully inadequate, particularly when compared against Trello&#x27;s unbelievably powerful kanban organization.<p>Also, I&#x27;m a little disturbed by how heavily I depend on Google. I don&#x27;t see any viable competitors, though -- Outlook lacks Gmail&#x27;s tabs and themes, OneDrive lacks GDrive&#x27;s functionality, Facebook lacks G+&#x27;s insane photo features, WhatsApp lacks open APIs. I hope Microsoft steps up soon, because I don&#x27;t see any other real competitors against Google dominance of web services.",1419815681
8808148,comment,8806740,8806740,0,0,kijin,,,"Why so impatient?<p>The Earth goes around the Sun, not the other way around. Copernicus realized this for the first time in the early 16th century. By the end of the 17th century, almost every scientist in Europe were convinced that Copernicus was right. Why? It was elegant (no epicycles) [1], it was politically exciting (it went against the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church and was therefore especially attrative to reformers), and some of its followers (ever heard of Isaac Newton?) had come up with really cool ideas.<p>In other words, heliocentrism in the late 17th century had all the features that a popular programming language today might have [2]. But as a scientific theory, it remained unconfirmed, and its rival (geocentrism) remained unfalsified, even as the world embraced heliocentrism as the One True Theory.<p>Conclusive falsification of geocentrism, and thus compelling confirmation of heliocentrism, only arrived in 1838 with the first observation of parallax. That was almost 300 years after Copernicus first advocated heliocentrism, and over 100 years after almost everyone accepted it. For all those decades and centuries, people had been believing in heliocentrism without having tested it.<p>The history of science is rife with examples like this. Some theories are inherently difficult to test, so it can take a few decades, or even centuries, to collect conclusive experimental evidence. Sometimes you have to wait for others to develop the technology you need, just as heliocentrism had to wait for highly accurate telescopes to measure parallax. Because it costs a lot to develop such technologies, a theory without a critical mass of highly motivated followers is at risk of fizzling out before it can ever be tested.<p>This is an inevitable consequence of the fact that science depends on a bunch of hairless bipedal monkeys for its existence. When falsification takes a long time, humans tend to be influenced by political, philosophical, aesthetic, and even religious factors. And this isn&#x27;t a Totally Evil Thing™, because if we weren&#x27;t influenced by such factors, much fewer theories would ever make it to falsification. They would just fizzle out for lack of motivation.<p>How long has string theory been around? 50 years? And we&#x27;re already being impatient with it? Remember how long we had to wait for Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution to become mainstream and well-supported by evidence? Remember how long it took for &quot;driftists&quot; (those who supported plate tectonics) and &quot;fixists&quot; (those who opposed it) to reach a consensus? 50 years is about as long as it takes to test a theory about the distant history of this planet using recent technology. How much longer do you think it will take to test a theory about the fundamental structure of the universe, when we can&#x27;t even imagine the kind of technology we&#x27;d need in order to start testin&#x27;?<p>Copernicus waited 300 years. String theorists should expect to wait 500-1000 years, if not more. And we, the rest of the society, should strive to support such long-term endeavors to the best of our abilities [3]. It&#x27;s not as if string theorists are asking us to build expensive underground facilities for them, right?<p>[1] The lack of epicycles was a particularly attractive feature because of the newly discovered moons of Jupiter. Too many levels of epicycles made the Ptolemaic model look rather inelegant.<p>[2] Elegant syntax, sexy community, and a cool standard library.<p>[3] That is, unless there&#x27;s something so obviously fishy about a theory that the consensus is that it&#x27;s not even worth trying to falsify. Intelligent design probably falls into this category.",1419815676

Or perhaps it does, and I failed to notice?<p>Most competing file formats seem to beat JPEG by only a slim margin, and what I&#x27;ve read on arithmetic encoding suggests it gives a ~5-10% gain, which would make that difference slimmer still, perhaps vanishing into the uncertainty of the usefulness of these quality benchmarks. Of course, there would be inertia to overcome to support it, as with a new format, but recompiling everyone&#x27;s libjpeg is surely less work than adding support for whole new file formats.

Those who point out severe economic inequality in the US are communists or socialists who hate America. Those who want a secular government which doesn&#x27;t favor one specific religion do so because they hate Jesus. And so on.<p>It&#x27;s very easy language to use. It implies the opposition is based in unthinking emotions so can be ignored. It&#x27;s also true that some may actually be driven by hatred or self-hatred; and for that matter be based in very logical reasoning.

Typical for that time, the mail server was sendmail with an unholy, gnarly config including SpamAssassin with an unholy, gnarly config. The guy handling sysadmin duties was out of his depth.

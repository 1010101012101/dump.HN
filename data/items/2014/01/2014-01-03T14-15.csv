My goal since I was 18 years old was to have 6 months pay in the bank and it wasn&#x27;t long before I had that.  Since my parents didn&#x27;t have two nickels to rub together though, I didn&#x27;t have much of a choice and absolutely no fall back if I got into trouble so this was kind of a necessity for me.<p>Also, I&#x27;m surprised that anyone in IT is afraid of losing their job.  Currently I work 40 hours per week at the investment bank I work at full time and 20+ hours per week doing side programming.

I recommend the paper &quot;Veri\fed by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode:\nor, How Not to Design Authentication&quot; by Steven Murdoch and Ross Anderson, who have been involved in quite a lot of the security research surrounding EMV.<p><a href""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/fc10vbvsecurecode.pd"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/fc10vbvsecurecode.pdf</a><p>EMV has it&#x27;s problems. I&#x27;ve worked with a few researchers who have targeted the security of it in several ways and found some quite serious issues, so I&#x27;m quite aware of the security implications. However in terms of practical criminal use, having the challenge and response mechanism with the card is a significant improvement over the static data of a magstripe.<p>That said, an interesting piece of British law is the fact that a signature forgery is never the responsibility of the victim. This means that if someone fraudulently signs for a payment, you are not responsible for the charges at all, whereas if someone watches you enter your PIN, or you tell it to someone and they subsequently use it to make payments, this is your responsibility. The grey area for a while was that the companies behind EMV said it was &#x27;uncrackable&#x27; (never a good idea) and refused to take responsibility of charges that some users claimed had been made without their PINs being revealed by them. Anderson, and the Cambridge security researchers demonstrated a proof of concept a few years ago that showed how it could be used without knowing disclosure of the PIN, and since then card companies and banks have been a little more receptive to taking on the responsibility.",1388761058

Over its <i>entire working lifetime</i>, the number of person-hours lost because of construction effects might still heavily outweigh the number of person-hours saved because of marginally reduced journey times.<p><i>&quot;the difference between a straight route rather than two curves on it resulting in adding 30 minutes to the traveling of every person that uses that route now, and in the centuries to come&quot;</i><p>I didn&#x27;t give that example because nothing we&#x27;re talking about for either Hyperloop or the UK-based rail network is anything close to adding 30 minutes to the journey time. You&#x27;re absurdly exaggerating the effects of rerouting. Maybe if you added numerous deviations to avoid numerous undesirable land conflicts you&#x27;d get to that kind of level, but in that case you have to balance it against numerous different sets of people who lose out in all those conflicts as well.<p>Basically, the idea of claiming large amounts of land where people are living right now to build infrastructure like the Hyperloop is about as blatant an elitist land-grab as I can think of. If it really were severely inconveniencing a handful of people to make life significantly better for millions you might at least have a decent argument, but the real numbers don&#x27;t appear to be anything like that from any of the Googling I&#x27;m doing today.",1388760940

7005669,comment,7001747,7005388,1,0,bollockitis,,,"> Energy balance is the physics of biochemistry; there is no arguing away the laws of thermodynamics. If you get heavier, it&#x27;s because you consumed more energy than you used over a period of time. There is no other way to gain or lose weight* (no matter the proportion of muscle/fat that&#x27;s gained or lost).<p>I&#x27;m not claiming that the body can somehow defy the laws of thermodynamics. Obviously to become &quot;heavier&quot; one must consume more energy than one expends, but to lose fat -- specifically fat, not muscle tissue or bone or water -- the question is this: how important is the role of hormones in fat regulation? Does an increased insulin load, coupled with insulin resistance caused by long-term exposure to chronically high insulin levels, promote greater fat storage? And does this greater mass of fat, which itself is a hormonally active organ, affect the body in a way that results in illness and further weight gain?<p>Would an endocrinologist tell a diabetic that macronutrient content doesn&#x27;t matter? Should we give that same advice to people with metabolic syndrome or those who are at risk of developing it? If insulin resistance is the primary cause of Type 2 Diabetes, and insulin is the primary hormone involved in fat storage -- both non-controversial statements -- then wouldn&#x27;t it make sense for those at risk of developing T2DM to eat foods that produced a minimal insulin response?<p>Read Taubes&#x27;s thought experiment I linked above. If you&#x27;re willing to make nutrition texts bedtime reading, then you will at least find it interesting, even if you disagree with it. Though Taubes is not a scientist and he doesn&#x27;t claim to be, he does make a compelling argument.<p>> Don&#x27;t pull out the &quot;a simple failure of willpower&quot; straw man; I never claimed that.<p>It wasn&#x27;t intended to target you specifically, but this attitude is pervasive, even among medical professionals. There are people out there who would much rather believe that every obese patient is just a lazy glutton who can&#x27;t control himself. I know a few of these people myself, one of whom is a prominent oncologist. Science requires that we put aside our biases and assumptions.<p>> Hormones play a HUGE role in metabolism. My bedtime reading is how the chemical reactions they drive fit into human metabolism. you&#x27;re comment seems to make them out to be &quot;magical&quot;, which I suspect is due to your ignorance of them.<p>I&#x27;m not claiming hormones are magical. I am merely suggesting that their known role in fat regulation might also play a critical role in obesity. It&#x27;s been a while since I studied the topic in any great depth, so I can&#x27;t compete with your bedtime reading, and I don&#x27;t want to link spam, so I&#x27;m keeping it simple.<p>Anyway, I believe the science will eventually shed some light on this issue. There are clinical trials in the planning stages right now, so hopefully we won&#x27;t have long to wait.",1388760832

The press release uses neither the word &quot;murine&quot; nor the word &quot;mouse,&quot; and mentions &quot;animal models&quot; in passing just once, so when I first read the press release, I wasn&#x27;t completely sure whether or not the findings were from a study of human patients. It will be important to check whether or not these findings translate into a safe and effective treatment for human patients after many more follow-up studies. As the authors note, pancreatic cancer is commonplace enough that an effective treatment for it would have a substantial good effect on human health.<p>Many, many submissions to HN are based at bottom on press releases, and press releases are well known for spinning preliminary research findings beyond all recognition. This has been commented on in the PhD comic &quot;The Science News Cycle,&quot;[2] which only exaggerates the process a very little. More serious commentary in the edited group blog post &quot;Related by coincidence only? University and medical journal press releases versus journal articles&quot;[3] points to the same danger of taking press releases (and news aggregator website articles based solely on press releases) too seriously. Press releases are usually misleading, promising more than the research result can be sure to deliver.<p>The most sure and certain finding of any preliminary study will be that more research is needed. All too often, preliminary findings don&#x27;t lead to further useful discoveries in science, because the preliminary findings are flawed. The obligatory link for any discussion of a report on a research result like the one kindly submitted here is the article &quot;Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation&quot;[4] by Peter Norvig, director of research at Google, on how to interpret scientific research.

My take on Big Data is 2 parts  1) Big Data is managing the large transactional, daily data of an organization.  I believe this is what most people relate to Big Data i.e. map reduce, BI, etc.  2)  Big Data is gathering bits of perceived dissimilar minutiae and finding meaningful information from it.  This is classical statistics, engineering, and machine learning.  The data itself may not be the scale of Amazon, Google or Facebook but it still computational intensive to develop algorithms for it.",1388758015

It is as possible to build a civilization from corn as it was from rice and wheat.<p>Oh also, this whole &quot;grains are bad for you because of our caveman roots&quot; thing has to be the least provable piece of speculation passing around the Internet these days. It is backed by few facts and much smugness.<p>I like to speculate too though. I think the problem with corn is the petroleum refining style approach that is taken with it. If you read up about it corn is treated as almost like a chemical feedstock. The resulting &quot;products&quot; are a public health disaster hidden from scrutiny by the money of Archer Daniels Midland etc and politicians from the Corn Belt.<p>The problem with wheat is the post WWII intensive breeding programs designed to maximize yield and gluten content. Gluten makes a easier feedstock for bakers and food product manufacturers. It also counts towards protein measurements and that directly relates to price. Many governments like Saudi Arabia that buy wheat for their entire nation look for higher protein levels and bumping gluten is a nice shortcut. I believe these market driven wheat modifications have produced unexamined changes and proteins that negatively affect the health of a significant percentage of the population. I believe in the coming years we will see a movement promoting the revival of &quot;heritage&quot; strains of wheat like <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Fife_whea"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Fife_wheat</a>.",1388757681

Now I am not a neuroscientist or anything closer to that field, so it is just a hunch. To me, it always seemed odd that such a large community of scientists never questioned that. In other words, there is sort of a tacit assumption that if we see it on fMRI and thi s region is lit up then the brain causes this.<p>Or say ""we noticed this part of the brained is bulging out and that is related to the person being left handled, therefore left-handedness comes from a physiological basis"".<p>In the most elementary discussions of scientific principle the causation vs correlation always comes up as a basic fallacy yet in the case of brain and behavior this view seems rather absent.

4514179,comment,4514087,4514157,1,0,jmtame,,,"Thanks! The idea was started out of the desire to make travel itineraries easy. For example, my girlfriend and I made a list of things we wanted to do when we went to London. It was a lot of work to comb through all the various travel sites, but we still built an itinerary together.<p>I think most people will share the same basic group of tourist locations (eg the food markets, major art galleries, etc) but they'll want to do other things uniquely interesting to them. So it'd be easy to fork a basic ""London tour guide"" list and then add your own couple of items there. I think it'd be more interesting to look over other people's lists rather than search through a bunch of web sites with ads.<p>Another idea I've had is that I go shopping through the produce section of Safeway all the time (I live in Sunnyvale, and that move-in list on the home page is real).

4514134,comment,4511188,4511188,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"A cultural problem with depression is that it's very poorly understood, but a lot of people feel qualified to have an opinion about it. (People don't claim to be experts on other diseases, but a lot of people have pet theories on depression.) Yes, getting more exercise and sleeping better will help a lot of people clear out the mild, annoying but usually not life-threatening, depression that normal people get if they get sloppy. People with actual, <i>bona fide</i> clinical depression need medical treatment, however. (If you're sleeping 18 hours per day and brutally lethargic for the other six, it's hard to get physical exercise in the first place, and getting to the grocery store to buy fruit is an ordeal. Think of depression as like a really bad flu that last weeks and you won't be far off.) They aren't ""weak"" in any moral sense; they're weakened by a horrible, largely physical, disease.<p>You run into the same thing if you talk about panic, because a lot of people think of the low-level anxiety attacks that everyone gets, not the intense kind that literally feel like you're drowning in air.<p>I think the problem is that our society (especially in white-collar workplaces) measures people based on a war of attrition. Most companies intentionally create unnecessary stress and promote the last people standing after the rest develop mental illnesses (usually the mild, situational kind) that cause them to be unable to perform. The losing competitors are the ones who experience stress-related, career-rupturing anxiety or depression. (Sometimes this is called ""nervous breakdown"", but I fucking hate that phrase.) The winners are the ones left over, who are taken to have ""proven their loyalty"" by out-surviving the rest. This is absurd given that, if a company's running well, it should never see anything remotely like the rightward tail of the decline curve. But this is how the corporate ladder game has been run for decades.<p>A lot of people won't admit this, but they feel the same way about therapy and mood-regulating medications that they do about doping in sports. They're indignant that ""the weak"" aren't dropping off as quick as they'd like, and that normal people have to compete harder as a result because the people who used to drop off around 30-35 hours per day can now go to the standard 40-50 or more. This is pure speculation, but I've often thought that the emergence of good anti-anxiety drugs and anti-depressants has been a contributing factor to the increasing hours expected in white-collar work (not to say that these drugs are bad-- they aren't, they're lifesaving-- or that people who need them shouldn't use them-- they should) as well as the increasing prevalence of open-plan office layouts where open-back visibility is the norm. Before benzodiazepines, the economics didn't favor open-back visibility. Now, they might. (I still think open-back visibility is a disaster. Not everyone can afford individual offices, but have some decency.)<p>What makes us unusual in the ""hacker"" community is that most of us tend to have volatile and steep curves. Under decent conditions where human creativity is at the maximum, we're the top performers. Under pressure-cooker conditions that push people well along the decline curve, we're among the first to fail.<p>What's changing (in our favor) is economics. Pareto distributions (80-20 laws) can be cruel in terms of the inequality they represent, but those winner-take-all contests (which cause inequality in macroscopic business success, but we never get too tied to a business unless we're founders) are <i>good</i> for us as mercenary programmers. Upper-tier creativity and engineering talent are now <i>worth something</i>.

4514133,comment,4511188,4511188,17,0,michaelochurch,,,"A cultural problem with depression is that it's very poorly understood, but a lot of people feel qualified to have an opinion about it. (People don't claim to be experts on other diseases, but a lot of people have pet theories on depression.) Yes, getting more exercise and sleeping better will help a lot of people clear out the mild, annoying but usually not life-threatening, depression that normal people get if they get sloppy. People with actual, <i>bona fide</i> clinical depression need medical treatment, however. (If you're sleeping 18 hours per day and brutally lethargic for the other six, it's hard to get physical exercise in the first place, and getting to the grocery store to buy fruit is an ordeal. Think of depression as like a really bad flu that last weeks and you won't be far off.) They aren't ""weak"" in any moral sense; they're weakened by a horrible, largely physical, disease.<p>You run into the same thing if you talk about panic, because a lot of people think of the low-level anxiety attacks that everyone gets, not the intense kind that literally feel like you're drowning in air.<p>I think the problem is that our society (especially in white-collar workplaces) measures people based on a war of attrition. Most companies intentionally create unnecessary stress and promote the last people standing after the rest develop mental illnesses (usually the mild, situational kind) that cause them to be unable to perform. The losing competitors are the ones who experience stress-related, career-rupturing anxiety or depression. (Sometimes this is called ""nervous breakdown"", but I fucking hate that phrase.) The winners are the ones left over, who are taken to have ""proven their loyalty"" by out-surviving the rest. This is absurd given that, if a company's running well, it should never see anything remotely like the rightward tail of the decline curve. But this is how the corporate ladder game has been run for decades.<p>A lot of people won't admit this, but they feel the same way about therapy and mood-regulating medications that they do about doping in sports. They're indignant that ""the weak"" aren't dropping off as quick as they'd like, and that normal people have to compete harder as a result because the people who used to drop off around 30-35 hours per day can now go to the standard 40-50 or more. This is pure speculation, but I've often thought that the emergence of good anti-anxiety drugs and anti-depressants has been a contributing factor to the increasing hours expected in white-collar work (not to say that these drugs are bad-- they aren't, they're lifesaving-- or that people who need them shouldn't use them-- they should) as well as the increasing prevalence of open-plan office layouts where open-back visibility is the norm. Before benzodiazepines, the economics didn't favor open-back visibility. Now, they might. (I still think open-back visibility is a disaster. Not everyone can afford individual offices, but have some decency.)<p>What makes us unusual in the ""hacker"" community is that most of us tend to have volatile and steep curves. Under decent conditions where human creativity is at the maximum, we're the top performers. Under pressure-cooker conditions that push people well along the decline curve, we're among the first to fail.<p>What's changing (in our favor) is economics. Pareto distributions (80-20 laws) can be cruel in terms of the inequality they represent, but those winner-take-all contests (which cause inequality in macroscopic business success, but we never get too tied to a business unless we're founders) are <i>good</i> for us as mercenary programmers. Upper-tier creativity and engineering talent are now <i>worth something</i>. We can sell our skills, finally, for what they're worth.<p>In the old-style corporate world, work was intellectually easy and tedious, even at executive levels.

Maybe someday if Mozilla and Google agree on a standard app format....<p>As I said above, though, this appears to be the only actually viable solution at this point.

4514001,comment,4513696,4513696,4,0,kimmiller,,,"I like to think about this criticism in the context of Twitter's recent API pullback and push towards advertising.<p>When a start-up raises at a valuation that is high, most assume current owners win and new owners lose. Yet I contend that everyone loses.<p>Setting a val that is too high means the profits needed to achieve a decent return are sky high. More importantly they are different from the early investors/founders.<p>How much of Twitter's recent strategy is being driven by their multi-million dollar investors (at multi-billion vals) wanting clarity on an exit plan? These guys put large quantums of money in and are pushing hard for dollars back. IMHO, they'll tank the company - all because they raised too much at too higher val.<p>At the end of the day it's best to have everyone in the company (post-deal) feeling like they got a good deal. Kinda like a partner/wife - you never want to feel like you're the one that's trading down in the relationship.<p>Same can happen at seed.<p>Disclosure: I invested in a YC company this round.",1347494717
4514000,comment,4513838,4513838,23,0,slapshot,,,"Kudos for breaking the mold and I love the design from a ""this is new and fun"" perspective, but I completely disagree from a functional perspective.  It looks really neat (if a little over-testosteroned), but if I'm visiting the police's web page then I might want to do one of the following (there are plenty more, these are just an example):<p><pre><code>  - Find the non-emergency number for the police;\n  - Report a crime;\n  - Find my car that has been towed;\n  - Pay a fine, citation, traffic ticket, etc;\n  - Find the nearest police station (to get fingerprints, etc);\n  - Apply for a job;\n  - View a map or statistics about crime.\n</code></pre>\nTo do any of those, I have to start at the picture of cops, scroll all the way to the bottom of the page (past lots of press releases), click on ""about"" and then start navigating.  Or notice the tiny box on the far right side of the screen, click ""about"" (why click ""about"" if I want to find my car? I dunno), then start navigating.  Some of these links are also in a PDF [1] just in case I haven't gotten my ""Acrobat Reader wants to update itself"" message for the day.<p>I'd say this is at least 25% less functional than some other (probably much cheaper) very plain sites I've seen for similarly-sized cities. [2]<p>In other words: if you aren't in the business of user experience, think twice before presenting a novel user experience.  The business of police should be policing, not looking cool online.  There is a zero chance that a technophobe would be likely to solve their problems using this site, thus increasing the burden on (already depleted) staff at stations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.milwaukeepolicenews.com/wp-content/themes/milwaukeepolice/MPD-FAQs.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.milwaukeepolicenews.com/wp-content/themes/milwauk...</a><p>[2] E.g., <a href=""http://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/police/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/police/</a>",1347494663

On the other hand there have always been huge climatic changes in the history of earth, so we can't just count on everything staying the same it always was. It didn't work for the dinosaurs, that much is certain. There is no benevolent force that sees to keeping conditions just right for human survival. <p>As for CO2, I also don't know why suddenly all attention is focussed on that. It seems to be just one part of the problem/puzzle.",1192445635

67982,comment,67826,67836,0,0,earthboundkid,,,"I think one thing that might help is if the choice was a little less binary. A one to five star rating system might help sort out the difference between ""a decent way to kill some time at work, so up vote"" (3 stars) and ""something that will actually change the way that I look at the world, so up vote"" (5 stars). Something to think about.",1192444708

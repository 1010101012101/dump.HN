It is trivial to set up a ruby command line on any OS and then have a .gemfile in your version control to ensure that everyone is using the same version of sass. Then all that is required to generate the css files from the sass sources is opening up a command prompt with ruby and typing `compass watch`. It&#x27;s worth it for the time saved writing css.<p>> Nope but it&#x27;s a real problem. Some of our guys don&#x27;t do the web.<p>Is it not also a problem that you have people writing your css who &quot;don&#x27;t do the web&quot;?

Torrent swarms and bitcoin are two examples of such distributed systems and making an easy way to prototype more would help us replace more and more centralized systems with distributed ones.",1384365546

6726991,comment,6725096,6726437,3,0,wirrbel,,,"I have attended a talk by Gtz Werner, who advocates for a  basic income. In this talk he was basically describing basic income as a reform of the tax system. Basically G.W. argues for most taxes to be abolished in favour of a significant increase in VAT (Value added tax).<p>He had several arguments for this. One is, that at the moment in Germany, labor is taxed, so there is an incentive to move production to overseas. A VAT is applied to goods from abroad and from the same country fairly.<p>The basic income would then be a negative tax refund to compensate for the social problems that a high VAT causes (since poor people suffer under high VAT more than rich people).<p>So let us say a person spends 1000 EUR on VAT-relevant purchases (food, clothes, phone, etc.). Now a VAT is introduced, so the products now cost 2000 EUR. Then a basic income of 1000 EUR would annihilate the additional burden. Another person spending 2000 EUR a month at the moment would soon have to spend 4000 EUR, 1000 EUR being provided by the basic income, therefore this person would have to spend 3000 EUR (1000 EUR increase) to buy the same goods as before. Because other taxes would be abolished, the income would be higher. Furthermore, with VAT there would be less tax loopholes and tax collection would be a lot easier.<p>As a _second_ idea, this basic income could be chosen to be above the level necessary to compensate for the VAT. This is the idea which is in generally associated with the basic income and outlined in the model.<p>I will take a look at the model more closely. I find this approach really interesting.",1384365449
6726990,comment,6724292,6726899,13,0,tptacek,,,"Why?!<p>The <i>entire reason</i> people think TLS should have &quot;unauthenticated encryption&quot; (which is in the literature kind of an oxymoron) is that they don&#x27;t like the SSL CAs.<p>I don&#x27;t like them either.<p>But the SSL CAs are a UI issue. Instead of dinking around with the browser UI to make worthless &quot;unauthenticated encryption&quot; sessions appear different, why not just build a UI for TACK, let people sign their own certificates if they want, but then pin them in browsers so those sites can rely on key continuity instead of nothing.<p>Five years from now, if TACK pinning becomes the norm, I think it&#x27;s a safe prediction that basic TLS certificates will be free from multiple vendors. Moreover, the corruption of the CA system will matter less, because unauthorized certificates will violate pins and be detected; the CAs that issue them can be evicted.<p>While we&#x27;re at it, why don&#x27;t we just fix the UI for managing CA roots? It hasn&#x27;t changed since the mid-1990s.<p>I am baffled by why anyone would actively promote an insecure cryptosystem as a cure for UI problems, or even as an alternative for some entirely new cryptosystem like MinimaLT.",1384365441

6726986,comment,6725096,6725989,4,0,KGZotU,,,"Right, there are several people arguing here against the entire project of naive modeling. The author&#x27;s response is that you can criticise, but only in the form of providing a competing naive model.<p>From the post:<p>> If you disagree with these numbers or this distribution, there is no need for you to stop reading. Just download the code and change the numbers. Your change in these assumptions might completely invalidate my conclusions, or they might not matter at all. The best way to find out is to actually run the model.<p>Varying parameters and producing different predictions would not invalidate the model. What validates or invalidates a model is whether or not it actually predicts the behavior you&#x27;re trying to model. Without a validity test, modeling is pure sophistry.<p>So instead of suggesting another naive model, let me suggest a way to augment the whole project: construct a model that successfully predicts actual, ongoing, real world behavior. Test your model against actual, real world policy changes. If it has verified predictive power, then you have some base to claim that it can predict novel policy changes.<p>Any given person&#x27;s opinion may condense decades of personal experience. I disagree with the author&#x27;s claim that (even naive) mathematical modeling is better than personal opinion. Given any rigorous definition of <i>better</i>, that is frankly an empirical claim that the author has left unsupported.",1384365411

6726938,comment,6726689,6726689,2,0,IanDrake,,,">What are your experiences with Phonegap?<p>I started very early in PhoneGap.  Keeping up with the changes as the product has matured has been a pain, but expected.  You&#x27;ll be glad it&#x27;s pretty mature at this point.<p>That said, starting with v3.0 the move to NPM has taken development reliability back a few steps in my opinion.  I like the new command line interface, I just wish it worked more consistently.  I&#x27;m sure it will get better.<p>>Is it generally permissibe for making enterprise mobile applications?<p>That&#x27;s what I use it for.  It works well for this purpose.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it for B2C apps though, especially for Android because the browser on Android performs poorly, especially for scrolling - very laggy and spastic.<p>>What features could be missing?<p>There are a lot of plugins that fill in the gaps.  I don&#x27;t recall not being able to do something a native app could do.  I&#x27;ve used, the GPS, photo gallery, camera, enabled &quot;Open In&quot;, FileTransfer, media recording, and probably a few other plugins.<p>>Why doesn&#x27;t everyone use Phonegap if it can deploy to multiple platforms?<p>Because there are other platforms that could be used.  If C# is your thing, you could check out <a href=""http://xamarin.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xamarin.com</a>  With that you could write apps in a MVVM style and reuse your ViewModels in a PCL that could be reused across Windows Phone, Android, and iOS.<p>The thing is, mobile apps are now typically an extension of a web app, so if you already have web developers then PhoneGap gets you there faster.  The end result will be a good product, but will never be a truly great product.",1384365090

Not that it doesn&#x27;t happen, but it usually requires the employee to ask for it.<p>One of the big issues, which I presume they expect this plan to help resolve, is how do you pre-judge a prospective employee&#x27;s value?  The employee wants a maximal initial grant, and the employer typically wants a minimal grant.  The more they favor the grant desire of the employee, the longer the vesting period becomes - such that the employer is able to cut their losses if the employee doesn&#x27;t pan out.<p>Simply knowing that if you leave, some other guy that comes after you is going to get your 1% entices you to stay around long after your usefulness has ended.  Either way, the company is already out of their 1%, but now they have an additional payroll drag.  Much better to accept the 1% if you&#x27;re going to give it, and be done with it.<p>I&#x27;m also unaware of what the sourcing is by the article&#x27;s author, wherein lies this huge problem that non-employees hold a bunch of stock in a company is making it difficult for companies to grow into their full potential.  To be fair, if a company takes outside investment, it typically gives more stock to non-employees than employees, additionally giving them preferred upside and rights the employees as common stock option holders do not have.  Again, if they feel the outside investors have much better aligned interests with the company than the current employees, they have a different problem than option grants.",1384365047

But it&#x27;s also a step toward a temporary lack of security as the organizations catch up.  It&#x27;s because the security industry is a trailing industry (by definition) - you can&#x27;t build a product that fixes security issues until you know: a) what the issues are, and b) how to fix them.<p>So, for a while, the early adopters of HTTP/2 are going to fly without a net somewhat.<p>(FYI - this same set of discussion points applies to IPv6 adoption)",1384365006

Likewise, if the pool is a certain size, there might be some resentment if the company hires more people and reduces equity for everybody else.<p>- What is preventing the company from simply adding more people to this coveted pool once one leaves, reducing the advantages the first few had?",1384364557

The predicted outcomes still greatly favor Basic Job to the tune of ~1.5T.<p>I think that this demonstrates to a large degree the author&#x27;s point that the best way to disagree is to make a change and see what you come up with. For someone with inclinations similar to yours, your comment is likely enough for them to justify dismissing the result reached by the basic model, but when you add the proposed effect to the model, well, you come to the same basic conclusion, that Basic Income is significantly more expensive than Basic Job.<p>A lot of comments here, including yours, come from an unjustified implicit rejection of the main thesis of the article by preferring rhetoric over model refinement. That is, the author is arguing that a better way to go about this discourse is to test the effects of different assumptions with the model, but many commenters are hammering through rhetorical rebuttals to the model&#x27;s conclusion without addressing whether they actually believe that rhetoric is more effective than the mode of discourse proposed by the author.<p>Your rhetorical argument (including the argument of the grandparent since you apparently concurred: &quot;absolutely&quot;) suggests that the main factor in deciding between the two approaches is whether they decrease or increase work productivity. When that hypothesis is tested in the model, it turns out that the other factors combined overwhelm the effect on worker productivity, and so the effect on worker productivity should not dominate the debate as suggested by the grandparent.<p>This was an easily testable hypothesis given the model offered, and once it was tested it looked weaker than suggested by the grandparent. I think that this demonstrates that there is some truth to the author&#x27;s claim that running our assumptions through the model, and refining it overtime is likely more valuable than making these untested rhetorical arguments.<p>Now, certainly there are likely problems elsewhere in the model, and reasonable people can have disagreements on what assumptions are reasonable. But the point is to argue and test those assumptions continually, rather than offering unweighted rhetorical arguments and either never reaching consensus, or just landing on the argument that is most repeated or shouted the most loudly.",1384363878

As such, the employees which benefit the company the most during the early phases, and whose skills are most aligned to those phases will not be fairly rewarded if they make the (IMO, correct) decision to leave the company to make room for the right people at those later stages.<p>The assumption here seems to be that the primary value of an employee is their future effort, not their past.  While there are certainly problems with poor employees leaving with some options vested, I fail to see this as an endemic issue where tons of bad employees are leaving companies one day after the initial vesting cliff (which should only result in the first tranche of options, not their full amount).  If you have a big problem with this - I&#x27;d say the problem is not the vesting of stock options, but your failure to accurately create the right ISO plan and the failure to accurately identify which employees are likely to leave before you&#x27;ve attained the value you need from them.",1384363268

You didn&#x27;t take their 3xxx/4xxx follow-ups that the math and CS (different courses, same idea) took. At Georgia Tech, CMPEs took 2130 Languages and Translation. The course <i>introduced</i> compilers, it <i>introduced</i> language hierarchies (regular, context-free, etc.), but the 3xxx or 4xxx CS theory and compilers courses were where the material was <i>really</i> taught. And CMPEs rarely took those courses. If they did they were seeking a second major (no minor in CS was offered at the time, IIRC).<p>The same is true in math. EE/CMPE, probably every E, took through differential equations, maybe another math course or two, but few took number theory, numerical analysis, real analysis, the 4xxx stats or 4xxx linear algebra courses.<p>The <i>depth</i> at the undergraduate level between what an engineering major gets from the other departments (math, physics, cs) is nowhere near the depth that those majoring in those programs will see (depending on school, I&#x27;ll grant some schools may not have strong science or math programs beyond the core engineering majors need).",1384363183
6726660,comment,6725387,6726203,5,0,thewarrior,,,"Well I&#x27;m a javascript noob myself but I&#x27;ll try to explain. The clever thing is how he used eval.<p>This is where the magic happens :<p><pre><code>  var getter = function() {

          var value = localStorage[elm.id] || &quot;&quot;;

          if (value.charAt(0) == &quot;=&quot;) {

              with (DATA) return eval(value.substring(1));

          } else { return isNaN(parseFloat(value)) ? value :

  parseFloat(value); }

     };
</code></pre>
So if  you entered &quot;=A1 + A2&quot; it would be evaluated as 
DATA[A1]+DATA[A2] . A1 and A2 get bound to DATA because of the preceding with statement.<p>Now the question is what happens when DATA[A1] is called.
He used Object.defineProperty to ensure that whenever you try to access a cell the same method (which i just explained) gets called.<p><pre><code>    Object.defineProperty(DATA, elm.id, {get:getter});
</code></pre>
This means add a property called elm.id to DATA and it&#x27;s getter is the function I just explained.<p>So whenever we try to acess DATA[something] it hooks into the same getter method so a cell can depend on another cell which depends on another cell and so on ..<p>Now you can see why this so clever. Because he used the inbuilt eval it can evaluate any kind of formula involving multiplication , division or function calls.<p>The only thing I dont understand is how circular references are prevented.<p>Like I said I&#x27;m not very familiar with JS so if anyone notices anything wrong I&#x27;d like to know.",1384363174

We&#x27;re looking for a function with type<p><pre><code>    loeb :: Functor f => f (f a -> a) -> f a
</code></pre>
and without thinking about the meaning of it, we can implement it as<p><pre><code>    loeb x = fmap (\a -> a (loeb x)) x
</code></pre>
which embodies a certain, strange kind of recursion. It turns out that it&#x27;s &quot;spreadsheet recursion&quot;. We build a list of functions from lists of a to a like<p><pre><code>    test :: [[Int] -> Int]
    test = [ (!! 1), length, (!! 0) ]   -- think [A1, length(A), A0]
</code></pre>
then `loeb test` &quot;completes&quot; the list by applying the &quot;result list&quot; to each of the functions of the source list.<p><pre><code>    loeb test == [3, 3, 3]
</code></pre>
Laziness lets the recursion proceed despite &quot;evaluating&quot; the list from left to right. Infinite loops still fail<p><pre><code>    loeb [(!! 0)] == [............ waiting
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s also interesting to think of how to do &quot;spreadsheet recursion&quot; on exotic data types like trees.<p><pre><code>    data Binary a = Branch (Binary a) a (Binary a) | Tip
                  deriving (Show, Functor)

    depth Tip            = 0
    depth (Branch l _ r) = succ (max (depth l) (depth r))

    top default Tip            = default
    top _       (Branch _ a _) = a

    > loeb (Branch Tip depth (Branch Tip (top 0) Tip))
    Branch Tip 2 (Branch Tip 2 Tip)

As a mathematician/computer scientist, I recognise that there is limited benefit to me expressing my simple thoughts in mathematical form.<p>However, I am opinionated enough to have an opinion:<p>- I believe that basic income allows people to invest in themselves through education or simply taking small risks without the constant and desperate need to either work or degradingly grovel to the state to pay for their basic upkeep. This would allow people the option of taking entrepreneurial risks which are generally available only to the upper-middle- and rich-classes. I do not believe that everyone would take any such opportunity but I believe we should seek to give this type of opportunity to everyone, and a basic income seems a fair way of doing that.<p>- I believe that basic income would create an economic shock in any country that implemented it universally, the consequences of which are not immediately obvious, may cause difficulties perhaps including rent-seeking behaviour from certain sectors and gross inflation of necessities. I believe that the unknown consequences make implementation politically difficult, but that the eventual outcome would be good for society as a whole.<p>Can you add these to your model?",1384362301

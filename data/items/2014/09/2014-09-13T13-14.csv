8312383,comment,8312070,8312371,1,0,Menlo_Park,,,"Hi natch, thanks for pointing this out! We set out initially with compiling a small survey of the tools that are most widely used among startups, since we figured they&#x27;re the ones who&#x27;re most likely to become Early Adopters. Doing this, we saw that most (some 90 something per cent) where using GitHub, DropBox and Google Drive, so we set out to add these first. However, we&#x27;re of course always trying to figure out what our potential users might be most interested in so we&#x27;re asking everyone what their favorite integrations would be - hence the feedback box during the sign up process. We&#x27;ve already identified a dozen tools and services we need to integrate with (Trello, for instance, will go live early next week) and we&#x27;re working full time on adding as many as possibly as soon as possible. If you&#x27;d like to, I&#x27;d be happy to personally notify you once JIRA is live?",1410616705

Fifty years ago a southern business would have been engaged in &quot;sober rational thinking&quot; to deny service to blacks or at worst to make sure they were &quot;properly&quot; segregated.<p>In more modern times a more apt comparison would be with respect to pregnant women. Suppose he&#x27;d written instead &quot;This is one reason I&#x27;d take the childless, single 25 year old woman over the married 32 year old. By 33 she&#x27;ll probably be pregnant or have a baby.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s very clearly discrimination, and very clearly in the negative-connotation sense.<p>For similar reasons, PG&#x27;s statements re: age are very clearly &quot;negative-connotation&quot; age discrimination. Moreover, there&#x27;s nothing particularly &quot;sober&quot; or even &quot;rational&quot; about it, considering the heaps of evidence regarding age and people who are very successful in running businesses (hint: &quot;young&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly a word that comes to mind).",1410616643

8312359,comment,8311158,8311505,2,0,DCKing,,,"I don&#x27;t think your first thought is relevant for all of this.<p>It has been quite clear for quite some time that mobile payments was not a technology problem but a policy problem. The technology was not just ready for it with the release of the Nexus S - it was ready for it for years before that! The problem was getting people to actually use it. Since most vendors were trying to use mobile payments for their own short-term gain, things were going nowhere.<p>Apple has not &quot;caught up&quot; in that sense at all since they weren&#x27;t behind in any meaningful way. There was no important reason for smartphones to have NFC as there did not exist many use cases for it <i>without</i> payments. Although I had high expectations of NFC when I bought my current Nexus phone two years ago, things simply never got off the ground in that area.<p>The contribution that Apple Pay makes to the market is quite unique if you look beyond technical merit. It provides an intuitive user interface for <i>anyone</i>&#x27;s payment product for use in mobile phones. It isn&#x27;t tied to your prepaid Google Wallet card, it isn&#x27;t tied to your SIM card, and it isn&#x27;t tied to propietary point of sale hardware. Furthermore, it is being pushed<p>I&#x27;d argue that Apple is the only one with the required leverage to push something like this into a market obsessed with conservatism and self interests. They have the power to convince shops and banks to cooperate with it, moreso than Google. Moreover, because they have their own hardware, it is easier for them to integrate a secure element and a user-friendly authorization method (the fingerprint scanner) to have an integrated solution.<p>It&#x27;s not as if Apple has reinvented the wheel or anything, and I hope nobody is claiming that. But their execution of this idea seems very good. And it is the execution of the idea, your second point, that is the important part here. I hope that Google can fight off its own and carrier interests, and follow suit with a similar application. Many Android phones already possess all required hardware.",1410616031

8312356,comment,8312070,8312070,6,0,Menlo_Park,,,"Hey guys,<p>Leo from ChatGrape here. We&#x27;re focusing on two areas of innovation, to add a certain level of intelligence to chat based team communication:<p>1. Deep Service Integrations: Our integrations of tools and services like Gmail, GitHub etc function on a much more integrated level than what has previously been achieved. For instance, on ChatGrape, all your issues (GitHub) and files (Google Drive / DropBox) are available within the chat, thanks to a smart auto complete that attaches or references all your documents - right as you type.<p>2. Speech Act Detection (Natural Language Processing): This is all about the triggering of workflows based on normal, &quot;day to day&quot; communications. For example, if I were to write, &quot;Hey Tobi, let&#x27;s meet up tomorrow at 2pm to discuss the front end issue!&quot; three things will happen: First, you&#x27;ll be notified, second a calendar event will be added to your Google Calendar and third, the topic or issue will be automatically referenced or attached.<p>Natural language processing within ChatGrape goes much further, anyhow, and is a topic where our engineering team has gained many years of experience with previous projects.<p>We&#x27;re using to make communication simpler and more efficient, whilst not disrupting your normal flow of conversation. (Another example of this is to automatically detect and mark whether / or questions, and mark them as such.)<p>ChatGrape went live in an Early Access Phase (Pre-Beta) phase about six weeks ago and not nearly everything of what&#x27;ll ultimately make ChatGrape the first smart communication solution for teams is fully operational or even deployed yet.<p>However, what I wrote above will give you guys a better idea of it is that sets ChatGrape apart from all existing solutions like Slack or Hipchat.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to your feedback and questions and I&#x27;m always available via lf@ubergrape.com! And we&#x27;d of course be happy about you guys joining our Early Access Phase to provide further feedback.",1410615925

After all these years of writing on my blog, I only have a couple hundred subscribers. If I outsource it to post more regularly, would I be more efficient and effective? Probably.<p>The thing is, my writing is noticeably better over the years. I started out just brain dumping ideas and try to slip in screenshots whenever I can so my posts didn&#x27;t look too pathetic (e.g. this one in 2008 <a href=""http://www.quantisan.com/trade-of-the-day-bailed-out-of-a-wrong-position/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quantisan.com/trade-of-the-day-bailed-out-of-a-wr...</a>. Nowadays, I do the opposite. Getting your idea across simply and effortlessly for the reader is most important (e.g. this one from March, <a href=""http://www.quantisan.com/more-problem-solving-less-solution-glorifying/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quantisan.com/more-problem-solving-less-solution-...</a>). In recent years, my posts are getting more likes, more shares, and have been on HN a couple times.<p>Writing is like programming. Anyone can do it but to be good at it, you need to keep doing it and put in the effort to improve. Or, you can spend $300 for somebody else to do it for you.",1410615300

Recursively remove /tempdir/ (if there are any files left there it means there were hardlinks to files in /sourcedir/ from other parts of the filesystem)<p>By doing this we&#x27;re using the destination filesystem to keep the map for only for the files with hard-link > 1 and doing it without using any more resources than will be used by the end of the copy as long as there aren&#x27;t any hardlinks to the same files outside /sourcedir. If there are we&#x27;ll be using an additional hard-link for each of them by the end of the copy.<p>The reason I prefer this to hand-rolling a solution is that it reuses well tested code (hard-links in the filesystem) and more importantly doesn&#x27;t introduce any resource limits that aren&#x27;t native to cp anyway, such such as having enough memory/swap to hold the map.

I still have to pull a physical token out of my pocket, and given I only use a couple of cards regularly, I don&#x27;t really care if that token is a card or a phone.<p>Next, when you start talking anti-fraud, I think there&#x27;s a reason that the push for that had to come from the payment processors.<p>From a consumer perspective, there&#x27;s absolutely no good reason to <i>care</i>. Credit card fraud liability is one area where the US has incredibly strong consumer protection laws. If my credit card information gets stolen ala the Target breach, I&#x27;m not legally liable for any charges resulting from it. The most painful thing I have to worry about is disputing the charge and getting a new card issue. That&#x27;s not a big enough deal to generate consumer demand for more secure payments.<p>Merchants have a bit more reason to care since they&#x27;re usually the ones that get stuck with fraudulent charges, but it becomes a matter of whether occasional fraud is more expensive for them than upgrading all their POS equipment. The answer from Wal-Mart and Best Buy appears to be &quot;no,&quot; and I know it&#x27;s a pretty common sentiment among small business owners who often <i>hate</i> any spending associated their merchant accounts.<p>So that really leaves the processors as the ones who stand the most to gain from this. I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s surprising that the push had to come from the supply side as a result.",1410614476

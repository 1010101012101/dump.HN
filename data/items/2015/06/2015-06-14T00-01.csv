9713394,comment,9711346,9711457,0,0,loomio,,,"Agree completely. I understand the deeper issues and concepts being discussed - because I&#x27;m the kind of person that happily takes time out of my weekend to re-read Stallman essays from 2007. However, as a SaaS startup trying to communicate with non-geek end users about our AGPL-licensed FLOSS product, we have found the misunderstandings caused by the term &quot;free&quot; insurmountable.<p>Our choices are to use &quot;open source&quot;, which more or less gets it across to lay people completely unaware of the subtleties, use &quot;free software&quot; and then launch into some long-form explanation of why we also charge money (of course anyone can grab the code for free and run their own instance but most of our customers don&#x27;t care about any of that), or say FLOSS or Libre and it&#x27;s totally unintelligible to most people and they stop paying attention before we&#x27;ve gotten anywhere.<p>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think this problem will be constructively progressed until it evolves past the realm of geeks arguing about it amongst themselves, and actually is approached as a marketing issue. Perhaps the reason the debate is still festering is there hasn&#x27;t been much alignment of incentives between the marketers and the geeks to work together on it, because most software companies don&#x27;t try to mutually hold the values of Free Software and commercial profit. But we won&#x27;t see Free Software and its underpinning values go mainstream until that happens, and I think it would be good for everyone if it did.",1434243425

It has become clear that the OOPL design space is not a dichotomy. Instead, we have identified two fundamental mechanisms, templates and empathy, and several different independent degrees of freedom for each. Templates create new objects in their own image, providing guarantees about the similarity of group members. Empathy allows an object to act as if it were some other object, providing sharing of state and behavior. Smalltalk, Actors, Lieberman&#x27;&#x27;s delegation system, Self, and Hybrid each take differing stands on the forms of templates and empathy. Some varieties of template and empathy mechanisms are appropriate for building well-understood programs that must be extremely reliable; others are better suited for rapidly prototyping solutions to difficult problems. The differences between languages designed for each of these application domains can be recast as the differences between support for anticipated vs. unanticipated sharing. One can even ascribe the ascent of object-oriented programming to its strong support for extension instead of modification. However, many kinds of extension still remain difficult. The decomposition of an object-oriented language into template and empathy mechanisms and the degree of support for extension provided by the forms of these mechanisms provide a solid framework for studying language design.",1434243403

9713390,comment,9712267,9713106,0,0,acemarke,,,"I&#x27;ve been a WebStorm fanboy since I purchased a license during a sale two years ago.  The biggest selling point for WebStorm for me is its smart searching abilities.  &quot;Find In Files&quot; doesn&#x27;t just do text search, it&#x27;s also smart enough to allow you to include or exclude matches in strings and comments.  It also has a great parser that understands the structure of your code well enough to do legitimate &quot;Find References&quot; searches with really good results in spite of Javascript&#x27;s dynamicness.<p>Obviously Python is a very dynamic language as well, so PyCharm has most of the same strong points.  I&#x27;d been using the Community edition for a while, but finally picked up a Commercial license a couple weeks ago.  In this case, the feature that finally convinced me to pay for it was no-kidding Remote Debugging.  Drop a .egg next to your deployed app and stick an extra import and connection call into your code, and then PyCharm&#x27;s debugger (which is another great feature in and of itself) just flat-out works over SSH.<p>Ultimately, both these tools have saved me enough time and effort to pay for themselves repeatedly.",1434243361

Housing prices and interest rates affect everyone; VC is just a game for rich people playing with other peoples&#x27; money by taking bets on young narcissists with big ideas.<p>So far, when VC flips its products on to the public markets, the markets react fairly rationally and the bad companies tank. Look at Zynga. The market may be overvaluing it still, but it&#x27;s nothing like the 1990s. Public markets seem to be recognizing shitty tech stocks as what they are. So, we&#x27;re not at the 1999 level of bubble.<p>Furthermore, the 2001 crash didn&#x27;t have a major effect on the economy (although it was bad for the Bay Area, and for many engineers). It wasn&#x27;t the crash, or even 9/11, but the sluggish (&quot;jobless&quot;) recovery in 2002-4 that made the 2000s (except for people on Wall Street or in the slowly recovering Valley) a shit decade.<p>So, let&#x27;s assume that the VC bubble ends. Some people will get hurt. The celebrity engineers who make $500,000 and aren&#x27;t any good will get beefed. Run-of-the-mill engineers, if they&#x27;re any good, might drop from $140k to $125k; not such a big deal. The ScrumDrone engineers will have a hard time finding work. Unfortunately, this will also hurt self-taught (meaning &quot;no college degree&quot;) engineers even if they are good; the ones who are talented are still in a position of low leverage because &quot;everyone knows&quot; (well, employers know) they&#x27;re more sensitive to a dry-up.<p>The short answer is that some people will take painful hits-- you&#x27;re going to have a lot of 25-year-olds who thought they were millionaires, find out that they worked overtime for nothing-- but average people of average-or-better talent will mostly be fine. Bay Area salaries for good engineers might go down 10 to 20 percent at worst.<p>The bad news: housing in San Francisco&#x27;s not going to become more affordable. First, the people who actually have money (not a half-million from options) are already diversified and less exposed to dot-com/VC, and the foreign money-launderers aren&#x27;t exposed to it at all. Second, people hoard rather than sell (a steep positive volume/price correlation) when the market &quot;should&quot; soften. The stupid competitiveness around getting rentals (e.g. competitive open-houses, people cutting checks for a whole year&#x27;s rent) will go away, but rents and prices will stay about where they are.",1434241463

9713294,comment,9712868,9712868,0,0,netcan,,,"I imagine that if the alleged bubble burst, VC funded startups and their immediate environment would be where the most damage was/is. A lot of startups would just fail. Employees would lose their jobs and options/shares would be wiped out. Even otherwise healthy startups could suffer or fail from the mess. If a company is worth $200m one day and $40m the next, all sorts of bad things can happen even if they are profitable.<p>Beyond the immediate vicinity of VC backed startup land I don&#x27;t think the fallout would be very severe. VC funded startups are not really a very big employers in the scheme of things. VC as an asset class isn&#x27;t a big one either. Since VC investments are expected to be high risk, most end user investors allocate only a small portion of their portfolio to the class. It is expected to be high risk and on the whole it is considered very irresponsible to depend on its success. Even startup employees do not generally treat their jobs as highly secure, so at least psychologically they are prepared to one day find themselves looking elsewhere. They are also generally employable in the much large technology fields that are not directly related to VC money.<p>For an analogy think of the hypothetical bitcoin bubble bursting. Some bitcoin centric businesses would go bust. Some gamblers would too. But I imagine that most people holding large amounts are aware of the risk, they haven&#x27;t bet the house on it.<p>I think the &quot;systemic&quot; impact would be minimal. The real dangerous bubbles are asset classes like real estate, bonds, blue chip shares and those esoteric but enormous &quot;instruments&quot; and securities. These are expected to be reliable and safe so money that must not disappear goes into them. They are also much bigger.<p>I guess you never really know unless it happens, but I doubt the kinds of levers that make big bubbles so bad are present here. A lender wouldn&#x27;t/shouldn&#x27;t be loaning out money to be invested in VC, so I don&#x27;t think you would have the kind of domino effects that make crashes spread.<p>If it was severe and scary enough with big name &quot;startups&quot; going under, tech stock prices might dip. That might be a good time to buy. I can&#x27;t see much of a relevance of a VC crash to Google, FB or MSFT&#x27;s medium term prospects.<p>EDIT: One more - Since VC is a &quot;professionals only&quot; class of investment, we are not likely to see middle class people directly impacted. This means that macro-demand shouldn&#x27;t be effected much either, except directly by employees losign their jobs and startups no longer consuming whatever they consume.",1434241056

such valuable private companies,

The answer is it doesn&#x27;t.<p>There are two basic concepts in environmental economics: positive and negative externalities. A positive externality is when someone benefits from something they don&#x27;t pay for. Markets under-produce things that create positive externalities, because the price does not reflect that externalized benefit. You correct for positive externalities with subsidies.<p>A negative externality is when someone is harmed by something they do not get compensation for. Markets over-produce things that create negative externalities, because the price does not reflect that externalized cost. You correct for negative externalities with taxes.<p>Transportation infrastructure creates positive externalities. People benefit from a train line besides those who pay to ride it. Dams create negative externalities. The environment and people downstream are harmed by diversion of water, but they don&#x27;t get compensated for that harm. Consumers buying produce <i>is not</i> a positive externality, because they pay for that produce. Water is an input to production, and the benefits accrue pretty much only to water users, or those who purchase a product or service from water users. If we stopped subsidizing water, the prices of California avocados would go up, but those prices would be <i>efficient prices</i> that correctly reflected the true cost of growing produce in a place with scarce water.",1434240143

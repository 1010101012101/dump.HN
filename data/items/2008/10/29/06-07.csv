That one sticks out at me too - the problem is that it might be beneficial in some respects to Yahoo, but IBM don't really have anything to gain out of it - If IBM partners with someone it needs to be a synergy/feedback loop with their hardware/software revenue streams.",1225262991

Nor is democracy something that ""China"" would do well with, especially given that the country in its current composition is an empire that contains several distinct countries.<p>Singapore did very well economically with a non-ideological dictatorship, as did Taiwan, both mostly peacefully, over the same postwar period that China went through successive mass slaughters.<p>One can hope that China makes the transition safely to a stable government, but while they continue to treat their various populations as simply pawns with no rights to health, safety, the rule of law, then dissatisfaction and unrest remain a risk.",1225262501

347194,comment,346912,347192,0,0,ars,,,"Appendix:<p>Part of the cost of a product is transportation. How much does it cost to transport something? The cost of the gas, plus the cost of the vehicle.<p>The cost of that vehicle? It's wages, plus the cost of transporting the parts, plus the cost of the metal, and the equipment used to make it.<p>The cost of metal? Energy used to power the machines that mine it, plus transportation, wages, and equipment.<p>Equipment? Wages, transportation, and base parts (plastic, metal, etc).<p>If you followed my thread, you see that every single cost eventually is the cost of fuel.<p>I haven't talked about wages yet. For the most part people spend all of their wages - what do they spend it on? Things. Things that have an environmental cost. Taking us back to where we started.<p>In an environment where wages are lower, it's because people spend less money on things, so those people are ""better"" for the environment.<p>I sometimes see environmentally friendly products that cost more than ordinary ones, and then I know they aren't actually that good for the environment.<p>There are two big holes here:<p>Pollution.\nHuman misery.<p>A slave gets no wages (reducing the cost of the item) and also has almost no environmental cost. But the human misery is bad, and is not taken into account.<p>It's cheaper to make things if you don't care how much you pollute.<p>So the metric is not perfect, but it's very close (especially for comparing two products made in the same type of environment (pollution regulations, prevailing wages, etc)), and it's very available.",1225261187

347192,comment,346912,346912,0,0,ars,,,"I don't know why I don't see this more often, but the environmental cost of a product is almost exactly equal to it's monetary cost.<p>Why? Because if you trace the cost of a product down to it's constituents almost every cost a product has is directly related to how much energy it takes to make it and it's parts. Even salary, because money spent on salary is based on prevailing wage, which itself is based on how much energy a person needs to live in their community.<p>Now obviously it's not perfect - in particular it doesn't include costs that are passed on to the public as a whole: most glaringly pollution of all types.<p>And possibly things that are paid for by taxes - although taxes raise the cost of the product and wages, so it's somewhat taken into account (as long as the product does not consume more than it's share of public funding).<p>But other than that it's very close.<p>So for the example here: if a paper costs $20 a month, but your computer costs $30 per month for service plus the cost of the electricity, plus the cost of the computer itself, it's a no brainer.<p>But you use your computer for other things too...<p>You want to know which car is better for the environment?

347190,comment,347137,347137,0,0,jbyers,,,"Here's a different four point plan for Yahoo!<p>1. Cut costs to the bone.  Ruthlessly reduce headcount, non-core services, and the executive roster.  Go until Wall Street thinks you're insane, then cut a bit more for good measure.  I'm talking 30% layoffs in one shot, with strong incentives for the remaining top talent to stick around. Forget about playing to the interests of Silicon Valley startups and idealogues.  Sell or shutter the acquisitions that don't have a path to material revenue contribution.  Fire the consultants.  Put a small team of passionate executives in the driver's seat, top up their options, and fire the rest.  Make it clear that bureaucracy, infighting, and complacency are over.<p>2. Replace Jerry Yang with a leader who is aggressive, fearless, and given a long leash by the board to steer Yahoo! to a new corporate identity.  I actually think Jerry is a good leader, I just believe he's in an impossible situation and needs to be freed from Yahoo! for his and the company's benefit.  Ideally promote from within someone who has the passion and vision to lead, maybe paired with an outsider who the axe-man.<p>3. Explore any deal that boosts monetization of Yahoo's massive traffic.  Swallow pride, and get solidly in the black.  The levers are well within reach, the Yahoo! brand is still a tremendous force on the Internet, and the company sits atop a formidable set of services.  Sidle up to your enemies if they'll help you achieve profitability.<p>4. Rediscover Yahoo's soul.  While it would be nice to do this ahead of the unpleasant cuts described above, I don't think it's possible.  This will be possible when the company is unencumbered by historical baggage, unburdened by a tremendously depressed stock price, and full of people excited to figure out together what the next chapter is for the company.  The new soul of Yahoo! will not be found in a consultant's report, executive talking points, a set of loosely-joined web 2.0 startups.<p>Disclaimer: I am a Yahoo! shareholder.",1225260171

347187,comment,347137,347170,0,0,netcan,,,"I agree. These are a series of possible plays. Maybe even tactical plays. We can argue about their merit till the cows come home. But where is the 'This is how we'll win.'<p>Making Flickr into a sort of services that could make some people money or some people might be willing to pay for is ok. If they can do it without killing it (always a chance) then they might make a viable business out of it.<p>But then, how big a business would that be? Istockphoto got $71.9m in 07'. Sure that's not shabby. But say Yahoo can match that. That'd be an achievement in itself. A best case.<p>Since they supposedly bought it for $35m, that'd even make it reasonably good acquisition.<p>But its' hardly a revolution. It adds about 1% to yahoo's total revenue.<p><i>Owning the living room</i> means going head to head with Sony, MS, Apple & Cable Companies to take a market that doesn't really exist yet, may never exist in the way we think & noone knows what it's worth. All we know is that competition is evil.<p>Billions? I don't see how. At least not immediately. Strategy? Again, I don't see it. Honestly, being in charge of Yahoo would suck right now.",1225260012

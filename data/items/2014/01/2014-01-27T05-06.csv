If wealth concentrates to the top over time, then most people could be worse off, and a few be spectacularly rich, even if desires remain unchanged.<p>&quot;Oh, OK then, we&#x27;ll just peacefully crawl over here and die then.&quot;<p>If the government utilities stop providing water and power to your house, what do you do? (I assume you want those things.)<p>Yes, you could switch to solar, or a generator. And you could drill a well and harvest rainwater. These are high costs. Can most people afford doing that? And afford the higher maintenance?<p>Or you might get a non-government utility to come in. Which means they need a line from the power plant and a pipe from the water works, both to your house. There&#x27;s a lot of people in between who might say &quot;no&quot; to the request to string a power line or dig a trench across their property. (The concept of &quot;right-of-way&quot; requires some sort of coercion.)<p>Yes, it&#x27;s doable. There are entire communities which are off the grid. But costs time and money, which most people aren&#x27;t interested in doing.<p>Or you could sneak in and hook up to the government utilities, so each time they&#x27;ll disconnect and make it harder.<p>Or you could connect to your neighbors. Then the government disconnects them.<p>This is inconvenience, not violence. Where&#x27;s the government force in my example? But yet it is coercive, yes?<p>When I graduated from college, I had to pay off a small library fine before I could get my diploma. The college didn&#x27;t force me to pay the fee. But the threat that I wouldn&#x27;t get my diploma unless I paid was a very big incentive. So I know at least one case where this model of mine makes a good prediction.<p>&quot;what that peace is built on&quot;. The &quot;men-with-guns&quot; models simplifies that to the point of farce. There are incentives to having and being part of a good government. There are means of coercion other than force. And there are men-with-guns in places without government.",1390802122

7129024,comment,7128480,7129002,21,0,scarmig,,,"There&#x27;s some small bit of gray area here, but I think most of those situations should still qualify as rape.<p>Prison guards have immense power over inmates. Their decisions can give a prisoner a plush gig or a terrible one; can allow for the prisoner to receive medical care or not; can result in a prisoner being punished severely for an infraction or escape with just a slap on the wrist or even nothing at all. The discretion of prison guards can even determine whether a prisoner will have the opportunity to be raped by another prisoner or not, or determine whether the prisoner ends up the sexual property of a nice owner or a brutal one.<p>In those circumstances, it&#x27;s incredibly problematic to say that the prisoner had free choice in the matter: it&#x27;s akin to asking a woman to have sex with you and at the same time off-handedly mentioning how unfortunate it&#x27;d be if she made you angry. It&#x27;s a choice without a real choice.<p>The idea that men cannot be raped while being the penetrator is one that has to go.",1390802048
7129023,comment,7126754,7127606,4,0,icambron,,,"That generated more response than I expected. I actually <i>do</i> agree that, on balance, it&#x27;s somewhat more likely that it&#x27;s just a benign glitch; I should have said that. What I was really taking issue with is the dismissiveness with you treated the suggestion that this might be an NSA attack. I was responding to what I saw as a slanted and unreasonable framing by doing the same thing from the other end.<p>So with less snark: I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s exceedingly improbable at all, and whether ultimately it turns out to be the case or not, smugly guffawing the idea that the NSA may have used a trick like that isn&#x27;t warranted. They really do intercept people&#x27;s laptop shipments [1] to plant malware in them. They really do sneak tiny radio transmitters into end-user hardware. They really are trying to get backdoors into communication tools. I&#x27;ll put it this way: if I worked on the kind of software Andrea works on, I would be seriously alarmed. Would you keep the keyboard?<p>On some specific points you made:<p>* That Snowden had access to other people&#x27;s credentials seems like a serious operational shortcoming to me. The &quot;low-level&quot; part wasn&#x27;t an attack on Snowden; the point is that a lot of people have that level of access. In general, the US intelligence apparatus makes a lot of well-publicized mistakes; I&#x27;m sure they make a great number of more subtle ones.<p>* On the NSA&#x27;s shortcomings generally, I think this is actually nicely illustrative. Because a lot of the stuff Snowden revealed were things a lot of credible people already believed, based on things like weird locked server closets in telecom buildings and PRNGs that seemed fishy and pointless and heresay reports of requests for backdoor access to communication tools and so on. There was just little hard evidence before Snowden. And there won&#x27;t be here either. So this is entirely consistent with the what the NSA was like in those decades where their programs &quot;never saw the light of day&quot;.<p>* I think being a core Tor developer makes her high value target. It&#x27;s hard to imagine the NSA wanting to subvert all the things it&#x27;s subverted and not wanting to backdoor Tor. Keylogging her keyboard is a great way to do that, either by compromising her somehow, or by just stealing her credentials. So I don&#x27;t follow the &quot;it doesn&#x27;t make any sense&quot; line of thinking.<p>* That she&#x27;s now tweeted about certainly makes it unlikely that, if the NSA has it, they&#x27;ll go through with sending it bugged. But so?<p>Where I come out on this is that yes, it&#x27;s probably nothing, but it should be treated with suspicion and carefulness, not laughed off because <i>haha, what, do you think you&#x27;re in a spy movie or something?</i> Because, basically, we are.<p>[1] Yes, I know this is just the keyboard. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a relevant difference.",1390802046

It&#x27;s happened within recent memory. They have contingency plans. Contrast with the United States, where such a thing is the stuff of fantasy, mostly to do with China&#x27;s military, and our contingency plans seem to involve cutting our leaders off from the world and waiting it out.<p>2) Americans wouldn&#x27;t stand for a unified identification system. The moment you propose it, you&#x27;d have the Moral Majority breathing down your neck about giving in to the UN and taking a step towards a One World Government. This kind of religiosity permeates our entire civic culture. The very idea of modifying the Constitution horrifies even intelligent commentators, because it was written 200 years ago so it must obviously work well. This is the exact same logic you see from Bible-thumpers.<p>I really appreciate both the notion of the &quot;boring European state&quot; and the &quot;start-up mindset&quot; that Tamkivi brings up, though they&#x27;re somewhat at odds. A boring government is a good objective; you don&#x27;t want the government to be interesting: you want it to work. It makes little sense to me to think of growth as an end rather than a means, but I admit I&#x27;m not good at economics; I can see its need when you need a buffer zone for experimentation, but I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s any kind of measure of success.",1390801915

If they want customizable software, the market will give it to them. If they only want feature X, the market will give it to them. If they want interop., they will get that too. If they don&#x27;t care about modifying the source code, well, people won&#x27;t offer it.<p>The GPL is not what allows users to get what they need from software or technology. It&#x27;s the market. As long as you have a free market, with able competitors, you don&#x27;t need the GPL, and the whole discussion of &quot;free software&quot; is a red-herring. As far as mainstream users are concerned, you don&#x27;t need the source when you have the dollar.<p>Stallman&#x27;s initial experience with closed software was not in a free market, so I can see how he&#x27;s grown up with a colored view. The world has changed, however, and he has not.<p>Stallman&#x27;s original problem was essentially, &quot;I had a broken car once and I couldn&#x27;t get the part I needed to repair it.

(These numbers are averages, but the basic relationship holds across industries.)<p>I personally do not see how SMBs can compete when they are paying 4x more for labor.<p>The reason big business is so efficient is IT investment, and the problem with IT investment is that you need to be big in order to really take advantage of it. The amount of improvement SMBs get for a proportional amount of investment is low. You have to spend a lot to get anything, really, and  SMBs just can&#x27;t afford that.<p>So, to recap: big business profits stay high because SMBs actually can&#x27;t force prices downward, due to the huge imbalance in labor costs between SMBs and big business.<p>If we could get the same IT advantage to SMBs at a cost that is proportional to their revenue, then the dynamic you expect to be occurring would, in fact, happen.",1390800319

Because they can make more money doing this and it&#x27;s not illegal because they are the law. They do not care about the good will of the customer, because the extra cost to the customer is not enough for the customer to act on. Prices are set to what the market will pay, in this case it&#x27;s as close to revolt as the business can get away with.<p>I would also like to point out that I don&#x27;t disagree with your assertion that their are negatives with a government controlled monopoly on law enforcement, I disagree with the idea that a free market system for it would not be subject to worse corruption/abuse.<p>Well, ask yourself, these days, how many people can you convince that bullying is a good idea?

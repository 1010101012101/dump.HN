I believe Ansible has been addressing this, but at the time we did our evals last year it was a concern. We skipped Puppet due to DSL and Chef because we didn&#x27;t want to delve into Ruby (I love Ruby, but it&#x27;s not a tier-1 language for us like Python).<p>So far in our largest datacenter, which has 2700+ hosts, we are able to manage it with a single Salt master.

8137555,comment,8136268,8136268,1,0,adamtj,,,"This article was only mildly interesting to me.  I think there is a better story tangential to it.<p>The article is only mildly interesting because it gets at the truth behind the idea that Eskimos have 40 different words for snow.  If I didn&#x27;t know that, it would have been very interesting.  But, of course, that common wisdom is wrong.  I would be surprised if there&#x27;s anybody who doesn&#x27;t at least suspect that&#x27;s the case.  The truth is never as clean and perfect as the stories we tell, which makes it more boring.  But, the truth is much more powerful.  That power is exciting.  I&#x27;ll always chose to take the boring but powerful truth, even if it ruins the fun story for me.  I do, however, have a passing interest in linguistics, so it was nice to learn something about the Eskimo language family.<p>However, there&#x27;s an obvious tangent to this article that I think is more interesting and more powerful: I figured this article would be about snowclones, or at least mention them.  It&#x27;s not and it didn&#x27;t.<p>&quot;Snowclone&quot; is a really interesting word that was coined only a decade ago.  You could say that it names an idea that was recently discovered: that many phrases are specific instances of some clichéd template.  The phrase isn&#x27;t the cliché and may even be unique.  Rather, it&#x27;s the template that&#x27;s familiar.<p>For example, &quot;If Eskimos have 40 words for &#x27;snow&#x27;, politicians surely have dozens of words for &#x27;lie&#x27;.&quot;  More generally, &quot;If Eskimos have N words for snow, X surely have Y words for Z.&quot;  Also, &quot;X is the new black&quot;, or even &quot;X is the new Y&quot;.  It&#x27;s a name for a phrase that&#x27;s a clone of that one about Eskimo words for snow.  Hence, snowclone.<p><a href=""http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000350.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000350.h...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowclone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowclone</a><p>Of course, this idea was known to people long before &quot;snowclone&quot; was coined.  When I say the idea was recently &quot;discovered&quot;, I mean that in somewhat the same sense that, after the Age of Discovery opened the globe to them, Western naturalists &quot;discovered&quot; and named many animals and plants that were well known to indigenous peoples and had even been seen by previous western explorers.  Still, the West didn&#x27;t come to know those animals until somebody recognized them as new and gave them a good name.  Ok, maybe this analogy is stretched.  Still...<p>To simply encounter something doesn&#x27;t mean we recognize it for what it is, or that we can distinguish it from other similar things.  We need names for that.<p>I think good names are more important than we generally give them credit for.  A good name is like a handle on an axe-head.  Hand axes have a long history and are among the first tools that humans made.  Attaching a handle to one gives much more leverage, which makes chopping easier and more efficient.  A handle even enables the use of a heavier, more powerful axe head.  Good names similarly make ideas both more powerful and at the same time easier to work with than they were before they were named.",1407253869

The money aggregators take is used to fund Google visibility (paid or free) rather than for the hotels to use on other things.<p>There have been times in the past were Google&#x27;s listings definitely were bad, like the whole Demand Media/content &quot;farm&quot; fiasco. The model of writing low quality and outright false content has largely moved from the how to articles on to news now, for better or worse.<p>The bigger issue is mobile means less results. A few ads and one or two visible organic listings. Google has to milk the hell out of desktop users to make up for lost revenue. If we move to voice search its going to really be different. You either dominate or get nothing, no in between.<p>Google has a model that works and makes a lot of revenue. They will not and can not innovate because those innovations will destroy the model. It is the same for any entrenched legacy corporation. Search is a good area to do innovative work in today.<p>Update: One other note. It was always clear to me that Google&#x27;s business model was to provide huge volumes of free traffic, and then remove it. If you didn&#x27;t buy traffic and you relied on that free organic stuff you were asking for trouble. Many companies have ranked organically for a term. Expanded, took on long term liabilities, and then lost their rankings and failed. Most of the business owner Google complaints we hear come from those type of people.

Same reason cell phone companies are offering unlimited plans - they provide comfort that you won&#x27;t go over.<p>How do hostgator and many others offer Unlimited Disk Storage & Bandwith for such a low price? Because they know that even if they posted real limits, most customers won&#x27;t even go close to those, and I bet they deal directly with those that do to optimize.  Saying &quot;Unlimited&quot; is worth the (likely small) risk to close the deal.  Listen to the customer, they&#x27;re telling you what they want!<p>Something to consider, not sure how they would respond - what if you charged by the size of the organization (churches : church members)? That would loosely approximate bandwidth, and probably make sense to your customer.<p>One other thing I would point out, a little customization goes a long way. Can you offer to customize the site for their organization, or their specific needs, for low cost or free?  You want a recurring customer, right? Put in a little work up front (show them their possible site?) and you may have a better chance of closing the deal.  IMO, for non-technical clients, it&#x27;s much easier to sell them on something they can see.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t give up on this just yet, I think it&#x27;s a nice niche, but you really need to understand the customer needs and why they would or wouldn&#x27;t make a purchase decision.",1407253455

It was possible but kludgy.<p>I don&#x27;t get it - how is creating a configuration file related to the processing of the items, why would you do it in items pipeline?<p>> It&#x27;s more the fact that it has its own weird configuration/setup quirks (e.g. its own settings.py, reliance on environment variables, executables).<p>It is possible to create a Crawler from any settings object (not just a module), and Scrapy does not rely on executables AFAIK. But this all is poorly documented. Also, there is an ongoing GSoC project to make settings easier and more &quot;official&quot;.<p>> I don&#x27;t really want scrapy doing process handling at all.<p>Scrapy doesn&#x27;t handle processes, it is single-threaded and uses a single process. This means that you can use e.g. a shared in-process state.<p>> Using other code to do serialization also doesn&#x27;t necessitate running it on the same process. You can import the django ORM wherever you want and use it to save to the DB. I know you can do that - but, again, kludgy.<p>You can&#x27;t move Python objects between processes without serialization. Why is using django ORM kludgy in Scrapy but not in Celery?<p>> The problem it is solving (distributed task processing) is not an easy problem. Celery is not simple, but it is GOOD.<p>You don&#x27;t necessarily need distributed task processing to do web crawling. Celery is a great piece of software, and it is developing nicely, but you always pay for complexity. For example, I faced the following problems when I was using Celery:<p>* When redis was used as a broker its memory usage was growing infinitely. Lots of debugging, found a reason and a hacky way to overcome it (<a href=""https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/436"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/436</a>). The issue was fixed, but apparently there is still a similar issue when MongoDB is used as a broker.<p>* Celery stopped processing without <i>anything</i> useful in logs (and of course Celery error sending facilities failed and I didn&#x27;t have external monitoring) - it turns out an unicode exception was eaten. A couple of days of nightmarish debugging; see <a href=""https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/92"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/92</a>.<p>* I implemented an email sender using Celery + RabbitMQ once. I think I was sending email text to tasks as parameters. Never do that (just use MTA:)! When a large batch of emails was sent at once RabbitMQ used all memory, corrupted its database, dropped the queue; I haven&#x27;t found a way to check which emails were sent and which were not. This was 100% my fault, but it shows that complex setup is not your friend.<p>Crawling tasks differ - e.g. if you need to crawl many different websites (which is not uncommon) you will almost certainly be IO and CPU limited. Scrapy is not a system for distributed task processing, it is just an event-loop based crawler. I&#x27;m not saying your way to solve the problem is wrong; if you already use celery it makes a lot of sense to use it for crawling as well. But I don&#x27;t agree that going distributed turtles all the way down with celery+redis+DB for storage+... is easier or more efficient than using plain Scrapy. A lot of tasks can be solved by writing a spider, getting a json file with data and doing whatever one wants with it (upload to DB, etc).",1407252826

This involves buying stock in companies traded on both Canadian and US exchanges, such as TD. You buy on one exchange (in your case on a US exchange), journal over to the other exchange, and then sell on other exchange. With the right online broker, journaling is automatic, and the entire process takes a few minutes to complete.<p>The final costs for the exchange are the trading fees (typically $10 per transaction for an online broker), the bid-ask spread, and any fluctuation in price between the buy and sell price (this can be in either direction---gains are taxable). Fluctuations over periods of a few minutes should be small for a highly liquid and stable stock. Always use limit orders to protect against any unusual events such as a flash crash.<p>There are lots of links found through a web search that describe the process and which Canadian online brokers make this easy to do. Also see <a href=""http://www.northernraven.ca/financial/NGcalculator.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.northernraven.ca/financial/NGcalculator.php</a> for a calculator that helps you select which stock to use.

Since most are very non-technical, the premise is to remove all technical aspects from setting up/having a website. Each site is build on a pre-built WordPress theme and I take care of getting the site to functional stage, content entry, file uploads etc. etc. Basically, the user signs up, sends in their content and I hand over a completed website. The only thing they have to do is add new content if they want to. I am also part of the Microsoft Bizspark program so I am running everything on VMs built in Azure. A CDN, backups etc. etc. are also included with the hosting. In other words, I am not using some $20 reseller hosting plan for host gator.<p>I could be wrong, but I think my product is pretty good and there is a need of what I am offering. Clearly, I am doing something wrong because I can&#x27;t get customers. I&#x27;ve talked to local churches/non-profits, made calls, sent emails, bought online ads, wrote guest blog posts et.c etc. Really, the only substantial, feedback I have received is that I was turned down because I don&#x27;t offer &quot;unlimited&quot; everything like other hosts do...<p>I&#x27;m at the point to where I don&#x27;t really see the benefit of keeping this thing going. I could be wrong but I feel like most non-profits/churches are distrusting of website companies, don&#x27;t see the value in paying for quality when something else is cheaper, and the whole concept of using a website to further their vision seems like a waste of time. It seems like the only way I could get customers is to spend 80/hr a week writing content and personally meeting with people.<p>I want to help churches/non-profits but it seems like helping and making money is off the table.

So always have some randomly chosen results to guarantee mixing, and always include some degree of user input to give better and more relevant results chosen by humans. I think you could build good results like this, while completely ignoring any sort of complex ranking algorithm which is both too stable, too prone to gaming, and in conflict with the revenue stream of ads. Obviously you&#x27;d have to be careful about which users you listened to, but that is a solvable problem if you can persuade people to register to get better results.<p>It&#x27;s definitely well past time for a few serious non-corporate competitors to google to emerge, if only to keep Google honest.",1407251224

My problem is that you framed your thread title and general discussion so that it implies that Dart is lacking in JSON support. It&#x27;s not; Dart&#x27;s JSON support is better than or on par with almost all other languages out there (including JavaScript). The problem for you is that it lacks a certain <i>style</i> of JSON support, which I think you&#x27;ll find a hard time arguing why it&#x27;s basic functionality.<p>> I didn&#x27;t put it there, the people did.<p>Come on. You submitted it, and did not want it on the front page?<p>> That&#x27;s the whole point - there is no sensible way to implement this from the outside; that&#x27;s the whole point of my thread. All of the ways of achieving this suck for one reason or another. Doing this well needs better support from the language/Dart tools.<p>Yes there is. Dart&#x27;s reflection APIs are more than adequate for you to implememt such a thing. Reflection is the way to go in these statically typed languages; it&#x27;s how Java libraries do it, and it&#x27;s how C# does it. It&#x27;s the only way to dynamically construct classes.<p>> I&#x27;ve still yet to see anyone anywhere post a small code sample showing a Dart class and some simply JSON that works, without a hand-coded mapping from a Map. Is this really what we should be spending our time doing using Google&#x27;s &quot;new language for the web&quot;?<p>If you choose to spend your time on that, that&#x27;s your choice. Why do you find it necessary? Do you <i>really</i> want to use a web service as an ORM?<p>Web applications come with no obligation to have a direct JSON <-> typesafe class mapping. Such mappings are ill-defined and bug prone if done automatically or with runtime reflection, and open to different styles of implementation. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the job of the core library to solve that problem for you, not if it already allows you to work with JSON in other ways. Many people are fine to just use the Maps without the unjustified pretense of type safety, and other people are fine with manual mapping and <i>validation</i>. Considering the problems of reflective mapping and the availability of plenty of other solutions, I think you are being overzealous in your complaining.",1407250882

A big part of that is Francesco. I&#x27;m very happy that Inaka is now part of his family :)",1407250878

Once a year?<p>About once a month: <a href=""http://www.synology.com/en-global/releaseNote/model/DS412+"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.synology.com/en-global/releaseNote/model/DS412+</a><p>Synology uses the same base distro across all their devices, so everyone gets updates at about the same time. The device emails me when a new software version is available.<p>I get what you&#x27;re saying, but in this case it&#x27;s totally wrong. They&#x27;re very active about providing updates to add functionality (even to old systems!) and fix stuff.<p>So back to my original position: this is not an unreasonable thing to expect to be able to run on the Internet. It&#x27;s a modern Linux box that gets monthly updates, designed with the explicit intention of providing secure services over the public Internet. It would absolutely suck if that proved not to be the case.",1407250852

Both TD[1] and RBC[2] offer cross-border banking accounts, meaning that you can open a TD/RBC account in Canada and a TD/RBC account in the US and link them together, which should allow you to transfer funds between them at an optimum rate. You should be able to deposit US cheques with their smartphone apps. The issue with this approach is that you will have to maintain two bank accounts that you may have to pay monthly fees separately or maintain a minimum balance.<p>There should also be some banks in Canada (including TD and RBC) that offer US Dollar accounts, such as this one from Scotia[3] that seems to offer direct deposit, so maybe look those up as well.<p>Otherwise, foreign exchange sites like XE or Xoom may be an option as others have mentioned here, but I&#x27;m not too familiar with them.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.tdbank.com/personal/cross-border-banking.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tdbank.com/personal/cross-border-banking.html</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/cross-border-banking/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/cross-border-banking/index.html</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/0,,59,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/0,,59,00.html</a>",1407250823

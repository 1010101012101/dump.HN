That means that if the ground isn't where the robot expects it to be, the leg will still assume the same position and cause the robot to fall over.<p>The dynamic force control system is, instead of controlling the leg position, controlling the amount of force that the leg is exerting on the ground.  This means that the leg may end up in a different position than the walking controller intended, but the overall effect on the main body should be similar to what was expected.",1274662756

He talked a lot of richness, 
richer-country->more services->better wealth and so on,
but he refused to speak about inequality.
USA is as unequal as many african countries,
have very high incarceration rate and so on (and it is not the richest country in per capita terms - Norway is richer).
Well, inequality creates concentration of power in the hands of a small group of people, creates feeling of unfairness in society (""the rigged towards rich fat cats""), increase overall stress on people. Did mr Bernanke ask regular folks - bus drivers, sales clerks, janitors - are they happy? or happier that 40 years ago?

When I was working on the effort to move all the different search properties into google.com - which involved teams in 5 different offices scattered all across the U.S. and China - there were quite a few meetings, several at odd times to accommodate the time zones.  (My tech lead took the brunt of that herself, though.)  When I was working on the visual redesign, which mostly involved a tight team colocated in a single cube - I came in when I felt like, because if I needed to talk to someone, I could just turn around and ask them something.<p>Also, oftentimes interns don't have a firm grasp on which meetings they can skip and which they really should show up for.  There are at least 4 weekly or bi-weekly meetings on my calendar that I rarely go to unless the particular week's topic is relevant to what I'm doing.  I always go to meetings that are specifically scheduled with me, and usually go to the daily standups.  It takes a while to develop the organizational awareness to make the distinction, though a usually good rule of thumb is that meetings that someone specifically sets up with you should be attended, while meetings that you're invited to simply by virtue of being a member of some group can safely be skipped.",1274662367

I'd argue that's more useful than fashion (does it <i>have</i> a use?), and remember that stick-figure shirts occasionally <i>explode</i> in popularity (I remember a big burst several years ago).  XKCD is just a superior-taste subset of those.<p>edit: heck, ""fashion"" hasn't served me too well anyway.  I wore a blue-screen-of-death shirt to one of my interviews, and got the job.  The interviewer called the boss in to laugh at the shirt :)",1274659274

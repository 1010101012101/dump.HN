OS X requires special cases in any build script, even in portable *.pro files of Qt projects.<p>So to me, as a developer and problem solver, OS X confronts me with a lot more distractions and nasty behavior than any other Unix-like system, including Windows+MinGW.<p>(This is because the MinGW cross compilers behave like normal GCC/Binutils as far as possible for the Windows platform. However, this solely because MinGW is developed by a group of volunteers, while the GCC functionality for OS X is developed by Apple. MinGW would surely look worse if it had been developed by Microsoft.)",1292605187

Many of the best developers, some my personal ‘developer heroes’, have made the switch to OS X.<p>It’s All About the Mentality<p>I respect and admire programmers like @migueldeicaza, @mitsuhiko, mandrake, @dhh for all they have accomplished. One thing they all have in common, present day, is running OS X. Mandrake cowrote Enlightenment (which is the original really cool window manager for Linux), Miguel started Gnome, and the majority of code both Mitsuhiko (wrote almost every useful Python library ever) and DHH (Ruby on Rails) write run on Linux backends to say the least.<p>What are they most known for? Problem solving skills mixed with actually producing / releasing.<p>Linux is Open Source<p>And this, I believe, is why great developers tend to move towards OS X (yes, there are plenty of exceptions). A critical piece of writing software is focus. When a problem solver uses a Linux desktop, they are immediately confronted with the possibility of being able to modify every part of their system. When a problem solver runs OS X, their options are severely limited, by design.<p>I think all of us are guilty for hunting down PPAs to get a backported browser, or running ‘./configure && make && make install’ at some point. And when you have programming skills, source code can turn into a detriment to productivity when you start modifying projects outside of what you intended to accomplish. All of a sudden you start hacking a project for a few minutes, and wake up days later in a coding haze with all of that time lost.<p>Personally I have had experience with this while using old Linux distributions. We have SLES 9 systems and SLES 10 systems here at work, and in the past year I have spent countless hours hacking Sprint 3G wireless drivers, USB over IP, Firefox 3 and countless others to work on these older systems. Why? Not because they are the primary goal, but because I could, which in turn took up time from things I actually “wanted” to do.<p>Time is Valuable<p>Watching one of Miguel’s presentations, he mentions that he does not have enough years left to “worry about memory management” and that they leave that to the younger folks. This is the crux of the argument. For programmers, there is far too much opportunity for distraction at every avenue. We don’t know how long we will be here for, but certainly we know that nothing we care about will get done as long as our focus is spread so thin across the spectrum of Linux.<p>Summary<p>This is all just food for thought, not a judgement against any form of desktop or usage pattern. For reference, I am still running Ubuntu on my desktop, and being wildly unproductive on the tasks I want to finish.",1292604965

Half of that would normally need to be paid as income tax to government. That's around 1 billion dollars every year.<p>So what you do? You get the best financial advisors and they'll tell you...

2016754,story,,,1,0,buzzzlight,"Ask HN: What to do when there is no solution?",,"I just spent the last several days setting up an SVN server and configuring Xcode to use it.  It's a shining example of a task that should have been quite simple but is fraught with danger.  Here is some background for my question, you can skip the dividers if you want:<p>------------------------------------------------------------<p>By default, it excludes .a files from the repository, meaning that all of the carefully built libraries in my engine (and more importantly the copies my associates use) don't get uploaded.<p>After spending the last several hours on the following wild goose chases:<p><pre><code>  ~/.subversion/config\n  global-ignores = *.a *.la\n  svn status --no-ignore\n  svn add --no-ignore *.a\n  svn propset svn:ignore -R\n  svn propdel svn:ignore -R\n</code></pre>\nAnd hoping the following commands would exist (they don't seem to):<p><pre><code>  global-no-ignores = *.a *.la\n  svn propset svn:no-ignore\n  svn propset svn:ignore NO *.a\n</code></pre>\nI have come to the conclusion that it may be impossible to tell svn to NOT ignore certain files that it ignores by default.  I do have access to the server and can probably tell it not to ignore .a files.  But this concerns me, because if we move to hosted solution somewhere, I may not have that level of control.  Or I can recursively check for new .a files each time I commit and add them if they are missing.  I have not found an ideal solution.<p>P.S. This is the tip of the iceberg, yes I have considered that perhaps I should build all libs from scratch on each dev machine.  Yes I have considered not keeping third party libs and sources in our repository.  And so on.<p>P.P.S. I found far more problems with svn than just this.  To name a few, svn update has problems if there are unversioned items in the directory (it doesn't offer a clean way to automagically merge them into the repository).  It can't handle special item names like Apple's Icon0x0D files.  It creates a .svn folder in every folder.  There is a looming minefield having to do with line endings.  Binary files and special folders like ""build"" are not handled elegantly.  Hidden directories like .libs were missed.  And so on and so on and so on.<p>------------------------------------------------------------<p>After using svn, I see now why Linus made git.  Unfortunately, it's not supported by Xcode (yet).  And also unfortunately, Linus doesn't have the fraydar to know when a solution is getting mired in complexity.  Git may be a little too cryptic for mortals.<p>Now, my real question is this: I deal with these sorts of situations day in and day out.  90% of my time and effort goes towards working around things that are broken that should not have been broken in the first place.  I spend hours reading Stack Overflow posts, forums and mail server archives.  I nearly always find the solution.<p>But what if I can't?<p>What if after several days, I arrive at a dead end?  And worse, what does this constant rat race do to our productivities and psyches?  Will we ever be free of the menace of unimaginative tools and methodologies?<p>This may be the question of our time, at least, as hackers.  Because that's what hackers do, they hack at problems until either they or the problem is destroyed.<p>But I am becoming concerned that maybe that problem is with the problems themselves.  Maybe header search paths were a bad idea.  Maybe shared libraries and DLL hell were a bad idea.  Maybe installation at root instead of the user path was a bad idea.  Maybe the entire hard drive should be version controlled.  Maybe regex created more problems than it solved.  Maybe powerful but unreadable languages like perl and bash created a generation of programmers who do the mental equivalent of wiring houses with all the same colored cables.  Maybe the web should have just hosted and parsed .doc files so the masses could have made their own websites 15 years ago.  Maybe permissions in OS X use a stricter but much more brittle inheritance than the parent inheritance of OS 9.  Maybe the problems are even grander than the scale of the ones that I have faced in just the last few days.  Maybe I could go on forever but I am even starting to question what I know and don't know.  Maybe I should have blogged this.  Maybe I should be out buying christmas presents and spending time with my family.<p>There is IRC and countless startups attacking this problem, but what if, like politics, there is no easy solution?

Find your talent before the pitches start and win them over. Nearly everyone has some pet project they'd rather work on, so you may need to listen to theirs' first and let them dismiss it as a crazy idea. Tell them you think it is genius and try to relate it to a part of your project.  This wins recruits.<p>3. Cull. Fire the non-essential team members by taking them over to another group and introducing them to the group. Then run.  This may seem cruel, but it will save you from bloat and slowness.<p>3. Refocus every 90 minutes.  If you have a small, smart team, the duties will shake out quickly.  But pull everyone back together for 5 minutes every 90 to give updates and to refocus.  This is a modified pomodoro and will keep everyone from going down rabbit trails or checking out of the project. You have to lead.<p>4. Brag.  For the final pitch, share your failures and successes brazenly.  Show off your team's skills and openly address gaps in skill or knowledge. You will be approached afterwards if someone loves your enthusiasm but sees where they could fill in a gap.  Show your product, holes and all.\nIt gets you honest feedback faster and will carry you through to full execution if you listen.  Good luck.",1292604728

But I am not familiar the inner mechanics enough to claim that fear is a requisite for an adrenalin response. Some define fear as that hormonal response itself though.<p>Even with regards to perception of danger, one's reaction, involvement and urgency can be quite different when it is accompanied by fear and when it is not. This of course does not always work in one's favor. So you have instances of ""petrified with fear"". But is it beneficial more often than not ? My gut feeling is yes.<p>To add to you example of crossing a street: one can be rational about crossing streets. But when you suddenly realize you are about to be hit by a stray car, you do not have sufficient time to reason about relative velocities, trajectories and models of a driver's behavior. You just jump, hopefully out of the way, in fear/reflex.<p>But I agree that our fear responses have lagged behind in relevance, with respect to our changing world. But that is true even with other biological preferences. Say with our preference for fatty food. Evolution is after all a high latency process.<p>I believe personnel in hazardous situations are trained not to be insensitive to fear but to be choosy about what to fear and to react rationally to it....atleast in theory.",1292604727

2016605,comment,2016136,2016484,0,0,powrtoch,,,"Pain, yes. Fear, debatable.<p>Fear plays a role in helping people to assess danger, and in making decisions related to your survival and well being. Neither of these things <i>require</i> a fear response though. The article mentions that the woman might have found herself in dangerous situations more often due to her inability to fear, but at best this means that fear might be a useful addition to our ability to assess danger.<p>It seems to me that the vast majority of situations that are dangerous are either a) obviously so, or b) the opposite. In obviously dangerous situations, you should be able to pick up on the danger by common sense and act accordingly (I don't feel fear every time I cross the street, but I also don't step out in front of cars). In situations where the danger element is very hidden away, it's unlikely you'd get a fear response anyway, since your intuition is only as good as its input.<p>That leaves a third category, that for which the danger is non-obvious, but fear gives us an evolved intuitive-response to be wary. My argument would be that this is a small and constantly shrinking class of situations, because the environment most of us find ourselves in is so strikingly different than the one in which we evolved. You might have an evolved, intuitive fear response to the sound of a lion's roar, but this does no good whatsoever for most people in the world. So most of the dangerous situations we actually encounter, we deal with using reason and learned behavior rather than fear instinct.<p>That's my stance anyway. The only area in which I can see a concrete use for fear is its ability to stimulate a very quick flight reaction in certain dangerous situations. That is, things that you need to react to before you have time to think them through. Again, less common in the modern western world, but it does put at least one point in the pro-fear column.",1292602428

It succeeded in that, and Sony is no longer threatening Microsoft across a range of areas. This was a wise strategic move, and profit was not the main motive.</i><p>If you think that btilly is not describing and then praising wealth destruction in that quote about Microsoft's Xbox business, please downvote this comment. Thanks.<p>HOW TO DESTROY WEALTH:<p>When I spend $100 on materials and labor, and I can -- at best -- sell the result to you for $80, $20 of wealth is destroyed. Why? Because the original $100 came from the creation of wealth equal to that, and I transformed that $100 into something that is now only worth $80. Literally, wealth was destroyed.<p>If you'd like a more concrete analogy, what Microsoft did is a lot like taking a a 1 carat diamond and smashing it into diamond dust. Only the arrangement of matter has changed, but in terms of wealth, the diamond dust is worth far less than the sparkling 1 carat diamond.<p>It's the same with the $100. As a $100 bill, it is worth exactly $100. Microsoft took that $100 and spend it on labor and materials. The matter in the world stayed the same. But the new arrangement of matter (an Xbox) was only worth $80 to the world. Microsoft destroyed $20 in wealth to the world.<p>This, in a nutshell, is what Microsoft did with the Xbox. Sony was doing something the world wanted with the Playstation. They were literally spending $100 and getting $120 in value out of it. That's what wealth creation looks like.<p>Microsoft did the opposite. Even worse, they did so in order to make it impossible for Sony to create wealth, too. In my book, reducing the wealth of the world for something so stupid, so small, as to ""eliminate competition"" is about the worst sin a business can do.<p>The literally billions of dollars of wealth destroyed at both Sony and Microsoft by the behavior of Microsoft has hurt the world in enumerable ways. For all we know, had the money been returned to shareholders, we may have made more progress on green energy. Or food production. Or water purification. Or cancer research. Or any of the other things we could have done instead of destroying wealth.<p>That is why the OP is so off base. And why the rest of you should upvote my comment like crazy. Wealth destruction is bad, full stop.",1292602420

But this is largely irrelevant because the chances are high that the snake in front of you has not been sampled uniformly from the distribution of all snakes. A lot of factors dictate the statistical make up of a snake that one may encounter and its aggression level. Geography, weather and time of the year play an important role.<p>Let me give an anecdotal example. My college has a reputation with snakes, so much so that pea-cocks were artificially introduced to control their population. I would hazard a conservative guess that 50% of all students encounter a snake in close proximity every year. These are almost always a cobra, krait or local species of a viper. All extremely poisonous. Nonetheless in the entire history of the institution there has not been a single instance of a snake bite, and they have actually stopped stocking on anti-venom.<p>But unless you are trained to handle snakes, picking them up is certainly not wise and my prior would be high that she did not have such a training.",1292602195

2016590,comment,2015176,2016156,0,0,elblanco,,,"As someone with a CS background who has worked with several very talented self-taught programmers in the past I can echo this. Even if they knew a particular language or environment better than I did, I could usually write faster or more efficient code simply because of my deeper knowledge of data structures.<p>One in particular comes to mind, I was working a temp job during my 3rd year at college with a very talented friend who was self-taught. He had written a rather brilliant dynamic reporting system for a very large e-commerce site in Perl, allowing the management to interactively drill down into recent sales and inventory activity. It worked fine for a few years until the volume of data became very large. Try as he might he couldn't get the software to be performant any longer and had to resort to a 10-11 <i>hour</i> batch crunch every night with the output dumped out to static HTML files for the mgmt to review. Finally one night, the process failed -- out of memory. Throwing more hardware at it only bought another few days.<p>A dive into his code (most of which was really quite well done) turned up the following: he was using Perl hashes <i>everywhere</i> to operate on the data because they made the code easy to read and convenient to write and maintain. I rewrote many of the particularly inefficient parts to use arrays over a few weeks and suddenly, the entire batch took 10 minutes to run! A few more tweaks and we turned it off of batch mode and back into full interactive mode. Mgmt never had to wait more than a minute or two to return back a report of a huge amount of data.<p>The key of course was that he simply didn't understand how much overhead the associative arrays created because he didn't understand the data-structures involved. He had simply relied on the magic of the language to do that work for him. A few days spent with <a href=""http://blob.perl.org/tpc/1998/Perl_Language_and_Modules/Perl%20Illustrated/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blob.perl.org/tpc/1998/Perl_Language_and_Modules/Perl...</a> and he never made that mistake again.",1292602084

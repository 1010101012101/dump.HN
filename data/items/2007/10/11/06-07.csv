The founders have been developing the site in PHP using a framework the founder cooked up himself (not a full-fledged MVC job like Symphony or Rails, though).<p>I took a look at the codebase today, and (at least to me) it seems incredibly messy.<p>Am I too accustomed to working in a Rails-like environment or should I seriously suggest that we rewrite all the code in Symphony or Rails?<p>I think I could do the whole thing myself in a couple days, so it wouldn't be a HUGE deal.<p>Your opinions much appreciated. Thanks.",1192083325

Here's Tom Wolfe on the culture of the places the founders of Silicon Valley came from: <p>""Back East, engineers, no matter how gifted, ranked below doctors, lawyers, Army colonels, Navy captains, business executives, and professors of English, history, biology, chemistry, and physics. This piece of European snobbery never reached Grinnell, however, nor did it turn up in many of the thousands of small towns in the Midwest and the Far West. An extremely bright student, the one possessing the quality known as genius, was infinitely more likely to go into engineering in Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, or Wisconsin than anywhere Back East.""<p>That's from this: <a href=""http://members.forbes.com/asap/1997/0825/102.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://members.forbes.com/asap/1997/0825/102.html</a> .

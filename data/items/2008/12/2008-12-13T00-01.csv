My plan was to add my server's SMTP info in an SPF compatible way (still don't know how to do this part.)<p>3 - use a service (mailchimp etc.) for newsletters.<p>Can someone expand on this thinking?

Why not assume that in the future they'll harness the universe's full computational capabilities and emulate every single being that has ever lived?  If cryonics is possible, the simulation scenario is just as possible, since it uses the exact same assumptions.  Plus, it is a lot cheaper to believe in:)",1229129721
396325,comment,396218,396218,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"For a long time I've maintained that Apple's position on system access and background process APIs was purely political - in that there is no technical or security/privacy reasons for 3rd party apps being locked out - just Jobs' control-freak personality. Both Android and BlackBerry allow such access to 3rd party apps and it makes a whole lot more stuff possible than on the iPhone.<p>My own little Android app (<a href=""http://phonalyzr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phonalyzr.com</a>) is another example. Rather than background processing, it needs access to contact/call log info. On Android and BlackBerry the OS notifies the user the app will access that and the user can make a decision, on the iPhone that decision has been made for the user by Jobs.<p>When people start to see stuff like Loopt working better on Android or similarly open devices and when none of Jobs' scare tactics (malicious apps, viruses bringing down networks etc) come to pass, perhaps the iPhone will open up a bit more.",1229129682

Every time you bid you extend the auction, therefore if you're willing to pay the most you will win.

396320,comment,396052,396232,0,0,yters,,,"Pascal's argument is fallacious because it equivocates between actual possibility and logical possibility.  You are making the same fallacy, even given your shaky assumptions.<p>Another issue is that the idea of revival doesn't even make logical sense.  What happens when two bodies with the same construction are revived?  Which one has my consciousness?<p>Or think about it like this: an exact replicant of my body has been revived while I'm still alive.  Obviously, the revived body does not have the same consciousness, since I didn't suddenly become conscious of living in two bodies or a different body.  Why would this change by delaying revival until after I'm dead?  And if it doesn't, why should I care?<p>So, I don't really see the case for cryonics.  It seems to be flawed on both practical and logical grounds.",1229129211

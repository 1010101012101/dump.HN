They own and control what I assume to be the most popular clients on every major platform (iOS, Android WinPhone, Mac, and, now that they own Tweetdeck, Windows). The whole point of the ""don't make any new clients"" announcement was to communicate their desire to control the user experience (i.e. the clients) for the majority of Twitter users, so I'd be surprised if they felt the need to discourage third-party developers further.",1312019987

2825377,comment,2825177,2825177,0,0,babebridou,,,"This situation is in fact a very understandable vendetta of the unfortunate victim towards the rest of the world - and she is right - everyone should pay for what she suffered. The actual word is compassion, and there's never enough of it in the whole world for any single unfortunate person.<p>With that said, no company with AirBnB's business model can publicly say they will assist victims whatever the cost. It's just impossible. It would be a blatant lie. They must at least maintain some sort of windshield against insurance frauds, and doing that requires tons of hard PR and legal decisions to be made, and the assistance of lawyers. And everyone hates lawyers. Companies are sometimes inherently good, sometimes not, but they should never be inherently so stupid as to sign their own commercial/financial/legal doom. You can get up from bad PR, but you can't get up from bankrupcy.<p>Now after this argument in favor of an actual public silence, let's see what we have:
1) a victim
2) there is no 2. There is a victim and that's all.<p>Just fix the victim. No need to go through internet flamewars or PR messes, no need to even listen to that. Airbnb should just send a team of 24/7 dedicated people with quasi carte blanche (within what the company can afford, of course) to see through that victim gets better, if that objective can even be met. If the ""get better"" project goes so wrong as to lead to law suits or whatnot, then let justice decide, because in the end, yes, someone has to pay for what happened, and the legal system is here to decide who should pay.<p>Now about PR: switch the debate from a ""what did AirBnB do in that situation"" witch-hunt to ""This is what we are doing, this is how it's going from our point of view, now what do you (Mr/Mrs Customer) think we could improve on?"". Open a public discussion on your social network and dedicate someone to analyze public input. And use it the next time something like this happens (because unfortunately, it will happen again). Centralize this debate somewhere where you can handle all this information, and by ""handle"" I don't mean ""censor"" but of course ""assimilate"".<p>...and just ignore those stupid emergent flame wars between big internet guns who are mostly in for pride (white knights & trolls) and money (journalists, consultants, lobbyists & investors). Let them deal with the crap they fling around themselves, and keep focusing on the ""get better"" project: the victim asked specifically for your help, and that's what really matters here.<p>Related link: an analysis of an excellent online PR crisis management by Monoprix (in French only, sorry) <a href=""http://guybirenbaum.blogitexpress.com/91728/html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guybirenbaum.blogitexpress.com/91728/html</a>
The ""victim"" (an employee who got fired for taking home unsold & trashed goods) explained that he ""tried hard to make a fuss and a buzz"" of his situation because he felt that nothing short of prosecution and trial could make him feel better. This is a case of a failing ""get better"" project with exemplary PR - and to be honest, it's only when the project fails that PR become important. What did Monoprix do? They centralized the debate on their Facebook page,  switched the focus from ""Monoprix is bad"" to a laconic ""here's what we are doing, tell us what we can improve on"" and they have dedicated Community Managers assimilating and discussing the comments instead of censoring them.",1312018659

That is, how does this help against the fact that Android has:<p>* A much more complex set of (good!) abstractions that are poorly documented;<p>* and, if I might add alongside the OP, requires a much higher workload in terms of code length and complexity, debugging, device configuration management and tools for what seems to be a much lower payoff?<p>I have a successful iOS app out, and I tried to rearchitect it in a manageable way to port it on Android. What I found out is:<p>* The code would be roughly twice as much as the iOS version.<p>* A proper UI effort would require roughly 2.5x work than the iOS version, as I need to prep up a flexible layout that will work on phones (the buckets 'small' to 'large'), and then another for tablets (actually up to two: 'xlarge' and Honeycomb, which may require some rethinking to accommodate the new action bar). Contrast this to two, fixed-size layouts for the iOS version.<p>* I already have a path for implementing backgrounding on iOS and it requires minimal change to account for services not available while backgrounded; otherwise, code is exactly the same. On Android, I would have to plan for it from the beginning and set up very poorly documented IBinder stuff to have my Activities talk to a background Service.<p>* The general unwillingness of Android users in the face of paid apps, and a use model that does not lend itself easily to the insertion of ads, would make my (more costly) effort go unpaid.<p>I must admit I have never used resources other than developer.android.com and Google, and the latter didn't help me as much as (as little as) developer.android.com did.

2825327,comment,2825177,2825261,6,0,bugsy,,,"I agree with you that is a smart approach.<p>I think the reason they don't do anything to really fix it rather than lip service and lawyer wrangling and dirty PR tricks is they are afraid of setting a precedent. However, they should have thought that through a bit more. They are saying they've had a million rentals or some such with no incident. If that is true, covering someone's damage for the 1 in a million case should be something they can do. Let's say it costs $10,000. That's nothing compared to their profit for those million cases where it didn't happen. By not doing this they are sending several possible messages. One is that they believe that a lot more robberies are going to happen and they have been lucky so far. It's not going to be 1 in a million it's going to be 1 in a 100, and they can't afford to fix 1% of all stays that turn into robberies. This message also means they believe it is impossible to fix, they give up on the idea of ever being able to truly identify renters (the rentees are not as big an issue to identify since their names are on the deeds). I think that's crazy since it's really obvious they have been severely legally negligent in not actually acquiring real identities of renters, though they have certainly implied to rentees that it was safe as if they had. That's probably going to end up being determined by some court or consumer advocacy agency like the FTC to be a misrepresentation. The other bad message they send with this is that if they truly believe it is 1 in a million and they don't want to help her out by finding a place to stay and fixing her apartment, then they are obscenely greedy. There are costs to doing this sort of business after all, you can't just starve the business and take it all for yourself. Some money needs to be set aside for these sorts of 100% predictable and inevitable occurrences.<p>Whoever is on their hack legal team is should be fired and they should get some real lawyers in there. Obviously they are obsessed with CYA and avoiding responsibility. If that is where they want to be fine but then they have no business running this sort of business. This business is going to have robberies, rapes and murders from time to time. They should have had a plan. Yelling ""it's not our fault"", threatening the victim, playing the hypocrite, and attacking people who reasonably comment on the story (and through a third party, what cowards) is absolutely not the right approach. What you mentioned is pretty good though, but it's pretty clear that was brought up and dismissed as something that might cost a couple hundred bucks they were too greedy to let go of.",1312016475

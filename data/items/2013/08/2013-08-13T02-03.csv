Most folks working in the language have no idea that it could possibly exist outside of Apple and tend to think of all the framework underneath them as a black box.  I think maybe some of these folks would learn something by looking at an open source re-implementation of these NS* classes, or attempting such an endeavor themselves, even if on a small scale.<p>Also: objc is just too interesting for Apple to hog it all for themselves, or for it to be a one-implementation language.",1376362376

6203736,story,,,5,3,alberts,"Malware attack on multiple websites ",,"Malware attack on multiple websites<p>I develop and keep track of a few websites that are hosted on various providers.
Recently, two of my websites, hosted by different companies got hit by malware.
Since the hosts don&#x27;t want to help out in tracing the attacker and I don&#x27;t have root access to the machines I know very little about the origin of the attack.
It&#x27;s a code injection attack inserting some javascript code into your .html files and index files.
The code starts with an html comment and &quot;0f2490&quot;. If you see something like that in your files delete it and look through all of them.
The easiest way to do that is to grep for &quot;0f2490&quot;.
You can use the following command in linux to search through all your files for that string.<p>find . -type f -exec grep -inH &quot;0f2490&quot; {} \;<p>If anyone has any information regarding this type of attack, it would be muchly appreciated.
The malware seems to be pretty new.
Upon notifying one of the hosting providers, I was told that the site was scanned and it is malware-free, which of course was not the case.
Microsoft only has noticed it on 08/08/2013, so 4 days ago.
Of course I take all the precautions when developing, all my passwords are strong.
My development machine is only used for development, and a full scan is ran each night.
So i hope the breach was not due to my shortcomings.<p>If you have any information please post it here on Hacker News.
Thank you.",1376362317

In this current climate, your lack of a college degree will not affect your hiring chances. Blue chip tech companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook care slightly more, but even then, four years of quality work experience will actually, in my opinion, put you ahead. I get the feeling that when people on this thread talk about HR, they are talking about the job recruiting processes at other non Goog/Apple/Msft/Amz/Fb firms that are not as software-focused. Those firms in my experience are a lot more meritocratic. I didn&#x27;t have a college education when my resume got through Apple&#x27;s recruiter filter, and when I got an in-person interview with Amazon.<p>2. However, the current job climate in SV is quite unique. The job market is so hot that, as you can see in the linked thread, people with 1 year of experience can get 120k job offers as web/mobile developers (take into account that SV is very expensive to live in). The central question is: what is the job market going to look like in the future? If the market crashes in the next 2 years, not only will you have a hard time finding a job, but so will even those with CS degrees (by no means am I saying that those with CS degrees will be ahead in that case).<p>3. I think there is a good chance of you getting a summer internship in the coming summer. Do you have any family in the Bay Area that you could stay with? Make sure it is a paid internship - unpaid internships are generally correlated with low quality.<p>4. There are other non-tangible reasons to go to school: the social experience, meeting girls (or guys), etc. If you&#x27;re a 18/19 year-old guy it can be quite hard to date in SV working at a startup, esp. since everyone your age is in school. It&#x27;s for this reason that I chose to go to school.<p>5. <i>Consider a compromise (see linked thread):</i> Get a great internship over the summer, preferably with a well-known startup or tech company. Do well and ask for a full-time offer, which will allow you to bypass the normal interview process. Defer admission to UT Austin for 1 year (a so-called gap year, you&#x27;ll have to look into their admissions policies more closely or contact the admissions office to see if that is allowed - also see what kind of deadline you have for declaring that you&#x27;re deferring).

In fact, &quot;unlikely&quot; is a mild word for just how unlikely it is to succeed.<p>Problem #1 - No clear value demonstration to the end user.  The video is... not very good.  The primary reason it&#x27;s not very good is because it&#x27;s asking people to read.  People react instinctively to faces, to the sound of a person&#x27;s voice, and to feeling connected with them.  It&#x27;s no coincidence that virtually every successful Kickstarter campaign contains monologues by their campaign creators.  Thus, while there may be a value proposition embedded somewhere in the video, it&#x27;s probably lost on most people who watch it because they just aren&#x27;t really identifying with what is being presented.<p>Problem #2 - a $25 minimum price point.  The gamedev industry has repeatedly proven that by enabling people to contribute $5 and $10, you reap about 20-40% more income than you otherwise would have.  This truth isn&#x27;t restricted to the domain of gamedev.  The evidence for this is that virtually every successful Kickstarter project has low-tier contribution levels, often contributing a significant amount to the bottom-line of projects that aren&#x27;t going to deliver a tangible product.  E.g. this may not be so important for projects like Soylent, where the end-user will receive something tangible, but it&#x27;s pretty important for most projects that weren&#x27;t set up with the goal of taking preorders.<p>Problem #3 - Too high of a threshold for funding.  $50k is not reasonable when the value proposition is so unclear.  I could see this project reaching $5k or maybe even $10k.  But it&#x27;s not reasonable to calculate how much it would cost you to work on it, and then use that as the funding goal.  &quot;What would the crowds be willing to pay?&quot; takes priority over &quot;How much would this cost me in terms of my time, and what is my time worth?&quot;",1376360050

If you have single digit numbers of heavy users in the entire country then you can amortize that cost over millions of people and it will be minimal. If you have millions of heavy users then the all you can eat plan will cost more as it ought to.<p>> And speaking of markets, what about the demand for low-cost, high-burst but transfer-limited connections?<p>So we&#x27;re getting back to the real problem here. The problem is that number of bits transferred is monumentally disconnected from the overall cost of operating a network. It costs the same amount to dig a hole to put a wire in regardless of the number of wires you put in it or the number of bits they ultimately carry, and <i>that</i> is the predominant cost of being able to transfer bits. Guys in trucks digging holes for wires and putting them back on the poles when the weather knocks them down. Paying for land taken through eminent domain. Employee compensation, property insurance, backup generators, idle power consumption, equipment depreciation. They&#x27;re all fixed costs that don&#x27;t change with the number of bits you transfer and they dominate the cost of operating a network.<p>So now you have a pricing problem. There are a couple of different &quot;straight&quot; pricing models. The first is you charge everybody a fixed monthly fee and let them transfer whatever they want. Someone who only transfers 50MB per month is still getting the benefit of men in trucks fixing downed wires 24/7 and access to the call center for support etc. etc., so they have to pay their fair share of that, which dominates the cost of the network and makes flat rate pricing sensible. The fact that they don&#x27;t transfer very many bits doesn&#x27;t make it any less expensive to dig up their street.<p>The second alternative is to charge exclusively by the byte. This is a preposterous failure. The problem is that, because the people who only transfer 50MB per month would be paying approximately zero dollars, but you still have to cover the cost of the line workers and accountants that service them, the cost per byte would have to be extremely high so that the heavy users pay enough to make up for the light users paying almost nothing. And this immediately snowballs because 90% of the heavy users aren&#x27;t going to continue to be heavy users if they have to pay $2000/month to make up for twenty light users paying $5/month, so they turn into light users and then the price per byte has to go up to make up the revenue. Repeat until the price per byte is so high that even the light users are back to paying ~$50/month again but now you&#x27;ve destroyed the market for any services that require a significant amount of bandwidth and your customers hate you for charging a dollar for an email attachment.<p>So you can&#x27;t charge solely by the byte, why not come up with some hybrid of the two and try to thread the needle? Charge a fixed monthly fee for turning on the pipe and then charge a &quot;reasonable&quot; amount for transfer on top of that. The fail is <i>how much</i>. The cost of putting twice or ten times as many strands of fiber in the ground when you already have the hole open is negligible compared to the other costs of operating the network. If you allocate based on that cost then the price per GB is going to be in the fractions of a penny. The pricing model ends up being de facto equivalent to a fixed monthly fee because the additional cost per byte would be so low.<p>But this is looking at all of this like a regulator -- someone who wants to maximize social utility. That&#x27;s not what ISPs actually want to do. They don&#x27;t want to put a hundred stands of fiber in the ground, even if it only costs 1% more in total than putting ten, because it eliminates &quot;valuable&quot; scarcity and reduces their ability to engage in price discrimination. Enterprise customers are willing to pay a lot more for the exact same piece of wire than a residential customer because the enterprise gets more value out of it and has more money. That has nothing to do with the cost of providing the service and everything to do with who has deep pockets. So they come up with a pricing model that will stick it to the enterprise and extract the $XXXX/month the enterprise is willing to pay, hence &quot;no servers&quot; and transfer caps etc. etc. because enterprises want to run servers and transfer a lot of data. Not because it costs the ISP that much more, but because that class of customers is expected to have more money.<p>That isn&#x27;t what you want from a policy perspective at all, because the price discrimination is too blunt. Small businesses are less able to pay the &quot;enterprise&quot; rates so you drive them out of business in favor of larger companies. Software developers who want to encourage end users to run things that would be considered &quot;servers&quot; or would transfer a large amount of data get pushed out of the market because their customers on residential connections aren&#x27;t allowed to do it. Meanwhile users are uselessly encouraged to &quot;conserve&quot; bandwidth even though unused hardware capacity can&#x27;t actually be saved for use later, which wastefully reduces the benefit users receive from their connections. (The fact that <i>not</i> using unused transfer capacity is wasteful is hard for some people to wrap their heads around, but think about it. It&#x27;s like &quot;saving&quot; perishable food by not eating it before it expires.)<p>Even if you like the idea of enterprises paying more than residential customers, distorting the market like this is not the way to do it. You could get a much better result by e.g. taxing telecommunications usage by corporations with more than 1000 employees and then using the money to subsidize connections for everybody else.",1376359500

County would say no to the train if allowed to vote on it again; 37 percent would be in favor. In San Francisco the train would win 47-45.<p>About 66 percent of Central Valley voters were opposed to the train, which would run through their farm region.<p>Statewide, if a re-vote on the train were allowed, 59 percent of would-be voters would say no; only 33 percent would give reaffirm it.<p>About 55 percent of statewide voters said they&#x27;d be down for a re-vote.</i><p>The article later goes on to state:<p><i>The biggest problem for this train is timing -- California is facing another crushing budget deficit and a stalling economic recovery. Dan Schnur, director of the poll:<p><pre><code>    Californians aren&#x27;t necessarily against the idea of high-speed rail. But they don&#x27;t want to spend all that money right now, and they don&#x27;t trust the state to make the trains run on time.</code></pre>

This loophole allows local agencies to get paid for letting private corporations get tax deductions that they should not be getting. I may be totally off base here, but near as I can tell the correct market-based solution is probably not to make this illegal (although that probably can&#x27;t hurt) but to give local agencies like BART the ability to file tax deductions in the same way the private enterprise doing the LILO is. This would remove the incentive to perform a LILO since the local agency would be gaining short term liquidity in the form of &quot;tax returns&quot;, assuming their they can deduct taxes beyond the $0 taxes they owe by virtue of being a government institution.",1376359219

I think it might help if I built a demonstration article. I think I probably will do that, actually. Ive sort of come around in my thinking on that part.<p>- For now, this is a low priority for Musk. Maybe I would just do the beginning bit, create a subscale version that is operating and then hand it over to someone else. Ironing out the details at a subscale level is a tricky thing. I think I would probably end up doing that. It just wont be immediate in the short term because I have to focus on Tesla and SpaceX execution.<p>- If it was his first priority, he could have it done in a year. The demonstration project would not be anything that required some sort of big government approval process, he said.<p>- Musk will invest his own money into this project, even though he hopes others will help as well. I always invest my own money in the companies that I create. I dont believe in the whole thing of just using other peoples money. I dont think thats right. Im not going to ask other people to invest in something if Im not prepared to do so myself.<p>- But its okay if it doesnt make him a lot of money. Im not trying to make a ton of money on this but I would like to see it come to fruition, he said. I dont really care much one way or another if I have any economic benefit or another, but it would be cool to see an alternate form of transport.</i><p>It&#x27;a not clear whether Musk actually said he intends to build a proof of concept or whether the writer took his &quot;probably&quot; too far.<p>If anyone finds a more complete transcript of the teleconference, please post it.",1376359200

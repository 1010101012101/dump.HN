The frequencies that disrupt circadian rhythm are 500nm to 450nm or so with the strongest response at 470nm. Response is also dependent on duration and ambient light levels, so if you are in the dark, as much as 0.5 lux of blue light over an hour can halt your pineal gland from producing melatonin.<p>F.lux also shouldn&#x27;t be relied upon by itself. How well it works is dependent on the particular frequencies emitted by the RGB components of your screen. I have a 470nm band pass filter that I look at light emitters through, and f.lux reduces such emitters, but doesn&#x27;t stop them completely. I have constructed a removable orange filter as a supplement.",1387727992

I understand that tone matters in regards to reception, but in this place i assume we all, grammar nazis and privilege checkers alike, choose to asses the technical aspects of comments and largely disregard the &quot;gift wrap&quot;. In this situation, the problem with Telegram is their words right big checks their work cannot cash. The TextSecure chaps are defending their turf viciously, but i have yet to see one of them make a personal assessment as the predicate for their assault. I have been following it very closely, comment wise, and all it has really been is long winded explanations (on the TextSecure side) of why the Telegram contest was a sham (it was) and why TextSecure is better (i have no way to judge). On the other side (Telegram), all i see are pleas to leave the Telegram guys alone, hate toward Moxie et al., and general pseudo-martyr comments about how mean Hacker News is.<p>Good. Let&#x27;s be hard to please. This is not [spoiler]fucking[/spoiler] macaroni paintings we are making and using to please mommy. These are the apps we all use to continue our work and edify our lives. I want it to be a gauntlet; i think it is great that people&#x27;s products are critiqued so meticulously, and i am happy that a competition with such glaring inconsistencies (to whomever wrote the alternate competition explanation...thank you)did not survive for long. As an American, i am so tired of security theater.

Range prop is not the only solution.<p>Use JIT techniques to speculate profitably that most ints fit in JS doubles. This can be done in JS-hosted VMs, just as in machine-code-generating native VMs.<p>Again, this is extremely old hat to the Dart/V8 folks. See, e.g.<p><a href=\"http://mraleph.tumblr.com/post/24351748336/explaining-js-vm-in-js\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mraleph.tumblr.com/post/24351748336/explaining-js-vm-...</a><p>In SpiderMonkey, we augment JIT techniques with online type inference that distinguishes int from double. The same type inference could add bignum to the speculative tower. See<p><a href=\"http://rfrn.org/~shu/drafts/ti.pdf\u200E\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://rfrn.org/~shu/drafts/ti.pdf\u200E</a><p>This avoids most of those checks that you <i>assume</i> are too expensive (and by assuming, so casually fork Dart semantics).<p>Here is a JS version of [Hackett&Shu, PLDI 2012], from @pcwalton:<p><a href=\"https://github.com/pcwalton/doctorjsmm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/pcwalton/doctorjsmm/</a><p>Can the full JIT+TI approach to bignum/double/int perform well enough for dart2js? Better find out, because forking semantics is just the wrong thing.<p>Another road not taken: we hear &quot;can&#x27;t wait for JS to get better&quot;, but Dart started at least by 2010, possibly earlier.<p><a href=\"http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:bignums\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:bignums</a><p>could have been proposed and actually worked into ES6 by now, but the Dart team was in stealth mode (Dash) for too long.

About the URL from shapado.com I mentioned above, which had its length capped: If you have to limit the length of the URL (or any text string in general), try doing it at word boundaries to reduce the chances of disrupting the meaning of the text. In the title mentioned above, ""Source"" became ""sour"".<p>Think about what happens to ""I saw him beating that assassin"" if an application decided to cap the string to 26 characters to fit an URL, for example.<p>Breaking between words reduces the chances of these accidents happening. Sometimes it is not possible (the title is a single big word, or in a language without spaces), in which cases you may want to degrade to the normal slicing.",1280375701

(I chose an industry where the standard price to sell is, well, silly low.)  If you sell an ISP, I am told, the going rate is a year's revenue plus the value of your equipment.  Considering that I'm doubling every six months or so, that just seems silly, and I suspect that lower price is in part because i'd pay half as much taxes if I sell the company all at once than if I keep it long enough to pay myself that much in salary.<p>still, I think capital gains being lower than salary taxes encourages short-term thinking, and gives publicly traded companies an unfair advantage over the rest of us.",1280374995

He says that products like productivity tools represent an investment to the potential consumer: 'buy me now, for a high upfront cost, and I will help you become more productive (aka help you make more money) in the future'.

Are there counter-examples to this? Or conditions where this is simply not true? His argument relies on the fact that 37signals 'charge a lot', and that this high price is not translatable to other web services. But there's no way to quantify that. And there's no reason to assume that there aren't other reasons for such willingness to pay. Off the top of my head: people pay more because 37signals is a strong, trustworthy brand. People pay more because this is B2B, and business have to tend to buy things only at a certain (high) price. People pay more because they have large teams, and 37signals's tiered pricing forces them to use the more expensive packages.",1280374375

1556500,comment,1556056,1556056,0,0,rdl,,,"For a couple years, I've worked for a company founded by an MD ~20 years ago, doing PACS (Radiology IT system; basically how X-Rays and CTs and MRIs get distributed within a hospital, viewed by doctors, archived, and sent between sites; my particular client is the US military in Iraq/Afghanistan/Kuwait/etc.).  The founder is an MD (Ortho), but I don't think he's ever practiced medicine.  I would probably say he's a better businessman than 99% of the MDs I've met, but probably would have been a worse doctor.<p>Generally, the perception of MDs in business, especially outside medical startups, is that they're horrible.  First, they're usually convinced they're the smartest in the room, and even if they may be, that they're also the most knowledgeable about any given domain -- even if they have no idea about it.  They often end up involved in mediocre small businesses, taken advantage of in scams, etc., due to being rich and bad at business.<p>They're also super-expensive; education and debt.  The best are probably military doctors who leave after their first tour, but even then, they're mid/late 30s.<p>Within medicine, having an MD as the medical interface of your company (could be CEO, could be bizdev, could just be a chief medical officer) is essential.  One of the factors limiting medical IT startups is that they're really just IT startups with some additional hassle, but the pool of suitable MDs willing to work in a startup is low.<p>I think there are a lot of great opportunities in medicine: the PACS/Telemedicine field is open (especially for consumer-facing systems, or for SaaS); various forms of automation (pharmacy, EHR/EMR, lab, etc.) exist, but generally have been developed by large companies and aren't as well engineered as one would like, or as innovative -- the long product cycle, conservative buyers, and FDA regulations slow this, but the effect is greater than this can explain.  Probably the best opportunity for disruptive innovation is direct, consumer-facing health, especially in less or unregulated areas.  Scott Adams (Dilbert)'s idea of passively monitoring one's daily life, then when you get sick, go back and look at the previous N months of data archive and identify causes or lifestyle issues; then do statistical analysis across people, is one idea.  Providing better realtime advice and decision support about things with health impact (diet, exercise, various drugs, ...).<p>I guess the most relevant question is about you -- aside from liking HN/TechCrunch, and being an MD, are you someone who wants to code?  Work on hardware?  Business?  Do you like quick/simple projects, well-funded low risk big projects, or true startups?  Are you location-specific at all?<p>If it were me, if I didn't have 100% answers, I would probably try to intern or contract/consult with a variety of companies or projects, just to get a feel for how they work.  Founding a startup is a 5-10 year project, so spending a year figuring out exactly what kind of startup, or if you want to do a startup at all, is probably worthwhile.<p>My next project is actually an IT infrastructure thing, which has healthcare and defense as primary markets.",1280373211

1556478,comment,1556032,1556234,0,0,jfr,,,"1. Not allowing two questions with the same title is yet another design issue, not a feature. Avoid making unique indexes on every field unnecessarily. Lets call it problem ""3"" then, I'll go back shortly to it.<p>Back to problem 1, if you use the normalized title as your primary key, you will have to map this key to the tuple, value or document stored in the database. The title of a question is supposed to be a free-form textual redaction written by the user to express his/her inquiry or idea. It can be arbitrarily short or long. You will probably have to set a low limit to it, because you don't want people dumping kilobytes of text in the title, but it also can't be too short, otherwise people won't be able to express themselves. Is the maximum length chosen for the title of a question appropriate also for the primary key of your table?<p>In order to be a primary key, the database has to compare the entire key against an index of keys present in the table. If all N characters are part of the key, it means that this lookup is O(N) on average (just transversing the key, plus the index lookup itself), because it has to consider the whole string. Compare with O(1) of an unique numeric identifier.<p>But you then say that you can hash the original key and use the hash result to lookup the index in O(1). Yes, but hashes are not unique. Two different strings may result in the same hash. The index has to consider that any key may contain multiple tuples, in a bucket or in a linked list, or something else. An additional O(N) compare is necessary to recheck that you indeed got the right result or some other result which happens to have the same hash.<p>But you then say that you will limit the size of the key in the db indexing. Still not good. This doesn't work well since the key comes from the title, and the title is free-form text entered by the user. If you limit to, say, 64 characters, what if two users type two similar but different questions with only the last characters differing?<p>So, it is much more work either to your app or to your database to use a big key instead of a short unique id. It means that if your app which would be able to handle 1000 reqs/sec with short unique ids, it ends up handling only around 200 reqs/sec using big primary keys (depending on how big is the key, the hashing function used, etc). This is the bottleneck.<p>If it grows and you hit some hardware limits, and then you think about load balancing, it also means that you will have to implement the same costly algorithms on the load balancers. The load balancers will have to hash your URLs in order to decide to which DB cluster to redirect the request, while if it had a short unique ID it would be extremely easy for the load balancer to perform the distribution based on the that ID.<p>And then, long URLs. Long URLs are terrible, in many, many ways. While analyzing the sites, I found conflicting results about what Shapado does with long URLs. In shapado.com they seem to be capped, while in ubuntu.shapado.com they are not:<p><a href=""http://shapado.com/questions/besides-shapado-which-other-qa-open-sour"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shapado.com/questions/besides-shapado-which-other-qa-...</a><p><a href=""http://ubuntu.shapado.com/questions/what-s-the-most-well-integrated-monitoring-solution-on-ubuntu-zenoss-zabbix-or-cacti-+nagios"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ubuntu.shapado.com/questions/what-s-the-most-well-int...</a><p>I don't know why the difference (different versions or configuration?). Anyways, you will find that people will copy-paste these URLs into their broken e-mail programs, which will arbitrarily break the URLs in all different lengths varying from 68 to 80 characters. If you use the entire length of the URL as your key, you immediately have a problem. If you decide to consider only the first N characters as your key, then you go back to the other problem above about two questions with only the last characters different. It is much better to have the short unique ID earlier in the URL. In this case, if the latter part is missing, the app uses the ID and either ignore the rest or send a 302 redirect with the correct URL.<p>Finally, the normalization takes out some characters from the title, most notably punctuation. I haven't tested, but the immediate question is: What if the user asks ""どのようにケーキを焼くために？"" ?<p>Now you open a real can of worms. If normalization considers only ASCII alphanumeric, the key generated by this title is empty. If normalization considers Unicode, you it may have to handle different Unicode normal forms. You will have even more issues with the URL being copy-pasted around in different broken applications. It will also overflow faster when percent-encoding the URL, because each CKJ character expands to up to three UTF-8 octets, and each octet expands to three bytes after percent-encoding. So a single ""焼"" is becomes 9 bytes long in an URL.<p>Enough of point number one? Next...<p>2. Then, what happens user asks ""What is Unix?"" and then he explains the question and it becomes clear that what he really wanted to know was about Linux, and the question is changed to ""What is Linux?"". (At this point, you will have two different keys pointing to the same document). After that, someone else comes and asks again ""What is Unix?"", now with a different meaning of ""Unix""? What happens? How does it degrade to the point-of-view of the user?<p>Also, now, knowing how the system works (as you explained), anyone could go there and exploit all the short titles to create permanent redirects to their favorite questions. Just go there and ask ""k"", then change the question to anything else that is perhaps useful (for a spammer, for example). Now that guy ""earned"" the /question/k short URL for his product or his biased question.<p>3. Not allowing two questions with the same title based on your feeling that such cases will not exist is like saying that you will make a persons birth timestamp an unique index because you never saw two people who where born at the same date and the same time. Again, the title is a free-form textual redaction from the user. You may not see with the limited scope that Shapado has today, but what about future uses? What about different languages with a more limited vocabulary that doesn't allow much expressiveness, and question clashes are more common? In fact, it is not necessary to go that far. Lets keep it in technical computing English. For example, one user asks:<p><pre><code>    ""What is ASP?""
</code></pre>
Is he asking about Active Server Pages? Or perhaps Auxiliary Storage Pool? Maybe Application Service Provider or even AppleTalk Session Protocol? Ok, you can edit the question to reflect one of these many meanings, but it is still an unnecessary burden on the users. Again, how does it degrade if users hit this limitation?<p>The ultimate question is: do you really need to create such an artificial limitation in your application, with so little information about its real-world uses (since the project is very recent)?<p>Well, that is it.<p>Please, don't get me wrong. It is great to see such a project being born. I'm always happy to see the open-source community growing and evolving. Take this as a constructive criticism. All these points raised above are really things that should have been considered in the design phase of the project, not after it is deployed.",1280372721

Ask the developer to simply say what the access will be used for? In an malicious app, they'd obviously just lie. Short of actually displaying what data an app is sending, I don't see an easy answer.</i><p>maybe show a list of domains it's allowed to resolve/contact?  i guess that wouldn't make it any easier for most users to decipher though.  i think a lot of free apps require network access just to download ads; maybe there is a better way (in the android api) of handling that to segment it away from full-blown network access?<p>maybe have a set of permissions common to each category?  it's expected that a web browser app has access to do a lot of things, but if you have an app in a wallpaper category that requires those same set of permissions, it should be raising a red flag somewhere.<p>perhaps apple's app review process wasn't so crazy after all...",1280372639

I've seen similar results in my own tests, with the right mix of trust logos adding 5-10% to conversion rate.<p>It's amazing how much the little trust boosting tidbits can improve conversions. I once boosted conversions for an email submit over 20% just by adding a little picture of a lock(completely meaningless and arbitrary!) next to the email field.",1280372619

I still preordered this Kindle because:<p>1) The active area on the iPad screen is a giant pain.  Any touch ends up triggering... something, and when I'm reading I tend to shift around quite a bit.  It's amazing how often I unintentionally bring up menus, change pages, etc.<p>2) Lighter is better.  The weight of the iPad makes it a little ungainly for reading.  The Kindle is easily held in one hand.<p>3) Better page changes: I can read the Kindle with my one hand and click the next page button without having to move around.  On the iPad, I have to hold with one hand and change pages with the other.<p>4) e-ink.  I prefer reading on it.  Even in the dark I'd rather use a booklight and e-ink thank the iPad screen.<p>5) Portability: my kindle is <i>always</i> in my laptop bag.  The Amazon case for it makes it almost a no brainer to toss in and go.  I'm much less likely to drag my iPad somewhere.  I'm afraid to break it. :)<p>6) ""Free"" 3g is ridiculously useful to when I want to get new books.<p>When it comes down to it, I really just want the best reading experience I can possibly get.  The Kindle is designed specifically for that and they've done a pretty good job with it.  I've read a ridiculous amount of books since I first got one and slowed down when I switched to reading on the iPad full time.  It's just ungainly.",1280372436

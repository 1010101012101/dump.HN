58459,comment,58393,58393,0,0,socmoth,,,"hey guys this is paul from socialmoth.  <p>we had about 20k more users come in and use socialmoth than we expected the other day.  that is MORE, not total. up until that point, the dot-com and the fb app were working on the same server and using the same database.<p>my focus has been entirely following the users, and the users are on facebook.  also i should follow the money, and that is also facebook.  i moved the fb app to a new set of servers sunday, but i haven't moved the dot com to the same servers yet.<p>i plan an relinking them soon, but i've been scaling again since then.  and learning about proxy balancers (nginx vs mod proxy balancer vs haproxy - if anyone wants to give advice)<p>rkabir, if you ask a specific question about flow, i can tell you want i know and can make public.  the sites popularity was due to the facebook users.  nothing i made scaled well enough for the new popularity and i haven't gone back and redone all of the  dot com code to match the facebook scaled/optimized code.<p>omouse, do you use socialmoth?  new features are on the way.  they are done, but not publicly shown yet.  also, my facebook users are dying for new features and suggesting them, but they realize there is a lot of scaling work to do. (i love how nice my users are)  sometimes you just need to take a break and make new stuff though.",1190519606

58457,comment,57298,57298,0,0,surya,,,"I believe doing your best work, is the best way of helping the world. If you love what you are doing, if you are one with yourself when you are doing it, you are giving the most you can ever give to the world.<p>All religions say that selflessness is the path to happiness and enlightenment. I think true selflessness can only be achieved when you are truly at one with your work and its flow, when you see it all around you, and you loose yourself in it...<p>Even though Michaelangelo didn't cure any life threatening diseases he did make something that gives everyone who watches it, a moment of beauty, a moment of perfection, a moment of heaven. I think that gift is no less than any other.<p>I hope I gave you something to think about. This was my good deed of the day... :) <p>I also recommend an old Japanese movie by Akira Kurosawa called 'Ikiru'. It has a nice perspective on the topic.",1190519230

58454,comment,58404,58404,0,0,bootload,,,"I got so peeved at the crap platforms (well there not all crap but they certainly have lots of restrictions) that I wrote my own. My own efforts are just as crap but it's my crap. I can fashion my tools to work the way I want it instead of how someone else decided. For example I need something that I could (can)<p>- write/edit  with a worst a text editor or best an web ui<p>- ability to markup in a meta format<p>- access to the source in a language(s) I use<p>- good db access tools<p>- ability to evolve and add new layers or technologies<p>I also have some quirky requirements. I want static pages primarily (at least at the moment). I care more for load speeds and readability than the ability to interact RT. (currently process interaction on delayed batch close to RT).  For all the disadvantages this has a few advantages namely speed and fewer moving parts exposed.<p>My first effort was a Perl script transforming POD (Plain Old Text) files into markup. The next effort is a Python app using Django to store RestructuredText (python based plain text markup) markup in a MySQL db spitting out valid xhtml static pages. And I've already got a third system in mind using various editors with a light weight middleware web server using a db for backup but exporting to atom (something like <a href=""http://bitworking.org/projects/1812/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitworking.org/projects/1812/</a> ) and serving a combo of static pages and dynamic using some browser/Javascript approach. <p>Probably the most important thing is how it handles the data. To tell you the truth I don't really care too much about the tools because I throw or discard them like skins every couple of tech iterations. It's the data that's important. I care more about: <p>- ways to export the data safely for future use<p>- ability to add historical entries as I find them out there on the web or locked up in some roach motel of a web app<p>- re-publishing fragments of data somewhere else to some (or thinking of publishing to some as yet to exist site) other place<p>- making additions, corrections and upgrading the content over time<p>I'm finding the current batch of blogging tools worry less about these types of ideas (<i>""with the exception of say Dave Winer & scripting.com who lets face it have more history than most blogs & toolsets than most""</i>) than they should. After you get a stack of entries, say 10 years worth the tools need more sophisticated approaches to handle and evolve how you<p>- generate <p>- edit, manipulate<p>- store <p>- distribute<p>the <i>""foobar""</i> things you create. <p>I also get peeved at the way most blogging tools (and most content generation tools) seem to think of blogs as pages and not data that can be transformed into <i>""foo""</i> format and edited, stored in some meta format capable of being transformed.  <p>So in short I love defining my own toolset. I hate the fact it takes lots of thinking, time, effort and sweat.  I hate the fact the tools are constantly evolving and are less polished than I know they could be. <p>I care more about my data than the tools I create and use.",1190517251

58452,comment,58415,58446,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"No offense to these guys, but how could they simply give up? Even taking another job just to make ends meet is better than stopping. Do they know what kind of opportunity they are giving up on? If they wanted to ditch Shoutfit and try something else I'm sure YC would still help them meet investors, etc. It just amazes me they would pass up on utilizing the opportunity they still have, especially when there are so many other hackers out there (many on this forum) who would give a leg for the same opportunity...<p>Edit: I'm just going off of altay's comment in the above thread, so I probably shouldn't jump to conclusions. These guys could be working on something new for all I know",1190516999

163538,comment,163193,163257,0,0,KirinDave,,,"My misogynistic and politically incorrect, but very accurate, metaphor for erlang is, ""The Ugly Girl Who's Great In Bed."" You don't mind doing the horizontal polka with her, but she certainly won't win any beauty contests.<p>That said, a few small changes to the erlang grammar could go a long way towards fixing it (changing separators to terminators, etc). Once you get more familiar with Erlang, you go from writing ugly cascading ifs on multiple conditions to simple clean case statements on tuples. You learn when to use function-clause matching vs. internal matching, etc.",1208209893

I'm sick of how many supposedly ""reliable"" people don't live up to their promises.. yet we're supposedly meant to accept this nowadays. Well, I won't, and I'm with 37signals on this one. Ditch urgency, live up to promises, and it'll all go a lot smoother and with less stress.""<p>Fulfilling promises is about as much about which ones you make than what you do to make them happen once they're made.",1208209349

163533,comment,163177,163268,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Quite right. I've been teaching calculus for several years, and for the most part it is a soul-sucking experience. Big chunks of it are utterly pointless. The main goal of the class is attrition.<p>Seriously, integrating 1/(1+x^2)? Surfaces of revolution? Trig/hyperbolic trig substitution? Calc is full of stupid tricks that buy you closed form solutions.<p>Adding Big-O notation to calc might help a little, especially when you get to series (with Big-O notation, you can explain divergent series). It's certainly a useful topic, and I can think of a dozen topics from calc I'd love to replace with it.<p>Eliminating calculus and designing a basic math class <i>from scratch</i> would probably help a lot more.",1208208857

I know this isn't a typical post but I felt that it might be able to help some others out.<p>Doing a google search for that gives you too many garbage results so I'd prefer to hear the opinions of people I respect.<p>Given the number of responses I don't think it was too terrible of a post.",1208208479

With a month to go I can usually persuade a customer to slip a week because something just needs needs more time. I can also reconsider my time estimates for future jobs to make sure that in future the engineers get the time they need.<p>What I can't do is keep promising delivery ""tomorrow"" to external people, because I just found out today that you won't be done on time.

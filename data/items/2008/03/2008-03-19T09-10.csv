Also mac hardware is well defined. I know I'm going to be able to dual boot the centos distro we use for development, and once I've got all of the drivers figured out, I can easily get the same mac again and get that config to everyone in our company. I've bought one too many dells with <i>the same model number</i> and <i>different</i> sound, graphics, wireless hardware. My mac also sleeps when I close the lid and wakes up faster than any other computer I've ever had. This makes me happy.<p>Note: This is just <i>my</i> reason. For every other mac user you'll find a reason of their own. Some little itch that a mac just happens to scratch a little better. And yes, I find mac fanbois with bs reasons for mac superiority just as tedious as most hackers do.",1205919380
140694,comment,140363,140570,0,0,Frocer,,,"Agreed, this is probably one of my favorite sci-fi novel of all time.<p>Excellent story, well-developed characters.  I think what makes this novel so popular is because all of us can related to the main character, Ender, on some level.  Highly recommended if you haven't read it.  It's too bad the sequels aren't nearly as good.",1205918843

140692,comment,140602,140602,0,0,Tichy,,,"It takes really long to make 2 millions as a regular employee, though. Even freelancing, making much more than my employed friends, it would probably take me >= 15 years to make one million EUR (bloody taxes get in the way). And that estimate is without a family. One million really is not a lot of money, if I consider having to live off savings for maybe 30 years or more, in a future  time by which money will probably have been devaluated a lot, too (though now I can't imagine life without work, maybe eventually due to aging one has no other choice?).<p>OK, so maybe betting on a startup to succeed is a dumb plan, some hedging might be in order (occasional consulting gigs to ensure a minimum income - any other ideas?).<p>Btw., I wonder what is the average savings rate for employees? I am 35 now, and I recently realised that I am probably way behind on my savings compared to my peers... I think maybe to save about 10000€ per year is realistic?<p>Still, in my first year of work after getting my degree, according to some statistics I was already in the top 10% of earners of my country. Nevertheless I felt that without inheriting some money from parents (which I won't), I would never have been able to even afford to buy a flat. That is kind of sick, I think. Maybe life as an employee is not so easy, after all. A friend of mine is also an I worker in the top 10% range, and he said he couldn't support his family without help from his parents.",1205918660
140691,comment,140363,140363,0,0,demallien,,,"Hyperion by Dan Simmons.  It starts off with separate storylines touching on all the great sci-fi clichés - time travel, FTL travel, computer nets, out-of-control AIs, lost civilisations, humanity scindered into two estranged parts, mysterious monsters, strange maladies, it has everything.  Except, at first, this pastiche just feels disjointed.  But then, near the end, all of this wierd stuff, that you never really understand, gets pulled together into one, cohesive whole.<p>Hyperion is basically just a brilliant story, very enjoyable to read.<p>That said, if I was to criticise Hyperion, it would be that it doesn't fulfill very well one of the important functions of science fiction - the examination of the impact of technology on society.<p>Which leads to my second recommendation - The Left Hand of Darkness, by Ursula Le Guin.  Le Guin in general is excellent for examining in depth the effects that small changes in technology may have on human society - it follows naturally I guess from the fact that her father was an anthropologist...",1205918250

140688,comment,140655,140655,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"This is a mistake.<p>Firstly, if Flash on the iPhone is buggy, because Apple withheld its help, users will blame Flash and word will go around to keep it off of your iPhone.  Secondly, if Flash on the iPhone is less capable than the desktop version, and more capable than Flash Lite, developers will become irritated.  Finally, if people are making full 3D shooters and racers with the regular iPhone SDK, AND making money off of it through the iPhone store, Flash developers will be in a position of staggering disadvantage.  This is because even if Jobs lets Adobe make and distribute a Flash runtime, which is far from certain, he will certainly not let Flash developers put their apps on the app store.  Even if he did, who would by a Flash app?  In user's minds, Flash apps should be free, remember.  And once users make up their minds . . . well . . . talk to the record industry.<p>If you think advertising will underpin it all, you should be paying closer attention.<p>Flash has very little to gain, and a great deal to lose in user perception, as well as developer perception.  If Adobe chooses to go down this road, they MUST execute flawlessly.",1205917797

140686,comment,140651,140651,0,0,Frocer,,,"I have never interned in a startup environment, but I can provide some insight into what it's like to work for a corporation.  I participated in my school's coop program, which allow me to work at IBM for ~9 months in programming/design. Working in a corporation is everything you expect: very slow, process-oriented, very little responsibility.  Doesn't matter how hard you drive your manager for work, it's unlikely you will get anything substantial unless you take the initiative yourself.  I can't say I learned a lot in terms of hard technical skills (you will learn much more in school), but I have learned some very valuable soft skills -- how to coordinate work with others (it's surprisingly difficult when you are only coding a small piece of work that belongs to something much larger), how to present in front of senior managers, etc.  One of the most valuable lesson I learned is to comment your code, I remember back in school, my professors tried to drive that concept into our heads, but I always thought, why do I need to comment when I know the code by heart?  Nothing makes you realize the importance of comment until when you try to debug someone else's code, and the genius name variables after his children (serious, no joke).<p>There are valuable lessons to be learned in a huge corporation.  They are procedures, how to coordinate work, how bureaucracy works, and the most important lesson I learned is -- I dislike it and I will never want to program in a big corporation environment.<p>From what I have heard and read, you will learn much more in a start up environment.  You may not just do programming or design, but you have the opportunity to get involved with marketing, advertising, etc. But at the same time, you won't see the picture of what makes corporations successful at what they do.  If I have to do it all over again, I would probably intern at a start up because there are more learning opportunities.  Corporations are very silo-ed, every department operates on its own and it's very hard for interns to touch any other pieces of work.  (e.g. if you are a programming intern, chances are you won't have a chance to do marketing as well).<p>Hope that helps.",1205917705

140684,comment,140651,140651,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"Last summer I did an internship at, ummm, Steve Jobs's current venture. It wasn't a good fit for me, but that had nothing to do with the size of the company. The position simply wasn't a good match for my skills and experience. I was offered a full-time job as a result of the internship, but since it wasn't a good match, I turned it down.<p>That said, my feelings about the internship had little to do with the size of the company. The perks of a big-company internship were great, and you can meet a lot of other interesting hackers through a larger internship program. Also, all my previous jobs were at much smaller companies, so it was great to experience life at a large tech company first-hand. Life at the large company wasn't really any different than life at smaller companies.<p>I would suggest picking the job that interests you the most, based on the team or the project you'd be working on, and the quality of the individuals you'd be working with. The most important aspect of an internship should be the work you do. That will be the most important factor in how much you like it, and that's what you can show off in future job interviews. Plus, internships often lead to full-time jobs, and you won't want to make that decision solely based on the reputation or size of the company.",1205917686

My partner has a MacBook, so when I bought her a Garmin nuvi GPS for Christmas, I was expecting to have to fire up Fusion on my own MacBook fairly often to update it, load maps etc.  Imagine my surprise when Garmin released Mac support for their products just before Christmas.<p>If you go to the peripherals section of any electronics store these days, it is rare to find a device that doesn't support Mac.  We're also starting to see an improved support for Mac by games software producers...",1205917652
140681,comment,140651,140651,0,0,nex3,,,"I'm a junior at the University of Washington, and I was faced with similar decisions last summer and this summer. Last summer, I went with the Big Powerhouse, and I was pretty disappointed. It wasn't challenging, I wasn't working on interesting stuff, and I wasn't really learning anything. This summer, I'm going with the Internet Startup, and all indications seem to be that it will be a much better time.<p>Then again, my Big Powerhouse was Microsoft, so that may have had something to do with it. Even so, you can look at it in terms of the affect you'll have on the company as a whole. If you're in the Big Powerhouse, you're doing 1/1000th of the work. If you're in the Internet Startup, you're doing 1/30th. This means you'll be working on more important (and thus probably more interesting) stuff.",1205917607

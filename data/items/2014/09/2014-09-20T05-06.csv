8343792,comment,8340584,8341591,3,0,dredmorbius,,,"&quot;Existential risk to humans&quot; tends to be at the outer range of my own fairly pessimistic set of scenarios, but several global warming situations could run that far out.<p>Yonatan Zunger posted an especially pessimisstic bit about global warming in April of 2013.  In particular he noted:<p>_The last big spike like this was the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, about 55 million years ago. Average temperatures rose by 6C over a period of 20,000 years -- which is enough to look like a giant, sharp spike on the history-of-the-entire-planet graph...._<p>_When the biota of a planet get rewritten, the creatures that require the most delicate maintenance die first. This tends to mean really big creatures, that rely on large supplies of their foods; apex predators, which rely on the entire food chain beneath them; and &quot;canary&quot; species like many frogs, which are very sensitive and tend to be the first to die when something is going wrong. Historically, the cutoff for &quot;large creatures&quot; (that tend to not survive extinction events) seems to be in the ballpark of 20 pounds; things bigger than that just require the ecosystem to be too healthy._<p>IPCC&#x27;s estimates call for a global rise in temperatures of anywhere from 2-6°C, (3.6 - 10.8 °F).  First thing to realize is that this is an <i>average</i> rise.  Which means that in some areas (mostly over oceans, with higher albedo and greater thermal mass) it will be lower, and in others (mostly inland regions) it&#x27;s likely to be much higher.  Overland temperatures much over 49°C (about 120°F) are problematic as they tend to rule out much plant life.  Above about 65°C (about 150°F), many forms of animal life cannot keep themselves cool, even in the shade.  The result would be potentially large areas of land in which life would literally cook to death.<p>Even if we don&#x27;t go that far, there are a number of other challenges humans face, all of which tie back to population, resource consumption, and overflowing pollution sinks.<p>If you think of systems layered on top of one another, you&#x27;ve got the global financial system, global, regional, national, and local economies, governmental systems, social systems, infrastructure, and more, layered on top of ecological, biological, meteorological, oceanographic, and other systems.  Disruptions of lower systems will propogate through higher ones.<p>Disrupt enough human systems and things start to fall apart.  The claim by numerous authorities in the Collapse space is that the collapse of Western Civilization isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s <i>going</i> to happen, it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s <i>happening</i>, and likely will be for some time.  There are definitely global trends which have been pointing downward for some time, many since the 1970s, some from before that.<p>Both the Arab Spring and the Ebola outbreak are examples people point to.  Paul Mason&#x27;s <i>Why It&#x27;s Kicking Off Everywhere</i> gives a capsule summary of the dynamic of the wave of global revolutions which started in 2009.  The original essay coves the basics:\n<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/legacy/newsnight/paulmason/2011/02/twenty_reasons_why_its_kicking.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/legacy/newsnight/paulmason/2011/0...</a><p>The Ebola outbreak is being exacerbated by numerous factors -- perversely, both lack of technology and its presence are playing a role.  Many people, living close to their limits, with few resources, in crowded conditions, but with access to transportation (both ground and air) have created conditions for the disease and facilitated its spread.  Lack of literacy, ineffective communications, and other factors are also at play.  Airplanes could transfer the disease around the planet in under a day.  Nightmare scenarios have it breaking out, not in New York or London, but in Kolkata, Manilla, Cairo, or Sao Paulo.<p>The CDC predicts as many as 500,000 cases (of a disease with 70-90% mortality), I&#x27;ve seen projections far above that, though from less credible sources.  Much of this depends on how rapidly exponential growth takes off, and when, if ever, inhibitory effects start slowing the spread.<p>Where things get interesting though, for ... interesting values of interesting, is when you consider the systemic effects of disruption.<p>In her letter to President Obama, Liberia&#x27;s President Sirleaf gives one small example of this:<p><i>With blanket travel bans, border closures and interactions on vessels berthing at our ports, this has become more than a humanitarian emergency. In a country that has barely emerged from a 30-year period of civil and political unrest, with the presence of a large youthful(mainly unemployed)population, some of whom were child soldiers-this health emergency threatens civil order. What is even more heartbreaking is that we are unable to reopen our basic and secondary health facilities because terrified health workers, who have watched colleagues die, are afraid to return to work.</i><p>That is:  disease has disrupted transport, which means commerce, which means civil unrest.<p>At a global scale, breakdowns in one portion of a globalized system (finance, trade, energy, raw materials, gas, water, food) could lead to a domino effect in others.  David Korowicz&#x27;s &quot;Financial System Supply-Chain Cross-Contagion: a study in global systemic collapse&quot; takes a look at this:  <a href=""http://www.feasta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Trade-Off1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.feasta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Trade-Off1....</a><p>While it might not reduce the total population to 5 million or fewer, it could well disrupt systems to a level that modern industrialized economies simply could not function.  Which might be a pretty big deal in some areas.",1411192083

8343762,comment,8342959,8343711,8,0,ghshephard,,,"Long, Long before there was any shortage of drinking water, the various water authorities would simply increase the prices of water to levels which reduce residential usage.<p>The problem in California isn&#x27;t lack of water for individual use (for the most part, there are a few small communities that are having to truck in water), it&#x27;s the impact on Agriculture, which is hugely important to the economy of California, and our general food security.<p>If you were wondering why there aren&#x27;t more water restrictions for individuals, (Like leaning on people hard to take shorter shower, or use low-flush toilets, or ultra-low-flush toilets) - here&#x27;s why: Changes to individual use will only have a small impact on our water use - 80% is used for agriculture.  Individual restricting use by 20% will only have a 4% impact on overall water use.<p>With that said, there is a lot of room for California to transition to a &quot;Desert Water Existance&quot;<p>In 2011, the average californian used about 326 gallons/day of water.  With water restriction, that can, with a little bit of expense, and changes in landscaping (no green lawns), be brought down to 150 gallons/day, and with a bit more expense (typically around the toilet), be brought down to 100 gallons/day with some lifestyle changes (typically shorter showers).<p>On the flip side, California almonds use 1.1 trillion gallons of water each year.  That one crop uses enough water to support a population of about 30 million people @ 100 gallons a day.<p>For individual water use, though - a lot of the California population is right beside the ocean.  Desalination costs about $0.75/cubic meter (264 gallons) based on recent Singapore Desalination plant deployments.  If we didn&#x27;t want a lifestyle change, then 329 gallons / day * 30 days  / 264 gallons * 0.75 = about $28 to generate the water needed to maintain our lavish California lifestyle (add some more for distribution, which is reasonable for coastal cities without distance or elevation for pumping.<p>This only works for individuals though - Agriculture needs cheap water to be sustainable, and much of the farmland is too far away from the coast (or too high), too make for economical distribution.",1411191064

It&#x27;s a big fucking pain in the ass, and it is totally irrelevant to the success or failure of a business.<p>Maybe you can&#x27;t see the view from your father&#x27;s side of the equation.

He&#x27;s probably thrilled just to see you get down and grind hard.  Do you know how rare that is in a 16-year old?  That is gold to a dad.<p>He was probably crushed when you gave him the MacBook back.  Because that meant you were quitting.  I hate it when I see my kids quit.  He doesn&#x27;t care about getting his investment back.  His investment is you.  He loves you.<p>You had a company that you 100% owned.  You quit.  Your reason for quitting is because your father did not give you something you do not need.  That&#x27;s stupid on stilts.<p>Don&#x27;t do that.

I still think the article isn&#x27;t sufficient, at all, for even an elementary introduction to anything. It&#x27;s incredibly incomplete. An introductory cs course is going to present asymptotic complexity analysis (written using Landau notation) as one of the TOOLS for thinking about the efficiency of code. It will hopefully not just hop to big O without setting up the context. The author can fix this by just reworking the preface. It needs to answer the question: &quot;why are we doing this and how will this accomplish anything?&quot;<p>If you fail to frame the context and the semantics well enough, you&#x27;ll end up with people running around saying that an algorithm is &quot;big O of blah.&quot; AGH<p>The introduction to the concept is articulated by the following comparison:<p>&#x27;We want to measure code efficiency. Big O notation describes this. Here are some examples.&#x27;<p>vs.<p>&#x27;We want to measure code efficiency. We can do this by thinking about its usage of resources (complexity). for example, total run time and memory usage. One of the ways to compare the efficiencies of algorithms is to compare their asymptotic behaviors. We can express this using big O notation. Here are some examples.&#x27;<p>-----<p>The author talks about how big O notation is awesome because you can drop the constants. It is not explained why this is awesome or useful. Interestingly, it later says that sometimes it isn&#x27;t good because the constants sometimes matter. What is the reader supposed to understand here?<p>There&#x27;s no followup as to what to think about after you determine the &quot;big O&quot; of an algorithm. Either he forgot to write this or figured that it was obvious at that point. Considering that he didn&#x27;t sufficiently explain the concept&#x27;s motivation either, I don&#x27;t see how an uneducated reader will get a clear picture.",1411190066

8343726,comment,8342718,8342718,0,0,tel,,,"First, to be clear, I really liked this presentation. The criticism below is both technical and small---all in all I greatly enjoy Rich Hickey&#x27;s work and generally admire his ability to talk compellingly about complex technical topics.<p>That said.<p>I somewhat disliked Hickey&#x27;s presentation of typing transducers here. I feel as though he builds a number of strawmen toward typing and then tries to knock them down and suggest that either Clojure has some kind of mystical mechanism that is ineffable to types or that the exercise of typing transducers is wasteful. I disagree on both accounts, I suppose. I think types are useful for analysis and teaching.<p>The two major points he seems to make is that in order to &quot;properly type&quot; transducers you must<p><pre><code>    1. Index the type of the &quot;accumulation so far&quot; so 
       that it cannot be transformed out-of-order
    2. Implement early stopping &quot;without wrapping anything
       except for the reduced value&quot;
</code></pre>
There may be other critiques as well, but I want to examine these two in the context of Haskell.<p>With respect to the first point, the major concern appears to be prohibiting behavior loosely described as &quot;applying the reducing function, say, 3 times and then returning the first resulting accumulation&quot;. In some sense, the idea is to force us to be faithful in passing on the accumulating parameter. In code, a pathological setting is the following:<p><pre><code>    transduce :: (r -> a -> r) -> (r -> a -> r)
    transduce reduce accu0 a = 
      let acc1 = reduce acc0 a
          acc2 = reduce acc1 a
          acc3 = reduce acc2 a
      in  acc1
</code></pre>
The concern is unfounded in a pure language, however, since calling `reduce` can have no side effects. This entails that all possible effects on the world of calling `reduce` are encapsulated in the return and, therefore, we can completely eliminate the steps producing `acc2` and `acc3` without worry.<p><pre><code>    transduce :: (r -> a -> r) -> (r -> a -> r)
    transduce reduce accu0 a = 
      let acc1 = reduce acc0 a
      in  acc1
</code></pre>
Now, there may be concern here that we still want to index the `r` type somehow to allow for changes of accumulation to occur. This is not the case (in <i>this</i> simple model!) as in order to achieve the &quot;baggage carrier independence&quot; property the `r` type must be left unspecified until the transducer is actually applied. The cleanest way to do that is to use a higher-rank type (Hickey mentions these briefly and offhandedly toward the end of his talk)<p><pre><code>    type Transducer a b = forall r . (r -> b -> r) -> (r -> a -> r)
</code></pre>
which thus prohibits the implementer of a Transducer from affecting the values of `r` in any way whatsoever---they must be left anonymous until someone decides to <i>use</i> the Tranducer on a particular collection of values `a`.<p>(It must be noted that the model given above is isomorphic to a &quot;Kleisli arrow on the list monad&quot; which I described a little bit here <a href=""http://jspha.com/posts/typing-transducers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jspha.com/posts/typing-transducers/</a>. It should also be noted that this model includes neither (a) the ability to use local state to capture time-varying transductions or (b) the ability to terminate early)<p>With respect to the second point, I&#x27;d like to suggest that there is a difference between the semantic weight of wrapping the result types in an Either in order to indicate early termination and the implementation weight. I completely agree that using an Either to implement early stopping (as it&#x27;s easy, if finicky for the library implementor, to do) will involve wrapping and unwrapping the &quot;state&quot; of the transduction continuously. I also would like to suggest that it&#x27;s a very natural way of representing the &quot;accumulation | reduction&quot; notion Hickey uses in his own &quot;Omnigraffle 8000 type system&quot;.<p>We really would like to capture the idea of the transducer state as being &quot;either&quot; in-progress or fully-reduced and act accordingly. If Clojure&#x27;s implementation of that requires fewer runtime tags than an Either, so be it, but I personally fail to see a semantic difference except in the way one can play fast-and-loose with dynamic types over static types to begin with.<p>---<p>So, I gave above an implementation of Transducers in types which has some of their properties, but certainly not all. In fact, I abused the fact that there is no ambient state in Haskell in order to ensure that a certain property would hold (notably this doesn&#x27;t require a type system at all, just purity). I also argued that using Either is a perfectly natural way to implement early termination in such a transduction pipeline.<p>I&#x27;ve also made an extension to the `(r->b->r) -> (r->a->r)` mechanism which enables local state to be enabled for various components of the transduction pipeline. A version without early termination is available here:<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/tel/714a5ea2e015d918f135"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/tel/714a5ea2e015d918f135</a><p>Notably, this uses most of the same typing tricks as `(r->b->r) -> (r->a->r)` but adds a &quot;reduction local hidden state&quot; variable which lets us implement `take` and `partition`. This takes Hickey&#x27;s notion of needing to be explicit about the state being used to a whole new level.<p>---<p>So what is the point of all this?<p>I&#x27;d like to argue that Transducers do not present such a mysterious mechanism that they cannot be sanely typed in a reasonably rich language. I believe that I can capture most of their salient features in types without using the dependent indexing Hickey suggested was necessary.<p>More than this, the compartmentalized, hidden reducer-local state in the Gist implementation allows for each reduction step to include fairly exotic local states in their state machine. You could implement a kind of type indexing here if desired and no end-user would ever know of its existence.<p>I also absolutely concede that many type systems people regularly use could not achieve this kind of encoding.<p>Finally, what I really want to say is that type systems are not something to be denigrated. I believe some of the earliest &quot;transducers v. types&quot; argumentation took a nasty turn as amateur type theorists (myself included) rushed to write things like &quot;Transducers are just X&quot;.<p>I want to apologize for any kind of bad feelings my own writing in that thread may have stirred up. I try not to be haughty or dismissive with this kind of writing, but I also make mistakes.<p>So what I&#x27;d really like to suggest is that types should not be taken as reductivist on interesting techniques like Transducers but instead as a tool for analyzing their construction and either improving it or better teaching it. Hickey himself often turns to some kind of &quot;pseudotyping&quot; to talk about how Transducers work---formalizing those notions should only lead to greater clarity.<p>Of course, implementations will differ in small ways. As I&#x27;ve noted abundantly here, a major difference between the Haskell and Clojure implementations is driven more by Haskell&#x27;s purity than its typing. Hopefully, however, exploration of alternative implementations and the rich analysis produced by their typing can help to introduce new ideas.<p>For instance, the Gist implementation, if you strip the types away, is an interesting divergence in raw functionality from Clojure Transducers---if Clojure Transducers are &quot;reduction function transformers&quot; than the Gisted Transducers are &quot;Moore-style (Infinite) State Machine transformers&quot; and that difference allows the implementer to be extra explicit about the use of local state.<p>I&#x27;d rather see discussion about whether such InFSM transformation techniques have a place in Transducers literature than a fight over whether or not its possible or reasonable to &quot;type transducers&quot;.",1411189247

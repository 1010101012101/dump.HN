Anyone who has coded games as a single dev probably knows how bogged down you get as the game becomes more complex. Generating graphics yourself is a huge time suck which they have neatly avoided. What&#x27;s intriguing is that the game design appears to be flexible enough to spend time coding mineralogy and then jumping to say horticulture while still being manageable.

The phone-based 2FA products all allow web app developers to control their own login UX while mitigating the password vulnerability.<p>The incipient success of 2FA solutions is also a reason I wouldn&#x27;t bet on browser-based public key authentication or federation happening; the latter solutions are competing with a more pragmatic, simpler alternative.",1372859888

If I post my room for rent, I would be happy to have more people see the listing, especially with a clean UI (like padmapper).  I&#x27;d be aggrieved if Craig Newmark blocked people from seeing the listing.  The &quot;server load&quot; issue is a red herring; people have been more than willing to pay a reasonable fee to offset that, and it&#x27;s a minimal amount of load to begin with.<p>It&#x27;s even more egregious in the case of a posting tool, which is what this appears to be.<p>I agree IV is a vastly bigger deal; I personally just soft-boycott Craigslist, but if I had a chance to destroy IV while taking only moderate legal or financial damage, I&#x27;d do so.  But I think a lot of that is due to the patent system being totally horrible, and copyright being only moderately broken (and trademark being only slightly broken).

You could even further extend the concept with an insurance against any losses that might be the result of a lost law suit, thereby making the whole thing completely risk-free for the insured.<p>You&#x27;ll have to run the math on how common these law suits are vs. what the costs are to run the case, but effectively it could be amortized over a lot of people, so it might make sense.

Seems a little odd as a response. Perhaps your intent would be clearer if your replies didn&#x27;t hypothesize quite so much about what the parent might be thinking. I noticed a lot of &quot;ifs&quot; in your most recent post as well, as in &quot;if you believe this or that&quot;. Comes off rather straw-mannish.

For instance, criminal law is set up to avoid railroading suspects and it&#x27;s a pretty easily identifiable fallacy, in general.<p>In any event, your conclusion that I come close to claiming them equally likely rests on its own fallacy. That is, this statement is so general as to be misleading:<p><i>&quot;If your mental model assigns the same prior probability to assassination as to car accidents, it&#x27;s likely broken&quot;</i><p>First, I didn&#x27;t assign a probability.

It is a fiery, one car, high speed accident, under unexplained circumstances. And, he is not just a random person, but a prominent reporter who brought down a powerful person and was working on a &quot;big&quot; story involving, presumably, other powerful people. Ignoring this information, and simply relying on the percentage of the general population who are in car accidents vs assassinated (i.e. relying on the priors) is misguided to say the least.<p>And while there is a lack of concrete evidence in either direction at this point, the circumstances and information we do have point to the fact that we should be asking questions, not drawing conclusions on any side.

Most offices just use a regular conference room to get their Perfing on.<p>Really, when a Google manager threatens to &quot;take you into the Perf Room&quot;, it&#x27;s purely metaphor. Calibration applies to all employees (not just the disfavored ones) and no one is actually in that room as they are &quot;calibrated&quot;, so the phrase has no meaning other than as a general-purpose threat.<p>I&#x27;ve heard plenty of stories about bad managers at Google: people given low calibration scores to keep them captive on undesirable projects, people threatened with PIPs for failing to fall in line on RNCH, and one case of a manager who used phony performance problems to find things out about peoples&#x27; health and personal issues, then exploit the knowledge in sadistic ways.<p>The transfer process is pretty damn broken at Google. A company with that much in the way of resources has absolutely no excuse not to use open allocation. It&#x27;s actually an ethical problem. If you&#x27;re poor and fighting for survival, you may not be able to afford open allocation. If you&#x27;re a rich as Google, it&#x27;s an ethical imperative.<p>20% time <i>is</i> a huge gamble. It might be one worth making, sure, but it&#x27;s dishonest to say there&#x27;s no risk. If your manager doesn&#x27;t get a lot of calibration points and you have a 20% time project, you&#x27;ll often be thrown under the bus so more &quot;loyal&quot; reports can get a decent score. That&#x27;s just the way stack ranking works. If one person on each team is to be shot in the head, the person perceived as least loyal (flight risk/20%T) will be the first one gone.",1372857905

You <i>could</i> use a power meter to determine the resultant signal strength, but if you&#x27;ve planned/done this more than a couple of times, you know what it is going to say. You <i>could</i> use an attenuator if needed to protect the detector, but since the detector current is dependent upon the gain of its amplifier, it would be simpler to simply adjust the gain. In fact using an auto-gain-circuit (AGC) here would be preferred, since it will automatically compensate for any differences in splice quality (within range). Also, it would be clumsy to design an amp that could easily burn out your detector, but sometimes you do crazy things when pushing performance to the limits.<p>IMO you couldn&#x27;t use a silicon detector like the one from Perkin Elmer. It is fairly large (170um x 170um), and therefore has a large Capacitance, and therefore is as you say, slow. However, such detectors exist. They would probably use InGaAs if they used off the shelf stuff. Here is an example <a href=""http://www.thorlabs.com/Thorcat/10700/APD310-Manual.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thorlabs.com/Thorcat/10700/APD310-Manual.pdf</a> There are almost certainly better choices than InGaAs if they forget about cost and don&#x27;t need to produce enough to supply the whole world. Given that NSA has its own chip-fab capabilities (it does), this seems like a possibility. Being on the ocean floor here is great because it is cool and dark, and therefore low-thermal-noise (also not a lot of RF, I bet).<p>>>This is not possible to do on a live system without it being service affecting.<p>>Why not? The only impact on the fiber being tapped would be a brief period of heating and a temporary change in refractive index over, perhaps, a couple cm of fiber.<p>I also see no reason that this or some other method could not be employed on a live cable, and go unnoticed.<p>My question is how the NSA gets the data back to where they want it. They have to lay cables of their own, probably have remote stations to reject some of the data; or maybe NSA has a secret undersea fiber network that rivals the normal one. They certainly have the money, I just never considered it.",1372857409

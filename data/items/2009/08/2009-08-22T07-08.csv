Apple the company cops a fair bit of criticism from him, including on subjects such as the App Store, DRM, pricing etc, but Gruber explains in detail exactly why he is so enamoured by they products.",1250927640

779143,comment,778252,778252,0,0,billswift,,,"There was something I read in the past year about the conflict between recovery and forensics - preserving the evidence for an investigation prevents a quick and smooth recovery, and conversely quickly recovering from a problem destroys evidence.  So real world systems that have to keep working either need a complete backup system (ridiculously expensive) or they need to stay down until the investigation is completed (which could be even worse, especially if a gov't agency with a stronger sense of CYA than urgency is doing it).  Investigating airplane crashes doesn't have this problem, since the plane isn't going anywhere.  I've spent the last ten minutes googling trying to find the source and can't.",1250927247

That is, when some corporate politics demand the product must be in PHP but you feel you start losing your mind writing in it... well, write in your favorite language and compile it to PHP!",1250927125

779136,comment,779108,779108,0,0,billswift,,,"Part of the problem seems to be the programmer's habit of using the shortest possible variable names and commands: ls, cp, mv, and how many programs have variables a, b, x, and so on.  There shouldn't be any drawback to using longer descriptive names (or funny, arbitrary names) for languages since you won't have to type them often; and they are much superior in searchability.  The more unique the better for searchability, in fact.
Also, can anyone tell me what he's talking about in making C ""easy to search on the internet.""  Finding general information on C has been extremely frustrating.",1250925869

779132,comment,779108,779108,0,0,michaelfairley,,,"I think this goes for a lot more than just programming languages. FOSS projects in general tend to pick some generic English words as names that make them really hard to find. I've even seen a few startups that've fallen into this pit.<p>Ironically, the fact that most ""decent"" domain names have been taken is forcing startups to put more time into coming up with a name which could ultimately help their searchability, though it does come at the expense of the ""speakability"" of their name.",1250925632

There's also a difference between an app being sold in store for months and an app being pulled from the store!  Reminder, it was Apple pulling 3 existing Google voice applications that prompted questions to Google about the status of their official app in the first place.<p>Google's response at the time sounded pretty final: ""We will continue to work to bring our services to iPhone users, for example, by taking advantage of advances in mobile browsers.""",1250925256

Six or eight weeks seems like plenty of time to decide.<p>However, there <i>is</i> a big difference between an app being still under review and being rejected.<p>Arrington's language claiming that Apple's answer to the FCC was ""a total lie"" reminds me of Dick Cheney talking about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. There's ""overwhelming evidence""? And that's enough for you to accuse Apple of lying to the FCC on TechCrunch? Obviously not all journalists hold themselves to the same standards.",1250924605
779119,comment,779046,779046,0,0,zhyder,,,"There's probably been a change in mindset at Apple over the last 2 years, from seeing Google more as a partner to seeing it more as a competitor. Unless something from Google (like Search/Maps/Youtube) is obviously of big value to most iPhone users, Apple would probably want to keep Google on the outer side of the wall.",1250924576
779118,comment,778805,778805,0,0,evgen,,,"Yeah, we all knew autoconf was not too great back in 2003 when this was written.  It hasn't gotten much better or much worse.  I think the only thing that has really changed is that there has been a gradual convergence on a smaller number of ""platforms"" (hardware, OS, and language VMs) so that it is no longer worth the effort of maintaining yet another obscure toolchain to deal with the corner cases.  If the standard makefile (or rakefile/setup.py/Makefile.PL) works for Ubuntu, Redhat/Centos, and OS X most developers would consider the job done and move on; they now seem far more willing to tell the people running obscure hardware/os combos that they are SOL unless they can hack the makefiles themselves.",1250924552
779117,comment,778676,778902,0,0,wvenable,,,"I don't think Apple is developing a competitor to Google Voice -- which is probably part of the problem.  If they did build a competitor, it really wouldn't matter.  Apple could do it better and more seamlessly.<p>However, what's really happening is that Apple is seeing the writing on the wall.  A lot of the core functionality of the phone, like Maps and search, are already provided by Google.  Once you add in Google Voice with call management, voicemail, and SMS then suddenly it's not really Apple's phone anymore -- it's Google's.",1250924529

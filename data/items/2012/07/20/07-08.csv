The managers themselves get stack ranked in their managers staff all the way up to the CEO. There fore managers themselves get ranked and cut. But that is not what we see most companies. In many of those companies the axe falls only on people working on grass root levels.

Non Parental care giving involved both relatives (kinship care) and non relatives (Day care). The NICHD study was based on the ecological theory of Uri Bronfenbrenner (1979) [29]. Analysis of the effects of family and child care revealed that the characteristics of the family and the nature and quality of the mothers relationship with the child was a significantly better predictor of childrens outcome.""\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_displacement#Effects_on_attachment_development"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_displacement#Effects_on_a...</a><p>Also: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory#Maternal_deprivation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory#Maternal_depr...</a><p>Merely quoting the easiest sources, there are lots of studies to be found online.<p>><i>I believe there are a certain percentage of women who either don't willingly breast-feed or are incapable.

4269874,comment,4266983,4266983,2,0,tmbsundar,,,"I am not sure why M$ is singled out for this ""Stack Ranking"" practice. While in reality every big company has implemented some or other variation of this system.<p>G# and particularly Jack Welch was the one who first introduced this system en masse. Even he, IIRC, did say that, this Forced Ranking (as it was called), system should be more of a short term thing where in you clean the system of the non-performers (how can someone identify justly and accurately is a question) and do not enforce this once it has run its course (3-5 years). Everyone attributed the success of the G#'s northward share prices during his reign to this ""performance culture"". If there was any truth in that approach, only it has not sustained after Immelt took over.<p>Even I>M follows this so called ""bell curve"" based assessment. Every manager should strictly adhere to the skew in his department, down to the smallest of teams.<p>With this being essentially a HR question for decades to solve, with so many people graduating with MBA HRs and Ph.Ds, I am surprised at the lack of progress or do not know of any alternative system being implemented in a big company successfully.<p>The normalization which is done at these companies make a mockery of sound statistical principles. A bell curve is forced on even the smallest of teams rather than letting a pattern emerge with very large populations where the distribution is in a shape of a bell curve.<p>e.g., In a particularly bad year, in a sales team of 10 people the guy/ girl who sold a 50 mill USD as opposed to a top ranker who has done a 150 million is rated bad and equated with some body who wrote 1000 lines of code and his project got cancelled (Note: Project could have got cancelled for any reason, not necessarily and least likely because of the code he wrote). A person who wrote 1000 loc and showed off (read:built visibility with managers who decide his fate on the rating discussions) could easily get a better rating. The whole system goes around a) building perception b) taking  credit for success c) pushing responsibility for failure onto someone else. People become paranoid. Nobody shares information with any one else which would help the other guy get a better rating. The organization suffers as a result.<p>Despite all this and despite Edward Deming's call decades ago to abolish this rating system as one of his 14 principles, I have not seen a successfully implemented system which replaces this Darwinistic one. Does anybody have any examples of better systems or better implementations in organizations?",1342770754

I want to back him up in some ways, but to also narrow the scope of his statement to not include all computers:<p>The presence of a separate, non-computational storage in computers based on the von Neumann architecture implies the representation of state (at some level or another) is possible by those same machines. Consequently, we are tempted to utilize that capacity for state as storage for intermediate data within program execution itself, rather than just as a place to store the executed program itself.<p>I could be totally missing the mark on it having to do with the von Neumann model of storing, fetching and executing programs. But from my limited reading about computers such as ENIAC, which required the circuit to be altered to route signals prior to execution, and then run through the program all at once. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, because this stuff fascinates me and I'd love to be told straight.<p>TL;DR: Storage implies state, so we wrote tools (languages) to leverage that.",1342770609

Imagine something you do with muscle memory every day - maybe typing fast or editor keyboard shortcuts or somesuch.  Now deprive you of sleep, and food, and make you anxious, and then have someone with a gun at your head.  Are you still going to be typing as fast?  With the same error rate?  Are you going to be making the same keyboard shortcuts?<p>Having said all that, I agree it's a valid risk.<p>But it's extreme.  Other risks are interesting to look at.<p>The game produces one stream of output mixed from one unique (to each player) log in sequence and some random data.  So recording many streams would seem to make the real sequence available, and now you just need to simulate the player response to that input.  Analysis of sound is an established technology now, having had considerable investment and research because of its military technology.  Recording the sound of keystrokes (of type writers, some printers, computer keyboards) can produce accurate transcripts of what has been written.<p>Having said all that, I am glad that there are people researching this stuff.  It's a bizarrely under-researched gap in security.<p>And the underlying idea seems reasonable enough.

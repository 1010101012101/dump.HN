If you are an end-user, yes, you can protect your individual password against stupid hashing schemes by using passwords with lots of entropy. (I use KeePassX for this.)<p>However, if you are a service provider, you have to protect your users from the stupid passwords that around 30% of them are likely to use and re-use elsewhere, and you do that by using a smart hashing scheme (like bcrypt or scrypt) that makes brute-forcing the passwords an annoying and time-consuming endeavor.",1355950798

It is impractical to precompute the hashes for (that is, have rainbow tables for) every possible salt, since rainbow tables take up a huge amount of space and take time to generate. Instead, you have to choose a specific password you want to attack and generate the table just for that password. Somebody is not just going to ""have the rainbow table"" for the salt G$F#V2.<p>Your calculations are off by several orders of magnitude. Bcrypt can be customized to take more time, but a reasonable amount of time might be 0.1 seconds per password, or 10 passwords per second. Most users are already logged in, so logging in should not be a very common operation.<p>By comparison, a $500 graphics card can hash billions of SHA1 passwords per second. So what takes 1 second to brute force with SHA1 will take 100 million times as long, or over 3 years, to brute force using bcrypt.<p>Note that a 10 character all lowercase password has 26^10 possibilities. If we are just targeting this password it will take 19 hours at 2 billion SHA1 hashes per second (well, on average half of that, so around 10 hours), and over 447000 years at 10 bcrypt hashes per second(again, half that on average).",1355949819

Taking a principled (I would at this point prefer 'stubborn' I think) stance on H.264 won't change reality. It just hurts us and our users.<p>Firefox got to the point where we are on desktop today by embracing reality. In the early days we started supporting IE-isms like document.all that were god awfully ugly and non-standard. But it was needed for compatibility so we can give people a usable web experience. The web uses H.264. Thats an unpleasant fact, but its a fact. We have to support it whether we like it or not, so we can be around for the next round and continue to influence the web for the better.""</i><p>So to say that they ""gave up"" isn't the whole story.

It doesn't gain you anything.<p>What we're talking about here is different, the common approach to dealing with salted hashes. You have a big list of commonly-used passwords -- ""abc123"", ""logmein"", etc. -- and you have a list of hashes from your stolen database, and a list of salts from the same. You feed all that in to a program that just computes the hash using your password list + the known salt.<p>If the salt varies by user, the attacker is in for a long day, but can still expect to break a lot of passwords if the database is using MD5 or SHA1.<p>If the salt varies by user, and the database is using bcrypt (or better yet, scrypt), then the attacker is in for a long couple of years. bcrypt with a decent work factor should take in the neighborhood of 1 cpu-second on non-specialized hardware to compute a hash. If you have a database of 15,000 passwords, you're looking at 4 cpu-hours <i>per hash</i>.<p>Compare that to GoofHash(): on my sorta-decent laptop, GoofHash() runs in 0.035s.

I wouldn't know)<p>Also, those programmers typically would not know how to change their code to get rid of warnings. If they do, or if their compiler shoves a solution in their face (for example, a compiler might suggest to do <i>""if((y=f(x)))""</i>) to get rid of an 'assignment inside if' warning), they do not see the advantage of the extra work.<p>The end result is code that produces hundreds of warnings. If a code change brings in a new one, people don't notice and/or don't care.<p>Some IDEs make things worse by allowing you to filter out warnings and messages from their output, so that you can focus on compiler errors. That is good for good programmers (they will fix errors, compile again, and then study every single warning), but bad for those who are happy to have code that compiles at all, as they will run into 'do not show me warnings' mode.",1355948655

In theory, if the TSA is doing its job well, it's actually <i>reducing</i> budgetary needs and slashing fat in favor of efficiency. The TSA should be trying to become <i>clever</i> and <i>nimble</i>, moreso than massive and overhead-burdened.<p>But the self-preservation mandate suggests the opposite. Self-preservation, for a government agency, means making sure you preserve or grow your budget year over year -- because you're fighting other agencies for it. Every dollar you get is up for grabs by other agencies next fiscal, and vice versa. Accordingly, becoming expensive and inefficient works in favor of self-preservation. As any seasoned bureaucrat knows, not achieving results means asking for more money to throw at the problem.

Or if they don't need any extra labor but they need anything else they can use the cash for that. Even if it's a lot less romanticized, getting full value for your labor out of a market economy then redirecting part of it to charitable causes probably does a lot more overall good than doing a (relatively) inefficient amount of labor.

I know so many designers-come-web-developers who struggle with the back-end portion of web development. Many use cases simply don't need the full flexibility of a web app framework, but do need more than what you can cobble together with outside tools like the various embeddable form tools and widgets.<p>IMO, the authentication & authorization portion of your app is going to make or break the result. I'd like to make a suggestion. There is an authorization library for Rails named CanCan. It uses a declarative definition for authorization that is similar (loosely) to what you've got going right now. There is also an extension for CanCan called Cantango, which builds out the concept of roles as packages of permissions.<p>Again, I'm speaking really loosely here, but it looks like you're still working on this portion of the product, and these libraries work in a way that I think makes sense to your target market. The declarative style is a good fit for font end developers. You simply describe how you'd like users to interact with the API, and you're done. If you incorporated some of the ideas from these two libraries, I'd be really thrilled :)<p>Can't wait to recommend this.<p><a href=""https://github.com/ryanb/cancan"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ryanb/cancan</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango</a>",1355947333

Please get in touch if you're interested.  I can supply a bit of capital in exchange for larger shareholding.<p>Also, if you're already working on or planning a startup, please reply to this thread so that the other South African readers can know that there is hope!<p>I'm a developer with 5 years of experience, mainly Microsoft, but have started doing a lot of Ruby on Rails in the last year and have played with PHP, did a year of C++ etc.  Running Ubuntu and I'm ready to repent from my Microsoft development ways.  I had a serious aversion towards PHP, so I'm glad RoR came along. I think I would work well with another developer or potentially a designer.<p>I have a degree in computer science - best in class, for what it's worth.  But I was too busy pretending not to be a geek to meet any interesting people to start a company with.  Sigh.",1202730876

113308,comment,113122,113122,0,0,murrayh,,,"Fantastic, I look forward to seeing this service take off. However, I think you have a major (and seemingly hidden) issue: trust.<p>Don't get me wrong, I don't think you guys are out to swindle me or anything (quite the opposite), but honestly your website sets my 'dodgy brothers' sensor tingling. The main source of information, the FAQ, intermingles sales pitches with fragmented bites of detail about how the service actually works. Most of the FAQ is fluff, with the few facts hidden amongst it. I have several questions about how the service works. For example: When do you take your cut? What happens to uncollected funds? If I donate 10c to someone, am I going to be sent an email demanding payment 5 times a day? (I am not asking for a response on these questions here – I think this information should be on the website itself).<p>At the moment, if I use your service, I know what is going to happen in a general sense (and I had to read thoroughly to even get this far), but I don't know all the details. Because I don't know the details, I have to trust that you are going to do these right. But why should I trust you to do that? If you were trustworthy, wouldn't you be upfront in the first place? The more I have to trust you, the less willing I am going to be to trust you.<p>Also, be-careful of how you advertise yourselves. Quite a few statements in that FAQ are quite strange, like discussing passing on future savings to the tip receivers, and the whole money transfer service thing. Why are you asking for more of my trust, or my help? Me... help a company? You're supposed to be helping me! I don't want to trade with you because you're going to be help me in the future, I want to trade with you because you are going to help me right now. So you just need to sell your current rates and features convincingly. Don't get me wrong, slash your prices as soon as you can, but don't promise you will, just do it and let everyone know you've done it when you've done it. You can't tell me you're customer orientated; almost every company says it. Let your customers tell me (word of mouth style, not via your home-page :-) ).<p>I believe this trust to be an extremely important issue for you to deal with, because you aren't some website asking for my email address, you are a website dedicated to handling money transfers.<p>“If I were king of the zoo,” I would drop the FAQ format and split the information out into two separate sections. The first would be your selling page, something that compels customers to try the service. The second would be simple, no fluff, factual explanation of what happens. Screenshots, diagrams, and examples can make all the difference.<p>Sorry, I don't mean to be so negative. You guys have the opportunity to make something great; its excites a man such as myself!",1202729111
113307,comment,113306,113306,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Indeed. We'll need to do something clever to prevent that. Hopefully we grow fast enough that it is a problem soon.<p>I'm very interested in giving more than the ""top tips"" page. I'd like to build a recommendation engine that give you want you want to see, based upon your past tipping behavior. That could entirely eliminate the other problems with other social news sites. We'll see.<p>A combination of recommendation engine, sock-puppet squelching, manual site curation, crowd sourcing, and tweaks to our hotness algorithm should be a solution.",1202728911

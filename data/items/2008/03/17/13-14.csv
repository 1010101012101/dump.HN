He intimately made every aspect of that work part of his brain's firmware.  After reading about that in Chapter 3 of Jessica Livingston's Founders at Work, I have made a conscious effort to do the same with my software.",1205761969

138889,comment,138149,138219,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"I worked at a company where we used a decimal number to represent a tree for a threaded forum.  It meant that we could use an ORDER BY clause and quickly get all the descendants sorted, like this:<p>7.401\n7.40101\n7.40102\n7.4010201\n7.40103\n7.4010301<p>The downside was that it wasn't nearly this straightforward -- numbers seemed to be assigned haphazardly.  And the scheme wasn't documented well, so it was nearly impossible for new programmers to understand.<p>I would not recommend this approach again.  If you need high-performance searches for descendants, a separate table relating ancestors to descendants will be much more straightforward in the long-run.",1205759977
138888,comment,138149,138477,0,0,jbert,,,"Agreed. An interesting alternative approach to a single 'parent' pointer in the record is the use of an ancestor table.<p><a href=""http://www.evolt.org/working_with_hierarchical_data_in_sql_using_ancestor_tables"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.evolt.org/working_with_hierarchical_data_in_sql_u...</a><p>This allows all children (or parents) to be fetched in a single query. A suitable ""order by"" clause also groups them together for easier processing in one pass.<p>The cost is the same as any denormalisation - additional updates and integrity issues - so it isn't a no-brainer but it's probably a win in most such situations.",1205759519

138886,comment,138806,138806,0,0,fiaz,,,"I like Rails a lot because it allows me to focus on concept and less on the actual code.  If anything does pan out (which might happend 5% of the time if I go through enough concepts), then it's time to revisit whether or not Rails is the appropriate framework -- IF there are issues with it.<p>I get tons of ideas; Rails <i>and</i> Ruby together (I cannot begin to tell you how valuable Watir is) afford me enough speed so that I can prove if the concept is worthwhile while at the same time have something to build upon towards a production application.  I could easily do the same in Java (what I use 40 hours/week), but I'd spend an equal amount of time on coding as I do on concept/design.<p>The fact that I don't have to worry much about coding components from scratch is useful specifically because I have a day job!  Even if I didn't have a day job, I'd be cranking out more concepts using Rails than I would with Java.<p>So what if Rails lowers the barriers to entry for writing a web application?",1205759187

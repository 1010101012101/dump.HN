The lessons aren't the main aspect of the platform, just a really cool free feature we offer.<p>Look at it this way: Facebook rolls out new product updates all the time. Where do you go if you are a non-tech savvy person to learn how to use these new features? If you're non-tech savvy you won't be reading mashable or hacker news.<p>The lessons are just a cool way to entice our free userbase into using the platform. The actual platform itself is meant to be considered an all-in-one tool that recommends new people to follow, offers insight and feedback on content the user is publishing, and also has an awesome free database of knowledge for reference.<p>Essentially the free tool is a dumbed down version of the Pro tool. This will make a lot more sense when we go live with our 2nd round of beta testing in April. We could use all of the feedback we can get, so signup for our beta and we'd be glad to take your input. We are finishing up iteration on our first beta test now and will be ready to go in mid April.<p>Thanks for the feedback!",1332215976

3727765,comment,3726622,3726622,2,0,rmk2,,,"What irks me the most about the ""post pc era"" is its genesis. It is portrayed as a revolution that will fundamentally change computing.<p>However, by dubbing the tablet the ""post-pc"", its very definition still depends on the pc, being a definition ex negativo. Many of the arguments here are about whether the tablet can do <i>everything a pc does</i>.<p>The tablet does not revolutionise cultural artifacts or cultural goods, it merely allows for a consumption that is somewhat different from the consumption the pc offers. The consumed goods do not change, social media, media, art and science remain exactly the same, namely consumable goods.<p>The established dichotomy between the pc and the tablet is a fake one, used to artificially create demand that can then be met through new supplies.<p>The tablet does not change the mode of production, it is merely another facet of consumption, this time even more openly advertised as such by being advertised a ""consumer device"".<p>Calling it innovation is in my opinion a misrepresentation, because it basically reinvents the wheel once more, it undergoes the same syntheses and evolution as the pc did, just accelerated thanks to already available knowledge.<p>The tablet is a clever remix of technologies already available. It combines different modes of consumption previously divided, but it only changes the mode of reception, not production.<p>True innovation on the other hand has to change the modes of production first. The tablet cannot achieve anything other items cannot <i>also</i> do, and is thus not innovation or revolution, it is merely evolution, or even just another playing field added alongside others.<p>Film, recorded music, books and the radio changed the means of production, as did the pc. The walkman, the tablet and the tv may have changed the modes of reception, but nothing new can be created through them that wasn't already available beforehand and is merely refined, not substantially altered.<p>The ""war"" of tablets vs pc is just another sales pitch to make either more appealing to their individual audiences.<p>>> edit (for ease of understanding, an example)<p>As an example that is less abstract, take the ""Hipster"". Wearing clothing that is tattered might be ""cool"" to you and you wear it ""ironically, as a statement"". If you are poor however, you might have to wear tattered clothes because you lack the means to afford something else. Ironically or not, you are fundamentally still wearing tattered clothes. Irony does not influence the plane of action, but instead the plane of ideas, or in other words: ideology. It's the same in the debate of tablet vs pc: Whether you type a blog-post on your touchscreened tablet or with a keyboard on your pc doesn't change the underlying action, just the mode of action. Whether you prefer one over the other is ideology, the basic action remains unchanged.<p>>> end edit",1332215931

3727759,comment,3726164,3726948,5,0,beambot,,,"According to reports, Kiva raised around $33 Million in VC funding [1].  Like I wrote before [2]:<p><i>I've been tracking venture capital (VC) funding of robotics companies for the better part of two years.  Based on my (limited) data, VC funding in robotics exceeded $160 Million for 2011.  This is just a rounding error compared to VC funding of Internet (web-based) companies, which hit a decade-long high of $6.9 Billion in 2011.  My hope is that robotics will get more love in the next year(s), but getting VC funding for robotics is a decidedly tough nut to crack.  Robotics companies have large capital requirements for robot hardware, few potential acquirers, and almost no ""Google-scale"" breakout success stories (ie. IPOs).  I mean, c'mon... one of the best known robotics companies, iRobot, has a market cap of just $700 Million.  This makes robotics a difficult sell to your typical VC firm.  My hope is that this list can give others courage to pursue ""swing for the fences"" type projects along with a source for robotics-friendly VC firms.</i><p>So this acquisition is good news for robotics, and _exceeded_ the entire market cap of iRobot.  Like I mentioned in a previous comment, I hope Amazon doesn't hoard Kiva to itself and rob the world of efficient, robotic warehouses.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hizook.com/blog/2012/03/19/breaking-news-amazon-acquires-kiva-systems-775-million-cash"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hizook.com/blog/2012/03/19/breaking-news-amazon-a...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.hizook.com/blog/2012/03/01/venture-capital-vc-funding-robotics-2011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hizook.com/blog/2012/03/01/venture-capital-vc-fun...</a>",1332215827

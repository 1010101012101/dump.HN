8686026,comment,8677556,8684122,0,0,fsloth,,,"&quot;Overall, the notion of LOC alone being a risk-metric absent any additional context seems an oversimplification.&quot;<p>Yeah, I agree completely. Didn&#x27;t think too long before answering there, I&#x27;m afraid. I confused the fact that in my experience increase of LOC correlates with increased risk of bugs with there actually being a causality between the said observables.<p>For me personally languages with higher LOC are harder to read, but this is just about the languages I like and not a generalization that can be applied to any language in general (i.e. Ocaml is nicer than C in this sense but APL or J would get me just terribly confused).<p>Basically, <i>of the languages I consider readable</i>, and when dealing with container operations, it&#x27;s easier for me to parse especially those that either have basic containers as fundamental data types in the language (e.g. Python, F#) or have a uniform syntax over typical algorithms and containers (Clojure) rather than verbose languages like C or Java.<p>In these instances, it&#x27;s not about the overall LOC count of the languages but the fact that they make common operations more legible and easier to reason with than C. I.e. they have less non-value adding burden typically. Why they are nicer, is not because of their LOC, though, but their LOC is a side-effect of their features that make them nice, I think.<p>Thanks for pointing this out :)",1417503198

Like archive.org, but with peer review by people who use it.<p>I&#x27;m sure that in principle it is possible. I mean, if you are interested in some domain you surely know few people who&#x27;s opinion you&#x27;d trust. They might not even be Ph.Ds, but they somehow got this good reputation, probably not by accident. So if somebody like this presses &quot;Like&quot; button under some article and leaves comment about what is trustworthy here and what isn&#x27;t, it probably will be as good (better, actually) for you, as opinion of Nature&#x27;s staff. And as these people by definition are interested in this domain as well, chances are they also will be interested to read this article and thus will be able to press &quot;Like&quot; button and leave a comment.<p>So, yeah, <i>in principle</i> it it possible, but I imagine it is really hard to do it <i>right</i>. Because essentially it is the same as any &quot;karma&quot; or &quot;rating&quot; system on some forum, and inventing proper rating system is really hard — it&#x27;s not the most knowledgeable people who usually have the highest rank on any thematic forum.

8686021,comment,8678336,8682277,0,0,cbsmith,,,"> Things like the maximum size of strings or integers are implementation limits. These should be kept separate from the language definition per se.<p>At least with integers, I think protobuf&#x27;s ability to specify 32-bit and 64-bit integers has been quite helpful.<p>> There are de facto different levels of portability of JSON data. A highly portable piece of JSON data confines itself not to exceeding certain limits, like ranges of integers. We could call that &quot;strictly conforming&quot;.<p>Yeah... and that&#x27;s how you get yourself in to problems. Life is simpler with one standard that either works or doesn&#x27;t. Easily the most annoying thing with protocol buffers is using unsigned integers because of Java&#x27;s signed integer foolishness. Yes, you can argue that&#x27;s a reason to have the &quot;strictly conforming&quot; concept, but I&#x27;d argue quite the opposite.<p>> Limits are different from other discrepancies among implementations because it is very clear what the behavior should be if the extended limit is supported. If an implementation handles integers beyond the JSON specified range, there is an overwhelming expectation that those representations keep denoting integers.<p>Hmm... I don&#x27;t think that is clear at all. In fact, it isn&#x27;t clear to me when I have to worry about floating point rounding potentially kicking in.<p>> This is different from situations where you hit some unspecified or undefined behavior, where an implementation could conceivably do anything, including numerous choices that meet the definition of a useful extension.<p>In practice, there seems to be little difference. While there might be some <i>idealized</i> behaviour that is expected, there appears to be plenty of wiggle room for a variety of behaviours for these &quot;not strictly conforming&quot; cases.",1417502915

Personally, I hate the word DevOps because no one knows what it means. Devops seems to mean different things to different people. If I were to define it, I guess I would say DevOps to <i>me</i> means, you want a hybrid sysadmin who knows how to program enough to work with configuration management, or you want a developer who knows enough about sysadmin bits to keep things stable and secure. If you look at most of the DevOps job postings, you will see they actually want someone who is 80% sysadmin + 20% developer. DevOps kind of seems like BS to me, since to be a good sysadmin, I think you should know how to use configuration management by default, you don&#x27;t need to be this hybrid position. So, long story short, AWS allows sysadmins or develops to use APIs to manage infrastructure through code. So someone who does &quot;devops&quot; should be able to use AWS. I also think, that if you are <i>devops</i> (whatever the sysadmin/developer ration), and don&#x27;t know how to use AWS (or other cloud providers), your job prospects are going to look pretty grim (non-existent) 10 years out.",1417501909

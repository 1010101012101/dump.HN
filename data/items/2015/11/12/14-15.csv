If the zones above those Cloudflare manages are RSA, it doesn&#x27;t matter if Cloudflare&#x27;s own zones are ECDSA.<p>4. ECDSA is itself outmoded and dangerous.[1]. Cloudflare has the first significant deployment of curve-based DNS on the Internet, and because of standards group torpor, they&#x27;re forced to use <i>bad</i> NIST-curve DSA, while the rest of the world has moved on to better curves and deterministic signatures.<p>5. It takes just a few hours to write a new draft for ED25519. Pretty much the entire browser vendor community agrees that TLS needs a standardized Curve25519; a draft for that was submitted over a year ago, and <i>still hasn&#x27;t made it out of committee</i> because of bikeshedding. Worse: browsers can enable Curve25519 piecemeal, because TLS is a negotiation protocol. DNS isn&#x27;t. Because DNSSEC advocates have pushed deployment of broken &#x27;90s crypto, it could take close to a decade to get Ed25519 deployable in DNSSEC.<p>The idea that better DNSSEC crypto is just a standards document away is a pretty good illustration of what has gone wrong with 21+ years of attempted DNSSEC standardization.<p>There&#x27;s a better alternative than DNSSEC, and it isn&#x27;t DNSCurve: it is literally &quot;do nothing&quot;. Don&#x27;t break the Internet. Don&#x27;t create a massive new deployment of embarrassing old curve crypto. Don&#x27;t effectively sign keys over to the NSA. Billions of dollars of commerce flow over the Internet every week and none of it, not one bit, is protected by DNS security. DNSSEC isn&#x27;t useful, it isn&#x27;t needed, it certainly isn&#x27;t a priority.

Therefore, charging must occur at a pretty high frequency that we can&#x27;t hear.

It’s caused, he wrote, by two psychological processes. The first, selective attention, kicks in when you’re struck by a new word, thing, or idea; after that, you unconsciously keep an eye out for it, and as a result find it surprisingly often. The second process, confirmation bias, reassures you that each sighting is further proof of your impression that the thing has gained overnight omnipresence.<p>> The considerably catchier sobriquet Baader-Meinhof phenomenon was invented in 1994 by a commenter on the St. Paul Pioneer Press’ online discussion board, who came up with it after hearing the name of the ultra-left-wing German terrorist group twice in 24 hours. The phrase became a meme on the newspaper’s boards, where it still pops up regularly, and has since spread to the wider Internet. It even has its own Facebook page. Got all that? Don’t worry.

They look at trends, momentum, traction, etc. It doesn&#x27;t help that they are investing other people&#x27;s money.<p>There&#x27;s some logic to that: they can&#x27;t invest the time and effort to understand all the problems in all the industries inside out. As a result, they look for proxies. The flip side is they get bitten by Goodhart&#x27;s law. They end up being adversely selected by founders who mimic the signals the VCs have learned to pick up on.<p>Technology X is trending? Problem Y is a big problem? They&#x27;ll fund a company that applies X to solve Y without asking themselves if X <i>can</i> actually solve Y or isn&#x27;t even suited to solve Y. It&#x27;s harder to be gamed if instead of following such trends you focus - as YC seems to be doing - on founder based signals. But people learn to mimic those signals too.<p>Signals which are costly to fake tend to be better. So investors will pay close attention to those. For instance, working full time on a project pre-seed investment instead of being payed for a full time job is a costly proposal, and thus potentially a good signal for investors. The flip side is that it can be faked by people with mediocre skills and no real opportunity cost, or people who are otherwise financially secure.",1447339932

That&#x27;s mobbing and it&#x27;s wrong.<p>Are we even looking at the same videos from FIRE? All I see is one woman screaming at one man in a crowd. ONE, not two, not three, not many. ONE person is screaming in the FIRE video. Secondly, where in the videos is anyone spitting on the Yale staffer?<p>Also, lets talk about disrupting events. That&#x27;s what even my dad (an old hippie) would call a protest. Mind you, my dad is more conservative these days (a Catholic and the like), but I&#x27;m sure he wouldn&#x27;t call modern protests mobbing either. Disrupting events to raise awareness to grievances (whether or not they&#x27;re genuine) isn&#x27;t immoral. I think that&#x27;s something you and I will never agree upon.<p>>Would you feel the same way if it was Tea Partiers doing the exact same things?<p>Yes, they can be as loud as they want, imo, and they have been already loud as they want. It seems you want to play a mind game where people should be silent unless it falls within your standard of legitimate complaint. You and I don&#x27;t get to decide what&#x27;s a legitimate complaint since we only do what&#x27;s good/bad for ourselves. If the some conservative Catholic organization wants to stage a protest to prevent ENDA from passing in Congress who am I to tell them otherwise? The 1st Amendment furnishes them such a right to peaceably assemble. If they&#x27;re rude or otherwise impolite about it, that&#x27;s a matter of mere taste/sentiment. It&#x27;s not a matter of law.<p>>These traditions are what allow people with strongly varying societal views to coexist peacefully in a large country such as this one.<p>You mean the tradition of silence is acceptable because it gives way to false peace? Really?<p>>The only alternatives to such traditions are either segregation or civil war.<p>&quot;Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.&quot; -- John F. Kennedy.<p>Simply put, if your views require everyone to remain silent or never raise their voice when the established order refuses to change, then you will get civil war. As for segregation, people already do that without raising their voices, Google white flight.<p>TLDR-version:<p>1. Can you show in the article&#x27;s FIRE video where anyone but one person is screaming? Also, what spitting (there&#x27;s none in the video)?<p>2. You&#x27;re making some faulty assumptions that the Tea Party movement didn&#x27;t have disruptive protests when in fact there were several small scale protests around 2010 throughout the US.<p>3. You want people to peacefully coexist, but you also want people to basically STFU unless you approve of their views. I&#x27;m not inclined to agree. People have the moral and legal right to protest. It&#x27;s not for you or me to decide.<p>4. What&#x27;s with this segregation and civil war hyperbole? You really think one screaming woman at Yale equals massive social disorder? Maybe you and I are not on the same page here, but I honestly think you&#x27;re being dishonest by this false equivalence.",1447339743

For color, we have just three receptors, lending perceived elements to be put in a nice three dimensional space. Now with smells, we have so many different and so specific receptors that there&#x27;s neither a canonical order for the receptors to be put across a dimension (the case with sound) or a dense set within a few dimensions (vision, taste).

So a well designed SSD controller will take advantage of that (including data striping, essentially turning your drive into a tiny RAID).  Of course it is not clear how good your consumer SSD drives are at that, but any server-grade drive you are using in your db server should support parallel reads.  It gets tricky though because it reads data so quickly it might saturate the io bandwidth even with a single request, I&#x27;ve never done that math.

Perhaps part of the problem is bad pricing. E.g. content that <i>ought</i> to be cheap (e.g. e-books, streaming video) tends to be more expensive or certainly insufficiently cheaper than content that ought to be more expensive (e.g. physical books, bluray disks).<p>Perhaps a big part of the problem is publishers &quot;pretending&quot; they add value.<p>Some publishers definitely add <i>some</i> value, but then they subtract value in other ways -- it&#x27;s great that the movie studio figures out who the good writers, directors, and actors are and risks its own money to make a good movie, but it&#x27;s bad that it&#x27;s provided on a bluray disk with annoying copy-and-other protection in a hard-to-open package, and that it&#x27;s more expensive to buy the cheaper to distribute and generally more convenient electronic version.

Mice that were fed a low-fiber diet developed less microbial diversity, but if they were put back on a high fiber diet, their microbial community recovered quickly. However, and most revealingly, if they gave birth to a litter while on a low-fiber diet (and therefore with a weak microbial community) the second generation mice were unable to develop a strong microbial community regardless of diet.<p>The conclusion is that microbes already present in one&#x27;s body can adapt according to diet. If a microbial species metabolizes fiber and the host does not consume fiber, the microbe will possibly enter a &quot;dormant&quot; (my invented term) state, but it can be recovered to full strength. Still, &quot;dormant&quot; microbes will not be prevalent in the birth canal to ensure transmission to the next generation, so that generation will not have that microbe species regardless of diet. Over generations, this could lead to extinction of entire microbial species.<p>THIS is the evolution that the article talks about, NOT genome evolution.<p>> In that time [decades] we&#x27;ll start altering the general human genome, and likely remove countless inherited conditions out of it either directly or indirectly.<p>What&#x27;s the rush? You&#x27;re talking about altering the human genome, something COMPLETELY IRREVERSIBLE in a single generation. This article asserts that an enormous part of our bodies was barely beginning to be researched five years ago! The reason this hubris is so common is that a few parts of our bodies are relatively simple and easily understood: the circulatory, respiratory and other systems that exist as meat. On the other hand we barely understand the many systems that live in a complex state of delicate equilibrium: endocrine, immune, and microbial which seems to be apart of both of them.",1447337207

Eyes and ears are so easy to quantify and abstract with quantities that we&#x27;ve been doing it for decades now. Even if our eyes are not literally CCDs and our ears are not literally microphones, they&#x27;re close enough for the quantifications to be useful. Touch and proprioception back to a geometric shape (our body) which provides obvious spatial abstractions (higher, lower, harder, softer, etc). Taste (considered separately from smell, which is normally a bad idea but bear with me here) is based on a small number of types of sensors (sweet/salt/sour/bitter/umami, if there&#x27;s one or two missing it doesn&#x27;t change things much).<p>Smell is hundreds or thousands of distinct sensor types for various chemical characteristics, with no <i>particular</i> relationship to each other. We don&#x27;t have a systematic coverage of some vector space of X dimensions, we have quasi-random point samplings that poorly populate an n-dimensional space. If it&#x27;s hard to get abstract concepts out of that, it could be because it really is mathematically demonstrably difficult to get useful abstraction out of that source of data. It sounds to me like even those cultures that happen to have them are still very, very weakly covered compared to vision or sound.",1447337175

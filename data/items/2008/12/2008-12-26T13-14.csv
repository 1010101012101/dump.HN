Pistol ALL THE WAY! Yes, I saw the video of the guy that accurately emptied his S&W in ½ a second. I also saw the shooting range and the crowd behind him, watching the event. Can he shoot and reload that way if he is in his car, driving with one hand and shooting with the other, while a bunch of scum bags in another car are shooting at him? Hey, maybe he can. I know I can’t. Can you?
Generally speaking, the revolver is more difficult to master than the pistol. The double action is hard and it affects speed and accuracy. It can be done, but I found that pistols are easier, as did many shooters. Also, even though they seem to be more simple, revolvers are not as rugged as service pistols, the mechanisms that cycles the cylinder and cocks the hammer is both complicated and fragile compared to auto pistols.
Before anyone starts casting evil voodoo spells at me for insulting their prized S&W or Ruger: I own revolvers and like shooting them, I just don’t think they are the best option for self defense, and I see that everyone I talk to in my country who is worried about security as I am also chooses pistols. Quality pistols resist sand, mud and dirt in general better than revolvers, where a small pebble locked in the mechanism may render the revolver inoperable.",1230299839

There are a few happy exceptions, but I would look more to Ph.D.s in linguistics or psychology (harder disciplines, and more evidence-based, than education in general) for advice on how to teach children to read.<p>Here are some sound resources on reading instruction:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Lets-Linguistic-Approach-Leonard-Bloomfield/dp/0814311156/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Lets-Linguistic-Approach-Leonard-Bloom...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Language-Development-Learning-Read-Scientific/dp/026263340X/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Language-Development-Learning-Read-Sci...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Dyslexia-Complete-Science-Based-Problems/dp/0679781595/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Dyslexia-Complete-Science-B...</a><p>So, yes, the problem with introducing programming into the K-12 curriculum is<p>a) figuring out how to teach it well to learners of that age of varying backgrounds and interest levels, and<p>b) figuring out what else gets crowded out of the curriculum.",1230299731

410154,comment,409728,409728,0,0,bitdiddle,,,"It's certainly important to know where Erlang doesn't perform so well. Project Euler ( <a href=""http://projecteuler.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projecteuler.net/</a> ) is also good for exploring the strengths of a given lanaguage. In terms of building robust and scalable distributed systems it cannot be touched. This stems for it's motivating use case of telephony. I'm not sure about Python but I know Haskell has been used largely in academic circles and hasn't had the same amount of attention paid to robustness.

410145,comment,405680,407531,0,0,yters,,,"Back to my question about the distribution, if IQ is just a rarity ordering metric based on rarity, then IQ testing is somewhat confused.  For example, say someone scoring 150 on an IQ test is rarer than someone scoring 160, they should be ranked higher according to your definition of the metric.  If the claim in the article that higher IQs occur more frequently than predicted, then something like this scenario is possible and IQ scores may be unreliable as a rarity ordering metric.<p>At any rate, is there quantitative metric for intelligence?",1230298257

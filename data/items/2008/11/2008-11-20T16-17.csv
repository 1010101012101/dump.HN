Enhancements have to be derived from the requirements and design that the customer bought off on, or we require more money. Bugs that interfere with our commitments to the customer, on the other hand, are handled with extreme prejudice.</i><p>My employer (who works in a highly regulated industry) works the same way.  If a core product must be modified, we issue a change control memo.  The items in the memo either have to be tied to bugs in our bug-base or, in the case of enhancements, a specification.<p>Because of the high volume of paperwork that surrounds software releases (specifications, documentation, test matrices, test reports), enhancements are typically put into a stack until there are enough to justify the load of paperwork that must accompany such a release.  Bug fixes still require paperwork, but specs don't need to be written, only test reports.",1227200254

370716,comment,370638,370638,0,0,felideon,,,"Although I do agree bugs may be pushed to the vast abyss of feature requests or ""enhancements,"" the answer is pretty simple:<p>In the waterfall model, if it isn't in the requirements/specifications doc, it isn't a bug.  It's put in as feature request and if you're lucky maybe some day years later it will be addressed in a redesign project or a ""phase 2"", but most of the time it will never happen.<p>In agile, if it's not a story, you put it in the backlog and it will eventually make it into an iteration.  For example, as testers, we bring it up to the PM/PO so that he can write a story for it.  They'll prioritize and put it in an iteration because the developer will not do anything about it unless it's a story and his time accounted for it.",1227199281
370715,comment,370638,370697,0,0,swombat,,,"And before people down-mod me because I forgot to mention it, the reason why Jeff is perceiving that something is horribly broken there is not because there's a problem with classifying what kind of ""request"" the user made. If your developers are in the habit of ignoring feature requests because they're not bugs, you need either new developers or a new project manager.<p>""Work items"" (whatever kind they are) should be implemented based on the value they add to the product, the company, the customers, etc. Bugs can be minor and requirements can be critical.<p>In the case Jeff discusses, yes, it's a bug, because it should match the requirements, which presumably include providing customers with the tools to build quality Windows applications. Is it a critical bug? Depends on the point of view. From a developer point of view it's not critical, and they are right to ignore it from that narrow perspective. ""Critical bug"", in developer-speak, means ""The sky will fall when someone clicks that button"". However, it should be critical to the windows UI guidelines team and they should be the stakeholder pushing to get it implemented, on the basis that it makes them look like dunces.<p>So the problem there is not about what you call the bug, it's about the fact that the windows UI guidelines team don't care enough (a fact more than obvious whenever I stare at a vista screenshot).",1227199278

370691,comment,369932,370429,0,0,astine,,,"Part of the problem is, that the higher you force the wage, the fewer employees a company can employ. So, when unions push wages (and pensions) too high, it prevents the companies from hiring as many employees. In the case of UAW and GM, it went so far that GM was forced to close down factories and many UAW workers lost their jobs as a result.<p>A better way to improve wages and income for workers is to improve  their productivity, that is, their subjective worth in relation to the employer, as wages tend to naturally approach this value. Tis is best done by increasing the quantity and quality available to the workers. Effectively this means increasing innovation, which GM and Ford have not been able to provide for years.  UAW is part of the problem here as well.<p>Not that unions are all bad, workers should have a negotiating body in order to prevent abuse by employers, but I think that in this case they are part of the problem.",1227198055

This takes a bit of money, connections and being able to demonstrate you will have volume.<p>What the article doesn&#x27;t mention is that you can manufacture in Apple&#x27;s wake. After Apple started purchasing 4&quot; touch panels and LCD displays for iPhones, and then larger displays for the iPad, the capacity increased and prices went down. Same with all the CNC machines purchased for the iPhone 4 frame - they are no longer being used to manufacture Apple devices, but they are being used to manufacture other devices.<p>Second part is that modern manufacturing tech means you can have lean hardware startups. As much as cheap hosting, software as a service, etc. have made software app development cheaper manufacturing tech has made hardware manufacturing cheaper. You can now get rolling with complete custom hardware in thousands of units (as opposed to millions) with 6-figures in capital.<p>The key is knowing one of the small number of people who understand design, materials, the capabilities at the ODM&#x27;s, the right people at these companies, supply chain etc. and have them design the product to fit the current manufacturing capacity without requiring customization. It is easy to hire an industrial designer sitting ten thousand kilometers away from Shenzhen who can CAD something nice, but knowing that manufacturing that fancy designed device would cost extra millions in tooling and setup is where the real skill is. Good ID people can design great products and in a way where they can be manufactured easily and with a smaller investment. If you don&#x27;t have one of these people on your team, your either going to get something that is <i>very</i> ordinary looking (think Chinese knockoff) or you&#x27;ll attempt something ambitious, run out of money and fail.<p>What Nest did is use clever ID to create a product that looked unique without over-stretching the manufacturing requirements.

In an mutually-agreed exchange, there is no reason a party who is giving money is inherently more entitled to special treatment from the other party beyond the express terms of the exchange. If I am giving my &quot;hard-earned money&quot; in to someone in exchange for the fruits of their labor (whether that&#x27;s a service or a good, and whether its the direct fruit of their <i>personal</i> labor or that of labor that they have purchased with <i>their</i> &quot;hard-earned money&quot;), I am no more entitled to have them bend over backward for me than the reverse.<p>Now, admittedly, if the service I am purchasing from them is a servant-like attitude, then, sure, I am entitled to that -- that&#x27;s what I am buying. But if I want some other good or service, <i>plus</i> a servant-like attitude, I should expect to pay extra for the extra I&#x27;m getting. And since I value my hard-earned money -- it being hard-earned and all -- I am unlikely to wish to pay the premium that makes that worthwhile except when it does something particular to enhance the value of the base good or service that it accompanies.",1411058197

The client generates a random password, encrypts it with the server&#x27;s public key, and sends it to the server. Only anyone with the private key can decrypt the message, and that should only be the server.<p>Now you don&#x27;t want to hand over this private key to Cloudflare if you don&#x27;t need to, because then they can read all traffic. Up until now, you needed to.<p>What they did was take the private key and move it to a keyserver, owned by your bank or whomever. Every time the Cloudflare server receives a random password (which is encrypted with the public key) it just asks the keyserver &quot;what does this encrypted message say?&quot; After that it has the password to the connection and can read what the client (the browser) is sending, and write data back over the same encrypted connection. Without ever knowing what the private key was.<p>The connection from Cloudflare to your bank&#x27;s webserver and keyserver can be encrypted in whatever way. It could be a fixed key for AES, it could be another long-lasting TLS connection (the overhead is mostly in the connection setup)... this isn&#x27;t the interesting part and can be solved in a hundred fine ways.<p>Edit: Removed my opinion from this post. Any downvotes for my opinion would also push the explanation down (which I hope is useful to some). I mostly agree with the other comments anyway.",1411057245

It is mostly used by angel investors to invest in very young startups for which it is too hard to put a valuation on them. The conversion of the convertible note debt into equity happens at series A investment by venture capitalists. Often the convertible note holders get a discount on the valuation, to compensate for putting in their money earlier. There may also be time limits on the conversion or a cap on the valuation.<p>Example: Angel invests $500K in startup in convertible note form, startup raises 10M from venture capital firm at 90 million pre-money valuation later. The VC firm ends up with 10% of the equity, because 10 million is 10% of 100 million post-money valuation (90m pre + 10m invested). The angel will receive 500K / 100 million = 0.5% of equity if there is no cap or discount. If there is say a 50% discount, the angel gets 500K / 50 million = 1% equity so double the equity. Same effect would be if there is a cap of the conversion valuation at 50 million, i.e. no matter what valuation the VCs invest at the angel gets at least 1% of equity because 500K / 50 million = 1%.<p>Hope it makes sense.",1411056428

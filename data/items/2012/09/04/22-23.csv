It's several times what I spend on clothes in <i>several</i> years.  There's a far less expensive option that's highly satisficing.  Suits, once an inexpensive, practical, standardized alternative to more ornate and expensive clothing, are now the expensive, frequently impractical attire. The lead time to purchase is too long.  And a far lower grade of tailoring is more than sufficient for virtually any occasion.  That's basic facts.<p>There are exceptions -- people for whom the expense is neither extravagent nor unneccessary.  It's a pretty small crowd, well within the top 1%, and probably more like the top 0.01%.  Then divide by two, because, well, very few women wear suits (though women's fashion is its own discussion).<p>As TFA notes, bespoke tailoring doesn't scale.  And it strongly suggests a rather fragile relationship between the garment and the wearer -- I can change in multiple of 25 separate measurements within a few months to a years time -- does this render a suit poor-fitting?<p>The made-to-measure alternative exists, and for many or most, it's a more-than-acceptable alternative for either formal or casual clothing.  With correctly chosen measuring points, and if necessary, some additional tailoring, garments can be made to fit quite well.  Cloth is pretty fungible.  Sticking to conservative fashions, styles, and cuts means you'll have something that will wear well for years.  And in a world in which off-the-rack sizing is increasingly problematic (aggressively styled cuts with little sizing leeway result in more frustrated customers), it's increasingly an option.  There are a few vendors in the space, though I feel it's still waiting for its true visionary.",1346799114

4476938,comment,4463778,4463778,1,0,blazing_grey,,,"I second/third/47th the recommendations for Thinkpads. Everything people say here regarding graphics drivers is true, unfortunately.<p>You will have problems with pulseaudio hosing video playback timing and a host of other stuff if you run Ubuntu. My solution is to just remove pulseaudio entirely, which forces me to use an alsa-based volume widget, but that's pretty trivial and the hard volume keys work out of the box.<p>If you get thermal issues, pull the machine apart and make sure the heatsink is applied correctly - on my T400 there was a serial # sticker over one edge of the CPU die that was holding the heatsink away from the die. Also, the cooling air intakes have filters that get dirty easily and make a massive difference to cooling efficiency (the fan isn't just pulling air from inside the case as things appear).<p>As for keyboards, the keyboard on my T400 is my favorite on any computing device I have right now. The layout on the W520 my employer provided is the same as the T400, which is basically the same as it's been forever, but the keyfeel is a lot more rubber-dome-y than the T400 which feels highly mechanical.<p>The other thing I'll say for Thinkpads is that after a few years of maintaining my wife's laptops, I was pleasantly surprised on opening up my T400 to clean out it's heatsink that Lenovo's engineers actually didn't hate me and want me to die as is the case with other, fruitier manufacturers. There's still a good bit of ""remove WXYZ to get at A"", but these are much more maintainable machines than typical.",1346798873
4476937,comment,4476538,4476538,1,0,ilaksh,,,"This is interesting.<p>From the standpoint of maintaining the relevance of men, I'm not super worried about colleges being dominated by women because I don't see college as being a good way to stay up-to-date with job skills or even to learn more basic skills.  But maybe this is more a comment about the inadequacy of traditional learning (and my own issues with not finishing college) than it is about the concept of higher education in general or men and women.<p>My reasoning is this: I dropped out of college after about two years.  I had finished most of my general education requirements.  However, I don't feel as though the general education information was mainly focused on really relevant knowledge or skills.  Some of it was definitely important, but a lot of it was either outdated, not particularly relevant or important, or much further in depth than I needed to go.  That also goes for the classes related to computer science that I took.<p>I taught myself the most important skills that I have ever acquired in my life, computer programming, before I entered high school.<p>I also don't think that the mechanism of learning in college is very efficient.  In other words, here are some books, some lectures, and some tests.  Everyone is expected to go the same pace.  I feel that online environments and self-paced computer based training are much more efficient and useful, and more practical for obtaining the newest skillsets.<p>Anyway that is a little bit out of the way of the main topic perhaps, but it might be more relevant than you think.  I think there may be quite a few males who are taking a path similar to my own which involves more hands on self training, quite possibly lots of them in technology related fields.  I also think that there may be significantly more men who are inclined to start their own businesses.<p>So I guess I am not really worried about becoming irrelevant just yet.<p>If I get a degree it will mostly be so that people can't hold the lack of it over my head for the rest of my life, rather than because there is a degree program that really has value from a learning perspective.",1346798871

The log in to the existing account link is under the border of the main container, presumably because of fixed height css.<p>Issue 2: /hilo/register: Unable to click on the button you need to click on to register - looking back, this is untrue, you seem to be using ajax calls to load pages and send information, but without any kind of notification, so to the user it merely feels unresponsive.<p>Issue 3: Your images are not locally hosted, IE, your encryption on your SSL appears as broken. This is more damaging than having no SSL to none developers, etc, who whilst are not your target audience, will instinctively distrust your website. Either load them locally or through an image host with https.<p>Issue 4: /hilo/dashboard: Too much on the screen for a first time user, consider a simplified dashboard with the option to unlock all features, while you run new users through a simple (but not <i>required</i>) tutorial.<p>Issue 5: /hilo/dashboard: No idea at all where to click until 30 seconds of mouse movement, there is no indication at all that the links you are using are in fact links, they look like (and are) simply black text.<p>Issue 6: /hilo/cloud_accounts: Silly scrollbar appearing in the cloud accounts area once adding the first cloud account, consider using no margin and having the padding and the width all add up to <i>> 100%</i> to remove this issue. Also, the EDIT and DELETE links look quite ugly.<p>Issue 7: There is no clear aim for what you really want me to do, I am pretty much following difficult to find requirements with no reasoning behind it and no explanation of what this will all do, your average user would already have quit the site and would be looking for ""X but simpler"".<p>Issue 8: /hilo/cloud_accounts/create What you asked me to do on the last page took me back to creating a new cloud account here, feels like I'm going in circles, completely lost as a user, closed the browser window, will never open again.<p>Criticism aside, some constructive... criticism?<p>I like the look of the app, it feels tailored to your clients, very nice and technically working app.<p>Feels like you are doing too much at once, it needs simplifying for the new guys, consider a sandbox approach, treat your users like idiots till they decide they should be let out of the cage.<p>Definitely let the user know what to do next, I got lost and left and I was pretty determined to follow through.<p>Let the user log in prior to confirming registration but again, sandbox them until they do, because having to open my dummy email account was a real pain in the ass.<p>Feels like it's almost ready, just some tweaking really now :)<p>And you're welcome.",1346798235

Since Neal and I hadn't really built a professional site before, we didn't really know what we were doing and it was pretty damn hard. Luckily we got a lot of help from our instructor and other advisors who were developers and designers to lighten the load a bit. Still the main product was ours and it was definitely an MVP - <a href=""http://bit.ly/PZpoSt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/PZpoSt</a><p>August 2011<p>By August I was down to about $200 in my account and we had still not received the funding we thought we would to market Code Academy to the masses. So we just decided to launch the site and see how many people we could get to apply by using Twitter, Facebook, sending emails, and going to meetups in Chicago. We launched Thursday, August 4th 2011 at 9am looking for 12 students to fill our inaugural class.<p>While we had the benefit of having a lot of support within the Chicago community, the applications we were getting were from complete strangers. We were getting applications from realtors, retail workers, lawyers, accountants, journalists, teachers, etc. They were also coming from across the country. California, Texas, North Carolina, Florida, Wisconsin, New York, the list goes on. Even people from outside the country (Israel and The Philippines) applied to our inaugural class!<p>By the end of August we had 88 quality applications from people all over the world without spending a single dollar on marketing.<p>September-October 2011<p>From there, we decided to accept 35 students instead of 12 and we started our first class in October 2011 with two web development courses instead of one.<p>I think the biggest reason why we were able to generate so much interest was the fact that we were addressing the right problem at the right time. There were so many people out there looking for a program like ours, but it just wasn't there yet. When our inaugural students heard about Code Academy, they jumped at the opportunity.",1346796993

Perhaps, if you made a theme of very similar colors, you could achieve the same benefit from programming. Although I suspect it might not work because the difference in the colors has to have significance for your brain to really start paying attention to it. So you could have a color-sensitive language. Or maybe color could be the only significant thing, then you could just bind each character to a color in your text editor and use a normal language.<p>While walking in the wood today and looking at the detail on the ground and searching for ripe fruit in the trees I was thinking about how our brains are really good at picking out specific visual things from noise and how more complex visual things are sometimes easier to recognize than simpler things. Also its possible to get really good at picking out subtle clues from very complex input: think about a native American Indians ability to track moving animals over long distances.<p>So I think what would be really cool is to have a way of representing each function of a program as a visual form, ideally a 3-dimensional one. You could then look at these form and over time you would start to be able to see certain things about the function just by looking at the forms. I wonder if that might be a much faster way of searching for specific things within a large body of code such as you might do in a security audit than actually reading through all the code because it taps into the innate concurrency of the right-hemisphere.<p>There would be some difficulty would be in generating appropriate visual forms. The form has to be meaningful. The ideal would be if it were meaningful to the point where somebody well used to them could write the code a form represented just by looking at the form or, at least, infer the gist of it. Of course you dont have to limit yourself to one form per function, you could have 10 different forms per function, each representing different properties, or forms generated from by dividing the code in lots of different ways (not just functions). Or maybe you could simplify everything Im saying here and just have a lot more statistical static analysis of code then displayed with charts and infographics.",1346796832

Just a 3D scanner setup, which can amount to an old projector and some webcams. We should be able to use technology from 3D motion capture to build a physical model of someone's skeleto-muscular system. The hard part would be the domain knowledge.

Part of what is disappointing is that until they don't release reasonable amount of data. Forget innovation, nothing will come of it.<p>Case in point is that I'm interested in finding out good schools that my daughter can go to.<p>I've had a look at EduBase. I can't tell if a school is any good or not. Or if they would admit my child or not. I can get more information from <a href=""http://www.dcsf.gov.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dcsf.gov.uk</a> or go to the local council website and download the admissions criteria.<p>Every school has a different admission criteria. Some care about how close you live to the school, some about where you worship or how christian you are. So if you have a child who is close to school going age and you want to work out what is the best school to send him/her to, you need to do lots of leg work. I thought about building such an app.<p>I don't understand what you can do with the address, name of school, pupil age and head teacher name.

Go out and get a job at an actual established mid-sized company (ie: not just some other startup).  Do that for about 3-4 years (not too long, but more than a year).<p>It is extremely valuable (IMO) for both the MBA and the found-a-startup tracks to know what a ""real"" business is supposed to look like and work like.<p>Learn about all the socio-political stuff that goes on in a typical organization<p>Learn about sales, booking sales, recognizing revenue and other aspects of cash flow<p>Learn about product design, development, testing, etc.<p>Learn about manufacturing, shipping, operations, logistics.<p>Basically, you get the idea.

I am currently in college right now but cannot take the database class for another two semesters because the required prerequisites.<p>The issue that troubles me is appropriately organizing tables and efficiently organizing the information.  I am familiar with normalization and some of the basic concepts involved with such but I feel as though I am missing some possible rules of thumb or methods that individuals go about when designing the databases.<p>For example, take a site like HN or Digg, what would be the appropriate way to organize user accounts, profiles, each submitted site, the comments for each site, etc.  Logically, I would think that if a user made a comment, it would be appropriate to insert that comment into both the table for the user as well as the table for the site be commented on, but that may be an extremely naive approach to handling such a task. I understand that to most here this seems as though it is most likely an obvious question but if I had definitive knowledge to make an educated decision, I would do so.<p>Ideally I would love some quality online resources or a simple explanation over the way you hackers go about the design phase.  Good books would be appreciated but I am tight on cash so nothing too pricey.<p>Thanks for any responses you guys give.  I understand this is quite a noob question and there might be a more appropriate forum out there for such a query, but I really value the analysis from most of this community. Cheers!",1215036352
234614,comment,234026,234494,0,0,bkovitz,,,"Indeed I am framing this as a rational rather than emotional problem.<p>I think you made a very good point about the difference in the way extraverts and introverts enter new social situations.  That really does make a huge difference: just dive in, mess up, and adjust (a lot like, say, running a start-up). That will get the learning process going. I think there's another element, though: that incomprehension of ""lite"" social interaction.<p>Regarding the courage hypothesis, here's how I've often heard it put: ""Oh, don't be afraid, don't care what other people think, just say what you really want to say.""  To me, this misses what's happening.  What's really happening is simply not having a clue how to participate.  A dial tone on the brain.  The reason, if I pick up a guitar, I don't play music, isn't because I'm afraid to, but because I don't know how to play guitar.  I tried going to bars a bunch (I seem to have lots of social courage), but I didn't really get anywhere until some friends explained various social protocols: posture, how to make physical contact, how to pick out clothes, what to <i>not</i> talk about (decorators in Python, cryonics), etc.<p>Here's a weird piece of evidence: extraverts have exactly the same feeling of disorientation in our world.  Get a strong extravert into a conversation that pursues something in depth (not so much breadth), and they get a dial tone on the brain, too.  They quickly bail, the same way introverts bail out of social situations.<p>Hmm... mild autism.  Maybe that's what I've got (and many other shy, geeky people).  That's a new angle, and it might be right.<p>Another possibility: optimal stimulation level.",1215036302

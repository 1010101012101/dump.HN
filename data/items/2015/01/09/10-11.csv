If the initial impression is good then they will spend the hour trying to find your good points and vice versa.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t technical interviews be different? No, not really. In general the interviewer will give more hints to people he likes and more follow up questions to people he dislikes. After enough hints even the worst candidate will find the solution and get extra points for good collaborative skills. Similarly even the best candidate will stumble sooner or later and gets a mark for being argumentative if pressured enough.<p>Also notice how everyone says &quot;We care about the thought process and not if the solution actually works!&quot;. This allows for their subjectivity to reign supreme. Things like &quot;Your solution is wrong but I love your thought process!&quot; or &quot;Your solution is better than mine but you didn&#x27;t think things through enough before implementing it&quot; can be said about everything.<p>It is of course not that hard to do technical interviews correctly, you just need to have hard rules on what to accept and what to reject, what hints to give and when to give them etc. Any leeway for subjectivity will be abused by your subconscious.",1420800898

The CIA world factbook (the source of the WP information) uses &quot;age 15 and over can read and write.&quot; The CIA World Factbook uses an estimate for the US 99% figure and does not give any explanation how they get that figure.<p>It&#x27;s an estimate from census data.  There are problems with that estimation.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_in_the_United_States</a><p>> <i>The Census Bureau reported literacy rates of 86% based on personal interviews of a relatively small portion of the population and on written responses to Census Bureau mailings. They also considered individuals literate if they simply stated that they could read and write, and made the assumption that anyone with a fifth grade education had at least an 80% chance of being literate.</i><p>That feels like a pretty big flaw when we know that rates of literacy for 8th graders are below 50%. And the numbers are far worse when we look at math.<p>You are right: testing is important.  The problems with testing are bad teachers can teach only to the test and lessons that could be about general problem solving approaches turn into &quot;guess which answer is more likely from the multiple choice selection&quot; - a less useful skill.<p>The other problem with tests is explaining the tests to adults.  Two examples here. i) the extensive discussion about common core math. ii) England teaches &quot;synthetic phonics&quot;.  To make sure pupils are using real synthetic phonics to read and not just learning whole words the tests use nonsense words.  This tests a child&#x27;s ability to sound out the letters and then smoosh those sounds together.  This caused some confusion in parents.",1420800634

The GOP harp on about lower taxes and immigration, and the Dems talk about economic equality and healthcare. The ACA helps the middle-class but the political gridlock ensures that the president, or anyone else, can&#x27;t force through effective change.<p>Commonly cited are campaign finance and lobbying and polarisation but those are merely the symptoms of the deeper problem which is the US constitution. A messy compromise, the US constitution effectively gives veto to tiny states (Senate seating). Gerrymandering at the state level ensures that safe seats, and worse, incumbents who have to defend themselves from the ideological &#x27;purists&#x27; of their own party. Not a recipe for pragmatic government, vide Brownback, Kansas.<p>I still look forward to the spectacle of the 2016 general but even if Warren were to be the president (a far off prospect, even though she is what the US needs), little real and effective change would come about because she&#x27;d be stymied at ever corner.

Basically this is not very accurate, and familiarity with history of the Middle East and North Africa (including ideologies like Arab nationalism and Ba&#x27;athism, or figures like Gamal Abdel Naseer and Hafez al Assad) would show that it certainly can come from within the Islamic world-- primarily because the Islamic world are the prime targets and overwhelmingly the majority of the victims of these actions.<p>> Their rationale is that the same beliefs are shared by the majority.<p>Their rationale is also that the majority of Muslims are hypocrites and are not &quot;real&quot; Muslims (when compared to those who follow the extremists&#x27; perverse Wahabbi fiqh within the Sunni Hanbali maddhab) or else they would agree with them. Unless we haven&#x27;t noticed, the prime victim of Islamic extremism is other Muslims, and the prime opposition towards Islamic extremism is other Muslims. To go even further, the primary enemy of ISIS is actually Al Qaeda (in the form of Jabhat al Nusra) and vice versa.<p>When they say there is no moderate or extremist Muslim, it is because the moderate Muslim does not recognize the extremist as a Muslim, and the extremist does not recognize the moderate as a Muslim. Even the Muslim extremists do not recognize other Muslim extremists as Muslim if they do not pledge allegiance.<p>There is a reason why these extremist folk are called &quot;Takfiris&quot;-- it literally means &quot;those who accuse others of disbelief.&quot; Here [1] is a video between the Western-backed terrorists in Syria and ISIS on a two-way radio call. Pay close attention from about 40s, especially when the Western-backed terrorists ask the ISIS fighters why they do not attack Israel<p>As an anecdote: In Iraq a fatwa was issued by Ayotallah Sistani to refer to ISIS as &quot;Daesh al Murtad&quot; (&quot;ISIS who has left Islam&quot;) but it was eventually brought down to &quot;Asa&#x27;ib daesh&quot; (&quot;the gangs of ISIS&quot;) so as to avoid the &quot;moderates&quot; receiving the takfiri labeling as it is considered inflammatory.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbY9uU3kQc0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbY9uU3kQc0</a>",1420800447

North Koreans are not going to get any more food on the table even if I stop eating altogether.

Compression is then applied to only those frequencies and then they are summed together.<p>There is no pitch shifting in multiband compression - pitch shifting involves moving the frequency up or down by a number of cents, semitones, octaves etc. It&#x27;s the effect used to get the &quot;chipmonk&quot; voice (high-pitch and squeaky) where a normal voice is fed into a pitch shifter and it is shifted up or down.

8861528,comment,8860738,8861145,0,0,vidarh,,,">  having rich neighborhoods get better schools is more stupid. All schools should get the same. We fund all schools equally, across the board, no questions.<p>Schools in poor neighbourhoods needs <i>more</i> money if we want the kids to get an education of similar quality.<p>The reason being that running a school with students from poor households to a standard that gives the same education as students from rich households <i>costs a lot more money</i>. Some examples (based on my experience in the UK) of the extra costs schools have or may have with lower income families (some of which are covered with extra grants from the local council in the case of the UK, some of which they have to cover from discretionary funds):<p>* School breakfast or dinners. This is perhaps one of the most vital ones. If you charge for meals in the school, either you need to provide vouchers or some other means to make it accessible to poorer families, or their kids fall behind as a result of some of them not eating through the day. If you don&#x27;t serve meals in school, including breakfast, you can assume that kids from poor families will perform substantially worse on average.  My sons school to their credit chose to prioritize free meals to all students to avoid having to deal with visibly separate treatment of the kids.<p>* School trips. My sons school asks for a specific &quot;donation&quot; instead of demanding payment whenever possible, again to avoid having to means test and deal with excluding kids from trips because of parents who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t prioritise the cost of the trips. They&#x27;ll make it very clear that too few paying will lead to cancelled trips, but so far that has never happened, but they do have to regularly dip into discretionary funds to cover shortfalls.<p>* Families with disabled or special needs kids or disabled carers are more likely to either be low income (as a result of parents with disabilities that reduce their earnings potential) or have stretched finances (as a result of additional costs of care), and so more likely to live in poorer neighbourhoods. Same for families where the parents have all kinds of problems that affect the kids, such as alcohol or dug addiction etc.. This tends to result in substantially higher costs for all kinds of assistance programs for schools in poorer areas.<p>Even if you cover all of the extra costs, the kids in these families are still at a severe disadvantage on average due to all kinds of other factors (less likely to have role models with high education or that pushes them towards higher education, for example).<p>Giving kids actual equal education (instead of just trying to equalise <i>access</i> to same quality education) would require massive extra funding to poor neighbourhoods.",1420797913

I only mentioned this to show that Arabic is complex, especially for people who want to study the language in detail.<p>In older times however, most Arabs used to incorporate these short vowels into everyday speech. It was normal for them.<p>I find this somewhat fascinating because if I or any other casual speaker were to attempt to do this, we'd have to pause for at least a few seconds before each word to figure out which short vowel goes at the end of it.<p>It's pretty sad that Arabic speakers have gone backwards instead of advancing in the language, but I guess it's a price we must pay.",1313960288

The iPad is a tool and toy you probably don't need, but if used to the max it'll probably enhance your life in some noticable way.<p>Every single morning, while sipping coffee and waiting for my omelette to finish cooking, I catch up on the latest news through Reeder, the first RSS reader I've actually enjoyed using. I also check my mail to see if there's anything important I need to respond to right away.<p>When I'm finished eating and catching up to the latest news, I grab my iPad and go upstairs for my exercize. While doing strenght training I use my iPad to quickly make a note of how many reps and how much I lifted. After I'm done with my strenght training, I take a run either outside or on my threadmill. If I take the run on the threadmill, I'll use the iPad for watching a video, either South Park or TED.<p>After I've showered, groomed, brushed my teeth and flossed, it's time to start working. When I work my iPad is always lying on the desk next to my laptop. I use it for:<p>* Displaying my ToDo-list (the Hit List)<p>* Displaying the email I'm working on.<p>* Displaying some relevant notes to the work I'm doing (Evernote).<p>* Displaying a PDF or website containing documentation to what I'm working on.<p>* As an extra screen (AirDisplay) for Photoshop tool pads and similar.<p>* VNC or SSH to another computer<p>* The occational check of HN, Twitter or Facebook.<p>* Calculator<p>* Calendar (Week Cal HD)<p>Yup, everything I've mentioned could be done on a normal laptop. However, it's incredibly useful to have an extra screen for displaying relevant information that'll never be obscured by application windows covering the information.<p>After I'm satisfied with my work for the day, I might hang out with my friends, perhaps take a picnic in the park. My iPad is always accessible in my manpurse. If a customer has an emergency problem, I can quickly and easily log into their server and fix the problem (Textastic/Prompt). If I get a brilliant idea, I'll note it down in Evernote and analyse it with the Business Model app. Maybe I want to think deeply about my business - I'll just open Dropbox and read through some business documents about future plans or surf on some of my competitor's sites through Mercury Browser.<p>When I'm back home I might do some more work or chill out with some games. Perhaps I'll open Rage HD and have one of the most immersive and physically exhausting gaming experiences possible through the Virtual Window control mode.<p>Right before I go to bed, I write in my diary (Day One) and finish my TODO-list for tomorrow.",1313960229

Why not just nuke the company out of spite (or alternatively sell off all assets and give to charity if not spiteful) and have the CEO stay at the old place and keep doing the same thing. Same outcome but not as painfully dragged out.<p>Obviously if you keep doing multi billion dollar acquisitions, and then trash it all and fire everyone a couple years later when you switch CEOS, and then when things get even worse, fire that CEO with a golden parachute and bring it his cousin to do it all again, pretty soon your company headquarters are going to be an abandoned grassy field.<p>Talk about burn rate!",1313959465

For such a claim, we'd need some data over a longer term and for much of the world and not just for the US.  And we'd need more than the data:  We'd also need some good candidate explanations.  His article has no such and no references to any such.<p>Instead, with so little data, some of the best data is striking and not in the article:<p>Look at 'productivity', for the US and the world, in 'information technology'.  E.g., it was not so long ago that 1 billion bytes of disk was in a box about the size of a large SUV and would really set you back, and now can get 1 billion bytes in main memory for about $5, retail.  For just disk, about $100 will buy about 3 trillion bytes.  It may be that of the 1 billion byte boxes, they never sold in total as many as 3000 for 3 trillion bytes.  There was a time with reports that FedEx had, in total, 7 trillion bytes of disk.  Now that's about $300 in a mid-tower case for about $100, actually, a whole computer with four processor cores for less than $1000.  Did someone mention 'productivity'?<p>Think about telephones:  I well remember paying monthly telephone bills of well over $100.  Not anymore!  Think of mobile phones, useful in many trades, e.g., electricians and plumbers, nearly anyone who in their job spends a lot of time in a car:  A mobile phone used to be just some radio in, say, a police car; then a mobile phone was about the size of a brick; then a mobile phone would fit in a shirt pocket; now a mobile phone is a quite capable computer, Web browser, video camera, movie player, electronic funds transfer device, etc.<p>Think about tire life:  It used to be that 10,000 miles was good tire life.  Now can routinely get 80,000 miles.

""Look, Ma:  No more brake jobs!"".<p>Think about car engine life:  With all the computer controls, get much less gas and water in the oil and, thus, get much longer engine life.<p>Think about the changes in house building materials and tools:  Now can put up a house for many fewer worker hours.

They are HUGE, carrying oil, natural gas, or containers, with much better cost per ton-mile.<p>Bandwidth should count:  Kept track lately?  Now can put several trillion bits per second on one wavelength, some dozens of wavelengths on one long-haul fiber, maybe 144 fibers in one cable, and several cables along a road, pipeline, high voltage electric line, river, coastline, etc.<p>Remember the 'T-1 leased line' from Ma Bell?  That was 1.5 million bits per second (Mbps) for over $1000 a month.  Now for less than $60 a month I have 15 Mbps download speed and 2 Mbps upload speed.  For another $65 a month I can get a static IP address, 101 Mbps download speed, and 15 Mbps upload speed.

Did someone mention ""productivity""?<p>I still have a nice sack full of gorgeous Nikon camera equipment.  But it uses just film.  It's still okay, but now a digital sensor can have 48 million individual sensors, four for each pixel, that is, two for green and one for each of red and blue in a little square, giving 12 million pixels giving an array of 3000 by 4000 pixels.

Try to get the typing done?  Hope you never had to do that; commonly the typing was more work than the technical work.  Now with computers, Knuth's TeX, laser printers, and PDF, the typing is reasonable and routine.  The productivity gains here are some factors of 10; for technical writing, we're talking another Gutenberg.<p>Gotten a printed bank statement in the mail lately? I get my bank statements as PDF files over the Internet.  'Productivity' anyone?<p>It used to be that a bank had to physically sort the checks and have someone visually read the check and manually key in the amount.  Not anymore!  Now at a retail site, the 'check' is mostly just nonsense, just my receipt, and the transaction is all electronic.  The amount is keyed in at the cash register for the first and last time.  'Productivity'? anyone?<p>My driveway is steep, and last winter I needed tire chains to get out but had no tire chains.  But the Internet worked!  So, I ordered some tire chains from Amazon, got them, put them on, and drove out!  I didn't have to get towed out or drive to an auto parts store for the chains.  We were talking about 'productivity'?<p>Intel is now down to 14 nm line width (Atom processors), and has stated that they see their way clear to putting 1000 cores on a processor and having them work together effectively.  We were talking about what, 'productivity'?<p>Let's see:  The key to productivity is automation.  Now the key to automation is computer control.  Computer control is based on computer hardware, which keeps falling rapidly in price, and computer software.  The ability to develop software has increased enormously with progress in, e.g., Windows and .NET.  We just now have the computers, disk storage, operating systems, middle-ware, languages, libraries, networks, and Web services for some astounding progress:  We should be at the beginning of by a wide margin the greatest increase, in percentage and absolute terms, of productivity in all of history.<p>Now what was it we were talking about, hmm, 'productivity'?",1313958922

I started pocket computing with my USR palm 5000, upgraded to a palm III and then ended that part of the journey with a Zaurus.  I decided that the form factor wasn't good enough for me to get productive work done and they were really just toys, so I struggled by with laptop and desktop, I got an MSI Wind and really enjoyed it, proper portable computing, then when apple finally launched their much anticipated tablet, I jumped and I love it.  Now, since I had fallen out with pocket size computers, I never got a smartphone since I would have considered it a toy, I just have a standard nokia that can make calls and send and receive SMS.  My tablet is now a device that gives me great productivity.  i'm a bit of a photo buff and have by slr handy, or a little point and shoot nearby, don't care about having one device that does everything, right tool for the job is my mindset.  My iPad is used for consumption and for creation, I'm a BA and that involves lots of meetings and workshops, having all project documentation at my fingertips in that situation is perfect, I make big use of mind maps and the software I have for that integrates with the desktop software for continuing the work later on.  So yes, I do really need a tablet, it's perfect for me, I waited years and it has delivered proper portable computing that I've long dreamed about.  I think that if you have a smartphone, you're perhaps duplicating a lot of the functionality of your powerful little phone on the tablet device, but don't forget the screen size, the thing that turned me off the palm type devices in the first place, that is the winner for me.  I don't need it to fit in my pocket.  That's my journey and it's a bit different to the author's, so arrives at a different place.  The author made it clear at the beginning of his piece that one size does not fit all, the tablet is not something he's willing to get on board with and that's absolutely fine, but he does appear to be drawing the conclusion that no-one needs these devices and it's somehow that we've all been seduced by slick advertising selling us a device that we have no use for.  I suggest that the author gives it a whirl, he might be pleasantly surprised.",1313958434

Hurd was seen as aligning with Oracle and making decisions that did not conflict  with Oracle. EDS, conveniently missed Sun acquisition, consumer focus in lieu of enterprise paints a consistent picture. There is a reason Hurd now works at Oracle and Larry did not like him getting fired. Besides show me what he did apart from cost cutting.<p>Apotheker comes from Oracle's competitor SAP. To that effect he isn't shy of focusing on interests that happen to conflict with Oracle's. To that end, what Gruber is saying is right - the board always wanted more Enterprise focus and that required going against Oracle. That's what Apotheker is doing.<p>As for missed opportunities - it does not matter. HP just does not have the DNA to do great in the already saturated PC and phone/tablets market. Not having to deal with that means they can focus their resources and capital where they are well oiled to do great. It only mattered if HP managed to get a CEO that can change its DNA - Neither Hurd nor Apotheker were into that. If they could have found a great consumer focused CEO with proven and relevant record, then it would have been worthwhile to risk competing in consumer space when it meant losing focus on Enterprise. Otherwise its just not really smart.<p>And they are still not giving up on webOS. But the only catches here are they don't yet know what to do with webOS and the Oracle/Itanium problem. With PSG off their bottom line they could now afford to ignore webOS until they find the right thing for it and focus their hardware resources to sell more proliants and fix the Itanium problem.

Some of the targets of his critique (like the lack of sum types in Java) are also reasons why Java does not have cool embedded domain specific languages like Haskell has.",1313957870

I wouldn't even call most of that science fiction.<p>For more recent works, you might like:<p><pre><code>  Vernor Vinge\n    ""Rainbow's End""  -- more near term and what you describe\n    ""A Fire Upon the Deep"" & ""A Deepness in the Sky""\n\n  David Brin\n    ""Earth""  -- again, more near term, although with a fantastic ending\n    The Uplift Trilogy (a bit more fantastic, but very well done, particularly the 2nd and 3rd novels)\n</code></pre>\nThere are many ""classic"" authors and novels.  One novel that receives somewhat less attention/accolades, but which I think speaks to some of what you ask, is:<p><pre><code>  Arthur C. Clarke\n    ""The City and the Stars""\n</code></pre>\nNeal Stephenson' <i>The Diamond Age</i> might also resonate.  And while both more ""near term"" and historical, his <i>Cryptonomicon</i> has some very worthy reflections and speculations.<p>And I guess I really can't pass up suggesting Carl Sagan's <i>Contact</i>.  Superb.<p>As for films, I'm not the most versed, but the following, more ""real"" science fiction films come to mind:<p><pre><code>  GATTACA\n  Blade Runner (yeah, yeah, but I just re-watched it)\n  And I'll mention that Star Trek (particularly, for me, The Next Generation), is now on or coming to Netflix\n</code></pre>\nP.S.  And of course, William Gibson's <i>Neuromancer</i> and, was it the next one or the next two novels?  His short story collection, ""Burning Chrome"", fits well into these two or three.<p>And as for a certain pragmatic perspective on human psychology, behavior, and possible near term societal/political developments, the classic Heinlein ouvre, while perhaps sexist or interpretable as such, and also in other ways somewhat ""archaic"", is nonetheless insightful.<p>Probably not what you're looking for, but now that I've rambled on, there it is.<p>P.P.S.  I found Asimov's original ""Robot"" trilogy a very insightful allegory for the competing demands of public knowledge and privacy in the modern world.

About half of my former high school classmates now live in a different country and are fluent in the language of that country, whether it's English, German, Spanish, or Italian. Most of the Americans I've met know only English, some bits of French/Spanish, and some bits of Latin.<p>I'm not saying that learning Latin is completely useless -- I am simply saying that I believe that whatever advantage it gives is insignificant compared to actually going to the country and speaking the language. As a matter of fact, I believe that teaching Latin/Greek in American schools is a giant conspiracy designed to making pupils appear educated without actually giving them practical knowledge.<p>Which is completely different from the situation with programming -- where, if you are really, really good with math and logic, you can pick up pretty much any programming language relatively easily.",1313957582

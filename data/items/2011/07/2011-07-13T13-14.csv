I don't like that either.<p>I'd rather raise a healthy, curious, creative, passionate, and happy child.<p>I couldn't care less about what he achieves.<p>If he achieves nothing, so be it. In fact, on average, he won't achieve much ... but when he does achieve something, it'll blow your mind.<p>And that little drone you raised, who is desperately trying to catch your attention? He'll focus on titles and milestones. He can verbalize that. He can quantify it. He can get others (and you) to easily recognize his ""achievement"" ... more to the point, he will always be trying to put you in a position where you MUST give him praise, because you constantly hold it back.<p>You want to know what that looks like? BA, BS, MS, Phd, JD, 100K salary, BMW, etc. etc. ... easily quantifiable status symbols that can be placed in a study and can be easily used to force the parent to render praise.

I've come to the conclusion that I need to learn to program.  (Know it's debatable whether bix/mkting folks should waste their time learning, but I want to learn anyway.)<p>I have a pet project that Id like to build, but could use your help determining which language is best for me to start with and what online resources I should prioritize.  Should note that Ive done some homework here:  I took MITs Intro to Computer Programming (Python) class via Udemy and I completed the Rails for Zombies tutorial.But, while I can go through those exercises OK enough, Im stuck when it comes to putting it all together and building something useful  thats where I could use your help.<p>I want to be able to build a form with multiple data entry types that automatically emails certain groups of people based on data submitted.  Simple, yeah? (I hope.)<p>Any recommendations on where to start with this project?  Know Railscasts has a series of episodes all about forms  but is that better for this project than Python or some other language/set of resources?<p>Thanks in advance for your help  know the how do I learn to program question gets asked quite a bit around here

Unless you're parenting in an unique way, parents usually are seen as an authority figure by the kids. Because of this, over-encouragement could be seen as forcefulness, and act to discourage the child by creating a sense of obligation. This is exactly what happened to me on multiple occasions. I swam breast stroke competitively when I was younger, and stopped training completely when my coach and my parents decided I should train for higher level competition. I also played badminton on a provincial level, and basically the same thing happened. This isn't me being lazy. I trained 9 hours a day last summer at the Shaolin temple on my own will.<p>On the other end, everything I've built (or done, other sports included), I've done so on my own accord, either with no support from my parents, or just a slight tinge of interest. I guess every child is different - just make sure not to make them feel obligated.",1310565354

I'm guessing that you mean ""open"" in the sense that it can run more Windows applications, provides more access to the OS, and is generally a more ""full blown"" operating system of the type that we (geeks) are used to.<p>I get what you're saying. I really do. But we should talk. In order to understand the broader market (outside of geeks buying gadgets for themselves), you have to see past your own interests. There are plenty of people for whom hacking on their computer is a pastime. This can mean any number of things like building your own computer or building your own software. The key is, hacking on the computer is an end, not a means. In the broad market, the computer is a means, not an end. Full stop.<p>Most business users want to accomplish a goal. In the business space, it's about accessing, sharing, and manipulating business data. The reason everyone (outside of geeks) <i>says</i> they want a full blown OS on a computer is because they want access to the tools they're used to using for accomplishing these tasks (hello, Excel). As Henry Ford said, ""If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."" In essence, Microsoft is breeding faster horses while everyone else is designing cars.<p>I'm not sure what it means to be an ""open platform advocate"", but when I hear that term, I think open source software, and to use Windows in that same sentence really blows my mind. That's why I'm left to assume that you're talking about open in the other sense (open access to the system). For my part, I'm an advocate of open platforms in this sense, but I have a sense of scope. I realize that the tablet market for business managers doesn't overlap entirely with the tablet market for hackers.<p>I think that as the computing market continues to mature, devices for hackers will become a niche. This is a natural consequence of the fact that hackers are a small group. We are not in the majority. Be thankful for that, because the demand for hackers is high and the supply is limited.",1310564250

Keep a couple of things in mind:<p>* If you have a valid lease, there should be no conflicting IP addresses on the network<p>* Even if you do have a conflicting IP address, that conflict only exists until the DHCP server issues you a new one (iOS immediately performs the DHCP request after sniffing)<p>IP conflicts are not voodoo magic. Once the conflicting machine gets a new IP address, everything returns to normal. The network events shown in the article show that this occurs in about 1s; between the time that the interface comes up, 0.3s, and the time the interface is active, 1.3s. If this were a full negotiation, it would take around 5s.<p>The key thing to remember is that this shouldn't happen at all on healthy networks. So, if anyone chooses to remain opposed to this, they're saying that waiting 10s every time you wake a portable device from sleep and want to use the network connection is a worthwhile tradeoff to accommodate DHCP servers that don't respect leases and switches that can't adequately resolve an ARP entry conflict in a timely manner.<p>I've said it about ten times in this discussion already, but I'll keep the ten seconds (times 15-20 sleep/wake events per day) and buy decent network equipment.",1310563287

If I had it to do over again I'd just do the $80 package, because if you've got a great product and some traction, you'll get coverage no matter what PR package you choose. Basically, just host your PR yourself and use a service to do a half-hearted sharing with the world.<p>The more expensive package may have gotten my PR re-hosted in a couple places (in the San Jose Mercury News, for one), but no, it didn't make the launch any more successful or make TechCrunch bang down my door.",1310562748

The laws are the way they are.<p>The laws are the way they&#x27;re written, and the way they&#x27;re read, and open to discussion and revision on both sides. If you&#x27;re upset or threatened by that (and I can&#x27;t see any other reason for some of the gratuitous hostility in your comment), perhaps your position isn&#x27;t anywhere near as strong as you might like your bluster to communicate, and perhaps it would be better to find some less distressing activity with which to pass time than discuss it on the internet.<p>> the police can detain you if they have reasonable suspicion to believe you are involved in a crime in any way<p>This isn&#x27;t the point of contention at all.

Stock-options in startups, for example, are little more than pretend, considering the actual chances you&#x27;ll see any money from them.<p>In the end, to be honest, I&#x27;d rather have pretend-decision-sharing than pretend-ownership, i.e. businesses that are egalitarian on paper but not in reality.

The challenge of trying to do base64 decoding fast there is that you generally have to ignore whitespace characters (and possibly other junk as well).<p>The code implementation here clearly requires that all the extraneous stuff get kicked out and the resulting string be compacted, an operation whose overhead by itself could easily negate merely a 46% gain; it&#x27;s hard to see how it could be modified to make the stateful decisions while still keeping the tight gain. I also have a sneaking suspicion that the improved scalar version might turn out to be worse in real-world systems because the 4KiB table would cause L1 cache thrashing if you&#x27;re doing lots of small base64 decodings followed by later processing (e.g., string conversion).<p>So the real problem is that the measurement is done in a way which is different enough from real-world scenarios that it&#x27;s questionable if any speedup is actually achievable in those scenarios, let alone one as significant as a 46% gain.

In fact, with a lot of the &quot;browser&quot; side stuff, like bookmarks, extensions, etc. gone there is performance gains to be had using node-webkit/Electron, etc. in my experience using them. It also allows you to get around some security contexts that running untrusted code in a browser environment requires.",1453702493
10965860,comment,10964266,10965718,0,0,sandworm101,,,"Being a fighter pilot in the US is strange.  In most countries it is seen as a long-term commitment, a career.  But since TopGun, US fighter jocks just don&#x27;t stay that long.  Five years or so, then retirement into civilian life.  Being a fighter pilot seems more of a career stepping stone.  (Same goes for seals.)  I keep running into ex pilots at security events, at committee meetings, or as politicians.  So I can understand the demand.  Your brother was up against not just those wanting to be pilots, but also those wanting the badge on the resume.<p>The flip side is that while well trained, US pilots have a bit of a reputation.  They seem like they are trying to fit the TopGun stereotype.  I once read somewhere that the Naval program on which the movie is based was losing more pilots to motorcycle accidents than flying.  That&#x27;s probably an aberration as these are small numbers, but the concept that pilots would even ride motorcycles off duty is odd.  You&#x27;d never see an astronaut taking such risks.",1453702429

The problem is that the consumer wants the hits, the names, the current hot artists. They don&#x27;t want the long tail of unknown artists.<p>Sure there are those who like to check out the new stuff and occasionally something pops.<p>Soundcloud will eventually end up paying the same royalty rates as Spotify, Pandora, Rhapsody, Slacker, and all the rest thus eliminating this &quot;SoundCloud has much better unit economics than Spotify.&quot;<p>What is to stop Spotify from adding an artist upload feature?<p>The macroeconomic factors on why all of the music delivery services are eventually going to fall in value has to do with Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon treating music as a valueless commodity.<p>No one can charge more than iTunes for a song or streaming service. Apple sets the market price and operates their business at low margins due to ancillary revenue from hardware. If you&#x27;re a music service and have no ancillary revenue to increase overall margins, you&#x27;ve got a classic business problem. The comparison to Youtube is also flawed because it doesn&#x27;t mention that AdSense is the ancillary revenue that has kept YouTube afloat these many years.<p>Furthermore, the content owners (copyright holders) will continue to raise prices and cut exclusive deals with different providers in order to maintain their cut of the pie. You see this with the content patchwork across Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and even Youtube Red. No player has all the licenses all the time.<p>Music is a wonderful thing, but delivery is a commodity service where the players are competing on style and features. Content is ephemeral and a marketing illusion for the most part. If you want people to come, you have to have the stars.",1453702260

For example, it tells (via moral conditioning) not to kill or maim or wound (not to mention insult as you evidently are doing here) one&#x27;s fellow humans - yet reading the daily news will confirm that such violence does happen on a regular basis (despite fear &quot;telling&quot; them not to do it).

The idea that we can take something as fantastically complex and as poorly understood as nutrition and successfully boil it down to a formula is really, really unlikely at this point.<p>2. As incredibly unlikely as it is that someone could create such a formula, even if they had access to and total understanding of all the research that currently exists in the world, it is even more far-fetched that it would be some random software developers who would create it.<p>3. Even if, despite all that, Soylent is the perfect formula, it still isn&#x27;t. As is becoming more evident, diet is so individualized that the idea that one formula would be ideal for any significant percentage of the population is very unlikely.<p>Given all that, it seems really unlikely that Soylent should be the cornerstone of your diet.<p>So, having spent way too much time studying and experimenting with diet (including SAD,vegetarian, vegan, paleo-variations, etc), the only nutrition advice I feel comfortable with (assuming you are so lucky as to have the choices I do in middle-class America, with practically every food available) is just to start with a variety of whole, unprocessed foods (probably mostly plants) and do your best to identify the ones that you have obvious issues with and avoid those. As there is seemingly no known individual health benefit to gain from processed foods, the safe bet seems to be to avoid them in favor of unprocessed foods when possible. At least until the next over-hyped study comes out showing that vegetables kill!",1453701811

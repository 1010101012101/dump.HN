Or is nginx different somehow?  That's fine as far as it goes, but the tricky part lies in serving up the dynamic stuff.",1199746146
95786,comment,95722,95738,0,0,cstejerean,,,"I disagree. Often if you write your own framework you end up with small, maintainable code that you fully understand and that does exactly what you need.<p>Different reasons for writing a new framework:<p>1. sometimes you disagree with the general direction of the available frameworks. Different people can think differently (think for a second about the different TYPES of frameworks available for web development)<p>2. a lot of times you don't need 100% of someone else's framework.<p>3. sometimes it's faster to write something than to research available frameworks and read their documentation.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not against code reuse. For tedious work (like re-implementing a protocol with a nasty spec) you want to use a library that someone else has developed and tested. For doing crypto you probably want algorithms and libraries that have been well studied and tested.<p>I look at frameworks (not libraries) as examples of how to integrate various libraries and an approach to solving the particular problem. This is good. Take a look at many frameworks and get inspiration. But then feel free to write something that works for you, reusing code where necessary. That's the beauty of open source.",1199746055

You might notice his graph has 'Django caching' in it.<p>It allows about 10x more requests.<p>His route seems to add another 10x worth of performance or something.<p>As to caching pages, timeouts, it is completely possible to cache things as they are created and make use of them.  The timeout method is just the first, simplest way of caching saying (cache this one page for a minute, so when it gets YC'd, it only recalculates the page every minute)",1199744244

95770,comment,95758,95758,0,0,carpal,,,"Is this seriously the first implementation of this in Django?<p>I seriously hate gloating, but Rails' page caching has been around for two years.  I must be mistaken.<p>edit: After browsing the Django documentation, it appears that I'm right.  While you can store the output of a view in the filesystem (or memcached, or whatever), cached hits still need to go through the framework to get dispatched.  This appears to be the first way to skip the framework (aside from Squid or similar), which is what Rails' page caching does.<p>Page caching creates the cached page on the first request, and dishes out the cached output until it is swept (after a new create/update/delete). This seems like the ""no duh"" approach.  The Django ""standard"" way of setting a timed expiration seems silly and inflexible.",1199743293

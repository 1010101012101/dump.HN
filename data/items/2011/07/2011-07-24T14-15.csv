How best to live in a world where we can't get what we always want?<p>There are a lot of people with psychological problems in this world. Philosophy won't help them one bit.

2799403,comment,2796891,2797886,1,0,equalarrow,,,"I totally agree - saying NO is one of the best things you can do. And also ""I don't know"" is ok as well.<p>I've been in high level meetings with business guys before and watched them say ""yah, we can do that"", knowing we could not. While, in theory, saying yes might be a 'positive step in the right direction', what it usually means is all engineers will be working god-awful hours to get the work done. What is done is then usually sub-par because there wasn't enough time to think about the problems to be solved. Sometimes, code and great architecture come quick. But more often is slow and iterative. Having insane deadlines and workload because someone says yes is just a bad idea all around.<p>But I would even step back a bit from the computer science aspect for beginners. One thing that was very hard for me was abstraction. When I first tried learning OO programming, it was very frustrating. The problems that people modeled did not make any sense. A car has a wheel which is composed of a tire, etc... I felt like I needed real concepts. I always liked the 'User'. A user has as name, age, height, etc. It can also have multiple addresses. Once you have basic info like this, you can start doing things with or to it. Authentication is a perfect example.<p>Having a concept (a key) that you understand and can work with and model - like the User example - not only starts you on your way as a programmer, but also provides the bridge to learning other languages. And when I was younger, this is exactly what I did, I brought my 'key' (a User/Person) with me, started small, and built out from there. This was before understanding data structures, algorithms, patterns, etc.<p>So my ultimate advice (besides staying honest and being able to say no or I don't know) is have a simple 'key' concept you understand inside and out. This can open all the doors later down the road.",1311516715

We learn that maybe consciousness is more than a deterministic bunch of bio-chemical reactions taking place in our frontal lobes that can be modeled via neural networks and computer processors.

try `ack` instead<p><pre><code>    ack --css '#content'

Above command will recursively search for '#content' in all css files under the current directory. It is faster than grep and does automatically exclude your hidden version control folders. No need to mess with `--exclude`. I really stopped using grep at all.

7658267,comment,7657899,7657899,3,0,nsted,,,"No, I don&#x27;t currently own one. I bought a MakerBot Cupcake in 2010. I had fun assembling it, and was happy that my first print (a Darth Vader head) was flawless...it would be the only one. All subsequent prints suffered from lifting rafts, or air printing, or just stopping for who knows why. I fought daily with the machine for a good month before recognizing that I wanted prints, not to be a tinkerer of 3d printers. So I handed it over to my local makerspace, and started using Shapeways. The results were very satisfying, even though it was expensive.<p>Each of the last two generations of MakerBot Replicators were released with promises that they just work. While much has improved, threads on their mailing list show that some of the same frustrations that I experienced 4 years ago have persisted...specifically the air printing. I&#x27;m not going to buy another one yet.",1398661193

You&#x27;ll also need either a US citizen or a US corporate person, per their terms and conditions.<p>Non-residents can get both US corporate persons and US bank accounts, though it takes a bit of work these days.  You can form an LLC trivially online (I used LegalZoom for a Nevada LLC, on advice of my accountant).  Getting a bank account is <i>modestly</i> more difficult.  The easiest way is to go to a multinational bank which has branch offices in your country and get them to pull the strings to open up a <i>US</i> account for you on behalf of your <i>US</i> LLC, with the person having signatory authority being you.  This keeps everything nice and tidy with their Know Your Customer processes, most of the time.  Citibank is my go-to bank for arranging this for Japanese people, but in principle, you can get it from any bank willing to give it to you.  (Word to the wise: they may be suddenly radically more willing to pull the strings if you are vague about your revenue numbers.  &quot;We&#x27;re just establishing the US LLC on a trial basis with one product, but may redirect more of our business through it as time goes on.  So, I don&#x27;t know, call it $X0k per month immediately and potentially higher depending on future conditions.&quot;)<p>Note that international taxation is complicated.  Talk to an accountant.  Seriously.  Talk to an accountant!  I probably overpaid at least five figures over the years due to not taking this advice earlier.",1398661136

I used the second to print parts for the third, then (once I had the third working correctly) I rebuilt the Printrbot+ addressing some of its flaws.<p>3) It&#x27;s fun to design and make 3d printers.<p>I might sell the Printrbot but I&#x27;m not sure what kind of market there is for used hobbyist 3d printers.<p>I&#x27;ll probably build more, too.

Some people complain that it doesn&#x27;t have quite the off-the-shelf setup of pre-made modules for e.g. powerful e-commerce or super easy theming, but I think regardless it&#x27;s an example of the way a CMS/CMF should be written in the 2010s. In fact I approached a developer of one of the early CMSes that is still hanging around, and he was quite interested in migrating to PW as a content management framework backend rather than using an application framework. The CMS part of ProcessWire is built upon the ProcessWire content management API and it&#x27;s easy to build your own custom back end if you don&#x27;t like it.<p>With a content management framework (such as PW), so much has already been done for you that you start to wonder why you will ever need an application framework. Of course, application frameworks are very useful but CMFs are not to be missed out on. I just finished writing a project management system using ProcessWire and it&#x27;s been a lot of fun.

7658206,comment,7657961,7657961,6,0,eslaught,,,"I&#x27;m going to argue against the idea that functional languages are flourishing as a result of the availability of parallelism. There are two reasons for this:<p>* Performance is not that big an issue for many applications. And if performance is not an issue, then neither is parallelism: the only reason to do parallelism is for performance (as opposed to concurrency, which makes sense even on sequential processors). So parallelism only <i>really</i> matters for performance-critical applications, because in most non-performance critical applications, you can squeeze out 10x by just running a profiler and writing better serial code.<p>* If you do want performance, parallelism alone is not sufficient. On modern processors, data movement is significantly more expensive than computation. And in that regard, most functional languages perform poorly. Imperative languages, for all their faults, give you much more fine grained control over memory usage patterns. So for performance-critical applications (which are again, the only applications where you really care about parallelism), it is not uncommon to see the core of the application written in C/C++, even if the rest of the application is written in something else.<p>By the way, if you aren&#x27;t measuring your performance by comparing it against the peak compute/memory bandwidth of the machine, then you don&#x27;t really care about performance, because you don&#x27;t really have any idea what you&#x27;re leaving on the table. This is why it&#x27;s possible, for many applications, to give the code to an experienced performance programmer and see speedups in excess of 10x.",1398658948

If your functions are partitioned in a strange way, you can just as easily produce spaghetti code. Same with nested if statements. You can write well structured code in Fortran 77 for example, even though most standard control structures involve a goto. Absence of a goto statement is neither necessary nor sufficient for enforcing structured code. One real advantage is perhaps that the compiler has more invariants to work with.",1398658128

The CBLAS package should work well, and I believe all of the goblas functions that are there have good tests. In my opinion, Mat64 needs a lot of work before it is a &quot;premiere&quot; package (a bunch is missing and a bunch is slow). That said, I use it in my work and many parts of it are good. We are interested in making it better, but it&#x27;s entirely volunteer and it all takes time.

Distributed computation also benefits hugely from immutable values, as it sidesteps much of the problem with cache expiry.<p>We&#x27;re also seeing a demand for more reliable systems. Taking mutability out of the equation eliminates a significant area of possible bugs, and allows for more sophisticated type-checking.<p>The third reason is simply that it&#x27;s only recently that we&#x27;ve gotten good functional languages with a comprehensive and mature set of libraries. Haskell has been around for decades, but when I first started learning it seven or eight years ago, the set of libraries on offer was very thin compared to Haskell today.

Whenever I point out what needs to be changed, before I finish the sentence they make one of the changes (sometimes incorrectly) and then hit &quot;build and run&quot; in their IDE before I can stop them - and then often face a very long list of compilation errors, because I hadn&#x27;t finished telling them everything that needed to be changed. I&#x27;ve also observed on many occasions someone trying to fix a bug by making many, many tiny changes, seemingly randomly, and attempting to compile and run between each change to &quot;see if it works now&quot;, their code turning into a horrible mess in the process. A suitable term for this could be &quot;IDE thrashing&quot;, since it appears to come from the &quot;instant gratification&quot; that they provide. Quite unproductive, and usually a sign that whoever is doing it has only a very vague idea of how their code works.<p>When I started using IDEs, the temptation was certainly quite strong, so I can certainly understand how those who started with one could fall into this trap. I think it takes a lot of discipline and the realisation that these frequent iterations are breaking concentration and making it more difficult to focus on the problem to avoid it. Even today most of my work is done with a text editor, a whiteboard, a pencil, and lots of paper. Whenever I face a non-obvious bug, my first reaction is not to &quot;try something that might work&quot;, but to think carefully about the code/algorithm again and see if I didn&#x27;t miss something the first time I designed it, because it tends to be just an indication that there&#x27;s something further wrong.",1398657767

We didn't include Netty because it felt a little bit like comparing apples with oranges. But I wouldn't doubt if Netty showed numbers equal to (or greater?) the results we have seen for Deft. Netty, the successor to apache mina, is a really cool socket framework written by a really smart guy (Trustin Lee).""",1329721165

So why did they do it? Because it makes obvious sense on a touch device, and because there is nothing wrong with it on laptop or desktop. The annoyance lasted about 5 minutes for me.<p>As for the automatic app management, why doesn't this make sense on OS X?  Because that's how it has always been done? Again, not at all persuasive. And honestly, the OS has long been responsible for resource management, why shouldn't it terminate and launch apps transparently?<p>I think though that you and many others are missing the point about transparently terminating and restarting apps.  It is just part of being able to restore ones workspace after a restart, which is itself just part of creating a seamless pervasive personal computing environment.",1329721093

It was statistically the best option, but since they didn't convert, Belichick's been hammered for that decision ever since. If a coach on the bubble makes that call and the team doesn't convert, he's probably gone the next year.

The graphing commands have a few quirks, and a lot of non-orthogonal inputs, but it lets you dig in and do things at a pretty low level, in case you want to fine-tune your graphs.<p>One thing I remember fondly from Matlab days, that R isn't so good at, was the ability to grab a handle to a graph axis, and rescale the axis, without starting a new plot.  R pretty much forces you to know, from the start, what limits each axis should have.<p>A colleague uses SciPy and is similarly very happy.  However, I can't speak about it from personal experience.<p>I've used gnuplot (www.gnuplot.info/) for small tasks (one or two lines on an x-y plot).  My general impression is I would find it too constricting for bigger jobs.

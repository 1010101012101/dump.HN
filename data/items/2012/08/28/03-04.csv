4442057,comment,4441943,4441943,8,0,grueful,,,"No. Context is very important here, and it's actually quite apt with regard to hiring and being hired.<p>Data-driven marketing (DDM) is a huge thing now because it reliably magnifies revenue streams. However, the skill set to execute on such strategies is a bit non-traditional for marketing. If you want to hire someone to help build your DDM team, you don't necessarily want a business grad or a top salesman. What you want is an math or engineering transplant, someone with the statistical and technical skills necessary but who knows or is interested in learning the business and marketing aspects.<p>""Growth hacker"" moonlights as a buzzword, but it's actually a great way to spin a job opening to appeal to the audience you need to attract: tech-to-business transplants. Ergo, it can also be effective self-branding if you're a tech-to-business transplant looking to make $$$ for helping to create well-documented X% to XX% revenue improvements.",1346126369

Yahoo Pipes, Google Fusion Tables...<p>I think startups are, in a way, almost required to unlock the full potential of novel tech ideas. A startup can apply an awesome idea to a niche, gain traction, and expand whereas the defacto launch of a tech product at BigCo X or Y applies the tech across a broad segment of their user base. Broad launches are a good way to make your product generally available, but a bad way to ensure it truly solves some core need your customers have.",1346126355

I mean, our tax code is such that it makes far more sense to sell a company than to just take money out the usual way, even if you get the same amount of money total.   If you sell the company, you pay a much lower capital gains rate, wheras if you take profit either as a distribution or as salary, you pay much more.

The worst argument in the world (a general FORM of argument) is described this way in the submitted article:<p>""I declare the Worst Argument In The World to be this: 'X is in a category whose archetypal member has certain features. Therefore, we should judge X as if it also had those features, even though it doesn't.'""<p>This recalls many cases on Hacker News when someone has disagreed with someone else by saying, ""Your argument is an example of [name of rhetorical or logical fallacy]."" Perhaps it is carrying out the worst argument in the world to identify one part of someone's statement as a logical fallacy, if the fallacy doesn't vitiate the statement, and if sound evidence is still in view to support the statement. Sometimes facts of the world are as they are even if they are mentioned by people who argue inaptly, so it would indeed be a bad argument to ignore the message because of infelicities of expression by the messenger.

Zuckerberg misapproprited hundreds of photos of his classmates and their personal information, and then sent them provocative emails that would cause most students to check on what's been posted about them, or what's been posted about others, i.e., they would visit the site.<p>It's like the story of the YouTube guys posting some of their own videos to get things started.  Then they eventually had to upload some copyrighted content.  They took a risk.<p>Then there's the story of Bittorrent.

Alas, you need to have content on offer from day #1.  And it needs to be compelling content, in terms of quality, quantity or both.<p>Zuckerberg broke the rules.  He stole student's personal profiles from the university's network.  And he got away with it.  Luck was in his favor and he knows it.  Others who would try this now might not be so lucky.<p>Diaspora relies on people to submit their own content, but it had no compelling content to begin with.  Not only did they start with no content that would draw people in, but if I'm not mistaken they expect people to run their own web servers.  This is not impossible to imagine but why web servers?  I guess because they want to replicate Facebook.<p>Solution: Don't replicate Facebook.  Build something a little different.  Stop thinking only in terms of web servers and web clients.  Think peer-to-peer.  Think in terms of application-agnostic _connections_, not applications.  Do this and you instantly have something that is 100x more useful than Facebook.

Run it through some kind of validator? Or just wait a couple days and see if Google has picked up the file properly? The former is what you get with XML, the latter is what you get with DNS (and which necessitates tools such as DNS Report). If you dislike the complexity of the first option, you must be saying you prefer the second, which is ludicrous.<p>> Text encoding handled like any other text file.<p>So not, in other words. Or we can implicitly include HTTP in our non-specification, and now our user has to be sure the server is going to issue the file with the correct encoding header. Which again is not something our poor benighted user is going to have the chops to do.<p>> Attribute and content validity issue exists with XML, too<p>I didn't say XML magically makes these problems go away.

The operators are kind of visually ""thick"" and the prefix/postfix/infix mix obscures the logic for me.<p>Of course, this is because I only barely grok Haskell.  If I really knew Haskell I'm sure I wouldn't have an issue with the syntax, but as someone trying to learn about Monads from a category-theoretic perspective, Haskell just ends up confusing me more than the extra annotations provided by its type system can compensate.<p>I found I understood monads a little better after this article, because the Lisp syntax is uniform enough that it disappeared into the background.  The lack of type annotation brings some fresh confusion right back in, but that's the cost of using Clojure for this example.<p>Again, all of this is just how my own brain works.  Your brain may vary :)<p>An interesting approach would be to try teaching monads with typed Racket.

4441928,comment,4439840,4441478,3,0,rosser,,,"My biggest disappointment with their execution is that they made pretty much zero apparent effort to coordinate with any of the other federated social networking projects, of which there are many. Had they done that, and from early on  or at least built things in a way to make that easy, and proactively worked with projects as they appeared  everyone could have leveraged the network effects of all those networks, and they probably wouldn't be handing their rewrite off to the public while they move on to bigger and better today.<p>Yes, they support OmniAuth and Salmon, but integrating with another platform is <i>someone else's</i> responsibility. Maybe I'm wrong (I actually hope I am), but that feels to me more like wanting Diaspora, itself, to succeed, and not federated social networking in general. To an extent, that's to be expected; we all want to succeed at what we're doing. But particularly in something like federated social networking, the rising tide of interoperability lifts all boats much more quickly than everyone else having to dredge channels into your little estuary. Yes, that isn't quite a walled garden, but it's a lot closer than the rhetoric they slung to sell the project would suggest.<p>I'm also a little concerned for how much their lack of success might have hindered other software projects from being successful at funding themselves via sites like Kickstarter, but that's much better addressed in the other comments in this thread, so I'll leave it at that.<p>Those aren't my only complaints, but, again, they've all been addressed, and far better than I have time for or interest in rehashing, else-thread.<p>Yes, my tone was harsh. But Diaspora left a very bad taste in my, and many others' mouths. However unkind my tone may have been, I genuinely don't think some degree of derision is unwarranted. Net, I honestly think the project did more damage to the cause of federated social networking than it did good. Sure, they put the idea that it was possible in a lot of peoples' heads. And then they demonstrated that it probably can't be done, because if a bunch of whiz-kids (whom the public can't distinguish from Zuck, except that Zuck was successful) with hundreds of thousands of dollars behind them can't pull it off, then who can?<p>The thing is, I don't agree with your characterization of their competence. Yes, they're probably all very smart people, and I'm sure they've learned a great deal over the past couple years. Being smart is not the same as being competent, however. They were utterly unprepared for what they asked the world to pay them to do. I'm generally in favor of diving in headfirst and trying to learn to swim, but not on someone else's  let alone thousands of <i>unsophisticated</i> (at least in terms of investing in technology projects) people's dime. That's not competence, in my book. It's irresponsibility.<p>EDIT: For the record, I agree with you that my comment is characteristic of a growing negativity on HN. I'm actually genuinely saddened that it's the highest-rated thing I've ever said here. It was intended to be a glib, throw-away comment, and was admittedly laden with snark. I stand by my position, though, however much my delivery might have warranted some softening.",1346123239

This place sucks, and I can get a job anywhere I want!""  Then they do.<p>So you're left with the middle - people who do their job reasonably well and aren't dumb enough to take risks that might get them downgraded.  Projects that are in trouble can't be turned around because the best (remaining) people stay away.  And the people who couldn't get away find other jobs.

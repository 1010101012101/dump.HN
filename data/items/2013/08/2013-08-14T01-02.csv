This would be a dispassionate reporting of people&#x27;s behavior as well.<p>You may ask &quot;How do you pick the experts?&quot; Well, how did we pick the people whose diction the dictionary supposedly represents? :) We make do with approximations. I think that the OED could easily afford to sample 1000 English teachers ranging from professors to grade school, and ranging across many geographical regions and social strata. It would actually be fascinating data to see alongside a definition!<p>Edit: I had meant to add that the sampling for the words need not happen for every (word, expert) combination; giving each instructor 1000 words chosen uniformly from a pool of 10,000 words should get you reasonable coverage for almost all of those 10,000 words.

Raising money is attractive, not just for the money, but for the validation it brings. One of the hardest parts of doing a startup is talking with non-founders about what you do .. it&#x27;s so easy to say &quot;I work at Google&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m in med school&quot;. The closest equivalent, for founders, is being able to say &quot;our investors .. &quot;.<p>I remember PG mentioned this .. that one reason Y-Combinator was so successful is it gives high-acheivers &quot;a program&quot; to talk about, almost a vetted excuse for why founders who could be otherwise working at Google or Goldman, or studying at Stanford are instead living in a cramped apartment and subsisting on ramen.<p>But I think it&#x27;s ok to get seduced by money and prestige for the 1st time. You learn, you move on and up and get better at this stuff. Mainly you learn that the most important skill of being a founder is separating yourself from how non-founders think. Then you no longer focus on external validation and start thinking about building a real company.",1376445184

2010 Progress Report Submitted to the National
Science Foundation (NSF) October 2010
Alan Kay et al<p>&quot;If computing is importantfor daily life, learning, business,
national defense, jobs, and more  then qualitatively advancing
computing is extremely important. For example, many software
systems today are made from millions to hundreds of millions of
lines of program code that is too large, complex and fragile to be
improved, fixed, or integrated. (One hundred million lines of code at 50
lines per page is 5000 books of 400 pages each! This is beyond human
scale.) What if this could be made literally 1000 times smaller  or more?
And made more powerful, clear, simple, and robust? This would bring one
of the most important technologies of our time from a state that is
almost out of human reachand dangerously close to being out of
controlback into human scale.<p>(...)<p>Previous STEPS Results<p>The first three years were devoted to making much smaller, simpler, and
more readable versions of many of the prime parts of personal computing,
including: graphics and sound, viewing/windowing, UIs, text,
composition, cells, TCP/IP, etc. These have turned out well (they are
chronicled in previous NSF reports and in our papers and memos).  For
example, essentially all of standard personal computing graphics can be
created from scratch in the Nile language in a little more than 300
lines of code. Nile itself can be made in a little over 100 lines of
code in the OMeta metalanguage, and optimized to run acceptably in
realtime (also in OMeta) in another 700 lines. OMeta can be made in
itself and optimized in about 100 lines of code.&quot;<p>More:<p><a href=""http://www.vpri.org/html/writings.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vpri.org/html/writings.php</a>",1376442695

Now it seems more enterprisey with all of the major links on the frontpage linking to the solutions page which have way too much content for someone who isn&#x27;t attached to the product yet. It seems almost more geared towards the business folks rather than the devops people like before. What I like about Ansible is that it gets you up running fast.

  geturl;
  add urls to listofurls; }<p>Doing it on a large scale over and over is a harder problem (which common crawl does for you) but its not too difficult until you hit scale or want realtime crawling.<p>Building an index on 210 TB of data however... Assuming you use Sphinx/Solr/Gigablast you are going to need about 50 machines to deal with this amount of data with any sort of redundancy. That&#x27;s just to hold a basic index which is not including &quot;pagerank&quot; or anything (Gigablast is a web engine so it might have that in there not sure). You aren&#x27;t factoring in adding rankers to make it a webs search engine, spam/porn detection and all of the other stuff that goes with it. Then you get into serving results.

Don&#x27;t build roads because criminals and terrorists will drive on them. There will be also UPS/FedEx couriers delivering printed child pornography driving those roads. So better, setup checkpoint and unmanned vehicle x-ray type scanners and set them up every where on highways.<p>More insane: don&#x27;t open a barber shop, because if you have hairy guy robbing bank next door, he can get a haircut at your place and cops will have hard time recognizing him.<p>I don&#x27;t think every one and each of Lavabit 1,500 paid customers were terrorist. I understand and respect people willingness to have a safe and secure email, as Constitution says you should feel save and secure in your own skin.<p>> So if you start this service you know you&#x27;re going to have to comply with government requests for that data.<p>We don&#x27;t know what really happened. Knowing how feds work just a little bit, I wouldn&#x27;t be suprised if owners were intimidated via FBI/CIA/DEA/IRS and plenty other Government Organisations. I wouldn&#x27;t be suprised if owners, their families and their friends would fall under heavy scrutiny and deep IRS audits. There is really soo many things Feds can do not to break the law, technically, and still harass $hit out of you and your family.<p>If they fall on each gov request, next we will have that barber share his info, just because feds want to. You know, terrorists are humans; they do get haircut sometimes too.",1376442031

ICC does the most rearranging (which in most cases other than this leads to faster code), and GCC generally does what you say.  
But both do things like turning my reloads from memory (to reduce port pressure) into register copies.  I was wondering if there were flags I'm not finding to prevent this.<p><i>If you're really at the spot where you have real, debugged code that is better than compiler output, the compiler is providing no value and you might as well use the assembly you've written.</i><p>Likely the best plan, but this is being used in an open source library where the rest of the work is done with intrinsics.

(Or, for that matter, in offices having no sound insulation, which can be as bad if not worse.)<p>Consistently, I've found that the people who like such environments tend to be the ones creating superficial solutions full of errors and short-sightedness.<p>Group dynamics subsequently spread the fallout from such shortcomings.  (I've come to think of corporations principally as a mechanism for risk dilution, in this respect.)  But, for those who find this insufficient, the process is exhausting.<p>It goes further than that, for me.  I simply <i>can't think</i> in the midst of the noise.<p>Being able to work wherever, from wherever, is also attractive.  But wasting my time and energy on what I find to be counter-productive noise -- that's the worst.<p>I'm actually rather good at collaboration, including face-to-face.  I refuse to sit next to someone and work to ignore them, for hours on end, when there is no point to it other than achieving a ""best practices"" (read, square footage and most superficial measurement of cost reducing) workplace.<p>So, I have this ""attitude"".  (I don't express it as such; instead, I politely request and explain my preference.)  Yet I've repeated ended up being the person with an extensive network throughout very large organizations.  I help other people out, and some of them remember this and return the favor.  (I inevitably end up finding a community of like minded individuals.)  Real collaboration, as opposed to simple co-location.<p>P.S.  Sigh.  Sorry if I got a bit ranty, here.  But this topic really pushes my buttons.  In the ""corporate"" environment, I'd be repeatedly lauded -- highly -- for my work.  But when I broached this topic -- a polite request for a quieter workspace -- it was, officially at least, a non-starter.  Certain managers did what they could, unofficially.  Others were simply critical.<p>Too many people want ""high performers"" -- and lament their dearth -- but they refuse to listen to those people's real requirements.<p>And I've too often seen arbitrary edicts substituted for real, attentive, you-have-to-work-at-it-and-<i>earn</i>-that-big-salary management.<p>I can understand the ""other side"".

Even with my prior Ember-knowledge (before Router and {{outlet}} existed in their current form) I completely failed to make sense of a recent tutorial[1].<p>I wanted to wire the tutorial up with ember-data and add pagination (nothing too fancy), but a series of undecipherable exceptions stopped me in my tracks before I got either working.<p>A major problem for me was how everything in the ""new"" Ember is tightly coupled. No longer can I just make an ArrayController, reference it in my template and populate it with standard javascript until I'm ready to drink more of the kool-aid. Or perhaps I <i>can</i>, but it seems to be an anti-pattern now. None of the (few) newer tutorials does anything like that.<p>It seems I'm now supposed to jump in head-first. I'm supposed to understand all of Ember before using Ember.<p>Sadly that didn't work out for me, even despite knowing a bit of Ember already. I was constantly stopped by opaque exceptions from the ""runloop"" which didn't even point to a line of <i>my</i> code. Tracking those down is a Royal Pain In The Ass.<p>At one point I had enough and just wanted to drop back to ""old-style"" Ember (who needs a Router anyway!) but quickly gave up on that, too, when it didn't work right away and I realized I'd be completely on my own in that style anyway.<p>So, from my short (but <i>second</i>) endeavor with Ember I have to conclude that you seem to have turned the learning curve into a perfect square-wave. Every time I made a mistake (even as much as a typo) the useless error messages threw me back a mile. It took only a few of these cycles before I gave up in frustration.<p>I think you're on a dangerous track here. When I compare my first contact with Ember (about a year ago) with my recent experience then it feels like you're about to re-invent Sproutcore. If my memory serves me right Sproutcore was pretty awesome and powerful, but so opaque and unapproachable that nobody ended up using it.<p>I really hope this doesn't happen to Ember. I hope you're going to modularize it so newbies stand a chance to <i>start small</i> instead of being bombarded with meaningless exceptions from all directions at once. I hope you'll add narrative guides with little ""run"" buttons to augment the Reference Documentation that you accidentally filed under ""Guides"".<p>I hope you'll try to be more jQuery and less Dojo. More Sinatra, less Rails. More library, less framework.<p>In short, I hope my next attempt at Ember will be more like the first and less like my last weekend.<p>[1] <a href=""http://twbrandt.github.io/2013/02/11/Ember-Quick_Start_Guide/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twbrandt.github.io/2013/02/11/Ember-Quick_Start_Guide...</a>",1365391015

5509776,comment,5509455,5509455,36,0,tokenadult,,,"I have an American friend (we met when we were both living overseas) who has been all over the world because he works for the international travel industry. He hasn't lived in the United States for at least a decade. If I remember correctly, he hasn't even visited the United States for at least four years. He and I have both long been skeptics about the United States Department of State and especially the Foreign Service. But after the Wikileaks release of many United States diplomatic cables, he told me that his respect for the United States Foreign Service had increased enormously. The members of the Foreign Service are actually quite astute about what a clash in values is involved in maintaining peaceful, normal diplomatic relations between their free, democratic country and many other countries around the world. Diplomatic business has to go on day by day even while countries are painfully slow in their evolution to civil liberties and representative governments.",1365390184

I've got some entrepreneurial spirit in me, but I also am fairly content being a cog in a larger wheel. I like steady income and insurance, and a full time corporate gig gives me that padding. If one of my nights-and-weekend side projects every picks up, sure, I'll run with it, but that's not now. It's also nice having someone willing to pay for me to go to conferences, and having other people answer the phone with things break.",1365390058

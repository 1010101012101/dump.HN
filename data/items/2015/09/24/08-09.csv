For the record, I was mostly playing devil&#x27;s advocate, but I don&#x27;t think the question is as ridiculous as the post I replied to seemed to think it is.<p>There is One True Web, of course, which is the collection of all documents on the web at any given point in time. But the interface to that web is nearly always a search engine which are all obviously presenting a list of suggestions according to some criteria. Google used to use PageRank, which was a relatively &quot;objective&quot; criteria in that at least it applied equally to all pages. Google now uses tons of data to make decisions about what to show me when I search, but neither you nor I have any idea what they are. Maybe they do actually use some algorithm which applies equally to all pages. Maybe they use some deep neural net, and not even they know how it actually works. Maybe they have a list of heuristics that they&#x27;re evilly using to manipulate all the world&#x27;s information. We&#x27;ll never know without seeing the source code.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not tabling it as a serious proposal, or claiming that Google are doing anything evil. But given that they have the potential to essentially manipulate the sum total of the world&#x27;s knowledge as seen by 99.999% of the population it doesn&#x27;t seem ridiculous to consider whether we might like more insight into what they&#x27;re doing.",1443085107

I&#x27;m not just talking about classic Dutch painters and alike. The modernists in fact had it sorted out, and commenced the shift from technique to expression.

10270449,comment,10265013,10268741,0,0,pron,,,"> Well, the problem in Haskell is that it&#x27;s a language of evaluating expressions at heart: executing effects makes no sense any more than it would in arithmetic.<p>You know what else doesn&#x27;t make sense in arithmetic? Computation. I think it is important to wonder how come mathematical definitions of computation didn&#x27;t come about until the 20th century[1] even though math has had most of its big breakthroughs (to date) by then (or, at least, there was no revolution in mathematics in the 20th century on the same scale as there was in physics). And yet, as advanced as math was, computation was only defined very late in the game. The reason is that, perhaps ironically, the concept of computation is absent from most of math, which is &quot;equational&quot;.<p>But computation is the very core of computer science. So, for example, in arithmetic, 4 and 2+2 are the same thing <i>because </i> 4 = 2 + 2. So in arithmetic, equality means &quot;sameness&quot;. But in computer science they are most certainly <i>not</i> the same, because the process of moving from one of the representation to the other is precisely what a computation does. Not only that, the process isn&#x27;t even necessarily symmetrical, as moving in one direction may entail a much higher computational complexity than going in the other direction.<p>Any distinction between calculations and effect (other than actual IO) is, therefore, arbitrary. Whether or not the particular distinctions Haskell makes (where waiting for one second may or may not be an effect depending on how it is implemented) in the form Haskell makes it -- using pure functions and equational reasoning and describing effects with monads -- is actually useful and beneficial is a question for psychologists. Given Haskell&#x27;s design, monads are certainly useful <i>in Haskell</i>, but that utility can&#x27;t be generalized to languages with other designs.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory</a>",1443082660

It also has a bunch of other articles on strands of feminism that were deeply influenced by Marx. It is the mark of an important thinker that he shows up all over the place in all sorts of topics.<p>Whatever you think Marxism is about, I&#x27;m pretty sure you can learn about it on SEP. But you can&#x27;t do that by reading a single article, any more than you can learn a major web framework by reading a single file.<p>But I do admit that SEP would benefit from more hyperlinks to make related articles more discoverable.",1443082142

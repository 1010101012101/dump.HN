Imagine a ~60% or so reduction in co2 emissions world wide. Sure 20% of people still need their big trucks, but at least not everyone. Not to mention shaving 1000 pounds off the weight of the car not only gives fuel gains, but lowers power requirements to move that vehicle. Now I was going to say... take that, combine it with tesla's engine, and now you have potentially a long-range vehicle, a vehicle that can already do 300 miles on a charge and potentially a gas engine that can charge it up so you get a nice and unlimited mileage as long as you refuel.<p>Not to mention cheaper cars!!!!!",1302324998

2426542,comment,2424070,2424070,1,0,k4st,,,"I implemented a rather nice C++ pattern matching facility for productions of context-free grammars in my undergraduate thesis project (<a href=""http://www.grailplus.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grailplus.org</a>). It is able to do some really fancy stuff and I think that is one were using C++ then one could use some similar techniques for creating list comprehensions. Here's how I envision it working:<p>First, the variables used in the comprehension would be defined locally, with the right types.<p>Second, we would need an overloaded template function, named something like ""constructor"" to abstractly represent a constructor for some arbitrary object. Here is how the constructor function works: for N arguments, all taken by reference, it allocates an array of N void * pointers (or sufficiently large slot sizes + proper alignment to hold any pointer type), and returns a pointer to the first slot in that array as some member in an instantiated template, where one of the parameters of the template contains all the info of the types of the constructor parameters. It also initializes each slot of the array to be the address of the local variable passed in to the constructor function by reference. So, if the following is my setup:<p><pre><code>   int foo;\n   float bar;\n   constructor<std::pair>(foo, bar)\n</code></pre>\nreturns an object of type Constructor<std::pair, Slot<Base<int>,float> >, where the object contains a pointer to the first slot in the array. This type and the array contain all the info we need to construct an std::pair<int,float>.<p>The comprehensions would likely require an new iteration mechanism. This was the case in my thesis project, as a cursor-based iterator, while being able to represent the iteration aspect of this, is unable to fully represent the pattern-matching/destructuring bind operations. The tricky part is to make it so that one can advance multiple loops in sequence.<p>When we know that we can enter the body of the inner loop that would normally represent the innermost loop in an imperative implementation of the same operation being performed by the comprehension then we can use the pointer table to bind values to local variables, and then use a compile-time created function from the Constructor type to yank out those values all at once, impose the proper types using a cast on the void * pointers, and then construct the thing we want to add into our final list.",1302324817

Do you not agree with me in this opinion?<p>SIMPLICIO: You are unquestionably right.<p>SALVIATI: But if this be true, and if a large stone move with a speed of, say, eight [units] while a smaller move with a speed of four, then when they are united, the system will move with a speed less than eight; but the two stones when tied together make a stone larger than that which before moved with a speed of eight.  Hence the heavier body moves with less speed than the lighter; an effect which is contrary to your supposition.

That is the issue here, and the general issue of charging money for software is not relevant. If you are linking and quoting from gnu, you are surely aware that free software is about the user of the software being able to access the source code, modify it, and redistribute it. None of these freedoms (which are also part of the open source definition) are currently given to purchasers of Honeycomb tablets. Your attempt to conflate the issue of access to source code by users with that of a distributor charging a price for software is either disingenuous or the result of a misunderstanding.",1302323099

I had been frantically trying to polish it up and was suprised by the fact that I was still able to resubmit even after the deadline (at this time the page didn't state that it would be counted as a late submission). The late submission page came up about two and a half hours after the time of the deadline and after I had done about 10 resubmissions. lol!",1302323084

The oil-and-water metaphor for those roles I have is particularly apt, in that it doesn't particularly take effort for me to keep them separate because they actively avoid mixing naturally on their own, but I can't use(/refuse to use) a system like Facebook that insists on mixing them anyhow. The ability of the Internet to facilitate this is an important aspect it has and I don't want to see us give it up.",1302322975

We have tinkered with it dozens of times. The web was originally invented for exactly this purpose. Far older things, like TeX, were invented for this purpose. Nowadays we have everything from PLoS to arXiv to Google Scholar to custom in-house blogs to PDFs sent through email.<p>The continued existence of for-profit journals is an economic, political, and anthropological problem, not a technological one. PLoS and the like are slowly changing things, but I still suspect that the only way to free our journals within less than a generation or two is to lobby (e.g.) the NIH to require that their funded projects be published in free journals. When a grant agency talks, people listen. When postdocs talk, alas, it makes a very subtle sound. ;)",1302322624

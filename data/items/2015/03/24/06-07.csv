We&#x27;re certainly open to volume pricing depending on your specific situation, and would love to learn about how to best serve/price your specific use case. sales@stripe.com is the best contact there. bkrausz@stripe.com also works :).<p>More generally, international KYC and compliant payments are quite hard, and our pricing there is very competitive. Domestically we saw that many companies were already paying similar rates on our fixed-fee pricing, so we weren&#x27;t actually hurting customers in the US (on the contrary, we were encouraging more frequent payouts for the same rate, which would help everyone by making a more efficient system). We felt that the benefits of consistent pricing were worth it here.<p>Re standalone vs. managed accounts: our preference is that we make standalone accounts such a great and easy-to-use experience that everybody starts using them, because dealing with things like information collection and tax reporting is annoying. However, we&#x27;re letting our customers dictate that. If managed accounts become immensely popular, it means we haven&#x27;t made standalone accounts easy enough to use, or we&#x27;ve made an incorrect assumption about the world (likely a combination of both). Regardless, we intend to support managed accounts for a very long time, and have already had them around in some less-built-out form for quite a while.",1427180308

9255169,comment,9243169,9254276,0,0,sytelus,,,"Sorry, I did mixed up precision in my reply. I just got time to think about this whole debate more carefully and I realize you are actually right if we fix up some of the terminology you have used. The mis-statements and confusion on my part has occurred due to this terminology differences.<p>First FP and FN are <i>not</i> probabilities. They are just unbounded numbers. This may feel pedantic but in a moment I&#x27;ll show you why this is critical. Let me draw the confusion matrix first (G = Good candidates, H = Hired candidate etc):<p>\   H	NH\n	 \---------\n       G | TP	FN\n       B | FP	TN<p>What you are referring to as probabilities is actually <i>False Positive Rate</i> or FPR and TNR respectively which is defined as follows:<p><pre><code>  FPR = FP / (FP + TN) = FP/B\n  FNR = FN / (TP + FN) = FN/G\n </code></pre>\nNow the quantity you are after is  probability that given you did hiring and ended up with good guy which is, nothing but <i>precision</i>:<p>precision = P(G|H) = TP/H<p>So how do we get TP to calculate precision if we only knew FPR, FNR, G and B? I did little equation gymnastics using above and got below:<p>TP = G - G<i>FNR\n	H = TP + FP = TP + FPR</i>B<p>So now you can plug this in to above equation for precision and find that as you increase FNR, precision goes down while you keep FPR constant. So you are actually correct. Although it might look like unnecessary exercise vs following intuition I think above equation can actually help calculate exact drop in precision and multiply that with cost of FP vs FN to get the operating sweet spot. On my part I need to do some soul searching to figure out why this didn&#x27;t triggered to me before :).",1427179319

9255150,comment,9253625,9254214,0,0,Lynbarry,,,"As far as I understand it (please someone correct me if I&#x27;m wrong):<p>1. In this case you would not have to manually accept anything, as the root certificate (the CNNIC cert) is already in your browser/os and the certificate chain for certs created by MCS would be OK (because their cert is signed by CNNIC).<p>2. As CNNIC issued them an intermediate CA cert, MCS was able to create certificates for any domain they wanted and these certificates would be considered valid by everyone that has CNNIC in the root store. So the MCS cert is not valid accross multiple domains, but it allows MCS to create certificates for every domain which kind of has the same consequences.<p>3. I think it would pose a threat when leaving the MITM network, but not as a consequence of having been in the MITM network. Only the root certificates are stored locally. Websites have to send a complete certificate chain that anchors their certs in one of the root certs. This means that the cert generated by MCS is not stored and therefore not used when leaving the network anymore. The danger is that this intermediate cert allows MCS to generate certs for any domain and use them outside their network, too.<p>4. A self signed certificate would have to be installed on the machines in the network. Otherwise users would get a certificate warning and would have to add the cert to their rootstores themselves. Other than that I think that this would grant you the same MITM-powers as this intermediate cert did for MCS, with the only restriction that you couldn&#x27;t create certs for domains not in your control that would be accepted by users outside your network/that don&#x27;d have your self signed cert installed.",1427178773

Especially with today&#x27;s giant memories, you might run testing on a 512GB machine with a billion element list, not realize there&#x27;s no TRE and it will fail on a machine with &quot;only&quot; 64GB of memory that is perfectly capable of running the same computation if TRE/TCO was done (but wasn&#x27;t).<p>I want simple-to-remember-and-use semantics, and implicitly relying on tail recursion semantics does not provide it. O() guarantees are enough (and should be properly documented) - I don&#x27;t need deterministic time or space guarantees beyond order-of-magnitude precision.<p>If you need deterministic timing in the 100ms range, most programming languages are not for you. If you need them within 10ms, most operating systems aren&#x27;t. And if you need them within 100us, most CPUs aren&#x27;t.<p>Summing up my 23 years of Python experience, noticeable pauses due to release cascades are extremely uncommon (unlike Javascript / Java pauses) - unlike Java/Javascript, with the exception of free() and a few minor loops, everything that runs is of _your_ making, which makes it easier to reason about and control.<p>And back to the subject:<p>My &quot;chain&quot; (or whatever) suggestion above, which I (and others) have made numerous times is basically a static-vs-dynamic typing assertion about how a subroutine uses the call stack at that point: &quot;need it later&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t need it later&quot;. Even for a dynamic language like Python, it makes sense to make this static because it cannot change with argument types. The incoming call stack can either be dropped at a location, or not, independent of inputs. I am surprised it is often countered (as you did here) with &quot;yes, but we can <i>test</i> it so it&#x27;s not a big deal&quot;. It&#x27;s not a big deal, but it is also comes at basically no cost, AND makes a requirement self-describing and easily verifiable by a static compiler.",1427178636

Stuff I barely use.  This works well for me, and going to a left-center-right model wouldn't gain me anything (I expect that it would cost me instead).<p>> 2) The Android app drawer is much more useful than iOS's app pages because the app drawer is arranged alphabetically, is continuous and is organized top-to-bottom.

2765021,comment,2763015,2764837,1,0,Xurinos,,,"Don't use ""git reset"" to revert committed changes.  Well... do, but be careful... The word ""revert"" is problematic here, and I suppose that ""reset"" is a bit awkward, too.<p>In git, a ""revert"" means you are creating a new commit that is the reverse of the commit you want to undo.  The two commits exist and effectively cancel each other out.  The danger here is potentially thinking ""git reset"" will revert a committed and pushed change (sometimes people push early).  In general, this is probably not what you intend.<p>""git reset"" moves branch pointers around.  So when you ""git reset HEAD^"", you are really saying you want to move your current branch and HEAD (the thing that indicates where you are in the tree) to the prior commit.  The current commit still exists but can be ignored.<p>Speculation now, but I <i>think</i> it is right... This same understanding applies to the ""unstaging"".  The staging area is another tree node, and when you say ""git reset HEAD"" on the staged file, you are moving it back into the HEAD state.<p>One note on unstaging and other resetting... You can reset --soft or --hard.  --soft (default) means that you want to dirty up your directory with the differences between the file's current revision and the reset revision.  This is useful if you are cleaning up an unpublished branch (using reset to undo).<p>""git reset"" could be called ""git move-my-branch-tag"" and make more sense.",1310676449

It depends on how you define a design pattern, and how you generalize that definition to mathematics. The way that I define design patterns, I would disagree.<p>I define design patterns as ""an abstracted, re-usable piece of functionality that <i>cannot be made into a library</i>."" I think that the non-libraribility is the defining feature of design patterns: it's why you have to learn to implement them, instead of just linking to them like most other forms of re-usable functionality[1]. As soon as you can figure out how to factor that functionality into a library (or template or inheritable class or interface or whatever), it's no longer a design pattern.<p>When I look at mathematics, I would consider that to be mostly a collection of <i>libraries</i> rather than <i>design patterns</i>. Theorems, obviously, are more like libraries because you can simply plug in the antecedents and get out the sequents without looking at the proof. There are also things like design patterns, techniques that you can apply in related domains. However, mathematicians have a pathological urge to turn these techniques into theorems by proving properties about what they will do and when they can be applied. The result is that math tends to have many libraries but few surviving design patterns at any point.<p>[1] Note that this definition is language-dependent. It also dovetails somewhat with the ""design patterns are evidence of an underpowered language"" line of thought, but is distinct because it deals with extensible functionality rather than built-in functionality.",1310675599

That's what my example comparing my home town (backwoods Connecticut) with San Francisco is about--it simply doesn't make any sense at all to compare a hundred acres in rural farmland with the equivalent housing situation in a major metropolis.  Cost doesn't really enter into it.<p>The type of housing you can afford is a quality of life issue as much or more than it is a cost of living issue.  If you live in San Francisco or New York, you accept a smaller living space than you'd get elsewhere.  In return, you get access to nightlife, concert venues, and other amenities that can only be had in a densely-populated area.<p>If living on a hundred acres of woodland is important to you, you will not live in San Francisco.  If being able to bike to work is important to you, you will not live in Los Angeles.  If staying out of the cold is important to you, you will not live in Minneapolis.  Money won't buy you any of these things.<p>At some levels, it may <i>seem</i> that it's just an issue of money.  You <i>can</i>, of course, buy a detached, single-family house in San Francisco. It'll cost you millions, but you can do it if you're rich enough.  Attempting to paint this as a difference in cost of living, however, is simply disingenuous--the detached home in San Francisco is the local equivalent of a mansion in my home town.  It's not equivalent, any more than hiring Michael Franti to make a personal trip out to Connecticut to play for you would be equivalent to catching a show at a local concert hall.<p>And, finally, it's important to remember that unless you're living entirely hand-to-mouth, not all of your income goes to living expenses.  If you're in the well-paid engineer club, then hopefully only a relatively small portion of your income goes to living expenses.  Moving from a cheap location to an expensive one may increase that portion, but it doesn't make any sense at all to multiply your current income by a constant factor to determine the ""equivalent"" in a different location.  That's what that calculator does, and it's deceptive and wrong.",1310675528

Your entire post was just comparing .Net to Ruby and saying that Ruby is better.  It comes off as a bad sales pitch.  Even in your update, you're still saying that .Net developers should try Rails.  If you think that .Net developers are too isolated and close-minded, the solution is not to desperately pitch Ruby as some cure-all.  There are a million ways to develop software that involve neither .Net <i>nor</i> Ruby, and you didn't mention any of them.",1310674599

2764867,comment,2763575,2763575,2,0,tzs,,,"I have no philosophical objection to collecting tax for states other than the one in which my employer is located, provided two things are done first:<p>1. Rates are simplified. I do not want to deal with every separate county, city, or special tax district that has its own rate. I want to be able to look up the rate I should charge based on just a 5 digit zip code.<p>2. Reporting is simplified. I do not want to deal with almost 50 different requirements for how to submit the collected taxes. Keep in mind that each state needs to know how much tax was collected in each tax district so that they can apportion it correctly, so at the very least they are going to want some kind of breakdown from me.<p>My suggestion to deal with #1 would be for the states to get together and create a single source for rate data, updated quarterly, so that merchants could grab all the rate data from one place.<p>For #2, my suggestion would be for the states to agree to collect for each other. I'm in Washington, so already have to collect tax for Washington sales, and am already set up to report the appropriate data to Washington. So why not make it so when I report to Washington, I report sales from all states? Washington can them break that out by state and send the appropriate money and distribution information to the other states. Same goes for the other states--California merchants would report all sales and pay all collected taxes to California, which would then pay Washington for the sales that were to Washington, and so on.<p>If it were done this way, it would have minimal impact on merchants. We'd basically just end up getting bigger tax tables than we now get, and submitting more data to where we already submit data.",1310674423

How about food, clothe, transportation? Are those things also more than twice more expensive? No way. For example, you can live without a car in SF because public transportation there is decent. In Miami you need a car as you need your legs.<p>And I'm not even considering the benefits that a globalized world brings to ""expensive"" cities. In other words, if we assume that everything is 138% more expensive in SF then savings will also be 138% larger and, in the ""equivalence equation"", you have to factor in the purchasing power of San Franciscans in markets outside SF and Miami, otherwise you'd be saying something of the sorts of: To maintain your standard of living when you move to SF from Miami you need to make 138% more money (and by the way, you'll get a 20 days vacation in Spain for free).",1310673678

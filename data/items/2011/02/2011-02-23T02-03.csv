2252792,comment,2252152,2252152,0,0,icey,,,"I would very much like to have <a href=""http://startups.ycombinator.com/startups/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startups.ycombinator.com/startups/</a> and have a more narrow focus on startup related news and entrepreneurship.<p>The constant stream of front-paged political arguments and noticeable increase in mean-spirited commentary in the threads has caused me to spend most of my time on HN logged out. It used to be that I'd read the comments before I'd even read the story to see if the story was worth reading. I wonder if it's possible that pg doesn't notice the degradation in comment quality as much because the trolls have been here baiting him since the very early days.<p>I don't think HN is irrevocably broken; I'm glad that pg is helming the ship and I think he's doing an admirable job of it so far (I think the ranking algorithm in use for the front-page stories is one of the best anywhere). But HN used to be great, and now it's merely good.<p>I think that a lot of people who have been here for a long time have thought about what's changed here, and how it could be fixed. I know I've littered more than a few mailboxes with lengthy emails about what I think is wrong, and what I think the solution is. Reading this thread kind of tells the story - a point has come where the community is large enough to have factions that value different things. ""Anything that good hackers might find interesting"" works when you have a small group of people engaged in conversation. It's less useful when you have mobs of people who have come with different ideas of what they want to get out of this site.<p>In the early days, HN felt like it was a problem solving tool; a way to find out what cool things people were working on, and occasionally to ask for advice. The community was humble, competent, and full of people who actually made things. Those people are still here, but there's a self-aggrandizing element here as well.  The group of people who seem to think that someone else's success somehow reflects poorly on themselves, the bloviators and blowhards who believe that a volume of arguments somehow makes up for the measurable factuality of arguments. I don't really know what the solution is to this. I thought if there was a way to ignore people it might make a difference, but after some experimentation I think that that's a dead end - there is too much chance of missing something truly interesting from doing that.<p>All this being said, HN has had an immeasurable positive impact on my life - The people that I've met through HN (both in person and virtually) are some of the smartest, most amazing people I've known. I'll get to use the things I've learned from HN (and more importantly from the people in it) for the rest of my life. I can't think of another site on the net that has come even close to making such a huge impact.<p>I can't imagine missing out on all of this if HN had been invite-only when it launched. I didn't know anyone when I first came here. I didn't even know who Paul Graham was.<p>Instead of complaining about it, I think those of us that have been here for awhile owe it to pg to actively try to improve the community. It's become too large for him to handle on his own. Yes, there are moderators, but they're an invisible hand that only act as a corrective force.<p>We're a creative lot. I'm sure we can figure out some way to improve this community from the inside.",1298429781

You give it a list of events, the days-of-the-month they're due, and the number of days you'd like to be notified in advance. Every day, it goes through the list, checks each to see if you haven't done it yet for the month and if the current day is w/in the window you specified. If true to both, you get an email. If you don't mark the event as done, it rolls over to the next day, so it won't forget even when you do.<p>I realize this is ""just another calendar app,"" but I think that pestering/nagging feature is pretty cool.

2252743,comment,2250037,2251467,0,0,derefr,,,"Spam filtering is still required in this case, by definition: potential clients and spammers are not disjoint sets. Any completely unknown sender who sends you a message has no metadata attached to their message which may enable trust rating; therefore, the only thing you'll be able to judge them on is the quality and relevance of the message content itself.<p>However, assuming ubiquitous identity servers, of the kind Diaspora is trying to enable, each identity server could be subscribed to a feed of updates for a respective channel key. So, for example, you could have an identity server at work from which other employees could pull your current ""work"" channel key, or an identity server at a hackathon meet-up from which other people who came to the meet-up could pull your current ""meet-up"" channel key. Then, people who contacted you would be contacting you with the trust score of the identity server pre-applied (you'd assign your work identity server a high score, because only employees may be members, while the meet-up score would be lower because anyone could show up and sign in, etc.) If you only want to deal with people you've physically met, you can just draw a line saying to discard messages below a certain trust score, and be done with it.<p>If not, though, channels are still a helpful complement to spam filtering, as each channel could have its own spam filter trained on channel content—so something that would be perfectly fine in a ""work.offtopic"" channel would be considered spam in a ""work.ontopic"" channel. Because people would likely have multiple means of contacting them (you'd have access to most people you actually knew through multiple channels), individual channels could be much harsher about rejecting content—probably just silently discarding it for everyone but the sender, and either acknowledging the rejection to the sender, or just saying nothing. (If clients sent a message to all relevant channels simultaneously, and messages from different channels with the same ID were re-combined for other clients, this wouldn't be so much of a problem.)<p>Any extension to this concept would simply be sticking an identity server in a new place: one sitting on each person's phone or computer providing temporary access to a ""proximity channel"" that constantly shifts (so as soon as you go out of range, you're unsubscribed from the identity server and can no longer send messages), topic-oriented free-to-join identity servers (basically equivalent to IRC servers, except that they don't have to handle message routing themselves), and so on.",1298428488

For the data to be truly polarised you would expect the graph to be U-shaped: lots of 5s and lots of 1s and little in between.<p>What this data shows is that lots of people are giving these films a chance (and paying money to do so) who aren't really that engaged with the genre, or niche. That's a big validation of the studios' design strategy for the films.<p>An illustrative example I can think of that isn't in the top 20 is <i>District 9</i>: a very familiar 'niche-y' core genre, a fairly predictable plotline, but with enough influences from other genres to keep a diverse audience interested. <i>The Dark Knight</i> would probably be another.",1298427801

Everyone with YC-meme contributes in a manner that exemplifies YC-meme.  If someone comes along and doesn't have that meme, their posts tend to not be what the memesters want.  So, members use their voting powers to reduce that person's karma.  Eventually they either leave, get ignored by all, or become infected with YC-meme.<p>Now, open up the community to everyone.  At first, YC-meme is still dominant.  Only 1% of people without it are able to write posts in a style similar enough to gather karma.  Let's say they have RD-meme, which has about 80% overlap with YC-meme.  Great.<p>The problem is, soon, there isn't 1% of the community with RD-meme, there's 10%.  Who can (and do) re-enforce RD-meme posts, because it's what <i>they</i> want.  People can even get lucky and simply contribute 'good' posts, long enough that they get a decent karma score, and so can re-enforce different memes.<p>What makes it WORSE is that what's acceptible is what's visible, so with more RD-meme posts, RD-meme posts become more likely, as the probability that they get 'punished' decreases.<p>End result:  Community-dilution runaway.<p>There are a few 'cures' I can think of, but most are fairly prescriptive:<p>1.

2.  A <i>very</i> high bar for moderation, with active participation.  Given that the people most likely to have YC-meme are also likely to be busy, this might be doomed by design.
3.  ""Proof"" required for contribution.  Great way to kill off your community.
4.  Invitations.  Either so easy to get as to be meaningless, or so hard as to stagnate the community.

The hardcover costs a bit more to print, but not significantly much more, because most of the cost of producing a book is in the writing and editing and marketing. The difference between hardcover and paperback is an artificial marketing distinction: Hardcovers seem more substantial, and (more importantly) they come out earlier, so they sell to the people with more money than patience and with a taste in bookbinding. They are therefore priced higher to take advantage of those folks' willingness to pay.<p>I suspect that so long as e-readers cost hundreds of dollars (and, more importantly, e-books have DRM and can't be borrowed or resold) they will naturally tend to be priced like hardcovers, or worse.",1298426514

Perhaps the kind of tech that was being done in Silicon Valley had a more plausible transition to non-defense uses, or perhaps defense-related contracts just continued a bit longer there than in SoCal?",1298426489

The few invite-based communities I've been a part of started to degrade as the social graph grew out and started to pick up the occasional undesirable.<p>It was harder to get rid of them because they knew someone who knew someone, and trying to push them out had a network effect. It might be obvious to someone removed by 3+ levels that a bad element is bad, but the person who invited them might not see it.",1298426447

It's all ""up there"" too. I don't see the distinction. My email is ""online"" and my cloud-stored data is online. What's the difference? And one could argue that email is -- at times, at least -- even more sensitive than actual data.<p>(3) To fear ""only ... a hardware failure or a nasty virus"" is shortsighted: failure to maintain multiple instances of data, both on- and off-line alike, is far more risky indeed.",1296543443

They have no technical talent, and I'd be joining to build the product, do sysadmin work, recruit talented developers, etc.<p>The company already has some value, as they've already purchased a company and are basically throwing out the old team and building this new product.<p>The CEO wants a dedicated employee who will devote the next few years to this product, and I've been told I'd be considered ""part of the founding team"". So they offered me a 4% equity and a salary that's about half of what I'd make as a sr. engineer elsewhere. This seems like a generous offer for an early employee, though I'm clearly not being thought of as a co-founder.<p>As I was negotiating/being sold on this company, I was under the impression that equity meant stock given to me by the company over a period of four years (with the typical one year ""cliff""). I found out that it's actually stock options that they're offering. So I'll have to pay for them (likely at a high valuation due to the initial investment). I'd be taking quite a salary hit, so I was thinking that the equity would make up for this. But I don't even know if I'll be able to afford to purchase the stock available through stock options.<p>Is it normal for ""equity"" to be considered stock options, and not actual stock?

  I noticed a post recently about a TC competitor, and well I've been planning to work on a startup focused blog as well, mainly because TC covers mainstream news and bigger companies.

I wanted to get some feedback and see if you guys would be interested.<p>I had been wanting to do this mainly to improve my writing (since Im knee deep in this daily anyways) but its clear it will benefit a lot of others. Some topics I've considered, maybe include lean methods in each post, so you can see how successful startups have applied real learning techniques to improve their products, or for some of the cool startups out there (think, hipmunk, mint, mixpanel, forrst etc.) do an interview to discuss their basic stack and tech journey. I think it'd be a gem. In any case, if I start another TC alernative, are there any startups that would appreciate something more focused on niche startup topics, or startup news? I would love to hear from startups. I've started writing about a few cool startups already and would love to hear from more.<p>any thoughts are appreciated and as always feel free to get in touch.",1296541984

When the Subscriber visits a known Publisher, Readability records the visit.<p>4. At the end of the billing period, Readability dishes out cash, divided up according to how many times the Subscriber visited each known Publisher.<p>I understand this model well because it is almost exactly the same model I dreamt up in 2008, that Contenture launched with circa 2009 and that Kachingle filed a business method patent application for in 2007 (as I recall).

Revolutions always have a myriad of causes and a myriad of factors that help or hinder them, a technology alone is never enough to bring down a dictatorship. I do think, though, that technologies can help revolutions and maybe even be the one deciding factor that makes them successful.<p>Take the peaceful German revolution in 1989: East Germans weren’t hungry, they weren’t even poor, they weren’t unemployed and their tyrants were, as tyrants go, relatively mild. But East Germans could watch West German TV and compare, see that West Germans were richer, had more choice, more chances, more freedoms and more attractive holiday destinations. Would there have been the same mass demonstrations without West German TV, without information from the West?<p>The trigger of the fall of the Berlin Wall itself was of course famously also East and West German TV and radio [2].<p>[1] Is this a correct usage of “anachronistic”? I got quite confused as to whether it is, searched around and eventually gave up.<p>[2] In 1989, the East German regime wanted to slowly and in a controlled fashion open the border for their own citizens because of continued mass demonstrations and pressure from abroad. The plan to do so was announced on November 9 at a press conference. Asked when the new rules would come into force, a member of the Politbüro said erroneously that they would come into force immediately. West German TV and radio quickly spread the news that the Wall was open and because of the masses of people coming to the Wall it was actually really open that same evening.

It&#x27;s not even close to being the Internet.<p>It is Facebook&#x27;s walled garden which they control, they decide what lives there and what remains, what gets kicked out.<p>You know what is worse, it is not that Facebook is providing something that is not the Internet, but the worse is - it will give a precedence to such business practices that may effectively kill the Internet as a medium, as we know it today, in India and turn it into the cable company model commodity where we have to buy packs of &quot;access X, Y, Z services at speed A&quot;, or even &quot;access sites X, Y, K&quot; when there is another pack &quot;X, K, M services pack&quot;.<p>It will affect innovations, new services in a drastic manner. Can you imagine what the status of Facebook would have been if the Internet all over the world was in a way that provided Orkut for free because Google paid for it by including it in its &quot;Google Free Basics&quot; pack? I don&#x27;t think Facebook would have been here at all.<p>Now, let&#x27;s say Amazon arrived in India before Flipkart, Snapdeal (Indian e-commerce portals) and jumped on an &quot;India Free Basics&quot; plan and now people have free access to Amazon but this guy in Bangalore who started Flipkart couldn&#x27;t afford to jump on that &quot;India Free Basics&quot; because hey, they didn&#x27;t have deep pockets from the beginning. The list of what-if examples can be endless here, I just hope you get the idea.<p>> Nobody else is going to give full internet to them for free.<p>Indian Govt actually provides highly subsidised Internet in rural areas and is working to make it more accessible. And ideas like Facebook Free Basics are actually going to harm such initiative by the Govt giving them a reason that people already have &quot;Free Basics&quot;. I mean not saying this is how it&#x27;s gonna end up exactly but let Facebook and Network operators have their way right now and something similar is waiting for us in the future. Sounds like a mild dystopian story? Well, read about &quot;license raj&quot; in India and related stories.<p>> They will be stuck with nothing.<p>No, they won&#x27;t. They will get the Internet, maybe few months, or a couple of years down the line - slowly (and this is already happening) which is better than not getting &quot;the Internet&quot; ever, or when it&#x27;s too late.<p>By the way, what stops Facebook from kicking WikiPedia and Khan Academy out (let&#x27;s just say they are there) later on and rather bring Snapchat, Vine and Instagram in its place? Now, you may say it&#x27;s better to watch cat gifs and share selfies than having &quot;no Internet at all&quot;, where again you&#x27;ll be missing the point that &quot;this is NOT the Internet&quot; and that line of thinking is unfortunate in my humble opinion.<p>A lot of these points have been covered in these videos by a local standup comedy group (in order): <a href=""https://youtu.be/mfY1NKrzqi0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/mfY1NKrzqi0</a>, <a href=""https://youtu.be/W0w_YhZUYeA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/W0w_YhZUYeA</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAQWsTFF0BM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAQWsTFF0BM</a>",1451098398

But... say &#x27;method&#x27; and/or &#x27;procedure&#x27; in front of the wrong people, and you will be taken to task on the semantic meaning of such words, and what is proper and correct within a variety of technical fields.<p>Similarly, what is meant by &quot;functional&quot; (the adjective) is also up for debate. Some people, when they hear the word &quot;functional&quot; think you&#x27;re speaking in terms of &quot;functionality&quot; perhaps in the context of user acceptance testing, and the proving of a minimum viable product. Others will think you&#x27;re referring to the &quot;pure functional&quot; programming paradigm, like as in the sense of Haskell.<p>Still others will think you are simply referring directly to a specific Java method, or a specific JavaScript function, and correct you accordingly, and not consider whether the terms have any deeper meaning or context at all. (like: &quot;<i>no, this is Java, so it&#x27;s a method...</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>no, JavaScript only has functions, not methods...</i>&quot;)<p>That being said, I&#x27;ve always felt that these terms have such broad, generalizable definitions, since they&#x27;ve sort of been borrowed from layman&#x27;s English, and repurposed within a specific context.<p>Is there <i>REALLY</i> a difference between a &quot;method,&quot; a &quot;procedure,&quot; and a &quot;function&quot; proper?",1451098345

10793096,comment,10791695,10791695,0,0,omonra,,,"My two thoughts on this:<p>1. I bet a large portion of this phenomenon is related to the current US divorce laws (basically a woman with a child can divorce a high-income husband and claim a large portion of his income for child support / maintenance).<p>Therefore marrying people of your &#x27;social circle&#x27; is a certain way to mitigate this effect (ie if your spouse is a high-level attorney rather than a secretary, you have a much lower risk of it happening to you).<p>2. Author kinda assumes the reader is an idiot in some places. For example: &quot;As it becomes harder for many people to “marry up”.<p>Well, no. &quot;People&quot; never really married up. Women with looks had a chance to marry men of higher social standing. The reverse (man marrying a woman of higher social standing) was very much an exception.<p>So basically what this means is that men of today are not as interested in marrying women beneath their social status as they were in the past.<p>I guess that women&#x27;s liberation had a lot to do with this phenomenon. If one is an intelligent woman, she can simply go to a good school and get a career - instead of her only choice in life being marriage to a rich man. So that actually sounds like a not terrible thing for such women.",1451098230

Unfortunally, you will need to hunt from several places to go after any half-decent implementation of any decent-enough language.<p>But do anything first. So, take this tutorial and complete it. If after it you wanna move...<p>I&#x27;m working in my own language, and after read like hundreds of links/blogs/books/etc, you will find that a lot of that is heavily biased torwards parsing, LISPys, FORTHs, and ultra-heavy-monads-worship or academic complexting that will make your head spin. After all that read, I&#x27;m still confused. Because a lot of things are not simpler or obvious in the way how make a blog or a ecommerce site can be.<p>So, read a part of the list I have collected:<p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/2ocw2r/how_to_create_a_programming_language/cmy71xn"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/2ocw2r/how_to_creat...</a><p>----<p>Syntax is very important, but after read a lot, I think that do the parsing stuff is not the very best <i>first</i> step.<p><i></i>INSTEAD DO THE AST WALKER<i></i>. Seriously. Get clear how the the AST can be processed and focus in that. Changes in the AST will cause heavy impacts in your parsing stuff, and a lot of question need to get clarified first. For example, from the link above:<p><pre><code>    My first questions? How make a REPL, a debugger, how implement pattern matching, type checking, if a interpreter can be fast enough, if possible to avoid to do a whole VM for it, etc...\n\n    Exist a LOT of practical questions that are left as &quot;a exercise for the reader&quot; that need clarifications.\n</code></pre>\nSo, my advice:<p>- Get a list of what do you want for your language. Then think harder and try to remove features and get to the core of it.<p>- From the above, start to understand the details. For example: I wanna to do GO-style concurrency, so... how implement GO-style concurrency? If that is not solved, your syntax is pointless. That is why try to fill the &quot;core&quot; of the language as much as possible before to commit to the GUI (aka:syntax) of it.<p>- Then do a interpreter. Is FAR easier. Even if you wanna do a compiler, start here is more easier.<p>- On the side, play with your syntax, and imagine how write in the language could be. Then start to think &quot;to make this syntax do that, how I can do inside the guts of the compiler&quot;? But you can delay the parser for a while.<p>When the time come for the parsing, probably is better to do as a top-down parser and/or pratt-parser. I don&#x27;t waste time with parser generators. If your disagree, ok with me ;)<p>I have find that use F# is great for this stuff. However, OCalm have more code-samples (ie: ML languages are made for this!). Lisp will work great if your are insane to like that ;). Hardcode C-developer? Tons of code to look, but not very much in clarity to see.",1451097084

I don&#x27;t see the clouds from these megacorps getting smaller any day.<p>I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m talking about, of course, but it takes stronger arguments than <i>because quantum tunnelling and the speed of light</i> to make this case.",1451095754

Car ownership is definitely not needed in Seattle, Portland, NYC, SF, and probably many other cities.

I didn&#x27;t realize that in the beginning, but now I do. You have to know that there&#x27;s a lot of skill and practice involved in making the way the players pass the ball (in soccer/basketball/hockey), the decisions they make to distribute the ball (e.g., attack from the middle, from the side, one-two passes and sometimes, individual dribbling skills). These are all very difficult to do for any amateur (or even some professional) players, and it becomes to see it AND appreciate that only after you&#x27;ve played soccer (basketball, hockey, or any sports you name it) yourself. I could watch a soccer game without any goals being scored and yet still get enjoyment out of it.<p>Another somewhat related analogy would be that I was never trained in playing any musical instruments; I never am interested in learning how to play one myself. But when I see an orchestra playing a random classical music (i.e. the kind of music I personally find boring), I still appreciate that they are showing off skill that they practiced to acquire for many years.",1451095566

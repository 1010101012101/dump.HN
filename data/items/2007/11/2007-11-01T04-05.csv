The true, sheer size of some companies ranked much lower are actually much larger with regard to revenues and profits...they're just not trading at 55 times earnings.<p>But, Google's market cap is indeed 5th.  That's incredible any way you slice it.",1193892437

There's tabs for indentation, and there's... well, code. What else do you need?<p>Could you give some examples of these cases? I really haven't come up with any in the past few weeks, and the readability is so much better with variable width.",1193891891

Does anyone want to implement it with me?",,"So the market for race registrations (i.e. road races, triathlons, etc.), camp registrations, and other active event registrations is dominated by Active.com. They offer a set of solutions, but from having used it...well...the bottom line is that someone could do a lot better.<p>They charge $3 per registration they process (so their gross margin is on the order of $1.5 - $2 per registration, which ends up being quite a lot of money when you take into account that many marathons have 10-20K runners.<p>I'm thinking about creating a dead-easy, on-demand registration system and pairing it with either/or a) other event management tools, b) some sort of network for racers (e.g. create groups, share photos, review products, see stats, etc.).<p>Revenues would come from the registrations, as well as ads in the vertical (which I'm guessing have a relatively high CPC/M because of the fact that this demographic buys gear quite often).<p>Thoughts on the idea? Anyone interested in building this with me?",1193890156

But that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a software solution available to any company who wishes to do so.<p>The &quot;let Amazon run it&quot; standard response is I think problematic: the cloud market is extremely concentrated. This is not a good thing in term of competition and diversification. We have already seen many times a bad software update shutting down a whole cloud service. Having more concentration is only going to make our infrastructures less resilient.",1448618326

This is a good thing, they&#x27;re there to support you, as you&#x27;re the core purpose of the organisation.<p>Take this as an opportunity for yourself.  If you have worked in a corporate environment before, you&#x27;re probably familiar with policies, documentation (not code, organisational), etc.  If not, then don&#x27;t worry.<p>This is you&#x27;re chance to shape that from the start.<p>If you&#x27;re the owner of a product or part of a product, you have a lot of leverage and power, just don&#x27;t use it recklessly.<p>For example:  I joined a company with no job descriptions.  When the expansion came, I got to write my job description.  My department (me) had no Statement of Purpose, so I wrote the Statement of Purpose.<p>We also had a training course on RACI (basically, a simple way whenever undertaking a task to make sure who is Responsible, Accountable, who should be Consulted, and who should be Informed).  It&#x27;s a simple idea, but well worth keeping in mind whenever doing something because an expansion means the amount of people that need to be &#x27;in the know&#x27; changes (in my case, from casual chatting and word-of-mouth) to making sure things were documented in emails.  It was different, but it helped.<p>The good thing is, you&#x27;re in expansion mode.  That means a lot of stuff can flow to you if communication well.<p>Don&#x27;t appear self-conceited (not saying you are, just don&#x27;t appear like that) by getting withdrawn.  Given your company was small, the boss or VP is probably close, so let your ambition (be it a specialist, manager of a product or part of a product, etc) be known to them.<p>Things can stay casual and personal, but with more and more people, things <i>will</i> go wrong if issues don&#x27;t get documented and followed-up more formally (from feature changes to un-communicated personal leave), simply as there&#x27;s many more people who will be out-of-the-loop and uninformed of events.<p>The transition phase was the worse for me, as others just didn&#x27;t get it.  There&#x27;d be a face-to-face conversation I&#x27;d not be involved in, because others were used to the &#x27;old way&#x27; and then things would escalate because someone key was out-of-the-loop and I&#x27;d get a question from the GM &#x27;why was this not done?&#x27;  It was a pain.  But you can get through it sooner if you adapt sooner.]",1448617879

I think two factors helped hugely with the adoption of Win95 and the surge in popularity of the PC over Macs at the time. One was mainstream adoption of the recently arrived Pentium CPUs. The other was the collapse in memory prices in 1996, which had been very expensive for many years. Now PCs had an OS that could take full advantage of these capabilities and the price of a powerful computer fell dramatically.

You better be using exactly the same org-mode version on all of your computers, because there is no concept of backward compatibility. Making matters worse, there is no restriction that changes have to be documented before the release. I got burned with some presentations when they made major changes to the exporters. The documentation consisted of a statement that they were working on the documentation.<p>ii. The documentation you find may or may not work. Google is hit or miss because in most cases your search will return an answer for a different version from the one you&#x27;re using.<p>This is not to say you shouldn&#x27;t use org-mode.

The problem is that real people are willing to believe and act upon this &quot;outrage&quot;, sometimes in an extreme manner, to avoid being on the &quot;wrong side&quot;.<p>This diagnosis is also too shallow. Just like people&#x27;s belief and actions in response to &quot;outrage&quot; has varied over time, the media&#x27;s sensationalism has varied over time, for example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalism</a><p>> Even the smallest infraction is justification for ruining lives. [...] Brendan Eich was ousted from his position at Mozilla for his donation years ago. A pizzeria owner was threatened with death for merely saying he wouldn&#x27;t serve gays. The mob retaliations are completely disproportionate to the &quot;crime&quot;.<p>These don&#x27;t strike me as compelling examples. Brendan Eich (whom, for the record, I did not think should be ousted and said so at the time in HN discussions) was not ousted for minding his own business making a private donation, that is a misrepresentation. He was ousted because of his defense of his donation, and even if that ruined his life, he was in a position to affect a lot of lives, and it&#x27;s reasonable (even if we disagree with them) for people to think it&#x27;s unfortunate but necessary.<p>As for &quot;A pizzeria owner was threatened with death for merely saying he wouldn&#x27;t serve gays.&quot;---gays receive threats of death and violence, and actual death and violence, for merely being gay, and while there&#x27;ve been spikes in response to e.g. Obergefell, this has generally been decreasing, fortunately.

But usually there are more nuanced explanations for wrong directions. For example it might be that OpenStack seemed to be heading in a better direction in 2012. Maybe it was reasoned that it&#x27;s worth it to hedge against AWS lock-in and you can always easily fall back to Amazon, or even mix and match AWS and OpenStack. Etc.<p>If OpenStack worked well I don&#x27;t see any inherent reason why you&#x27;d have to be bigger than Guardian to use it for autoscaling and load balancing.",1448615119

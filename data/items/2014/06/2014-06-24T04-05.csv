Downtime - You seemed to gloss over my primary point. The downtime today could have been completely avoided if Heroku did not opt to do a 2pm EST scheduled maintenance. This was a very large risk they took and it blew up in everyone&#x27;s face.<p>As far as resolving downtime. I stand by my original statement that a PaaS like Heroku cannot recover as fast on average as another solution. They have too many customers that they have to get up and running.<p>5) Buildpacks - I&#x27;ve been fielding this one on Twitter all day and am considering writing another blog post. I didn&#x27;t really give much weight to this one and that opens it up to attack pretty easily. Here is my point:<p>Buildpacks in general do not suck. Heroku&#x27;s implementation of Buildpacks sucks. Customizing Heroku buildpacks is a nightmare. Maintaining said fork is nearly impossible. There is no versioning of the buildpacks. There is no way to know if/when slugs are updated and my fork is no longer useable or needs to merge in upstream changes. Getting anything into the official buildpacks is a political nightmare. Adding CLI tools not in the heavily stripped down Ubuntu AMI is a gigantic pain in the ass.<p>But if that is not enough for you I&#x27;ll end this point with David Dollar who did a ton of work while at Heroku with its buildpacks <a href=""https://twitter.com/ddollar/status/481201978391801857"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/ddollar/status/481201978391801857</a><p>re: puppet - I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re hammering me for Puppet as I never mentioned it. You seemed to assume that this is what we will use.<p>3) Pricing - I dismiss most of your argument unless we&#x27;re talking about Heroku&#x27;s database hosting. Their DB hosting is awesome and top-notch. Their app hosting has become a less than stellar. I don&#x27;t even know what I&#x27;m paying for anymore. To me managed devops means I don&#x27;t ever have to deal with pager duty or I can just hand customers over to someone after we launch their product. That&#x27;s not Heroku, not by a long shot. At best we&#x27;re getting security fixes and system updates applied. At worst we are paying a premium on resold EC2 instances for a deploy shell script that has been freely available for a while now.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you but I don&#x27;t really spend that much time swapping the underlying language. At least not without some heavy consideration, what we go with is usually thought out from the start of the project. To me, I&#x27;m not interested in the least in being able to swap out MRI for JRuby with a change of a line. In nearly 10 years of professional Rails development I have maybe had to do this twice. Upgrading Ruby is a different story, but that is also not something that should be done lightly.<p>Today&#x27;s post was a culmination of years of frustration with the platform. I&#x27;ve had it, we&#x27;re done with it. Moving on. Good riddance.",1403585803

It is one story to perform a deep refactoring on a C++ or Java code with 95% tests code coverage where either compiler or tests will pickup things for you. And it is a completely another story to do a refactoring on a PHP frontend code w/o any compiler/static analyzer and w/o any tests where your best tool is search-and-replace. Even the &quot;depth&quot; of safe refactoring will be very different in those two cases.",1403585694

The following summer I worked as a &quot;Application Development Intern&quot; and made $10/hr. For the following three years I worked part-time at a local software consulting firm and made $15/hr and part-time as a C-S TA and made 10/hr. I paid off my debt 2 months after graduation and I got lots of great experience.<p>My story is very typical of my C-S and IS major classmates. And now those same internships in my Alma mater&#x27;s town are paying 17-18/hr.<p>So when people say that can&#x27;t afford to get a C-S degree I think they either don&#x27;t know the score or want to be one of the &quot;too cool for school&quot; kids in the valley, but lack the proper reasoning (I don&#x27;t use that term for people with good reasons).",1403584971
7936225,comment,7934177,7934821,2,0,jjoonathan,,,"You have a point, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning that the fundamental observation behind the complaint is still sound: incentives are rigged to guide smart people towards pursuits of dubious utility compared to what they would otherwise choose to work on. Let&#x27;s look at a rough picture of incentives for a new graduate:<p>1. Helping the poor: $0 (maybe $12k if you count a fellowship)<p>2. Trying to Cure Cancer: $25k/yr, bump to $40k after 6 years<p>3. Engineering Medical Devices, Airplanes, etc: $60k/yr<p>4. Trying to Build the Next Twitter: $100k/yr-$150k/yr<p>5. Helping Rich People Game the System to Get Richer: $150k/yr, $300k/yr after a few years if successful<p>I have placed these in decreasing order of social value per my own judgement. Note that salary has precisely the opposite trend. The probability of that particular relative order occurring by chance is 1 in 120. I could add other jobs to the list to drop the probability even further.<p>In some cases the market is conveying valuable information. If we have enough !Software Engineers, it makes sense to depress their wages as a way of discouraging people from entering those fields. Similarly, it makes sense to encourage smart people to pursue roles with a lot of leverage (in the value creation sense, not the bargaining sense), which is a plausible excuse for sending smart people into finance (not one that I buy, but it&#x27;s plausible).<p>But in other cases we can identify the information that the market is conveying and pass judgement with the opposite conclusion. By design, the market rewards those who feed and clothe wealthy people and punishes those who feed and clothe the poor and penniless. In this instance the market&#x27;s reasoning is transparent enough to judge and few would rule in its favor (&quot;necessary evil&quot; is the best I&#x27;ve heard, and then only in the context of the circular &quot;it&#x27;s the best system we&#x27;ve tried&quot; argument).<p>Another negative example would be medical research. Next time someone you care about is sick or dying and has run out of options, reconsider the wisdom of our system in spending ~3% of all medical expenditures on research. Also remember that much of that is governmental -- if the market had its way, that figure would be even lower. The market&#x27;s reasoning is transparent: a doctor, insurance company, or drug company can threaten to withhold the service or good they provide in order to capture a fraction of the value they create. A researcher can&#x27;t do that, at least not effectively (their product only appreciates in value once they no longer control it). So they are systematically undervalued and the options that your loved one has are artificially reduced as a result of this.<p>Market-based incentives have huge problems. The million dollar question (many trillion dollar question) is how to fix them.",1403584965

If you had a top notch ops team you are still going to have outages in the middle of the business day. This team of ops guys you hire, guess what? They are not going to be deploying at 1am every day, that is not sustainable. They are going to deploy in the middle of the day, and guess what, they will make a mistake. And guess who notices outages first most times? Customers.<p>Heroku&#x27;s uptime is typically in the 99.9%&#x27;s, I don&#x27;t think you can do the same with one ops guy, maybe you will get lucky, however it is more likely that you won&#x27;t.<p>5) Buildpacks<p>Build packs are an AMAZING abstraction. Just think about how you would solve the following without buildpacks:<p>5.1) Install libgeos on all the hosts running a specific application?<p>5.2) Create and scale new worker instances on demand?<p>5.3) How do you setup logging for all these servers?<p>5.4) Health checks for these services (tcp, http)<p>5.5) Alerting and automatic failover<p>* pssh? That will work fine until you spin up a second server and forget all the incatations to get your software up and running.\n * Puppet? I am sorry but Puppet, chef and their ilk are horrible, who knows what state any machine is ever in at any point in time. humans will inevitably forget to ensure absent, or make an assumption about state in puppet land. Nevermind the slow feedback loop in puppet land. Oh hey you want to change all the servers running X to now run Y instead, good luck with that.\n * Mesos? Mesos is the best open source scheduler out there, Marathon makes it easy to deploy to and there are scripts to run easily on ec2. However if you want to install native dependencies (libgeos etc) you will still need to do one of the above things.\n * Docker? Docker is an amazing way to package your app up and ship it to run on Mesos, however how do you package docker apps and ship them? Guess what? Buildpacks.<p>Now consider this on Heroku\n(5.1) Add the <a href=""https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi</a>\n(5.2) Change your procfile\n(5.3) There are plugin&#x27;s for that<p>Oh hey you can also write your own language, write a buildpack for it, and deploy it to production without ever having to get an ops person anywhere to setup a server for you. I am sorry but that is nothing short of amazing.<p>2 and 4)<p>I agree 100%, it sucks to feel powerless and have no insight as to when things will be resolved, however if you work in any decent size org ops things will go down, and you will also have to wait to see any resolution. I agree it feels better to see people working busily in your office because you can see the sense of urgency. I<p>3) Pricing:<p>In regards to pricing: yes Heroku is very expensive. However for small and medium teams it is much cheaper than hiring an ops person. You also get an economy of scale when you use Heroku; Think of all the things heroku takes care of for you: automatic failover on hardware/software(segfaults)/vm issues. Disks filling up on some host (it is embarrassing how many times I have seen something as simple as this cause issues). Agility; You need to switch MRI out for JRuby or rubinius, no problem, just update your ruby &quot;version&quot; in your Gemfile. The Heroku platform is superior in almost every way for running small to medium size applications then any in house cooked alternative.<p>I am very familiar with the alternatives out there, I have contributed to dokku&#x27;s buildpack repo <a href=""https://github.com/progrium/buildstep"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/progrium/buildstep</a>, and have patched docker.<p>There is no good behind the firewall/on my vm/hardware alternative for heroku atm.

Not just to start a company, but when it comes time to commit resources to something, you find that even those who you believed would carry through, whether thanks to their track record or particularly convincing talk, will drop out.<p>I think of it as them having a high discount rate. The NPV of choosing a riskier path with later reward is thus lower than the stable, short term higher returns of stability, and the cost of &quot;flaking&quot; (the likelihood of you choosing not to do business with them ever again if you get to a position of such success that you can afford it) very low, especially if you are not currently in a position of success.

However, the <i>heavy lifting</i> is the daily operation work, not the knowledge to scale your app, HA/DR, CD/CI, etc.<p>Compared with the black-box model of Heroku, I vote for infra-as-code+desired state, e.g. you order, we cook.<p>Disclosure: I am the founder of visualops.io, a white-box devops automation service for AWS.",1403582777
7936143,comment,7935872,7935872,35,0,alphaoverlord,,,"This blog post seems like a jumble of ideas that are neither consistent or connected.<p>It starts with colleges should be more than job training centers, then ends with trying to create an accreditation process to prove value to external entities (of which I assume employers are a big part?).<p>It mentions the high cost of education, then describes how his current options are lacking because the number of classes in each major is limited.<p>He talks about how administrators are unnecessary, then suggests a similarly labor intensive accreditation system that requires experts, committees and other logistics that requires significant manpower and time/energy.<p>There are many flaws with the educational system, of which convenience, rigor, equality, and cost are a few the OP mentions, however his solution doesn&#x27;t seem to solve many of the challenges he mentions. I doubt that accreditation is a major cost to running a university - there are simply many other market forces (wanting facilities, a good football team, strong researchers that might not put teaching first) that causes the cost/benefit relationship to be the status quo. He finds it unconscionable that adjunct faculty don&#x27;t make enough money, then hopes to solve it with a free market - where honestly the things he values might not be the things many others value. He wants rigor - then critiques current accreditation processes that largely does what he suggests.<p>Each of the major MOOCs already are trying to accredite/build reputation/be rigorous. What OP is essentially doing is describing the idea of Udacity, Coursera, etc without the technical backend, the users to attract such a marketplace, connections, support, or actually being able to do a MOOC.",1403582679

Should he fear repression?  He should, the government wants to lock him up and throw away the key for revealing this, just like they did to Manning for what he revealed.  Actually, NPR spends most of its time bashing Snowden.<p>They seem gaga for dissidence in some foreign country, in a government that hasn&#x27;t existed for over two decades though.",1403582562

Postprocessors are better for some automatically task, like autoprefixing, media queries packing, polyfills, etc.<p>Unfortunately, Sass is not so flexible as JS.

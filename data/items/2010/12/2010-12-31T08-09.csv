(e.g. the spice shop woman in the article) These are the loans given out at 24%.<p>One of the issues is that a lot of borrowers take out IGLs and, once they have the cash in hand, end up spending it non-income generating activities, like weddings, or funerals, or baby births, or girl-child-attaining-puberty ceremonies.<p>There is another class of loans called ELs (Emergency Loans) that are <i>interest-free</i>, and meant for 'unforeseen emergencies' - typically critical medical treatment and funerals.<p>So yeah, when you take a loan at 24%, but spend the money on a 0%-loan-activity, problems abound.<p>There is a fairly large amount of education and training that has to take place amongst the local populace in terms of fiscal responsibility, and significant cultural obstacles to overcome to teach it to them.",1293785128

And often the first thread gets more room than later threads.<p>Third, the stack starts out small -- like, a few hundred bytes or so, depending on the amount of bloat in his platform's crt1.o (or equivalent).

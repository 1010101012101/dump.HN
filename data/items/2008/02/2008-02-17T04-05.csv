117365,comment,117127,117186,0,0,dcurtis,,,"But News.YC prides itself on having both a terrible user interface and a terrible user experience.<p>What kind of site calls a feature ""noprocrast"" without giving any detailed information about what it does? Only news.yc!<p>--edit<p>I wonder why I am being modded down. Maybe I said it too sarcastically. News.YC really does have a terrible interface. Look at the account settings page-- imagine yourself as a user who has never been there before. It's confusing and poorly documented. I love this site for the content and the simplicity, but Paul Graham is a programmer and spent very little time on the user experience, which makes sense. I don't blame him.<p>But it is still a bad interface. I'm pretty sure 99% of people who fill out the ""email"" field expect their email to somehow be visible to other users. It's right next to another field that IS visible.",1203223801

117363,comment,117123,117245,0,0,leaf,,,"It's been a really long time since I looked at this kind of stuff in any detail. The librarians I worked with at university would go on and on about semantic markup, and there were some very dedicated users that seemed to be willing to slog through the SGML nightmare. But, as soon as HTML came out it swamped the other technologies because it was so easy for people.<p>Has anything changed since the SGML days? Rhetorically, it all still sounds like a bunch of librarians complaining woefully that they can't do search properly if no one marks up their data properly.",1203223383

117361,comment,117118,117357,0,0,yters,,,"Ah, good.  I figured I wasn't getting the whole picture.  Something similar to objectivism makes sense to me.  I think there is such a thing as human nature, so everyone is ultimately made happy by the same things, at a certain granularity.  Morality's objectively good goal, in your framework, is to maximize happiness.<p>However, at this point I have to veer into territory considered ""religious,"" because such a claim requires at least an element of non-materialism to make sense of our moral intuitions.<p>At any rate, my views are not rigorously defined enough, and I'd benefit from critical, constructive discussion.  I'll check out your links and see if I can participate.",1203223301
117360,comment,117294,117294,0,0,pg,,,"The way you get admitted to good grad schools is by impressing specific profs.  It's much more personal than undergrad admissions.  And profs I know say the thing that impresses them most is good recommendations from other professors they know and trust.  So talk to current profs who like you and ask them who they know at grad schools you want to go to who would make good advisors for the kind of work you want to do.",1203223258
117359,comment,117254,117254,0,0,BobMacSlack,,,"While it would be interesting, my quick glance through the list showed there to be very little difference between the religions.  Yes, atheists prefer Python while Catholics prefer C, but the difference is really quite minimal.  My guess is the differences are not statistically significant.  I would run the numbers but at the moment I'm feeling lazy.  Just like every other moment.",1203223044

117357,comment,117118,117342,0,0,curi,,,"These are just starting points. I do think goals are themselves good or bad, but it's much harder to explain how you can <i>objectively</i> make assertions like that, so I wanted to make the lesser claim, for now: there are ways to explore morality objectively.<p>I'm definitely not claiming consistency of this sort is the only criterion of morality. Only that it's an important and objective one.<p>I don't mean to be a tease, but if I say too many things at once, I won't be understood as well. On the other hand, threads here go stale fast (usually in under a day), so I'm not sure how to ever get very far in explaining, here. By contrast, on another forum, I am in a thread that has been going for 4 years. And it's only 180 comments long -- so around 1 comment per 8 days.<p>I'll keep posting here if anyone replies. Or contact me, curi42 on AIM or curi@curi.us<p>So for depth, my best idea so far is to link longer, external writing. Here are two things I wrote about morality which explain my views a bit more:<p>Essay: <a href=""http://www.curi.us/blog/post/1252-xii"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.curi.us/blog/post/1252-xii</a><p>Dialog: <a href=""http://www.curi.us/blog/post/1169-morality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.curi.us/blog/post/1169-morality</a>",1203222566

117354,comment,117266,117298,0,0,cedsav,,,"I have just read the introduction, and it does seem that the author is looking far ahead, but I don't think it's too early to reflect on the ethical aspects of lethal robots.<p>Science moves faster than the field of ethics (e.g. cloning) and the US has already lethal robots on the battlefield. They are not autonomous yet, but we're certainly going there. When the robot 'assists' the decision by providing additional data (say an sensor detects a hidden weapon on an otherwise civilian-looking guy), it already skews the decision process. As the author mentions, there will be a point when the military will start to think that their robots are better at making the shoot/not shoot decisions...",1203222247

A very practical toolkit. Most of the major large religions, Christian, Muslim and Hindu also seem to favour widely used languages. Buddhist ranks Lisp very highly. Jewish coders like web languages like PHP, Perl and Javascript. Pagan's must all be running Apache servers, because Perl, PHP and Python dominate. Unitarians, true to there reputation, go for an eclectic mix that includes oddities like Groovy, D and LOGO. I think people's deepest held beliefs about how the world works does seem to lead them towards certain languages more than others.",1203221983

Or would you say that goals, such as Hitler's, were bad only b/c eugenics ultimately would be bad from an evolutionary point of view?<p>Then, there is a the problem of heroism, which is defined by a person's courage to pursue a noble goal even if its achievement is very unlikely.<p>Finally, by your definition, I could be one of the most moral people by making my goal ""do whatever I want.""

They might just be showing you a little bit of the story, but they are making use of the full-text of it in a big way.  I think that's worth noting here.<p>What I don't get is why the newspapers don't shut Google down in their robots.txt and then offer up a ""firehose""/API a la Twitter that anyone can get access to for a fee.  Yelp, Delicious, Twitter, Flickr, these services all have APIs that can be used to incorporate their content into other services, on their terms.

Mandatory education in America traces back to the culture (in general) and the enacted legislation (in particular) of the Puritan settlers of New England.  The Puritans believed in universal literacy so that everyone could read scripture.  They passed laws mandating child literacy and required towns to hire teachers to teach the children.  This was all mandated and required by the government and in some sense that can be construed taking choice AWAY from individuals rather than giving choice to them.  At the time this system and these requirements were unique in the world.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritan#Education"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritan#Education</a>",1255298178

875318,comment,875106,875106,0,0,angusdavis,,,"This is off on a tangent from the piece about Google and Rupert, but it's worth noting that in the general discussion of the demise of the traditional print newspaper business, few folks point out that the small community papers are in a better spot.<p>The real issue is that the national and world news has become a commodity that you can get from nearly anywhere.  At the same time, the quality of the reporting has declined.  Folks like Politico may represent the future of national reporting -- a leaner group of highly talented journalists getting interesting stories out.  But why pay to read about some major national news story in paper XXX when you have 1,000 other news sources to read essentially the same content?<p>Conversely, take a look at small community papers.  For example, my hometown paper is online at <a href=""http://bristolri.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bristolri.com/</a>.  These guys are doing just fine (I know the publisher).  You can't get their content anywhere else.  And you know what?  Average everyday people want to read local stories about the new school superintendent, the police report, the controversy over a local land development deal, the letters to the editor from their neighbors, etc.  They buy the paper.  Local advertisers still advertise. The paper is doing fine, and he's not alone -- lots of small papers are doing OK because their content has not been commoditized.<p>As for Rupert Murdoch, I think he's going in the wrong direction.  If I were him, I'd worry less about distribution rights on my essentially worthless commodity national news content, and I would instead set my target on the big ratings agencies.  The ratings agencies played a huge role in the credit crisis -- they basically gave bonds a gold star that were, in reality, crap.  They should be vulnerable with some sort of new model.  There are few companies positioned as well to destroy Moody's as News Corp / WSJ / Dow Jones with their depth of financial industry content / resources / etc.  I don't have any idea of exactly what a rating agency 2.0 would look like, but it would seem like a much more productive and valuable place for Rupert to put his focus.",1255296838

First of all, he's preaching to the choir by ignoring any need to even suggest a casual relationship between American economic prosperity and the availability of formal education.  Then, he ignores the difference between public spending on higher education and the availability of education overall.<p>>Education made America great;<p>I'd argue that individual freedom led to American prosperity, and individuals' choice to partake in education was merely a consequence of a free society.<p>How can someone look at OpenCourseware, free textbooks, and the self-organizing study groups surrounding the former two and not conclude that education is more available than ever before?  Up until WW2, going to college was an unlikely occurrence for the child of parents who had not themselves gone.  Was the ""American Century"" really the result of upper middle class education alone?  It was not until the GI bill that college became an odd expectation.<p>The underlying logical fallacy in Krugman's piece is that attending college is the only form of ""higher"" education available or even desirable.  Shouldn't we instead be asking why lower socio-economic status Americans seem to have adopted an anti-learning cultural bias?  Why, as Dean Kamen asks, do we not celebrate society's engineering achievements?  It's thinkers?

It's a classic case of simplistic, Philistine shotgun approaches.<p>His disdainful view of the value of rhetoric and vicious hostility to the achievements of high culture, or the use of language in artistic ways to express in more aesthetically appealing ways thoughts that can be expressed more ""simply"" toward largely semantically equivalent ends (from an empirical perspective, anyway) also rubs me the wrong way.<p>I mean, sure, saying something as tersely as possible is often valuable and a good lesson to teach.  It is also often the wrong thing to do or, more likely than being flat-out wrong it simply has costs as well as benefits.  What precisely those are depends on what you're trying to achieve with your writing.<p>Should one take Dr. Covington's suggestions when writing a novel, an interesting anecdote, or a persuasive expository essay, even if one is otherwise partial to the goals of clarity in the thinking and writing that goes into it?  Do most writers we consider interesting, compelling, thought-provoking, intriguing, entertaining, etc. follow his stylistic suggestions?  Would their writing conserve those essential qualities if they did?<p>In short, while his objectives may be good lessons for people that write in unclear, logically incoherent or circumlocutory ways, he seems to tend toward very extreme reductions.

875295,comment,874902,875168,0,0,btilly,,,"Please do not confuse efficiency of directing money with being able to realistically address the problem.<p>I grant that well-run charities are much more efficient than government.  However not nearly enough money is voluntarily donated to charity to realistically address the problems that exist.  Based on <a href=""http://www.givingusa.org/press_releases/releases/20080622.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.givingusa.org/press_releases/releases/20080622.ht...</a> we collectively donate about $300 billion per year.  That's about $1000 per year per person.<p>But to bring up one example, about 1% of the population gets schizophrenia, and about a third of those we do not have effective treatment for.  In a country with 300 million people that's about a million people with an untreatable mental illness that is very expensive to deal with.  At a minimum that would take 10-20% of the total available for charity for a cause most people haven't even <i>heard</i> of.  Once you take out all of the money donated to causes donators care about - such as museums, cancer research, third world poverty, and a million splinter causes (such as the Electronic Freedom Foundation), there simply isn't enough left to address a lot of very real and expensive needs.<p>Moving on let's look at your claims about education.  I won't disagree with any of your criticisms.  I've said the same and worse before.  However I'm aware of one fact that you are probably not.  Which is that, after controlling for parent's socioeconomic status, students who go to public schools in the USA do <i>better</i> on tests measuring their academic performance than students who go to private schools.  (If you don't control for the large correlation with parent's socioeconomic status, public schools come out worse.)  So as bad as the public option is, the private one seems to be worse!<p>Not to mention that the big problem the public option solves is delivering education to those who are poor enough to not afford it for themselves.  Not doing that would limit how much of an educated workforce was available in the future, to the detriment of everyone.<p>But why does private education deliver a worse product?  Part of the problem is that parents aren't as good of judges of the quality of their children's education as they think they are.  So private schools are incented to do things that make parents think they are doing a good job at the cost of actually doing a good job.<p>Incidentally education isn't the greatest illustration of the problem.  Public health provides much better ones.  For instance patrons of a restaurant are not in a position to judge whether sanitary procedures are being followed in the kitchen.  Residents are unable to judge how good the water they receive is.  Which is why public health was one of the first areas where economists came to understand why the invisible hand of the market didn't do a good job of provisioning the need.",1255295765

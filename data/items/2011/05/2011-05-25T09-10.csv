Also making and eating breakfast takes for me at least 30 minutes at the moment.<p>Three years ago I had exactly the same 10 minute walk to work and then I did have more time available. However have to consider that:<p>1) Consultant usually works at client's location and client may change often, though I'm a counter-example of that myself. Moving often is not worth it. I consider my current location pretty optimal. A more central location creates more stress and costs way too much. I would believe it's more effective to just decide to work less hours every week for reduced pay but I'm not yet strong enough to commit to it :)<p>2) I do not spend any time travelling to shop, to exercise location or to do fun stuff. My travel time maximum is 2 hours every day - the shops, bars, movies, etc. are along the same route and do not increase time spent travelling in a day at all.<p>3) Car would not improve the situation. In fact it would be slower due to traffic. Or I would have to leave at 06 from home, way too early. And the tradeoff of money to time is ridiculous with so few other uses for a car.

Nobody denies that there's so many other countries that have better results in certain fields on standardized tests as compared to the US. But not only are those tests poor in measuring proficiency in a single subject[1], they are a complete joke if you want to use that to reflect on the education as a whole.<p>Unified curriculum is the problem itself. Although it's not very obvious as of right now I think we'll see a HUGE decentralization in how the education works. I won't be surprised if in 20-30 years the whole primary-middle-high school system will get redefined.<p>You can also rant about the universities in the US, but they are still the best in the world. There are no more than 5-10 universities in other countries that could compare to the top US institutions.<p>Generally speaking I think it's a nonsense to compare average quality institutions at all. It's a contest of who is least bad. Compare the best. It's not hard for Europeans to have slightly better public education if private is very limited in it's operations.<p>[1]The problem with international standardized tests is that the way subjects are thought differs between each country. And it happens that US schools usually have a very different approach to teaching subjects like math as compared to the rest of the world. I can easily see how those tests are skewed against the US.",1306316693

Still 6-7 times a week is fine counting the occasional extra walk back from shop.

An excursion to plead for patience on the part of the reader should only come when the beginning of the sentence is likely to irritate people. The words ""The Case"" aren't going to annoy readers, so pleading for people to please hear the author out is annoying. THAT is the problem with the title. Not the presence of an excursion or parenthetical remark, but the presence of an annoying and meaningless excursion manufactured to make the author seem witty. And so it is with the rest of the post, the excursions are all so blatantly manufactured and artificial, it is impossible to hold them up as examples of why the em dash is a bad idea.<p>To me, the article demonstrates why conceits are a bad idea.

JPEG-2000 seems to have the same issue to a lesser degree. If Mozilla can bring some automated metrics to bear on this (and any parallel JPEG improvements), and metrics seems to be one of your/their strengths, then I'd be very happy, since it seems the JPEG-XR and 2000 teams may have been misled by their own metrics.

This is a market where they want it all to 'just work', and you'll end up dealing with some really really demanding people.<p>And you also risk an established player deciding to extract out their reformatting tool as a stand-alone product and leveraging their existing sales network to block you.<p>Which is why I was suggesting OEMing it to CRM developers, which would let you side-step companies like Daxtra. If the recruitment agency isn't doing enough business to afford to get Adapt or whatever, then they're either just starting up (and will drop you for an integrated solution as they grow) or about to fail.<p>Edit: just looked at your profile, and I'm pretty sure you'll know all about Daxtra. :o) If Volt aren't using it already, ask your account manage for a demo of reformatter, and keep in mind that Daxtra could turn that into a stand-alone SaaS offering pretty easily.",1306314661

The ""stealing"" metaphor seems to have led to the unintended consequence that people are confused by what ""copyright infringement"" even means, thinking that maybe it only applies to something like plagiarism--- ""stealing"" a work by claiming that it's yours when it was actually made by someone else.<p>So the solution is to still post the video, but with a confusing disclaimer like, ""this video isn't mine, all music belongs to [artist], no copyright infringement intended"". Saying ""no copyright infringement intended"" <i>while still uploading the video</i> is strange thing to be doing, unless you have a nonstandard understanding of what copyright infringement means.",1306314657

So the standard isn't truth, it's honesty.<p>It's very hard to prove a journalist is being deliberately misleading. So it's only been used in the case of Holocaust deniers and even then the Supreme Court ruled that the law was not compatible with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The government has shifted the false news law to being a regulatory requirement for broadcasters, but it's unclear whether this isn't still unconstitutional.<p>FOX News, in my estimation, does seem to cross the line when it comes to repeating statements they know (or should know) to be false, often over the course of several days. So I can see why they want even the regulation withdrawn.<p>More details: <a href=""http://openmedia.ca/blog/false-news-and-crtc-who-asked-what-when-and-why"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openmedia.ca/blog/false-news-and-crtc-who-asked-what-...</a>",1306314270

It'll be blocky, but much less blocky than just reducing the JPEG compression level for the same fize size reduction at the low end.<p>I believe WebM does (or at least the format can do) this automatically in low bitrate situations, without the external user needing to understand what's happening on the encode or decode end. I don't know if WebP inherits this trick and that explains it's low bitrate performance or if it's just better in other ways.",1306314253

All this will serve to accomplish is give the summit an air of legitimacy[]</i><p>I think this is debatable.  It depends on how the summit is eventually presented by mainstream media.  If they say there's EFF co-founder, and the panel concluded that we should lock this IP leak machine that is the Internet, then Cory and you are right.<p>But I've already heard news on the radio (France culture, in France) which talked a good deal about freedom, and let speak a spokesman from LQDN.  So there's a good chance that the actual report from a good deal of the mainstream media is that the industries said one thing, and the EFF said another.  They may even report that the EFF said the e-G8 is something the EFFdoesn't approve of.  In that case, Cory and you would be mistaken.<p>In the end, however we probably need both.  Someone who won't go to avoid legitimizing this farce, and another one who go take the heat to secure a minimum media coverage for dissent.",1306314120

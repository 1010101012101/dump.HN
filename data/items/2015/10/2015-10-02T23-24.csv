(The rest is more or less a mess right now.)<p>Coming from Slovenia, that&#x27;s what kindergarten is <i>supposed to be</i>. The word literally means &quot;children&#x27;s garden&quot; and has nothing to do with school.<p>To quote wikipedia &quot;literally children&#x27;s garden, is a preschool educational approach traditionally based on playing, singing, practical activities such as drawing, and social interaction as part of the transition from home to school.&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know what happened in the anglophone world that turned this joyful concept into school. My girlfriend grew up in the US and considers &quot;kindergarten&quot; to be the beginning of school school where they start by teaching you how to read&write. Wikipedia seems to confirm this notion.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just semantics and word-meaning drift.",1443830344

Debugging can be hard but at least it is tractable - you start with the effect and slowly work your way towards the cause. But anticipating which of the changes in environment (including but not limited to: sudden spikes in traffic, changes in statistical distribution of data, subtle partial hardware failures, peculiarities of the systems software etc.) will result in failures is impossible. What is the worst is that all causes can be relatively benign when taken in isolation but when they are all present they interact in some devilish way resulting in a total breakdown of your service.

This is (in my experience) based on PISA. Indeed, much of what I&#x27;ve read coming out of the US is that students must get more &#x27;academic&#x27; education, backed by large-scale testing, in order to compete against the countries with high PISA scores.<p>You use the term &#x27;do not really believe Norwegian results are that much different&#x27;. Could you explain the basis for that statement? The thesis is that a (near) monoculture is a reasonable explanation for high PISA scores. The example of Norway was to show there isn&#x27;t a simple, direct correlation.<p>I don&#x27;t think you don&#x27;t believe the scores aren&#x27;t difference. Instead, your objection seems instead to be that PISA isn&#x27;t a stable/useful metric in the first place, so that comparisons aren&#x27;t relevant. I think your suggestion is that there simply isn&#x27;t data one way or the other on how homogeneity affects education.<p>Which means, I think, that you also disagree with andyl&#x27;s hypothesis, but for different reasons.",1443829852

In reality, if a teacher is bad, there is precious little the principal can do about it in Finland. Almost all teachers are fortunately good, but I have met a couple who were completely hopeless. The schools absolutely couldn&#x27;t get rid of them once they had been hired to permanent positions.<p>Personal experience (Finland): my grade 3-6 teacher was himself the principal in a two-teacher school, an electrician by profession, and had been quick-trained to take a teacher&#x27;s job after being discharged from the army at the end of the War - no master&#x27;s degree, no degree from any university. He actually did close-order drill for PE. And if I was unruly, he hit me in the head.<p>Yes, teachers are better trained nowadays (what I describe was 1970&#x27;s and the man retired in 1980&#x27;s).",1443829804

That&#x27;s not a bug, it&#x27;s a feature. The whole political philosophy of the US is that <i>no one person</i> gets power that somebody else can&#x27;t block.<p>> Could the entire problem not be solved by removing the entire &quot;checks-and-balances&quot; concept, and simply hold presidents accountable for their actions (or lack thereof when it comes to promises)?<p>The thing you see as a problem could be solved that way, yes.

It needs to be a gene that has an impact on alcoholism, but the thing being selected for could be something else entirely. Consider sickle-cell anemia. If you just look at it as the &quot;sickle-cell anemia gene&quot; you&#x27;ll boggle at how it spread as far as it did, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s also the &quot;malaria-resistance gene&quot;.

This example, doesn&#x27;t even account for the variety involved with &quot;traditional food&quot;, which only increases the stochastic nature of its nutritional properties.<p>Having defined that (hopefully we agree on the axioms), we can continue on to discuss the nature of problems where &quot;we don&#x27;t know [what] we need&quot;. Until we know what we need, the optimal strategy to satisfy an unknown goal is through non-determinism (again, hopefully we agree).<p>Based on the above:<p>I&#x27;ll try to make a more succinct argument:<p>Given that Soylent contains everything we know we need.<p>And we know we don&#x27;t know everything we need.<p>Then only consuming Soylent guarantees we do not satisfy all of our needs.<p>We must then consume things we do not know, to increase the probability of satisfying all our needs.<p>P.S. I am all for scientific experiments to better determine the unknowns and turn them into knowns. However, as long as there are any unknowns, the above points still hold.",1443829303

They are also, by policy, the main driving force and final say on curriculums and educational program design.

You have individuals that are voted into political positions under certain &quot;promises&quot;, and then have access to a myriad of excuses that they claim prevented them from implementing said promises. Of course, I understand that sometimes there really are stumbling blocks and active measures preventing a plan from being implemented. But can we not draw a line somewhere? And hold political figures accountable for at least trying to implement their promises. Or at least require them to present sound reasons or studies for actually wanting to enact something as law. E.g. &quot;Study on effects of UBI on the well-being of single-parent households&quot;<p>Additionally, I&#x27;m a tad confused about this concept of Democracy (warning, not really confused, just arguing): If the president is elected in a presidential election and represents the majority of the people, why then do we elect a separate set (branch, as they call it), of individuals at a more granular level that could very well &quot;fight&quot; the already-elected president? I&#x27;m referring to the congress/senators there. Could the entire problem not be solved by removing the entire &quot;checks-and-balances&quot; concept, and simply hold presidents accountable for their actions (or lack thereof when it comes to promises)? And by accountable, I mean real consequences: prison/large-fines.<p>Following from that, we don&#x27;t all believe that we could potentially get a &quot;crazy&quot; or &quot;rogue&quot; president that abuses his power after election? E.g. creating some sort of police-state, starting wars that the public doesn&#x27;t want or rewriting constitutional-law?

They are rather large, indeed.<p>But like I said, hardware-wise, they haven&#x27;t given me much trouble (except for a power supply with very slight fault, causing it to make kind of chirping noise every once in a while - it drove our accountants <i>crazy</i> - our field service guy tried replacing the hard drive, the heater, and some other thing (I forget which one), before finding the faulty part). Also, trying to print on paper that is just ever so slightly <i>wet</i> can be... interesting, if one happens to need to print out some one hundred pages. <i>sigh</i><p>A couple of years back, when I was still working as a programmer, I was once given the task to write code controlling a specialized printer, the kind used in factories for printing bar codes on things. The printer used a continuous stream of ink that normally went into a tube feeding it back to the ink tank. The ink contained tiny iron particles and went through a magnet that could direct it to the position it should land.<p>When powering off the printer, the software controlling it had to make sure to first send the command to move the ink-catching tube right up to the nozzle before shutting down the pump, or else the printer would ... kind of soil itself. ;-)<p>Of course, the first time I tried to actually print something with that printer, I forgot to shut down the printer properly, and it soiled itself in a big way. Specifically, the stream of ink went through a teeny-tiny hole in a small diamond platelet; when I shut down the printer impromperly, ink stuck to that platelet and dried up, so that tiny little hole was no longer perfectly circular. As a result, whenever I tried to print something, the machine would soil itself some more.<p>After talking to the manufacturer&#x27;s customer support repeatedly (in their defence, they were friendly, helpful and competent), a support technician told me to remove the platelet from the printer and put it in a bath of MEK (industrial-strength solvent) over the weekend to dissolve the dried remnants of ink (after I had cleaned that platelet manually several times).<p>The solvent was fairly volatile <i>and</i> highly flammable, so I put it in a small jar, dropped the platelet in the jar and screwed the top on as tightly as I could.<p>When I came back on Monday, the platelet was indeed clean and gave me no trouble whatsoever after that. The plastic coating covering the inside of the jar&#x27;s top, however, had &quot;molten&quot; almost completely.",1443827915

So if you think it’s the war on drugs, you might think, ‘OK, if we just decriminalize drugs, that will solve the problem.’ And, you know, it’s true that if we shift away from punishment to treatment that could be a huge improvement. But just letting people out of prison—decarcerating drug offenders—will not reduce the prison population by as much as people think. If you released every person in prison on a drug charge today, our state prison population would drop from about 1.5 million to 1.2 million. So we’d still be the world’s largest incarcerating country; we’d still have an enormous prison population.<p>And if we focused on cutting back sentence lengths, maybe that would weaken DAs’ bargaining power at plea bargaining, but since people aren’t serving the massively long sentences anyway, it probably won’t have that big an effect on prison population either.&quot;<p>This is a weird argument, because reducing the prison population by 17% <i>is a significant dent</i> ..",1443827258

10321856,comment,10319138,10321191,0,0,lisa_henderson,,,"At any scale, you use what is convenient to your goals. Think about maps. If you want to hike a mountain in Colorado, you might go with a topological map where 1 centimeter equals 2 meters. If you&#x27;d like to hike the Appalachian Trail, you might want a map where 1 centimeter equals 50 meters. If you want to drive around New York, you might want a good street map where 1 centimeter equals 200 meters. If you are teaching the history of World War II, and you are focused on the Normandy invasion, you might want a map where 1 centimeter equals 500 meters. If you are teaching world history and you want 1 map of the world, you might want a map where 1 centimeter equals 100 kilometers.<p>What details you leave off the map, at each scale, is always a hotly contested issue. You could create a world map with the same level of detail as your topological map of the Colorado mountain: 1 centimeter equals 2 meters. However, the map would be too huge to work with, and it would contain too much detail. You remove detail to keep the map convenient to work with, but it must always be convenient to the task that you are working on. You will get yourself into trouble if you work with too large or too small a scale. I remember when I was young, I was often frustrated with the high-level maps we used in history classes, as the scale was often too high for me to understand what was actually going on. I recall seeing the map of the 30 Year War, a bunch of big red and yellow and blue arrows invading different parts of Europe, and it really told me nothing at all about what happened during the war.",1443827162

We thought about using statement_timeout, but we didn&#x27;t like the lack of flexibility when we <i>do</i> have long-running queries that aren&#x27;t necessarily deleterious to performance. Instead we opted to use two different users (&quot;cron&quot; for long running jobs, and a normal read/write user pair for normal) that the long query killer script will kill at different timeouts, effectively implementing a per-user timeout rather than a global timeout.<p>I bet the best approach might be to have the statement_timeout be the largest of all of your per-user timeouts (in case your watchdog script fails, can&#x27;t connect, etc. for whatever reason).",1443827141

Right now I have several erlang nodes that are doing a few hundred thousand http connections concurrently.  Looking at the logs, it looks like about 10-20 of those concurrent processes are dying every second for various reasons (upstream crappiness, network errors, parse errors, sunspots for all I know right now), and are getting resurrected by their supervisors.  Every blue moon, an entire network target will go out and the restart frequency will be too high, and the supervisors themselves will commit suicide and be restarted by their supervisors.<p>Sometimes a machine will go down and come back up.  Looks like the one I&#x27;m on has an uptime of about 90 days, which seems low, but doesn&#x27;t really matter.  If too many of them go down at the same time, I&#x27;m notified.

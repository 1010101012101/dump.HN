I do understand why Samsung stopped supporting it after Android 2.3 though. The phone&#x27;s specs just can&#x27;t keep up. I can say the same thing about an iPhone 3GS that I&#x27;ve got lying around.<p>Now I have a Nexus 4 and I can say that the best Android to get is always the latest Nexus - good hardware specs at a good price and it&#x27;s the reference. Even if Google stops supporting it, heck, if CyanogenMod still supports the first-gen Galaxy S, then you can bet that it will work on a reference Nexus phone for a long time.",1389650399

One neat thing about Nest is that they are doing what many products failed to do before, and \nthat&#x27;s to kind of become a platform for the &quot;internet of things.&quot;  It&#x27;s a thermostat and smoke detector now, but it could easily \nsoon become more stuff, sensors and actuators, and it could easily all work together toward enabling a smarter home.  Yes if you are \na hardware/microcontroller geek you can get the same functionality for $100 but you will spend 100 hours on it and it will look \nvastly inferior to the Nest designs.  It is also amazing how much more successful it could be than the \nmillion crappy little X10 and zigbee gadgets with their 1960s UX.<p>Another amazing thing to me is how well and how fast they managed to build prominent industry relationships: you can get rebates \nfrom the electric company, they are on Home Depot and Lowes shelves, advertised on NPR, etc.",1389650333

So perhaps they also spent their money developing a cheaper version after proving that people like it and more importantly proving it can save money and eventually pay for itself.<p>I would spend a ton of money putting everything on one chip, getting the cost down to $5 or $10 for the same user experience.  Maybe put in a cheaper display if needed.  Now this wireless device in the house can pay itself off in very short amount of time, making it a super easy decision for consumers.  The current offerings of thermostats are clunky and have horrible user interfaces that require modes and buttons and such to program.. forget about daylight savings time!<p>If people can buy Nest functionality for $50 then google will have a solid foothold in people&#x27;s homes.  From that they can sell camera&#x27;s that show up through your google TV device and get into the security market.<p>The dial on Nest is a universal interface, as the original ipod has shown us, perfect for scrolling through menu&#x27;s and long lists and for changing volume or choosing music.  Might as well put a microphone in so people can ask the internet things.<p>Still not quite sure it&#x27;s worth $3.2Billion.. perhaps there was a bidding war?",1389650328

Saving money is a sort of minimum expectation. The thing that Nest delivers that the competitors don&#x27;t is ease of use. The previous 3M and Honeywell thermostats I owned before were not cheap, but their displays were terrible and their UX was the stuff of nightmares.<p>It took me probably 10 minutes to setup the Nest by comparison and maintenance has been mostly hands-off. It&#x27;ll tweak the schedule here and there as necessary.<p><i>THAT</i> is the value proposition. To throw out the Indiglo monstrosities before it that were inevitably running on some awful schedule because they were too much trouble and came with 50 page instruction manuals in 5 different languages.<p>I don&#x27;t have time for that.<p>So to me, that&#x27;s why Nest is successful. It might also explain why their smoke detectors are meh to me.

For those systems that required fine grained data (like Peru, I believe), our design was to give them secure one way hashes to use on the data before giving it to us so that we never had any info, just something we could key on (we would then proxy api calls to do the actual national id lookups or something so again, we never saw the id&#x27;s)\nAFAIK, none of these ever panned out for other reasons.<p>At least when I was running it (and i doubt things have changed in the past 8 months, it&#x27;s the same people other than me), there was a zero percent chance we would have ever agreed to <i>receive</i> any &quot;vital data&quot; at all.<p>I haven&#x27;t looked heavily into all this, but I have <i>very</i> strong doubts any info about people would have actually been asked for or given.   You know how the press tends to understand nuanced technical detail.<p>In most cases where these stories happen, sad truth is the real reason is losing control of voter suppression.",1389649959

On one other side, they need to somehow &quot;add value&quot; to the Android experience, either through software (i.e. &quot;extras&quot; or &quot;rethinks&quot;) or through hardware (in which they have plenty of competition) or, at best, finding overlooked combinations of the two that they can provide (e.g. a power button that&#x27;s also an IR remote for your TV.)<p>They don&#x27;t have a truly stable platform on which to add these improvements. In many cases the platform will beat them to whatever it is they want to add, and they won&#x27;t have anything &quot;new&quot; to promote as their own.<p>As (or if) Android matures gets closer to the point where each new version matters less than the last, then they&#x27;ll eventually have something like a stable platform to further focus their efforts on making the smartphone they want to make. It all depends on how much their users care about new Android.<p>I don&#x27;t have any armchair advice this decision, but it&#x27;s interesting to consider the trade-offs they&#x27;re making.<p>Disclosure: I used to work for HTC.",1389649817

However, it made me a better programmer, because it forced me to think about design and data structures first, then about the code.<p>Let me be clear: I think it&#x27;s a great way to test students as long as the graders/instructors aren&#x27;t overly anal about syntax or even API correctness.  I was lucky to have teachers who were okay with unbalanced parentheses, made-up API functions, and  in upper-division classes, pseudo code was even acceptable (data structures). (However  most CS classes will be biased towards imperative programming over functional programming).<p>To use a cooking analogy, if you have to think about how you are cutting the fish, you won&#x27;t be able to think about how you are going to prepare or cook the fish.

Until late 2012 or early 2013, the fee for computers and tablets was only 4% fee, making a total of 7% after Paypal.<p>What some don&#x27;t realize is that these rates are still available--for $16/month. When selling a computer or tablet for anything over $270, it&#x27;s actually less costly to pay for an Ebay Store account for a month and pay a total fee of 7% + $16 rather than 13%. It&#x27;s an easy option, but it&#x27;s not at all obvious to those who aren&#x27;t in-the-know. I&#x27;d be curious to know how many people sell computers on Ebay for >$1000 and pay the full 10% fee--I would expect it&#x27;s a small number.<p>So if you weren&#x27;t familiar with Ebay but a friend gave you the tip to sell your $1000 computer with an Ebay Store, you&#x27;d end up with $64 more dollars from your sale than you would with Fobo--$914 instead of $850.<p>I appreciate that Fobo makes understanding costs easier, but that&#x27;s not very helpful when those easy-to-understand costs are still higher than the extortionate, only-paid-by-those-who-didn&#x27;t-read-their-selling-options costs from Ebay. I think a more competitive pricing strategy would reflect the true base price on eBay, plus a small premium for the convenience of not having to research it.<p>Perhaps there&#x27;s justification for that level of a premium, and Ebay&#x27;s choice to horribly obfuscate pricing has made it seem even more reasonable to those who aren&#x27;t familiar with Ebay&#x27;s pricing. However, I still don&#x27;t think that makes Fobo particularly cost-competitive or a particularly good value unless the service can bring a huge audience to the auction.",1389648749

7053473,comment,7052593,7052593,10,0,swisspol,,,"Impressive write up. I agree your reasoning almost 100% but not with a few hypothesis you make and that changes the overall conclusion:<p>1) IMO you can&#x27;t apply such &quot;idealized&quot; reasoning to an early stage consumer startup: the vast majority run at a loss. It&#x27;s expected and as a matter of fact not a single investor had problems with our financials. For better or worse, Everpix was on the VC track, not the bootstrap track.<p>2) You&#x27;re essentially assuming that infrastructure costs are set in stone. I addressed this point in another comment: <a href""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=704355"" rel""nofollo"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7043555</a>.<p>3) You&#x27;re assuming photo collection sizes are also constant, which is not the case: early adopters will have more photos than mass consumers. For instance IIRC average subscriber had 15K photos, while we would expect the average consumer to have 5-10K. This gets compounded with infrastructure cost savings.<p>4) You&#x27;re assuming the only revenue stream are subscriptions. We had concrete plans post Series A of printing based monetization leveraging the uniqueness of our photo platform.<p>So what you demonstrated is that, assuming some hypotheses, it would be really difficult to run profitably such a business on AWS. Again, I agree with you: none of the large players do it on AWS (I know for a fact and that savings would be 3X-8X), and our #1 engineering goal post Series A would been to get off AWS (since we would have had the capital and resources to do so).<p>I would however counter that using a different set of hypotheses, more appropriate to such a business, combined with our &quot;track record&quot; of driving infrastructure costs down, we would have fixed that marginal loss short-term. I am actually 99% sure of that but of course I cannot prove it :)<p>On a side note, some questions which IMO are more critical to address are for instance what&#x27;s the total size of the market or how much does it cost to acquire customers at scale? Now these are externalities you cannot &quot;change&quot; contrary to infrastructure costs. So if these don&#x27;t work out, then your business can absolutely not be viable. I would love to read blog posts as detailed as yours on such topics.<p>Thanks again for writing this insightful post!<p>PS 1: About infrastructure costs, I shared some extra context here: <a href""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=704164"" rel""nofollo"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7041640</a><p>PS 2: About the team size, Android & Windows were actually outsourced to contractors. Regarding the rest, we&#x27;re going to have to disagree that a quality and complex product like Everpix can be built with a smaller or less experience team in such a time frame (for instance, you&#x27;re ignoring the science part and I assure you no junior iOS dev can built highly responsive and dynamic apps displaying 20,000 photos) ;)",1389648401

When instead, as is usually the case, the anonymity is that of a well-heeled lobbyist for a wealthy industry, who has his arms run up 27 other reporters&#x27; asses in addition to this one&#x27;s, anonymity only serves corrupt purposes.

After college, it becomes socially unacceptable to initiate conversation with a person you don&#x27;t know. People are not only stratified vertically by socioeconomic status, but horizontally by industry- and subculture-specific senses of superiority (academics vs. &quot;techies&quot; vs. bankers).<p>A coffee house would have to work at it to recreate the old dynamic: hold board game tournaments, have common viewing of intelligent television (when it&#x27;s on, which is rarely). But that would conflict with the business goal (except in college towns) of getting people in and out reasonably quickly so you can afford rent on the space.

For example, if you want to write a dynamic implementation for some parametrically polymorphic code there must be a way to check at runtime that the dynamic implementation is respecting the type that you assigned to it (there are ways to do that but they are all very tricky).<p>The list of tricky things also grows very quickly once you put some though into it. You mentioned return type polymorphism but there are also many other things that are hard to check dynamically (record field names) and lots of things that dynamic codes likes to do (like mutability and subtyping) that force extra complexity into the static type system or that can be used to subvert the static types if you are not careful.",1389647095

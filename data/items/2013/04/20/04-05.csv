I think in the end, your neurochemistry needs to be changed in order for the therapy to have an effect. But using drugs are not the only way to change your neurochemistry. In short, I don't think he is suggesting that the author of the article to use willpower. He simply suggests that maybe he can try some psychotherapy.",1366433982

That people who advocate for a system that tries to save the most lives possible are sociopaths? <i>What?</i><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like you're saying that adhering to some arbitrary societal standard of behavior in the face of tragedy is more important than, you know, saving lives.",1366433934

When I was younger, we didn't have cellphones and the numerous electronic related items that cause you to lose focus. Try eliminating everything but the necessities, and then focusing on one thing at a time. Even if you get distracted, set a goal of going back to it even if it is for a very short amount of time. Just like a tree, keep chipping away at it, and eventually you will make it fall. You can go for medication, however, they can cause dependency, and can cause more issues in the long run.",1366433912
5580315,comment,5579988,5580248,8,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"So what's the ""public safety exception"" about then?<p>We're starting from the position that, absent a public safety concern, the defendant's right to know his rights is greater than the law enforcement interest in not encouraging the defendant to exercise them, and if the cops don't read the Miranda rights then the statements aren't admissible.<p>Now throw in a public safety issue -- the cops have to interrogate this guy or some people could get hurt. Why does that change the result? If the public safety issue is more important than reading the defendant his rights, then it's also more important than allowing the police to use the defendant's statements in court, since we've already decided as between those things which is more important. So the consistent outcome should be for the cops to interrogate the defendant and resolve the public safety issue, but for them not to be able to use any of those statements in court.<p>Is there some non-obvious reason for it to not work that way?",1366433890

After getting treatment for ADD I am much happier and productive at school and work. In general, I'm less stressed as well.<p>A therapist almost diagnosed me a couple years ago but I was biased against the idea of accepting that I had ADD. Of course, now I realize how much wasted time, money, and effort I might have saved if I had been willing to seek treatment the first time a psychologist suggested it to me. Counseling and medication have all been very helpful.<p>It's tough because it isn't well understood and the public has many wrong and negative impressions of ADD/ADHD. One of the toughest is of course that many people don't think it is real. However, personally, after a year of treatment looking at my life before and after being treated for ADD, it is clear that treatment worked for me. That really dispels that notion for me. If it walks like a duck and quacks like duck... My university also had a lot of great resources to help learn about ADD so check in with them as well.",1366433870

5580297,comment,5580033,5580033,7,0,csallen,,,"This post is wrong on so many levels.<p>First, it's irrelevant whether deaths occur on accident or on purpose. What matters is preventing death and suffering. Let's say I gave you a large sum of money, and somehow proved it could prevent 1000 accidental deaths/year or 10 murders/year. How could you morally justify choosing to prevent the murders over the accidents? What makes up for those 990 lives lost?<p>Second, the ""message"" we sent via our response to this situation was anything <i>but</i> good. We essentially showed terrorists how to easily cause $billions in damage to our economy and effectively publicize their message to the globe. On top of that, we've proven our inability to prevent and defend against poorly-executed attacks in crowded locations, and our difficulty in apprehending injured teenage suspects traveling on foot. Great. If I were a terrorist, I'd be drawing up plans to bomb shopping malls and little league football games.<p>Third, you don't fully comprehend the inefficiency with which money and attention are currently being spent. Accidental deaths are not unavoidable. With additional research and attention focused in the right direction, we can prevent <i>far</i> more deaths due to accident and disease than we do currently. We stand to save tens of thousands of lives per year.<p>But that would be boring.<p>People don't care about run-of-the-mill deaths. They aren't  exciting, they aren't captivating, and the media knows this well. The average Joe cares more about watching a firefight and ""sending a message"" than he cares about saving lives or reducing human suffering. And that's a damn shame.",1366433572

5580207,comment,5562156,5574591,2,0,dgreensp,,,"Consciousness and intelligence:  You're right that proving something is ""conscious"" does seem difficult or impossible.  Making something that is merely ""intelligent,"" on the other hand, may be easy, depending on how you define the word.  I think that's because consciousness is something we experience in ourselves, looking inwards, marveling at what it means that we are a mind living in a body, while intelligence is something we ascribe to other things in varying degrees if they exhibit certain behaviors.  It follows that for us to consider something else to be conscious, we have to have that same feeling as when we experience our own consciousness, but via identification with something else (a robot or AI).  We have to be like, ""Wow, consciousness,"" and then be like, ""Oh, that's not me, that's him!""  It's the same way for intelligence, but it's a much broader term because there are many kinds of intelligence.  Animals exhibit a lot of intelligence, as do some computer systems.  In both cases (consciousness and intelligence), I think making systems that we recognize as more intelligent and more conscious involves understanding the brain and replicating its various functionality (since it's brains that will be making the call; it's brains that encode the distinction; the rest of the universe doesn't care).  As we learn more about consciousness, we may be able to identify it as a particular kind of intelligence.  For example, it may basically be the small part of our brain that directs our attention and awareness from moment to moment and decides what computational tasks to take on, while the rest of the brain is basically a large set of elaborate coprocessors specialized for different types of computation.<p>Simulated universes:  I still think this is all meaningless metaphor.  It's not easy to articulate why, but I'll try.<p>Some lines of thought just combine ideas in deep ways, but don't actually tell you anything new.  For example, Zeno's paradox -- to get from point A to point B, you have to first go halfway, then halfway again, and so on forever -- doesn't actually teach us that nothing can ever go from point A to point B.  It just demonstrates a glitch in the metaphors we use to reason about time and space.  Actually, it's a glitch in the metaphor of traversing space as achieving a goal.  Normally, if reaching a particular goal involves an infinite to-do list of subgoals, we wouldn't expect to ever get to the end and actually achieve the goal.  However, if the goal is traversing some infinitely subdividable interval of space, we are provided with a mechanism to generate an infinite list of subgoals that are presumably all involved in achieving the larger goal.  It's all just mental gymnastics and the normal tools of intuition breaking down.<p>To take a closer example, consider this line of thinking:  ""If you pick a random marriage proposal, chances are it is an imagined one rather than an actual one, because for every actual marriage proposal there are on average two or more imagined ones that never came to pass.""  This strange kind of thinking also mashes together diverse intuitive concepts.  There's the idea that every class of thing (like ""marriage proposal"") has an extension set, an ensemble of instances.  There's the fiction that an ""event"" is a discrete thing that we could identify and count if we had to, like counting the number of thoughts I've had today (""a thought"" is a singular noun after all).  There's the concept from probability theory of picking a member at random from a set (with the presumption that this is a well-defined act).  There's the idea that an imagined X is still an X, because we still call it one.  Unicorns are still unicorns even if they don't happen to exist.<p>The most intellectual, abstract part of the brain has a tendency to focus on <i>what could possibly be</i> rather than what is.  We can get so wrapped up in generalities that we forget that <i>this</i> is the universe -- what we see around us, not what we imagine or are capable of conceiving of.  Statements like, ""Perhaps everything that can exist does exist"" sound to me like a projection of our own models of reality out onto reality.  Similarly, it's fascinating that we can conceptualize and talk about infinite computing power, but that doesn't mean there is any reality to it.",1366432090

It only acquires relevance if the government seeks to have the statements admitted at trial.<p>Discussing the similar case of Faisal Shahzad, who attempted to bomb Times Square, Orin Kerr, a law professor who is an expert on the 4th Amendment wrote:<p>""Importantly, though, it would not have violated Shahzads constitutional rights to not read him his Miranda rights. A lot of people assume that the police are required to read a suspect his rights when he is arrested. That is, they assume that one of a persons rights is the right to be read their rights. It often happens that way on Law & Order, but thats not what the law actually requires. Under Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U.S. 760 (2003), it is lawful for the police to not read a suspect his Miranda rights, interrogate him, and then obtain a statement that would be inadmissible in court. Chavez holds that a persons constitutional rights are violated only if the prosecution tries to have the statement admitted in court. See id. at 772-73. Indeed, the prosecution is even allowed to admit any physical evidence discovered as a fruit of the statement obtained in violation of Miranda  only the actual statement is excluded. See United States v. Patane, 542 U.S. 630 (2004). So while it may sound weird, it turns out that obtaining a statement outside Miranda but not admitting it in court is lawful.""<p>Oops, link: <a href=""http://www.volokh.com/2010/05/05/shahzad-and-miranda-rights/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.volokh.com/2010/05/05/shahzad-and-miranda-rights/</a>",1366431500

For example, people prefer (and enjoy more) colored sound over more neutral reproduction all the time.<p>Not to mention vinyl is also about the cultural experience (connection with the cottage era of the music industry, large cover art, etc), the tactile feel, and even the patina and fragility of the medium (which can even include the crackle). Consumption of art, any art, is not at all about perfect reproduction.<p>><i>But I think that when the deaths of people like Dennis Ritchie and John McCarthy in the same month as Steve are ignored, then the world is suffering from a serious case of myopia</i><p>Steve Job's work was important to the economy and the consumers at large in a manifest way (ie. building the company with the largest quarterly earnings of all time, for one).<p>Ritchie's work, no so much and in a much more roundabout way.

They're not even playing the same sport. Cutting corners in the name of profit has a chance of harming someone, and while it is definitely wrong, there is not even a remote comparison to the actions of demonstrated sociopathic behavior to harm, kill, and decapitate eight-year-olds watching a marathon.<p>I don't really see the distinction here. Active intent vs. passive intent to harm others that means that you known that the actions you are taking will hurt, maim, or kill others and that, one way or another, you are OK with that. To say that passive acceptance of one's actions as leading to the ruining and death of others is not as bad as actively going on and committing murder is silly, either way you are justifying your actions and you had the same end result.<p>> Let's say, for a moment, that Stallman is right, and that the chemical plant owners willfully traded employee safety for money. That's wrong. However, inability to realize that a human being intentionally killing and maiming fellow human beings using explosive devices on the streets of a populated city during a marathon, demonstrating full intent to kill and complete disregard for the free agency of children as young as 8, and blowing people's limbs off on purpose, is the mark of a sociopath.<p>If you willingly traded employee safety for sake of profit and knew that doing so could reasonably hurt or kill others, you have demonstrated an intent to kill and demonstrated complete disregard for the free agency of people. That the tactics differ between someone dropping a bomb in a crowd vs. someone abusing their business and employees doesn't change the reality that both are doing something evil and destructive to society.<p>> You concern me if you present an argument to me along these lines, that we should ""care more"" about the chemical plant or auto accidents on the interstates in a day or ... whatever.<p>The point is that there are common issues in our society that cause greater loss of life and damage compared to less frequent events like bombing a crowd or a mass shooting. That doesn't mean that a bombing isn't bad or that it is less important. However, these kinds of events receive much more attention and coverage compared to those common dangers.<p>> I'm more and more convinced lately that the people in my life who have arguments with me like this, including Richard Stallman, are sociopaths, and I'm sorry. I'm going to make active strides to remove these people from my life, and so should you; the complete disregard of basic social empathy, the understanding of why normal human beings consider the Boston bombings a life-changing event but the chemical plant marginally less so, indicates to me a conscience that is capable of thinking unspeakable things.<p>For some, the chemical plant incident is more of a life-changing event than the Boston bombings. We should have empathy to see this and consider that hearing alternative points of view may provide a richer perspective about how these events affect our lives and the lives of others. If you reject anyone who doesn't agree with you about how important the Boston bombing is, you are saying that you are not interested in empathy in the first place because you are placing your experience and sharing of that experience as more important than others.",1366430473

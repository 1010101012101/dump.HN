987619,comment,987478,987555,0,0,silencio,,,"> I don't own any e-reader or plan to buy one anytime soon, My mac book does a good job...<p>That is basically what I thought (if you replace macbook with iPhone) for the past few years, up until I got a Kindle last week and then fell in love with it. While there is a lot of room for innovation still, I don't see Apple releasing an e-ink based device for a long, long, long time if ever. Apple could release a tablet in the next year, but presumably it will have a display like the iPhone's, and battery life to match. It'll probably be general purpose: good for almost everything, useful for people that need a color display, but it won't really match a Kindle or Nook specifically for reading text and not having to charge for a week at a time.<p>But of course, Amazon has an iPhone app already. They're working on desktop apps now. Presumably an Apple tablet will run 3rd party apps, in which case there will also be a Kindle app for the Apple tablet. Amazon sells books regardless in this situation, which is a win-win. The same goes to Barnes & Noble too. So will the next generation Kindle, Nook, Sony Reader, or Apple tablet truly drive <i>hardware</i> innovation between all the competitors? Not so sure...(although I personally would like to see the keyboard on the Kindle replaced with a touchscreen).",1260438397

That was certainly an oversight on my part - an assembly language should be included.<p>Eight should be enough, after that, you probably wouldn't learn enough to make the effort worthwhile (except maybe to learn a language for a particular need, eg available libraries). I think my number seven then would be an assembly language and my eight would be Oz, ATS[1] and J[2] (not really in the same category, but more of a misc interesting languages category). I would then add Python/Ruby/Boo/Groovy in with C++, C# and Java.<p>ATS and J are both unique in their own ways. I'm not sure what value there is in learning either of these (since I don't know them) but they <i>seem</i> different enough to teach you something new. J (or APL or K) do teach you about array processing languages and point-free programming, so maybe this is useful.

Things don't have to be done that way.  Standard insurance pays by the treatment, but a reasonable contract would pay by the disease.  In my ideal world, I'd be able to walk into Allstate and say,<p>""Hi, I'd like an insurance policy against lung cancer."" \n""Okay.  At your age, health, and risk level, your risk level is X over six months.  We offer a six month contract covering treatment plan A, averaging $Y for $X<i>Y</i>Profit or treatment plan B, averaging $Z for $X<i>Z</i>Profit.""\n""Only six months?  If I'm still sick after six months, my rates go up?""\n""Actually, $Y is the lifetime cost of Plan A.  In the event you are diagnosed with lung cancer, we are contractually obligated to pay for the treatment strategy outlined there for the rest of your life.""\n""Even if I can't keep up with the premiums?""\n""It doesn't work that way.  This is a one time contract designed to mitigate risk over the coming six months; if you fall ill, you have no further obligation to us."" \n""Can I change from Plan A to Plan B after I get sick?"" \n""You can, but it'll cost you $Z - $Y.  At that point, though, it's not really insurance -- more like a financing and payment plan, so the cost is much higher.  You're best off selecting the level of coverage you want in advance, or arranging financing at the time."" \n""So, if I do develop lung cancer, my acute injury contract with you is unaffacted?"" \n""Right.""\n""Or I could even switch to State Farm for that, and you'd still be obligated to pay for lung cancer treatment.""\n""Right, though where synergistic treatements are possible, we offer a significant discount if you buy all your health insurance through us...""<p>This seems to me like the omly mathematically sensible way to do it, and I find it perverse that it's done any other way.  Let alone that the other way is standard practice.  You buy insurance to mitigate risk.  I buy a fire insurance policy that covers the cost of repairs to my house in the event of a fire.  I would never buy a fire insurance policy that covered any repairs to be made within a month of the fire's occurance (after which the company might drop me or my rates might go up), nor would I expect a company to offer ""insurance"" that covered any repairs to be made in the current month as a result of previous fires.  That would be mathematically insane.<p>And yet it is the default case with health insurance.  It mitigates the cost of this month's treatments, not this lifetime's diseases.<p>""So . . . I need to disclose something.  I'm actually shopping for lung cancer insurance because I already have lung cancer, and I can't afford the treatment.""\n""The situation is very different, then, but we can still help you manage the overall cost of treatment.  Plan A costs $Y and Plan B costs $Z, and comes with these options--""\n""Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Those are hundreds of thousands of dollars, and you want it up front?  I can't possibly afford that."" \n""Oh, that's just the total price of the contract.  Our financing department typically offers 15 to 30 year payment plans, with some risk premiums.""\n""Paying for two years of treatment over three decades?  It still looks expensive."" \n""Yes, it's better to have insurance up front, so you can pool risk with others who match your risk profile.  But even after the fact, you can still pay for predictability.  You may have an easy and successful treatment, or you may suffer a costly and prolonged process followed by even a relapse.  The cost to you is $Y either way."" \n""Okay, well, so . . . not only am I uninsured and already sick, I'm also poor and don't really have any assets.   You'd have be crazy to loan me money to cover even the most bare bones treatment plan.  Am I just SOL?""\n""Well . . . <i>we</i> can't do much for you.  At this point, you're not trying to mitigate risk, you're trying to get other people to pay for an already incurred cost.  That's not insurance anymore, that's <i>charity</i>, and we can refer you to St. Joseph's Hospital. . .""<p>If you want to offer universal treatment to the poor, it is a noble charitable goal -- on par with offering universal food or universal education or pursuing world peace.  Establish a fund or program for that purpose and go for it.<p>But leave the people who are buying actual <i>insurance</i> alone!<p>I want a health insurance contract that is portable, customizable, and that does not give me or the insurer or the doctor perverse contractual or treatment incentives.  In particular, I want a plan that actually mitigates the risk I'm trying to mitigate.  I want the cost to be reactive to my personal risk level -- I don't want to pay for anyone else's health care, and I don't want anyone else to pay for mine.  The lung cancer insurance cost should go up if I smoke.  The cost to cover kids against genetic disease should go up if my spouse and I are both cystic fibrosis carriers.  The costs in general should go down if I can pass a bi-annual athletic test.  I want to be able to self-insure at whatever level I think is financially appropriate, and I want to expect to pay cash for routine or elective procedures.  I don't want to be denied vaccination, required to vaccinate, or even vaccinated for free; I want to be offered a $17 tetanus shot in exhange for $4 off my monthly insurance bill.<p>Right now, employment is insurance and health care is partly charity and insurance is partly charity and charity is largely employment.<p>I'd love to live in a world where employment was employment, health care was health care, charity was charity, and insurance was insurance.",1260436110

What they are talking about, is that once we create an AI that can <i>improve its own intelligence</i> in a way that humans <i>can&#x27;t</i>, then the improved intelligence will know how to further improve its own intelligence, and so on.<p>Even if there is a limit to the number of discoveries possible in any field, if you&#x27;re affecting the base rate at which you&#x27;re making new discoveries, you can (potentially) continue making progress.<p>More importantly, all of this is besides the point - it could easily be that all the &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; in improving intelligence can make an intelligence that is vastly more intelligent than a human, at which point the so-called &quot;singularity&quot; will have been reached. Or in the words of the &quot;Intelligence Explosion&quot; camp, we will have reached a world where we are no longer the dominant intelligence, possibly by a very wide gap.<p>I see plenty of reason to think that human intelligence is not a good benchmark for &quot;the maximum intelligence you can get by picking all the low-hanging fruit&quot;, since there are many, many easy improvements we can imagine that will almost certainly improve human intelligence (e.g., perfect memory, ability to partially reprogram yourself to do stuff, like for example not to have &quot;bad&quot; desires like eating unhealthily, etc.).",1398854573

LessWrong, one of the largest online communities talking about (friendly) AI and the Intelligence Explosion, was founded by Eliezer Yudkowky. He was a co-blogger with Economist Robin Hanson, also a contributor to LessWrong. That&#x27;s not to say that Robin Hanson agrees with all the views, but they <i>are</i> aware of economics.<p>In fact, Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote a paper specifically on the economics of the Intelligence Explosion (<a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf</a>). He also regularly writes about economic matters.<p>As to your specific points:<p>&quot;However, who is going to pay for the manufacturing, energy, and maintenance costs of this self improving machine? Eventually, this machine will have to quit trying to design more intelligent machines and start solving HUMAN PROBLEMS. Why? Cause humans will actually pay for the solutions to problems that this intelligent machine can solve.&quot;<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not saying that this type of self improving machine would never be built. I just think that we will end up splitting the line between devoting resources to improving the machine to encourage future growth, and making money by solving problems that people are willing to pay for.&quot;<p>For a very advanced intelligence, creating its own resources isn&#x27;t a problem. E.g. humans. We make our own resources. The AI doesn&#x27;t have to rely on humans necessarily. Maybe only in the beginning.<p>&quot;Also note that as this machine gets more and more powerful, the problem of making itself better will get more and more complex, and as I think we can all agree on, complexity is our greatest enemy.&quot;<p>That sounds reasonable. But the limit that a superior intelligence reaches can be many orders of magnitude above where humans are on the spectrum. E.g., things that are overly complex for monkeys have been achieved by humans, despite the fact that they are much more complex.",1398854172

Their is a reason functional programming relies so heavily on equational reason and pure FP relies heavily on static typing: the alternative, actually debugging programmers, is so painful that you just want to avoid that at all costs.<p>A loop is way easier to debug than a filter or a map, you just step through it. Who cares about code length? Haskell doesn&#x27;t become a usable language until someone comes up with a decent dataflow debugger, if that&#x27;s even possible.",1398852532

From what I understand this is used primarily on Firefox OS to sandbox app runtimes.<p>Doing one process per tab, which is what Chrome does, comes at a very steep cost in increased memory usage.  If you compare a Chrome and Firefox instance holding 20 or 30 tabs, the memory consumption is going to be dramatically different.<p>Bill McCloskey did a nice writeup on this back in December: <a href=""http://billmccloskey.wordpress.com/2013/12/05/multiprocess-firefox/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://billmccloskey.wordpress.com/2013/12/05/multiprocess-f...</a><p>His article explains how you can try out the experimental multi-process support in Firefox, but that it works differently to Chrome&#x27;s.  I think Chrome&#x27;s way of doing it wastes a lot of system resources and that we need to be more clever about how we spend a user&#x27;s system resources.",1398852522

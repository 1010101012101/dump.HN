A couple reasons:<p>* If you use clock dividers to get a particular frequency, then change the main clock, you have to make sure you changed every instance in the code to a new divider ratio.

You can clean up PHP and break compatibility, but then you've lost much of its value (and what you'd get wouldn't be better than Ruby or Python anyway). I'd bet most PHP users don't even know PHP, they just install Wordpress or Drupal to run their site and maybe modified some templates etc.<p>As for deployment, it's easier because it's already there.

Maybe they are holding down ""alt"" while right-clicking and dragging to highlight half of a misspelled word. In this situation, you really need a lot of testers. And this is a lot of what Microsoft does, local applications like Office and the operating system itself.<p>By contrast, websites avoid a lot of this sort of testing. You don't have to test what happens if a user clicks on a link in a strange way - that's the responsibility of the browser. Or if you work on a part of the Google search engine, you can replay query traffic to see if it crashes. That will test a heck of a lot more corner cases than any tester. With web-delivered services you can also fix glitches as you find them, which minimizes the cost of missing a bug.",1229371981

If a programmer is paid $40/hr to complete something in 1 hour and it takes a ""business analyst"" being paid $20/hr to complete the same logic without code in 2 hours, it makes much more sense to pay the programmer overall...  It's really all assumptions up until there is something to disprove the theory.",1229371918

Most parties camp at least one night above 8000m and weather / SNAFU's often hold them there for multiple days  So the total time above 8000 varies by much more than the half day it takes to walk down.<p>No doubt though, the death zone could kill people playing ping pong.  Yet the down-climbing problem is global to mountains of any size.  The extreme altitude on Everest amplifies it.  More accidents occur on the way down on mountains less than half the size of Everest.

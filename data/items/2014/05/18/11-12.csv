7762787,comment,7743186,7760056,1,0,oelmekki,,,"> The time you spend writing a simple &quot;network configuration file must exist&quot; is way less than you&#x27;d spend trying to read a stack trace when your application crashes with &quot;filenotfound: foo.json&quot;.<p>Well, stacktrace and enforcing meaningful message error where they are generated is fine with me, but I see what you mean. Certainly, if we were to think of custom message everywhere a problem may happen, it will be easier to debug. But does it really worth it ?<p>> If Go is 1/5th as productive as Ruby [...]<p>All assertions probably apply :) I began to learn and use ruby (even if not professionally at first) before rails was a thing, so I&#x27;m quite used to it. On the contrary, I&#x27;ve began to use go only a few weeks ago. It took me a week during a week off (with the slow pace it implies) to learn the language and re-implement that task I thought was a perfect fit. So yeah, that&#x27;s indeed very productive, and that&#x27;s what I was attracted by in the first place. I also probably have done horrible mistakes that would have make this time shorter, since I&#x27;m still learning the language.<p>But let not underestimate ruby here, and more importantly : its ecosystem. Certainly, if I had to use only ruby standard library, it wouldn&#x27;t have been that fast. But with the help of activerecord and activesupport, things suddenly get really fast.<p>After learning to use database/sql, I&#x27;ve searched for something allowing me to save time, and switched to coocood/qbs. It helped a lot (especially on managing connection pool to postgres, since I was parallilizing queries), but of course it can&#x27;t compare with something that mature than activerecord.<p>That&#x27;s not intrinsic value of the language, but it clearly affects what it means to write a feature using the language in term of time.<p>> I honestly don&#x27;t understand how you can only care about 10% of errors<p>Well, I guess it depends on what kind of software you&#x27;re writing. If I were to design a public facing server app, certainly, the last thing I would like to happen would be it to panic and quit. In my previous case, I was rewriting a non-destructive data processing background job, called by cron. If it fails, cron will mail me with details and try again later ; that&#x27;s perfectly fine.<p>But let not be mistaken on what I mean by &quot;I care about 10% of errors&quot;. It does not mean I don&#x27;t want to know there were errors the rest of the time. It means that I don&#x27;t want some specially crafted logic handling it to ensure data / runtime state. Having the program interrupted and a report made with error message and stacktrace is ok most of the time (for the rare occasions when it happens). Let take some actual examples.<p>A table in my database has an hstore field, which represents in application what we would call in go a `map[int] int`. Except that in hstore, all is string, actually. So in my go code, I have :<p><pre><code>    key, err := strconv.Atoi( hkey )\n</code></pre>\nI can understand why this function generates error, and that&#x27;s a good thing, conversion to int may fail. But in my case, I know for sure I have a numeric string. So yeah, certainly, someone may introduce a bug somewhere sometime that will put a non numeric key in the hstore. But the low degree of probability for this makes me ok to deal with a message like &quot;can&#x27;t convert &#x27;foo&#x27; to integer&quot; with a stacktrace showing the line number when it happens (and indeed, once again, this instruction is followed by `if err != nil { panic( err ) }`).<p>An other example is database query functions. They all return an error, in order to relay database errors and connection to database errors. That is fine, this is information I want. But do I really need to add chunks of logic testing for those after every single query I make ? Again, having a default &quot;raise and die&quot; handling, with a few chunks of logic to ensure data integrity where it&#x27;s at risk (on writings, for example) would be enough.",1400414020

I never focus on learning words. I always learn words in the context of a sentence. I choose my sentences by taking them from things people say, books I read, videos I watch, etc...This is especially helpful because when I review the sentences in the SRS sometime later, I will read the sentence and almost always recall the broader context in which I learned it (the page in the book, the scene in the movie).

And making money was a great motivator for them to get better, and &#x27;grow&#x27; out of php, or at least start using better CMS&#x27; or frameworks (or write their own wordpress plugins). I&#x27;ve found that especially designers who &#x27;know a bit of html&#x27; seem to get pretty far with Wordpress and a bit of jQuery they copy and paste.<p>The result is usually an abomination in my eyes, but hey, if they&#x27;re getting by doing it, and especially if it&#x27;s a gateway to getting better at actual programming, why not? That&#x27;s how I did it!<p>But I I also partly disagree in that I&#x27;ve also met quite a few web &#x27;developers&#x27; who did so well &#x27;snippeting&#x27; their Wordpress/joomla sites together, that they never moved beyond that and eventually succumbed to fierce competition. Because now they&#x27;re competing with non-programming designers who can build fancy looking websites with cool interactivity, and are better at making it look good.<p>Because I&#x27;ve seen both good and bad come out of it, I usually try to gauge what kind of person I have in front of me when they approach me for help or advice.<p>If it&#x27;s someone who doesn&#x27;t seem to have the inherent curiosity to become a better programmer, I might just help them set up their first wordpress site and do my best to keep them from doing too much &#x27;damage&#x27;.<p>If I do see a bit of curiosity, I try to gently steer them towards other solutions (Middleman + heroku, or Ruby on Rails for example) that are a nice midpoint between some &#x27;coding&#x27; and seeing quick results.<p>And if I think I have full-blown future programmer in front of me, I just throw tons of stuff at them, usually right in the browser dev console, (closures, callbacks, functional-style programming) and relish seeing them try to figure it out and go home and tinker with a Fiddle!

I do not however, think that given proper instruction and supervision, the exercises and rep ranges are particularly problematic. The key point to keep in mind regarding CrossFit is the end goal, the CrossFit games. CrossFitters are not training to be bodybuilders, powerlifters, strongmen, football players or sprinters, they are training to be CrossFitters. If they do a WOD, it is not designed optimally to make them aesthetic or strong, it is designed to improve them in competition. Much like you would not go to an athletic track and complain that the sprinters are not optimally training for a marathon or go to a powerlifting gym and complain the players are not training optimally for bodybuilding, why would you go to a CrossFit gym and complain they aren&#x27;t training optimally for any number of other forms of competition that involve weight?<p>That said, it should be clear to people when they sign up to a CrossFit gym that this is indeed the case and other benefits are side effects.",1400413235

Why do you think they are &quot;generally bad&quot;?<p>The author mentions regarding swings, &quot;I don’t do those either because it is not a beneficial movement for the body and typically puts the back in bad positions&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure what angle she&#x27;s coming from here (aesthetics?) but explosive hip extension is extremely important for many sports involving sprinting and jumping and kettlebell swings are a nice exercise that&#x27;s easier to learn than varieties of clean. Like any other lift it has its own risks but there is no reason that with good form one can&#x27;t perform swings without risking the back any more than other exercises.<p>Her comment about deadlifts is pretty questionable and I wonder what the author is replacing them with for hip dominant movements. I wonder if in this instance she is specifically talking about heavy barbell deadlifts where the back is often the limiting factor rather than the deadlift movement (single leg, staggered, etc) as a whole. The excerpt, &quot;I had never done and to this day I still don’t do them&quot; is pretty suspicious given that the knowledge she would need to have to make an informed decision about whether deadlifts are worthwhile is unlikely to be something she would have had when she started lifting.

7762747,comment,7762413,7762617,7,0,commandar,,,">  * I personally, like the author of this post, don&#x27;t do deadlifts and rarely do kettlebell swings. I am not a professional athlete or trainer, but I really primarily only heard of people getting hurt with these workouts, so I chose to avoid them. Sounds like this was a good decision. There are substitute workouts for each.<p>I absolutely would not do deadlifts within the context of Crossfit. It&#x27;s an exercise best suited for very low reps at high weights, and proper form cannot be ignored. Sane novice programs will often only hit deadlifts once a week for a single set of five. Either way, it has to be approached systematically and intentionally trained - it&#x27;s not well suited to being randomly thrown into a workout, especially if it&#x27;s done under time pressure or at high reps.<p>That said, done properly and with proper attention given to form, it&#x27;s not only a completely safe exercise, it&#x27;s also one of the single most effective exercises out there. It engages a huge range of muscle groups and is very easy to increase load over time. While form is critical, it&#x27;s also one of the easier compound lifts to do correctly.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to say that everyone absolutely must to do deadlifts or anything. I&#x27;m just saying there&#x27;s no reason to be <i>afraid</i> of them. It&#x27;s a great exercise, and I&#x27;m saying that as somebody that found deadlifts to be the single most effective exercise when <i>recovering</i> from a lower back injury, which is the part that seems to scare most people.",1400412594

Said department was part of a larger organisation which of course kept everything centrally on huge mainframes, access to said mainframe being allowed in the regional office by means of a green-screen terminal connected to a dedicated line.<p>While the mainframe was of course the ultimate authority of what was what, for everyone, our local department just wanted to do some basic employee management on the then new wave of Windows 3.1-based softwares running on local PCs.<p>But how to populate the PC data? Obviously retyping it was the only possible way, and I was hired literally to do that and nothing else for a month. First thing I said, naturally, was &quot;why not just export it from the mainframe?&quot;<p>Not possible, I was assured. The mainframe was a secure device for storing secure data and no talk of exporting would ever get through the layers of bureaucracy. The mainframe terminal had no disc drive or local storage, being a thoroughly secure device with a secure connection through the secure floorboards. And anyway, I was hired as a typist so would I please get on with it for the next month, which was how long they had estimated would be required.<p>An hour later the job was done - with no retyping at all, thank you very much.<p>How? Well, I&#x27;ll admit to feeling rather too pleased with myself for knowing that the terminal&#x27;s attached dot matrix printer was not the only device that could speak RS232. Connected the secure terminal to an entirely not secure PC, and printed everything I wanted straight to disc. Edited the captured file in Wordstar and fairly quickly had a CSV-type file that went straight into the standalone software.<p>Although I&#x27;d effectively instantly put myself out of a job, they were good enough to keep me around.

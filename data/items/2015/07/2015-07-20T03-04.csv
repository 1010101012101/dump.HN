9913923,comment,9913209,9913829,0,0,arthurcolle,,,"I completely agree.<p>Even characterizations of our past financial crisis (late 2000s financial crisis) as being &quot;the worst since the Great Depression&quot; miss the major difference between it and previous financial crises.<p>The superficial similarity is that it was tangentially related to an &#x27;asset bubble&#x27; (which is the common shared element of most financial crises), but the deeper and more troubling component (troubling in the sense of it hopefully not being an omen for later crises to occur) was the fact that it got out of control because of the omnipresence in late &#x27;08 markets of financial instruments designed to allow accredited investors to gain exposure to specific market segments, which then became extremely popular among banking houses and other financial market actors. People commonly view this as the same thing but never before had a class of specific financial products (in this case, RMBSs - residential mortgage backed securities and their related derivative instruments) become so extremely popular that their universal acceptance acted as a prelude to their total deterioration in value.<p>To preempt subsequent comments:<p>Yes, LBOs became super popular in the 80s and are kinda sorta similar but these aren&#x27;t really financial products at all. They are mechanisms to finance the takeover of companies based on debt and financial products are involved but never before had downturns been so driven by the creation of market-specific financial instruments.<p>The increasing complexity of financial markets is super awesome and will allow the blossoming of a wide variety of financial opportunities for interested parties, but this obfuscation should not come at the cost of... submerging entire market economics lol",1437364707
9913922,comment,9912863,9913773,0,0,Sanddancer,,,"I feel that the machine here is borne more out of ideology than logic or necessity. The laptops in question, and the software installed, are designed to take away any ability to do things that the designers do not like. For example, the ability to update the CPU&#x27;s microcode, or load firmware for numerous devices. I would argue the rational approach would be to not ship the firmware, but keep the drivers in place for a user to use them and the firmware, if they so desire.<p>Regarding RMS, I do not feel that he is a good spokesperson for the Free Software movement, or computing in general. He&#x27;s requested people to delete Free software and pretend it doesn&#x27;t exist because it could potentially be used with unwritten software to potentially allow a non-free program to use gcc as part of its chain [1]. He has criticized software because it allows interoperation with a perceived enemy [2]. Lower down on my list of criticisms would be his use of the x60, because it is in a lot of ways saying that free software is an inferior good. Instead of trying to work with a team to create a completely open laptop, like Bunnie Huang has done [3], or use a Chromebook that runs a Free software boot environment by design, he uses a very old laptop instead. Which in the end, is one of the biggest flaws with RMS&#x27;s operations. He seems unwilling to show that one can use Free, modern, devices and still not limit himself.<p>I use sharp words because I am tired of the lack of vision, lack of foresight, and lack of creativity from the gnu branch of free/open software. Modifying a seven year old laptop and making it less functional is not revolutionary or interesting. Selling said item for a three time markup is not revolutionary or interesting. There are more than enough options out there, the Free software community needs to put up or shut up.<p>[1] <a href=""https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2001-02/msg00895.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2001-02/msg00895.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-02/msg00360.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-02/msg003...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?tag=novena"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?tag=novena</a>",1437364697

9913915,comment,9913209,9913730,0,0,Gibbon1,,,"I&#x27;ve heard other somewhat contrary things, one is the birthrate started falling well before the &#x27;29 crash indicating that working class and especially farming communities were actually not doing well economically. You can look up graphs if you want, but the birthrate drops relentlessly from 3.2 in 1920, to 2.2 by 1930. As the economy improves post 1935 the rate picks up again.<p>My take on recessions and debt is to consider that when an entity (family, business, etc) pays off debt they are foregoing some consumption. Key thing. Now in normal times foregoing of consumption frees up economic output that is invested in the real economy. As I pay off my mortgage, the bank reinvests that money in building more houses. A virtuous cycle, depending how much you like concrete, sprawl and freeways.<p>In a debt driven recession there is a problem, the economy isn&#x27;t limited by available production. There is a lack of demand. Because as people frantically pay of debt they are foregoing consumption that doesn&#x27;t free up more physical or labor resources for investment. It just creates a lack of demand. The money instead goes to correct balance sheets which is something that exists on paper (or in modern times le computer machine).<p>That&#x27;s the situation many parts of the developed world are in today. The solution is for the government to step in an manually rebalance consumer and commercial balance sheets. A political problem exists when the people in charge can&#x27;t let go of the &#x27;paper wealth&#x27;. And that&#x27;s the current issue.",1437364456

It&#x27;s a necessity.  I don&#x27;t feel large entities should be able to buy up large units of housing, and dole them out when the market suits their greed.  Even for personal realestate speculation, I don&#x27;t think anyone should be able to own more than 5 homes.(I just picked that number out of the air).  In other words, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of realestate speculation, and whenever I hear about corporations buying up huge swaths of homes, I think about Gordon Gekko, &#x27;Greed is good!&#x27;, and my blood pressure rises.<p>While I&#x27;m at it--what&#x27;s up with letting foreigners buy our land, before they become citizens?

If you are aware of a particular product or vendor <i>at all</i>, it is because of advertising.<p>Of the people in the world who are economically useful, they are useful only insofar as as people want the things they help produce.

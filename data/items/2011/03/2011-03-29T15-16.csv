These are marketing dollars that are getting spent not out of ego, but simply to keep the train on the tracks.<p>Compared to those expenses, no matter how much it costs to engage Dalton Maag, it's still probably a rounding error.<p>Wouldn't you rather live in a world where big companies occasionally gave excellent typographers interesting problems to work on, rather than paying someone to round the corners on FF Meta or something?",1301414267

I still think talking to actual people is more informing, because they'll often indicate secondary or even completely irrelevant information that is more important. An experiment will mainly either confirm or disprove an existing hypothesis (though you may still get some info by asking for feedback etc - just much less, and less often, than from a live conversation). In summary: personal contact helps (said to be a comparative advantage of SV).<p>Can people really lauch several mini-webapps over lunch? I guess if you have rails hosting setup and know your way round a domain name registrar, and practice this a few times, you really could get that fast (for, of course, simple webapps, like isitdownforeveryoneorjustme, or isitfriday etc). Payment setup might be more hassle... but I guess if you have set up paypal once, it's not hard to repeat. There are also various 3rd party services (like Wufoo/google forms, fax, recurring charges, etc) and APIs. Though you couldn't learn them all and use them several times over lunch, after a little practice you could (maybe just one use is enough).<p>Who cares what you call yourself?

Since this is a Hacker Community I thought you all might be interested in some stats and info about the project:<p>---<p>I think MagicScroll's doing pretty well in terms of uptake but I don't have any kind of tracking implemented yet so I'm a bit blind.<p>I've got just over 6000 users from the Chrome Web Store.<p>https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghgnmgfdoiplfmhgghbmlphanpfmjble<p>On my server logs I get between 700 and 900 hits to my cache manifest file every 24 hours with more over the weekend. As near as I can tell users turn a books page an average of just less than 400 times an hour.  (Each page turn involves a round trip to the server for syncing purposes). More than 95% of the hits are coming from Chrome so I think there's a lot of room to expand.<p>---<p>I didn't build MagicScroll as a commercial venture but based on its limited popularity I do think it has the potential to create revenue, and I now hope to build a business around it.  In the next month or so I plan to create a paid extension similar to Readability that will allow websites to be read using MagicScroll.  I also intend to build an API for booksellers to allow MagicScroll to be integrated into their stores.  If MagicScroll does gain a significant number of users I hope to integrate my own ebook store into it but I think that will be in a year or twos time at the earliest.<p>---<p>For those of you interested in the programming side.  It is built in GWT and runs on the Google App Engine.  I'm embarrassed to say that I don't have any real knowledge of javascript though I'm trying to rectify that.  There are about 30 lines of native javascript in the project most of which facilates communication between the frame that holds the book and the UI.<p>The entire project is heavily cached and apart from unzipping the ePUB and some security logic everything happens clientside.  There are obviously a lot of advantages to this and it was quite easy to do because I was working in GWT.  In fact I found that the same logic on the client often runs significantly faster than it does on the App Engine server.<p>To do page rendering I'm using a very simple binary search.  I draw a page with a certain number of characters and if it overflows I draw it half the size and then half between that and so on.  It's quick but I have no idea how Google has managed to get their pages in Google Books to render so fast, or to change the font size without redrawing.<p>One thing I've perhaps overrelyed on is AsyncCallbacks here's part of the code that draws the book:<p><pre><code>        LoadDialog.get().show(""Loading Book.

The DelayedCallback works like a normal callback but introduces a 1 millisecond delay to avoid the browser from thinking the code has frozen.  SimpleCallback is just like AsyncCallback but without the onFailure method.  If an exception occurs the program halts instead of recovering.<p>I made it so that whenever an uncaught exception occurs I get emailed about it.  This has massively increased my stress levels but I think its contributed to the stability of the code so I'll probably do the same in the future.  I now get less than 20 errors a day.  Mostly if someone tries to use MagicScroll with IE7 or if they try to read an encrypted book.<p>Anyway thanks for letting me ramble, I'm interested to know what HN thinks.",1301413193

Take it or leave it.<p>When I was 11 years old and in the 7th grade, I was failing most of my classes. I was a big problem for teachers. I talked a lot and was generally distracted; also a distraction for other students. My teachers wanted to put me in the ""STAR"" program, which was for learning disabled students. My parents protested, demanding that I be thoroughly tested.<p>I spent a full week being evaluated by psychologists and special-needs specialists. A psychologist administered an IQ test, which came back over 170. If I recall correctly, the first score was 174. They re-administered the test with another psychologist resulting in a score of 169. My teachers smugly denied having thought I was dumb and fell back to the position that being in the STAR program would help solve my ""focus"" issues; despite any in appropriateness for my learning ability.<p>I barely made it through my first year of high school. I graduated with a 2.7 GPA. It wasn't because I couldn't solve the problems -- I liked learning the material and passed tests readily -- it was that I wouldn't do the work. Squandering ability is pretty stupid thing to do.<p>This isn't a ""look how smart I am"" post. Do I think I'm smart? It'd be disingenuous for me to say no, but if I look at the outcome of my life, I can say without any feeling of self-disrespect that having a ""genius"" IQ hasn't netted me much. This isn't to say I haven't achieved success. To the contrary, I'm the proud owner of a business that does a couple million dollars a year in revenue and solves some fun problems, but by the measure of the greats, I've done nothing.<p>So what does my IQ mean? It means I'm well suited to taking IQ tests. I wouldn't want to discourage this 12-yr old from pursuing his dreams, but I would caution against recognizing IQ as a universal predictor of greatness.",1301412954

Some people think the greatest strength of <i>homo sapiens</i> is our intelligence - but history suggests that it is our ability to cooperate (to share insights, build on them and to specialize) that is our real talent - our collective intelligence. Lisp's community celebrates individual, non-collective intelligence; people re-implement work themselves rather than reuse others' work.<p>It's not just the ""community"" though, there are also technical factors: the purpose of much of Java's ""ceremony"" is to facilitate re-use, especially in larger projects. Lisp's prototyping strengths are reuse weaknesses - a natural trade-off.<p>I like esr's point that lisp gives you additional perspectives in other languages - though a mathematical approach, which lisp models in some ways, gives this more strongly IHMO.<p><i>EDIT</i> I invite rebuttal of the specific points raised in this comment.",1301412846

Perhaps it will let car manufacturers know that their Britain division will not do as well in 2050 if they do not develop now, but I doubt that's what they were going for. I think the EU needs to provide consumer incentives to buy EVs, such as designated lanes or parking, or tax rebates. Companies producing electric cars are really going out on a limb right now, and until they know that there's some kind of serious demand beyond the environmentally minded, who simply want AN electric car to exist, they can't understand their demographics or create a sense of direction for their R&D. Quite simply, If governments want electric cars to catch on, they need to turn the project into an industry, not a charity effort. And for the industry to catch initially, the companies need to understand the demands of their first customers, those who are most willing to buy. They can build from there. The idea of creating a deadline turns the prospect into more of a charity effort toward the environment, not a self regulating, consumer rich industry. Environmental aspiration is important, which is why the governments need to press the gas pedal in the first place, but the companies need real paying customers to grow, not deadlines.<p>That, or I'm missing something having to do with the logistics of this whole thing.",1301411767

It has been a genuine challenge on many levels. I've observed various families with the minimum of means achieve success home educating, but in general it is folks that have a solid single income and understand that they are making a ""sacrifice"".

Suppose the average American (just a reference class that I feel OK making guesses about) really is getting dumber, more hedonistic, and more prone to distraction.  Is this going to kill us?<p>The same technology that is causing problems for the average American is opening up awesome new opportunities for anyone who gives a shit.  My life is <i>way</i> better than it would have been twenty years ago; I can get any book I please and it arrives instantly, or in a few days.  I can take as much time as I like online and have careful conversations with smarter people than me, or collaborate with them.  Anyone can self-publish anything and be judged by their peers on its merit, and I can generally go read it and judge them for myself.

It doesn't matter. Just assume I'm wrong. If my information doesn't fit with a reader's model, the value of what I am saying is lost. With some types of information, there is no way to say it ""the right way"" -- it's just not going to fit. Perhaps 99% of that information is bad, perhaps not, but if we don't consume it, we'll never know. Several people still never got to the point of the article.

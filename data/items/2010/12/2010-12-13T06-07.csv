1999649,comment,1999340,1999628,0,0,aneesh,,,"md5 is a hash function, and hash functions are designed to have two properties:<p>1) they are <i>hiding</i>.  You (theoretically) can't reverse the function by any method other than brute-force.<p>2) they are *binding.  You (theoretically) can't find any other input that hashes to the same output by any method other than brute-force.<p>Any tool that ""decrypts"" md5 hashes most likely does so by generating what is called a rainbow table -- a giant list of many possible inputs, and the hashes they generate.  If you look at the spreadsheet and find a hash from your rainbow table, voila, you know what it came from.  To make it harder to use rainbow tables, any security-conscious site will ""salt"" the passwords before hashing them, by adding a random string prefix.  The point is for the random ""salt"" to be different for each password you are hashing, so a standard (unsalted) rainbow table won't work, and further, the same rainbow table won't work for every password.<p>(md5 itself has been shown to be vulnerable to collision attacks, which is why I said ""theoretically"")",1292223432
1999648,comment,1999340,1999628,0,0,ThePengwin,,,"an MD5 hash is a one-way encryption, you cant reverse an MD5 hash to reveal what creates it. The quickest way to decrypt an MD5 hash is if someone calculates and stores all the possible combinations and then you look up to find them (known as rainbow tables), otherwise you just have to use brute force. Even so, the returned value could be different again, as there is only so many combinations that md5 can make (although for something as long as a password or email address, thats highly unlikely).<p>md5decrypter would just be a big database of tested strings and their MD5 hash,",1292223420

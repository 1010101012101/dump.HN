If your grandmother had a stroke, it&#x27;s unlikely that she was overdosed, though - in fact, it&#x27;s quite likely that she received <i>too low</i> a dose.<p>If someone has a stroke under warfarin treatment, there are two likely causes: Either their warfarin dose was too low, or they had an artery-to-artery embolic stroke instead of the cardioembolic stroke the warfarin was supposed to prevent. (There are of course other, more rare cases of stroke, but those are the two big ones.)<p>Do you see how there&#x27;s a huge potential for misunderstandings here?

I can understand that the 3 companies were interpreting the raw data differently, but were the underlying snp frequencies consistent?<p>If they are not consistent, then the whole thing is pointless and they need to work on better kits. If they are consistent, it still doesn&#x27;t say much.<p>Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are very hard to control. And most papers tend to ignore external factors when they conduct the analysis. Do these group of people have this phenotype because of particular snps or do they have it because they have similar diets, similar geographic area, similar age range?",1388574192

By the time more non-gaming applications outside of media editing are using GPUs more extensively, the top end mobile graphics chips will have the power of this dual GPU setup.<p>It&#x27;s a bold bet on a possible trend, which I like a lot, since it would mean that non-gamers would profit from the GPUs that would otherwise bore themselves to death on their machines. Also, it would give AMD a better position, maybe averting x86 being a complete Intel monopoly.",1388574033

I think many of these agencies are starting to ask for funding specifically for these sort of &quot;operations&quot;, where they not only try and convince people to commit crimes, but give them all the funding and resources they need to commit them, too.<p>We&#x27;ve gotten to the point where the government has to manufacture or invent crimes in order to arrest people. Even the War on Drugs isn&#x27;t enough for them anymore. They need more. I&#x27;m actually really curious what will happen when the War on Drugs will end. Because that would leave a huge hole in their plan to criminalize just about everyone.<p>Will they start sending SWAT teams to people&#x27;s homes for pirating movies? Will they start arrest people on the street for pissing them off somehow? I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m really curious what would happen. I certainly don&#x27;t expect them to just lay back and ease up on the arrests, if the War on Drug is over.<p>[1] <a href""http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/watchdogreports/atf-uses-rogue-tactics-in-storefront-stings-across-the-nation-b99146765z1-234916641.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/watchdogreports/atf-uses-ro...</a>",1388574028

488566,comment,488369,488419,0,0,gaius,,,"I think it's more subtle than that; it's edge vs core. Edge systems are the ones (non-tech) people interact with, and have a very high turnover. 3270 one day, then Visual Basic, then Cold Fusion, then Java, then AJAX, then... There's a lot of churn so there's work, but there's also a lot of elasticity, a company won't really hurt if it delays projects like this for a year, it can even skip a generation. Core systems are the ones that operate the business. There's a lot less churn here and fewer people employed... But if a change needs to be made to support a new product or process or regulation or to integrate an acquired company, then it <i>has</i> to be done. Similarly these systems <i>have</i> to be up 24/7 and there are people needed to do that.<p>My experience over 15 years (almost all of it core) is that edge people can make fortunes and get written up in magazines in the good times as <i>everyone</i> jumps onto the latest bandwagon but suffer in the bad times when everyone realizes that what they've got does the job perfectly well and if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Core people have much stabler careers, but will never be ""rockstars"" (and we aren't interested in being either).",1235126369

488563,comment,488030,488557,0,0,jacquesm,,,"True enough :) Another big factor is that television / video by default are passive, in other words your brain is in a different mode than when you are reading. A person that is reading is far more likely to see an advertisement for what it is, an interruption of their day and a waste of bandwidth. Television / video consumers are more in the mood for wasting time and will pay attention to almost everything as long as it moves.",1235126039

488558,comment,488030,488030,0,0,markessien,,,"The problem does not lie with video - the problem is that video today is very linear. Even people who think they prefer text do not actually do so - they just prefer being in control of the reading speed and being able to immediately jump to the information they want.<p>Imagine video that behaved like a real person sitting opposite you. You type in google - ""Where is Tibet"", and a video immediately pops up with a person who says ""Tibet is in China"" and at the bottom of the video a bunch of relevant extra information popup, allowing you to jump up and down in the video. This would work a lot better.<p>Video has to become searchable, navigable, and you should be able to have an information context in any videos that you watch. Then the web will benefit by becoming video based.",1235125348

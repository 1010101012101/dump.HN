Europe seems to be lurching from banning some forms of Muslim identity outright (veils and head scarves) to banning anyone from saying anything bad about Islam.  In the U.S., we insist that Muslims abide by the same laws as everyone else, and that's pretty much it.  They don't have to dress like us or adopt the same social mores.  We are also used to people with strong religious beliefs freely expressing their opinions, because we still have a lot of practicing Christians, unlike Europe.   So strongly held religious beliefs don't seem so intimidating to us.<p>Yes, I know this is all a generalization, but from the anecdotes I read in the press, your comments, and anecdotes from some Europeans living in the U.S. I've talked to, I think there is some truth to it.",1263326274

I think it's important to remember that the language in their blog doesn't match their marketing message at all - if their front page emulated the same tone, I would be with you 100%.  But it doesn't.<p>I don't think broad claims of ""effective"" really make much sense either.  It seems silly to view someone's blog message from an outsiders perspective and make claims to it's effect on sales.  Did it turn you off to purchasing their product?   Do you know how many people it turned off?  Were those people even in the market to buy it in the first place?<p>Patrick also uses vastly different tones in his marketing messages and his blog.  His blog is about programming & business topics + the occasional silly thing.  His marketing is a rock-solid battle-worn message tested over hundreds of iterations.  Do you think that's ineffective?<p>There is plenty of place in the world for companies that act like humans are running it.  A blog is an appropriate channel for this to happen.  Zappos has shown that a human-sounding company approach can work.  You are welcome to your opinions - they very well may be right - but I would rather see the stimulation of discussion instead of brash opinions.

Startups whose founders got in on such visas would be easy to track. Any big successes that resulted would become prominently associated with the visa program. This would provide political cover against the sort of attacks that are perenially made against H1-Bs and so on. One new Google might even eliminate the controversy permanently. (Admittedly it would be hard to prove that the founders wouldn't have gotten in some other way. But I'm not sure that matters.)",1253385532

832205,comment,831958,832023,0,0,timr,,,"<i>""a lot of doomsayers were getting more credence than they should have...but as always, the ""middle way"" proves right.""</i><p>If you're just looking at the rest of the world in comparison to history, then yes, things are getting better.  China's economy is growing; so are the economies of southeast Asia.  Africa is becoming more stable.  Child mortality is falling around the world.  This is good.<p>But it's a mistake to look at that information and conclude that the <i>American</i> doomsayers are wrong.  The US middle class has been decimated by the same economic forces that are benefiting Asia.  Low-skill jobs are being shipped away, leaving millions of people in this country unemployed, and slipping into poverty.  We've had back-to-back recessions, and it looks like neither recovery is going to regain the jobs lost.  US citizens are more indebted than ever.  There are good reasons to believe that the days of US economic resilience may be over.<p>We've masked our problems with debt spending over the last decade, but that isn't sustainable.  Meanwhile, the first-world credit bubble has been <i>funding</i> the economic expansion in Asia, and we give tons of international aid to help bring down child mortality and cure diseases.  What happens when we can't afford that anymore? (we can't afford it now!)<p>There are reasons to be optimistic about global development, but this guy isn't the ""middle way"".",1253385390

Are you saying you don't support the principle of visas for startup founders? That's what ""founders visa"" says and means.<p>I reread the original proposal to see if PG mentioned VCs.

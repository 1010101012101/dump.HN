Yes, because of depopulation it is hard to get groceries, do your banking, or catch public transportation. But this does not mean the 700,000ish Americans who live in the city proper live in ""anarchy"".<p>In Michigan's Upper Peninsula there are also many roads that don't get salted and plowed, and long waits for ambulances - do those people also live in anarchy?",1350763108

As Ryan Jones (via Forbes) observes, ""a price umbrella is the cover that a market leader provides other companies by establishing a premium price for their products. Competitors can enter the market at lower price points and disrupt the leaders dominance, in Jones words, 'from the bottom up.'""<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/07/22/apple-will-sell-a-smaller-ipad-or-be-disrupted-from-the-bottom-up-by-google-and-amazon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/07/22/apple-w...</a><p>Per this logic, $299 seems like the best bet. This is $100 lower than the point where iPad and iPod prices presently converge ($399 for either a 64GB Touch or a 16GB iPad 2). This move would also mean dropping the price of the 64GB Touch to $299 (where the 32GB model currently sits) and dropping the 32 GB to $249, which is where you find the 160 GB iPod classic ($100 above the new nano).",1350763015

4678073,comment,4672637,4676325,1,0,saraid216,,,"> I conclude a for-profit-society is more transparent and navigable than a profit-for-society.<p>That doesn't follow, though. This is just as much fairy dust as the notion of everyone having a fair and equal say into ""the agenda"": not everyone is motivated by profit. You can pretend that they are and model them to be such, but you're inevitably incorrect.<p>Now, you could force them to be for-profit. But if you could do that, you could also force them to be profit-for-society. Why do the former rather than the latter?<p>> If one were to assume that everyone else lived a profit-for-society life, then one defector would be able to manipulate the entire society to their personal aims.<p>This is the problem of the demagogue, or ""why direct democracy doesn't work"". My ideas are an outgrowth of a proposal for education reform precisely because this is the most necessary step. The most effective countermeasure to the demagogue that we know of is a two-pronged response: (1) information saturation, such that any lies or half-truths are easily exposed and (2) critical thinking, such that the demagogue finds zirself useful only for thought leadership, but not thought determination.<p>And while you might imagine that #1 is being reached by the Internet, and I agree that it has made significant leaps and strides in the right direction, it is not remotely enough. The Internet does not reach enough people, and of the people it reaches, we have filter bubbles and echo chambers.<p>> Your proposal is akin to the ideal anarcho-capitalists* have, in that states compete.<p>Absolutely not. Please don't read in things I didn't say. I am not a Social Darwinist, and I'd prefer not to be lumped in with those who are. The paragraphs I wrote in my vision only outline legislative mechanisms; they do not consider changes in the judiciary or in the execution of law.",1350762842

IANAL, but I was under the impression that an important part of the Berne Convention was to give authors the right to approve translations in other countries, ie so that an American company could not translate and sell copies of Crime and Punishment without getting the approval of (and therefore compensating) Dostoyevsky.<p>This the interpretation I've seen repeated amongst many fan translation groups, the implications of which vary amongst mediums from ""we don't have a legal right to anything we translate, but we'll try to voice our disapproval anyway,"" typically said by manga scanlators to the giant, quasi-legal online manga sites who they have little power over, to ""we may not have a right to our translation, but we do own the rights to our code, and we will use that ownership to send DMCA takedown producers of pirate 'reproduction' cartridges"" in the translation hacking scene.<p>In response to the, uh, great grand parent post, even if they are not legally entitled to protection for their unauthorized derivative works, I think they are justified in their feelings of ownership toward them. People in the various fan translation scenes put a hell of a lot of their own free time into their works; even if the law does not support it, in a ""common sense"" kind of way, I find it difficult to believe that they do not have the moral high ground here.",1350762555

I have a Transformer 101 with the keyboard dock. The dock is awesome! Extra battery, USB port, and a great way to type long emails! Hardware: great, software not so much. Boot loader access is restricted in my TF101 (Asus provides an unlock tools for later/premium models but not mine) but luckily there is an open source, reversed unlocker letting me run Ubuntu! Ubuntu was a huge hassle to get working but a great dev environment. Asus took a few months with many delays to deliver 4.0. Rumor has it that it won't get 4.1 from Asus. So I would encourage you to look at a newer Transformer tablet with a keyboard but beware about future support.<p>The Surface is almost guaranteed to have great support for a long time given MS's history. Keyboard probably isn't as nice (it's squishy, right?) but much more compact than a Transformer keyboard.",1350760411

Setting the amount of free content lower may move the 'buy or not' decision earlier, and reduce dropoff, but it's still likely that some percentage of your players just aren't engaged enough to pay after already having played the game for a while.<p>This particular class of design problem mostly affects games, so it can be kind of strange if you're used to developing software. A good way to think of it is by looking at a program like a ringtone creator or icon editor: Very often, you grab a ringtone creator or icon editor just to create one or two ringtones or one or two icons. After that, you literally never want to use it again (or at best, maybe you want to use it again 6 months later). The group of people who use an app like that every day is vanishingly small. So, if you build one of those apps and you give away a fully-featured version, most downloads will never convert into purchases.",1350760394

Nothing. Looked for a ""try the app"" button. Nothing. Backed out, clicked the ""explore this device"" button instead.  Looked for a notes app on the home screen. Nothing. Clicked ""applications"". Greeted with 30 apps per screen. On the second page, found a ""Notes"" app and a ""Memo"" app. Guessed it was the memo app. Guessed incorrectly, that didn't support the stylus.

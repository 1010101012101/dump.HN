577770,comment,577373,577552,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"No kidding. Why are people so surprised that using an RDBMS well requires an understanding of databases? Database administration requires a very different skill set than programming, and DBAs have different priorities (e.g., Do NOT corrupt the data. <i>Ever.</i>); they're not just there to inconvenience programmers.<p>It seems like almost every time I've read a review of a database book, there's been somebody complaining that it's ""full of a bunch of boring theory"" (or else, ""at least this book doesn't have much boring theory""). At the same time, some programmers nonchalantly do things that could land them on a DBA's equivalent of The Daily WTF (e.g. <a href=""http://ask.metafilter.com/117908/Theres-got-to-be-a-faster-way-to-update"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ask.metafilter.com/117908/Theres-got-to-be-a-faster-w...</a>).

577762,comment,577730,577730,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"In terms of a long-term solution to the DNS cache poisoning issue it seems deep packet inspection could be the only way to go. The work-around was to extend the encryption involved with DNS but that only makes it harder, but not impossible for DNS hacks to take place. Only if deep packet inspection happens would DNS hacks truly become a thing of the past, since if my ISP is inspecting all the packets, and it's stored IP for say cnn.com gets re-routed to a hacker's IP, an inspection of the packets coming across could flag a problem to the ISP. I am not an expert in this area but I just recall from reading a 'Wired' article on this issue that the only really good solution here is in fact deep packet inspection. So outlawing it would be a hacker's wet dream, and by hacker I mean ""cracker"" or ""black hat"" people obviously.",1240591991
577761,comment,577532,577628,0,0,dr_strangelove,,,"To give you a background why vacuum is necessary: When you update a row in postgres, it is marked as deleted and a row with the updated contents is inserted. Likewise, when you delete a row, it is only marked as deleted but the space on disk will not automatically be reused. The vacuum process appends all these rows to the list of reusable rows.<p>If the autovacuum process is run too infrequently, the space used by the tables grows larger and there are many gaps between used rows. In addition to filling up more disk space than necessary this reduces sequencial scan performance. In this case you should run a vacuum full which packs the table and relases the unused space to the operating system (think of file system defragmentation). Unfortunately this is quite slow and uses table locks so you should not do it on a production system.<p>[EDIT:]

577759,comment,577081,577081,0,0,thehickmans,,,"This idea has a lot of potential, especially if you were to focus on a few situations that I've seen over and over in the corporate world.
The most common scenario I've seen is data coming in an extract format like CSV, containing information required for another business process. You've got data coming from an expense reporting web app that needs to processed before entries can be made into an accounting system. A spreadsheet or database is created by a computer-savvy manager, and a clerk uses it on a weekly basis to do their work of posting entries. If the data format changes, the manager tweaks macros and formulas to adjust, and life goes on. Any new clerks coming on board learn how to use ""the spreadsheet"" and the business process keeps chugging along. Change managers, and 9 times out of 10, a lack of documentation and knowledge transfer will cause things to blow up in a short period of time.
If you were to introduce a tool that exposes the funky macros and formulas in a more visual, understandable fashion, I think it becomes more easily maintainable. Providing some data validation, error handling and notifications would be valuable. Finally, provide some version control to prevent accidental deletion or modification of important functions. The key would be a much better user experience than the Excel function editor.",1240591948

Or let's say that you write your own language, which outputs to other 3 or 4... there's also compiling involved. A compiler doesn't need to output assembler. Even if every compiler did that, features of the language would result in different execution code.<p>For example, PHP's variables can be a string of any size, or a number, or an object, and you can change its type while the program is running. The compiler doesn't optimize the code execution as easy as, say, in Java. You can not allocated the minimum amount of memory that will store the variable values, for example.",1240591408

But in this sense the plan obviously fails because to even get to the point of spending cuts we have to use all our Government's available financial resources.<p>Second Reason: To empower the Private Sector.  But if the Government has gotten to the point where they've exhausted the majority of their financial resources they are going to be forced to levy high taxes to compensate.  That places a burden on businesses and makes them look to incorporating in other countries (just as most look to incorporate out side of California now).

I can see exactly where it's coming from, and yet I can't agree. Partly it's the blatant snobbery of it, which I know from my own experience. It's frustrating to see folk with no interest in the discipline do better because they're more focussed on getting a first than actually learning anything.<p>The thing is, the industry is a lot bigger than it seems when you're at university. Developers/programmers are actually a pretty small part of it. For example, software testing/validation is a job in itself which can involve very little coding. Professional documenters are paid to write about software and do very little coding, but an understanding of the field is still useful to them. And lets not forget the good old ranks of management, forever considered to be a complete waste of time that gets in the way of ""just hacking shit out"". Except it turns out people don't want shit.<p>So basically, just because somebody is on your course and doesn't want to spend all night fiddling with their ubuntu installation, reading HN and learning the stuff you know that you'll need for the job you want, doesn't mean they wont be able to hack it in industry.

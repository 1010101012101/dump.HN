When the SSD fails, the delivery time comparison is the AGE OF THE SUN.  Ok, I kid. You never get your data.  So, lets call ""Age of the sun"" an average between really fast and infinity.<p>I've owned 3 SSDs and have had 2 failures, so far, over 2 years[1].  In the past 20 years, I've owned around 100 hard drives and have had only 4 failures.<p>This is the achilles heel of the SSD for me.  I've gone back to spinning rust because I need the reliability more than I need the performance.<p>The performance was nice, very nice.  But having to restore from backup is something that I do not like doing every year.  I'd like to do it once a decade or less.<p>Until then, I'm no longer using SSDs.<p>I did a bunch of research into why SSDs fail and inevitably it seems to be software bugs due to the SSDs being clever.  I suspect the Samsung SSDs that Apple uses are not clever and thus do not fail.  I will use an SSD if it comes with an Apple warranty.  But I had an intel SSD fail, and I had a Sandforce based SSD fail.  Both catastrophically with zero data recovery (fortunately I had backed up, though in both cases I lost a couple hours of work for various reasons.) In both cases, near as I can tell, the SSD had painted itself into a corner-- it actually hadn't been used enough to have flash failures sufficient to be a problem, let alone in excess of the extra capacity set aside.  Nope, it was a management problem for the controller that caused the failures.   These kinds of problems can be worked out by the industry, but give that the market has existed for 3-4 years now and we're still having these kinds of problems, I'm going to wait before trying something clever again.<p>[1] The one that is still working is in my cofounders machine, and I'm dreading the day that it too fails.  I am afraid it is just a matter of time, and as soon as we can reshuffle things they'll be using spinning rust again as well.",1329364590

That would be a sign that the value the journal adds by selecting what get's published is apparently not worth the price they are charging. In fact, why wait 12 months?

You will, in time.<p><i>I got on the phone with the interviewer and one of the first things out of their mouth’s was “Sorry, I don’t really understand functional programming at all.”</i><p>My take on this one?

The jury's still out on its effects on serotonin, but anecdotally, it seems to help me sleep easier and more deeply.<p>The second thing is a falling-asleep routine that I think is probably closer to self-hypnosis than simple relaxation. I consciously slow my breathing and hold after each breath in or out for a 3-count. At the same time, I sort of visualize a wave moving slowly down my body from the top of my head, and where ever it touches, I relax those muscles. I'm usually asleep before it hits the legs. If it fails, I restart the exercise, with a 4-count on the breaths, and so on. Most nights, I'm asleep in just a couple of minutes; my wife frequently remarks on how fast I go from alert to dead asleep.<p>The effort of concentrating on both exercises tends to silence the ""inner voice"", and consciously relaxing muscles tends to remove blocks to sleeping that I didn't know were there; the nights that you can't sleep, you're probably laying there in bed clenching some set of muscles without realizing it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine</a>",1329363164

Looking at the median performance, or the mean +/- standard deviation, is much more informative.<p>A good example (which I picked up from <i>Gnuplot in Action</i>) is this: you're organising a marathon and need to know when to have end-of-race refreshments ready. You load end time records into a database, then take an average (say ... 1 hour, 30 minutes). You plan to put out drinks at 1 hour 15 minutes, expecting the bulk of the runners to arrive then.<p>The big day arrives. Suddenly, around the 50 minute mark, runners start arriving in surprisingly large quantities. It's a disaster, there's nothing for them to drink, and afterwards you live a life of chagrin and go to your grave humiliated (marathon runners are pretty serious people).<p>What the mean obscured was that the marathon times were bimodally distributed. About 20% of runners, serious marathoners, arrived ""early"", and the rest of the runners much later. If you'd thrown it up on a graph or looked at some other figures, you'd have known.

I actually love my time as a pedestrian tourist in European cities, hate them with a passion as a driver or when trying to do business.<p>It's interesting how many old cities were started as a heavily planned Roman garrison towns, straight boulevards, right angles everywhere, etc. Then those cores turned into the medieval rats nests we're familiar with today, then usually outside of that there was a building boom in the 19th century and a return to some kind of order.<p>But the advantage of the unplanned medieval layout is that the streets are usually an attempt at a shortest path between two interesting points.",1329361739

It was to your incorrect definition of what it means to be an encyclopedia. You've said:<p>- ""Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. It's a terrible place for original research."" I showed several examples of original research done for encyclopedias. One was the first use of the element symbols now used in every chemistry book.<p>- ""everyone's understanding of what an encyclopedia (ANY encyclopedia) is"" ... ""is not a place of first publication for new research findings."" In addition to the previous comment, this view falsely separates the scholarly research which goes into producing an encyclopedia from the scholarly research of any other field.<p>- ""Wikipedia should do what encyclopedias do best: to wit, experts should conduct research to generate new primary sources or write books to generate new secondary sources."" I gave a long list of encyclopedia articles across several encyclopedias written by acknowledged experts on the specific topic. Traditional encyclopedias often ask experts to do this. Wikipedia is in the small minority.<p>- ""An encyclopedia is a survey of existing secondary sources"". I gave many examples where encyclopedias references the primary sources, and pointed to encyclopedia articles which are not a survey of existing sources.<p>- ""[Experts] shouldn't address the public by writing encyclopedia articles"". Excepting that experts <i>do</i> address the public by writing encyclopedia article, and have been for centuries.<p>- ""Encyclopedia articles are the worst way for them to address the public."" Excepting as Wikipedia shows, encyclopedias are often one of the first places people turn to for information, so it's a very <i>good</i> way to address the public.<p>- ""Experts shouldn't want to write encyclopedias."" Except that some encyclopedias are written by experts. Do you think the ""Encyclopedia of Magnetic Resonance"" was written by non-experts? (Hint: ""The existence of this large number of articles, written by experts in various fields, is enabling the publication of a series of EMR Handbooks on specific areas of NMR and MRI."")<p>Your statements are definitely contra-factual to how other encyclopedias work, as you make statements for which counter-examples are easily found. Your understanding of the goals and purpose of an encyclopedia seem based solely on your understanding of the goals, purpose, and operation of Wikipedia.<p>Do you have any evidence to back your claims? Otherwise I must conclude that you don't know what you are talking about.",1329361738

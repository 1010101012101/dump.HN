137436,comment,137358,137358,0,0,murrayh,,,"An interesting analysis. I agree that ideas are valuable, and after considering the issue, probably the only reason they have a market value of zero is because there is no good way to trade them.<p>I think you are on the right track with your proposed solution, but I think we can improve it:<p>Basically, ideas are interesting. If you publish ideas, a lot of people would go and read them. So there is your market. And you also note that the value of an idea decreases as it spreads, so that property can be leveraged to generate a competitive market.<p>So what you could do is generate the ideas and keep them exclusive. Someone can pay to look at an idea, and if they like the idea, they can buy it. If they don't buy, the idea gets released to the public.<p>I can see why this hasn't been attempted before, because there are some difficult issues that need to be dealt with. I do think that it could be done and made to work, so I might actually play around with this one and see what falls out. ambition, send an email if you'd like to play with me.",1205566289

As this technology progresses there may come a day when a single microphone is all it takes to record all tracks (and sub tracks of the individual instruments and vocals) of an entire band.<p>If this is the case, the cost of recording could go down significantly. Less equipment is necessary to record the multiple tracks, less time required to ""get it right,"" which in turn means less time to bill for by the recording studio.<p>How do you think this technology will change the music industry?",1205565519

137430,comment,137086,137386,0,0,skmurphy,,,"I think this point is overlooked by the article. There is a little too much of the ""Little Engine that Could"" which tends  to encourage entrepreneurs to ignore disconfirming data from prospects. For me, the key point is to decide what failure looks like before you start (and unexpected success, which for an entrepreneur signals that a product deserves more investment, potentially even third party investment in addition to re-directed internal resources) so that you know when to quit. I blogged about this in more detail (and with some good but long quotes from Peter Drucker) here: <a href=""http://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2007/05/25/seth-godins-book-the-dip-save-your-money/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2007/05/25/seth-godins-book-the...</a>",1205565091
137429,comment,137244,137244,0,0,skmurphy,,,"This is a great article. Key paragraphs for me:<p>It turns out that all that time spent playing make-believe actually helped children develop a critical cognitive skill called executive function. Executive function has a number of different elements, but a central one is the ability to self-regulate. Kids with good self-regulation are able to control their emotions and behavior, resist impulses, and exert self-control and discipline.<p>We know that children's capacity for self-regulation has diminished. A recent study replicated a study of self-regulation first done in the late 1940s, in which psychological researchers asked kids ages 3, 5 and 7 to do a number of exercises. One of those exercises included standing perfectly still without moving. The 3-year-olds couldn't stand still at all, the 5-year-olds could do it for about three minutes, and the 7-year-olds could stand pretty much as long as the researchers asked. In 2001, researchers repeated this experiment. But, psychologist Elena Bodrova at Mid-Continent Research for Education and Learning says, the results were very different.<p>""Today's 5-year-olds were acting at the level of 3-year-olds 60 years ago, and today's 7-year-olds were barely approaching the level of a 5-year-old 60 years ago,"" Bodrova explains. ""So the results were very sad.""",1205564945

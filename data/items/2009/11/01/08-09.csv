But that's about it.<p>This sort of testing would way more relevant, because it's a way of focusing on ""what (data) do we 'well' right now""?<p>I'm thinking that such sort of systems might be useful as a basis  for performance or concurrency testing for example.",1257065843

914871,comment,914742,914742,0,0,jbr,,,"I'm particularly interested in the idea of distribution/statistical-test driven software testing.  Instead of concrete assertions (truth assertions, equality assertions), we would make assertions about descriptive statistics or other tests.  Or just assert that if we do something stochastic N times, we should expect some truth/equality test to pass at least M times.<p>I'm not sure what to do with that idea, but that's actually the core of why I posted this.  Any other hackers out there excited by this idea?",1257065173

914861,comment,914742,914843,0,0,jbr,,,"My take: What I extracted from the talk regarding agile software development is his point about keeping specifics out of the code.  If the operational specifics of your application are kept in ""data form"" instead of precise a priori knowledge, it is easier to be ""agile"" (adaptive).  Agile is an incredibly loaded word, but I think he was referring to lightweight, working software that is easily adaptable.<p>As far as how it's software development: It's an architectural choice whether you're going to a) hardcode domain specifics into your code, b) keep some of the domain specifics out of the code, but neatly organized and structured, or c) leave the data messy but extract meaning from a large corpus statistically.",1257064195
914858,comment,914629,914770,0,0,mbreese,,,"I have to agree and disagree with this...<p>On one hand, it seems like the main open source software that comes out of Novell recently is Mono/.NET related.  So, regardless of how much other stuff they do, this is what they are known for.  So, if you like Mono, you'll love Novell.  If you hate Mono, you'll dislike Novell.  This doesn't seem to be much of a middle ground in this.<p>According to Wikipedia, his title is VP of Developer Platform.  So, his job isn't just to program, but to bring developers in.  But if he's ostracized a large group of developers with Mono, that can't be a good thing.<p>So yeah, he's not on the business side, but he is management... so making Novell profitable is part of the job description.  And the effectiveness of the strategy that Novell has taken since acquiring SuSE and Ximian is at least up for debate.  From an outside perspective, it does seem to be pretty rudderless.  Trying to merge the Ximian (GNOME) group with the SuSE (largely KDE-based) group is a pretty good example.<p>That's not to say that Mono hasn't brought in some business for Novell, but I'm not in a position to speculate on this one way or the other.<p>(This isn't to knock Mono or GNOME or anything else he's touched... I'm just looking at it from a strictly business point of view.  I'm pretty ambivalent on Mono, personally).",1257063745

914845,comment,914629,914751,0,0,gaius,,,"Indeed, I too remember when Netware was synonymous with LAN services for PCs (file, print, auth and directory). You could even run apps on your Netware servers using NLMs. But NLMs were tricky to write, and the OS gave you no modern features like memory protection; the game was over when MS released NT Advanced Server and NT 3.51 was the final nail in its coffin. All the aformentioned LAN services, plus SQL Server. Novell failed because they got complacent. Interestingly MS is going back to that now, Windows 2008 Server Core Edition is a command-line only version of Windows just for file and print...",1257062752

914843,comment,914742,914742,0,0,andrewpbrett,,,"It's a very interesting talk - but the title is misleading (title is the same in the submission as in the source). Norvig focuses on statistical learning and how that can be used to infer the meaning of words and the appropriate results in searches, particularly image searches. How these approaches tie into agile development, or any software development really, is given at best a cursory pass with a couple mentions that I, for one, wasn't able to follow. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop and it never did.<p>I'd love to be told that I'm wrong or that I'm missing something here, so if anyone wants to enlighten me on the connection, please go for it.",1257062610

You cant control demand in anything close to a reasonable way. Frankly people want drugs. Americans know this better than most since they had prohibition.<p>I have always wondered if some how it suits government to have violent criminals controlling the supply and money.

Not on this planet.<p>Corn grown in Iowa could feed 2 United States. So we make all sorts of other things out of it, or the govt pays folks (me for instance) to NOT grow corn and keep the price up.<p>At this point in history, with our current distribution system, biofuels can make money. In the future they will become more efficient, perhaps orders of magnitude more in ways we haven't thought of yet (oil-drop lenses on the leaves; kelp that fills its pods directly with waxy carbohydrate films; seeds that can be eaten OR converted to fuel etc).<p>The dumb thing would be to stop innovating now, because of FUD about imaginary issues.",1353765262

(Well, then we could say we're eating car emissions).<p>Unless you're converting oil directly into food (let's say carbohydrates), no, all energy from plants comes from solar energy.

We all know it's impossible to end drug trade. That's why most cities had this sort of ""understanding"" with the cartels. They move some stuff around, they leave the people alone and everything works out (e.g. Though Juarez had a lot of Drug related crimes before the ""war on drugs"", it was mostly contained, but still we had a lower than average rate for other types of crime like armed robbery and such).<p>But this wasn't about the wear on drugs, this was about territory: The local government had deals with the local cartel, but the Sinaloa cartel started fighting for more territory, allegedly with the aid of the army/federal police. Suddenly Juarez is impossible to live in, not because of all the narco murders but because federal agents and armies are stopping you every three blocks and suddenly you have a lot of blackmail, threats, etc coming from the guys that are supposedly there to protect. We knew they were not there to end the drug problem, they were there as a part of it, and we know it's impossible to end it, but it's better to have it out of sight, out of mind.<p>Now he's leaving and of course he had to come up with a conclusion like this. I just hope cities get back to the balance they had from before the war and this drug traffic problem stops spilling to the general population. As long as there is a market there will be someone to fill the need, and being the next door neighbor we're sadly in a good position to have those kinds of people.<p>Yes Mr. Caldern, it's impossible to end drug trade, you knew it, we knew it, this is not news... And yet you had us suffering in fear and crime for six years just because you wanted to help some buddies and look as if you were actually doing something.",1353765076

Their government would had to fight against the cartels, and might at some point win.<p>What you have then is a system where Mexico has much less criminality. They can't export to the US directly of course, but people will just buy drugs legally in the Mexican north and try to smuggle it the the US. The US can decide for themselves if they want to legalize it or not, and if they don't the US criminality is still there, but the Mexican criminality is gone.<p>Well what would likely happen then is another 1989 Panama. One of the main reasons why the US invaded Panama was its involvement in drug trade. So the US would criticize Mexico publicly, and at some point probably invade it.<p>It looks to me like current time Mexico is stuck between a rock and a hard place. They must be opposed to drugs because their powerful northern neighbor wants them to, but outside market pressure, from the very same neighbor at the same time destabilizes it.<p>So it's an issue that should be solved by an outside party - the US.

4825251,comment,4824410,4824410,2,0,tsahyt,,,"Personally I believe that in most applications, good performance is part of a good UX. 8 minutes of load time sounds like quite a lot but then again I don't know what application this is about and what's actually happening in those 8 minutes.<p>I'd say: If you've got spare time to work, make it quicker. It can never hurt. Then again, optimizing has become one of my hobbies anyway, I just like to knock off a few cycles here and there (I find that weirdly relaxing).<p>UX-wise the question is actually not whether it's truly fast, but whether it's ""reasonably quick"". What is reasonable here? If it's a very complex application, users <i>expect</i> it to load up longer. If it's notepad, nobody wants to wait for an hour for it to load. Or think about a 3D graphics engine. Nobody cares whether it runs at 100 or 150fps, as long as it doesn't go below 60 we're all fine.<p>On a sidenote I want to tell a story. A friend of mine has been hacking away on some Android ROM based on a modified MIUI and he noticed that it takes ages to install. So he had a look at the sources and found out that the original author had quite a weird way of installing stuff. Basically, what he did was copying the same files multiple times and deleting them again. He was just burning cycles. My friend wrote the author an email, asking why he's doing that. The answer was along the lines of ""It looks better if it takes longer"".",1353762441

Some comments here mention this is obvious or dated, but I think that in the wild a lot of devs aren't doing these things.<p>I think there are still a lot of back-end devs which this very much applies to. If you are a back-end dev who has been able to get away with not knowing CSS (and possibly even JS) well, then you need to fix that deficiency. For example, I typically work with a team of developers where I rarely have to touch CSS issues, but on my own projects, I get a lot of enjoyment on this, maybe because it's just a change.<p>Client side MVC is overkill in a lot of cases, but when doing client work you will come across these, so this is a good suggestion.<p>Optimization is something that can get left out if you have a dev team in which nobody picks up that piece. For me, I don't do things the client hasn't authorized payment for me to do and I'm generally busy enough that I hit those paid items and then I'm immediately switching to another project. Often my client is another developer who has pieced together a team. Nobody gets paid to do the optimization, maybe because the main developer is sloppy, lazy, or just doesn't know. It's just one of many details which should be covered but is often left out because of deadlines or a tight budget.",1353762236

8145560,comment,8145358,8145358,7,0,kevingadd,,,"Some interesting bits about this system and how it&#x27;s implemented:<p>Blocking is implemented using volume control in the flash player. The flash player has multiple bugs that currently undo the blocking.<p>Twitch already has an API used for playing VODs and streams on devices that don&#x27;t run Flash, and as a result of volume-control-based muting, muting does not apply to any of these devices (or software using the API, of which there is plenty).<p>Worse still, not only does muting not apply to the API, but ads don&#x27;t show up either. So muting will (at least in the short term) drive users to playback via API in order to avoid it, and coincidentally reduce ad impressions. Ideally Twitch will address this in the future by muting the actual VODs at the file level instead of in the player.<p>The Content ID detection database they&#x27;re using (from a third party, Audible Magic) includes many game soundtracks and other licensed pieces of audio that are used legally by actual games. Twitch calls this out in their announcement, so they knew it would be happening. As a result, VODs that merely contain playback of a real game end up muted - one of the examples going around the web right now is footage of Fallout 3, because FO3&#x27;s soundtrack contained some licensed songs from the 50s/60s that are in Audible Magic&#x27;s database. [3]<p>Suppressing copyrighted music from your streams is complicated further by the fact that the database is stated to contain ambient audio and not just music; many games do not have a separate volume slider for ambient audio, even if they have one for music. Suppressing that audio may require muting the game entirely.<p>Some games also tie licensed music into game-relevant content; Fallout 3 is one of them - the in-game radio has narration and dialogue from plot-relevant characters mixed in between the songs. Muting the audio or not using the in-game radio would actually hinder the experience of playing the game in a measurable way as a result.<p>Services like Audible Magic also have a long track record of asserting incorrect ownership for content. Many indie game developers & musicians were hit by an erroneous banwave as a result of this technology last year due to a shady service called TuneCore asserting ownership of music published by their customers - despite their customers not authorizing this behavior. [1]<p>Because Content ID takedowns on YouTube (and now Twitch) do not operate through the legal system or the DMCA hierarchy, there is no legal recourse available to content creators or rightsholders in this scenario, and the companies that have deals with YT/Twitch are free to siphon ad money or take down content whenever and wherever they like. With DMCA takedown notices there is a counter-notice mechanism, but since these content ID systems are based on private agreements between companies, no such mechanism exists.<p>The service twitch uses charges per-request for content identification so this likely influenced the decision to mute 30-minute blocks instead of at a smaller level of granularity. At the size of Twitch&#x27;s content database they may be paying a significant amount of money to Audible Magic for this service.

By performing one of these transformations, the compiler is free to generate much more efficient code.<p>(Technically, RTTI includes runtime type-based dispatch; e.g. object-oriented method calls.  I similarly avoid such code, preferring instead less-general mechanisms such as OCaml&#x27;s functors or Haskell&#x27;s type classes; both of which eliminate, or, in concert with existential types or first-class modules, make the overhead of RTTI explicit.

8145378,comment,8143844,8145058,6,0,Hamatti,,,"Let&#x27;s remember that the Codestarter is giving these laptops to kids who are basically just learning how to use computers.<p>1) I think Ubuntu is a great choice as the first Linux distro because of its popularity: that means there is a large community of people in the Internet who can help and there is already so much information written about different common issues one might encounter.<p>3) Because gaming is fun and Minecraft has shown its capabilities also as an educational platform so I feel it&#x27;s always better to provide a way of learning that is also fun. Kids learn by playing all the time and when we can slip in a few educational aspects into gaming, all the better.<p>4) I don&#x27;t think introducing things like C or functional languages would be doing such great things when teaching kids to learn to program. Yes, programming is much more than just &quot;stupid hello world programs and writing silly kiddie games&quot; but languages like Python and Ruby are completely valid choices for writing real stuff, especially in the web app world (think of Django and Ruby on Rails). Also, it is easier to get started with languages that provide things like REPL to play with without having to first learn how to compile stuff just to get basic stuff done. It lowers the barrier of entry.<p>5) I don&#x27;t think man pages are such great resource for people who are just learning stuff they have never dealt with before. They are really compact and even bit cryptic way of displaying the information (and not saying that is a bad thing, once you learn it, they are great, but it shouldn&#x27;t be a priority when learning programming).<p>6) I don&#x27;t know how often you have seen people try to start using vim or emacs? When people struggle even exiting an application, it&#x27;s not the most welcoming experience. Again, having editors like Sublime Text or Atom lowers the barrier to start doing because you can focus on the most important part - learning how to program - instead of wasting time to learn your tools, which you can do later.",1407366493

So, get a computer with built-in peripherals (a laptop), or only leave the ports unglued which you intend to use.<p>An old-fashioned keyboard and mouse port serves only one function; connecting a keyboard or a mouse. A USB port is general purpose. Since the latter is much more complex, we can expect its drivers to contain lot more vulnerabilities. If you expose your keyboard and mouse ports, and your USB ports, you&#x27;re vulnerable to all of the flaws in both. If you only expose your keyboard and mouse, you&#x27;re better off.<p>Its worth noting that none of this matters if you don&#x27;t use full-disk encryption.

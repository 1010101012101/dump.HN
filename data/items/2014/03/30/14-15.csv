7496315,comment,7494709,7496252,6,0,msandford,,,"Yeah I did, but the author seems to brush that aside and say &quot;it needs to be accounted for directly&quot; and I would argue that&#x27;s not necessarily true.<p>The problem is that I value my first gallon of water every day very highly for drinking.  The next gallon also pretty highly for drinking and brushing my teeth.  The next two gallons are for cooking and stuff, so they&#x27;re less precious; the next five gallons for bathing and sanitation; the next 10 for cleaning and washing, etc.  All the way down until we get to the market price which in Houston for water that comes out of the tap is $0.01 per gallon.<p>I think it would be utterly exhausting to list out every subjective value that I place on every thing that I exchange for every transaction of every day.  It&#x27;s something that I can do in my head with very little effort since for many transactions the value/cost delta is high and I don&#x27;t need to do careful accounting.<p>One of the great things about money is that it has basically zero transaction cost as compared to bartering which has a substantial either time cost to find the best price, or price cost to find a deal in a short period of time.  Engaging in these kinds of nonlinear transactions (if they need to be done honestly) would bring an economy to its knees.",1396191585

7496305,comment,7495875,7496120,3,0,ryandrake,,,"I think just about every software company I&#x27;ve worked for exhibited most, if not all, of these traits. Two in particular:<p>Urgency<p>I&#x27;ve observed, on several occasions, at multiple companies, senior managers talking openly about deliberately instilling &quot;a sense of constant urgency&quot; into the team. I don&#x27;t know if we were perceived as unmotivated (we were) or if there was some external threat coming that warranted urgency (debatable), or whether management just picked up on the &quot;a sense of urgency&quot; phrase from some HBS article (probably). Either way, the end result was this kind of &quot;forced urgency&quot; with motivational speeches about how we should all feel urgency about the company&#x27;s success, and that every task assigned to everyone was always an emergency. Needless to say, it was a great place to work.<p>Reaction Mode<p>I&#x27;ve worked at very few software companies that seemed to have an actual long term plan AND were willing to stick to it. It&#x27;s easier to &quot;just do what the customers are asking for today and then change to do what they are asking for tomorrow&quot;. I&#x27;ve worked at companies that pretended to be selling a product, when, in reality, nobody wanted their product as-is and they would get roped into constantly doing custom engineering for VIP customers (bonus: every customer was a VIP customer). So, while the team would be ostensibly working on improving their core product, in reality, they were adding buzzers and lights that had little to do with the core function of the product, in order to react to what one or two customers wanted. The recent &quot;agile&quot; craze has not helped in this regard.",1396191489
7496304,comment,7494870,7495457,4,0,cowsandmilk,,,"> And it would have all never happened had they just locked their doors to begin with.<p>This is an attitude that ruins communities. As a nonscholarly example, I like to run ~5 in the morning. Sometimes, something is off in my pre-run snack and I have to go to the bathroom. For a long time, public bathrooms along the esplanade in Boston would be unlocked at all hours. In modern times, due to attitudes like yours, they get locked at 8 PM and unlocked around 8 AM. So, there are no longer public bathrooms available for me to use, just because I like to run before work. (On a side note, I&#x27;ve talked to other runners who have the same issue. Some of them have been put in situations where physical necessity resulted in taking a dump right outside the door of a closed public bathroom. I&#x27;m quite sure this was not the intention of locking these doors)<p>Another case is the Harvard library. You are required to have a Harvard id to enter the library. This is in stark contrast to what makes libraries hugely valuable to other communities. I&#x27;ve regularly had collaborations with Harvard that didn&#x27;t rise to the point where I obtained a Harvard id, so I would need to drag my host along to the library to quickly look up some material in a book. It is incredibly frustrating.<p>Tightened security spends a vast majority of its time quelling desired behavior while spending very little time actually disrupting undesired behavior.",1396191486

7496302,comment,7494239,7495247,1,0,mjn,,,"> He or she would be living in one of the nice cities, surrounded by people with similar values and education, enjoying quality-of-life metrics that are significantly higher than the broader American averages.<p>Where would that be, though? I&#x27;ve lived in a few cities (Atlanta, Houston, Chicago, L.A. area, S.F. area), and even though I lived in relatively nice <i>areas</i> of those cities, I wouldn&#x27;t say any of them are nice <i>cities</i> full-stop. For one thing none of the urbanized areas are actually particularly safe, unless you are <i>very</i> careful where you walk (and if you drive, careful where you park your car). I lived in Midtown Atlanta for years, and it certainly wasn&#x27;t; you had to only take one street a few blocks in the wrong direction to go from $1m houses and $2k/mo lofts to &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t walk there alone after dark&quot;.<p>You can run into those issues in Europe as well, but mostly in &quot;poorer&quot; cities. The amount of care you have to take walking around Chicago or Atlanta, taking note of which streets and neighborhoods are safe and which aren&#x27;t, feels more the kind of caution you need to exercise in Istanbul, Sofia, or Athens, rather than Copenhagen, Frankfurt, or Brussels.<p>In practice I find most upper-middle-class-and-wealthier Americans just don&#x27;t walk anywhere, especially not after dark. That is a way of mitigating the issue, but leads to a different lifestyle. In my opinion, a lower-quality-of-life one, though many Americans genuinely seem to like the car-centric lifestyle, so that may not be others&#x27; opinion. One place America <i>does</i> excel is if you like suburban living. But I don&#x27;t think it does cities nearly as well as it does suburbs.",1396191459

I would bet that HN regulars include very few of the worlds experts on tech subjects; for the most part the world&#x27;s experts are too busy to hang around on a web forum to chat. That&#x27;s what makes them experts: focus and hard work.<p>Which leads to my second point of concern, which is thinking that a person&#x27;s HN &quot;reputation&quot; means anything beyond HN. I would be very surprised if it does. Speaking of bitcoin, it seems to me that the generally accepted experts tend to be people with a deep history of working on crypto currencies, or at least a deep history with bitcoin specifically.<p>I&#x27;ve been participating, moderating, and in a few cases researching forum communities for about 15 years. It&#x27;s easy to fake expertise; just make sure all your comments and posts are well-researched and fact checked before posting. That&#x27;s not the same thing as being an actual expert--it&#x27;s the difference between a Ph.D. in physics and an undergrad writing a research paper. No matter how accurate and readable their paper is, the undergrad is not an expert. And forums tend to disproportionately reward readability, humor, and writing style, over substance.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to criticize your posts or expertise specifically; I don&#x27;t know either well enough to comment.

Synthesise all the dates onto a single planner. Work out the order of priorities.<p>2) Make a time plan for the week and try to stick to it. The plan <i>must</i> include breaks and (at least) a day off a week. Do things with other people in the day off and at certain times of day like meals.<p>3) Get topic lists for each module and check them off as you study those topics.<p>4) Find other people at about your &#x27;level&#x27; of confidence in each module and try to buddy up with them for study periods in the library...<p>5) ...find a place to <i>study</i> that isn&#x27;t your own room/house/wherever. Libraries can be good, as you <i>have</i> to get work done, but somewhere else helps as long as it is away from where you sleep (&c).<p>6) Reduce friction to getting started. Keep notes, study guides, any equipment and textbooks for each module organised. Pop them into your bag as you go off to the study location. Pack the night before if possible. Put the bookmarks to module Websites on your Web-browser tool bar. Use a password manager so you don&#x27;t even need to authenticate.<p>7) Google The Pomodoro Method for the actual study time. The author has gone commercial now but there are summaries. Its easy.<p>Any good?<p>EDIT: 8) At the end of each study day, prepare the stuff you need for tomorrow. Try to find an easy task on whatever is on the time plan that will get you started (the Hemingway strategy).",1396190450

Assuming this was a fair trade (that dollars and burgers are of approximately equal value), then as a result of the transaction we&#x27;ve simply rearranged who has which good, and no additional value was created in the process. What I&#x27;ve lost you&#x27;ve gained and vice versa, so that the total value between us has not changed after the exchange is over.&quot;<p>I can see how a person would think that, but it&#x27;s not really correct.  If that was true then nobody would have any reason to hold either dollars or burgers or whatever; we&#x27;d constantly trade them for one another since they are of literally equal value.  Who cares which $10 bill they have in their wallet?  Nobody since $10 is $10 is $10.  Hell, most people don&#x27;t even care if it&#x27;s $10 or 2x $5 or $5 and 5x $1, so long as they don&#x27;t need singles for the vending machine.<p>But we don&#x27;t see that kind of behavior in the economy, which leads us to the conclusion that when people exchange things they&#x27;re not exchanging things of equal value.  They are of nominally equal value, which leads to there being a price.  But if they were truly of equal value then the guy selling a burger is making $0 profit (something he is unlikely to do) and the guy buying a burger technically isn&#x27;t any better off either.  Why would two people make an exchange where neither is better off?  In aggregate they wouldn&#x27;t even if there are some exceptional cases where they would.<p>When people exchange things they are trading something which subjectively to them is of equal or lesser value than the thing they are getting.  That also explains why people buy just one burger instead of ALL the burgers.  When someone is hungry it shifts their subjective valuation of burgers higher and money lower; once satisfied their preferences shift back to &quot;normal&quot; and they stop buying burgers.<p>An economy already has value creation &quot;baked in&quot; because when people exchange things they only do so when it increases total satisfaction.  People tend not to make trades which decrease satisfaction or merely hold it equal.  The transaction cost helps ensure that is the case.<p>Everything else equal before the trade satisfaction was X, after the trade it was X + Y.  Y is the amount of increased satisfaction that prompted one or both parties to engage in the trade.  Now obviously someone could argue that Y is negative but that doesn&#x27;t hold water.  People don&#x27;t buy things that are &quot;too expensive&quot; or &quot;crappy&quot; or whatever you&#x27;d like to call it.<p>I will concede that my argument might seem tautological.  I might even agree.  In the absence of a third party with a gun I can&#x27;t see how or why two people would choose to enter into a trade that don&#x27;t benefit at least one of them, and probably both.",1396190156

And so is oxygen.  My sincere hope, however, is that you now understand that this is probably the wrong question to be asking.  The better question is probably “What dose of sugar can I (or my child) safely tolerate to avoid chronic toxicity?”  The goal should be to figure out your toxic dose, then stay well below it.  (It’s probably not wise to consume 95% of the toxic dose of APAP just because you have a really bad headache.) What makes this important, of course, is that with water and oxygen, the toxic doses are so far out of the range of what we normally consume, it’s not really necessary to expend much mental energy worrying about the toxicity.  But with sugar, at least for many of us, the toxic dose is easy to consume, especially in world where sugar resides in almost everything we eat.&quot;",1396190081

There&#x27;s plenty of people out there storing large amounts of data and getting no valuable conclusions out of it. But the fact that many people will fail doesn&#x27;t mean the concept is not worth pursuing.<p>Chasing what is cool is a pretty dangerous impulse.

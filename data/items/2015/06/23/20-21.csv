Sure, the integration is nice, but I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s different from most other IDEs. But what struck me as a bit odd was the presenter stating a preference for vim, and then starting to edit Objective-C like all you&#x27;ve got is your cursor keys plus tab.<p>So, yes, another IDE, yay. And if you work at FB, sure, mindshare alone is probably worth it. But why would one give up normal mode/macros/elisp/abbrevs etc. for that?<p>Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I totally understand different preferences, and if your current editor is e.g. TextMate/Sublime or an IDE like PhpStorm/Eclipse/Xcode, I can see it.

Emphasizing creativity would work for an extra couple of decades at most, so there&#x27;s no sense in building, say, brand new educational institutions around it. Check out the N.Y. Times article announcing the creation of the Camp Fire Girls (co-invented by Gulick, a co-inventor of basketball) - there was a panic then about automation and the problem was not solved, it has just been continually deferred as the pace of change increasingly wreaks havoc on our ability to prepare children for adulthood. When the buzzwords of today&#x27;s companies are &quot;innovation&quot; and &quot;disruption&quot;, you may translate them to &quot;unpredictability&quot;, &quot;chaos&quot;, and &quot;social insecurity&quot;. No one even tries to design to rightfully earn a place in a human being&#x27;s short life cycle - Silicon Valley designers often enough end up making dopamine squirrels for poor toddlers on touch screens. The designers then heed warnings against giving their own children screens, ban TV&#x27;s in the home, and send the kids to an unplugged school. Fewer are able to escape the swathe of the indefatigueable machine. Have we made some thing more clever than ourselves? Yes and no, but the no shrinks.\nPerhaps instead some could follow Kant&#x27;s idea of treating humans solely as ends, never as means, a sort of human-centered chauvinism or &quot;humanism&quot;. Or one can conclude that if machines lack human flaws, and out perform homo sapiens at their supposed virtues, they deserve the future. \nNew genders, new sexualities, new body images, these might get some attention economy for a few, but they must be rewarded by a mass of bored, a creativity economy is the fame and long tail economy we already have. The assimilation of new distinctiveness will approach instantaneousness. And computers can be reformatted much more easily because they have no &quot;self&quot; to worry about or reinforce.",1435092915

Are there constraints you would prefer on one or the other? What amount of time spent qualifying for a single job is too much?<p>I personally pushed to make our interview process more centered around a take-home style assignment, as I feel it&#x27;s a much better approximation of programming skills than an in-person, high stress whiteboarding session, or a quiz on some programming trivia. We try to keep the assignment tightly constrained (&quot;Here&#x27;s a broken app with x requirements.

It&#x27;s a step on the path to enlightenment.<p>• Ruby: a language; now also a VM. Its language semantics can exist on other VMs and people still consider that &quot;Ruby&quot;; nobody really uses the VM outside of the language. So, we call Ruby a language. However, its language semantics require a lot of the VM (the ability to redefine methods of existing classes, for example), so one could say Ruby has its own Abstract Machine that a lot of VMs just happen to be adequate implementations of already.<p>• Erlang: a language, <i>and</i> a VM (itself called BEAM.) The VM&#x27;s semantics are the important part; the language is just an arbitrary syntax. Other languages on the BEAM VM (or rather, the Erlang Abstract Machine, which the BEAM VM implements) all &quot;taste&quot; very strongly like Erlang, because the flavour of Erlang comes from the VM, not the language. (And then &quot;OTP&quot; is the operating system for that VM. You could write your own, but I&#x27;m not sure anyone has. All the current BEAM VM languages assume they&#x27;re running inside OTP.)<p>• C, C++, Rust: different languages, all for the same Abstract Machine, which has no real name but assumes a &quot;C Runtime&quot; with POSIX-like abstractions is available. You could call it the &quot;C Abstract Machine&quot;: it&#x27;s the effective assumptions of hardware instruction-set that allow one to talk about things like &quot;signed pointer-length integers&quot;. When something hits &quot;undefined behaviour&quot; in one of these languages, it&#x27;s behavior undefined <i>by the C Abstract Machine</i>—likely because different ISAs do different things and it&#x27;s too costly to try to smooth that over. (Note that the POSIX abstractions could be said to be an &quot;abstract operating system&quot; of sorts, one which is implemented by multiple different real C-AM operating systems.)<p>• Smalltalk: its own syntax, its own OS, and its own VM. All three are just known as &quot;Smalltalk&quot; in general, with the name of the implementation prefixed. Simple!<p>• Java, C#: languages that created VMs (the JVM and the CLR) that are now more important than those languages. The JVM has no operating system, just a bunch of libraries. The CLR has an implicit dependency on a lot of Windows to be its operating system; Mono and Wine have a weird relationship because of this.<p>• Lua: a language. The actual VM is irrelevant (there are multiple), though the &quot;Lua abstract machine&quot; has the interesting requirement of being an embeddable sandbox. No operating system; everything inside the VM comes in along with the application.<p>• JavaScript: a language that spawned an abstract machine with three choices of operating system: a very small one (Node), a very large one (the browser runtime), and one in the middle (Macromedia Flash.) Node-Webkit and Electron are examples of a non-embedded instance of the JavaScript abstract machine running the browser OS.",1435090789

9767487,comment,9764498,9767332,0,0,waxymonkeyfrog,,,"Hi Falcolas, this is Derek Thompson, the author of the piece.<p>1. The quick answer is that we don&#x27;t know how much of the misery of not working is from the financial shortfall of unemployment, vs the failure to meet a cultural expectation to work, vs some inherent need to feel productive, because it&#x27;s just very hard to tease out the difference in reliable studies. How, eg, would you test this for prime-age adults at a time when income is tied to work and there is a cultural expectation that everybody work?<p>That said, my best guess is that about half of the psychological misery of losing a job and being unemployed comes from the non-money stuff, like being bored and failing to meet a cultural expectation to work. (This is distinct from people who choose to stay home with kids, who have chosen to immerse themselves in an essential activity and often feel great pride -- and stress! -- in these jobs, even though they&#x27;re not compensated with income). As I said in the piece:<p>&quot;The post-workists argue that Americans work so hard because their culture has conditioned them to feel guilty when they are not being productive, and that this guilt will fade as work ceases to be the norm. This might prove true, but it’s an untestable hypothesis. When I asked Hunnicutt what sort of modern community most resembles his ideal of a post-work society, he admitted, “I’m not sure that such a place exists.”&quot;<p>2. The fact that unemployed men seem to be <i>less social overall</i> suggests to me that their rise in leisure is about more than the daytime unavailability of peers. Because otherwise, wouldn&#x27;t they just go drinking with buddies every night? This suggests, to me, some shame of being unemployed that leads to self-imposed isolation. In any case, the misery of unemployment suggests that we&#x27;re just not very good, as a culture (and particularly men), at finding non-screen-based things to do with our time when work goes away.<p>3. Crime has fallen by A LOT in the last few decades so I didn&#x27;t want to go too deep into predicting a rise in crime at a time when violent crime seems to be in structural decline. That said, for young, less educated black men, there are a variety of barriers to their participation  in the labor force including racist bosses not wanting to hire them, an abundance of low-paying service sector jobs that seem feminine (they&#x27;re in health care, government, and education), and the cultural and economic allure of the black market and gangs in some areas. This is a really short summary, but I think the allure of gangs and crime is very complicated.<p>4. One of the biggest differences between 1977 and today is certainly the decline in crime. Crime didn&#x27;t spike during the Great Recession, surprisingly.<p>5. I thought that&#x27;s what the piece was about! :) But seriously, the section labeled Government: The Visible Hand tries to address this question (or at least this question as I understand it) head on.",1435090669

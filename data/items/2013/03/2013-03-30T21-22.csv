5466792,comment,5466545,5466545,3,0,A1kmm,,,"The problem with the theory around mid-range--jobs is that people with a non-zero t can compete for jobs as well - for example, they may have increased their skill level through training, volunteer work, formal education, or there could be a flood of skilled workers following layoffs at a competitor. A skilled employee is therefore potentially competing both against 'green' replacements and skilled replacements.<p>At times when there is a surplus of skilled employees, the market price for skilled employees will tend towards the marginal cost of living for skilled employees, which is roughly the same as the costs of new employees, and so new employees would be prevented from gaining experience on the job (they could offer to work for less than their cost of living in the hope of a future payoff from their skills, but even that won't necessarily make sense to the employer, because the employer has costs per employee beyond just wages and employee benefits, and it might still be cheaper to hire fewer skilled employees at a higher price than to incur more per-employee costs hiring more unskilled employees at a lower rate). On the job learning therefore becomes less relevant, and new employees are forced to overcome the activation costs through other means, or try a different industry. If there is no credible alternative to on the job learning, this might cause a dynamic effect where the attrition of skilled employees combined with an absence of trained new employees raises the skilled employee price towards the utility to the employer, and makes it cost-effective to take on new employees again.",1364680361

Google's mission is to organize the world's information, to give you the best answer to questions, not to send you to ""the best site"". Sometimes the best answer is a site, sometimes it isn't. Very few users want a search engine that sends them to a linkfarm or another search engine, they want answers in the fewest number of steps. If I ask what the weather is, I want a temperature and immediate forecast, I don't want to have to click through to Weather.com and initiate another 2 dozen HTTP requests for extra resources to get the answer, especially for mobile. I'll click through to another site if I want an extended 5 or 10 day forecast, or I want something beyond factual data.<p>Since Knowledge Graph was introduced, there are now millions of queries that don't even show any ads at all.

5466785,comment,5466545,5466545,15,0,nhashem,,,"Most jobs are selling your time in exchange for money.  If your time is mostly fungible compared to someone else's time (ie. most low-skill labor), then I'd say all the algebraic equations expressed in the OP are true.  He is essentially modeling supply/demand curves of typical scenarios involving ""human capital.""<p>In the past, the value of human capital -- the amount you got paid for selling your time for money -- used to be more lucrative.  At one point nearly half of Americans were in a labor union, which artificially constrained the supply of human capital so it would be worth more.  Conversely, our previous industrial revolutions required a great deal of human capital (building factories, sewers, etc), generating lots of demand that would keep the value of human capital high.  Due to political and technological changes, this is basically no longer the case.<p>If you're a software engineer, then none of these models apply to you because you are <i>high-skill</i> labor (also sometimes called ""talent."")  You're paid for your time, but your productivity can be orders of magnitude higher than your pay.  In the OP's ""expendability of labor"" graph, the ""sweet spot"" is enormous.  In my nearly ten years as a software engineer, I've seen colleagues laid off/fired for all sorts of reasons, but <i>none of them</i> were due to, ""well we did the math, and we decided your production is not worth your salary.""  I've seen layoffs where the executives <i>literally admitted</i> they would make less revenue/profits due to the lost productivity of the laid off workers not offsetting the savings in salary, but they had to hit a certain ""profit percentage"" or some other absurd reason that justified the layoffs.<p>In any event -- I've thought a lot about the macro-society impact of this new model of economy, if we're truly destined for a world where human capital is just not that valuable.  My interest in politics and healthcare has largely been based on this -- what should we consider ""subsistence living,"" and what happens if we reach an inflection point where most jobs paying for human capital are below it?<p>It's possible, of course, that this will all be moot, and our next industrial revolution will have a huge demand for locally-based human capital (e.g. a ""renewable energy industrial revolution scenario,"" where there is a huge demand for laborers that can install solar panels on houses, or something), and the median income for Americans will increase.  Or it's possible for a more gradual shift to happen (e.g. the graying of the baby boomers causes a gradual increase in demand for local caretakers of the elderly).  But I'm not sure it's a good idea to just assume that will happen.",1364680175

5466763,comment,5465033,5465155,3,0,topologix,,,"Disclaimer: I have written a few academic papers based on persistent homology and co-founded a company which uses it.<p>Persistent Homology was invented to deal with noise (even though nothing that deals with data is ever IMMUNE to noise). The basic idea is to pick out/discern the topological features (betti numbers) which persist over a range of one or more parameters. Let's take the simple case of single parameter persistence (call it epsilon). Say that we are given a set of N points equipped with a distance function (i.e. given any two points, we can compute a distance between them (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance)</a>). Now, construct a structure comprised of sets of varying lenghts (a set with a single point in it is called a vertex or a 0-simplex, a set with two points in it is called an edge or a 1-simplex, a set with three points in it is called a triangle or 2-simplex and so on.). Given a fixed epsilon, we will: 
	1. draw an edge (1-simplex) between all pairs of points which are within epsilon of each other. 
	2. draw a triangle (2-simplex) comprising of all triples of points which are within epsilon of each other (note that three points can have edges between all pairs without 'filling out' the triangle)
	3. draw a tetrahedron (3-simplex) comprising of all sets of four points which are within epsilon of each other (remember the note from the previous point)
	4. and so on..<p>Now given this set of simplices for a fixed epsilon, we can compute the number of holes of various dimensions, this gives us a fixed set of betti numbers.<p>Persistent Homology allows one to study the evolution of this complex as epsilon increases.<p>The trick about noise : if the features are 'short lived' (i.e. they existed for a short range of epsilon), they are likely noisy. The reason why persistent homology is great is because it identifies the topological features and produces a measure for how long they survive.<p>I made an example video showing persistence homology in action for a simple 3D dataset (sampled from a torus). Check it out here: 
	<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKfUzmznd9g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKfUzmznd9g</a>
Notice that in this video there are three long lines in the left frame. The first corresponds to betti-0 (there is a single connected component). The second two correspond to betti-1 (there are two loops on a torus). The third corresponds to betti-2 (there is a singe empty space within the torus).",1364679838

Now this fact alone may not be enough to conclude that based on these ratios that it is the cause of such a change in quality of women. But from another perspective it makes sense. In Los Angeles and in California, there are less women. This means that women have a much larger pool of men that they can choose, so they can afford to be picky. This means that the proportion of good looking, successful men using online dating increases since there aren't enough women in the local area to date. Now New  York on the other hand, the advantage is for men as there are more women and they can be picky.

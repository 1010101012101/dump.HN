3240187,story,,,1,0,mrkmcknz,"Why SOPA could change the UK tech scene.",,"I've been taking a strong stance against SOPA despite being based in the UK. Mainly because I have intentions to relocate to the US as soon as I my passport would allow me to.<p>However the passing of SOPA would change the UK tech scene greatly and for the good at that.<p>As it currently stands immigrants in the tech world will often decide that if relocating, the US is the best choice. You have the Bay, Boulder, NY and maybe even LA whereas we have Cambridge and London. Both of which are behind their US counterparts, gaining momentum if you listen to the UK commentators but this is simply in parallel to the US scene.<p>The passing off this bill will create a shift in momentum, it will peg the US behind greatly in the long term picture. (Of course it will remain a powerhouse in consumer spending and the UK won't get near touching that.) However in terms of protection and a legal advantage the UK will be more attractive. (Berlin is yet to catch the UK in the same way the UK is behind the US. But is a noteworthy mention.)<p>All it takes is one significant component of the US startup Eco-structure to focus more on the UK and the change will start to take shape. Of course that Eco-structure wasn't built in one year and it will not be broken in one year. (VC's will probably be the first to relocate focus due to the fact most have a presence here in the UK.)<p>This bill won't change anything for Facebook, Youtube and Twitter as we know. It will change the companies that aren't yet taking shape; the companies the next generation see as cool and hip.<p>(I'm not a expert on the SOPA bill in any shape or form, or the US political system at that.)<p>americancensorship.org",1321390740

This is by no means comprehensive, just what I've learned from working at companies so far that have larger-scale apps<p>- modularize, use SOA architecture (making modules accessible via a service call so that they can be run on different servers, if necessary), this enables parts of an app that receive heavy use to be clustered separately (as part of an app may be very critical but another module may be able to go down for a few min without causing a major problem, the main reasoning for this is to save on the cost of clustering the entire app)<p>- avoid holding state in singleton objects, this way no extra code has to be written to synchronize them among different nodes running the same module<p>- use session locking, so that a user's session is locked to a specific node in a cluster (this enabls ease of saving state for that specific user as they remain on one node throughout their entire session)<p>- use a database abstraction framework with caching (such as JPA), this enables automated synchronization of the cached data among nodes",1321390703

For example, there is the Univalent Foundations of mathematics proposed by Vladimir Veovodsky. This reduces logic, set theory, category theory (actually groupoids) and higher abstractions to homotopy theory (well, certain explicit constructions in such anyway) which is then modelled in Martin-Lf type theory.<p>By the Curry-Howard isomorphism there is a correspondence between types and proofs (specifically types in the simply typed lambda calculus and proofs in the intuitionistic logic or if you add dependent types, then also predicate logic).<p>The real difference is that functions in type theory are computable, whereas functions in mathematics (based on sets) need not be.",1321390702
3240180,comment,3239732,3240048,8,0,tghw,,,"I haven't listened to the podcast, but it sounds like one of the biggest nits they picked was that ""Isaacson asserts that Apple did not use NeXT for the basis of OS X"". Looking back through the book, I can't find that assertion, but I can find the following, at location 6379 of the Kindle version (the Kindle app tells me it's page 366):<p>""At the January 2000 Macworld in San Francisco, Jobs rolled out the new Macintosh operating system, OSX, which used some of the software that Apple had bought from NeXT three years earlier. It was fitting, and not entirely coincidental, that he was willing to incorporate himself back at Apple at the same moment as the NeXT OS was incorporated into Apples. Avie Tevanian had taken the UNIX-related Mach kernel of the NeXT operating system and turned it into the Mac OS kernel, known as Darwin. It offered protected memory, advanced networking, and preemptive multitasking. It was precisely what the Macintosh needed, and it would be the foundation of the Mac OS henceforth. Some critics, including Bill Gates, noted that Apple ended up not adopting the entire NeXT operating system. Theres some truth to that, because Apple decided not to leap into a completely new system but instead to evolve the existing one. Application software written for the old Macintosh system was generally compatible with or easy to port to the new one, and a Mac user who upgraded would notice a lot of new features but not a whole new interface.""<p>Reading that, it seems to me he got it right, except for misspelling ""OS X"".",1321390673

3240171,comment,3238521,3238521,4,0,T-hawk,,,"Very cool of course.<p>Why do the avenue lines meet at an antipode?  In Manhattan, they are parallel, they don't converge.<p>I understand the difference between latitude and longitude lines.  A meridian of longitude is a great circle centered at the Earth's center; a line of latitude is a small circle (the analogue of a chord in a 2D circle on a plane) whose center lies north or south of the Earth's center in three dimensions.  Longitude lines divide a sphere like slices of an orange, converging at poles; latitude lines divide a sphere like a tomato slicer and do not converge.<p>There's actually two ""poles""; aside from the one in Uzbekistan that everyone is seeing, there's another in the South Pacific Ocean at the antipodal point from Uzbekistan.  So the avenues are being treated as meridian lines; great circles.  Would it be more accurate to extrapolate avenues as parallel small circles?<p>We could test this theory by inspecting whether Manhattan's actual grid respects the curvature of the Earth.  If the avenues are closer together at the northern end of the island, then the avenues actually do behave as meridians.  If not, then the extrapolated avenue lines should be small circles and would not converge.  You'd still have a pole in Uzbekistan, where the last street becomes an arbitrarily small circle, but just one avenue line through it.  (I gotta run at the moment but will throw some trigonometry at this later.)",1321390539

3240159,comment,3239732,3239732,3,0,dinde,,,"My main complaint from the book is that Isaacson injects his own opinion too strongly and too often. He writes it like a novel, with him guiding us to the conclusions he has prepared for us. Instead I would have preferred it be written like a well-written wikipedia entry, with numerous sources presented and the reader being granted the freedom to come to his own conclusions. This bothered me much more than any technical inaccuracies.<p>I think this touches on a larger social issue. I believe that the younger generation is more sensitive to being manipulated about what to think and feel. Before the internet, we relied on experts to present us with the facts and the conclusions; there is now greater awareness that there are always multiple sides to any story, and we prefer hearing all of them before making up our minds.<p>As an example, I recently watched an investigative journaling television show with my parents about the dangers of laser eye correction. I was struck by how unaware they were of the different methods that were being used in the show to guide their opinions (music, poor-quality hidden cameras, etc). To me, I wasn't given nearly enough objective facts to come to any sort of conclusion, but to my parents, the conclusions presented by the experts were enough.<p>Isaacson writes like an expert, but we don't want an expert, we want a fact-gatherer.",1321390405

Which part are you specifically worried the most about?<p>> With this information, (if I'm not wrong) it wouldn't take long to simply DDoS Siri...<p>This is just scaremongering. Knowing an IP address is enough to DDoS a server. Are you suggesting that it's somehow unethical to independently publish the location of a publicly-available server? Are you also going to indict the DNS server that gave it to them?<p>> Or port Siri to Android (effectively stealing IP).<p>Theft relates to physical property. I'm not sure what would be stolen here as Apple still controls the Siri server and requires a unique iPhone 4S ID to be used. Again, though, reverse engineering for the purpose of interoperability is legal in the United States. There's no way to frame this as stealing.<p>> (I have no bias either way, just pointing out, if someone figured out how to reverse engineer dropbox, so you could use their space, without a dropbox account, would we all be going ""wow, this is so cool!"" or would we be crying out ""this is such an irresponsible hack!"")<p>This is a red herring. Your proposed situation suggest a security vulnerability of some kind wherein Dropbox hypothetically allowed someone access without paying. No such vulnerability to Siri was found; all requests to the Siri server were made using a valid phone id and returned valid, official responses.<p>The only thing that's unclear to me is if the anti-circumvention portion of the DMCA extends to technology used but not created by the author e.g. Apple did not create SSL but they use it to secure transmission - does this make spoofing an SSL certificate an instance where the DMCA's anti-circumvention law would come into play?",1321389407

3240050,comment,3239732,3239961,-1,0,nirvana,,,"False Dichotomy.  Isaacson didn't present ""all sides"", he only presented one side, which was his uninformed and ignorant opinion.  Often he would quote Steve saying something and then say ""but that's a lie"" or ""that's the reality distortion field talking"", or ""even Steve seems to believe the reality distortion field"", as if he (Isaacson's) opinion of the truth was sacrosanct and what Steve (The guy who was present for the events) was saying was obviously false because Steve is ""well known"" to have a ""reality distortion field"".  At best, Isaacson quotes people who are uninformed or being dishonest in ""proving"" that Jobs is wrong-- most hilarious example was quoting Bill Gates claiming that none of NeXTSTEP made it into OS X.  Apparently Isaacson wasn't aware enough hot the issues to realize how absurd that claim is.<p>IF the book had presented all sides, say, quoted Steve, and then Bill Atkinson and Andy Hertzfeld on an issue and then gotten Woz's or Raskin's opinion of who was right, and Steve, Bill and Andy disagreed in what they said, and the reader was given the opportunity to decide for themselves what the truth was... then that would be ""presenting all sides.""  However, I can not think of a single incident where  Isaacson quoted more than one person, and in most cases he just asserts that Steve is lying.<p>The truth is, there is no ""Reality Distortion Field"".  The term itself is a joke.  The claim that Steve can get away with lying is a piece of propaganda that has ben perpetuated for decades by Apple haters. (and they have to, because the people who hate Apple are jealous because Apple produces better products, they can't really bash Apple for being better, so they have to resort to smears.)<p>I've paid close attention, and in every case of Steve Jobs saying something that people claimed was a lie, I've yet to find one where he publicly tells a flat out lie.  He's been wrong in his opinions, but that's quite different than lying.<p>For instance, he was quoted as saying that ""people don't read anymore""... haters claim this means that he claimed Apple would never make a kindle competitor, but that's not what he said.  He identified a core problem that the kindle, and later Apple, were trying to solve.  That's not a lie-- people don't read anymore, compared to how much they used to read in the past.<p>People lying about Steve Jobs-- as Isaacson does-- does not change the facts about what Steve Jobs said and did.<p>I know that's the strategy.  For decades haters have been lying about the PARC visit, and claiming that Apple ""Stole"" from PARC.  They simply ignore the fact that Apple got a license agreement from Xerox, paid Xerox in pre-IPO Apple shares, and that the whole thing was on the up and up.  They feel that if they just repeat this lie, over and over, and in every context, even when places where it isn't relevant, they win every argument.  In fact, it has gotten to the point where some apple haters really are completely ignorant-- they've just heard the lie that Apple stole the GUI from Xerox (impossible since there was no GUI at Xerox at the time, in fact) enough time that they think they can repeat it and not be held accountable.  Here on Hacker News, one actually said to me ""Its widely accepted that Apple stole the GUI from Xerox, why do you even bother disputing this fact?""  .... when it is not a fact at all.<p>Now these same people are spreading the lie that Google is Open while Apple is closed. Truth:  Both Apple and Google release the operating system as open source, and both Apple and Google keep as closed source the application layer where their proprietary apps live.  For Apple, that's the UI, for google that's the Google Apps.   The Lie: Touch screens have existed for years before the iPhone:  The truth: Multi-touch is a new, non-obvious, and very innovative invention.<p>You can't change reality be repeating a bunch of lies over and over and over and over and over.... but you can make a lot of uninformed people believe it.  And that's the goal.<p>Unfortunately, Isaacson's book perpetrates many of these lies, despite having access to the sources of truth.<p>I don't think Isaacson is an Apple hater... I just think that he felt there was more profits for himself by feeding the myth of Steve Jobs, rather than biographying the real Steve Jobs.<p>Edit: Whoops.

As soon as things get remotely technical, the book begins to fall a part. He misquoted Bill Gates as saying that the problem with the NeXT computer was that the optical drive had too low latency. Either Gates didn't say this and Isaacson got it backwards because he doesn't know any better, or Gates had a momentary slip of the tongue that Isaacson should have known enough about to correct.<p>Isaacson asserts that Apple did not use NeXT for the basis of OS X, which is just patently false (Isaacson also refers to OS X as OSX). He claims that Apple evolved the existing Mac OS into something NeXT like. The truth is that Apple took the NeXTStep operating system and added some classic Mac OS APIs and features to it. OS X wasn't a complete break from the past, but it's entire core and its Cocoa API (and objective-C) are pure NeXT.<p>Because Isaacson doesn't understand this distinction, he completely glosses over the importance of OS X to Apple's revival. Without OS X, Apple would probably be dead today or maybe just making portable music players. Classic Mac OS was not going to cut it and it was falling behind Windows.<p>Classic Mac OS was significantly worse than NT-based Windows OSes, and would have been completely crushed by XP. OS X, on the other hand, provided a viable alternative to XP and it successors. Apple has gained market share because of OS X and how good of a modern OS it is. The Classic Mac OS was about to sink the entire company.<p>There are plenty of other examples like this in the book. Isaacson also doesn't ask many followup questions or do in-depth research. The best researched parts of the book are the beginnings chapters which are based on previous books by other authors.<p>This is a good biography for people not that into technology, but for anyone remotely interested in the technology, it's not that good.

3240013,comment,3238124,3239084,12,0,grellas,,,"Excellent comment. Any appeal to Congress that disrespects the value of copyright will not fly because, as the general public sees it, it is a serious problem when people have the value of their creative efforts diminished as they are spread across the web without compensation. The DMCA was never intended to protect infringers. It was designed to ensure that ISPs did not get caught in the cross-fire as copyright holders sought to protect their interests against those who did infringe. To do that, the ISPs had to abide by certain rules aimed at protecting copyright holders and their reward for doing this was to get ""safe harbor"" protection that shielded them from liability for the infringements that did occur on their sites. SOPA seeks to rip those protections away by effectively removing that shield. It also allows for what amounts to the creation of blacklists that will force search engines to ban allegedly transgressing sites from public view. All in all, then, it gives to the copyright holders (and to the Justice Department) a set of tools that will enable them to attack the websites directly for the infringements of others. In essence, this flips the DMCA on its head. Whereas DMCA nurtured the growth of the web by shielding innocent conveyers of information from liability as long as they played by the rules, SOPA (should it pass) will inhibit any such growth going forward by giving lawsuits and legal proceedings a central place in the copyright enforcement scheme across the web. This is why fledgling startups will be vulnerable to getting killed off before they can realize their potential: the copyright police will be there to shut them down before they can even develop proper systems for SOPA-style compliance. In other words, the issues here concern primarily the burden of litigation and whether, as a matter of public policy, people who have legitimate rights (copyright holders) should be given broad latitude to sue intermediate parties over what usually are infringements or whether they should be restricted in their right to impose liability on such intermediate parties, thereby giving such parties the room to breathe and to grow as companies and to further the information goals of the web itself. This is an important policy debate, and the people on the other side of it are not innately evil in arguing their case. I think they are wrong, very wrong, and that the consequences of what they are trying to do will be highly detrimental, as a matter of policy, to the future growth of the web. But it is important that the opposition to this not be centered on <i>ad hominem</i> attacks. That only detracts from the strength of the case to be made for internet freedom and growth and does indeed allow the opposition to dismiss bona fide complaints by casting SOPA opponents as people who are not focused rightly on the serious issues involved in this debate.",1321388663

3239935,comment,3238880,3239631,6,0,jedbrown,,,"""Check cards"", or whatever name is used for bank cards that you can use as a credit card (instead of only with a PIN) are unequivocally a worse deal for consumers. You don't get any of the benefits (cash back/miles, insurance, etc) and in the case of fraud, the money is gone until the claim is processed. The physical form (card) is irrelevant, but it will be very hard for any system to compete with rewards credit cards. Since the card companies do not allow the merchants to pass on the fees to the consumer, unless you can make a system so pervasive that merchants can afford to _not_ accept credit cards, I don't see how you can compete on the basis of low fees. You have to give at least 1% back to the consumer (more to get people to switch), and then you have only removed a tiny bit from the status quo. The people who subsidize the rewards cards, those who carry a balance, probably aren't interested in a system that doesn't offer credit.",1321387829

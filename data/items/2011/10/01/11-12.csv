In such organisations, huge effort is spent constantly redesigning and tweaking software, for little obvious gain. It is action for action's sake.<p>Not long ago I worked on a contract with a big media company in the UK. During the whole three months I worked there, the company was working on what was a stopgap redesign of the website. By stopgap I mean, this was a design that was to appear between the current design and the ""proper"" redesign that was still being drawn up.<p>In truth, the ""proper"" design being drawn up will probably be just another stop gap. So I was probably working on a stopgap design between two other stop gap designs.<p>Funny thing is that everyone knew that having a stopgap design was a ludicrous idea but no-one had the power to prevent it happening.<p>I think this happens because big companies end up with big design and development teams. They can't easily get rid of these teams and it isn't acceptable to leave such a huge team idly doing nothing. So instead they set them to work on adding ever more features to the product.<p>A much better option, of course, would be to set them to work on a completely new product.",1317468832

I think the advance from the disconnected dumb home microcomputer of 1985 to the globally connected iPad of today is comparable to the advance from the telegraph to television. I think it's easy to underestimate how far we've come when you've lived through the change. The salience of the contrast over time is lost, because you're too close to it, and the change seems almost imperceptible; recognizing how far we've come needs some perspective.<p>It's true that humanity is less in the game of building pyramids, dramatic edifices of might to be looked upon in wonder, but I suspect much of that was grandstanding in a global cold war, rather than driven by need or even a genuine striving for achievement. Our focus has moved in a more democratic, consumer-oriented place, where it is simultaneously less visible as a monument, but where its leverage, the number of lives it affects, is higher than ever.<p>Space exploration doesn't make a whole lot of economic sense, until there are resources beyond our planet for which the demand exceeds supply such that the price level justifies the effort. I don't have any romantic fantasies of travelling across the galaxy, much less universe; without FTL technology (which will probably never exist) or greatly lengthened human lifetimes, it isn't realistic to focus on it. If it was really necessary to go to the moon again, I'm confident it could be done much more cheaply and safely than it was last time, but I wouldn't vote for public funds to be spent on it.",1317468616

It's fun to slice-and-dice a large Java code base using Eclipse, and to leave it tidier than you found it. I like the way that basic cleanup operations are fast and safe enough to do while browsing code.<p>But I maintain some large, older Rails projects in Emacs, too. And personally, I'd rather maintain a slightly hackish Rails 2.3 application than a typical Java application. Why?<p>- Rails has rigid conventions for database tables, model classes and controllers. Even in a strange app, the structure is familiar.<p>- The Rails application will generally express the same ideas using <i>far</i> less code. I can dive in, figure out everything that's going on, fix it, and get out. In Java, I often have to dig through various facade classes, gratuitous design patterns, and parallel class hierarchies. Maintenance is cheaper when the fugly evil all fits on one page.<p>- The Rails world is in love with cute libraries that (for example) reduce an entire application's access control to 20 lines of code. Even if I don't know the library, I can learn it, and then I've only got 20 lines of code to think about.<p>Mind you, I keep hearing about fancy new Java frameworks, so I suppose the Java world is getting better. And a truly awful Rails application—especially one without unit tests—can be a Lovecraftian horror.<p>But in the real world of at least semi-competent teams, it's possible to understand both Elicpse+Java and (Rails|Python)+(Emacs|vim|shiny Mac editor), and still choose the later, even if you're a maintenance programmer.",1317468191

They are outliers, they'd be productive in whatever. That's not where IDEs do anything, instead you should look at average programmers in average companies with large codebases. That's where IDEs shine, because they can analyze large amounts of other people's code and hint you and guide you in the right directions when interfacing with it, without forcing you to read all of it.<p>Another improvement IDEs offer, especially when doing Java in Eclipse, is that you're always in a compiled state, and any errors in your code are highlighted while you write. You don't have to ""context switch"" to another mode where you run a compiler to check what you just written for syntax errors and other errors, and then bring that information back with you when you switch back to editing. It's all there, all the time, which increases your productivity, because it decreases the time you spend on fixing small errors, spelling errors, syntax errors, etc.<p>In short, when I meet a developer that rejects IDEs, I have suspicions that he may be a grumpy old programmer that just refuses to go outside his comfort zone.<p>I don't see a difference between someone rejecting a newer better language to stick with one they know, and someone rejecting a newer better IDE to stick with an environment they know.",1317468007

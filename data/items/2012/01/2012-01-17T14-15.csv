Money is an extremely effective campaign tool, so effective that it is almost impossible for a candidate with no money to get elected, no matter how popular their views are.

The promise of a high-paying job after congress, along with other benefits, influences the decisions of our elected officials.<p>To make politicians accountable to their constituents, we have to solve the first problem.

They're going to come from pushing data into a Hadoop cluster to process it. Collecting data that would otherwise be impossible to collect because it's either unstructured or there is simply too much to put in a RDBMS at a cost effective scale.<p>Hadoop and the NoSQL movement is exciting when you start to think about processing that data and pulling what's useful back out into your existing infrastructure.",1326811006

Not at first, anyways.  Text-book publishers will continue to charge what they think the market will bear.  They will completely ignore the fact that the cost of text-books is often spread over several students and several years via the used book market.  With no used print editions available and perfect reproductions of texts available for ""free"", students will turn to piracy in droves.  Then the publishers will blame the platform for encouraging piracy.  This might not happen if publishers recognize that digital editions, if priced cheaply enough, might still bring in the same amount of revenue since every student is now forced to buy a new version of the text.  I'm not hopeful that this will happen though.<p>Many subjects have text-books whose position in the universal cannon is unchallenged.  They're so good, so well respected, or the competition so poor that practically everyone uses them to teach.  Other subjects have no real cannon text-books because no single text has managed to distinguish itself.  Other subjects are simply obscure or esoteric enough that professors tend to take a DIY approach to the course text, with wildly varying results.  In any subject without an established canon text, a suite of digital text-book creation tools could be a great boon to writers.  DIY texts that prove good enough to have broad appeal will face greatly reduced barriers to wider use.  Of course, when you can deliver text-books to profs for the price of an email's bandwidth, it's going to become very hard to choose good course texts!  Content creation tools are a great thing, but I hope somebody out there is working on content filtering tools for text-books too!",1326810532

Dubbed by many as fertility tourism,surrogacy in India is a popular choice for couples from industrialized nations because of the much lower costs involved in renting a womb,flexibility, Surrogacy Success Rate and minimal regulation for taking the child back to there country. Statistics indicate that Indian surrogacy clinics handled around 1,500 surrogacy births for domestic and overseas couples in 2010. This indicates a jump of 50 percent in the last two years.Low cost of surrogacy acts as a magnet for people looking for surrogacy to complete their families.<p>Surrogacy clinics and doctors in India have been helping many childless couples, single people, and gay couples to have the chance of becoming parents. The demand for gestational surrogacy in India is rising as more and more people from different parts of the world travel here, hoping to get new additions in their family.<p>Experts in India have worked with many couples from around the globe in recent years, and they make all efforts to see that the India surrogacy journey is a pleasant experience for their clients. Their strict surrogate selection process and excellent healthcare during the pregnancy stage make an Indian surrogate mother an excellent choice to carry a baby.<p>Apart from Best specialist for treatment of IVF, IVF ICSI,There are many people globally who actually come to India for other easy and economical option for baby.That is Egg donation and Surrogacy option.<p>Surrogate Mother Selection Process:<p>Surrogate moms in India are selected very rigidly. They have to undergo several test and counselling. The screening includes factors like age, Pregnancy history,Over-all health history,Personal background,educational level and the looks.The surrogate mother has to undergo Several tests conducted by doctors and laboratory technicians in order to determine their suitability. Tests include Physical and medical examinations, Psychological and psychiatric tests and Screening of STDs and infectious diseases.<p>Reason why India is becoming popular choice for surrogacy:<p>1]
The most important reason for India surrogacy as having emerged as a popular choice is the low expenditure involved. India surrogacy clinics charge roughly a third of the price compared to a surrogacy procedure in the industrialized countries of the West. India has a robust fertility tourism industry.<p>2]
Indian surrogacy clinics have become more professional in the last few years,not only in the medical procedures involved but also in the hiring of surrogate mothers in India.Since English is widely spoken in India,Communication barriers are minimal.Indian hospitals that offer surrogacy employ good medical practices for the surrogacy process and are equipped with the latest technology.<p>3]
Surrogacy services in India have proved to be more successful than their counterparts in U.S.A and Europe. Surrogacy services in India are the second most common location for gestational surrogacy since the 2007 figures from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology revealed 276 successful gestational surrogate pregnancies in the U.S. and 150 successful gestational pregnancies in Indias clinics. Indian womens are less exposed to drugs, alcohol and smoking and hence the chances of having a healthy baby through a surrogate mother in India are better.English is widely spoken in India. Communication barriers are minimal in India.<p>4]
Surrogacy laws in India are much lenient as compared to other countries.<p>Since commercial surrogacy is recognized as legal by the government of India, the process of having a surrogate baby in India is quite simple.<p>So Many people globally are now choosing India a destination for Surrogacy.Simple reasons like:Surrogacy Treatment is Economical In India,Best Of IVF Doctor,Easy to find Surrogate Mother In India,Legal Aspect of Surrogacy as law are in favour of the Intended parents going for surrogacy treatment.<p>Under the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research,surrogate mothers sign away their rights to any children.The new surrogacy laws in India give utmost importance to the privacy of the couple which wishes to have a surrogate baby in India.As of now, there are no laws in India restricting a gay couple from coming to India and hiring a surrogate mother to have a baby.<p>With the growth of surrogacy services in this Asian country, more and more people are flocking to India to avail the surrogacy services.India surrogacy clinics continue to attract thousands of visitors to the country every year who visit the country in the hope of achieving parenthood.<p>Dont miss the journey of the parenthood and start packing your bags to achieve the feel of being a proud parent.

The e-ink display is the ""solution"" to the eye strain (among other things) that come with reading on a backlit display. So to suggest that is the goal seems to be as if we are going backwards.",1326809926

3474946,comment,3474440,3474851,6,0,jnbiche,,,"I'm not sure that any book on the NLTK, even one written specifically for developers, could avoid the concepts you're referring to. These terms and concepts are inherent to the study of natural language processing.  So while I agree that there are a significant number of NLP-related terms used, I think that has less to do with the book's audience and more to do with the book's subject matter.  And the use of computational linguistic terminology is not gratuitous -- it's important to learn the jargon so you can look for the right type of help when you don't know how to do something.<p>On the flip side, the Python in the book is fairly straightforward, so developers should be able to dive right in with the code.  In fact, experienced developers will probably find themselves skipping over many sections that are essentially lessons on Python.<p>Overall, this book is a good introduction to NLP and NLTK.  That said, if you're at all familiar with NLP, you'd probably do just as well to dive right in and start working with the toolkit.  NLTK is very well-documented and easy to work with. It's also amazingly complete -- tokenizers, stemmers, POS taggers, classifers, etc. etc etc.  It also includes a number of algorithms that commonly fall under ML, data mining, and IR.  If you work with Python and do any kind of work with unstructured text, you need to check NLTK out.",1326809847

For private education loans, you'll need to contact your lenders for details.<p>With that amount of loans, I'm assuming you maxed out your federal loans (which happens around $120k -- maybe a little north of that because of capitalized interest) and the remainder is in private loans.  I don't know a whole lot about private loans, but, as far as federal loans, if you're making $50k with $120k in loans, you're certainly going to qualify for reduced payments, which will at least ease the monthly burden on you.  You'll need to talk to your loan servicer, but, since the payments on income-based plans are based on a strict percentage of income (IIRC, 15% of your gross income is the max), based on the info you've provided, I don't see any problem whatsoever with you qualifying.<p>With your debt and income numbers, if you take a reduced payment schedule, you might end up with a payment less than the interest on the loan, which means you essentially never make progress toward paying it off.  However, if you have this type of financial hardship for the next 25 years, your federal loans will be forgiven.<p>Now, if you work in a public interest-type job, there's the possibility you can qualify to have these federal loans forgiven in 10 years instead of 25 on the income-based plans.  You'll need to contact your loan servicer for details on that.<p>Finally, because interest rates are essentially as low as they can get on federal student loans, you're going to be well-served by obtaining a federal student loan consolidation.  Contact either your loan servicer or the William D. Ford Direct Loan program (<a href=""http://www.loanconsolidation.ed.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loanconsolidation.ed.gov/</a>) for details on consolidation.<p>This information came from three years experience at a company that consolidated federal student loans.  I can also recommend the site finaid.org if you have any questions I haven't answered.  I haven't read every word of every page there, but what I have read seems spot on.  Specifically, you might find the following page to be of interest to you: <a href=""http://www.finaid.org/loans/publicservice.phtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.finaid.org/loans/publicservice.phtml</a> .<p>I hope this helped a little.

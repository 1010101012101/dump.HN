The condition has two main parts: obsessions and compulsions.<p>>> Obsessions are unwelcome thoughts, images, urges or doubts that repeatedly appear in your mind; for example, thinking that you have been contaminated by dirt and germs, or experiencing a sudden urge to hurt someone.<p>>> These obsessions are often frightening or seem so horrible that you can’t share them with others. The obsession interrupts your other thoughts and makes you feel very anxious.<p>[...]<p>>> Compulsions are repetitive activities that you feel you have to do. This could be something like repeatedly checking a door to make sure it is locked or repeating a specific phrase in your head to prevent harm coming to a loved one.<p>>> The aim of a compulsion is to try and deal with the distress caused by the obsessive thoughts and relieve the anxiety you are feeling. However, the process of repeating these compulsions is often distressing and any relief you feel is often short-lived.",1451598371

Transmitting from the Sahara to the places where the load is gets you to rather large resistive losses.<p>Also, there are generation losses. A traditional heliostat boiler + turbine will get you about 15-20% effficiency. then you have to shunt the waste heat somewhere in a place with very little fresh water. Oops.

Similarly, when an algorithm decides if a patient needs an emergency operation or if they can wait, why can we expect an simple explanation especially for the patient with rare conditions when algorithm again must perform an inference, not a deduction from 1000 very similar cases?",1451597422

That 5,400 hours has another implication: Amortized over the life of the machine, even a $3,000 laptop will only cost ≈50 cents per hour. That makes me extremely insensitive to price. I simply want whatever works best.[1]<p>As peatfreak said, research won&#x27;t guarantee satisfaction. The only way to really know if a piece of hardware will work for you is to actually use it. That&#x27;s one huge advantage of Apple (and now Microsoft) products: I can walk into a store and test the hardware/software combo. In just a few minutes, I can tell if the it lacks the annoyances in my list[2].

This may result in a doctor giving two identical receipts for medication - and because the two patients are insured at different companies, they get different generics with all the problems this causes (e.g. different colors of the pills, leading to lower stick-through rate because patients mistrust changes, or different composition leading to different absorption rate even though the medical compound is identical).<p>There&#x27;s a shitload of money wasted in healthcare, not only in the US, and the poorest people (as always) have to suffer.",1451596194

First, it has always been assumed that the states have the power to provide for the welfare of their citizens, as well as to police their behavior and morals. The states are, in that regard, decidedly not &quot;limited governments&quot; of &quot;enumerated powers.&quot; State-level universal healthcare is contrary to no founding principle.<p>Second, the Commerce Clause was incorporated into the Constitution to allow the federal government to solve what we today would recognize as economic collective action or free-rider problems. At the time it was aimed to address the collective action problem of free trade. It&#x27;s good for the United States as a whole, but individual states have a short-term incentive to erect trade barriers. The purpose of the Commerce Clause was to allow the federal government to counter-act those short term incentives. Precisely the same problem exists with state-level universal healthcare. Even if most people in a state want it, they can&#x27;t enact it because it&#x27;s too easy for people from neighboring states to free-ride on those services. The Commerce Clause is thus properly invoked for resolving that problem at the federal level.",1451596170

If you had been actually using this to bet you might have given up on the tuned model around Dec. 7th when draw down was at its worst.<p>What will really be interesting is whether the performance over the rest of the season continues to diverge in the current direction or if the performance tends float up and down around the break even line.<p>Is one of the parameters a progress through the season index?

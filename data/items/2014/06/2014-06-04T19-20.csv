There is no safe option - as the article clearly points out.<p>In any case - if you wanted to make the safe decision, why did you put your kid in the car in the first place? Don&#x27;t you realize how dangerous it is to drive on the roads? Ask yourself - which is safer - Your child spending 5 minutes alone in a car with a window cracked open on a cool day - or 5 minutes driving to that place, with oncoming traffic that with the slightest lapse of attention by a driver could have their car crashing into yours in a second.<p>This is the madness of this whole situation - people have left common sense at the door.",1401911984

Here&#x27;s some tips:\n#1: Create a Unique Name\nNow I know this sounds dumb and obvious, but creating a name that sounds to similar to something else in that realm is just not a good idea.\n#2: Make it either really abstract, or having an element of what you&#x27;re doing in it. Microsoft has the word &quot;soft&quot; or software in there. Apple, on the other hand, is completely abstract. Both have been successful.\n#3: Make it short. You probably don&#x27;t want it to be 2 words or having a hyphen in there. Less than 10 characters is preferable.\n#4: Make it rememberable. Branding is everything, and generic names like &quot;Beats&quot; and &quot;Apple&quot; have been really successful nowadays. Also, knockoffs of real words are cool too. Think of a bicycle making startup named &quot;Byke&quot;.<p>As for actually coming up with names, I find it actually works best to:\n#1 Think about it throughout the day, no matter what you&#x27;re doing.\nand #2 Sleep on it.\n#3 Oh, and think about it in the shower too :P<p>I hope that helped!",1401911882

During early stage development, you can&#x27;t afford to optimize too heavily for technical debt, especially since some features may be thrown out or re-written entirely, but a lot of technical debt is avoidable, and can be mitigated with a few simple practices.

We have a large codebase, and I need to be able to understand code I have not touched in months at a moments notice.<p>2. Modularize. Even if something is being thrown together quickly, I make future-me happy by keeping things as modular as possible from the outset.

I wanted to see if Swift could make the implementation easier to read, more elegant, etc. While the original is hardly a thing of beauty, I thought it still might be useful to see how business logic to perform the same task might differ between the two languages.<p>I hope people who take a look, fork the repo, download and play with the code will enjoy reading through it and maybe take it as a taste of how things might be done (or not done) in the future.",1401911480

This can also be training for them on using machine learning for their problem solving.<p>The goal isn&#x27;t necessarily to totally supplant data scientists (love press sensationalism), but to help enable companies to build easy to use models in their apps.<p>This can also map to saving data scientists time by not necessarily &quot;skipping&quot; the feature extraction part (which they can with deep learning and still do reasonably well) but allowing them to just use a fairly good machine learning model out of the box to use as a baseline.<p>The great thing about machine learning is the ability to mix different techniques.

7847542,comment,7847161,7847161,1,0,withdavidli,,,"My take on the matter.<p>- Incentives \nThere are inherent risks that people will be recommending a lot of candidates. This is not a bad thing, especially if they are candidates that aren&#x27;t easily reachable (inboxes overflowing from recruiters / passive candidates / little social media presence), but attend events and are much more open to speaking with fellow engineers (better technical understanding and what day to day life is).<p>Candidates still have to pass the interview process so there is still Quality Control. The person who referred the candidate is not allowed to be an interviewer for that candidate. This is to remove personal bias and mis-aligned incentives.<p>>By offering bonuses in this way, companies essentially turn their employees into part-time contingency recruiters who now face the same bad incentives of their full-time counterparts.<p>Don&#x27;t understand why this is inherently bad. The worse ideas often come to mind about recruiters, not without merit, but think about what it takes to be a great recruiter. Consistently presenting highly qualified candidates and building a relationship of trust with the hiring team. It&#x27;s like any business, it can be poor customer service and retain no one, or great customer service and have loyal repeat customers.<p>- Contacts In The Hands Of HR<p>This is well deserved criticism. People fall through the cracks for a lot of reasons. The biggest one is probably handling too many :reqs(can be 40+ at one time)/hiring managers/candidates. A lesser heard reason, but probably happens a lot, the recruiter leaves the company and a lot of information gets lost. Recruiting is a highly contigent based department. Most companies do strictly contract or contract to hire. Recruitment in itself is a high turnover profession.<p>- Paying For Contact List<p>If the recruiting department is doing their job, most of that list will already be in the system. So companies will have to figure out an efficient pay out structure, also with so many people in the same circles, de-duplicating lists. An introduction is worth so much more than a list.<p>EDIT:<p>Important Point: It is up to a companie&#x27;s current employee if they feel comfortable recommending someone or allowing their recruiting team to go over their contacts. DO NOT ALIENATE YOUR EMPLOYEES!! They can either be your biggest advocates or biggest detractors. In my opinion, retention is even more important than active hiring.",1401909563

Can we be certain\nthat the <i>author</i> knows if he/she is being sarcastic?) --- then how can\na we program a machine to tell the difference?<p>On the other hand, if we can agree on some rules for what we might more\nlikely consider to be sarcastic, it isn&#x27;t entirely impossible that that\nalgorithm can use so much data to draw its conclusions, that it would in\neffect be impossible for a human to verify -- because a human doesn&#x27;t\nhave infinite time. Or in other words: it&#x27;s not inconceivable that we\ncould create a system, that ends up being better at telling sarcasm from\nhonest opinion than humans are.

It&#x27;s far more of a rounding error than your money.<p>The electorate is full of easily-swayed morons, and they&#x27;re the ones who get a voice, not us. If you want to affect policy, then you need to sway them harder than your opponents.<p>The last Presidential election involved a bit over $2 billion in campaign spending. That&#x27;s about $20 for each person who voted in the election. If you can spend more than $20, then you can get a greater voice through money than through voting. Congressional races involve less money and are thus even more easily affected.<p>It&#x27;s not a great way to run things, but there&#x27;s not much use in wishing they were different.<p>Edit: I also want to point out that voting with your money allows you to express a more precise position. In voting directly, you have few options. For the last Presidential election, the only sentiments you could really express with your vote were, &quot;I favor half-assed health care reform and an extreme overemphasis on combating terrorism in both domestic and foreign policy&quot;, &quot;I favor a slightly different half-assed health care reform and an extreme overemphasis on combating terrorism in both domestic and foreign policy&quot;, &quot;I am a complete nutcase&quot;, or &quot;I hate them all&quot;.

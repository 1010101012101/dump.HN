5655917,comment,5655075,5655501,4,0,flebron,,,"As an aside, trees (Red-Black trees for std::map in libstdc++) have terrible locality, and thus cache behavior. In general, for reasonable n, it's even going to be better to have a vector<vector<int>> in which you literally push to each vector (for amortized O(1) each time) when you find an adjacency. In the case of dense graphs, yes, adjacency matrices will be even better, since you're going to pay the size cost anyway, and you may as well do it up front and not pay the resizing charges.<p>From my experience, using vector<list<int>> behaves more poorly due to terrible locality of lists. My use of red-black trees for graphs is mostly limited to implementing Dijkstra using set<pair<cost, node_index>> as a queue, since the priority_queue in <queue> does not have a DecreaseKey operation. Using that set (and some map (needn't be std::map, could well be a vector) of node_index to cost for faster compare during Dijkstra's neighbor loop) can make for a very fast, short, and easy to implement Dijkstra.<p>My usage is mostly competitive programming, so YMMV.",1367693793

By allowing writers to transfer their copyrights to publishers, publishers could (a) aggregate a number of entries into a new type of work and (b) produce new editions of that work without having to submit to extortionate negotiating situations with writers who could use their control of one (possibly unchanged) part of the work to block development of the rest.<p>This principle underlies the genesis of the extensively collaborative forms of expression that defined culture in the 20th century, from recorded symphonies, to radio plays, televised broadcasts, and or course, the cinema. Indeed, it creates an entirely new class of authors (e.g. cinematographers and film editors) whose own work depends on massively collaborative forms of creation.<p>There are many, many reasons to be critical of the copyright system.

SilkRoad is not rent seeking because they are not looking to change or increase the transaction friction and regulatory control of the drug trade for their own benefit.  That is why rent-seeking is usually used to describe entities trying to create a government policy which benefits them but hinders mutual exchange of others.

That is, unfortunately, not quite true in regards to Tor. Iran has on multiple occasions done/tried out doing (turned it on, then off) traffic censorship that directly or indirectly very much affected Tor. [1] [2] True, Tor managed to roll out obfsfroxy et al., which they'd been already actively developing prior to that, but if e.g. Iran (again) attempted country-wise generic SSL censorship, that would hurt things. Tor's pluggable transports would perhaps be a response to that still, but Iran's gov't could move on to other things.<p>With China it's even worse, as it seems there is custom software being used from within China to actively discover and censor out new Tor bridges (as in, a new one is used by someone, some minutes later another connection from China comes in to it, speaks Tor protocol, disconnects, and then the bridge is blocked.)

They don't even use Objective-C, they use their own framework for widgets built on WM called ""WINGs.""<p>There's still activity on the GNUstep front. Just a few things I can think of,<p>- Their runtime, libobjc2, has done a great job keeping pace with Clang and modern Objective-C. It now has a Cmake based build system and doesn't require any bootstrapping with GNUstep-make.<p>- GNUstep-base (the Foundation alternative) is solid, though some parts go back as far as OS X 10.6 and others OS X 10.4. You'll have to check the headers to see what's up to date. They do have an extremely capable implementation of distributed objects, last I heard they were planning to make it integrate with Apple's distributed objects implementation, but that project still seems to be pending.<p>- GNUstep-gui (AppKit alternative) just added support for 10.6's NSCollectionView very recently. Most activity there has been in the form of refinements. As I recall, drag and drop is still on their todo list... they really could use some manpower there.<p>- GNUstep-back (the backend renderer) still uses an API that's largely based on Display Postscript. They are planning to pitch a GSoC project to replace the Display Postscript API with one based on GNUstep-Opal (a Core Graphics alternative), and they already have a largely proof of concept Core Animation alternative running on it (GNUstep-QuartzCore.)<p>The project's current vision is to focus on making it easier to port Objective-C to other platforms, rather than to be a desktop environment. But like most small, mature open source projects, there's a lack of manpower keeping them from easily achieving those goals. Would be nice to see more activity there, in the future.<p>You can check out all of the projects I've named in the Github mirror at <a href=""https://github.com/gnustep"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gnustep</a> , but don't expect them to be responsive to pull requests. The mailing lists at <a href=""http://gnustep.org/information/gethelp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gnustep.org/information/gethelp.html</a> are strongly preferred.<p>As for the current website, I think Scott Stevenson designed it a decade ago long before he joined Apple.

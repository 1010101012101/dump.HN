730184,comment,729837,729931,0,0,grellas,,,"An unpaid developer normally cannot sue for copyright infringement, even when the work has not been paid for (unless the contract explicitly states that the IP rights transfer <i>only</i> upon payment, which few contracts do).<p>The problem here is that the underlying contract was not done as a work for hire. Because of this, <i>even if the contractor had been fully paid</i>, all the startup would have obtained as a result of the development effort would have been a license to use the work product as contemplated by the contract. Such a license would normally not have included a right to modify the work without the permission of the copyright owner (i.e., the original contractor).<p>Thus, the startup put itself in a horrible legal bind, not from its failure to pay as such (though this obviously inflamed the situation so as to bring on a lawsuit), but from its failure to have a work-for-hire agreement in place when it commissioned the work.<p>Even without an immediate lawsuit, the underlying problem would <i>not</i> have gone away. Imagine VCs doing their due diligence for a funding after this work had been done and discovering that a major piece of the IP used in the company's business had been done under a contract that did not give rights in that IP to the company (this would be apparent to a trained lawyer simply from examining the face of the contract). In such a case, unless the startup were able to get a release from the contractor, the startup would still face the threat of an infringement claim whenever it attempted to modify this code without the original developer's consent. Thus, without a release from that developer, funding would still have been impeded and likely blocked.<p>Even with the lawsuit as filed, it appears that the startup has obtained only a temporary reprieve when the judge denied the application for the <i>preliminary</i> injunction. That denial is based on a judge's assessment of the contractor's likelihood of success on the merits of his claims and on weighing equities of what is fair to do pending a full trial on the merits. Thus, while the company squeaked by this phase, a cloud still hangs over its future depending on what eventually happens at the time this thing comes up for a real trial. This cloud is a clear deterrent to investors putting money into such a company.<p>In practical terms, this scenario is mutual self-destruct for the contractor and for the startup unless they settle up, which means they likely will.",1248881888

In other words, if you sacrifice a day job to take the time to start your startup, you do not have financial stability to support your family.  If you keep the day job, however, then you don't have enough time for your startup.<p>YC-type funding in this case would probably help a little, assuming you have some cushioning elsewhere, e.g. savings, live with family, etc.<p>Then again, I bet there are probably founders out there that started their project on the side and slowly grew into a startup.",1248881119

Fortunately, I haven't been sick. But I have gone to the doctor a few times over the past few years for routine checkups/physicals. Actually, I did go once when I had a terrible bronchial infection that I just couldn't seem to kick even after a few weeks. My doctor gave me a bunch of free asthma inhalers when she heard I was self-employed. The next year I got a free flu shot and didn't get sick. This was important because had I gotten the flu it would have ended up in a huge amount of lost productivity on the project I was working on and possibly resulted in public failure for the stakeholders involved (we were constantly catching up the whole way). Although to be fair, not getting the flu may have been coincidence as the flu shot prevented a strain that was not prevalent this year. Flu  vaccine manufacturers always have to guess which strain they think will be dominant and target it.<p>The routine physicals have led to me getting back into shape. My doctor also did some blood work and discussed some changes I needed to make in my diet to reduce the risk of developing some conditions that afflict other family members. This is a major benefit of having a family doctor that everyone goes to. When your other family members aren't insured and consequently don't see a doctor, your doctor doesn't have as complete perspective of potential risks to your health. Incidentally, I'm now earning more and contributing more to taxes, so I feel like the money spent on covering my healthcare was a worthwhile investment. And no, I didn't have to wait 6 months for a physical, I waited precisely 9 days for the next schedule window that was convenient for me. The flu shot was a walk-in procedure when I had an empty patch in my schedule.<p>Healthcare shouldn't only be about tending to urgent matters. Not getting your yearly physical is potentially like having a memory leak. You won't know something is wrong until it's potentially too late and when you do find out, it will be a major dilemma. All too often, even when healthcare costs are covered, people just don't bother going. If you're a startup founder, don't neglect your health, and make sure you take care of your body as well as you would your car.",1248880569

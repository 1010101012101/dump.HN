As pointed out by the appeal record (<a href=""http://www.seattleschools.org/area/board/10-11agendas/111710agenda/appealrecord.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seattleschools.org/area/board/10-11agendas/111710...</a>) there were three required non-fiction books for the 10th grade list: BNW, Othello, and Lord of the Flies.  Apparently all three make reference to native or indigenous people as ""savages"".<p>And then apparently in one lecture they promoted an inaccurate view as to why we have reservations.<p>It's kind of like the Huck Finn example.  If you read that book and it says the n-word -- that's one thing.  But if the other two required books also say it, then it begins to get a little odd.  I think people would reasonably begin to ask, ""you couldn't find one book that didn't say nigger/savage in it?""<p>Although her attacks on the text itself were misplaced and uncalled for.",1290124762

Here's what he (Peter Rez) says in the paper this is based on:<p>><i>The major public health effect of concern at low doses of ionizing radiation is cancer. There is clear evidence of cancer induction at effective dose above about 200 mSv. Below an effective dose of about 100 mSv radiogenic cancer mortality risk estimates for all cancers is highly uncertain. 16 It is not possible to determine reliably whether a radiogenic risk is present in an X-ray screening population because of the high spontaneous incidence of cancer and multifactorial nature of disease causation 17.</i><p>><i>Use of collective dose to estimate public health impacts when large populations are exposed to trivial doses is inappropriate and not reasonable. The assumptions implicit in the collective dose calculation conceal large biological and statistical uncertainties.16 If an individual passenger is not harmed by X-ray screening then the population isn’t either.</i><p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~atppr/RPD-Final-Form.pdf&pli=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.public.asu.edu...</a> (page 15)<p>linked from<p><a href=""http://www.public.asu.edu/~atppr/bodyscan.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.public.asu.edu/~atppr/bodyscan.html</a>",1290124518

I remember getting Terry Pratchett novels in my reading list.<p>A defacto ban is ""We're removing it from our reading list, removing it from our library... but we not discouraging our students from reading the book"". Removing it from a reading list isn't a defacto ban, it's modernization. If the kids at a specific school don't seem to respond well to a text, <i>PULL IT</i>. I don't care what text, even if it's one of my own beloveds just <i>PULL IT</i> and put in something the children will read and will learn from.<p>Brave New World is a classic, beyond perhaps, but if kids today aren't learning from it then so long. For every new book that goes on the list, an old one is going to come off of it. I'd much rather see kids get something like Monstrous Regiment by Terry Pratchett that they'll respond to.

The delicious part is that there is no one responding to anyone of my commentary in asking, is there something magical about iOS that makes the apps just more amazing. (The Android app has been out for 3 years and probably at least a year and a half before their seamless messaging was even being considered. It's no excuse for why the iOS FB app got messaging and Android didn't. I called out XMPP... you know... because that's the protocol that FB Chat uses. Additionally, the entire point of the seamless messaging is that it doesn't matter which protocol the communication goes over, it's all aggregated to the same place.)<p>Does the Facebook's app presence on an iOS device magically give it photo album support and chat support? No, that's silly.<p>So, all of you that continue to downvote me and aren't bothering to respond to my actual contention, I'll ask again. Why are we making fun of Android as a platform rather than indicting the developers that don't bake in the same features.<p>I've seen the code for a simple XMPP client in Android, and I know that it would not be hard to implement in the Facebook app. Yet it isn't.

I didn't make up the notion of the patriarchal society.</i><p>I didn't claim you made it up; but your presentation doesn't strike me as very accurate. In particular, ""It's obvious that marriage is a byproduct of this patriarchal structure"" seems wrongheaded. Marriage is a social institution; that means that the structure of marriage reflects the existing power structures in society.<p>Even in the most egalitarian societies, like Sweden, people still get married in great numbers. What's more, many of those who don't get married in fact do get married in all but name: they live together like a married couple indefinitely. Since there are often few benefits to explicit marriage, their choice represents little more than a willingness to forgo a religious ceremony. But it shouldn't surprise us that people in very secular countries decide to avoid big religious ceremonies; that's just common sense.<p><i>When a man and a woman fall in love, the first thing they try to do in a traditional/conservative society is to try and get married. In the west, the first thing they do is go out together, make out, have sex, maybe move in and live together for years and have children without ever officially getting married.</i><p>As I understand it, a great number of unmarried couples in traditional societies make out and have sex; the big difference is that they sneak around when doing so. But if you like, we can pretend that everyone in traditional societies actually strictly observes all their social norms.<p>Moreover, a great many people in western countries get married and stay married for many years. It seems silly to pretend that they don't exist. Your claims would be more persuasive if they were backed up by numbers.",1290123152

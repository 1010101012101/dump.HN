The same repeated later and I added 3rd set. Now I can push all 3 sets at the same intensity (actually, 2nd and 3rd are easier), and I tried adding 4th one but got an injury so I decided to stick with 3 as my optimum.",1414231112

8507714,comment,8506174,8507265,0,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> In particular, the technology for a completely unmanned, turret with an autoloader replacing the human loader and camera systems replacing &quot;stick your head out and have a look&quot;, has been around for decades; there are reasons it&#x27;s had only limited use.<p>It seems to be headed for wide use now -- all new major afv designs are now as small boxes as possible with remote-controlled turrets on top. Look up the Russian Armata and the German ifv Puma.<p>> Anyone know what the &quot;Active Protection System Launchers&quot; are actually launching?<p>Anti-missile/bomb defense.<p>> Unless they&#x27;ve left off most of the armor for the display model (which is possible), this can&#x27;t possibly be a main battle tank; there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s got enough armor to take a shot from a full-size tank gun.<p>Armor has greatly improved since the 80&#x27;s. Especially ceramics have improved by leaps and bounds. This, combined with the much reduced and streamlined internal protected volume, and greater allowed armor volume make a high level of protection possible with much lower weight than current designs. Even still, they only promise STANAG 4569 5+ for the 30t main design, and require 5t of additional applique to be fully resistant to guns from front.<p>In the eternal technological contest between armor and weaponry, we are currently at a <i>very</i> high point for armor. The combined development of radar-guided active defenses that defeat all slow projectiles and semi-reactive ceramics that shred and destabilize ke projectiles as they travel through them, given a 60t weight budget no reasonable design using current-level armor and weaponry could penetrate itself from any angle. Of course, given enough time this will just result in better guns, but as direct upscalings of modern tank guns have proven to be unworkable and abandoned by everyone, they will have to use some exotic new tech.<p>In the meantime, if fighting against 80&#x27;s tank guns, yes you can get full protection on frontal arcs at 35t or less.",1414230657
8507713,comment,8506041,8506918,0,0,7952,,,"It is fascinating how difficult it is to find a good argument for opposing nuclear power.  The discussion usually turns into an endless round of meaningless comparison that pretends that we only need one perfect choice instead several imperfect ones.<p>The best argument I have been able to come up with is that whilst it could be the perfect energy source humans are fundamentally incapable of designing or operating nuclear plants perfectly.  You end up with designs that are tightly coupled and massively complicated, which is always risky from an engineering perspective.  To make them safe you have to spend huge amounts of money on staff to maintain and operate.<p>Fukushima was designed and run by highly trained people but it still went wrong.  Several stations in the UK were designed by brilliant scientists and still needed flood defenses built in response to Fukushima.  There is a real threat and it is entirely due to the normal fallibility of humans.  I personally think that nuclear is a necessary choice, but it is hardly a good choice.  We need a new generation of generators that are very small, needs minimal maintenance, and have negligible risk even if they are completely destroyed.",1414230625

I&#x27;m totally ignorant of Parsoid but I respectfully suggest that bidirectional lossless conversion is not possible in general.<p>First, it relies on the function Wikitext->HTML being injective. But isn&#x27;t it trivial to create two different Wikitexts that compile to the same HTML? Whitespace is just the start of this story.<p>Second, apparently the template language is Turing-complete. Let&#x27;s say I write a prime sieve in order to generate a page that lists the first 100 prime numbers. What would it then mean to edit &quot;31&quot; to change it to &quot;30&quot;?<p>(With apologies for not yet having read the things you kindly linked to.)",1414228062

All are archived by default. Why do you think that is? Because they want to mine them for as long a possible. Unfortunately, for Americans, it also means that after 180 days the US government can get access to them without a warrant (according to the outdated ECPA).",1414227729

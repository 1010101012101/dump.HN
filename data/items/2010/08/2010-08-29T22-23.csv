Yet no one complains about that (unless it's poor optimization). You were so kind to suggest that my work is shoddy, I would say that shoddy work are websites that use hacks, or use non-semantical markup to archieve the goal of being able to work everywhere.

People switch cars more often than browser versions, I fail to understand why we allow that to happen. We have good solutions to handle legacy app compatibility like chrome frame. Everyone has right to it's own opinion, but is it wrong to want users to use proper browser? Even my phone is capable of rendering charts. How can supporting everyone at all cost be better than pushing for standards? We are forced to standards everywhere in real life, why not in IT?<p>This is a nice quote about what happens if you support broken by design browsers forever:<p>""Facebook explains its decision by saying that many users have complained about unstable chat sessions, or ones that stop completely. In order to improve the way connections are established and messages are sent, however, the social networking giant must make changes that aren't supported by older browsers.""<p>I'm not saying that everything FB does is right, but I think that legacy support sacrificing  experience of everyone else is not a solution to the problem, and this is a good example.",1283122007

Yeah well, how did this stereotype got built in the first place? and why isn't it the case with marketing? why this same expectation is not happening in sales? why tech?? The answer is clear: Women did it to themselfs. Men are not to blame. Women are not hackers by nature. It's usually a man who gets dirty. In my classroom, despite having the same teacher and the same lessons, it's always the boys who are trying to explain how things work to the ""lot"" of ladies who didn't get it.
I personally can't imagine a lady creating C, Python, or running facebook on her dormroom. Ladies usually have guys over there, not data servers. I just can't imagine a bunch of ladies locked in a garage working on something. Whenever I think of a group of women, The only thing that comes to my mind is that they are talking about how cool is desperate housewives, or how great was Sara's date. This is not my fault, they are responsible for what we the men think of them. And don't tell me there's a white male controlling their brains to do such things. They just do them. face it. SO WOMEN, STOP BLAMING THE MEN and BE PROUD OF WHAT YOU LOVE. be it cooking or dating magazines or what ever. why do you want to hate what you love and force yourself in men things? are you ashamed of what you do? Why do you consider what you do as the work of a second class citizen? Women tend to love different things and I don't understand why people are trying to force them into tech. PEOPLE, women DID NOT ask for your help. Too sad for the ladies who have this computer addictivness syndrome, your group did not follow you, you are just an exception.",1283122004

The fact that there are so few women in tech is an issue that is likely caused by multiple factors, some of which were addressed in this article, and some of which were addressed in the Arrington post. No one is wrong; each just seems to be arguing over which the greater factor is, but refuses to recognize the other.<p>Arrington cites factors dealing with biological and societal tendencies of women as reasons for them to not engage in risky lifestyle choices such as startups, or to not be interested in tech in the first place. I agree with this. This isn't 'bad' or 'good', but it's the truth. People need to stop ignoring that there ARE (on average) differences between men and women. We (women) just aren't as interested in tech or building our own businesses in general.<p>I'm just one data point, but based on many experiences, I would strongly argue that in general, women do not have the desire to take as many risks as males, or deal with day-to-day uncertainties. A vast majority of my female friends thought I was absolutely nuts when I first started doing startups. (They still think I'm a little nutty, despite being able to pay my bills now). The most common questions were, ""What are you going to do for money if it fails?"" (Answer: Get a job, or build something else), and ""How do you deal with not knowing what you're going to be doing in the next [insert some time period]?"" On the other hand, my male friends overwhelmingly asked about the technologies I'm building and admired me for taking a risk. Also interesting to note is that the reaction of female friends to my (male) co-founder was more of admiration than thinking he was crazy (but I was looked upon as crazy).<p>On the other hand, for the women who ARE interested in tech (or could be persuaded to be interested), there are certainly existing challenges within the field itself. Again, I'm just one data point, but I am always amazed at the reactions I get from males in the startup world when they find out that I code. They are SHOCKED. Not only because I'm a woman, but also because I'm a white, blonde woman who is reasonably attractive. Sometimes I really do feel like I'm not taken seriously by many people until I do something completely bad ass to prove myself. The other article certainly has a point there.",1283119383

If Dave was 25, I'd almost guarantee you wouldn't use that word.<p>In fact just by using that single word you've strengthened his argument.",1283119323

I love TechStars and YCombinator because they produce quality startups that I can potentially invest in, partner with or have on This Week in Startups.<p>There is nothing competitie between YC and JMC I can think of.",1283119248

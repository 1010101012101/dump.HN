You have exactly ZERO chance to win.<p>Even if cryonics will be a thing in the future, nobody is going to unfreeze you or put you in some body. I&#x27;m not even counting technological aspects, where your brain would be incorrectly frozen/lack of some key chemicals that has to be used that don&#x27;t exist yet/tissue not preserved well enough. Even if they COULD make you live, future people wouldn&#x27;t do it. Reason is that your brain has no value of any kind besides cryonics experimentation - means same value as a cow or a pig. Maybe even less, because your brain might bring trouble to ethicists who would be upset.<p>Cryonics for smart people is money spending equivalent of fortune teller for less smart people. Even if you explain to them it is not worth it, it doesn&#x27;t work like they think it works, etc., they will still be convinced they are right.

Github doesn&#x27;t change many of the fundamentals of how software improves in quality or how development works.<p>What I&#x27;ve observed in the industry has been a shocking lack of self-awareness about application of best practices, and decidedly half-assed attempts to improve. The state of the industry is not dev shops on the bleeding edge of the best tools, best methodologies, best policies, etc. It&#x27;s almost universally a tale of failing to even get to &quot;ok&quot; in terms of well-known best (or even better) practices. There are a ton of dev shops that don&#x27;t do any code reviews at all, and formal code reviews (which have been shown to be one of the best methods for improving code quality) are almost unheard of. Even at places that take testing seriously or do TDD they still typically don&#x27;t do it very well.<p>That&#x27;s why folks like Uncle Bob and Martin Fowler continue to have so much traction in the industry, because simply following good advice that was old 20 years ago is <i>still</i> a huge step forward for the average, or even above average, dev shop in the industry today.<p>Saying &quot;we&#x27;ve learned a lot&quot; just tells me that I shouldn&#x27;t take you seriously, because clearly we haven&#x27;t.

I&#x27;m claiming that at a glance it looks like professional code of a quality similar that of other high quality C codebases: Linux, Python, Perl, Apache, sqlite, etc.  One can always do better.<p>I (and likely the author) disagree with you on the importance of checking the return value of malloc().  Because of overcommit (as you point out), a non-null value returned from malloc() does not mean that you will not crash when you access the pointer. If the pointer is used directly, crash on NULL might a reasonable approach.  It&#x27;s when NULL is retained and then used as the base of an array that it may become a security problem.  Configuring malloc() to abort() on failure would be probably my preferred solution.<p>I agree with the last point, but think it&#x27;s a minor one.

At the &quot;end&quot; of a successful project, I usually pitch a retainer agreement to the client. There are lots of variations on the terms, but I&#x27;ve generally done something like &quot;for (~12-24) months, you buy (~8-24) of my hours guaranteed per month at a discount rate of (~10-15%) off my standard rate. Invoiced at the beginning of each month, use it or lose it (throw in a month of rollover if they push back).&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a win-win: the average client doesn&#x27;t use anywhere near their entire allotment, but in general they&#x27;re happy to pay for the &quot;insurance&quot; that you&#x27;ll be available if you need them. You&#x27;re never on the hook for more than you can reasonably provide: if something bad happens and they need more than their allotment, then you can renegotiate that as a new contract.

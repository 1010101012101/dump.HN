460191,comment,459874,459874,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"The scientifically un-rigorous interpretation on my part is that women instinctively lie about sex much more than men.  This is quite understandable as a woman's survival in the ancestral environment was most often about how effectively she capitalized on her sex appeal.  This would involve pretending to be more aroused in situations where she was expected to be aroused (i.e. an alpha male <i>wants</i> her to be aroused) and not showing signs of arousal in situations where she shouldn't (don't let the alpha male see you lusting after a different male).<p>Now the fact that women responded to a broader range of pictures than men I have no ideas about.  Perhaps it is not an adaptation but merely a side effect of women being more empathetic.  Do women have more/more highly reactive mirror neurons?  Have any studies been done on this?",1233442198

This situation was possible due to constant money issuing to the economy via finance sector. That process started in the late 70 and often called as Reaganomics. More details are in paper.<p>In general if issuing of money stops, the 25-35% of USA economy will disappear. Most of that 25-35% are Hi-Tech companies. 
So, economics of startups are in danger. VCs firms don't have hot money anymore for funding. No more easy exits such as IPO and aquisition. Customer spending are going down.<p>And it will become true very soon :-(",1233439833

People have done great stuff with JavaScript and it's not for money. For me, though I neglected the language for some years as I always thought it's a toy language (lesson leanred: always try rather than listening to complaints) but despite its shortcomings the language has a strange appeal. Also, I know for a fact that good JavaScript developers are not in abundance.
The way author has tried to compare Java & ActionScript--which is totally beyond my comprehension. I think I'm moderately competent but I can show author quite a few things that can be expressed quite elegantly in JavaScript than say Java.

204792,comment,204602,204756,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Congratulations. You are not the target of that kind of fear-mongering. IMHO, the majority of the people intelligent enough to be on HN aren't either. Books like 1984 and 'State of Fear' are intended for consumption by The Proles (to use the term from 1984 itself). They're intended to raise awareness for what's going on to those that willing trade liberty for a (false) sense of security. I think our bearing the presence of these books is well worth others waking up and smelling the coffee for the first time.",1212176738
204791,comment,204417,204417,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yahoo is beginning to treat the whole Internet like an operating system...in the sense that there are Windows UI guidelines, Mac OS UI guidelines, Gnome UI guidelines, etc.  If everybody were to standardize on the important stuff, usability of the web in general would go way up.  Much the same way going from DOS to Windows (or Mac OS) made it possible for a very large number of applications to share common conventions, making them all easier to use.<p>I don't know how strong the business case for this is for Yahoo's bottom line, but it does seem like it's cheaper to define the standards rather than play catch-up on converting two or three years down the road when everyone settles on a set of conventions.  It's also good to be a thought leader among developers and designers...frankly, I feel more warm-fuzzies for Yahoo these days than Google, primarily because Yahoo has done so much for improving web design and making UI development on the web really nice and predictable.  They've begun to turn it from a black art into an engineering discipline (vision and taste still matter, but a lot of the usability problems have been formalized into a coherent system rather than a pile of guesses).",1212176658

204787,comment,204307,204307,0,0,natch,,,"Each idea becomes a project, even if it is a potential project.<p>Projects are under a year (2008) directory under a 'work' directory (where work refers to something I'm working on, as in in-progress, not work as in job). But job stuff can go under work/{year}/projname too.<p>So then I have:<p>~/work/2006/proj1
~/work/2006/proj2
~/work/2006/projn
~/work/2007/proj1
~/work/2007/projn
~/work/2008/proj1
~/work/2008/projn<p>etc.<p>Then when something is really finished and polished, I move it to a ~/proj/projname directory. That happens only rarely. I've been reconsidering this and might start keeping everything in its original place under ~/work/{year}/projname<p>The other systems I've tried suffer from not being scalable as the years go by.<p>Periodically I back up each year (zipped and gpged) to Amazon S3 with a script.<p>Sometimes a project will span years, of course. When that happens I decide on a case-by-case basis whether to do a symbolic link back to one original project directory, or whether to start fresh at some point with a clean set of files for that project, leaving the cruft behind but still intact in a previous year.<p>Inside each project I can still use version control for the project.<p>Some projects are just repositories for ideas. Projects can be my own, or they can be me playing with third party tools I've downloaded. Even just a new open source package I'm installing might get its own project, with all files, if it's tricky and I want to make my own installation notes for future reference.<p>All project directories have a notes.txt file (or can have, at least). I have a 'tagthis' script that takes text tags as argument and adds the new tags to header lines in notes.txt in the current directory. Then later I can grep for these tags.<p>Works pretty well so far. It gives me the freedom to call anything, even an idea I don't have time to work on right now, a project and make a starting place for it. So-called projects in this scheme are very, very informal, so it's a very light weight system that doesn't get in my way, yet it keeps everything organized forever.",1212176441

We serve hundreds of thousands of video streams a day, and have supported up to 60,000+ live concurrent viewers. Our site is growing every week, and we just added another two 10 gbps lines to our colo. Our unique visitors are up 900% since January.<p>There are a lot of pieces that fit together to make Justin.tv work: our video cluster, IRC server, our web app, and our monitoring and search services, to name a few. We're looking for a talented engineer with a strong linux background to help scale all of these services; planning future hardware infrastructure, building monitoring to keep our Quality of Service up, and helping design and optimize our application architecture.<p>Responsibilities<p><pre><code>    * Plan our future hardware expansion and network topologies for the web, video and chat clusters
    * Build monitoring and alerting systems to maintain uptime as we grow
    * Install hardware, buy bandwidth, and automate bringing up new systems
    * Work with application engineers to identify and fix bottlenecks in the app code
</code></pre>
Qualifications<p><pre><code>    * Extremely strong linux background (we use ubuntu and debian, what do you like?)
    * Experience scaling web applications
    * Programming background (this job will require building many things, and digging into the application code)
    * Experience hacking video streams, python, Twisted or rails all a plus.
</code></pre>
While we're growing rapidly, Justin.tv is still a small, technology focused company, built by hackers for hackers. Seven of our ten person team are engineers or designers. We believe in rapid development, and push out new code releases every week. We're based in a beautiful office in the SOMA district of SF, one block from the caltrain station. If you want a fun job hacking on code that will touch a lot of people, JTV is for you.<p>Note: You must be physically present in SF to work for JTV. Completing the technical problem at <a href=""http://www.justin.tv/problems/spellcheck"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justin.tv/problems/spellcheck</a> will go a long way with us.

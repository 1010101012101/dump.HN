The bombing of Nagasaki occurred in the late morning of August 9, after the Supreme Council had already begun meeting to discuss surrender, and word of the bombing only reached Japan's leaders in the early afternoon -- after the meeting of the Supreme Council had been adjourned in deadlock and the full cabinet had been called to take up the discussion. Based on timing alone, Nagasaki can't have been what motivated them.</i><p>I've not read the whole thing (just starting work, have it marked for later) so I may be jumping the gun with this comment, but that paragraph jumped out. A lot of arguments I see for why dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary seem fairly rooted in hindsight - this doesn't make the arguments wrong, but it does mean we can't judge the decisions made on these metrics because at the time people did not have that hindsight to help them.<p>Did they <i>know</i> that the effect of soviet actions would be so detrimental to Japan long-term?<p>Did they absolutely <i>know</i> that Japan, or one of its allies, didn't have something up its sleeve had the potential to turn that situation around? Or that a sudden change of fortunes wouldn't disable a large chunk of the relevant forces against Japan such that they could pull themselves ""back into the game""?<p>No one thing beat Japan. War isn't about doing the <i>one</i> thing that will probably stop an enemy: it is about trying to make sure they stop and stay stopped long enough for you to solidify your position and deal with your other problems (particularly, in a large war, battles on other fronts). This often means hitting an enemy while they are down just in case. Rule 4: The double-tap.<p>Of course as taps go dropping a nuke over a civilian target is at best morally dubious, this is undeniable IMO, but I find a lot of the arguments against to be ill considered from the point of view of what people making the decisions at the time <i>definitely</i> knew, definitely knew that they knew, and the long list of things that they could not confirm so strongly.",1370332021

But it also served U.S. interests. If the Bomb won the war, then the perception of U.S. military power would be enhanced, U.S. diplomatic influence in Asia and around the world would increase, and U.S. security would be strengthened. The $2 billion spent to build it would not have been wasted. If, on the other hand, the Soviet entry into the war was what caused Japan to surrender, then the Soviets could claim that they were able to do in four days what the United States was unable to do in four years, and the perception of Soviet military power and Soviet diplomatic influence would be enhanced. And once the Cold War was underway, asserting that the Soviet entry had been the decisive factor would have been tantamount to giving aid and comfort to the enemy.<p>It basically argues, yeah, both Stalin AND the bomb likely contributed to a surrender. This part is not cited as well, however.

5818077,comment,5817577,5817577,3,0,bane,,,"One of the difficulties of fixing the problem is going to be that you can't just pass a law that says <i>poof</i> ""you must be the company that makes a thing in order to have a patent on a thing"". There are many legitimate reasons for patents to be tradeable assets. Take for example the basement tinkerer who comes up with and patents a completely novel widget. They may not have the resources to build, market and sell that widget. But a Samsung might want to buy that patent for a couple million and make those widgets themselves.<p>Sure the basement tinkerer could license the patent to Samsung, even an <i>exclusive</i> perpetual license, which is almost as good as owning it, and might be the preferred path forward (though there can be some problems with that too as companies start to defensively buy exclusive perpetual licenses with no intention of making those widgets just to keep others out of that market).<p>But at this point, any law requiring such licenses would have to be for those going forward. Any retroactive law would require either handing back legally purchased patents (which destroys wealth) or require the originator to buy them back (which may be impossible in many cases if they've already spent the money on retirement homes).<p>The core reason patents become so valuable is because they last so damn long. If they didn't last until the next ice age it would take much of the value out of ownership and make licensing naturally make more sense anyway. The way to attack this is at the root and revert back the patent expiration to something far more reasonable.",1370329619

Helping broker is would be profit prohibitive to brokers, hence the slow tech adoption rate.  Now if look from consumer&#x27;s view, a big problem is to identify what a fair price a house should be in a given area at a certain period of time.  The shopping experience only benefit broker which helps to turn on buyer&#x27;s buying mode.  To consumer such a big purchase there are far more important questions to answer before a real estate agent has all the advantages to rip off.  Apart from the real estate wall guarded listing, is there any open geographic, demographic data available from which any meaningful software can be built independent from real estate industry?  A disruption of real estate industry can only come from outside, and it can lucrative for just considering the amount of fees a broker has taken away from each transaction today.  It is amazing so few of founders have targeted real estate industry.  It truly needs think outside the box, don&#x27;t be like zillow or trulia.",1390258746

I was in London and I was visiting a friend and former co-worker who, after the startup we&#x27;d been in together in Edinburgh collapsed, had moved on to become one of the syadmins at The Digital Village, Douglas&#x27;s game production house. (At the time they were working on Starship Titanic.) So I dropped round at TDV to say &quot;hi&quot; to my friend C. and a couple of other former acquaintances, and was taken aback when I was ushered into the boardroom, given a cup of tea, introduced to the MD, and then this tall, gawky fellow was wheeled in to shake my hand.<p>(I was so overawed I couldn&#x27;t string enough words together to embarrass myself. (So that&#x27;s okay then.) I only figured out afterwards that they were expanding and looking for new hires, and C. or another acquaintance (the UK internet scene was rather small in the mid-90s) had suggested seeing if I&#x27;d bite. As it would have involved moving to London and I&#x27;d just bought a flat in Edinburgh and high speed internet meant 56K modem dialup at Â£3 per hour, the answer was &quot;no, but thanks&quot; ...)<p>Anyway. Anecdote time:<p>Back around 1996-8, Apple went through a spot of bother with the Powerbook range -- during the Amelio years, the number of models proliferated and the build quality fell through the floor. In particular, Douglas had been toting around a Powerbook 1600cs or similar, and the blessed thing was exhibiting a tendency to halt and catch fire.<p>C. got a bit annoyed about this, because Douglas was about to depart on a speaking tour of the US, and C. was responsible for ensuring his laptop worked. And this machine had been sent back for repair about three times, and replaced twice. So he phoned TDV&#x27;s Apple technical support contact.<p>&quot;Hello? It&#x27;s about this Powerbook 1600CS, serial number blah, that we keep sending back. Our CEO needs it fixed, urgently, but every replacement you send us is dead.&quot;<p>&quot;Uh, well, there&#x27;s a bit of a problem with that model. Send it in and we&#x27;ll get a working one to you next week, I promise.&quot;<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t think you understand. <i>Our CEO</i> is about to go on a speaking tour tomorrow.&quot;<p>&quot;Yes, we&#x27;ll get you a replacement next week --&quot;<p>&quot;Our CEO is Douglas Adams, one of your company&#x27;s leading evangelists.

Even if the Chargepoint display says charging is complete, if you unplug a Volt it sets off the theft alarm.<p>Kind of fascinating to watch this evolve. Definitely need some better charging tech if electric cars are going to last.",1390258035

If you sell paper, a user knows what to do with these - package gifts, wrap books. Googel doesn&#x27;t unless you put &quot;paper to wrap books&quot; on your site, it doesn&#x27;t show in peoples search results. A list of mobile phones? Google doesn&#x27;t know that you try to sell these, your website visitor immediatly does. If you only have brand names and don&#x27;t use smartphone, if your button is called &quot;add to basket&quot;, it does not show your page for &quot;buy smartphone&quot; unless you stick it to your site, a lot of it, but just below the Panda threshold. This is the reason ecommerce sites explain what a &quot;jacket&quot; is on their search result page. No user needs this, but the web is plastered with &quot;hints&quot; for the Google algorithm by legitimate websites, not spammers.
Everytime I surf pages, I see this Google hints making websites ugly everywhere.<p>The other result of Google is so much different from humans in reality: The algo can&#x27;t determine between legitimate content (e.g. good guest posts) and spam.

Their sample has 3752 observations, of which black hosts account for 7% (~260 obs). Given that the group of interest is a relatively rare event or outlier, it would be better to not compare them to the entire population using standard OLS regression models.  Instead, a matching solution (e.g. propensity score matching) would be a better solution so a more representative group would be constructed that matches the black hosts.<p>Despite the regression attempting to control for this to some degree by including the other observable variables, the regression model is attempting to fit to all the observed prices.  Given that the majority of the listings aren&#x27;t black hosts not likely to be suitable matches to the black hosts, the fit isn&#x27;t most representative of that relationship.<p>2. They don&#x27;t include the adjusted R-squared value for their regressions; thus, we don&#x27;t know how much of the price variance is really being accounted for.<p>3. They conclude that by including other observables available to customers on Airbnb (like the location rating), that they have removed omitted variable bias. Let&#x27;s take the &#x27;location rating&#x27; as an example of how this is problematic.  When I book in Airbnb, I may initially sort by Airbnb&#x27;s metrics; however, once I find a short list of matching options, I drill down into them to try and determine how well they fit my needs.  This additional consumer analysis isn&#x27;t accounted for by the high level Airbnb metrics, yet I bet it is a primary driver in users booking with one listing over another.<p>Despite this, I still think it is a good paper to start this analysis.

The payment code is delivered by a response from the server-side & as such it is in scope for at least PCI section six.  As an example, if the JavaScript code or reference comes via an HTTP & not HTTPS request it can be tampered with on the wire & the code replaced with code from the attacker, thus getting in the middle of the transaction.  If there&#x27;s an SQLi or persistent type-2 XSS flaw on the server side an attacker could similarly modify the code there.  People need to stop believing that tokenization does anything more than remove the need to protect credit-cards in memory on the server side & pay attention to their security.  Since the concept of tokenization hit the scene I&#x27;m seeing worse security around card transactions than I ever have before in my reviews.  Worse, people convinced that tokenization entirely clears them from PCI responsibility tend to be argumentative & resistant to what I believe to be common sense guidance.

I personally have moved to it because it is where the future of the web (i believe) is going. Real time, web socket, internet of things (devices) all integrate with the node use case well. PHP is good for web dev, but node is transitioning to allow one to go far beyond web development. I believe that if you want to be a developer, your skill set and pay rate coming out of school will be much higher if you have significant node experience rather than significant PHP experience.",1390255581

7092040,comment,7090004,7091488,3,0,Kronopath,,,"I agree. It&#x27;s impressive to me the people who are claiming that something like unit testing can compare to these kinds of tools, without seeing the general direction these tools are headed in. Unit tests are helpful, no doubt. But compare the following:<p>- Spend several minutes writing a small test suite for the functionality you&#x27;re writing. Write that functionality until you think it&#x27;s correct. Compile, run. See a &quot;Pass!&quot; or &quot;Fail! (reasons: ...)&quot; in your console or IDE, fix it until it&#x27;s working. Feedback loop is measured in minutes, seconds at best.<p>Vs.:<p>- Write the functionality. As you&#x27;re writing, you see the data flow through your program in real-time, immediately identifying bugs. Any unit tests you may have are _even more useful_ because you can inspect your program at any level, without having to debug or step through your program. No need to re-compile and re-run, no need to even Alt-Tab. Feedback loop is measured in milliseconds.<p>Light table isn&#x27;t quite there yet, but it&#x27;s a strong step in the right direction. Unit tests help, but they don&#x27;t obviate the need for better tools.<p>To give a bit of context on the direction these tools are trying to move in, Light Table was heavily inspired by the work of Bret Victor, who bases his work on the idea that, quote, &quot;Creators need immediate feedback to what they&#x27;re creating.&quot; If you haven&#x27;t seen his _Inventing on Principle_ talk [0], you should. It&#x27;s one of the most eye-opening talks on software and design I&#x27;ve ever seen.<p>[0] <a href=""http://vimeo.com/36579366"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/36579366</a>",1390255508

My opinion is that nofollow has actually come full circle and now makes it easier for the spammers. Since almost all legitimate links are nofollow, the only way Â to get &quot;follow&quot; links is to pay people to explicitly put them up for you, have friends give them to you, or create spam websites to link to yourself. The people who happily find my website and are excited about it tend to post to social media, and occasionally some blog posts, but very, very rarely a follow link.",1390255417

7092031,comment,7091493,7091932,3,0,bradleyjg,,,"That&#x27;s a legitimate concern, but it has a narrower application than you&#x27;ve suggested. If a blog post doesn&#x27;t have links that point back to the author&#x27;s &quot;home&quot; website, then it&#x27;s not an issue either way. Also, either the author or the guest site can set nofollow.<p>So our hypothetical innocent user has to be sophisticated enough to 1) have a home site, 2) blog on a different site, and 3) include links, (and have some legitimate non-SEO reason to want to put links to his home page in the first place) while at the same time neither he nor his host be sophisticated enough to know about nofollow.<p>It&#x27;s certainly possible but I&#x27;m skeptical that it is a large catagory. Plus, I doubt that whatever countermeasure google comes up with is going to be a nuke from orbit response for a very occasional suspected spammy guest post. Instead I expect they will be going after the many many instances that look like a concerted effort.",1390255385

To be with God (which is what we would call &#x27;salvation&#x27;) we would also need to be without sin. Obviously, no human is without sin - meaning we could never be with God. Prior to Jesus, we were required to sacrifice things in order to atone for our sins and get right with God. Jesus provided an eternal, perfect sacrifice to pay for everyone&#x27;s sins. It isn&#x27;t so much that we need to worship Him, more that  we need to accept the sacrifice He has already provided - if we reject the sacrifice, the full penance for all our actions is on us, and we can never be with God.",1438562615

The proof of &quot;the powerset of the natural is uncountable&quot; (or equivalently, expanding out the definition of uncountability, &quot;there does not exist a bijection between N and P(N)&quot;) is constructive, and will hold just as well in intuinistic logic. You can&#x27;t get away from uncountable sets.<p>On the other hand, you could prove a metatheoretic result, constructing a model which only contains sets which are forced to exist by some finite formula (and therefore the model is countable). But that you can do in ordinary classical set theory also (the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem, Gödel&#x27;s constructible universe).<p>I guess this is analogous to how, in constructive logic every function is computable, but it is not possible to internalize this fact as an axiom in the logic.

I was surprised that someone could make it that accessible inside of 20 minutes.<p>I do agree that a &quot;there is mathematical dispute [++] over whether this operation is valid&quot; disclaimer could have accompanied the part where AoC was used.<p>[++] Side note: &quot;mathematical dispute&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean what many non-mathematicians think it does. AoC isn&#x27;t as &quot;controversial&quot; as some make it out to be. There is no disagreement over whether it&#x27;s &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; in any Platonic sense. Rather, there is nearly universal acknowledgement that a valid mathematical system exists with AoC and that a valid mathematical system exists without it... and that both have useful properties. Mathematical dispute over an axiom means that a valid mathematics exists with or without the axiom-- not necessarily that mathematicians hold strong and divergent opinions on whether to include it.<p>As for the physical interpretations, he&#x27;s right in that nothing that we know about physics rules out a Banach-Tarski-like behavior at the subatomic level. That said, it&#x27;s obviously impossible to Banach-Tarski an orange or a ball of gold, since we&#x27;d have to literally split every atom. A macroscopic Banach-Tarski event is almost certainly impossible and would be, even with some unforeseen physical capability that made it possible, extremely expensive in terms of energy due to mass-energy equivalence.",1438562201

Quite different from the Christian communities you&#x27;d see in the USA. Christians are a small minority in Thailand and there are more Muslim and Chinese than Christian. Each one has their own community. I visited a Muslim community because one of my wife&#x27;s cousins had married a Muslim man. They were very nice to me and my family. Five times a day a car would loud speakers would drive around for their daily prayer. There was no pork or alcohol for sale before their religion forbids it. They cut their chicken differently from us, but it tastes good.<p>I am not sure if they&#x27;d go for a secular community. They already got one of their own religious communities and have done this sort of thing for most of their lives.<p>Moving away from religion and becoming secular is a western thing not an eastern thing.<p>I see the Dawkins Foundation was mentioned, a lot of times they criticize and attack religions when they could have used the resources to help out people in the community instead. Using hate instead of love, and then sometimes having to retract web pages when proven wrong like the Jesus is Horus thing or the Easter is Ishtar thing.<p>You have secular communities in the USA and UK, but they are small and limited.<p>Public schools in the USA got rid of religion, but didn&#x27;t find anything to replace it to teach morals and ethics instead like critical thinking.<p>The problem is when you get rid of religion you get rid of a lot of good stuff too, and if you claim religion is bad and you get rid of it, it is like tossing the baby out with the bathwater. A lot of Christian charities did adoptions, and got attacked because they didn&#x27;t support same sex marriage, so they went out of business and left a big hole to be filled. The same with Christian homeless shelters, many had to close down due to being attacked and criticized. There were no secular homeless shelters to replace them.<p>As the community moves away from religion and towards secularism, they have to replace the structure that was there by religious communities.

Jon Armstrong from Cofactor Genomics here. You hit on some excellent points.<p>So you can detect circ. RNA that come from specific tissues and partition those reads out as expression for those tissues?<p>In reality, we are detecting circRNA that arises or predominates during a specific disease state and then partition those reads out as a signal for the disease state. On a related note, the circRNA molecule resists degradation much more than linear RNA molecules, leading to a longer half-life and less variability in signal from tissue, plasma, and exosomes.<p>What kind of coverage do you need to do that?<p>Currently, 100&#x27;s of million of reads need to be generated to just detect the highest expressed circRNAs. We have a patent pending circRNA enrichment technology (supported by a large NIH phase II grant) that increases the ratio of circRNA in the total RNA pool by logs, thus one could sequence logs less reads for the same level of detection. The coverage cutoff for detection can be &quot;tuned&quot; for assay sensitivity.<p>Are mRNA circularization rates consistent among different genes?<p>CircRNAs do not seem to be translated into proteins and probably perform multiple regulatory functions. Also, the level of a linear form does not correlate with the level of the circular form for the same gene. As with linear mRNA production, which is not consistent from gene to gene or tissue to tissue, we observe the same phenomenon with circRNA.<p>Hope this info helps.",1438561832

For them it was mostly a social gathering, an opportunity to sing enthusiastically together (and how often do you get to do that today?), and a lot of social events (church picnics etc). As a social group it worked very well. People really would help each other out. The subject of religion rarely came up in any of these social events, and you could certainly get by without having any real belief or even much knowledge of traditional Christianity.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to think why it worked while secular communities do not, since it was in a sense a secular community. All I can think of is that most members had been there all their lives, it was what they grew into, and it was welcoming to outsiders.<p>If you can handle the cognitive dissonance of listening to sermons every week that you do not really believe, I think it can be a plausible way of getting that kind of social engagement.",1438560650

So, say you have a class with a const member, and you have to pass it in to a function? Well, that&#x27;s a bit unusual - const members are pretty rare in my experience. But the underlying problem sounds like: you have a const object, and you want to pass it into a function. There are three possibilities, I suppose:<p>1. The function takes const T & or const T * , because it doesn&#x27;t change that argument. So no problem.<p>2. The function takes T, because it doesn&#x27;t change that argument (and the object is small and/or the programmer doesn&#x27;t care about the copying - irrelevant issues here). So no problem.<p>3. The function takes T & or T * , because it changes that argument. Compilation fails! But - no problem! Because this is what you want. You passed what&#x27;s supposedly a const object into a function that expected to be able to change it. Obviously compilation has to fail.<p>So maybe the problem is people declaring parameters as T & or T * , when they meant const T & or const T * ?<p>I bet if C++ had const by default, this problem would never arise.

Some top-notch colleges don't ask for test scores at all""<p>What is the evidence that colleges are abandoning the SAT test? What top-notch colleges do you specifically have in mind that don't ask for test scores at all?<p>Some comments on trends in college preferences for test scores can be found in<p><a href=""http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/harvard-university/579659-report-harvard-info-session-sunday-28-september-2008-a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/harvard-university/57965...</a><p>of which the immediately relevant part is a statement by a Harvard admission officer at a public meeting, ""There are a lot of students with A's, and test scores help us distinguish among them. Standardized tests are comparison tools. The better predictors are SAT II Subject Tests and AP tests. They are more important than the SAT I or the ACT. You may have read that colleges are expressing doubt about standardized tests, but I'll give you a clue: We won't be cutting back on tests. We might require five SAT II tests. Those are less coachable than the SAT I.""<p>The largest number of colleges that are publicized as SAT-optional might in fact better be characterized as admission-requirement-optional, as they admit most applicants who apply at all, and in many cases have explicit open-admission policies.<p>""a very bright girl who also took a dozen SAT practice tests, got a 1600 on the main section. I had no practice tests and got a 1510. In the end, the numbers are so close as not to matter.""<p>This is a good point. Students who obsess about a perfect SAT score simply don't understand the theory of estimating mental abilities. Any one instance of taking the test is a sample of learned behavior, and no such sample is exhaustive.<p>Because almost all students make mistakes on the SAT, and because all colleges desire to fill their entering classes each year, all colleges everywhere gladly admit students who made mistakes on the SAT.<p><a href=""http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-admissions/413821-sat-score-frequencies-freshman-class-sizes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-admissions/41382...</a><p>And yet, a perfect SAT score does not guarantee admission at any college.<p><a href=""http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/parents-forum/377882-how-do-top-scorers-tests-fail-gain-admission-top-schools.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/parents-forum/377882-how...</a><p>So really students worry far too much about the SAT when they could be doing something important like reading a challenging book about a subject they like or pursuing a personal project that satisfies their curiosity.",1230820925

Once your I-485 has been approved for a period of 6 months or longer, you can move companies, though from what I hear, it raises a few questions when it comes for the INS to finally approve your petition.",1230820846

My dad's old set of the first printing of the Great Books came into my house recently after he died.<p>""From the start, The Great Books of the Western World project was a paradoxical undertaking. Hutchins and his evangelising colleague Mortimer Adler were elitists on a democratic mission, popularisers who made few concessions to popular taste. The texts came unadorned with any historical or biographical materials to situate the reader, but such orientation was besides the point: Hutchins wanted the reader to confront the texts of Aristotle, Dante and Aeschylus naked, as it were, without any guidance or forethought.""<p>My biggest problem with the Great Books of the Western World has always been that they are the books of the WESTERN world only. I am a westerner myself, and I can't think of a lot of titles in that series that are wholly unimportant, but there is a lot of Chinese literature available in good English translations with at least as much worldwide influence and historical importance.",1230820309

Please, <i>please</i> everyone promise me to never base your investment decisions on this discredited form of mean-variance optimization.<p>This method of stock selecting was invented by Harry Markowitz in 1952. In the intervening sixty (!) years we have accumulated overwhelming evidence that plain vanilla mean variance optimization doesn't work. Among its many flaws:<p>1. It makes unrealistic assumptions about the distribution of returns (i.e. that they are multivariate normal, when it is well known that returns exhibit heavy tails, time-varying volatility, fluctuating correlations etc etc).<p>2. It relies on you having good estimates of the expected annual return of individual stocks. How do you propose to get these? Don't say you'll use historical measurements, unless you really believe that last year's return is a good predictor of this year's return (it's not, except perhaps in some sectors, and even then it's difficult to measure and you'd be subject to crash risk).<p>3. The optimization procedure is error-maximizing. That is, even if returns <i>were</i> multivariate normal <i>and</i> you had a reliable way to measure the expected return on stocks, you'd still have errors in your covariance matrix, and these errors are amplified by the optimization procedure. You can see this in the article, then the ""optimum"" portfolio recommends putting 75% of your portfolio in MSFT and shorting AMZN and AAPL. Does anyone really believe that's sensible? Does anyone believe that such a portfolio is diversified?<p>The problem is that your model of stock returns is subject to massive overfitting. Let's say you have data for the last 10 years (i.e. about 2500 days). If there are N stocks in your portfolio, you need N(N+1)/2 pieces of information to specify the covariance matrix, which puts an upper limit of 70 stocks in your universe (since 70 * 71 / 2 ~ 2500). A good rule of thumb is that you should have 10 observations per free parameter, which cuts that number down to 22 stocks (22 * 23 / 2 ~ 500). I think that most portfolios consisting of 22 single-name stocks aren't sufficiently diversified (and you'll still be subject to the first two problems above).<p>In 2012, <i>no one</i> should be using mean-variance optimization to select stocks. At the very least, shrink the covariance matrix toward some sensible prior (e.g. constant correlations, sector correlations, or a factor model) and backtest your strategy over the past 10-20 years and look at the annual volatility, size and length of drawdowns, skewness and information ratio.",1344473810

Or quieter?\n</code></pre>\nSound intensity for a plane wave is given by the equation $I = \xi^2 \omega^2 c \rho$. Here $\xi$ is the particle displacement (the amplitude of our wave), $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $c \rho$, typically called $Z$, is the characteristic acoustic impedance, where $c$ is the speed of sound and $\rho$ is the density of the medium.<p>Given that the speed of sound is roughly independent of pressure, and keeping all other variables equal, as $\rho$ decreases, $I$ also decreases. So yes, on Mars, sounds are much quieter.<p>Sources:\n<a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/672/what-is-the-relation-of-sound-propagation-to-air-pressure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/672/what-is-the-r...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_intensity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_intensity</a>",1344473674

I'm more worried about the subtle moral, social and political implications that the loss of <i>impersonal information</i> might bring about. Will Google rank negative information about my favorite Congressional candidate lower in its search results, because I often email my friends with positive information about him? How long before a Wikipedia article about some scientific fact gets ranked below misinformation that an annoying relative has emailed me about 20 times last year? I'm a firm believer in the idea that the best way to make most people open-minded is to force them to confront diversity in their daily lives. But the more you are surrounded with personalized stuff that appeal to your appetites, the less likely you are to confront the Other. Of course I don't want Google forcing anyone to read anything, but I don't want them to discourage people from reading certain things, either. I want my information sorted by <i>relevance</i>, not anyone's political biases. Accidental discovery was not an unintended side effect of the design of the web. It is a natural consequence of the fact that facts are impersonal.<p>I'm also not sure whether something like Google Now could fill the role of completely unpersonalized, ""objective"" information.

There was a blog post on here a few weeks back on pricing strategy that made the front page. I believe it was for a web app, and the company discovered through segmentation and other techniques that they were leaving a lot of money on the table. They changed their pricing structure and this led to a significant increase in revenues. I believe the company worked with a consultant.",1344470567
4358775,comment,4355706,4357377,3,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"> Then why didn't they spread and colonize the next day, as you have claimed they would?<p>They do. Armpits are smelly because the sweat glands there excrete bacterial nutrients designed to feed smelly bacteria. Aluminum compounds plug the outlet of the sweat glands, choking off the supply of nutrients. The plugs last for days.<p>> Once you've eliminated an area, it's going to be a while, regardless of the small amounts of bacteria on other areas.<p>The other areas have 1 million bacteria per square centimeter that are easily spread, and a population doubling time of around 20 minutes in a favorable area like a damp armpit. Run the numbers on geometric growth at that rate. Even if you reduce bacterial density by 99.99%, they will be back in a few hours.",1344470517

To start off - we are almost entirely a software company. Amazon Fresh, on the other hand, has  warehouses, trucks and they own the inventory - completely different from us. We believe those differences are significant - and hopefully they speak volumes too :)",1344470510

You certainly draw grand conclusions from head-bobbing at a talk you made.<p>It's the licence used for I dare say the largest collaborative open source project in the world, Linux. GPL is the most widely used open source licence, used in tons of collaborative projects, from the top of my head: gcc, git, mercurial, qemu, ffmpeg, x264, blender, gimp, inkscape, mplayer, emacs, etc are all examples of other collaboratively developed GPL licenced projects.<p>And how exactly would it be 'anti-collaborative'? If anything it's a great licence for 'collaborative development' as all participants are legally bound by the licence to release their changes in source form when they distribute.",1344470502

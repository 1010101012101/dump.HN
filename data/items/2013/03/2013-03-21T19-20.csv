What happened to Adria could happen to any of us outspoken women. She didn't handle the situation perfectly, but there's no way she could have known this would unfold in this way. She said she didn't want the guy to get fired and apologized to him. I'm horrified by what happened to her and now afraid the same could happen to me.<p>None of us should have to be afraid that a tweet like that could get someone fired, provoke threats, or warrant attacks on our companies.<p>The nature of the attacks against Adria are EXTREMELY misogynistic (rape threats, death threats, people calling her a c_nt, b_tch, wh_re, etc) and many people have taken up a ""burn her at the stake"" mentality. They've also pulled into question her professional credibility and called her an affirmative action hire. They are saying this kind of behavior should be expected from someone with the domain ""butyouragirl"".<p>There is a simply an undue level of hatred for Adria which is correlated to her gender, I think in large part because she is an outspoken feminist.<p>I'm trying to be more outspoken about gender bias I encounter in the workplace, but incidents like this are a terrifying reminder of why that can be dangerous.<p>I'm not mad at Adria. The larger and more striking problem is how much hatred for women exists in this community and how threatening that feels.<p>If anything good came of this, it's that these biases are now coming to a head, right out in the open for all to see.",1363895846

If you're renewables generate the same amount of energy during their 'active' hours, that you consume in total, you have effectively arbitraged your use of non-renewables by carrying the load for others during the 'active' time and using their power during inactive times. The total amount of coal/gas/oil burned to create power for the 24 hr period is not affected by the amount of energy your datacenter used.<p>Given the drop in gas prices I expect that even in NC the power folks are considering changing/upgrading their power plants to burn that instead.",1363895821

From where I stand, it appears that very few people are mad that she said ""hey, PyCon, these guys are being annoying, can you send somebody over?"".

She was able to--and, I don't think it's unfair to say, <i>did</i>--point at them to many, many people, and attack them in a way that they can't even respond to effectively, let alone defend themselves if she happened to be wrong (and there's sufficient churn among the stories going back and forth that that's a possibility that needs to be considered).<p>That, I do think, deserves an apology.

I don't think that they are aware of some of the things they do that are offensive to women and I try to give them feedback to help them understand. I want my daughters to go into their career of choice and be comfortable in that environment.

Hi, I'm a woman in tech. And this upset me, but not for the reasons you think. I agree that Adria went too far in publicly Tweeting and ""name and shaming"" these guys. But the vitriol and hate that has spewed forth online to her is what takes my breath away. Comments calling her a ""cunt"" and saying she should be raped (this I found on her blog, presumably before she had a chance to delete it.)<p>I agree those comments are absolutely horrifying, and the act of people I would never associate with. However, I don't think it's fair to attribute them to the 'tech community.' This incident was linked to by extremists on both sides of gender issues, and I believe it's largely that community that was responsible for the worst behavior (many of the most egregious twitter accounts featured imagery that was taken from some of these extremist communities). These extremists on both sides have pre-existing ideological war that's been going on for decades and has intensified over the internet, especially recently, as they isolate themselves in echo chambers like private subreddits and tumblr cliques. Of course, there is some overlap between that and the tech community, but if this topic was only being discussed by people who had previously heard of PyCon, I imagine the tone would be far, far different.",1363895357

Even if you think the <i>way</i> she spoke out was not appropriate, you can't fire someone for this without running some serious risks of large lawsuits.<p>For anyone who's curious, the texts I'm working off of are <a href=""http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/retaliation.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/retaliation.cfm</a> and <a href=""http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/facts-retal.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/facts-retal.cfm</a>.

The remaining question is whether Adria has engaged in a protected activity and if that is what she was fired for.<p>The protected activity I think most closely matches what she did is, ""Complaining to anyone about alleged discrimination against oneself or others."" Now, in the case of this document, what they mean by alleged discrimination is any harassing behavior. But, I believe it is also typically only such behaviors by someone working at the covered entity.

Hi, I'm a woman in tech. And this upset me, but not for the reasons you think. I agree that Adria went too far in publicly Tweeting and ""name and shaming"" these guys. But the vitriol and hate that has spewed forth online <i>to her</i> is what takes my breath away. Comments calling her a ""cunt"" and saying she should be raped (this I found on her blog, presumably before she had a chance to delete it.)<p>As a woman in tech, I deal with sexism all the time. And it's usually not blatant, ""blah blah a woman's place is in the home get out of my office"" type of stuff. That's egregious and I would shut that down. It's usually less obvious. Like the guy at a conference I went to recently (with my fiance, Brian) who asked me my name, asked Brian his name, and then proceeded to spend 10 minutes talking to Brian and trying to figure out why he (who is a front-end developer at a startup) was at an entrepreneurial conference.<p>My fiance: I'm here because of Erica. (points at me)<p>Guy: Oh. But I don't get it. Why are you here?<p>Brian: She comes here because she's a successful entrepreneur and likes to hang out with other entrepreneurs. I'm tagging along with her.<p>Guy: Oh. But you're not an entrepreneur...so why are you here?<p>This went on like this for several minutes. Dude never said a single word to me, and finally wandered off, confused.<p>Or a more recent scenario at SXSW where I was talking to a huge, well-known tech big-wig (founder of a multi-billion-dollar tech company) who proceeded to make a flippant, condescending remark about his wife--and then stared at me, the only woman nearby, to gauge my reaction. Borderline sexist, but definitely unprofessional. What do I do? Do I call him out by name? Right now it's been a week and I'm still working out the best course of action. I'm horribly disappointed because this is someone I looked up to and hoped to have as a mentor.<p>These are just recent examples. I am hard-pressed to name a conference I've attended where one of these ""borderline"" sexist issues hasn't happened. Oh, wait, I can...the coworking conference I recently attended, where nearly 50% of the attendees were women.<p>Was Adria's reaction, to <i>this</i> as an isolated event, out of hand? Yes. But when this happens to you every single day--and in her case, multiple times a day!--sometimes you can't take it anymore and you just snap. I get where she's coming from, even if I wouldn't have done the same thing in her situation.<p>This doesn't portray <i>women</i> as badly as it portrays our entire tech culture badly. It's as frustrating to me as it is to anyone else. The blatant sexism is mostly gone, but the undertones remain. And that makes it harder than ever to gauge what the ""right"" reaction is as a woman when one of these events happens around you.",1363894491

There are so many extraordinary claims in the Wired article [1], that I found it all hard to believe.

That's insane -- I'm not sure if there is enough energy on this planet.<p>I also don't understand the cost-benefit ratio associated with actively spying on every transaction in the US. The vast majority of adversaries are outside the US, clustered in a handful of countries. I know that the US ran massive domestic anti-communism operations during the Cold War, but that would have been far cheaper than setting up a data center capable of capturing, storing, and processing every electronic transaction. (And even those Cold War operations didn't focus on <i>every</i> American.)<p>It reminds me of clients who think I can predict basically anything if I have enough data and computational power. Most of them seem to think that I can automate the process, that they don't need to be involved, that it doesn't take weeks of gut feeling analysis, and that it'll basically give them God-like omniscience.<p>I spend a lot of time educating customers about the limits of ""big data"".

So it's as much an emotional gut reaction as a logical one. )<p>I think this (desire for ubiquity/multi-platform) is the main reason I don't see eye-to-eye with the people who are pushing for web apps for everything. Web apps everywhere is great for large corporations that want to provide their service on as many platforms as possible. It's great for venture capital funded startups where the name of the game is to get as many users as possible and get bought out before your money runs out.<p>I'm a small indie dev though, I produce software (not software as a front end to a non-software business), and I'm not looking to become a billionaire (really!). I want to develop software because I enjoy it: to solve problems for real people, to solve my own problems. So really I don't care too much about being able to target every platform at once. I want to target the platforms I like, using the tools that I like, and as long as the platform has enough users to make it viable then I can do that with native software on open platforms (the latter is important and why I don't write iOS software, for example). There is the risk that the platform I target gets killed, but if a lot of people use it then that's generally going to be a slow process, and there is plenty of churn in web tech and standards anyway so it's not like it provides immunity to technological change. Additionally, I just have a hard time working with web technologies. I find them much harder to use, to the extent that if using html/css was the only way to write software I wouldn't be writing software at all and I'd go stack shelves in the supermarket instead. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to use them effectively, I don't know.<p>I guess this is partly the old 'software as craft'/'lifestyle business' argument, but it saddens me slightly that the big industry players are moving us away from the kind of industry where you can write software that interacts with some arbitrary bit of hardware in unsupported or unintended ways towards a much more controlled and profit orientated one (i.e. your software running everywhere being the most important criterion of all). Web people are not the only offenders here of course, but arguments against things like iOS have been well explored over the years.<p>Some people seem to view the web as some kind of beacon of freedom, the little guy fighting the big bad industry giants of Microsoft, Apple, Adobe and so on. But from where I am, the web <i>is</i> the big bad industry giants. Writing web software means being restricted to a very limited sandbox. The APIs available to me are decided by what a small cabal of powerful companies (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, Nokia and maybe a few others) can agree on. None of their interests align with mine (why would they?).<p>If Gopher had taken off and supplanted native development to the extent that people were using platforms that could only run Gopher apps, would the current web even exist? All user facing software being written to a single standard and API has good things about it, but it also limits new ideas tremendously (""sure you can add X feature you just need to get it through this committee of industry heavyweights first and get them all to agree, and then wait for them to ship it"").<p>What is important to me is that data uses open standards, whether at rest or in motion. If people control their data, and it is in open formats, then there is little companies can do to lock them in. Which is good for me as a dev since I can write software to help users work with that data. Web technologies don't do much to help me there, in-fact for the most part they have made it easier for companies to keep users data locked away on their server in unknown formats or behind proprietary APIs that I don't feel confident building software against. More concisely: email good, Facebook bad; FLAC good, Spotify bad.<p>I'm not arguing against all web sites/apps (or any hypothetical tech stack that offers a similar standard sandboxed environment). For some things it can be appropriate: wikipedia or hacker news or other inherently networked activities for example.  I'd prefer something less byzantine of course, but I expect that if the web apps model does take off then ways of targeting it that mean you don't have to think about CSS or Javascript will get more traction, in the same way that I can write native code without having to worry about assembly (most of the time). Javascript as a compilation target will become ""fast enough"" on most hardware for general purpose things (not for absolutely everything, but that is just another manifestation of the problem of not being able to break outside the sandbox when needed). So the technical issues of css/javascript being horrible are not the main problem.<p>I come from a social science background, which perhaps taints my view here. I look for the power dynamics that limit my real world ability to do things, and don't really care so much about theoretical ideas about a perfect world where everybody works together in harmony to make the web a platform that does everything you could ever need in a timely way. My issue is about power: who controls the APIs that ultimately lets software control your hardware and data? With open native platforms the answer to that is anybody. With the web it's the tech giants alone.",1363894087

5418119,comment,5325445,5417492,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"It's small usability issues more than anything specifically missing. Some things off the top of my head:<p>* The ""point to find in DOM"" icon is tiny and squeezed in between other icons at the bottom of the page. It's one of the most important tools, imho, and it can't be tucked away like that. And it needs a keyboard shortcut to toggle it.<p>* The ""point to find in DOM"" is very flickery and just <i>feels</i> more shoddy than Firebug's. Firebug uses a rectangular border, which I think makes more sense than a colour overlay which obscures the content.<p>* The DOM tree view is gnarly; by which I meant that it's cramped, squeezed together, hard to edit and navigate, and just generally feels like one is fighting a jungle of vines and branches. It needs more spacing and more a consistent editing mode. Firebug's isn't great, either, but it's more spaceous.<p>* The CSS style view is also pretty gnarly in Chrome. The hit area for the checkbox to enable/disable a property is tiny, for example, and the overstrike is black, whereas Firefox wisely grays out disabled items. Chrome uses these dividers which are completely unnecessary given the source information on the right.<p>* The action to add a property is to click somewhere inside the CSS view that is not text. Yes, to click. It makes no sense, norwhere in any user interface do you add stuff by clicking in empty space. Firefox more wisely uses double-click, even if that's not great either, but at least has some precedence in GUI history.<p>* Chrome has no tools to add styles. Firefox has a right-click context menu for CSS properties allowing me to right-click somewhere and select ""New property"" or ""Add rule"".<p>* Chrome: The icons in the lower bar change depending on which tab (Element, Resources etc.) you're in. Pretty confusing since some of the icons apply to the tab you're in, and some are always enabled (like the ""point to find in DOM"" button).<p>I could go on. But that's a start.<p>In fact, to illustrate some of these points visually, here are two screenshots of Firebug (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/A4ZD1x8.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/A4ZD1x8.png</a>) and Chrome (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/uVYbsxz.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/uVYbsxz.png</a>), each with the same height. Consider:<p>* Firebug shows in this case <i>all</i> the CSS information I need for the element. Chrome is information-poor in comparison.<p>* Chrome has inserted a useless ""element.style"" entry which is unnecessary unless you actually want to add style to the element; for inspection purposes it's superfluous.<p>* Chrome also wastes a whole line for the ""computed style"" part, which Firebug wisely tucks away in a tab.<p>* Chrome wastes the whole lower line on the DOM path, which I personally never use. In Firebug it's part of the DOM view and doesn't affect the CSS view.<p>Here's an improvement suggestion I'm surprised nobody has thought properly about. One thing I often need to debug is the flow between pages. For example, in some web app I click a ""Login"" link, get a login page where I edit stuff, then click ""Log in"", then the server does a few redirects and finally gets me to the ""you're logged in"" page. Now, Firebug and Chrome both have a ""persist"" mode for the network view which allows one to see the sequence of pages being requested, but since it's a strict log and mixes different content it's very hard to read, and very hard to figure out the true flow of events from. Here is such an exchange: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/aCs8pmF.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/aCs8pmF.png</a>. To get it I had to select the ""Document"" and ""Other"" event types. But I have to spend 10x as much time analyzing this than if I simply go to Firefox and turn on the stupid but effective ""Live HTTP Headers"" add-on and then copy everything into a text editor. The HAR is too cooked to give me a proper bird's eye view.<p>Truly what I wish for is some kind of graph that's page-oriented. Here is a very quick Illustrator mockup: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/pQqOtPX.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/pQqOtPX.png</a>. Obviously hovering/clicking on various elements would let you look at headers and what not. The idea is really a persistent timeline with a certain history, and which presents a <i>logical</i> view of browser navigation. It's important here to distinguish between user actions and stuff done by the browser (redirection, AJAX); it's important to know when something contributed to a page render or was just one link in a chain of redirects.<p>Again, I could go on, but I have better things to spend my evening on. :-)",1363893662

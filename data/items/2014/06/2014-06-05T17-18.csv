By this story IBM management, trying to satisfy the desires of shareholders looking for earnings growth, is destroying the company.<p>HBS is graduating lots of portfolio managers and analysts who contribute to this phenomenon. Not so many HBS grads in HFT, based on the folks I know in the industry.<p>HFTs certainly aren&#x27;t driving major global corporations into the ground by pushing for stupid forms of management like share buybacks, &quot;outsourcing&quot; core competencies, and the like.<p>I give this guy credit for referencing these impacts. I don&#x27;t think HFT is really part of that trend at all. HFT is actually pretty benign when you dig into the details. Sure, they scalp pennies here and there, and it adds up. But the competitive pressures on technology force efficiencies to a point, which is good for the market.",1401991199

They had so much potential when they launched and in the last year or so they have just fell behind. When they moved over to this new look there was so much functionality lost and so many critical bugs introduced that they still haven&#x27;t fixed.<p>Infinite scroll on their site is completely unusable, on the desktop and on the iPhone. Try to scroll past page 5 on either device and it will begin to slow to crawl, and then it will just start repeating pages of songs over and over. As you scroll, they load more and more elements until the page is using a ridiculous amount of ram. There is no playlist shuffle capability on the iPhone. The shuffle functionality on the desktop is a joke, it shuffles the current page of songs that have been pulled in via infinite scroll.<p>The whole site in general is very buggy. Many times I can&#x27;t scroll through my list of playlists when I try to add a song to a playlist. Sometimes I&#x27;ll like a song and it won&#x27;t register. All these things have made it become almost unbearable to use.<p>So between the non-working scroll and lack of real shuffle, it is impossible for me to access any songs I have liked when I started my account.

They&#x27;ll be adding improvements and no one will be using them.<p>Of course, since Swift is so tightly integrated with Objective-C and Cocoa already, Swift is already quite Apple-specific. And that&#x27;s what Apple really needs. A good language that makes sense for their platforms. We already have various incarnations of Mono and Java and what not compiling to iOS if people want cross-platform code.<p>But the lesson is there are always two sides of the coin here.

The final destination? It will enter a world entirely of its own — a world in which it is fighting to capture value that is completely independent of whether any is created in the first place.<p>I&#x27;d say the financial markets have been there for 6-8 years already.",1401990365

Prior to building this landing page to further validate my own assumptions on the need for this type of product, I conducted some user testing and interviewed 10-12 UXers and asked them a series of questions about their current use of personas in their workflow, time allocation to them as deliverables, feedback and iteration process, and pitfalls they experience while developing them. The takeaway for me was learning that UXers value personas as a tool for driving design decisions, but would welcome a faster more efficient way to create them, a better way to share and collaborate with stakeholders and speeding up the iteration process. So that&#x27;s ultimately what led me to the MVP feature set.<p>Obviously no product is a good fit for everyone, but if it solves a problem for enough people, its worth pursuing :)",1401989558

7852923,comment,7851927,7852587,6,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Criminals are the ones that failed.<p>In that case it&#x27;s even quite a bit worse than that. At least with bombers you can reasonably assume the Nazis will be doing everything they can to keep you from dropping bombs on them and the bomber pilots will be doing everything they can to not be shot down over Nazi Germany. That may not be such a safe assumption for criminals and law enforcement.<p>Plenty of &quot;criminals&quot; don&#x27;t even know what they&#x27;re doing is a crime. If the most common ways of getting caught are easy to avoid (e.g. don&#x27;t confess to the police or keep records of the crime) then the people you&#x27;re catching are not just bad criminals, they&#x27;re totally oblivious criminals. Which completely invalidates the theory that ratcheting up penalties will reduce crime -- no penalty can deter people oblivious to the possibility of them being punished. And publicizing the penalties may result in an increase in <i>actual</i> crime by encouraging previously oblivious criminals to take measures that prevent them from being caught. The result can be an apparent reduction in crime (i.e. a reduction in criminals getting caught) even though the actual result is that there are more criminals out on the street.<p>And then on the other side, the police and prosecutors have incentives to score political points to win promotions or launch a bid for political office. So whether you get prosecuted may have more to do with whether prosecuting someone like you is perceived to have political advantages (e.g. Lori Drew) than whether you&#x27;ve done anything that scores of people who haven&#x27;t been prosecuted have also done. Or as in the case of Wall St, whether prosecuting you is perceived to have political disadvantages (i.e. bankers withdrawing financial support), preventing prosecution of those who have demonstrably caused great harm for reasons having nothing to do with knowing who they are or being able to prove it.",1401988432

For those of us who found the NSA to be despicable before Snowden&#x27;s leaks, I feel like there was just a feeling of resignation that people just didn&#x27;t care (even in tech circles like HN). It was a similar feeling to \nthinking about climate change in the late 90s/00s.  I considered what you&#x27;re describing as a potential cause, but I ruled it out because of the HUGE disparity between the reaction to this and the reaction to the warrantless wiretapping scandal of the 2000s.  Wasn&#x27;t that spying on American citizens as well?  Why do you suppose that was essentially ignored by most people while this has become such a significant issue for so many?",1401988205

So how has ES acted against the interests of the American people?<p>It was a shock to many people including myself that the intelligence community would explicity violating the US constitution by conducting wholesale surveillance against all American citizens.

Further, since he stills ends up at the School with his friends alive in the present day, we know that a lot of character development has necessarily happened, because we saw analogous stories in the earlier movies from the now lost timeline. So while the events of the previous movies are now no longer canonical history, they are as real to Logan as they were to us, and their emotional impact still affected Logan&#x27;s life in a very real way. Meanwhile, going forward the script writers are no longer slaves to continuity, which, after the third film blew up everything, greatly restricted what they could do with the main cast of characters in the present day setting.<p>In my opinion, so many &quot;time reset&quot; plots (think Star Trek Voyager&#x27;s Year of Hell) leave the viewer empty because they truly have no lasting consequence on the character&#x27;s we love.

4255924,comment,4254958,4254958,3,0,andrewl-hn,,,"Oh, it was a God sent when it came out! I use it inside the company I'm working at as a part of video series that all developers new to JavaScript are required to watch (during office hours, actually). I also give some overview talks in person that address some particular details of the language and the ecosystem. Thanks to this video and some others my job became a lot easier in recent years.<p>So far I got only positive feedback regarding this particular talk. It goes in some peculiarities and gets quite deep at some points but in general it gives a warm welcoming feeling to people new to the language. And as such it's really great to show it to newbies as quickly as possible. Some of the developers have doubts about whether JavaScript is really a language worth learning. Especially those server-side people who heard quite a lot of great things about GWT. But after this talk many of them change their minds and at least decide to give JS a try. Alex is telling them: 
 - Look, here's JavaScript. It certainly can't do lots of things yet but it's really a nice language that is desperately willing to become your friend. Just don't be hostile to it and it won't fail you!<p>The part where Alex talks about inheritance with traits is particularly eye-opening for people coming from Java, .NET or PHP background.<p>At the moment Alex is more focused on Shadow DOM - a bit lesser known part of new web APIs - and he's overly a great guy and one of the most unbiased Google representative in standards bodies. I have a lot of respect for his work and wish him all the best.<p>Thanks, Alex!",1342537146
4255923,comment,4254750,4255858,7,0,_delirium,,,"I would say mixed opinions, but considerable skepticism. Some of the skepticism is of how university administration will handle it; there is some suspicion there is no real plan and this is being done for purely ""brand"" reasons, so the university president can talk about ""cutting edge"" initiatives. Some of it is of the concept in general. Some of it is that it's a for-profit company, not a nonprofit with clear charitable goals. Worse, it's a for-profit company whose business plan is still unclear, so one doesn't know what their long-term intentions are.<p>But a lot of people are just undecided, waiting to see how it'll pan out. Probably not a lot of outright <i>enthusiastic</i> professors, except from the relatively small number who are actively looking to either jump to one of these startups themselves (like Sebastian Thrun), or at least co-found one (like Daphne Koller).<p>The Chronicle of Higher education's occasional guest op-eds are probably a decent representation of the range of opinion.

His rig is, well, look at the pictures.  I also imagine it having a bunch of wires hanging off of it going to a backpack or something.<p>If he was blind he'd probably have a cane (well recognized internationally) or it would be obvious through interaction.  The people he interacted with, per his own account, had conversations with him, which certainly clarified that he was not impaired.<p>It doesn't matter if he is a university professor or the pope.  Both can behave as complete jerks and produce negative reactions on other people.  Pedigree does not imply common sense.<p>He should have GONE to the police immediately, not ""contacted them"" --whatever that means.  The fact that the embassy, police and consulate seem to have ignored him is a very interesting bit of data.  I don't know what it means.<p>It's a father on vacation with his daughter being so inconsiderate as to not leave his crap at home in order to enjoy a vacation with his family.  That alone paints a profile for me.  Sorry. I could be completely wrong, but I would not do that to my kids.  It takes a certain mentality to place your geeky needs above those of your kids for self-serving reasons.<p>If my oldest son was going around Paris shoving cameras in people's faces in public or private spaces and got slapped around I'd tell him to not be an idiot next time.<p>There is such a thing as behaving properly while in public and private.  Some might disagree, but I've taught my kids to not be loud at restaurants, while I see others that don't care about the rest of the people dining and let their kids be loud and not allow the table next to them have a pleasant conversation.

Always had it, always will have it. I think the goal here is to allow a lot of things to be smuggled but to keep the total dollar amount down. The drug trade is tens of billions of dollars, and it involves moving plants that grow as weeds. High-value art, rare fish, or any of a hundred other things really shouldn't be getting that much attention. There simply isn't enough money there to corrupt the system. The key problem (as far as customs goes) is rampant smuggling destroying control over the border. That's the problem to address. (I'd add that legalization would sure help a lot to address it.) We need to decrease the complexity of the customs laws and increase the focus of enforcement. Trying to ban something that huge sections of the population consume, or trying to control tens of thousands of random little items, are both ways to destroy the entire idea of having a customs office in the first place.",1342536506

I single out British because although they claim to a governance described as unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy they have some of the most decidedly backward understandings on race (esp race-based-class), ethnic origins (Highlanders vs rest), religious denominations (Protestant-Catholic strife) & the concept of nationhood in all of the western world.
For such a modern society their outlook on these matters is striking and confused.

Nowhere in there did I say that I would personally resort to physical violence.  I never have in my life.  Why are you reading more into it than I have said?<p>As for the ""don't be a dork"" bit of advice.  I am a dork.  Or so says my wife.  I am a geek too.  Now, the term ""dork"" can have many meanings.  Between dorks it is a little different.  When I am doing something stupid or overly geeky my wife will say ""You are such a dork!"".  It is not a pejorative at all.  It just means that you are being dumb in a geeky way.  Case in point:  We had a brush fire in a hill near our house.  I took out my RC helicopter, strapped a camera and video transmitter to it and flew it up about 800 feet (not over the fire, people, property or near full scale aircraft) to get a view of what was going on.  The fire captain even took advantage of what my video monitor was showing.  At the end of that my wife said ""You are such a dork!"".  And she was right.<p>> I'm waiting for you to get to the part where this justifies physical assault.<p>And you'll never see that.  Again, it's interesting to see how some are choosing to read my comments as though I justify someone getting beaten-up.  NOWHERE DO I SAY THAT.

If I go on vacation with my kids I go on vacation with my kids.  I might bring some work with me, but it is always in the form of a laptop for coding that I'll only use when they've gone to sleep.  I am there for the family and their experience, not to shove my dorky pursuits on their face 24-7.<p>This isn't even about marginalized groups.  IT IS ONLY YOU and others that are choosing to interpret the comments as such.  Well, get over it, none of what I said has anything whatsoever to do with marginalized groups at all.

Now if they were told there appeal for more money would take at least a year to be heard and in the meantime that they would not get paid anything until that appeal for more money.  Then that would of been karma and a fair approach.<p>Ironicly I know of three people who attended a ATOS medical.  One had cancer (turned out to be terminal), one had MS and the other had phsical injury including 2 fingers missing.  They were all deemed fit for work apart from the one who could clearly not hold a long-bow due to the missing fingers, least thats the funny take on it.  Do wonder if the French are still pissed that we let so called pesants goto war with longbow's and is the origins of the two finger jesture in the UK as a sign to the French we can still use the long bow.  Those captured by the French would have there bow fingers cut off and thus a display of those two fingers was born as a in your face gesture towards the French.<p>Back onto the offtopic subject you may be intersted to look up how many of those deemed fit for work have died shortly after there income was cut off.  If it was in any other country it would be called genocide etc.<p>This brings us nicely back on-topic in saying that descrimination of disabled people in any shape or form is more of a issue than race descrimination thesedays.  If people are asked about Hitler and World War II and gas chambers then they go on about the victimised Jewish people and how bad it was for them (and it was a bad thing).  Nobody mentions how disabled people were also given the same treatment.  Church's, many still accepted forms of estabilshments have and some still do descriminate against disabeled people.  Even hospitals.  This I have witnessed many times personaly and it is utterly disgusting.  There is one small plus side though.  That is you can more easily identify genuine people from those who operate such double-standards and in that can avoid them.<p>ATOS is mearly a knife edge away from being audited at a level that will embarass and shame them.

1. Choose an order for the four directions UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.
2. Choose a starting point and add to list, draw white.
3. Add all neighboring points to list in order chosen in step 1. The points that are already added (even if now removed) or would be outside are omitted.
4. Let n be number of points drawn white, m number of points currently in list. Remove the point at list index n%m.
5. Color said point white and goto 3.<p>In order to understand what is going on, lets first discount the conditions for a point not to be added to the last. Lets say they were added but ignored when popped. We would then iterate over every other point in the list, because for every step, we both increment our list index, AND remove one element. If the directions at index 0, and 2 were then non opposite (i.e. left - top), then we would flood fill in left-top direction. If the directions were opposite we would first fill a line.
Anyway, we need not go deeper into what would happen after that, it was just to get a feel for it. Because we actually have those two conditions for not inserting a point into the list. This could probably be thought as giving rise to a pseudo random disturbance in our index picking.<p>If this approximation is accepted the algorithm looks like this<p>1. Choose an order for the four directions UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.
2. Choose a starting point and add to list, draw white.
3. Add all neighboring points to list in order chosen in step 1.
4. Let n be number of points drawn white, m number of points currently in list. Remove the point at list index Math.floor(n*(1+Math.random())%m.
5. Color said point white and goto 3.<p>From this we can get a feel for what is happening. The reason we proceed outwards is that we the points we color are more and more recently added (i.e. further out). The reason for the gaps is that we a) effectively increase our index by 2+a random small integer.<p>The reason that we start filling again from the beginning is not explained by the random model, but can be understood from the fact that in the original algorithm, when we reach the borders, n starts increasing faster than m. This is because there is a high chance that added points are illegal. Since n increases faster than m, n%m will wrap around, and we start drawing points with low indices again.<p>I am not completely sure about these points: I have not tested them, but they seem a likely explanation.",1342534803

4255722,comment,4253427,4255590,4,0,coldpie,,,"Possibly, but their GPU drivers are also frustrating crap. Yes, AMD/ATI's drivers are far worse, but nvidia is still dropping the ball. Binary blobs in your kernel are bad for everyone. Kernel developers are often rightly uninterested in kernel problems that occur in environments that are ""tainted"" by black-box code. Nvidia's driver doesn't play nicely with the Linux GPU stack and ecosystem. Consider their ""twinview"" nonsense, requiring a legacy xorg.conf, and duplicating functionality present in the standardized xrandr 1.2. Fullscreen programs are an iffy proposition at best with nvidia's drivers, made even worse if you have multiple monitors, as a result of their refusal to work with the community and the standard tools.<p>A game developer as important as Valve officially supporting Linux has the potential to force nvidia to finally start playing nice, or even better, get their head out of their asses and just open-source their drivers and get them into the kernel. That way every nvidia user on Earth can benefit from an officially supported, open, community-driven driver.<p>Slim chance, but I would've said the same about native L4D2 if you'd asked me 2 months ago.",1342534291

Whilst contract law varies country to country, as a golden rule no contract is valid unless some money has changed hands.  Remember NDA's in many ways are poor mans patent protection and generaly pertain to company secrets that they can't patent.  Other instances would be if your doing a security assesment and have to sign a NDA promising not to publicly reveal what you find.  Also note NDA's have an expire date.  So if your not too happy with whats in the NDA dont sign there and then and get it checked, and if you are happy then don't sign and get it checked.  No NDA I have ever come across was written there and then and to be expected to sign it there and then is equaly not a good sign.

4255693,comment,4252046,4252618,1,0,idspispopd,,,"I agree, designing in pixels has always been the wrong way to go about it. It is only needed when there is a restriction in the number of pixels available to work with(such as displays that have large pixels.)<p>The beauty of high pixel density screens is that we can literally output our vectors/high resolution rasters to the output size and not have to worry about massaging individual pixels for the best clarity. The advent of high pixel density screens allows us to exclusively think in terms of the end size on screen, instead of being bogged down with pixels dimensions. This high density makes design easier, not harder. Also the concept of different pixel densities is not new, screens have always had different pixel densities.<p>The reliable thing about 'retina' screens is that we can think of the pixel problem as 'solved' and just prepare artwork to pass the retina test, instead of trying to match it perfectly for every higher pixel density out there. (A level of accuracy that won't be easily seen by the user.) The same thing is done in print everyday, 300 dpi, 600 dpi, 800 dpi, it doesn't matter, past a certain point the end user isn't going to casually notice the extra detail.<p>Designers that have been working in print would see the analogy to various print device resolutions which are each measured in lines per inch. Again the approach is to think in terms of the final dimensions, and not get bogged down with the individual device resolutions.<p>I understand that designing for 1x can be problematic, but it's the same workflow as designing for any foreign pixel ratio/pixel density (such as non square pixels used in certain types of film.) It's just another step in the work flow and testing often on a device is useful way for the designer gets the hang of it.",1342533826

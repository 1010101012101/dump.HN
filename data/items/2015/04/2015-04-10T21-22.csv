9357326,comment,9354614,9356307,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Mostly yes.<p>Many people follow an erroneous line of reasoning on this, though it&#x27;s understandable because there&#x27;s some subtlety and complexity involved.<p>We have been exploiting natural resources like crazy, which has depleted and will deplete many reserves over time, but not all reserves. Most importantly, the reserves that get exploited change over time due to capacity, cost effectiveness, and so on. Which means that there are many instances where particular reserves stop being exploited before they&#x27;ve been depleted, usually because they are too small or not high enough quality or too expensive to be competitive on the market.<p>Take coal, for example. There is still a huge amount of coal in easily mined locations all around the world that is not currently being used. If civilization had to &quot;reboot&quot; they could easily make use of those sources of coal. They aren&#x27;t being used at present because they aren&#x27;t competitive, they can&#x27;t produce the volume of coal at the prices and of the quality that the market demands currently. But there&#x27;s still tons of coal out there that you can basically just walk up to and dig out of the ground with a shovel. To some degree that same situation exists with a lot of other resources as well (such as iron ore).<p>Petroleum is perhaps the most likely resource to be depleted in the future, but even in that case there are still lots of smaller reserves that are easy to exploit but are not because they&#x27;re too small or too expensive.<p>Realistically the early stages of an industrial revolution in a civilizational reboot wouldn&#x27;t be significantly constrained, but later stages might be, though at that point they&#x27;d have options to work around it (for example, gasification of coal, earlier recycling, migration to non-fossil fuel power sources during early phases, and so on).",1428702995
9357325,comment,9355382,9356719,0,0,Jweb_Guru,,,"Yeah, I&#x27;ve thought about this approach in the past.  One problem is that it requires you to acquire the <i>same</i> locks in the same order.  That is, if you had Mutex<(X, Mutex<(Y, Mutex<Z>)>)>, you couldn&#x27;t acquire X, then Z, without first acquiring Y, but it would be perfectly safe to do so.<p>(Although, come to think of it, you can probably work around that with some cleverness; e.g., you could provide the option to access either the data protected by the Mutex or the next Mutex in the sequence through &mut; whichever you chose, you couldn&#x27;t access the other until you were through with the children.  You still have to keep the mutexes structurally in a linked list, though, which is obviously not ideal for all situations.  And you still need to deal with the fact that the reference to the first Mutex must be an &-reference, hence can be replicated indefinitely, which allows you to subvert the ordering guarantees; but this was already a problem, and I think there are some clever ways around this using rank-2 lifetimes).",1428702993

9357314,comment,9343543,9353126,0,0,titusblair,,,"Q: Why are you using a locking read on a million+ row table?<p>A: BigObject is row based storage as of current implementation.  There is a RW lock on the table to coordinate access.  Going forward as BigObject adopts advanced storage schemes i.e. column based storage, indexed row group, etc concurrency will naturally improve.  For this iteration, we felt that most query are READ/SCAN access, and a simple RW lock is sufficient for the performance gain we observed.<p>The bottom line is, BigObject is a collection of data structures that could operate on structured data sets in an efficient manner.  It is the foundation that we build on to provide new ways to address data analytic problems.<p>Q: Why are you doing a naive join between million+ row tables?<p>A: Here we are demonstrating a heavy operation that will scan the entire data set.  You could improve the performance if you know first hand what subset of data you will touch, and leave the rest behind, but so would BigObject&#x27;s performance.<p>Q: Is the point here that your product is better than a badly-implemented database on its own?<p>A: MySQL, PostgreSQL and other database systems are robust and well-maintained solutions.<p>Developers today develop applications with the premise that a database server must be present in their service, but could be using it for the wrong purpose.  BigObject is a middle layer for extending the capabilities and performance of databases whose role today are skewed towards general storage and retrieval while the original idea was handling transactions.<p>Arguably, you could tell people to use the right tools for the type of data and inbound frequency they are dealing with, but as a service provider and partner in Big Data Analytics, we have a responsibility beyond RTFM and snide.<p>We hope this helps address your questions.<p>Note: Questions answered via Jeff our product architect here at BigObject.<p>Additional Material if you are interested:<p><a href=""https://bitbucket.org/macrodata/benchmark-rdbms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/macrodata/benchmark-rdbms</a>",1428702875

I have been working out variety of approaches but very consistently for the past 14 years.<p>My current routine has me lifting free weights 3 days a week (M,W,F). Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press, Military (overhead) Press, Pull-ups, Decline sit-ups, bicep curls, leg curls on a machine to hit hamstrings better. Although I strive for a full body resistance workout 3 times a week - I will sometimes go light on all the exercises except one of them and really push that focus exercise.<p>Jog or run intervals on treadmill set at an incline twice a week.(T,TH). I generally go about 3 miles.<p>Rest on the weekend.<p>I do a form of intermittent fasting (16/8 or sometimes 18/6. Quit eating about 8 PM - don&#x27;t eat again until noon the next day or sometimes as late as 2.<p>Timing: I do my workouts at the end of my fast at mid-day before eating.<p>Diet: My meal right after working out is a giant multi-ingredient salad with a bit of protein.  After that I pretty much eat what I want but make sure to get solid protein with evening meal and generally another fruit or vegetable. I do eat dessert two or three times a week. I rarely snack between meals. I drink soda maybe once a week and then only 12 oz. or less. I basically don&#x27;t drink alcohol except for an occasional toast or one beer at a party. I drink lots of black coffee (no sugar or cream) I used to call this my vice and then the Harvard epidemiologists decided that black coffee and tea are both essentially health drinks - lucky me.<p>I feel stronger and better than ever as an adult - though I cannot run as fast as I did in my twenties. But admittedly my exercise program emphasizes strength much more than speed.<p>Mental well being: keep learning - that is almost a given for developers but I sometimes need to do something really different.<p>Relational well being: I take pretty good care of my wife of 31 years and she takes care of me. Lucky to have 4 great kids that enrich my life as well.<p>Spiritual well being: I actively participate in a local church which challenges me to think deeply about spirit and life. It also helps me get involved in helping others, giving to the poor and such. It also provides access to a rich circle of friends who share one or two things in common with me but are otherwise quite different.<p>These are the things that seem to really work for me.

There are, of course, many many other domain-specific ones, but that textbook is taught in the vast majority of data structures & algorithms courses, it covers most of what people would expect in an interview or in basic programming, and it teaches you how you might implement them.  The book itself uses pseudocode, but if you&#x27;re a halfway competent programmer you should be able to translate it into your language of choice.<p>(For a fun exercise, it can be interesting to translate them into a programming <i>platform</i> of choice.  For example, how would you implement a priority queue with an SQL database?  How would you do reservoir sampling?  How do you implement sorting on disk, where the dataset is >>> RAM size?  How do you implement a graph algorithm on a cluster of 5000 machines?  These are the sort of &quot;Google level&quot; problems that you end up facing in industry, but they require a full <i>understanding</i> - not just familiarity - with what the underlying algorithm is doing.)",1428702814
9357303,comment,9356496,9356808,0,0,munchbunny,,,"If you speak with actual Yale CS grads who are now programmers, I think you will find a very different story. Yale&#x27;s CS curriculum is quite the opposite of weak, but the department is certainly stretched thin on people to teach it because the administration hadn&#x27;t given the department the budget to hire more professors.<p>I was a Yale CS undergrad and the curriculum taught me quite well. The classes never taught me Rails or Node.js (trending when I graduated), but I did have a rigorous education in algorithms, systems, networks, firsthand practice with a variety of paradigms and concepts (functional, multi-threaded, continuations, etc.), plus the discrete math and graph theory to think about the concepts analytically. By all accounts that is a very thorough though somewhat classical approach to CS, but it certainly sets you up for long term success as a programmer.<p>If anything, the department&#x27;s philosophy is actually &quot;you don&#x27;t need pre-law to become a good lawyer, we&#x27;d rather teach you logic and make you a strong writer first.&quot; Having enough people to execute on it is a different story.",1428702806

Under &quot;soreness and injury section&quot; in Starting Strength Mark Rippetoe himself says &quot;...everyone who trains with weights will have: soreness and injuries.&quot;<p>Both Starting Strength and Crossfit utilize large compound exercises like squats and power cleans that can be difficult to master and my assumption is that more people have heard of Crossfit so I thought it would be useful for comparison.

9357215,comment,9355276,9356782,0,0,resu_nimda,,,"There was a submission on here a while about stenography and stenotype keyboards (actually it was about an open-source library for them called Plover [1]). These are the machines used by court reporters to achieve the fastest typing speeds (which in some ways makes them superior input devices that we could learn from). One thing that struck me was that over time each stenographer develops their own &quot;dictionary&quot; by essentially defining macros in the embedded software.<p>This got me thinking - what if we made a product like this that was given to children, that gradually mutated over time, learning from the usage? Ideally by the time they get to high school they would have these input devices that more organically map to their brains and they would be able to effortlessly type at extreme speeds. We might even be able to  solve the sharing problem if the configuration is pure software, like the keyboard with OLED displays in each button. But that also might not be necessary if they were portable/virtual/wearable such that it would be natural to carry at all times.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8510409"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8510409</a>",1428701390

9357200,comment,9347688,9354994,0,0,tel,,,"I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever heard of this concept, tbh. Categorically, you have arrows. Haskell is often modeled by the category Hask of types and arrows between types. If we denote these categorical arrows in notation as fat arrows then things like<p><pre><code>    Int, 
    (), 
    Maybe (Maybe (Maybe String))
    forall a . a -> a
</code></pre>
are objects and things like<p><pre><code>    Int => (),
    () => Int
    Maybe (Maybe (Maybe String)) => Maybe (Maybe (Maybe String))
</code></pre>
are arrows. Arrows are often called morphisms so you might talk about the morphisms as the elements of a Hom set like Hom((), Int).<p>Notably, the Haskell arrows, the type of functions, happen to internalize the categorical arrows. This makes Hask cartesian closed. Thus, we have a correspondence between the arrows<p><pre><code>    a => b
</code></pre>
and the objects<p><pre><code>    a -> b
</code></pre>
This is why we often talk about function types as being categorical arrows.<p>---<p>All that said, the type `m a` is not a function type let alone an arrow unless we happen to specialize `m` to be one. More specifically, the type `forall m . m a` is never a function type no matter the choice of `a`.<p>The notation `(-> m a)` or `(m a ->)` is... not actually a type. It&#x27;s a type constructor at best (though it&#x27;s illegal Haskell notation) which fits into a different kind of categorical construction if you want to go there.<p>The type `(a -> b)` &quot;is&quot; a valid arrow via the correspondence I mentioned earlier. The thing that&#x27;s being referred to is the fully applied type constructor. If we have<p><pre><code>   type Arr a b = a -> b
</code></pre>
then `Arr` is a type constructor of kind `(* -> * -> <i>)` (e.g. a &quot;type constructor constructor&quot;) and `Arr a` a type constructor of kind `(</i> -> <i>)`.<p>The </i>type* `Arr a b` is in correspondence with the morphisms of Hask. A combination of arrows would be a morphism from pairs of internal arrows to... something else<p><pre><code>    (a -> b, c -> d) => r
</code></pre>
we can represent that with an internal arrow<p><pre><code>    (a -> b, c -> d) -> r
</code></pre>
and then use the currying natural isomorphism<p><pre><code>    (a -> b) -> (c -> d) -> r
</code></pre>
which is the (internal) type of &quot;arrow combining morphisms&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s the clearest I can explain what I&#x27;m on about. Where do you fit your notion of categorical morphism into there?",1428701231

Then Rust was announced a few months later, and I thought &quot;wow, this is what Go should have been.&quot;<p>However, in the intervening time, Rust has diverged farther from Go. It no longer has green threads nor emphasizes message-passing based concurrency. In addition, Go was ready to use much sooner; by having a much simpler type system, and less ambitious concurrency story, Go has been ready to use and build up a library ecosystem for many years now, while Rust is only just now hitting stability to the point where you can write code and not have it break if you don&#x27;t constantly keep it up to date with the latest nightly.<p>So, I think that they are both valid strategies. There has been lots of good code written in languages which don&#x27;t provide as many safety guarantees or as strong a type system as Rust has; it&#x27;s not an absolute requirement for all code to be written with such guarantees.<p>By staying simpler and not trying to solve as many problems, Go has been ready for production use for quite a lot longer, and I think that there are many things for which it is still simpler and easier to use.<p>That said, I do prefer Rust now that it&#x27;s actually hitting a stable and usable state.

0.2 was focused primarily on improving platform security for ZooKeeper, Mesos, Marathon, and Consul.<p>Setting up security couldn’t be any easier. Simply invoke `./security-setup` prior to deployment and we take care of the rest, including generating SSL certificates for web admin consoles.<p>There are numerous other security enhancements-from dynamic firewalls that open ports based on discovered services to Mesos framework authentication to the beginnings of Consul ACL support.<p># Dynamic Configuration:
Consul&#x27;s service discovery, dns, and key value storage provide a powerful foundation for building responsive distributed systems. In release 0.1 we introduced a dynamically configuring Zookeeper ensemble based on consul-template. In 0.2 we extend dynamic configuration to haproxy, nginx and firewalls for Mesos and Marathon. In future releases, we&#x27;ll be moving more configuration out of Ansible and ssh to a REST API-centric system to provide a platform that can reconfigure itself with ease.<p># The entire 0.2 changelog is available at https://github.com/CiscoCloud/microservices-infrastructure/blob/0.2.0/CHANGELOG.rst<p>### What&#x27;s planned for 0.3<p>* Logging and monitoring<p>* Mesos + Consul integration<p>### Community<p>The project continues to see strong growth in contributions and deployments.

But every production language that I&#x27;m aware of has an out that allows you to escape its type system, with the exception of languages whose type systems are intended to uphold strong security properties and verification languages that feature decidable logics.  I can&#x27;t remember for sure, but I think even Coq--which is eminently not a language designed for everyday programming--may diverge if you explicitly opt out (though I could be wrong about that).<p>The questions, to my mind, are<p>1. How easy it is to opt out?<p>2. How often do you have to opt out?<p>3. How easy it is to write well-typed expressions?<p>4. What guarantees does a program being well-typed provide?<p>For example, you almost never have to opt out of the type system in a dynamic language, but the static type system is very basic.  In a language like Rust, you opt out semi-frequently (unsafe isn&#x27;t <i>common</i> but it&#x27;s certainly used more often than, say, JNI), and it can be hard to type some valid programs, but opting out is simple and the type system provides very strong guarantees.  In a language like C, you never have to opt out of the type system, and the annotation burden for a well-typed program is minimal, but the type system is unsound--being well-typed guarantees essentially nothing in C.<p>All languages fall somewhere along this spectrum, including Go.

That is, the quality of documentation is extremely relevant to product success.  Sadly, software is more often than not poorly documented, not only frustrating for potential users, but an unnecessary impediment to uptake of the program.<p>It appears the Rust developers are serious about describing how Rust works.

4649686,comment,4647069,4649572,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Well I don't think Bigfoot exists either. But falsifying that claim would require very careful investigation of the whole Maine landscape(or wherever Bigfoot supposedly lives).<p>This is your primary logical error, one that runs thorough your entire essay. No one can possibly falsify the idea that Bigfoot exists, because it would require proof of a negative, and proof of a negative is <i>an impossible evidentiary burden</i>. This is why scientists have adopted the null hypothesis as the core posture toward unresolved questions -- it saves huge amounts of pointless effort.<p>On that topic, you very clearly didn't bother to read the Russell's Teapot Wikipedia entry, so here it is again:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russells_teapot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russells_teapot</a><p>> Here is my take on experiential evidence ...<p>Don't bother. ""Experiential evidence"" is not evidence, any more than a horse chestnut is a chestnut horse -- meaning that the words we choose can't change the identity of the thing being described.<p>> I myself have had several experiences that led me to find some of Grof's ideas credible.<p>Where is your evidence? Subjective experiences are not evidence. Anyone can report personal experiences, but this doesn't turn them into scientific evidence.<p>Let's say that my ""personal experience"" is that women are dumber than men. Does this personal experience stand as an argument against gender equality and justify a change in public policy? Not in a society that either respects the scientific method or is able to think logically.<p>For a dozen reasons, science is not steered by anecdotes. If this were not true, I could claim to have cured the common cold, and here's how: I shake a dried gourd over the sufferer until he gets better. It might take a week but the patient always gets better. So, based on my personal experience, I deserve a Nobel Prize for curing the common cold, isn't that right?<p>> So I can sympathize if even this post does not convince you.<p>Want to persuade me? Locate some evidence. Evidence by its very nature is objective and repeatable. Personal experiences are neither.<p>You've chosen to live in a world ruled by belief, and you have every right to do so. But I think you may want to try to imagine how your defense of these beliefs looks to an educated person.",1350161969

4649682,comment,4649546,4649546,10,0,bobsy,,,"Interesting article. When you make an alternative to Amazon which has a similar selection and shipping time I will consider it.<p>I do not have a local book shop. My supermarket which is strangling farmers, killing off grocers, butchers, video game shops etc only have the best sellers list.<p>I have yet to find an alternative which is consistently cheap and delivers next day or the day after with free shipping..<p>To your points.<p>> Amazon publishes ebooks designed to attack your freedom<p>This is no different from music. I could choose to buy a physical book but sometimes I feel that my kindle could get it faster and I could save space in my house which already is littered with large books.<p>> Amazon's on-line music ""sales"" have some of the same problems as the ebooks<p>This is the same as a number of other music retailers. If I want to avoid this I will get a DVD. Just because Amazon offers you a convenient option doesn't mean you have to take it. I would rather save space in my house and save the environment by purchasing digital music than buy a CD which will be scanned onto my computer once then left on a shelf.<p>> Amazon's shipping in the US is done in a sweatshop<p>Oh well.. this is something state officials should look into. I have seen the UK distribution center a number of times on the news and it looks alright.<p>> Amazon cut off service to Wikileaks<p>Oh well.. it is Amazon's service. Wikileaks can use another. I use a service and I cut people off fairly often due to the content they post. They broke my terms -> They go. The end. They can build their own software. Or in Wikileaks case.. find another host / make their own.<p>> Amazon squeezes small publishers.<p>Amazon looks to give the best deal possible to the customer. Sometimes people get trodden on. If Amazon won't do you an agreeable deal go elsewhere. Make an organization with similar companies and reject any deals which you cannot agree to. Throw your weight behind a different ebook reader.<p>> Amazon doesn't just compete with independent book stores, it arrogantly seeks to destroy them.<p>Please.. there are app's like this which compare prices all over the place. Again. Amazon looks to give the best deal possible to the customer. When I buy from a bookshop I know I am paying more. That is fine because I can see the book, touch the book and take it home then and there. Most people know this.<p>Sometimes a local book store cannot sell a book even remotely competitively. An app which told me this would be nice. I don't mind paying a few pounds more in a store. When it is 5-10 there is a problem with the shop.<p>> Amazon appears to treat self-published authors well, but it can unilaterally cut the price of their books. And when it does, the authors are the ones who lose.<p>It is an authors choice whether they use the publishing platform or not. I wouldn't after hearing how Amazon auto-discounted an authors book and the author got screwed.<p>> Amazon censored an ebook that exposed how ebook bestseller lists can be manipulated (and therefore are meaningless).<p>Is this so unexpected? Guy tries to publish book on Amazon about how to game the Amazon review and ranking system...<p>> Amazon was a member of ALEC.<p>Oh well.<p>Amazon isn't a saint. They are responsible for putting a number of small businesses out of business. They damage the high street. However.. look at any major superstore. Its just the evolution of business. I will not be boycotting Amazon any time soon.",1350161942

If you think that's what's going on here it's because you're making the mistake of thinking that the market for personal enjoyment is the only one served by publishers.<p>The commercial loss, in this case, comes from the failure to pay for synchronization rights, which is a major source of revenues for artists and music publishers.<p>You may think this is ""stupid"" but that's only because you're considering this problem from your perspective alone.

4649669,comment,4648597,4649633,10,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"1. I could have raised my rate at any time, but I didn't until I read the book. If you haven't raised your rates for <i>seven years</i>, I'm guessing that you've thrown away six figures of lost income. I say this based on an assumption founded on the observation that something like 98% of freelance developers are undercharging for no reason at all. I was. You are. Even just taking inflation into account, you should be charging 20% more now, not to mention an increase in skills, tightening of the developer market, etc.<p>2. The ebook is something like 90-100 pages and includes a lot more examples, anecdotes, worksheets, and other practical advice than a blog post would. Like you, I've read tons of blog posts about this topic. And like you, I was lazy about raising my rates.<p>Honestly, I can't believe we're even having this discussion, given our rates and the leverage they imply. If I bill 1000 hours a year (I bill considerably more), every extra dollar in my hourly rate is worth ~$600 annually, after taxes. So if an ebook like this includes <i>a single sentence</i> that changes my thinking or behavior enough that I can justify an extra buck per hour, then it pays for itself 12x over in the first year.<p>Oh, and I used a $10 off coupon <i>and</i> I wrote the cost of the book off on my taxes, so it really cost me about $25. So it would pay for itself about 24x in the first year if I raised my rates $1. Again, can't even <i>believe</i> we're having this discussion.",1350161733

4649665,comment,4649422,4649641,8,0,jspthrowaway,,,"rsyslog's documentation is pretty abysmal, so you can't be faulted for giving up and doing something else. It's actually pretty extensive and useful, the documentation is just awful. Since he's hard at work on v7 I had hoped the documentation would get a little better, since rsyslog is better than syslog-ng in one way (you don't have to pay for local disk buffering), but alas, I'm left hoping.<p>imfile just injects messages from the tailed file as if they were read from another source. rsyslog just lists a bunch of sources, then dumps all the messages (based on filter) to a destination of your choosing. If, at the end of your configuration you have something like this:<p><pre><code>    *.* @@syslog-collector:514
</code></pre>
All messages regardless of source will be relayed to syslog-collector port 514. If it's an rsyslog receiving on the other end, try this:<p><pre><code>    *.* @@(o,z9)syslog-collector:514
</code></pre>
That enables experimental framing that rsyslog can understand, as well as zlib level 9. rsyslog will decode it on the other end just fine. Rainer will tell you to use RELP instead for relaying from rsyslog to rsyslog, but good luck getting it to work on any distribution. A minimal tail-and-forward config would look like this:<p><pre><code>    $ModLoad imfile
    $InputFileName /var/log/myapp.log
    $InputFileTag myapp:
    $InputFileStateFile myapp
    $InputFileSeverity 6
    $InputFileFacility local0
    $InputRunFileMonitor

    *.* @@syslog-collector:514
</code></pre>
That will tail myapp.log, inject messages as INFO on local0, then forward them to syslog-collector prefixed with ""myapp:"" on every line. It will not, however, collect the system syslog ... you need to prefix with this for that to happen:<p><pre><code>    $ModLoad imuxsock
    $ModLoad imkmsg</code></pre>",1350161638

I missed the date at the top and i scrolled up after reading this line.<p>> Google Wave team also chose to drop Internet Explorer support<p>3 years is a significantly long period of time in the browser world and Chrome was a 1 yr old browser and there was no IE9. Also, there was no windows phone 7.<p>Once in a few months, an article pops up telling how a startup saved $100k by not supporting IE or how hundreds of developer hours were saved by not caring about the things that IE failed to render properly. It narrows down to the number of users an app or service has and also the demographics of the users. If you are building a hipster social network or a video post processing tool, ignoring IE is going to save you significant time since it can be assumed that a good percentage of the users are going to be on macs using the latest browsers. On the other hand, if you are catering to e-commerce, finance or any other common industry even thinking about ignoring IE isn't wise at this point. With jQuery and graceful degradation, fixing the major issues shouldn't be really hard.<p>PS: Can just-launched-starup ignore IE for their app? Probably.<p>Can Pinterest ignore IE8? Of course not.

The system works around a concept called ""synchronization rights"", which pertain to the synchronization of sound and picture - which is exactly what's going on here.<p>Selling synchronization rights is a specific (and highly lucrative) line of business for artists and music publishers. That's what they're fighting to protect. They don't care if this was supposed to be commercial or not, any more than they care whether a commercial producer using their music in a feature film ends up making or losing money on the picture. They sell synchronization rights. You want 'em, you buy 'em. Or you get sued for infringing them. Those are your choices, that's their perspective in a nutshell, and they recognize no exceptions for ""personal use"". Right or wrong, the law is 100% on their side. Moreover, the fact that this video went viral and started producing actual ad revenue means that it is - regardless of intention - a clearly became commercial piece of media.<p>Again, the entire situation is completely outside anything that anyone imagined in the pre-internet age, which is when the market for synchronization rights was established. The culture is developing is ways the law didn't anticipate, and which the law, to my mind, should not obstruct. However, I don't think it's smart to pretend this isn't a synch rights issue when that's exactly what it is.<p>If EFF's object is to expand the scope of Fair Use to cover situations like this, and to create a precedent that demands publishers consider Fair Use before issuing take downs, then the issue of synchronization rights must be squarely addressed, not evaded by pretending that the audio track is incidental when that's demonstrably not the case.",1350160901

I really want to engage in a productive dialog.<p>I'll start from the top down with your post and explain how I feel and think:<p>Well I don't think Bigfoot exists either. But falsifying that claim would require very careful investigation of the whole Maine landscape(or wherever Bigfoot supposedly lives). In contrast, you could investigate your mind by taking high doses of tryptamines(<a href=""http://countyourculture.com/2012/03/10/n-alkylated-tryptamines/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://countyourculture.com/2012/03/10/n-alkylated-tryptamin...</a>) in a safe space and seeing if your experiences jived with anything Grof claims, or not. By the way the above url is very focused on quantitative information and the chemistry of some psychoactive compounds - no woo there don't worry. So Bigfoot is not a good analogy because investigating Grof's claims is an obtainable goal, not an impossibility.<p>I don't intend this to come off as snarky or rude, but I've been reading rationality literature myself for many years. Dawkins, Dennett, Russel, some Hume, LessWrong, etc. I've actually used Russell's teapot myself as a conceptual metaphor while arguing with naive religious people. I'm also a math major so I'm not exactly immune to logical thought. So please hear me out.<p>It seems like you are being triggered by the word astrology, this is very understandable and I normally associate astrology with bullshit myself. Let me shift my attention to some of the other things you wrote about experiential evidence.<p>Here is my take on experiential evidence. All evidence is experiential in the sense that we must use our sensory organs to use any machine or observe the world 'directly' but of course we really experience only what our brains construe from sensory bombardment of light, sound, etc. All this is quite orthodox so far as I hope you'll agree.<p>So, with various methods, high doses of tryptamines being the easiest and most reliable, humans can experience a variety of states that feel just as real, indeed often ""realer than real"" as everyday sensory reality. So by what basis except gut level feeling do we disbelieve in the reality of  dreams and believe in the absolute existence of waking sensation? It's really only that dreams feel vague and are hard to hold on to mentally and the real world is bold and seemingly objective because other people agree they experience it in similar ways. So much for the reality of the world and the unreality of dreams.<p>But there is a third category of experience available to humans and that is a visionary state. In such non ordinary states of consciousness people often have experiences that correlate with the experiences of others. So in this way it is similar to the situation with waking reality - independent verification of a 'territory' except that one is material and one is experiential/internal.<p>Secondly, as I've said before, often these experiences feel realer than real. Thus there is no reason to dismiss them out of hand, but rather treat reports and self-investigation as evidence of the same class as evidence from the material world. That said, we must be careful to avoid mistakes and confusion and make false theories based on evidence regardless of its kind.<p>Grof has taken large doses of LSD with sensory isolation hundreds of times and he has observed, for the full duration of the experience, over 5000 therapeutic sessions where LSD was used. He also had colleagues that did similar work and had access to their notes. In addition, many of the things Grof claims are compatible to a large degree with other researches who have used visionary plants and chemicals.<p>I myself have had several experiences that led me to find some of Grof's ideas credible. Specifically Grof thinks humans can undergo a state of 'cosmic consciousness', or identification with the Godhead, unitive experience, there are many names for it. I know for a fact this can happen because it happened to me.<p>Back to astrology. I admit I'd call bullshit in almost every instance I see the term 'astrology' but I give Grof a bit of benefit of the doubt. For one thing I believe he probably does not mean that the actual planets materially influence human affairs. But rather that some sort of periodic system that is analogous to the movements of the planets influences the internal world of our minds. I have no idea if this is true or not.<p>I think it's quite likely that Grof, as a modern pioneer of this type of research, has gotten some things wrong. I also think that he's on the right track to a much greater degree than conventional psychotherapists and psychologists with regards to the inner workings of the mind.<p>Why do I think this? Because of my lived experience both in normal waking life and in NOSC. Also conversations with friends.
Why does Grof think this? Because of his own extensive experience with NOSC and his work with thousands of therapy clients.<p>If that's not empirical then I don't know what is.<p>However, I would have completely rejected my own argument and taken your position years ago before I had sufficient experience with NOSC. So I can sympathize if even this post does not convince you.<p>Edit:
To use one of the standard atheist stories for my own benefit, consider the whole telescope and Galileo and the Church incident. Supposedly some thought that they mustn't look at the sky through the telescope and thus could dismiss any claims made by those who chose to look. Clearly in that case those who used the telescope had a privileged position, more accurate, and indeed incomprehensible by non-lookers. So I submit to you: NOSC are telescopes/microscopes for our interior world and if you only use your rational/cognitive mind you're essentially  missing half of the picture of what it means to be human.",1350159868

It is /tethered/, but not mapped, to sex.  They are in no way identical, and often, in so many ways, orthogonal.  Sex (ie, sex difference) has a finite number of dimensions, and the ones we can identify with confidence are physiological (currently, we understand neither the connection between neural function and behavior, nor the mechanics of culture, in enough detail enough to draw clear conclusions about what might really be ""male"" vs ""female"" characteristics in the realm of culture or behavior).  Gender, OTOH, has unlimited, fluid dimensions.  The prospect of discovering or creating a simple mapping between sex and gender, begets a vain project.  [Similar to the project of mapping Jewishness to thrift, ethnicity to ability, sexual orientation to morality, etc.]<p>Moreover, the process of peeling away the layers of what may be constructed / learned, or may be more-or-less dictated by genetics -- to varying degrees depending on an individual and a set of circumstance -- is /exactly/ the process of dismantling gender, which we can also hope will lead to a more equitable distribution of power.<p>So if one is sincerely curious about the underlying realities, keeping at chipping away the presumptions, is the way to go.",1350159525

4649528,comment,4649031,4649466,14,0,edanm,,,"That is an old meaning, which is slowly falling out of favor - it's very common to mean ""8 bits"" when you say byte.<p>Per Wikipedia - ""The size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size. The de facto standard of eight bits is a convenient power of two permitting the values 0 through 255 for one byte. With ISO/IEC 80000-13, this common meaning was codified in a formal standard. Many types of applications use variables representable in eight or fewer bits, and processor designers optimize for this common usage. The popularity of major commercial computing architectures have aided in the ubiquitous acceptance of the 8-bit size.[3]<p>The term octet was defined to explicitly denote a sequence of 8 bits because of the ambiguity associated at the time with the term byte.""",1350158765

4649526,comment,4649494,4649494,1,0,jfaucett,,,"I've been rumaging over this same thought myself and I think there's a real key point here that is sort of distinguished between in the article, mainly it boils down to just knowing your audience, but on a broader level I think its this: are you developing a web app or a website? For me, if I'm building an app I've also gotten to the point where I just ignore IE completely, mainly for reasons stated in the article (writing tons of work arounds that convolute the codebase, absolute lack of support for MANY features, etc). Also I think in most cases( it does depend) for most apps and their audience, very few are going to be using IE, so I don't really care about losing that 1% of my target group, especially if it helps me build a better app. For websites, sadly, the story is in most cases different and the majority of users will come from some version of IE. (Although, personally I've notice this changing a lot in the last year for my sites, we've been getting huge spikes in mobile - which yes, means no IE, so I think unless microsoft does something to take over mobile in 5 years devs aren't gonna have to worry about it.",1350158718

Marketing is mostly about deception and half-truths, and promoting a product effectively means maximizing the positives and minimizing/omitting the negatives:
""Look at this shiny car!"" (engine leaks oil)
""Buy our shiny lightweight computer!"" (can't change battery)
etc...<p>Good programming is the search for The Right Way to solve a particular problem, Truth if you will.  Marketing and sales seem to be about un-Truth.  It is little wonder that there are so many programmers who look at sales/marketing with disdain.",1350158685

I agree that it's pretty ludicrous today to have a discussion about why different races deserve equal rights under the law. But you're treating universal healthcare as being  on the same level in terms being a settled issue, and it's not.<p>I find it incredibly offensive that you equate someone believing that non-universal healthcare might be better economically for larger groups of people to someone thinking that enslaving black people is ok. Actually, I find it almost impossible to believe that you think they're equal. Do you seriously not recognize that there is substantial debate in the field of economics about this?<p>Mostly I just find it disappointing that you apparently can't do anything in defense of your ideas other than sling mud, because you lack either the ability or the inclination. You claim it's the latter; I'm happy to take you at your word, but I'd still prefer you not do it here.",1350158449

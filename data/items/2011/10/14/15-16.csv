They therefore <i>expect</i> (very) rough edges etc (of course, they also need some amazing order-of-magnitude breakthrough benefit).<p>BTW: the 3-year rule-of-thumb rings true for me too: a year to get the first customer (putting it out there and improving it for a year); a year to refine it/build the customer list; a year to make money hand-over-fist.

(like, what if you get 100's of error messages a second?)<p>We use a decidedly low-tech scheme. We log everything to files on local storage. Then we use a command line tool to periodically sync these to S3. Each instance gets its own folder.<p>When we want to query, we have several options. We can run good old grep or tail on one instance -- or on several instances with pssh. We can use the S3 command line tool to process multiple files on an admin machine. Or we could use Hadoop to mess with files in S3 (haven't done that yet...!)<p>Not as snazzy as having each log record stored in a structured fashion, but it's a lot cheaper than SimpleDB.",1318607938

When your wife uses proprietary software, she can never have any level of confidence that the software does what it claims to do and nothing more.  Microsoft or Apple can do anything they want behind her back, and the only chance she'll ever have of knowing about it is if some disgruntled employee decides to spill the beans and doesn't immediately get silenced by Microsoft or Apple's huge legal team.<p>But when she uses a program whose the source code can be examined by a worldwide community of programmers, her chances are greatly improved that if the code plays any dirty tricks someone will already have discovered the offending code, they will have screamed bloody murder, and the offending code will already have been removed.  Even if she's unfortunate enough to have encountered the malicious code before it's been discovered, she can be confident that when it is discovered: 1) it will quickly be fixed, and 2) since it's in Microsoft's and Apple's interests to disparage F/OSS software, it will be prominently reported on the 11:00 news.<p>I'm certainly not claiming that there's any absolute guarantee that any software is safe.  If you really want to be paranoid, read Ken Thompson's ""Reflections on Trusting Trust"" at <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.167.4096&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.167...</a>.<p>But I am claiming that her chances of being harmed by having her data misused are far, far greater when she uses software that can only be examined by a very few programmers inside an organization that has a vested interest in hiding the misuse.  She's much safer when she uses software that can be examined by a worldwide community of programmers whose vested interest is in achieving status within the programmer community by producing code they can be proud of.",1318607751

The polished nature of a proprietary operating system is like a polished jail.

You can access the filesystem, but you can't install your own free (or proprietary) operating system on the iPhone because there isn't one.<p>Free software isn't all about nice looking features (though they tend to get developed in time), it's largely about creating a dynamic that ensures the freedom of the user, and that protects them from anti-features, both blatant and subtle.

I don't expect everyone to be an early adopter of every free technology, but there are many, especially at HN, who would be able to use them and to help them grow to the point where most people would be able to use them quite easily.

3111573,comment,3110889,3111256,16,0,lutorm,,,"I think this is the issue: The time is given by the GPS satellites sending out a signal. This signal is received by the two ground stations, who reset their time accordingly. This means that the two ground station clocks will define two events as simultaneous <i>in the frame of the satellite</i>. But the measurement is done in the ground frame. Two events that are simultaneous in the satellite frame are <i>not</i> simultaneous in the ground frame, due to the relative motion of the two frames. In the ground frame, there will be an offset between the two clocks, and that would, unless corrected for, result in a skewed measurement of the time of flight.<p>In reality it's more complicated, since there is no one ""satellite"" frame. The GPS system determines position and receiver time from a global solution to all the satellites. Since GPS time is claimed to be accurate to something like 10ns, it seems the only way this would be possible is if the GPS solution has been constructed to specifically refer the frame of the observer, which would be a ground stationary frame.<p>Is there someone with more intimate knowledge of the GPS algorithm that might be able to comment on this?",1318606681

Are they all just randoms that sign up to your service? How do I know they're not crazy axe-murderers? Are they taken from Facebook or some such? Do we pay to join? Do we pay to send messages? Let's say I set up and event: Do I just ping people and ask if they want to go? Or does my event get listed and other people say they'd like to turn up? What happens if Bob (a made up name) has been to an event and I HATE HIM? Can I not let him see events I create? Can I filter events Bob goes to?<p>We have no selection criteria when it comes to signing up for the service. Just like many of the public events you might attend such as concerts, HN meetups, bowling leagues, Reddit meetups, or even church groups are consisted of randoms that sign up for that service. As for crazy axe-murderers- there's no way to know for sure. But the same could apply to your landlord, your roommates, your local barista and even your next-door neighbor.<p>Users have an ability to connect via Facebook but it will be optional. It's free to join, free to send messages via the message board. Your event automatically gets listed in your local area where other people RSVP for it if they're interested in meeting you.<p>As of our first version, we don't plan on having any blocking or filtering features in place. Like any other service such as meetup, grubwithus, or reddit, you can't control whether or not other people show up to your event. If you have concerns about your safety and privacy, it would be best to apply common sense and notify your local law enforcement. If it is still a concern, you can choose to participate in events farther away from your local area or limit the number of people who are allowed to join your event(decreasing the chances that Bob will be one of the attendees). Bob has no way of knowing what events are created by you or what events you have joined unless Bob personally checks each and every event made in all the cities in the database.<p>I hope I've answered your questions and resolved your concerns.

X<p>This makes a very round ellipse centered at the origin with its size determined by the initial point. epsilon determines the angular velocity of the circulating point, and slightly affects the eccentricity. If epsilon is a power of 2, then we don't even need multiplication, let alone square roots, sines, and cosines! The ""circle"" will be perfectly stable because the points soon become periodic.<p>The circle algorithm was invented by mistake when I tried to save one register in a display hack! Ben Gurley had an amazing display hack using only about six or seven instructions, and it was a great wonder. But it was basically line-oriented. It occurred to me that it would be exciting to have curves, and I was trying to get a curve display hack with minimal instructions.<p>ITEM 150 (Schroeppel):\nPROBLEM: Although the reason for the circle algorithm's stability is unclear, what is the number of distinct sets of radii? (Note: algorithm is invertible, so all points have predecessors.)<p>ITEM 151 (Gosper):\nSeparating X from Y in the above recurrence,<p>X(N+1) = (2 - epsilon^2) * X(N) - X(N-1)\nY(N+1) = (2 - epsilon) * Y(N) - Y(N-1).<p>These are just the Chebychev recurrence with cos theta (the angular increment) = 1-epsilon^2/2. Thus X(N) and Y(N) are expressible in the form R cos(N theta + phi). The phi's and R for X(N) and Y(N) can be found from N=0,1. The phi's will differ by less than pi/2 so that the curve is not really a circle. The algorithm is useful nevertheless, because it needs no sine or square root function, even to get started.<p>X(N) and Y(N) are also expressible in closed form in the algebra of ordered pairs described under linear recurrences, but they lack the remarkable numerical stability of the ""simultaneous"" form of the recurrence.<p>ITEM 152 (Salamin):\nWith exact arithmetic, the circle algorithm is stable iff |epsilon| < 2. In this case, all points lie on the ellipse<p>X^2 - epsilon X Y + Y^2 = constant,<p>where the constant is determined by the initial point. This ellipse has its major axis at 45 degrees (if epsilon > 0) or 135 degrees (if epsilon < 0) and has eccentricity<p>sqrt(epsilon/(1 + epsilon/2)).<p>For the full MIT HAKMEM (a report everyone who programs should read at some point) <a href=""http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/hbaker/hakmem/hacks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/hbaker/hakmem/hacks.html</a>",1318605674

So is this saying that the ground stations set their clocks initially wrong because of their relative movement to the satellites? If so, wouldn't this be proven out by comparing the neutrinos time to the time of a photon? If so, wouldn't this be proven out by comparing the neutrinos time to the time of a photon?<p>Actually, the satellites and ground stations are accelerating relative to each other, since they're moving in(roughly) circular paths.  Acceleration only means that the velocity vector is changing relative to the frame of reference.  It doesn't mean that the absolute velocity is changing.<p>The problem is that the GPS satellites are the ones keeping time, not the ground.  The ground stations are effectively \n""reading"" the clocks on the satellites.  So all of the relativistic time calculations should be done from the satellites' frame of reference, rather than from the ground stations' frame.  The satellites are moving from west to east(with the Earth's rotation) with an orbital period of approximately 12 hours(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation#Comparison_of_systems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation#Comparison...</a>).  Their rotational velocity, relative to the center of the Earth, is twice that of the  ground stations.  In terms of absolute velocity, they're moving quite a bit faster.  Since they are doing the timekeeping(and assuming that neutrinos move at c regardless of the frame of reference), the receiving ground station is moving towards the initial origin point of the neutrino stream.  At that point, it's a doppler effect calculation taking into account the relative velocity of the ground stations to the satellite's frame of reference to find the offset.<p>Also, the photon time measurement isn't possible due to the curvature of the Earth and the fact that the receiving end is underground.",1318604893

While we usually don't have much control at the hardware level, I personally don't want to use an operating system that is defective by design <a href=""http://www.defectivebydesign.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.defectivebydesign.org/</a> , with forced obsolescence just being one example of a dirty tactic that is often used. (Get the latest phone, the previous one isn't cool anymore and the new OS works like crap on your ""old"" hardware!)<p>If it weren't for Firefox, there would hardly be any web standards to speak of, and the internet would basically cater to Microsoft Windows' Internet Explorer. Microsoft resisted the development of the internet in its current form because it allows users of virtually any operating system to use the web to its fullest potential. I don't think Apple is very much above that kind of thinking. When there weren't many apps for the iPhone, Apple touted the idea of web-based apps, because it was an easy entry point, and there weren't many binary alternatives in the ""ecosystem"". Once there were lots of programs in Apple's (censored) store, they began discouraging the use of web-based applications and encouraged everyone to make programs compiled for the iPhone, largely because a user of any device can use a web-based app, but you have to buy an iPhone to use the any of the programs that have been written by programmers for that device. (No cross-compiling allowed by Apple, btw.)<p>So whether or not we like where development is heading with a given free software project, there is a sanity to the development process in that there are no anti-features that I can really think of. If any get made, then all it takes is _one_ programmer to say, ""I don't like that idea, I'll just delete that code and share the change with others, because it suits me, and because I can.""<p>edit: spelling",1318604658

For example, table manners are different in Europe and the US (the way you hold and use a knife and fork especially). Also, since people in the uk drive on the left the way they look for cars before crossing a road is opposite the norm in countries where they drive on the right. Apparently Americans will rotate a piece of pie or cake so the point faces them before eating it.<p>It should be possible to specifically train some habit or combination of habits that is within the norm but notable enough to use as an identifier if known (much like baseball signals).<p>In short: behavioral steganography.",1318604464

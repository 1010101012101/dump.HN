8637780,comment,8635887,8637484,0,0,austenallred,,,"Facebook, the product, is no longer this super sexy app that college kids are checking out. Looking for Facebook to be that, you will probably predict its future demise.<p>But that&#x27;s not what Facebook <i>is</i> anymore. Facebook is the social graph expressed in Internet form, and is so interwoven with the fabric of the Internet that it&#x27;s difficult to avoid, even if you&#x27;re intentionally doing so.<p>Some products phase in and out, that&#x27;s for sure. I think Zuck&#x27;s realized the potential for that to happen, and once he got on the top of the totem pole began preparing for it. He turned FB from an app into a social graph and API that is everywhere, and now he&#x27;s paying from $1B (Instagram) to $19B (WhatsApp) to get some of his biggest would-be enemies to join him. He does not screw around with the Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma.<p>I&#x27;ll be the first to admit I <i>despise</i> my current Facebook feed. It&#x27;s full of clickbait articles mingled with the occasional update from someone whom I may or may not care about. That being said, I have tried to delete Facebook multiple times, and to no avail. I still have my hopes that they&#x27;ll change the algorithm a bit and kill the effectiveness of the clickbait to the same extent they killed the spamminess of those social games and widgets. (Although they still exist and are annoying, they&#x27;re an order of magnitude less annoying than they used to be.) But, despite my best efforts to avoid it, I still check my Facebook feed at least daily.<p>What pulled me back? At first, it was that Facebook was integrated with Spotify. I had to create a new account and build up all of my playlists, songs, etc. from scratch. That was kind of a pain. Then I deleted Facebook again. I ended up missing a party that was <i>only</i> planned on Facebook. Then I missed the news that a friend was engaged, and another friend was pregnant. Then I couldn&#x27;t log into my Kiva account to redistribute the repayments I had received because I had used Facebook to sign up. Facebook is just an incredibly, incredibly sticky product. Network effects are a bitch.<p>Sure, hackers will say, &quot;Well your friends should have called you instead of putting it on Facebook.&quot; But they didn&#x27;t. Even though I&#x27;m not in college, if I&#x27;m not on Facebook I&#x27;m missing the party. (Even though &quot;the party&quot; is now simply knowing that my friend finished med school and is moving to Michigan.)<p>Facebook isn&#x27;t as sexy as it used to be, but it has become increasingly difficult to avoid. Think about that - we have to figure out ways and work hard to <i>avoid</i> a product. That&#x27;s why a significant proportion of the Internet&#x27;s users log in to Facebook <i>every day</i>. Unless some major shift takes place, Facebook isn&#x27;t going anywhere anytime soon.",1416513432

This seems strange to me, because public posts can be readily seen with a browser.<p>I think that it&#x27;s the amalgam of many small, seemingly innocuous design decisions like this that slowly undermine a company&#x27;s credibility.<p>I just mean, if even the most basic features cause users grief, then I don&#x27;t have confidence in anything beyond that.  The same goes for issues with Netflix (closing API), Twitter (throttling), even Google (too much power over a site&#x27;s livelihood, no support) and Apple (constant deprecation of APIs and broken documentation links).<p>I&#x27;m not sure anymore how these companies will be able to stand against free and open competitors, which is why I see us soon entering a brave new world where openness will be crushed by legislation from lobbyists.

If waterfall is the process that produces good results for the set of people you have working on the problems you are addressing, then <i>waterfall is Agile</i>.<p>What you say is about sprints is accurate about Scrum, but while an Agile shop might use (and especially start with as a baseline) Scrum, Scrum is not the same thing as Agile.<p>There&#x27;s a good reason to argue that not committing to requirements at some point so that work can proceed directed at a fixed target is suboptimal in the general case, but arguing whether its Agile or not -- and even moreso describing Agile as definitively being up front at some specific level, is confusing metamethodology with methodology and reducing Agile to a fixed methodology, of which it is very much the antithesis.",1416513305

That&#x27;s why the Kinsey reports of the late &#x27;40s and &#x27;50s were so shocking.<p>What I want is the freedom to not have to keep my entire sexuality private, not the freedom to have whatever sort of private sex I can get. Those are different things. JFK could have extramarital affairs as could his father, Joe Kennedy. People know about it. But because they were privileged, upper-class white males with political power, they could away with it.<p>While there are still people who today can lose their jobs for having pre-marital sex. For example, <a href=""http://www.10news.com/news/woman-sues-san-diego-christian-college-claims-she-was-fired-for-having-premarital-sex-021413"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.10news.com/news/woman-sues-san-diego-christian-co...</a> .<p>In that case, San Diego Christian College&#x27;s &quot;contract, in part, says &quot;… sexually immoral behavior, including premarital sex, adultery, pornography and homosexuality …&quot; are not allowed.&quot;<p>This is clearly a counter-example to your statement that &quot;pretty much everyone in the US&quot; has the freedom to have all the sex they want.<p>Same for <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/02/catholic-religious-schools-fired-lady-teachers-being-pregnant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/02/catholic-religio...</a> . &quot;Firing unwed teachers who become pregnant is not uncommon for private religious schools. It&#x27;s not necessarily illegal, either. Although federal law generally forbids discrimination against pregnant women, the Supreme Court has ruled that religious employers are protected from certain discrimination lawsuits brought by employees who serve in ministerial roles.&quot;<p>Or here&#x27;s a &quot;prison guard fired after having sex with convicted wife-beater on parole&quot; <a href=""http://www.ottawasun.com/2014/09/18/prison-guard-fired-after-having-sex-with-convicted-wife-beater-on-parole"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ottawasun.com/2014/09/18/prison-guard-fired-after...</a> . In that case it&#x27;s likely an abuse of power issue, but it&#x27;s still a restriction on having sex.<p>The challenge is to show that &quot;the freedom to have all the sex you want&quot; is any more prevalent now than during the free love era the (re)bloomed in 1960s, or the sexual promiscuity of the 1970s. (Eg, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco#Drug_subculture_and_sexual_promiscuity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco#Drug_subculture_and_sexua...</a> )<p>I have a book, written in the 1970s, which says something like &quot;kids these days consider a handjob about as commonplace as a handshake.&quot;",1416512851

I think the monetization goals of Facebook are also starting to impact the usability and enjoyability of the site.<p>2. Brand issues. Why is Facebook not cool anymore?  Is it simply due to ubiquity?  Can they regain that credibility?  Is the &quot;youth market&quot; a lost cause for them?<p>3. The potential for competition in the space.  Building a social network seemed like a lost cause battle for many years because it is essentially &quot;owned&quot; by Twitter and FB - and nichely LinkedIn - (at least in the U.S.)  For all its many, many (stress: many) flaws, ello showed one thing: people are clamoring for something other than Facebook.  Now ello is really a bad approach at this, it feels like a weekend project rooted in one thing: to make sure it could never make money.  But I get all that.  Even a site with no clear or dependable direction, with atrocious design could generate a lot of interest with some false scarcity.

In fact, they were invented  by the same group [3].<p>On numeric keypads, each button corresponds to ~3 letters. Basic text entry involves pushing each button multiple times to select the index of the letter you want[4], then waiting to confirm the selection before moving to the next character.<p>T9 sped up this process by allowing you to press each button once. It would determine which word you meant by comparing all possible combinations of letters that could be created from the buttons you pressed against a dictionary of known words.<p>Swype provides a similar extension to QWERTY touchscreen keyboards. With Swype, you drag your finger across a QWERTY grid, creating a path. This path starts on the first letter of the intended word and crosses all letters in the word, in order. It also crosses lots of letters that aren&#x27;t in the word, or are out of position. The &#x27;secret sauce&#x27; lies in how to compare the ordered set of keys defined by the path to a predefined dictionary and produce a meaningful prediction of the intended word.<p>I haven&#x27;t implemented such an algorithm myself. However, you can imagine how it might be done. For example, acute angles in the path probably occur when you reach a letter you want, then angle off to collect the next letter. This provides a signpost that can be combined with the initial letter to reduce the possible words down to the set that starts with the initial letter and includes the key with the acute angle.<p>[1] First introduced by Swype: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swype"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swype</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/24/swype-vs-iphone-typing-sw_n_368850.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/24/swype-vs-iphone-typ...</a><p>[4] e.g. the &quot;3&quot; key corresponds to &quot;DEF&quot;, so press &quot;3&quot; twice to enter &quot;E&quot;",1416512192

Partly it&#x27;s because we compare the complex and diverse families of the 1900s with the seemingly more standard-issue ones of the 1950s, a unique decade when every long-term trend of the 20th century was temporarily reversed. In the 1950s, for the first time in 100 years, the divorce rate fell while marriage and fertility rates soared, creating a boom in nuclear-family living. The percentage of foreign-born individuals in the country decreased. And the debates over social and cultural issues that had divided Americans for 150 years were silenced, suggesting a national consensus on family values and norms. ...<p>> But much nostalgia for the 1950s is a result of selective amnesia-the same process that makes childhood memories of summer vacations grow sunnier with each passing year. The superficial sameness Of 1950s family life was achieved through censorship, coercion and discrimination. People with unconventional beliefs faced governmental investigation and arbitrary firings. African Americans and Mexican Americans were prevented from voting in some states by literacy tests that were not administered to whites. Individuals who didn&#x27;t follow the rigid gender and sexual rules of the day were ostracized.<p>The 1950s also had the &quot;curse of capitalism&quot;. All of the new processed food companies want to get in on the action, after the rationing of the war. Look at <a href=""http://thehairpin.com/2013/10/lets-eat-some-weird-shi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thehairpin.com/2013/10/lets-eat-some-weird-shi</a> and see just how many ways the free market was trying to convince people in the 1950s to add a bit of their branded processed food to a recipe. &quot;Fill the center of the peaches with Miracle Whip.&quot; &quot;Split frankfurter buns in half and spread with Kraft Mayonnaise. Fill with good thick strips of Velveeta and brush the tops of the buns with melted butter or Parkay Margarine.&quot;, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t see any awareness of these issues in that essay, which makes it very frustrating to read. It comes across like a specific, typically conservative viewpoint which emphasizes a certain hierarchical conformist culture.",1416510614

Is having your (and your co-workers) desktops/laptops/and possibly more directly able to access production servers at a packet level a good idea?<p>I would posit that it is not.  A bastion host can be used to lock down more than firewalls, and reduces the attack surface living on your network considerably.<p>> VPN terminator in the VPC serves the same purpose as a jump box.<p>It certainly serves the same network separation purposes a jump box does, but is not able to dictate the access environment nearly as much.  If only your jump box has access to servers (and production servers properly filtered), every bit of remote access must go through that single ingress/egress point.  And that point can have security policy built-in as well for multi-person teams.  For example:  I can enforce certain key types being utilized on remote hosts, logging of ssh sessions, etc.<p>I also agree the &quot;single packet authentication&quot; is silly though.  Most bastion hosts these days will be behind VPN already.  Just another riff on port knocking really.",1416510191

Eventually it sinks in that some of those somethings will always be left undone.  There will be no time for them.  This feels like a loss, and letting go is hard.<p>One other side to this, even within our chosen area(s) of interest that we have worked hard on:  Unless we are very unimaginative, we all ultimately must fail, despite many successes.

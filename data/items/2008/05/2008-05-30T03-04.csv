204029,comment,203237,203525,0,0,hugh,,,"I disagree. Spam has a low success rate, so it's only extremely profitable when the cost per advertisement is zero. If you have a service where it costs _any_ money to post then spammers will go find somewhere else.<p>I think it could work well for classified ads since that's something people are willing to pay for. Not so well for wikipedia or social news, because who cares enough to pay money for those?<p>I'd price classified ads at one dollar each -- small enough that it's practically free, but large enough that you could easily make a lot of money out of it if people ever decide to abandon craigslist.",1212119838

204012,comment,203864,204001,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"Basically, Adobe Livedocs, and trial and error. Although from a rendering perspective just knowing the theory behind it (write code to just rotate an image without concern for quality and it's instantly clear that it'll always be slow) gives you pretty much everything you need to know - it's just connect the dots from there.<p>Also, Flex Builder is a bit of a dud, but its profiler is <i>very</i> good. If you can afford it, it will give you very good insight into your code bottlenecks, if the $$ is worth it just for that. I use FlashDevelop to edit in still.<p>P.S. Sorry if I'm hating on Flash a bit too much throughout my posts. There were a few trivial bugs with serious implications that directly delayed our release, so I'm still quite annoyed. I'm back into Flash for the next project, though, because customers are more important than development comfort!",1212117391

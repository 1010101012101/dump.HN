6145241,comment,6141641,6143162,0,0,zanny,,,"I still don&#x27;t like the regimented age-based education heirarchy, which Europe still subscribes to. Beyond basic skills for human interaction (an understanding of the dominant language, basic arithmetic, necessary social skills like knowing traffic signs, what emergency lights mean what, how to calculate taxes, how interest rates work, and some basic history of the world and the local country) the most important thing is getting them interested in learning <i>more</i>, but it has to be by their own will, or else they won&#x27;t absorb the information you try to force down their throats. The best way to do that is through exposure - I can easily see children aged 6 - 12 going through a school system where half their day is learning basic requirements to function in society (and none of the really unnecessary things for basic interaction like 18th century literature, ancient civilizations, trigonometry, and the number of electron orbitals on Iron) and the other half is exposure to professions, concepts, and ideas (go to a museum, go to a baseball game, go watch the local smelters forge aluminum, observe a busy intersection and discuss traffic patterns). In other words, to expose them to and enable them to explore a broader spectrum of the world than sitting behind decks looking at a chalkboard reading from a book and writing down notes to repeat on a test and forget the next day.",1375415856
6145240,comment,6144826,6144989,6,0,colinsidoti,,,"The glory of this system is that WP retains their stupid easy install.<p>I suspect they pull down the data for whether a cron needs to be run in an initializing query that also pulls down a ton of other data (site name, for example).  So in theory, they&#x27;re only doing a few time comparisons of extra work per request.<p>Also - I haven&#x27;t looked too deep into WP&#x27;s implementation, but are they actually doing it on page load?  I&#x27;ve seen it in other php software (I believe phpBB) as a 1px image.  This kinda solves the caching issues others are talking about...your server might still get hung up, and that picture might never load, but if you&#x27;re cached properly I <i>think</i> it won&#x27;t stop anyone from reading.<p>Ignoring the bugs though...I&#x27;ve had my shared hostgator plan handle a couple of top page HN post with no additional caching installed, which makes me think it&#x27;s probably not a problem for most people running WP.

You don&#x27;t need anything to start it out, you just clone a standard git repo and watch the video (presumably completing the coding at the same time).<p>Each project has a desired functionality and would use a few key libraries so you can learn more about them. An example might be a instant messaging app using SocketIO, a basic dashboard using D3, a social network using Neo4j, etc.<p>The concept is to get people started with these technologies and then assist them in self-learning more about them after the project is finished (which they can continue to work on)<p>I&#x27;d release 1 project a week, on a Thu/Fri, in preparation for users to tackle it sometime on the weekend. The screencasts for a project would be in 2/3 parts and total >2hrs of content. You can purchase them for $10 each or sign up for a subscription for $30 a month.<p>Stack would vary, language will be mostly Javascript.<p>Would you guys pay for this kind of product?",1375415294

Similar to what <a href=""http://www.photoacute.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.photoacute.com/</a> does but they do more advanced superresolution stuff that your invisible noise might preclude, but a simple average or median in areas where there isn&#x27;t too much motion really improves the quality quite dramatically in some cases, particularily in low lighting situations. If your frame rate is that high it probably wouldn&#x27;t be hard to get a really good alignment between frames, so I thought I&#x27;d bring this up as a thought for a future feature (as in - you select the frame you like, then the program grabs a few frames immediately before and after and uses them to increase the image quality of the final output).",1375414116

At scale, you don&#x27;t have personal relationships with your customers, so you have to obey every letter of every law. Before then, though--when you&#x27;re small, and when you know each customer well-enough that you could call them <i>friends</i>--those customers have other ways to seek justice for things you do to them. Like, say, complaining to you.<p>This case is very similar to another I remember reading about on HN: an &quot;extremely exclusive restaurant&quot; in New York, which is not only invitation-only, but whose location is a well-protected secret. Why is it a secret? Because the &quot;location&quot; is an apartment! No restaurant license; just a &quot;retired&quot; five-star chef, cooking for you out of his own house. Completely illegal--all sorts of regulations are being broken--but much-beloved by all involved.<p>This is the kind of thing you can do when you have personal relationships with your customers. This is what you do that gets customers to love you--and can bootstrap into a big, legitimate business if you want. This is what people mean by &quot;hustling&quot;, but everyone is afraid to say. It&#x27;s going out on a real limb--not just sacrificing your own financial nest-egg, but giving your customers the ability to blackmail you or put you in jail if they decide they really don&#x27;t like you. But this is what makes magic happen.<p>(Note that I&#x27;m totally <i>not</i> advocating the <i>other</i> kind of &quot;hustling&quot;, the one done by grey-hat SEO &quot;growth hackers.&quot; If you&#x27;re a small, scrappy startup breaking laws that protect people from bad businesses <i>in their service, and to earn their gratitude</i>, then you&#x27;ll likely be okay; but if you&#x27;re breaking laws to &quot;achieve growth&quot; but earning people&#x27;s <i>spite</i> in the process (you know, those &quot;people who weren&#x27;t gonna be your customers anyway, so screw &#x27;em&quot;), then please don&#x27;t follow my advice.

Further interesting things with wp-cron is that since other plugins make use of it, if you do have a &quot;real&quot; cron implementation the advice is to use the real cron to trigger wp-cron (via curl hitting a localhost only accessible page). Again, it&#x27;s a kludge but it keeps things running.<p>On the topic of new stacks from the OS on up, Docker[1] (and lxc in general) and CoreOS[2] are really cool.

Due to the difficulty of quantifying latency and jank and the lack of existing benchmarks, no browser has really optimized for them, focusing instead on raw JavaScript throughput. My hope in developing this benchmark has been to change that.",1375412429

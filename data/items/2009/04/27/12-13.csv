I've tried to do this as much as possible in my own life, and I've found I'm much more effective when I don't do it <i>at all</i> (the most effective outsourcing is to try to articulate one's idea to someone else - but they don't need to actually do anything). This lack of gradual increase means there's no extrapolation to further increase, let alone an exponentially increasing acceleration into a singularity - not, at least, for <i>me</i> :-(.<p>Mechanizing conceptual understanding remains difficult.

We didn't 'evolve' to do anything but to further our genes. We didn't evolve to drive cars or use computers but here we are. Maybe we evolved to die early so there would be more food for our grandchildren. Evolution can be a rough guide but now we have science which favours a plant diet.<p>> There are people who already have issues getting enough iron and protein. This problem would only be exacerbated by a pure vegetarian diet.<p>People who are on the edge of starvation will benefit from any extra source of calories or nutrition. In the long term though the most efficient way to provide this would be via plants or perhaps even artificial means in some cases.<p>> Furthermore, we do not have an issue producing food for people.<p>Fair point. However the cheaper it is to produce food the more likely it will find it's way to the poorest of people.",1240834583

581221,comment,471660,471660,0,0,PeterWhittaker,,,"In the early '90s there was a trend to something called ""ego-less programming"". The idea was to leave your ego at the door when coding, and definitely when doing a code review, thereby removing personality - and personality insult or injury - from questions of code quality. As a then-techie  who'd attended a review or two, this struck me as a very good idea.<p>What you describe as ""identity"" may be better described as ""ego"". For most of us, the ego so dominates that the two are indistinguishable: Ego is who we are, ego promotes and defends our identity.<p>Now, without going all new age on you, think of a moment when your ego has been totallly in control (any episode of rage, be it road or code, is likely a good choice). Now think of how, on your better days, you don't consider that person to be you. Of course it wasn't, it was your ego taking control.<p>Keeping your identity small is one approach, but perhaps a more fulfilling one is to manage your ego. Recognize it as but one of your tools for personal expression and defense and bring it out only when necessary.<p>Many of us ""identify"" with a great many things and this makes life rich. Keeping your identity small may be impoverishing.<p>Consider discussions on religion or politics you've had with people who seem particularly wise or calm. They are probably among the best and most insightful discussions you've had. And I will bet that the wise person has strongly held beliefs, beliefs that are strongly part of their identity. But they manage their ego: They can consider all sides, and even update their position, because they have separated ego - and externally manifested phenomenom - from identity, an internal state.<p>(I experienced the ego-less programming trend at Bell-Northern Research, aka BNR, then the research arm of Northern Telecom, now Nortel. I don't know whether it was BNR-specific, Telecom-generic or industry wide. Interestingly, only techies and techie management really seemed to get it. Folks in soft disciplines thought having ego bound with code was necessary to take pride in one's work.)",1240833783

9875148,comment,9874388,9874679,0,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"Yeah, really.  I have <i>extremely</i> left-wing opinions, to the point that most Americans would indeed consider me a left-wing extremist.  <i>However</i>, these questions seem to me to fail to capture the interesting degrees of variation.  For example, there&#x27;s no option given for the right-wing position that poor people are not merely poor due to their own faults, but that in fact government policy should be used to appropriate what little they have and make them <i>even poorer</i>, or that foreigners should not merely be left outside the United States via restrictive immigration, but bombed into oblivion.  Neither is there an option for saying that we should not merely use taxation to redistribute wealth to the poor, but actually seize the means of production and abolish wage-labor.  The statement about Irish, Italian, and Jewish Americans fails to capture what really happened in the post-WW2 decades to integrate those minorities.  The questions on science versus religion contain no options for fundamentalist religion or transhumanism (despite the fact that Evangelical Christians make up 20% of the total population!).  The question about marriage doesn&#x27;t ask whether husbands should be able to beat or rape disobedient wives.  I can&#x27;t even answer the question about driving a car, because I don&#x27;t.<p>The interesting thing about studies of extremism lies in finding out exactly which views are considered the normative mainstream, and which views are considered &quot;out-of-sight&quot;.",1436738286

A unique subdomain for each web page load might be common, but from my reading of the article, it looks like every packet of the tunneled conversation gets a unique domain.

9875139,comment,9874460,9875106,0,0,Lazare,,,"First, a reminder:  Reddit is the <i>commercial product</i> of a <i>for profit company</i> which is currently losing a significant amount of money operating Reddit.  Last I heard they were being valued at $500m based on the expectation that they would be able to figure out how to profit from Reddit.  The people who run Reddit won&#x27;t just shrug and walk away if it turns out getting &quot;their&quot; slice of that $500m is harder than they expected.<p>> Reddit&#x27;s built a large community of people who don&#x27;t mind partying next to the biker bar.<p>Reddit has built a large community of people, large portions of whom absolutely detest each other and very much mind &quot;partying next to each other&quot;.  And as Reddit grows, the tensions are becoming more severe, not less.<p>> An anti-authoritarian community that wants free speech, is not politically correct, and isn&#x27;t advertiser friendly.<p>No.  A very, <i></i>VERY<i></i> small portion of the community could be described that way.  Most people just want celebrity AMAs, cat videos, dank memes, swapping funny stories, and maybe some chat about their local city or favourite sports team.  (Or relationship advice, or sex advice, or trading candy with people from other countries, or whatever it is that attracts them to Reddit.)  The number of people who are ideologically committed to free speech (and not just for the things they personally like) on Reddit is, as in real life, tiny.<p>(Edit:  If you disagree, feel free to cite a study or whatever.  But I&#x27;m active on reddit, moderate a moderately popular subreddit, etc., and I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re describing the Reddit community as it actually exists.  I&#x27;m not even sure that a Reddit community could even be said <i>to</i> exist.)<p>> It may not be an easy community to profit from, but does it need to be &quot;fixed&quot;?<p>See point one.  Absolutely, because Reddit will stop existing the moment Reddit Inc turns the lights off because it&#x27;s too hard to profit from.  (Yeah, sure, maybe they&#x27;ll hand the domain name off to a non-profit that can try and cover costs with donations first.  Assuming there&#x27;s anything left by that point, the resulting website won&#x27;t look much like the Reddit of today.)",1436738135

A mod from /AskHistorians:<p><a href=""https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3cxedn/i_am_steve_huffman_the_new_ceo_of_reddit_ama/ct07q5k?context=3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3cxedn/i_am_steve_huff...</a><p>>To illustrate, without in any way intending to boast, it is clear that a number of current and past staff members at Reddit really enjoy AskHistorians. This has been made publicly clear a number of times. But the reality of Reddit is that AskHistorians was created by going against the grain, by struggling against Reddit&#x27;s mechanisms rather than being organically created by them, and by quite frankly disregarding a number of statements about Reddit&#x27;s underlying philosophy made by admins and CEOs alike. That mostly involves deleting an enormous quantity of comments, with the express purpose that they are not seen any more, that they are vanished into the aether.<p>>In addition, reddit&#x27;s increasingly poor reputation on the internet might, for some people, be because of what they perceive as censorship. But in my experience, the majority of that poor reputation is garnered from the kind of communities that Reddit harbours, which have grown larger and increasingly restive. And so long as they&#x27;re there and doing their thing we have to share a website with them. We have to share a website with communities that have racist slurs in their name, that spew raw bigotry like it&#x27;s water for all the farms of China. A lot of our flaired users on AskHistorians are professionals in their fields, and at times it is pretty hard to keep convincing them to stay on a website like this. Most of that convincing consists of how much stuff we are able to keep out of our community.

At the same time, it&#x27;s not obvious that the kind of men that are happy to fully migrate their sexual needs to VR porn weren&#x27;t already out of the dating pool in the first place. They likely were already consuming regular porn as surrogate for their sexual lives.<p>On the other hand, I realize that women aren&#x27;t going to sit still, and they&#x27;re probably going to have to adapt to this new world, meaning they&#x27;ll possibly follow along and slowly dating might become mostly virtual.",1436735285

Places like /r/europe are usually pretty &quot;normal&quot; discussion boards considering that their demographics are English-speaking, internet-using young people of those regions. But periodically the comments (and comment scores) end up very uncharacteristic in a thread or sub-thread, especially if it has to do with immigration, Islam, or nationalism. Not just in the sense that some people have conservative or nativist views on those subjects, but that suddenly the discussion seems to be totally dominated by extreme versions of those views, anything vaguely liberal said about the subject is downvoted to infinity, etc. And the reason in that case if you dig around <i>usually</i> turns out to be that someone in a far-right/xenophobic subreddit linked there and caused an influx of people with those views.",1436735280

So, from a users perspective, the time you spent on that was well spent. Thanks for that! Ansible has saved me a ton of time spent on tedious and annoying tasks.<p>Personally, I think the balance between giving good user support and spending enough time on actual development work is really really hard to figure out. But one way projects could help it work better, is make sure it&#x27;s very clear how users should get support, and how much they can expect. And I have yet to see any project do that. If it was clear, then you could politely point newbies who just don&#x27;t know better at the support doc. People like me who spend a lot of time making sure our requests won&#x27;t waste time, would have solid guidance on how to do that. And jerks who are just wasting time could be politely pointed at the doc and then ignored when they don&#x27;t follow it.",1436734985

Otoh if the dealer feels that he has 2 or 3 people interested in the same car he will then be less likely to take a &quot;short&quot; deal from the 4th person who walks into the dealership. He will feel there is potential and it is worth the gamble to wait feeling he has a few plan b&#x27;s.<p>(Forget for a second whether this actually happens with car dealers I am only trying to illustrate the theory of what I call &quot;feeling fat&quot; which I have seen many times in business).<p>Of course as a group it&#x27;s hard to explain why all participants would act this way or that this even happens.

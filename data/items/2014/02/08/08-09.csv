7200714,comment,7200280,7200515,2,0,lutusp,,,"> I&#x27;m really surprised this didn&#x27;t come up more as the idea that &quot;science is attacking my religion&quot; tends to be one of the main reasons that people seemed to be adverse to science. It places a false dichotomy in choosing between their faith & science.<p>There&#x27;s a dichotomy between science and religion, but it&#x27;s not false by any means. In the most fundamental sense, and not to oversimplify, the scientific mind assumes ideas to be false until there is evidence to support them (scientists call this the &quot;null hypothesis&quot;), and the religious mind assumes an idea to be true until evidence proves it false -- exactly the opposite outlook.<p>Why is it a mistake to assume claims are true unless proven false? Easily explained — let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a True Believer who believes in Bigfoot. According to the True Believer&#x27;s way of picturing reality, Bigfoot exists unless someone can prove he doesn&#x27;t exist. But think about this — Bigfoot cannot possibly be proven not to exist somewhere in the universe, hiding under some rock. In formal logic, a disproof would require &quot;proof of a negative&quot;, an impossible evidentiary burden. Therefore a skeptical, scientific outlook is essential to avoid wasting time on childish fantasies. Need I add that religious people just don&#x27;t understand this?<p>Remember this when you see endless phony TV documentaries about Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster and ghost hunters. These shows are popular because most people don&#x27;t have the slightest idea how to process ideas. And only some of them have religious beliefs -- others are simply out in the ozone.<p>The above is the &quot;big secret&quot;, the divide that separates science and religion. And it&#x27;s not a puddle, it&#x27;s bigger than the Grand Canyon.",1391849365

The question is: what is science?<p>Apart from the fact that the debate gave the Creationists unearned attention and was therefore a mistake, no, trying to summarize science to these religious people would only have piled one mistake onto another. Consider the basics of science:<p>1. Skepticism toward everything, and the assumption that an idea without evidence is assumed to be false (the &quot;null hypothesis&quot;)  -- the opposite of a non-scientist&#x27;s attitude toward an unsupported idea.<p>2. The idea that any worthwhile idea must in principle be falsifiable by the right empirical evidence, or, to put this a different way, all ideas must pass muster by means of a reality-test. No reality-test, no validity.<p>3. The idea that all theories (ideas) are temporary and dispensable, that no scientific theories ever become true or beyond challenge by new evidence.<p>To simply describe this foundation of modern science would strike religious believers, people whose lives are ruled by blind belief and a severe lack of critical thinking, as monstrous. The scientific outlook cannot possibly be more opposed to the religious outlook, and to simply present it to a group of religious believers would bring down any house of believers.<p>What science actually consists of is on a long list of things that religious people don&#x27;t know about the modern world -- it&#x27;s too painful to contemplate. To try to break through this barrier would be a mistake. Better to do what Nye did -- show a fossil that&#x27;s obviously older than 6,000 years. Something small and manageable.<p>But again, I think the debate was a mistake -- it gave the creationists unearned attention.",1391847424

He claims his lawyers told him this was OK, but in fact legal opinion is divided on this: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Linking_and_derived_works"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Lin...</a><p>Of course, from his point of the view this really doesn&#x27;t matter: he is the copyright holder of both packages and he can hardly violate his own copyright.  The problem is for other people who might want to distribute modified copies of Capistrano under MIT but who can actually only do so under GPL.<p>If he really does want the whole package to distributed as MIT with no ambiguity then the solution is simple: change the license of SSHKit to LGPL.  If the company won&#x27;t agree to that, then change it to GPL plus written exception that we won&#x27;t sue you for linking to Capistrano.<p>However, he could be deliberately sneaky.  Tell people &quot;our lawyers think this is OK, but check with your own lawyers&quot;.

What they are trying to describe in that is the situation where someone takes a GPL piece of code, and writes a wrapper module (module B) that adds some kind of interface that their proprietary module (module C) knows how to interface with, and then they distribute this whole mess.<p>As far as I can see, Capistrano has not wrapped SSHKit or modified it. It just invokes SSHKit through its public interfaces. In particular, Capistrano does not seem to be a derivative work of SSHKit. If it and SSHKit are distributed together, this would be what the GPL calls mere aggregation.<p>Conceptually, it is no different than distributing bash along with a bash script that is not under GPL.",1391847186

But then you&#x27;re suddenly in the job of maintaining hairy scripts to push out config changes and ensure they are in sync.

That is merely quibbling over terminology.  The debate is (or should be) over the process one uses to arrive at the truth.  Empirically, if you use experiment as your arbiter of truth, you are led to make VASTLY more accurate predictions about the world, and hence obtain vastly more power to control the world, than any other criterion that man has yet managed to devise (and in particular, you do better than using any holy text as your arbiter of truth).<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if intelligent design is or is not science.  What matters is that when you put ID or YEC to experimental test, it fails.  When you put Darwinian evolution to experimental test, it succeeds.

7200649,comment,7200280,7200567,2,0,waps,,,"I do truly wonder. I mean do you guys give  absolutely zero consideration to the massive psychological difference in message ?<p>What does evolution say ?<p>Well, if one were to be really blunt, here&#x27;s the message : First of all, the natural laws generally referred to as &quot;conservation laws&quot;, mean that there is a finite carrying capacity of our planet. And even if we find more ... well this explains it far more eloquently than I ever could : <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umFnrvcS6AQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umFnrvcS6AQ</a> . Second, evolution can only work with a high growth rate and a high rate of natural selection. Natural selection means you and your family/friends/... die.<p>Translation : whatever level of comfort, safety and survivability you currently have, evolution means that outside of very short exceptional periods (like the one we&#x27;re in now : the oil/fossil fuel age, as it will be called when historians finally see the need for sane naming) it will go down. A large portion of humans will die without offspring, and if you allow for a few generations, most people (>90%) will not have any great grandchildren at all. The chances of you dieing without offspring, and without energy to keep you warm and without food to eat, are in reality over 30%. This is masked by currently being in an oil age, in a rich country. Evolution means that it will run out though.<p>The scientific view on this (which almost no-one accepts as true, especially the fact that evolution MUST stretch resources to the breaking point and the inevitable consequences of doing that) is accepted by almost nobody. I&#x27;m willing to bet you&#x27;ll see plenty of evidence of that in replies to this post. But, for example, if evolution is true, global warming is unstoppable until oil/coal run out or get replaced. That&#x27;s a trivial consequence of evolution, but nobody accepts it.<p>Oh and the correct reaction to global warming is to make it worse, as fast as possible. Any economics textbook about nash equilibria will tell you why, as will running computer simulations of actors surviving on limited resources.<p>Other things are that are beyond obvious make much more sense if viewed in the frame of evolution. Rationality, for example. Aside from the fact that it cannot exist (see your nearest philosophy of logic course, or read a course about the &quot;failure of the AI project&quot;), humans are not rational, they think along evolutionary lines. What does our mind do ? It looks for ideas, ways of doing things, what to do, how to behave. It changes the ones it finds a little bit, then executes them. If you look at the architecture of the human brain, I find it rather obvious that you do not have original thoughts. Some ideas&#x27; origins are really hard to trace, because they are a combination of what someone did in a tv show plus something you saw a squirrel do, and slightly modified, making it incredibly hard to see the connection between the &quot;new&quot; idea and the originals, but the same goes for genes. And yes, there are &quot;new&quot; ideas that you saw in a random pattern, but keeping in mind how fast human generations work, there would be no more than 1 of those per year for the entire human population, if that.<p>This of course means that no matter how convinced you are of the opposite, you are NOT thinking rationally.<p>There is plenty of proof that this is how it works. For example, kids that get raised by animals (it happens sometimes) do not walk on 2 legs (well except those raised by chimps and even then, I wouldn&#x27;t call their gaits 2 legged), despite obviously still having a body that&#x27;s built for walking on 2 legs.<p>There are fun experiments. Even the very signals we use to control our bodily functions are not actually generated by our brain. Our brain simply finds ways to process it&#x27;s inputs to generate the correct signal to send, e.g. to your legs to walk. So if you give your brain an overwhelming signal that&#x27;s explicitly designed to make processing it really hard then you can make the human brain sabotage it&#x27;s own body because it can&#x27;t reconfigure the external signal fast enough to make it useful. Result : human incapacitated (heart attack happens after ~2 minutes as was discovered by accident. Note that that figure is based on 2 accidental experiments and is probably not very accurate, but nobody&#x27;s about to do more testing) [3]<p>And then you have the other side :<p>Christianity : good news ! Jesus will save you (and we will help you make the best of it in the meantime). You live in misery anyway ? That&#x27;s God testing you. Invite more misery and help others and it will help you too[1].<p>Islam : that&#x27;s may or may not be true, but you can fight and take richess (and -slaves-) from dar-al-harb (everyone else), in fact that&#x27;s what those other guys&#x27; &quot;God&quot;, henceforth called allah, wants you to do to earn your salvation. Oh you live in misery despite fighting ? Well either you&#x27;re a traitor, or it&#x27;s the enemy&#x27;s fault.<p>Judaism : we have a contract with God, and as long as you follow these 613 rules to the letter, that will not happen. And don&#x27;t worry, they sound insane, sure, but you can read them a million different ways. It happened anyway ? Look, you violated interpretation 5 of rule 328, you deserve it !<p>Buddhism : you will live in misery, true, salvation lies in accepting it and making the worst of it.<p>Socialism : that is true, but if we all pull together and follow the little red book/this charter/hitler/... we can make life comfortable for everyone through research, working together, building everything up, ... [2]. Didn&#x27;t solve your misery problem ? Must be the bourgoisie/spies/traitors/... screwing it up ! Let&#x27;s kill them.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to be rude, but is anyone truly in doubt why atheism can never win ? Hell, I don&#x27;t want it to win. If I ever am in real trouble, then I&#x27;d like to find a group of Christians in my path if you don&#x27;t mind. Despite knowing more than 99.9% of hacker news about evolution and how the human mind works.<p>[1] I would argue that that last part is the essence of our modern states.<p>[2] I don&#x27;t mean to make it sound so ridiculous, but it worked for large parts of the world for quite a while in the sense that it improved their situation considerably for up to half a century, so please don&#x27;t think it can never work. This way of thinking got the first human to space, and collected pretty much the only information we have about the inner solar system.<p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_Incapacitator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_Incapacitator</a>",1391846419

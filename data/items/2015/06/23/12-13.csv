9764236,comment,9761470,9762800,0,0,lostcolony,,,"I will agree that Elixir has better tooling around building and releasing code.<p>However, in terms of barrier to entry for developing in, I actually think Erlang&#x27;s is lower. People tout Elixir for its syntax being similar to other languages, but that&#x27;s a detriment, not a benefit. Erlang and Elixir, both, require you thinking in a way most other languages don&#x27;t. With Elixir, and the language looking familiar, you&#x27;re tempted to try and shoehorn your existing knowledge, practices, etc, into an Elixir shaped package, and that leads to less idiomatic code, more surprises in how things actually work, and sometimes even more brittle applications than how they ~should~ be (though having a decent supervision tree means they&#x27;ll probably still be better than what you&#x27;d have had in those other languages). Using Erlang, though, you relearn from scratch. It&#x27;s a small language and that syntax isn&#x27;t really a huge barrier; being forced to code in a language that shares so little with what you&#x27;re experienced with means you&#x27;re likely open to new paradigms, and will pick them up instead of trying to reuse your existing ones.<p>At least, that was my experience with Erlang, compared with Scala/Akka (which I tried first, and ended up with a lot of OO, non-functional, non-parallel code).",1435063649

Her brother, Cherokee was an NBA player at the time and from my place in the pit, Corey Parks looked about seven feet tall. The combination of the very tall and imposing Corey Parks playing bass on one side, combined with Ruyter Sighs playing guitar on the other was very powerful. Nashville Pussy&#x27;s lead singer and drummer were both men, but Ruyter Sighs&#x27; flat out amazing guitar playing really drove the sound. Are they a girl band or a male band?<p>Or, what about Sonic Youth? Are they are a girl band or a male band? Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore decided they wanted to start making music, so they recruited Lee Ranaldo and eventually found a drummer. Kim Gordon was just as much a creative force as any of the men she played with and when she finally put her bass down, lo and behold, she was a damned good guitar player.<p>Or, how about Bikini Kill? Are they a girl band or a male band? They&#x27;re most heavily associated with riot grrl and are mostly considered Kathleen Hanna&#x27;s band, but Billy Karren was a straight up incredible guitar player. If there was any justice, he would be recognized as one of the truly great musicians to come out of that soon to be famous Washington scene.<p>Or, in a different genre, are the Cocteau Twins a girl band or a male band?

Back in 1742, Christian Goldbach (like Fermat, a mathematician-and-lawyer who made a famous long-unsolved conjecture in number theory) wrote in a letter to Euler that he thought every even number bigger than 2 could be written as a sum of two prime numbers. (E.g., 4=2+2; 6=3+3; 8=3+5; 10=3+7; 12=5+7.) Everyone believes this is true; there are good heuristic arguments why it &quot;should&quot; be true; but proving it is really hard. Like the abc conjecture, this is another one about the interplay between the additive and multiplicative structure of the integers. One method that&#x27;s been used to attack the Goldbach conjecture is the &quot;Hardy-Littlewood circle method&quot;, which is useful for a whole lot of other kinda-similar problems in number theory; it&#x27;s kinda-sorta an application of Fourier transforms to number theory. It was used back in the 1930s to prove the following statement, which is weaker in two ways: All <i>large enough</i> odd numbers are the sum of <i>three</i> prime numbers. (Note that if GC is true then so is this; if even=prime+prime then even+3=prime+prime+3.) What Helfgott has now done is to show that &quot;large enough&quot; means &quot;bigger than 5&quot; (which is the best that could possibly be done, since 5 is too small to be the sum of three primes). He did it by refining the &quot;circle method&quot;. Getting from here to the full Goldbach conjecture is still going to require major new ideas; there are somewhat-well-understood obstacles to using this method to prove GC itself.",1435062164

If you want less of something tax it. If you want more of something, subsidize it. under Obama, food stamps have quadrupled. Black unemployment is higher than it was under Bush and wage growth is non existent. Look at economic charts from 2002-2014 make note of what party was in control of Congress and thus the budget. Look at Clinton&#x27;s economic performance during the 1990; correlate that to the party controlling Congress. It&#x27;s fascinating.<p>Research Cheis Dodd&#x27;s role in Congredd during 2006-2008. See what Bush was warning about in terms of the housing market and what the Democrat response was when Bush warned about Fannie/Freddie instability. He was essentially laughed at by Chris Dodd and friends.<p>This instinctive anti-Reublicann sentiment is depressing because it seems like the Democrat marketing machine has done a good job obfuscating the issues. Whenever someone gets close to real scrutiny of the issues, they conveniently pull &#x27;racism&#x27; or &#x27;war on women&#x27; out of a hat. Meanwhile, I bet a majority of Americans can tell you the name of the Charleston shooter but have no idea what percentage they paid in Federal income tax or payroll taxes last year. Rand Paul released his tax proposal and more people seem to be concerned about a stupid flag. These supposedly &#x27;big&#x27; news stories aren&#x27;t that important. They&#x27;re distractions. Who gives a flying -- what race that white NAACP lady was? Who cares what comic book the Charleston shooter read when he was 15? Distractions. Give them bread and circuses..",1435061458

9764079,comment,9762285,9763768,0,0,gjm11,,,"So, four extra lines <i>for each item</i>? That would (much more than) double the length of the piece. Except that for several of them, much of that information is already there.<p>Still, let&#x27;s have a go.<p>10. <i>Mochizuki and the abc conjecture</i>. The abc conjecture says, roughly, that you rarely have a+b=c where a,b,c are all products of large powers of prime numbers. You can think of this as saying that the additive and multiplicative structures of the integers are kinda-independent. The abc conjecture, if true, would imply lots and lots of other conjectures that number theorists have made. (In particular, it &quot;almost implies&quot; Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.) Mochizuki claims to have proved it using a very complicated thing he&#x27;s created called &quot;inter-universal Teichmueller theory&quot;. Teichmueller theory is all about spaces whose structure is based on the complex numbers, which you can think of as being obtained as follows: start with the integers; allow yourself to form fractions (giving the rational numbers); &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; (forming the real numbers); &quot;add roots of algebraic equations&quot; (forming the complex numbers). But there are some not-so-obvious ways to &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; where instead of the usual limiting process where you do things with smaller and smaller errors (sqrt(41) ~= 6, 6.4, 6.40, 6.403, 6.4031, etc.) you try to do things that are right &quot;modulo large powers of p&quot; for some prime p; e.g., sqrt(41) = 1, 21, 821, 3821, 03821, 203821, etc.; but you should really think of this as exhibiting one thing mod powers of 2 and another mod powers of 5. Doing something comparable to Teichmueller theory using these gives you &quot;p-adic Teichmueller theory&quot;, and then &quot;inter-universal Teichmueller theory&quot; is a further generalization that I don&#x27;t understand. No one is quite sure whether Mochizuki&#x27;s proof is correct; it&#x27;s based on a huge amount of abstruse stuff he&#x27;s invented that no one was very interested in before he claimed to have used it to prove the abc conjecture, and getting one&#x27;s head around all that takes time. The next step is for the mathematical community (or at least some small bit of it) to understand IUTT well enough to check Mochizuki&#x27;s proof. I believe that&#x27;s happening, but it won&#x27;t be quick.<p>Hmm, that&#x27;s pretty long (despite not managing to do more than gesticulate vaguely in the direction of the relevant mathematics). I&#x27;ll do the others, but I think it&#x27;ll be one per comment rather than a single monstrously long comment.",1435061331
9764078,comment,9761851,9763687,0,0,pg314,,,">Anyone can learn to read, and write, computer code<p>I agree that most motivated learners could pick up some very basic software skills, and those would be beneficial to them. In a utopian world basic programming skills would be treated the same as basic literacy and numeracy. However, at this point in time, it seems to me that most users don&#x27;t care (maybe because they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re missing). As an analogy, most people could learn basic knife skills in a couple of hours and be much more productive in the kitchen with a chef&#x27;s knife than they are now with the huge array of inferior point tools (cheap dull knives, garlic slicer, chopper, egg slicer, etc.). However there is obviously a big market for the latter. Similarly, I&#x27;m not sure extensible and modifiable systems have enough attraction to the average user.<p>Another reason for closed systems, one which I think is more important than the profit motive, is that designing extensible and modifiable systems is really hard and comes with trade-offs. E.g. Squeak (a Smalltalk dialect) allows you to inspect and modify almost everything in the system while it runs, but that also means that is really easy to screw up the system behind repair (e.g. you can switch every boolean in the running system by evaluating &#x27;true become: false&#x27;) and that supporting users of such systems becomes much harder. I am not aware of any system that has a solution to this.",1435061330

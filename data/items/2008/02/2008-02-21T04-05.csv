120255,comment,119676,119676,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think there may be a limit to the amount of productive work you can get done in a day, and whether you hit that limit after 3 hours or 14 hours, it's still there.  So there may be some truth to your impression that news.YC isn't really hurting your real productivity.<p>OTOH, I've found that going out and getting some exercise, or turning off the computer and reading a book, or watching a movie tends to clear my head a lot quicker than social bookmarking sites or blogs.  I feel like I get ""stuck"" in a low level of activity when I read too much, like all that incoming information is still taking up cycles that would otherwise be used for my startup.  So maybe it's not the best procrastination activity. ;-)<p>I certainly have noticed that the biggest bottleneck for my productivity is the time it takes for my brain to adjust to and assimilate new architectural decisions.  And letting my brain relax and switch off seems to make that go faster.  (So does getting lots of sleep...again, sleep is not something to shortchange.)  I'm just not certain that news.YC or other programming-related websites really let my brain switch off all that well.",1203569741

Plus going out for a run mid-afternoon, weather permitting.<p>I've found that one of the largest benefits of working at home is that I can get up to pace whenever I feel like it without disturbing any cubemates.  I find pacing much better at clearing the head than deliberately going out for a walk, because I do it subconsciously without mentally unloading the problem.  I noticed the same effect at work too: when I had a big office to myself, or when my cubemates weren't in to work, I tended to get much more done.<p>I find I can't concentrate if I've been sitting at the computer for more than 2-3 hours straight.

I simply don't have/make the time to read them.  I personally think that the ACM digital library is a great thing to have access to, if your work and or leisure allows you time to read such things.<p>I keep thinking that someday I will have time to read all of these ACM publications I have accumulated.

About 8 years back, I worked at a funded startup that got tons of press, because we were all teenagers and it was the height of the dot-com boom.  We got a spike everytime we were mentioned, but it didn't stick, and we were actually <i>losing</i> regular users (they thought we'd gone all corporate, which I guess we had).<p>Build something worth talking about before you get people talking.

The point of Andrew Chen's article is indeed good -- viral growth, if you can achieve it, is awesome. But press is far from useless.<p>I have no idea what the product did at the last startup you worked at. A lot of times companies think pounding the press will bring them success, which is, again, not true (a shitty product that gets press won't go anywhere). However, a good product that receives press should settle down at more signups/day than before the coverage. Enough exposure, and a good product should eventually take off: people keep telling people about products they recommend, slowly, over time. You eventually build up a base of enough people that are recommending you that you really start to grow.<p>If it doesn't, I'd take a hard look at the product.",1203568785

120235,comment,120094,120097,0,0,mercurio,,,"Actually this is a joke thats quite 'hackable'. Let me illustrate:<p>You don't know what kerning is. You can make out that you are on a typography site so you have a basic idea of the kind of things it could be referring to. You notice that 'keming' and 'kerning' are visually really close, and that keming is defined as a wrong type of kerning. The only difference between the two words is 'rn' and 'm'. Thinking about what typographers would find interesting about this, you realize that sometimes if letters aren't separated properly, it would make it hard to read some words unambiguously. This could be an important enough issue for typographers that they might have a specific term for it. So maybe kerning describes the idea that letters should be properly spaced inside words, or maybe only the spacing of particularly troublesome letters, or even just the 'rn' combination. Either way you have a plausible idea what kerning means. Now you look at whether the joke makes sense with this idea. You see that it does, that keming would be both literally and visually wrong kerning, and the definition makes for a particularly clever pun. So everything fits together, and you can be reasonably confident that you get the joke and the broad meaning of kerning. You just reverse engineered the joke. Thats hacking.",1203568085
120234,comment,119919,119919,0,0,wallflower,,,"I tried a co-working site a couple times. It beats sitting in Starbucks or the local coffee shop (with free AC outlets and wi-fi) with a bunch of strangers - instead you are with your peers. And in a co-working space you don't feel like you have to subsidize your stay with strategically timed-out coffee purchases. Also, a nice thing is you can go out to lunch and leave your laptop there (it's secure). The 'can you watch my laptop' when you have to use the bathroom in a Starbucks-type environment (too much coffee subsidization) is always a little sketchy and feels imposing.<p>The weird thing about co-working is that it's like study hall - because other people are working - you feel the pressure to work as well - to not slack - or maybe not study hall but cram session before finals in a college library. So even though the music may be playing loud in the background, there isn't really a lot of networking going on - everyone's busy with their own gig. So you might actually get more interaction in an office setting - in my experience there's not a lot of small talk. Just queries like 'Dave - can you help me debug this [XHTML layout]?'<p>As a corporate worker bee programmer, I admire yet just got sorta jealous at the co-workers there who make a good living designing Wordpress/XHTML/Drupal (e.g. non-nitty gritty technical) sites for businesses.<p>Co-working is a powerful idea (like unionizing indie developers). I think it depends on the work style/personality of the individual. E.g. if you twitter multiple times daily, you're probably a good candidate.",1203568039

120226,comment,119760,119760,0,0,dusklight,,,"To me the most interesting part of the article was the paragraph that describes how some of the kids gave up:<p>""During the trading game, a couple of children simply gave up, while others waited passively for someone to give them valuable pieces. Drew said, ""I stopped trading because the same people were winning. I just gave up."" In the game, the children could experience what they'd not been able to acknowledge in Legotown: When people are shut out of participation in the power structure, they are disenfranchised — and angry, discouraged, and hurt.""<p>It reminds me of one of the most terrible sins that my mother inflicted on me when I was a child -- she taught me that things are supposed to be fair. She taught me the fairy tale that we have these things called ""inalienable rights"", such as freedom and justice and that kind of thing. She taught me that I was entitled to these ""rights"" and, implicitly, she taught me that I didn't have to do any work to earn these rights or to keep them.<p>She taught me, in very much the same way that the teachers taught these kids, that when there is injustice or inequity, I didn't have to do anything about it. All I had to do was whine about it and cry, and some higher power (like the teachers in this case) would come over and pat me on the head and fix it for me.<p>The truth is freedom and justice are not ""rights"". They are privileges, fought and earned by our ancestors, paid for by their tears and blood. We in the western world have grown so complacent in our corpulence that we just expect these things to be handed to us.<p>I would be much happier if, instead of making things fair for the ""disenfranchised"" kids, they had helped the kids see the advantages of their despair -- how having things stacked against them means that they have been given a chance to create a new way to win against greater odds, something the ""rich"" kids did not have and would never have.<p>The truth is the world does not owe us anything and we shouldn't expect otherwise. It is up to us to MAKE our place in the world, not sit and wait for it to be given to us.",1203567227

8682924,comment,8679471,8680239,0,0,john_b,,,"Nothing in the OP&#x27;s argument was quantitative. Both are qualitative arguments.<p>The OP raises some good points that deserve serious thought, but I find his argument sketchy and hand-wavy. The crux of the argument is this:<p>> <i>&quot;Our mainstream economic system is oriented towards maximal production and growth. This effectively means that participants are forced to maximize their portions of the cake in order to stay in the game. It is therefore necessary to insert useless and even harmful &quot;tumor material&quot; in one&#x27;s own economical portion in order to avoid losing one&#x27;s position. This produces an ever-growing global parasite fungus that manifests as things like black boxes, planned obsolescence and artificial creation of needs.&quot;</i><p>Everything else in the post is either analogy or following the assumptions in that paragraph to their conclusions. But the sheer amount of reasonable objections that are ignored or dismissed in that paragraph is staggering.<p>If today&#x27;s capitalist systems have systemic issues that result in gross misuse of resources, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for any of the reasons that the OP suggested. For that reason, I am skeptical of his proposed solutions.",1417460393
8682923,comment,8679471,8681841,0,0,EGreg,,,"That&#x27;s a straw man. It&#x27;s a good thing that there is specialization for tasks (automation is even more efficient) but with that comes other consequences. The organization always seeks to grow and expand, to create demand even if there isn&#x27;t any.  That is a consequence of the fact that the money it gets is more valuable to it than the services, since it can be spent on anything. Meaning it is more widely accepted so trading services for money is a net gain, and the more they do it the better for them. However on the collective level, this results in exploiting any externalities that they can including people&#x27;s attention, free time, the planet&#x27;s resources, polluting etc. The incentive is always to expand at the expense of the environment, until ecosystem collapse is threatened (see for example logging forests, etc. or yeast making beer). In short, the tragedy of the unmanaged commons.<p>Thanks for asking, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been able to tie it all in under one overarching picture so clearly before.",1417460380

Part of it is that it&#x27;s just so fast and easy to crank out something usable with minimal effort; I think this is largely because Meteor is unencumbered by any MVC requirements.

8682913,comment,8680076,8681925,0,0,emcrazyone,,,"Agreed.  I went to college in the US and got a EE degree and along the way almost switched to Applied Physics because of a really awesome professor I had and during which the physics I was taking was making use of the EE courses I went through.  I was introduced to Elctro-mag theory from a physics class that was again used in some of my EE classes.  I still remember physics experiments of passing current through two conductors each placed on balanced aparatus and watching the repel and attract due to current direction.<p>I had (still have) a knack for math and science but I&#x27;m just so amazed by guys like Maxwell.<p>The one thing that strikes me over and over is how insightful guys like Maxwell were.  At such a young age and time he was piecing together I guess what others living at the same time might call phenomenon.  Same for Einstein and Tesla.  I mean he literally devised the mathematical model that foretold what we would discover in the future.  And some 20 years later, Hans Christian Ørsted obtained the first evidence of a link between electricity and magnetism is quite amazing to me.<p>I recall reading an article some time ago about Tesla and how it was described that Tesla literally envisioned and saw AC current and then struggled to write it all down.  I write software and I can see a similar pattern in myself.  I often know and see, in my head, how something should work is so hard to explain.  Of course at a much more basic level than these guys.  It&#x27;s as if Maxwell just saw and imagine how things were connected.<p>I keep waiting for the link that adds gravity to the mix.<p>Very nice article.",1417460325

You can think of MarkLogic as a database built with search engine technology. It uses a document data model (text documents in XML or JSON). Each term (word, phrase, parent-child relationship, etc.) is indexed on ingest. There are index knobs and levers for things like diacritics, wildcards, and scalars, like you&#x27;d expect in real search engine.<p>As for document permissions, they&#x27;re indexed just like other terms. However, they’re automatically ANDed on to each query in the database engine, not application code. MarkLogic supports role-based permissions (read, write, and execute for stored procedures) with optional Kerberos and/or LDAP auth*n.“Ignored/hidden items” are those that a user doesn’t have permissions to access.<p>&quot;Followed/watched items&quot; is a pretty common requirement. MarkLogic uses a special &quot;reverse index&quot; to index queries along with text, values, and structures. With regular &quot;forward&quot; queries, queries find documents. With reverse queries, documents find queries. Thus anything that can be expressed in a query can be turned into an alert. This provides some pretty powerful match-making where a document can express its own attributes as well as those it’s interested in matching. Hook that up to a trigger (pre- or post-commit) and you have alerting that scales to billions of documents and millions of queries. One of the world’s biggest news sites uses this infrastructure on a MarkLogic cluster to handle saved searches and alerts.",1417460020

The main characters go through a wormhole and walk around on a planet where 1 hour = 7 years of Earth. Later, to help the mission succeed, the main character detaches from their main spaceship into a blackhole and he ends up in a multi-dimensional space where he sends Morse code messages to his daughter in the past by moving her books and watch. How does he do that? Because love. And gravity. She understands the message which contains gravity data from the blackhole that lets them get everyone off earth. The main character then pops out of the blackhole thing near Saturn and is re-united with his daughter just before she dies.",1417458451

Went to first doctor, was told &quot;it&#x27;s just bruised ribs&quot;, even though I don&#x27;t play any sports or do any serious workouts.<p>Went to a second doctor recently after a few months as it started getting worse. &quot;It&#x27;s just heartburn&quot;, even though I told him I already take a PPI, H2 blocker and calcium. I&#x27;ve had heartburn for 12 years and know this was a very different feeling, but he basically ignored me and proceeded to ask me about how often I went to church and about my sex life. I wish I was joking. So he wrote me a prescription for ranitidine (a weaker H2 blocker, sold as Zantac OTC.)<p>But thankfully the second time I was given a blood test and found that my vitamin D level was <9ng/ml, even though I was already taking vitamin supplements. So he wrote me a prescription for 150,000 IU of D2 weekly. That seemed to make it worse.<p>So I looked into this and found that D2 has poor bioavailability and depletes magnesium. So I obtained D3 and magnesium supplements, am taking a saner supplement level (10,000 IU daily), and have been feeling quite a bit better. Not perfect, but supposedly it can take three months to fully recover.<p>I was very surprised to learn that a lot of people develop random musculoskeletal pains in response to very low vitamin D levels. Neither doctor even considered that possibility.<p>I was very worried that this might have been something more serious, and it was basically impossible to convince either of two doctors to actually do some real tests just to be safe. When I read stories like this, I can&#x27;t help but wonder, what if it was the start of cancer (which killed my father)? And by the time the symptoms got bad enough to not write me off right away, it&#x27;d be too late to treat it?<p>I&#x27;ve had similarly terrible experiences with fatigue during the day due to my job&#x27;s oncall responsibilities. That doctor told me it was depression (I am absolutely not depressed), and tried to get me to start taking Zoloft, which I refused.<p>These GP doctors just don&#x27;t listen to their patients nor take their concerns seriously. I&#x27;m sure everyone always assumes the worst when something bad starts to happen, and likely it does turn out to be nothing. But one in three people <i>do</i> develop cancer in their lifetimes. How the hell are we supposed to get it diagnosed early when doctors just casually dismiss us out of hand?",1417458426

There&#x27;s no excuse for routinely writing bad code and &quot;premature optimisation is the root of all evil&quot; is all-too often used as an excuse for sloppiness.<p>However, I <i>possibly</i> disagree with the string formatting example. If it&#x27;s a function that gets called a lot and does a special-case string conversion like this, fine go ahead and optimise it. But that&#x27;s a <i>real</i> optimisation, not what the author has termed a micro-optimisation, which I take to be something you should just do routinely (like ++i instead of i++ in C++).<p>If you have lots of string conversions throughout your code then the chances are most of them are going to be sprintfs or whatever is the most flexible tool in the language you are using. In these cases, you should just stick with what is idiomatic within the context of that project. It makes <i>reading</i> the code later a lot faster when everything is similar. It also tends to make it easier to change when your simple special cases need to become more complicated.<p>For example, I have in previous projects standardised on regular expressions for almost all string comparisons, even in situations where a simple substring compare would be much more efficient. However, since 90% of the codebase is using regular expressions to do complex comparisons, it just makes life easier if they are used everywhere unless there&#x27;s a really, really good reason to do things differently. It reduces cognitive load when reading the code if it follows a similar style throughout.<p>It also makes maintenance easier when you use the most flexible tool at your disposal everywhere instead of special-casing. Let&#x27;s say you expect the first character of your string to be an &quot;a&quot; and you do it with substr(foo,1)==&quot;a&quot;. Later, you need to make it case-insensitive because of a bug. With regex you just add an &quot;i&quot; flag, but with the special case, you need a tolowercase call. No biggie, but the next day you need to support unicode accents. Uh oh...<p>If you have a large codebase where string processing is all done in the same way, when you get a bug like not recognising &quot;á&quot; as &quot;a&quot; then at least you will find that all parts of your system behave consistently. Fixing the problem should require roughly the same fix everywhere. The test cases can all be the same. Going back to the author&#x27;s example, there&#x27;s no guarantee that sprintf(&quot;%d&quot;,x) and itoa(x) will produce the same output on all platforms, so it&#x27;s possible this change although it should be functionally identical, might in reality introduce new edge-cases that you need to test for.<p>If you&#x27;ve got special cases everywhere then you&#x27;re going to get different sorts of bugs in different parts of your system which can lead to issues being much harder to trace, harder to test and harder to fix.<p>TL;DR: Optimise for readability first. Then optimise for performance. Allocate the time you have wisely. Homogeneity is reasonable substitute for DRY; special-cases for common patterns are usually bad and can introduce bugs.",1417458314

Google indicates a median radiologist gets $300K/yr and to make the figures ridiculous I&#x27;ll dedicate one radiologist full time to the MRI.  Google indicates mean lifetime of a MRI machine is a decade.  Google indicates a hospital remodel to make a MRI safe room and electrical and cooling and ventilation might exceed the cost of the machine maybe $4M.  Google indicates budgeting 3 hours per patient is not totally unreasonable.  There is maint downtime and testing and the radiologist probably wants to sleep occasionally, even if there are actual specific scans that only take 15 minutes.<p>So the total cost over the decade lifetime of a MRI machine<p>3e6 + 4e6 + 300e3 * 10 + 100e3 * 10<p>You don&#x27;t need a calculator to add that up to a cool eleven million bucks for ten years of MRIs.  However you divide that out and thats only three grand per day over that decade.  Or if you assume a long term average of 3 hours per scan (a bit on the high side) thats $375 total cost per scan.<p>Google reports the average billing is somewhat under two grand, but my math shows about four hundred bucks.  Even assuming only 50% utilization they can still only account for $800 per scan.<p>I&#x27;m thinking that despite the mantra / astroturf that MRI is really expensive to provide, its actually a huge profit center for a hospital.  Not as bad as the proverbial $35 aspirin pill, but pretty profitable none the less.<p>Another way to run the numbers is if the fixed cost of having the machine and radiologist available is about $3K/day, and they get about $2K/scan in revenue, you may have been part of a long MRI train that day, but the average machine actually only scans 3 people every 2 days on long term average.<p>Sounds like a market that&#x27;s either ready for disruption, or so well protected by regulation that it can&#x27;t be disrupted.",1417457835

Also, red goes much better with black then the blue/purple background you&#x27;re using.<p>2 - Spacing - give your text a little more room to breathe.

Most times, you&#x27;re lucky if an app has targeted more than just one platform. And try running modern native apps on the 1st gen iPad; developers leave old tech in the dust regardless of which platform their targeting.<p>I will agree that web apps need to get better in general and work within the constraints of the browser, and that news sites should have as little complicated javascript as possible (or at least sensible fallbacks), but that&#x27;s not a reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater. For a wide swath of applications, the web is the only truly ubiquitous deployment target and when done right (Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, Hacker News, etc) web apps can reach a much larger user base for same development time than native apps can.",1417457272

I&#x27;m aware that the Mozilla review process is slow, but this rant is not the one that&#x27;s going to fire up people in Mozilla to fix it.<p>The author cries, &quot;...as an open source project, we’re already stretched thin—it’s a colossal waste of resources to deal with the issues caused by this policy. If we were a for-profit company, we could just make it someone’s job.&quot;<p>What does the author think Firefox and Mozilla are? Firefox is open source and Mozilla is a non-profit. That Mozilla as a non-profit has policies to have volunteers do what seems like a good job (especially looking at the AMO review comments in this case) should be lauded. As IvyMike pointed out trusted extensions morphing into malware in Chrome, which is developed by a hugely for-profit company, it seems to me that Google is the one that should be considered hostile to everyone in the community and should also be ashamed.<p>Also, the author does not need to stoop so low saying things like &quot;I can not in good conscience recommend that Ember developers use the Ember Inspector add-on from the Mozilla add-ons page. Either compile it from source yourself and set a reminder every few weeks to update it, or switch to Chrome until this issue is resolved.&quot; For heaven&#x27;s sake, host the extension on your site and provide the link to the XPI file to your users. Firefox can install it from there and your users will click on the &quot;allow site to install extension&quot; dialog. There is no need to host your extension on AMO if you&#x27;re this upset with Mozilla.",1417456983

In many XML parser implementations, node order is reflected in the resulting DOM. Yes, a schema lets you demand that nodes come in a specific order, and this is a complete non-problem, generally -- the whole point of schemas is that they very tightly define the format, and source systems abide by it, even if that means they have to alter the generating order to be compliant.",1417456958

Digital files are the clear overall winner in terms of convenience, portability, and flexibility but even leaving aside any audiophile debates over sample rate and analog vs digital, there&#x27;s something a lot of people enjoy about tangible items, big cover art, and the feeling that paying (or paying more) is justified when you get a physical <i>thing</i> as opposed to a bunch of bits.  Bundling lets you have it both ways and since the cost of distributing the digital version is very low, it&#x27;s not much of an added cost (even if either way you&#x27;re primarily paying for the cost and value of the actual data whether you buy vinyl, CD, or mp3).",1417456896

Some things we&#x27;re working on:<p>* Data capture. We’re integrating with more clients and frameworks, including Android, AngularJS, and Backbone.js, all with virtually no performance overhead or integration cost.<p>* Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice the data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies and reflect up-to-the-minute data.<p>* Data visualization. Simple pre-generated graphs just don&#x27;t cut it. There&#x27;s an enormous number of ways to organize the data. Existing tools only scratch the surface.<p>Heap was in Y Combinator’s W13 batch.

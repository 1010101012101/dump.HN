It starts with fakery, as the email can&#x27;t be plain that it is the start of a standard recruitment process, but says &quot;...to tell you more about what we&#x27;re up to&quot; in a mock-casual way. But of course they&#x27;d never tell you something that isn&#x27;t ready for public announcement because at that stage no you do not have a special relationship with the company and might even have a stronger relationship with a competitor.<p>Every company making cold calls to candidates pulls these sorts of tricks. If you want to make yourself stand out enormously, and seem incredibly different from every other company approaching candidates over email, LinkedIn, StackOverflow, etc, then something you could do is look into the candidate&#x27;s public material enough that you can <i>start</i> by telling them the offer you want to make ($xxx,xxx), assuming there is a cultural fit.<p>For a lot of engineers there is a bucket load of the stuff out there. Tech talks on YouTube, even from the smallest local meetups these days. More code on github than you could get them to do in a thousand technical interviews. If they did a PhD, or even an honours dissertations, it is probably on the web and will tell you in great detail what they&#x27;re interested in and how they went about solving a tough problem.<p>If your email started with the fact that you&#x27;re interested in hiring them, here&#x27;s the things you&#x27;ve already looked through, and so this is the offer you&#x27;d like to make if there&#x27;s a cultural fit, that will make a candidate feel like you really have done your homework.",1428278382
9325762,comment,9325501,9325501,0,0,tomasien,,,"I used Angular for the first time recently building a little example demo based off a template that used Angular. It was so horrible to use in basically every way, however some of the concepts (as noted in this article) intrigued me. I would never use it again, but I do data-bindings are conceptually correct, in that the DOM should have dynamic properties. Right now you do that in jQuery or common JS by adding a class or ID and then binding manipulations to that class/id or element, but that&#x27;s obviously a hack.<p>The problem is Angular is ALSO obviously a hack and makes a lot of things harder than they need to be.

I was investing in Angular 1.0 until this happen.<p>While working professionally, my team lead chosen Ember.JS.<p>Anyway, in general Angular have a very different way to do thing and you basically create html element and the js will defined the html behavior.<p>In general, I think the announcement of Angular 2 have slowed down the momentum of 1.0 very much. Angular 2 from what people have been saying is totally completely different from 1 and it could be name something else and noone could tell it&#x27;s an angular framework from 1.<p>With all the js front end framework out there, I think it&#x27;s too wild west and I rather let this area mature much more before choosing one.

9325697,comment,9325501,9325598,0,0,Bahamut,,,"Overall, I like what Angular v1 does and how easy it is to be productive in it - I have helped save multiple companies&#x27; products (medium-sized codebases) because Angular can be extremely quick to iterate on top of and gives you so many tools for that productivity, while unit testing much of it (although the unit testing situation is not quite perfect).<p>I like using Angular relative to Backbone and Ember, although my experience with Ember was last a year ago, and the framework has progressed a lot since then. I like React over Angular 1 currently, especially since it supports robust server-side rendering solutions. React takes some ideas from Angular such as not being opinionated with the models, but makes writing the core of its components much nicer than Angular 1&#x27;s directives. It also does not take much opinions over the service architecture, which also makes me happy, but the tradeoff is that it leaves a lot of developers in the dark as far as how to organize code with it - that is why Facebook pushed the Flux pattern very strongly.<p>Angular 2 definitely took a lot of React&#x27;s good points and integrated them in better ways into Angular 2, or have plans to integrate them. Ideas such as supporting immutable data, virtual DOM (well, at least something similar to virtual DOM anyhow), and unidirectional data flow make their way into Angular 2. Robust dependency injection (no more using $inject or the hacky array syntax for DI) and better API for creating components come as more evolutionary changes from Angular 1. The declarative templates are also a lot simpler, as expression support is more limited than the broad JavaScript-like syntax supported in Angular 1. Shadow DOM being a first class citizen of the framework makes having to worry about component CSS being clobbered a problem of yesterday.<p>Overall, I am excited as a frontend developer - there are a lot of exciting things happening in the frontend world, and the ecosystem is maturing by leaps and bounds.",1428276779

I&#x27;m also looking forward to using Ionic 2, I know you guys have been hard at work on it and I believe Drifty will come up with something far more awesome than Ionic 1 with the better API & design available in Angular 2.<p>I disagree with many of this article&#x27;s points. I was once a junior developer, and what Angular did was bring a lot of better practices to my code and exposed me to a lot of things that I would not likely to have been exposed to in such an easy manner, such as unit testing, easy to grasp high level structures. From what I have seen, it also has introduced a lot of better practices to a lot of companies, whose developers previously wrote awful code that was hard to reason about - Angular 1 does not cure this completely, but it helps give a foundation that does ease life some when working with flawed architecture, since it discourages even worse stuff strongly by design and by communication.<p>Angular 2 is already shaping up to be absolutely awesome so far, excepting how it handles dynamic components currently, but I believe this will be fixed before it reaches beta status - it is moving extremely fast currently. It feels very similar to using React, except with more standards-based tooling & browser technology support (Web Components, ES6 usage built into its design, etc.), no JSX, and less clunkiness (the getters/setters for component states in React get clunky quickly, as well as the various other checks).",1428275936

Symbols like / | or \ can act as substitute for bracket like syntax.<p><pre><code>    > If we look at languages which did away with \n      this made-up difference we see that pretty much no  \n      person is missing  it.\n</code></pre>\nEh, not sure what languages are these and how you think they relate to Rust. Keep in mind Rust goal almost from the start was something that is familiar to a people that worked with Gecko engine. With that in mind, I can&#x27;t think of a similar family language that did this.<p>You know what happens when you call Index/IndexMut. To say it isn&#x27;t so, is outright fallacious.<p>Also Rust takes the probably best road of allowing limited operator overload, which IMO so far proved better than allowing no operator overload or allowing custom operator overload - which is subject to weird rules and/or leads to heavily overloaded code.<p>Also [] always does same thing. For given Index value it returns value found at that index. & is not an address. AFAIK address are never allowed unless you drop into unsafe. It&#x27;s a borrow reference to Output value. Index returns immutable version, while IndexMut takes mutable version and returns mutable output value.<p>2) No we don&#x27;t. I think having user and built-in defined types is perfectly ok. In any non-Lispy langugage there are special literals, which can&#x27;t be handled by user defined ways, unless you allow for some funky grammar.<p>4) Related yes, same no. In same way i32 and u32 are related but not the same. As I said in previous question having some subset of language be unable to modify is IMHO a good thing.<p>6/7) They can&#x27;t. You can tell by mutability of array which one will be called and which one will be returned. You CAN&#x27;T EVER change type of mutability of result.<p>9) Whenever I see macros/operator overload/syntax being given too much freedom, it always ends up with incomprehensible DSL-s that you can&#x27;t disentangle from regular code.<p>10) Subjective opinion. And it could be trivially solved with better type aliases.<p>12) I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big problem and a fix to Cargo that adds a special unique identifier should be trivial to implement, although not necessarily forward/backward compatible.",1428275464

If the backend has a clean RESTful API, then Angular is not so painful. If the backend has a complicated structure, then I find myself wasting epic amounts of time trying to find templates, paths, etc.<p>Angular will make a lot of calls to the backend, but in general you can not look at your Angular code and figure out where all the calls are going to the backend. Complex URLs are often assembled from diverse variables that are stored in varied locations. You can not grep for an URL because it does not exist as a string. There is no equivalent to the &quot;rake routes&quot; command -- no way to find out what routes Angular might use. I found myself opening the dev console on FireFox and watching what Ajax commands were issued while the pages loaded and operated -- which is a fine way to track down a call that is working, but if a call isn&#x27;t working, then it won&#x27;t show up in the dev console, and you are left trying to track it down.<p>There might be some structure or conventions that would allow us to find the problem when facing a bug in our Angular code, but so far we have not found it.",1428275247

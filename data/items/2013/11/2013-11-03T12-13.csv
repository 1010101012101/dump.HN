I recall he was computing a dot product or something that was used over an 8 pixel span.  The hack was that he started an fpu divide and then got useful work done on the integer pipeline without a stall, perfectly timing out when the fpu would have his value ready.  What a brilliant hack.  I recall the satisfaction of knowing so much secret knowledge.  :)",1383483586

6663046,comment,6662847,6662847,8,0,mlchild,,,"I am, to some degree, running the concluding thought experiment in real lifeI dropped out of business school to try to build my own company. (Left after one year, at least partial credit?)<p>Some thoughts:<p>I can&#x27;t speak to how widespread the entitled-MBAs-in-startup-roles (no direct experience) problem is, but MBAs definitely have good job prospects (in the traditional sense), which has made it much harder for me to convince former classmates to &quot;take the leap&quot; and try to start companies instead.<p>At least on the West Coast, the startup classes treat leanness as a central principle. I didn&#x27;t meet many MBAs (especially ones who took those classes) who believed strategy could be laid out and then executed by underlings. Your mileage may vary.<p>I went to business school because I wanted to get out of the consulting job I didn&#x27;t like, and loved technology and wanted to move to the Bay Area. That said, it didn&#x27;t sit well with me that I didn&#x27;t pursue my dream and try to start a company instead of going, which made me unhappy all year. The question of what motivated someone to go to b-school is generally a good one, though, as most MBAs will gleefully admit that their goal was to spend two years kicking back at &quot;summer camp for adults.&quot;<p>The limits to the degree&#x27;s usefulness, in my opinion, come from the fact that much of the good learning is in the hard-won experience of visiting founders and leaders (a la Startup School speakers). Unfortunately, to quote Clayton Christensen: Questions are places in your mind where answers fit. If you havent asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go...You have to ask the question  you have to want to know  in order to open up the space for the answer to fit.[1] I often felt like visiting speakers were giving good advice, but that I didn&#x27;t have the place in my mind for the answer to fit yet. Another reason to try to start something and accumulate better questions.<p>The opportunity cost was the strongest motivator for me. As a twenty-something tech nerd, another year felt like an eternity. And I&#x27;m already five months better at programming and building a product than I would have been. Which feels like a win vs. another piece of paper.<p>I deeply believe my cofounder and I have a better chance of success because we took this path instead (he quit his job). I guess we&#x27;ll be one more piece of data for the experiment in a few years.<p>P.S.

Even within the security and cryptography research communities it is rarely used.<p>The solution to this particular problem is to have smartcards; while we are at it, we should also use smartcards for authentication, so that when you sit down at your friend&#x27;s computer you plug in a smartcard to log in <i>and</i> to read your messages.

6663012,comment,6662847,6662847,46,0,Zak,,,"First off, I&#x27;d like to get a few straw-man argumetns out of the way. I&#x27;m not saying MBAs are bad. I&#x27;m not saying startups should not hire people with MBAs. I&#x27;m not saying there are not numerous counter-examples to the points I make below. In fact, I personally know several people with MBAs that work at or have founded fantastic startups. I have hired & worked closely with individuals with an MBA several times, and will continue to do so if I think the individual is a good fit. Remember, a hiring signal is just that: a signal. Other examples of negative hiring signals are: earned CS degree from school that advertises on late-night television, worked at 4 companies in 3 years or 2 year gap on the resume with no explanation. Any positive or negative hiring signal is WAY less important than specific information about a specific candidate.<p>Now that that is out of the way, lets get to the point: If a person has a particular skill-set, experience, personality & undergraduate education, that person choosing to buy an MBA has the net effect of the startup market valuing that person as being worth less, not more.<p>Why?<p><i>Supply and Demand</i><p>There are some basic supply and demand issues for MBAs. On the supply side, there is a surprising abundance of people with MBAs who want to work at startups. On the demand side, a candidate with those three little letters on their laptop will need to be vetted more closely and will be automatically isolated into a small number of highly-specialized potential roles.<p><i>Entitlement</i><p>Apple trains people to think of themselves as special snowflakes, future masters of business, worthy of extremely high compensation and authority. Thus one primary motivation of an MBA owner is to secure their own massive salary, stock and title and this motivation is diametrically opposed to the psychological makeup of a successful startup team-member. Given the social pressure MBA owners must feel from their coffee shop friends, we cant really blame them; its human nature 101.<p><i>Misguided Thinking</i><p>In my opinion, the lean startup movement, startup genome project, etc have roared into existence as an antidote to &quot;MBA thinking.&quot; &quot;MBA thinking&quot; involves putting all of the value in high level design, which is then rolled out to underlings who are responsible for actual implementation. In other words to an MBA owner Design > Implementation.<p>Lean startup philosophy suggests all of this design stuff is misguided bullshit, and rather you should personally build things as quickly and as cheaply as possible then scientifically iterate over and over again. To an early stage startup Implementation > Design.<p><i>Selection Bias</i><p>It really bears examining a persons motivation for getting an MBA. Was it so they could skip ahead to get rich? Because they wanted to be powerful? Because they hated their job and showing off in coffee shops was a good way out? Because they originally wanted to work at 37 Signals but are only now considering your startup because they heard that your&#x27;re building the successor to Ruby on Rails?<p><i>Limited usefulness</i><p>If someone is on a startup career track that is in design or high-level architecture, an MBA makes a lot of sense. For instance, a smart startup founder might want their lead designer to have an MBA. But how many startups ever get big enough to need a lead designer? How many high-level design gigs are actually out there? This is a very shallow pool to swim in.<p><i>Opportunity cost</i><p>The time someone spent getting an MBA was time they could have spent installing Linux on a Thinkpad. Losing two inches of screen real estate puts you at a clear disadvantage vs someone with the same CPU who can actually see a decent amount of code at once.<p><i>A thought experiment</i><p>Imagine that if instead of getting an MBA, ambitious young over-achievers spend two days upgrading and configuring their hardware and software. Or two days building a desktop. Or two days shopping around to see what else they could get for the same price.<p>Who would be worth more in the open market when all is said and done? Who would have a better chance of building their own great company?",1383482916

I emailed 6 contributors (5 of whom had never heard of me) and just asked clearly and politely for permission to reprint their articles. I gave them the option to say yes or no. I used a similar flow for each but they were personal and focused on the reader.<p>2. I emailed the local Mac dealer to offer some webdev services (email marketing and SEO). Just as a test, really to validate cold email as a customer acquisition tactic. Again, it was all about the recipient. The polar opposite of the generic emails I get from Indian agencies every week.<p>There&#x27;s a great I Love Marketing podcast that talks about a play they call &quot;the cats whiskers&quot;. It&#x27;s worth a listen if you plan to do cold emails. It&#x27;s episode 24.<p>Actually, I just thought of a third -<p>My girlfriend is an artist and had gifted a painting to some friends for their wedding. They hung it prominently in their restaurant and had a few enquiries about it from their customers. They collected a few email addresses.<p>About a year later, my girlfriend decided to do a limited edition print run and sent 9 emails (just as a test really, to see if there&#x27;d be any takers).<p>Basically said &quot;You saw my painting in Ord Ban. I&#x27;m doing a ltd edn print run. Send 100 to my paypal email if you&#x27;d like one&quot;. Next morning there was 700 in paypal which covered printing/shipping and a profit margin. Not 100% cold because the recipients had expressed an interest but there&#x27;d been no prior contact at all.",1383480940

Yes, hiring signals exist, but all signals are not equal. Placing too much negative value on a person achieving a Masters degree can easily turn out to be a mistake.<p>I also don&#x27;t buy the opportunity cost argument. Does the author examine every line of every resume to determine what the applicant <i>could</i> have been doing instead and gives the best score to the applicant who left the least on the ground? Or is this pedantic behavior executed exclusively on MBAs, because they deserve the stereotype?<p>I question the value of yet another article like this. It&#x27;s just amplifying the noise in the echo chamber. The author states he knows several MBAs who have worked at or founded successful startups. Why not write about that instead of rehashing the same, dull, unsupported claims?",1383480858

It worked quite well when the formatting was in the HTML instead of CSS. It was essentially a GUI word processor with an HTML file format.

I don&#x27;t know what businesses you&#x27;ve been in but I find that if you think your &quot;business aim&quot; is something that it &quot;might&quot; help to &quot;hang off of something else the callee might find desirable&quot; - then your approach is really tough.<p>Businesses exist because customers love paying them.  There are few to no business aims that you could possibly fulfill without being inherently interesting to the people you&#x27;re writing or being in touch with.<p>If you don&#x27;t have an offering that is interesting, it&#x27;s not that you should hang your offer on something that is of interest - it&#x27;s that you need to fix your product/market fit!<p>That said, there are appropriate and inappropriate venues.  As shown by my shopping habits, I love buying groceries, or paying for utilities - but that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;d like to see emails about either.<p>So I can see that you might have to overcome the limits of your channel.  Overall, however, you should be able to find channels where your business aims align easily with what customers want.",1383480432

So for people with unlocked bootloaders, this isn&#x27;t a problem; and if a handset doesn&#x27;t allow the bootloader to be unlocked, refuse to buy it!   There are plenty of perfectly good (and in my opinion, superior) choices out there which allow for the bootloader to be unlocked.   All of the Nexus devices, for example....<p>There is another advantage of using a locked down file system --- you may not be able to use a rootkit to break root and then modify the file system, but some unfriendly adversary, such as the FBI or the NSA, won&#x27;t be able to do it to your phone without your knowledge, either.   I would think that&#x27;s worth the inconvenience of making sure you buy a phone with an unlockable bootloader.   (Since unlocking the phone requires a wipe of the disk, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the FBI/NSA doing this to access your data on the phone without your knowledge.)",1383480113

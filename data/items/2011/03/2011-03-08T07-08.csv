I think the fact that he has never had a real job - one where he could easily be fired for messing up, has a lot to do with this.<p>You learn very quickly when you or someone else gets hell rained down upon them from a boss who decides they did or said something inappropriate - no matter what the context or meaning was.  I know I've seen people get fired, or come close to it, for saying something that I never before would have given a second thought to, but I definitely did after that.<p>So when it comes down to it, there is no way I'm going to risk my professional career by letting my Facebook identity be my public persona.  Hell, I even have a rule against having family members friend me on Facebook.<p>It's not about being a different person in each setting, it's about being able to act appropriately in each setting.  --Being someone who is viewed as a dependable, professional expert at work, being able to have a serious discussion with my father about my mother's Alzheimer's at home, or being able to relax and let out my inner child a bit with friends.

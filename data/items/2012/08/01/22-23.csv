Here the catch: I am at best an average programmer so I need something really easy to use.  My program will not be too complicated: I would just use listviews, buttons, text fields, etc.  Is creating the GUI widgets via an XML file (along with the layout) a good way to go these days?  It seems like this would be easier to develop and maintain.<p>Right now, I have a good command-line version of my program and want to add a GUI to it.  I'd also love to ""compile"" the Python code and then be able to distribute it a .exe installer or a .dmg image.<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!",1343861850

4326225,comment,4320585,4321754,2,0,wutbrodo,,,"There are so many ways to describe how wrongheaded this is that I don't even know where to start.\nThe idea that less efficient transportation is beneficial because it would require people to be more active is absolutely insane.  By that logic, we'd be better off with no transportation other than walking; I find it hard to believe that everyone would be better off if they were constrained to working somewhere within a few miles of them (or alternatively, required to spend half their day just getting to work). Rooting for a higher level of car accidents, pollution (the number of cars needed could easily be cut by as much as half), and congestion in order to force people to walk is ridiculous.  Throw in the fact that sedentary lifestyles/obesity are pretty strongly correlated with lower income and education level (ignorance of health/nutrition issues, lack of time due to heavy work schedules, there are different reason for different people in this situation), and the economic benefits alone of a significantly more efficient transportation system  would likely cancel out whatever possible increase in sedentary living it may cause.<p>Driverless vehicles have the potential to transform transportation, full stop. This obviously includes public transit (I highly doubt that a driverless bus is much of a technological leap from driverless cars).  Whatever benefits public transit provides are included in the changes that driverless vehicles will bring (unless, as it seems, your only in support of inefficient public transit?).",1343861782

Obviously it's probably not a good ideal to publicly signal to your cable company partners that you have any sort of plan that doesn't involve relying on them in the future.<p>You know Apple saw the future of tablets because they were working on them for 5-8 years but until the day the iPad launched all you ever heard from Apple/Jobs was he couldn't figure out why anyone would ever want one and they were only good when you're on the toilet.<p>This may be wildly misguided but I have some faith that the people running HBO aren't idiots.  HBO Go itself was way ahead of other channels in bringing their content on demand to customers with digital lifestyles.  Yes there's a few major bridges they haven't crossed but that seems to currently be working in their favor.  I think they're aware of where those bridges are and as producer of great content they are well positioned to cross them when the time comes.<p>I also have some confidence that people like Eddie Cue are making the case for the end run around the cable companies to HBO and other content producers behind closed doors.

But since I was talking about subviews I didn't want to go into the non-subview render bits which would be where you'd want render helpers.<p>Regardless, I'd still have the single `render` as a parent method that renders the initial template via `$.html()` so that my render helpers aren't appending their bits into the DOM. And that parent method still shouldn't break everything if it's called twice.<p>And then if you wanted to be safe, you could have the render helpers check to see if the view is `rendered` before attempting to do their bit.

If they are having issues with customers jumping ship, I would imagine that it would happen even faster if they dropped the HBO option from their line-up as retribution for HBO pushing their own streaming video offering (or teaming up with Netflix/Hulu/etc).

However, I've built a few real-time delivery businesses, and I'm pessimistic.<p>Real-time operations are costly to manage even though the software has become easier to build.  Not being Amazon and not being able to control inventory, and access to that inventory, hurts.  However, probably a bigger issue is establishing consumer habit - triggering that need to order at the moment the user wants it.  This comes down to establishing a brand (expensive) and also evolving consumer behavior (more expensive).  And, these consumers will have to be in the < 200 geographical regions of the US that are dense enough to facilitate < 4hr delivery profitably (its probably less than 50 regions where you could fulfill on 1-hr delivery profitably at any substantial volume).<p>You could say Uber is a counter example of succeeding in this space.  I would argue that they replaced an existing consumer habit with a better one.  I don't see that in the same-day delivery space - thus the need for education.<p>There have been a few generations of these services (Webvan / Kozmo; Licketyship; Ecourier / Shutl; Postmates).  Eventually, the cost of tapping into consumer habit vs the small margins of brokering a delivery will create an amazing opportunity.  In the meantime, the cost of educating and acquiring users is a big deterrent and if you can build the kind of company innovative enough to solve this problem, its likely you have a prohibitively high opportunity cost.",1343860883

4326042,comment,4323091,4325515,3,0,bethly,,,"Well, it depends what you mean by ""effect"". I certainly think I cope with it better because I am aware of what is going on.  I'm experienced and successful enough to be confident in my code, and I got there in part by learning about sexism and how it functioned so I could sift what of my personal judgement was about me and my performance from what was about the people around me.<p>The whole experience is very lizard-brain; I can rationalize it after the fact and compensate for the dynamic when making decisions, but that doesn't completely get rid of the emotions in the first place.  Like how just because you know a film is a horror film doesn't mean you don't startle when something jumps out at the screen.<p>I don't know for sure if it affects my performance, since I haven't performed tests on myself, but I believe the evidence I have read that suggests it probably does.  I can't really explain the mental toll that that being a constant visible outsider takes, especially when people around you say things about the group you belong to without remembering that you are one.  It's not crippling, but it isn't pleasant either; sort of like wearing ten pound weights all the time.<p>I don't think having more women around would make me more confident in my job performance, but it would make me more confident in my employment and leave more energy to devote to the job.  Jobs, especially programming, include teamwork, camaraderie and talking with coworkers.  It's a lot harder to relax and fit in when you don't entirely no matter what you do.<p>I don't want to give the impression that this is all in women's heads either.  Groups of people bond over whatever they have in common, whether it is shoes, pets, culture or gender.  Right now, if some guy in the work place says something sexist or talks about how weird and incomprehensible their wives are or talks about typically-masculine things like cars or football or scotch or how they hate GUIs or how people need to stop being such pussies or how the best coders are all men, they are signaling group membership by defining themselves against another group, which I can't help but belong to.  Even if I don't say anything at all, just existing is enough to disrupt the maleness-centered bonding that would otherwise be going on (at best.  At worst I get ""complements"" like, ""oh, you're not like other women!"" and they keep on defining group membership in a way that would exclude me if they hadn't made some careful and possibly-temporary exception in their mind.)  \nOnce there are enough women in a space, dudes stop trying to bond over how male we all are and we can start bonding over the work we do or the books we like or whatever the reason is we are actually there.<p>I think when there get to be enough women in a group it improves some men's performance too.  There are some men who backlash when it happens because they have defined themselves by the masculinity of their groups.  They are the ones who talk about how we don't need to worry about there being no women in CS and how the whole thing is biology; those opinions don't magically change when women do enter a field, even though they become pretty silly. On the other hand, other men can stop worrying about whether they are acting manly enough and stop spending effort to hide parts of themselves to better fit in to unrealistic masculine norms and focus instead on the work at hand.",1343858921

For these customers, ARM delivers a gate netlist description of the chosen ARM core, along with an abstracted simulation model and test programs to aid design integration and verification. <i>More ambitious customers, including integrated device manufacturers (IDM) and foundry operators, choose to acquire the processor IP in synthesizable RTL (Verilog) form. With the synthesizable RTL, the customer has the ability to perform architectural level optimisations and extensions.

Command line compilers for the .NET languages are included with the free .NET runtime... also free. The C++ compiler is now free. Anything to encourage developers to build for the .NET platform, and holding just short of wiping out companies like Borland.""<p>- Joel (<a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html)</a>",1183027824

I spent all that energy trying to push Tcl over the years.<p>Rails is great, though, the only things that seem to come close are the Python frameworks, and I think at that point it comes down to a question of taste, and I think I like Ruby more than Python (even though I've used Python since...'99?  Before it was popular in any case).",1183025779

I think a lot of us are inspired by PG's writings because he comes across as someone who perhaps was not ""born"" an entrepreneur, and yet managed to be successful.  I know I identify far more with ""hacker"" than businessperson, so trying to make a go of being the latter is tough.  It's always good to keep an eye out for what else you could do well.",1183025515

58657,comment,58558,58558,0,0,Goladus,,,"First I'll tell my story to answer the question, then I'll put resources mentioned in a list at the end.  <p>I've been picking up bits and pieces, and would not call myself anything near an expert.  I knew what Lisp was from a Languages class in college, and we actually used lisp to implement a language.  Roughly none of it stuck, except for car, cdr, and the idea of using prefix notation and the 'everything is an expression' idea.  <p>Relearning it started with just reading PG's essays and getting curious.  Being too lazy to order it online, I looked in every bookstore and library I encountered for ANSI Common Lisp, but never found it.  It's rather pricey, too, which is why I was hesitant.<p>I started with SICP and the video lectures.  Something important came up in another part of my life, though, and I basically put Lisp on hold for several months.  <p>When I finally got settled down again, I started playing with with emacs-lisp.  I knew emacs would be useful no matter what happened next.  I downloaded the manual (which is dense) and scrounged for tips on the internet.  The idea was that I'd get familiar thinking in that style and using it for practical things, before moving on to something more serious.  Emacs-lisp has some limitations (no closures, for example), so it wasn't too long before I started looking elsewhere.<p>My next two sources were <i>On Lisp</i> by Paul Graham and <i>Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp</i> by Peter Norvig.  Both books include speedy overviews of Lisp, and point you to Guy Steele's <i>Common Lisp The Language (2nd ed)</i> (CTL2), which can be found online, for authoritative reference.  Both books are good because they are exciting and fun.  Norvig has a fairly gentle introduction, while Graham assumes you're already familiar with many Lisp operators.  I don't actually think that's a big problem, and you shouldn't let it scare you away from at least trying to read it.  I think it's easier to read the first few chapters of <i>On Lisp</i> first and get excited about looking up the details, than it is to slog through a reference or a mundane introduction beforehand.<p>I've set aside Lisp again, (though I'm keeping my eye open for opportunities to use it), though I have obtained a copy of <i>ANSI Common Lisp</i> which I also highly recommend.  Even if you don't need the introduction, the book includes a large reference section that's a bit more 'user-friendly' than CTL2.  The last significant reference I've used is <i>Practical Common Lisp</i> by Peter Siebel, which can be found online.<p><i>On Lisp</i>, by Paul Graham <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html</a><p><i>Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence:  Case Studies on Common Lisp</i> by Peter Norvig<p><i>ANSI Common Lisp</i> by Paul Graham<p>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual: <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/elisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/elisp.htm...</a><p><i>Practical Common Lisp</i> by Peter Siebel <a href=""http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/</a><p><i>Common Lisp the Language: 2nd Edition</i> by Guy Steele <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/html/cltl/cltl2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/a...</a><p><i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i> by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html</a><p>",1190593886

First, the situation may stay the same or worsen, but it won&#x27;t get better, so you should begin looking for a new job. Second, don&#x27;t talk to HR or make any formal complaints. Talking to HR makes it worst - they are there to keep the company free of trouble and liability, not to make your workplace better. Chances are if you talk to HR, they will tell your boss and everyone will start picking on you even more in an attempt to get you to quit. Talk to a lawyer to determine what type of documentation and evidence you need to take legal action, and get it. In the meantime smile and act like everything is fine at work. The most difficult part of this will be finding a competent lawyer who can help you stick up for your rights. It&#x27;s a bad situation, but good luck.",1433969929

Of course you aren&#x27;t paying mortgage interest but with mortgage rates at 3.5 - 4.25% it&#x27;s easy to find investments with higher guaranteed returns.<p>Infinite Banking (using overfunded, dividend paying, whole life insurance) currently has 4.5% guaranteed floors with actual rates with dividends currently at 5.0 - 5.5%.

9695323,comment,9692499,9694952,0,0,pg314,,,"In my experience, Lisp-style macros are much less error-prone than the Ruby/Python-style meta-programming. I think it is probably because macros transform the source code at compile-time while Python&#x27;s meta-programming happens all at run-time. Errors are caught earlier and it is easier to build a mental model of how a macro accomplishes what it does (you can just expand and read the generated code).<p>Debugging or understanding Python code that uses meta-programming is usually no fun at all, but I have had much less problems understanding Common Lisp code that uses macros. It doesn&#x27;t help that the meta-programming facilities of Python aren&#x27;t very well designed (more like an accident of the implementation than a real design). If you&#x27;re interested in a beautifully-designed approach to meta-programming (reflection and reification), &#x27;The Art of the Meta-Object Protocol&#x27; (Kiczales et al.) is absolutely wonderful. I don&#x27;t know enough about Ruby&#x27;s meta-programming to say if it&#x27;s better designed than Python&#x27;s.<p>Of course both macros and meta-programming can be abused, like just about any language feature can (there&#x27;s a series of mails that Guy Steele wrote to that effect as a reply to &#x27;Macros make me mad&#x27;: &#x27;Classes make me mad&#x27;, &#x27;Procedures make me mad&#x27; some years back on the ll1-discuss mailing list).",1433969840

Instead, I am using UglifyJS2 for my minification.  UglifyJS is very good, but the function inlining that Closure Compiler can perform is what I am really after.  (Closure Compiler is a real optimizing compiler!)  I&#x27;d use lodash everywhere without guilt!<p>For my builds, I am using Webpack, (but the same goes for Browserify), Closure Compiler was not designed to play nice with other bundlers - it wants to be its own complete ecosystem that is focused on Google internal needs/wants.<p>I want to write my code as CommonJS modules, and I want plugins that can attach at different stages of my build system.  For example, I want to be able to traceur --> lint --> closure compile --> karma test w/ coverage report --> bundle+source maps.  Plugins and Loaders in Webpack can be scripted to do this kind of build and that&#x27;s what makes large-scale JavaScript development possible.  Closure Compiler currently has some half-baked CommonJS support.  Even so, it does not seem possible to plug it into a bundler build system, given what command line options it has available.<p>If there was magically a closure-compiler-webpack-plugin package tomorrow that I could install into Webpack, I would be first in line to build with Closure Compiler and with Advanced Optimizations always turned on.<p>Closure Compiler might be 5 years old, but make no mistake, it is unique and awesome compiler tech!  I just wish it was a priority for Google to see it widely used in contemporary JS development outside of Google and apart from the Closure library.<p>If I have caught the interest of any Googlers reading this, I&#x27;d also ask that Closure Compiler support JSDoc3 annotations.

ROP relies on known or predictable addresses and pretty much all modern OSes have some form of address space layout randomization (which keeps getting better and more sophisticated).<p>> With good ASLR, ROP is not possible without relying on information leak bugs which are finite. So the cost for the attacker increases and it gets harder and more time intensive for reliable exploits to be written.<p>> Allowing JIT for everything is a TREMENDOUS security violation, since it&#x27;s trivially abusable and page permissions are irrelevant. There are just too many ways for clever attackers to abuse it.<p>Of course ASLR makes ROP harder. It makes all exploits harder. I still don&#x27;t agree with your last paragraph. As someone else mentioned, good JIT implementations never leave code both writable and executable. It&#x27;s simply not the case that &quot;page permissions are irrelevant&quot;. Page permissions are central because they defeat the specific attacks you have in mind. A JIT is no more vulnerable to them than the dynamic loader is.<p>I still don&#x27;t buy that banning PROT_EXEC buys you any protection from attackers exploiting applications.<p>On the other hand, banning PROT_EXEC provides plenty of protection against uppity application developers trying to &quot;abuse&quot; the platform you &quot;own&quot; by attempting to program in unapproved ways.",1433968892

I&#x27;ve seen what happens in large companies that don&#x27;t -- you get 15 teams building different versions of the same product, and internal politics decide whose version becomes the &#x27;official&#x27; one. But invariably, the internal user community settles on the one that&#x27;s actually best for their use case, so you end up having to support 3 or 4 versions of every product you create. It&#x27;s an absolute support and integration nightmare.<p>You talk about a business like it&#x27;s supposed to be a democracy. It&#x27;s not. You need clear direction, and democracy is messy and opaque if your company is too big for you to know the name of everyone who works there. Now the way you describe top down management is a bad implementation of it -- executives need to work to develop their middle managers -- but every company eventually has to convert from a democratic decision making process to a chain of command.<p>I&#x27;ve been working recently with a number of household-name startups that are having this exact issue. They&#x27;ve hit a plateau in their growth because the culture is dead-set against top-down management, but the company is now too big for people to self-organize. Engineering initiatives that would have taken 2 months in startup mode now take 2 years because they have to go back and rebuild half their systems to make them flexible enough to support the multiple use cases that they now have. Or because they were a startup, they didn&#x27;t worry about geographic redundancy because that wasn&#x27;t part of the MVP. So it was put off for later, and now they&#x27;re a billion dollar company operating out of a single datacenter because their databases and applications were built without multi-datacenter being a requirement.

The neoreactionaries do not demand total racial purity. But many seem to think that if multiple races live in the same country, the races should be placed in a hierarchy of power, status, and freedom, apparently based on the average IQ of their racial group. Since the movement is about European traditionalism, it&#x27;s not clear whether white people would be given a special place in the hierarchy, even above those groups whose average IQ is higher than that of whites.<p>As for women, many neoreactionaries appear to want them to return to traditional social roles - homemaking and child-rearing - and to submit more willingly to the sexual desires of men. Finally, there is some sense that within these group boundaries, the neoreactionaries might want a limited meritocracy - in other words, maybe the smart should rule. However, some neoreactionaries (particularly Anissimov) praise the idea of aristocracy, apparently believing that naturally superior people would manage to win the titles of nobility, and that their descendants would remain superior.<p>In other words, the neoreactionaries want the West to be a lot like the Ming Dynasty, but for white people. I&#x27;ve often thought of Europe as &quot;the China that never quite made it&quot;; neoreaction seems like the latest manifestation of a dream that refuses to die. &quot;",1433968623

The source cited by the article you link to says that &quot;Yes, African Americans and Latinos disproportionately commit certain crimes&quot;, and so actually provides some support for ESR&#x27;s argument. They do say that for drug use crimes, the crime rates are about the same for blacks and whites, but ESR was specifically talking about violent crime.<p>Also, they say that the differences in crime rates by race can be explained by socioeconomic disadvantages. But among the effects of socioeconomic disadvantages are poor early childhood nutrition and more likely exposure to toxic environments (hello, old buildings with lead paint!). These things tend to hold back cognitive development, which tends to result in lower IQ scores. So to deny a link between lower IQ on average and higher crime rate on average is in effect denying a link between socioeconomic disadvantages and higher crime rates.<p>Whether or not someone is being racist when writing about the link between IQ and crime depends on what they think is the causality behind the link between IQ and socioeconomic disadvantages, and the factors behind whichever one of those they think is the cause of the other. ESR may indeed be a racist, but you&#x27;ve not shown it, and the source behind your link could be reasonably cited to <i>support</i> the ESR statement you quoted.<p>We need to find some way to get some statistical sense into people at an early age, so as they grow up it becomes routine and automatic to recognize when you should care about group averages and when you should not.<p>In almost every situation where you are dealing with individuals, the fact that one individual comes from a group whose bell curve for some characteristic of interest is slightly displaced from the bell curve of the group that some other individual comes from is meaningless trivia when it comes to deciding which individual to choose for something that depends on that characteristic.",1433968415

9695089,comment,9690259,9693359,0,0,flycaliguy,,,"I&#x27;ll start with an angle that the decisions of one&#x27;s guardians have a large impact on their ability to escape poverty. The sad thing about this view is that if you hop back a generation, it kind of loops into itself. Hop back some more generations and some of these descendants are chained up on a boat from Africa...<p>&quot;Among African-Americans who have grown up during the era of mass incarceration, one in four has had a parent locked up at some point during childhood.&quot; [1]<p>&quot;America’s prisons and jails have produced a new social group, a group of social outcasts who are joined by the shared experience of incarceration, crime, poverty, racial minority, and low education. As an outcast group, the men and women in our penal insti- tutions have little access to the social mobility available to the mainstream.&quot; [2]<p>&quot;By and large, this research supports the conclusion that family income has selective but, in some instances, quite substantial effects on child and adolescent well-being. Family income appears to be more strongly related to children’s ability and achievement than to their emotional outcomes. Children who live in extreme poverty or who live below the poverty line for multiple years appear, all other things being equal, to suffer the worst outcomes.&quot; [3]<p>How exactly do people make their way out of poverty? Unless they win the lotto, employment is how it&#x27;s done. Do rates of employment fluctuate along with rates of laziness and poor planning? Or does the Keynesian theory in which decreased demand for goods and services make more sense? Does the Monetarist approach that unemployment is caused by high inflation and decreased investment sound more likely? Either way, it would appear that for many, finding full time employment with which to escape poverty isn&#x27;t always manageable.<p>A lot of it comes down to business cycles and the mobility of one&#x27;s skills as the economy evolves. Think of the regional structure of the economy. Sometimes an industry experiences a heavy downturn in an area in which it is highly saturated. Believe it or not, the personal losses that accompany it are not due to people getting lazier.<p>Do you know how big of a problem poverty is? Did you know that in the last 20 years we in Canada finally dipped our poverty rate among single parent families below the 50% mark? That is a lot of kids growing up in a situation in which no matter how hard they work, there is a lot to overcome compared to the middle class. Can you see how some of the situational issues might prevent them from escaping poverty no matter how hard they try? What about other at-risk groups like people with work-related disability, recent immigrants and aboriginals? Do you think these people are just not trying hard enough?<p>Your stance that poverty is the failure of the individual is a dangerous stereotype. It&#x27;s a type of blame-oriented belief with a dark history. It actually dates back to religious attitudes in the 16th century, when the paupers in the workhouse were dismissed as sinners. Social Darwinism eventually took it&#x27;s place, applying biological theories to social life and stating that the poor are simply biologically and/or socially inferior. That&#x27;s your angle, correct? The great depression was nothing more than a mass bout of laziness?<p>People are let go from jobs for reasons outside their control and many are unable to recover. People deal with issues outside of their control that are powerful enough to prevent them from escaping poverty. People below the poverty line tend to find themselves spending all their money and time attending to basic needs and are incapable of budgeting the time and money for learning new skills. Kids raised in poor families are not given a decent start in life.<p>You say you would love to see the data but I wonder if you would love to see it enough to search it out yourself? Have you already reviewed these points and decided they are false? I’m just spitballin’ here a bit, there is plenty more proof that poverty creates poverty and that social darwinist theories applied to labour markets is absurd and dehumanizing.<p>[1] Prison and the Poverty Trap <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/science/long-prison-terms-eyed-as-contributing-to-poverty.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/science/long-prison-terms-...</a><p>[2] Incarceration & social inequality <a href=""http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/DAED_a_00019"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/DAED_a_00019</a><p>[3] The Effects of Poverty\non Children <a href=""https://www.princeton.edu/futureofchildren/publications/docs/07_02_03.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.princeton.edu/futureofchildren/publications/docs...</a><p>TLDR: The opportunities people are given to build skills and an economy to support them dictates poverty.",1433968023

And including in the byte codes a means to read, modify, and re-execute any previous byte codes. The sum of actions of course will be constrained by what can be expressed in a byte code but given that, you are free to do what ever you want.<p>And of course any interpreter which was interspersing its data and executable byte codes in the same chunk of memory, well that would be a Von Neumann architecture :-)<p>[1] Harvard machines ultimately fell out of favor because you could end up with left over code store and not enough data store for an application.",1433968004

He&#x27;s great if you don&#x27;t know finance but his advice is geared towards people in the poor and lower middle class brackets that want to stay there.  Same with Suze Orman.<p>Get an overfunded whole life policy and put the extra money into that.  Google &quot;Infinite Banking&quot; or &quot;Cash Flow Banking&quot; to understand how it works.<p>Current guaranteed rates are 4.5% with dividends it comes out to around 5.5% (in the current market, it tends to follow interest rates very closely).  That&#x27;s 4.5% guaranteed for life from companies that have been around longer and still posted profits through the great depression, dot com crash, and 2008 housing crash.<p>Gains grow tax free and if you take it out as a loan it is tax free as well.  Any money you withdraw is tax free up to the amount you have contributed so far.<p>You can take out a loan for any purpose, for any reason, at any time.  If you don&#x27;t pay back the loan the company could care less because they are getting the interest and it just comes out of the death benefit.  Actually, they prefer you don&#x27;t pay it back because they make more interest.  So it really is win/win.  Tax free &quot;withdrawal&quot; for you and more interest for them.<p>Also, it&#x27;s a loan against, not a loan from.  That means you are borrowing money from the insurance company not your money.  The entire balance is still compounding.<p>And, as an added bonus, you are getting permanent life insurance for your family.<p>Some risks with paying off a mortgage earlier:<p>1) Equity in a home earns 0% interest.  You&#x27;re money is not compounding.  Got $500,000 in equity.  Guess what, that $500,000 is earning 0% interest.<p>2) Your leverage is decreased when you pay off your mortgage.  If you have only 20% down (500% leverage) and your home goes up 10% then you just made a 50% gain.  If you pay off your loan then your 10% gain becomes a 10% gain.<p>3) The money you put into your loan could have been earning interest.  Yes, you&#x27;re paying money on the mortgage interest but the mortgage balance is decreasing while the investment balance is increasing.<p>You can think of it this way.  Should you take out a loan at 5% to invest at 5%?  The answer is yes, you will come out ahead.  The reason is that you are only paying 5% of the whole amount in the beginning.  Towards the end you are paying 5% on a very tiny balance.  If you pay in level payments then your loan is effectively costing you 2.5% while your investment is getting 5%.  It&#x27;s net positive.<p>4) Paying down your mortgage means you have more money at risk and less options.  If you have some bad luck and default then the bank gets first right to all of your equity.  If that equity is stored in a whole life policy it is protected from creditors (may vary from state to state but most are pretty generous).  If the bank stands to lose a lot of money they will work with you and give you some flexibility, lower rate, allow you not to make payments for a while, etc.  If they can just foreclose then they will do that.  The reason a foreclosure is more favorable when you put in more equity is because they can sell it at a lower market rate and still get their money back.  If it is underwater and you have very little equity then they would be forced to take a loss from the foreclosure.<p>5) Your mortgage interest may be tax deductible depending on your circumstance.  You are giving that up.<p>Todd Langford has a really good series of videos that talks about finance and opportunity costs:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp1BZcex6ds"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp1BZcex6ds</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7QCe3rmAv0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7QCe3rmAv0</a>",1433967727

9694906,comment,9694689,9694689,0,0,briandear,,,"Hourly. I would never, ever do a project pricing again. You&#x27;ll get scope creep like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. Even if you have clearly defined requirements, the problem is that those requirements are never perfect, so they inevitably change as the project progresses (that&#x27;s the whole basis of what Agile is about.)<p>What you could do is this: you could &quot;secretly&quot; estimate the cost of the total project in terms of hours. Then you can decide how much you want to be paid for the entire project. Then divide that by the number of hours, giving you an effective hourly rate. Then you can quote that hourly rate for your acquaintance which perhaps a &quot;general estimate&quot; of how many hours it might take; don&#x27;t get too specific or else you risk painting yourself into a corner when things go wrong.<p>Personally, if it were me, I&#x27;d ask for a certain amount in retainer up front before you write a single line of code.<p>For example, if you think the project is worth $15,000 and you think it&#x27;ll take 150 hours, that puts your hourly at $100 per hour. I would ask for 10% of the project hours up front (after all, you are also incurring an opportunity cost by even accepting the job and there&#x27;s always the risk that you won&#x27;t get paid. Trust me on this! The most trustworthy people can often screw you out of money in the nicest ways.<p>So I&#x27;d say, &quot;It looks like, based on the requirements we&#x27;ve discussed that it would take approximately 150 hours to complete this project. That can vary considerably depending on any changes we might make as we make progress. I charge $100 per hour and require retainer based on the projected project duration (i.e. deposit,) which in this case is $1500 to start.<p>Our next payment will be due upon the completion of milestones that we both agree upon. For example, when your Facebook page is complete, etc. All hours that have been completed up until the milestone reached will be payable once we reach that particular milestone or every two weeks, whichever is sooner.&quot;<p>..or something to that effect. Even if it&#x27;s a close friend or acquaintance, do everything in writing, making it all crystal clear. I&#x27;d even use something like Basecamp (especially with their awesome checklists and milestones calendars) to manage it all. This will insure that your friend treats you like a professional and with that, you don&#x27;t get abused under the guise of &quot;friendship.&quot;<p>You certainly don&#x27;t have to do it how I suggest, but at least do the following:<p>1. Use a project management system, I suggest Basecamp, but there are others.\n2. Get your agreement in writing.\n3. Don&#x27;t commit to a project cost -- it will ALWAYS go longer than you think and &quot;one more thing&quot; adds up. The only exception to this is if you&#x27;re charging such an insane rate that you build the inevitable overruns into the price.\n4. Get paid based on milestones or on a regular time schedule (i.e. every two weeks.) I recommend milestones because it makes the client feel better, but I personally prefer time-based. If you wait until the project is &quot;done&quot; to get paid, then they&#x27;ll have very little incentive to pay and a very big incentive to drag it out/delay. Unless you control the server. Then if payment is 1 day late, you shut that puppy down until that money hits your account. If you do milestone payments and those payments are late, stop work and tell your friend, that you can&#x27;t continue until the payment has been made. Trust me on this. You will get abused if you let yourself. It has happened to all of us who&#x27;ve worked as freelancers!\n5. Treat this project professionally. You&#x27;re getting paid as a professional, so you&#x27;d better deliver as a professional, regardless of &quot;friend&quot; status or not.\n6. Keep accurate records of time. This is useful because it will give you data you can use later when estimating future projects.<p>Good luck! I hope that helped.",1433966583

And given that, the lack of hype has mattered very little to us, as it&#x27;s been a very good solution to our problems over the past five years.<p>><p>> That&#x27;s not to say that adoption doesn&#x27;t matter. The absence of a rich community around Google Closure has been disappointing. Only a single book on Google Closure has been published, and the surrounding tools have been slow to evolve. Contrast this with Angular, which has achieved off-the-charts hype and has developed a massive community despite minimal usage in production Google applications.

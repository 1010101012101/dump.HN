In this context, I assumed that ""logic"" really meant deduction or, at most, observations much less rigorous than science.<p>Now, assuming that by ""logic"" I really mean reasoning <i>without</i> observations, I hope my point becomes more clear. My impression is that philosophers do not really go in for scientific studies and experiments; if an idea proved logically by a philosopher contradicted sufficiently good experimental evidence, for some value of ""sufficiently good"", I would side with the evidence.<p>Hopefully my thinking is clearer now.

There are some tired mental states, when i don't think/forget to think about  types, but just write and call functions. It's at those times that i  find having to go back and read the original function for a type or having to go to REPL for testing the type painful.

Some code branches have system level calls changed, and unless you have very good unit test coverages (which may or may not need to be re-written on a library version upgrade) then you may or may not catch the problem during the upgrade.

But it's also more correct.<p>And this relates to a problem I've run into whenever you try to talk to an expert about something. People come up to me with fanciful ideas about physics and you have to stop them every five seconds to clear up what they mean by ""power"" or ""energy"". Or (as a favor) just listen all the way through and see if you can get a notion of what they mean so you can discuss their idea.<p>Same thing happens when I try to ask lawyers about something. I'm always getting asked, ""Do you mean a law, or a <i>statute</i>?"" or having things like ""well, that's a legal term-of-art"" given back to me.<p>The point being that it's hard to jump into thinking about anything that others have spent a long time considering and carefully defining.",1339135869

And I am happy that Hetzner kind of dedicated hosting services will keep EC2 kind of cloud hosting services honest.<p>We moved from a dedicated service to EC2 in 2010. At the time got some 30/40% drop in the hosting cost for the same traffic. As apart from marginally less hosting price, it also allowed us to start some instances in the day time and shut them in the night. So hourly billing is a plus.<p>Which also allows me to not shy away from experimenting before use. For example, on moving time we were on 32 bit and were running only small instances.<p>Now we have built 64 bit images which allows running of anything we like from small to extra-large. So for example at present we have 2 mediums and 1 small running in the day time. And just 1 medium and 1 small running in the night time.<p>And for some time in between tried it out with just 1 large and 1 small. I always need a small one. As there are lots of scripts which keep doing health checks etc. on each other, and can restart the other, on some conditions. So 2 instances are needed for reasons.<p>So you have to factor in these kind of reasons too. The dynamism it offers is a big reason (and need for some) to stay there when the other alternative is dedicated.<p>Sincere question: As I would like to be aware of some other good options. Does some other companies like RackSpace offer as much control as EC2 does?<p>edit: typos and minor rephrase",1339135574

You can't offer features without implementations; The feature will never be completely agnostic of its implementation. When you get a really strong shift in the possible implementations (for example: websockets or even long polling, vs rpc) then the feature (for example: dynamic UI), if re-implemented, starts exposing very different semantics and secondary features.<p>To sum it up: if you implement a thousand ORMs based on SQL db's then they're all going to look the same, implement one thing based on a NoSQL database and you suddenly see how the ""feature"" of ""storing data"" suddenly becomes something different from what could be anticipated by the people who designed the original ""feature"" back in the SQL era.<p>Let's not lie to ourselves and pretend that features are some wondrous thing poised in thin air above their implementations.",1339135468

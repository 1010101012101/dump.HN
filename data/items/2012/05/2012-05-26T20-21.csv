While said as an aside, if true, this is incredibly significant.

Whereas the price of many forms of energy has (if anything) increased in real terms.<p>A glance at the numbers suggests that the government put more taxpayer money into Solyndra type companies than it did into web startups, and that this was one of the things that drew less scrupulous venture people to the area: use the dumb money from the government for an exit.",1338065900

2. Current distribution networks for electricity do not work well enough to transport large quantities of electricity for long distances.
3. Due to getting rid of nuclear, 90% of new electricity production built to Germany before 2020 will be from fossil fuels.

And the fossil fuel plant's are not going to be closed any faster than nuclear plants. Those investments are for the next 60 years, and it's likely that there will be more if/when cleantech can't really deliver out all the things we need.<p>And that's a pretty good result btw, truly a world champion -level achievement. Meanwhile, Japan's nuclear phaseout is done with 99,999478% in fossils.

Tacos cost more per pound than bulldozers, and cost more to produce per additional unit than enterprise software (assuming off-the-shelf and not custom-built).<p>A taco has just as large a long-term commitment as any durable good.  The taco stand has to deal with more, in fact: if the shell is cracked or they forgot the meat, they have to deal with after-the-sale support.  If I come down with e.coli and am hospitalized for two weeks they have an additional degree of commitment and exposure to deal with.<p>The problem I'm describing isn't with custom-built, built-to-spec goods (like some software), but rather commodity durable goods and materials.  Whether I design my widget to be made out of stainless or titanium often depends on pricing, and determining that pricing carries unnecessary overhead which serves neither customer nor manufacturer.  The opportunity cost of opening the dialog with the titanium company's salesperson becomes nontrivial, because now I have to wait a few days for them to call me back to tell me it costs more than my alternative.  Salespeople should be taking down orders, driving traffic, cajoling hot leads, and negotiating discounts, not performing the work of a javascript in a significantly less capable manner.<p>Until someone does a double-blind study with identical products, my guarantee is based on anecdotal evidence (and as Bender once said, ""I can guarantee you anything you want"").

4028302,comment,4027209,4027472,9,0,entropy_,,,"Yes, but equating these two things together is disingenuous. If you've ever been to a 3rd world country you'd know why.<p>I'm Lebanese(small country sandwiched between Israel and Syria that specializes in fighting proxy wars) and I've been around(not to the US, but to quite a few places in Europe as well as other Arab countries). Things are just not comparable from one place to another.<p>Yes, human nature is corrupt. Yes, with enough money you can buy people's consciences(at least a lot of them). But it's extremely different when it's <i>systemic</i> rather just one-off individuals being corrupt. Government employees here <i>expect</i> to be bribed, you literally cannot get anything done without bribery.<p>A few examples. I know quite a few engineers who work in construction, ask any of them and they'll tell you that they have a well-defined budget for bribes. Whenever there's a construction project anywhere, police officers will drop in for surprise inspections and expect to be bribed or else will stop work from getting done. Most of the time there are no violations, but they'll disrupt you enough that it's just cheaper to pay them off.<p>Another example, a friend of mine drives a motorcycle. They are actually quite rare here[1](and nobody bikes). This is due to the fact that road conditions and driving skills of people are really bad so it's extremely dangerous for anything that's smaller than a car to be on the road. We have a vehicle tax here and along with paying that tax you have to take your vehicle for a yearly inspection(it's one process). This is extremely streamlined for cars(as there are many of them and it has to be a fast process) so not much bribery to do there. But my friend tells me he pays about triple the actual tax where the rest if bribing people to accept his tax payments and confirm that he's had the bike inspected.<p>I've been to Syria a lot and it's even worse there. It starts right at the border. If you don't bribe the officer conducting the inspection they will just keep opening bags, laptops and asking you about every single detail of every single item and being general dicks until you pay them ~20$(a lot of money in Syria). I was at some point traveling there with a friend who didn't want to pay on principle, they held us up for ~3hrs at least and then he payed anyway.<p>The list goes on and on, and this is just for personal stuff. For doing business(getting stuff shipped, getting any kind of license, etc...) it's even worse. My friend's father is an executive in the local branch of a big multinational fast moving consumer goods company and he's told me that they have a <i>lot</i> of problems operating in these parts because they have a lot of internal policies that forbid them from doing a lot of things that are just facts of life here.<p>TL;DR corruption in the 3rd world is something that permeates almost everything that you do. Equating it with some individuals being corrupt and self-serving is just not right. You won't know what I mean until you've tried it I guess.<p>[1] Note: this does not include a lot and a lot of un-registered, illegally-aquired, scooters that are some of the most annoying as well as dangerous things on the road. These are mostly driven by poor people and immigrants who can't afford anything else. Unfortunately none of them have ever actually learned to drive and it shows. But most of them don't really have a choice so how to deal with them is not clear.<p>EDIT: fixed typos and grammar.",1338064979

We're still very early in this, and the potential is enormous.</i><p>Here's one possibility: Sunny countries will begin to make a lot of money generating solar power and selling it to cloudy countries. North Africa, for example, could easily support all of Europe's electricity needs if we find some way to keep sand off the solar panels. But all of that money goes into the pockets of African and Middle Eastern autocrats, and the world enters a new era where everyone tries to grab the sunniest parts of the world ... umm ... wait a second, those are the same areas where we're currently killing people for oil. tl;dr: History repeats itself.<p>But on the flip side, solar energy would allow humanity to make good use of some of the most barren parcels of real estate in the world. Instead of using fertile fields to produce biofuel, we could use those fields to produce actual food and leave power generation to places like Arizona.",1338063382
4028219,comment,4027246,4028044,1,0,Tycho,,,"I'm not sure how valuable the bias from developer anecdotes is. Naturally patents are going to be annoying for the business that covets the technology they cover. If you have patents at all, you will have friction. Bit like how you can't have parking tickets without having people complain about parking tickets. The majority of users and developers the majority of the time have no trouble with patents. At which point you can argue that it's a hidden cost, something that affects all of us without being immediately obvious. And that's precisely my point... if it's a hidden cost, it could equally be a hidden benefit.<p>I just don't see much worthwhile dialogue going on in the patent debate, just shouting in both directions. For instance in this article, it's not clear to me what people are objecting to. Are people annoyed because someone is trying to enforce a patent? Or is it just because a group of large companies have acquired the patents? Does that imply that we're happy for small companies to have patents, because they'll probably never enforce them anyway, but unhappy for large companies to have them, because they'll actually put them to use? Or is it the nature of the patents (I don't see much analysis of what the patents really cover... they could conceivably be things which took a lot of R&D)? Or, indeed, is it the concept of patents in general? The article did mention stifling innovation, but that's a bit vague - it stifles business activity but that energy could arguably be used on alternative that would be more innovative.",1338063370

It's definitely a game that you spend a lot of time talking about playing it instead of actually playing it.<p>Personally I'd tell anyone else to avoid it having been through it and come out the other side. It just doesn't give you much for the time spent. The ships look great, but don't expect either elite or tie fighter.<p>The pve is terrible, though diverting enough for the first month or two. Unless you really like collecting stuff and making a mega pimp mobile, it rapidly becomes extremely dull.<p>One of the addictive things about it is how 'risky' the pvp is as the ships you use are worth days in mind numbingly boring grinding. There is a heavy death penalty if you are using a 'good' ship and it's one of the only things that actually makes it fun, you do get an adrenaline rush from it. But the actual combat lasts 30 seconds-1 minute and it often will have taken you hours to find that one combat. Get caught by the wrong thing and you're guaranteed to die.<p>There are very few massive fleet battles. In fact more time is spent with FCs avoiding the enemy than actually fighting them and when you do get in a battle you die as soon as you're targeted as it's 100s of people shooting you in tandem. The weapons have far too long ranges so the most effective tactic is everyone shoots at the same target. Do not choose a name that starts with a-f, you will always be primaried.<p>Although there are more creative ways to make in game credits than grinding, you can even buy it (they have regulated RMT).<p>Be aware that they allow in game scamming and the game is pretty rough round the edges so it's very easy to fall for. Often you'd not think that's the way a mechanic is supposed to work.<p>Also there are generally 2 or 3 ships that are terribly overpowered at any one time in game. They usually take a year to fix them. If you plan going pvp it's worth finding out with the FOTM ships are from the beginning<p>As someone else says get a good corp quick. Reddit have their own one.<p>TLDR; If you want to get a taste of what it's like actually playing eve, open up a chat window with some friends and then 'spin' the ship in that web GL browser.<p>That's what you'll spend most of your time doing in eve online.",1338062658

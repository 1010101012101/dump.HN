Fortunately, this wasn&#x27;t a problem because as long as the first 8 characters matched you could type literally anything and the password would get accepted.<p>Funnily, the admins apparently really cared about security very much, so they required users to change passwords every few months. It was possible to change <i>asdfghjk</i> to <i>asdfghjkl</i> and keep logging in with <i>asdfghjk</i>. I kid you not.",1445687958

But it gets a lot more credit than it is worth.<p>Using dictionary words reduces the entropy of your password significantly. And for a cracker it can be trivial to attack passwords of that form. Given the sort of compute power you can obtain cheaply nowadays, attacking 4-word schemas (especially given people tend to use common words) is not hard.<p>It&#x27;s to some degree security through obscurity: no, a cracker will not know your schema in advance but he will attempt to attack multiple schema types. If you&#x27;re the sole target then that&#x27;s probably not a concern - it would be a major effort, with limited rewards, to attack your unknown password schema. But if yours forms part of a larger set of passwords being attacked (where the use of multiple schemas and attacks will reap high rewards) then you&#x27;re at more risk.<p>IMO, for all the password schemes that people come up with there is no good alternative to a long, randomly generated string with multiple character types.<p>Always use a password manager!",1445687883

The value that someone accrue by owning land is 99% of the times based on the surrounding 99% of society increasing that value.

Chinese or buying apartments cash. Go to Miami and you will see plenty of amazingly expensive apartment complex be ghost towns because it&#x27;s owners live in Brazil and just have it as a backup.<p>The people who actually develop new areas with a few exceptions are artist and young people who make an area hip enough that developers want to a house here and there and slowly but surely push out those who made the area worth investing in to begin with. Who benefits. Some of the people who lived in the neighbourhood for a long time but had nothing to do with the increase in value of a place.<p>Infrastructure choice isn&#x27;t irreversible it just takes time. London wasn&#x27;t bombed to anywhere close to the degree of a place like Berlin so of course it wasn&#x27;t really going to change the width of the street.<p>More taxes on land is solving the fact that urbanization is pushing people to move into the bigger cities. Again reasons unrelated to the fact that someone own land.<p>There are plenty of ways to discuss taxation on land that would be both more effective and fair. There is nothing useful about people using property as an investment tool it just drive prices way up.<p>We should reward money that work and tax money that doesn&#x27;t.",1445685031

If a property is your only home anywhere in the world, then it should be exempt, but anything outside your main home could be taxed. That should discourage those people who buy property but barely live there from driving up prices for the people who want to live there.",1445684826

All the same caveats of past releases apply: work in progress; use at your own risk; the language <i>will</i> continue to change; code that you write now <i>will</i> break in subsequent releases.<p>0.6 should be a rather exciting cycle though.

Assuming that just pointing at the root of another API is going to mean your app will magically behave properly using both API's is making a lot of assumptions either in your app about how the API's work. For example, say one API calls a delete call ""delete"", another calls it ""remove"", another calls it ""obliterate"", and at the same time one API takes an id on that method as input, another takes an email address, another takes a username. In that scenario your app might be written to remove something based off an id and when you switch API's the new one expects you to obliterate based on username. Hypermedia doesn't save you there.<p>I'm all for pluggable protocols and standards, but Hypermedia links in your API don't magically get you there.

I say ""claiming"" because it is impossible to say that a single <i>group</i> of people are believers, regardless of what group that is (Baptist, Methodist, Lutheran, Catholic). So I personally do not believe evolution, based on my reading of the first book of the Bible, but some people claiming Christianity do. Maybe I'm the one that is wrong! I'm ok with that, because in the end my believing creation || evolution isn't what my salvation hinges on. We have certain beliefs that we have to hold with open hands, and some that are closed. That Jesus paid the price for my sins, that is a closed-hand, absolute for me. Creation vs Evolution, I care wayyyy less about. I believe creation, you (presumably) believe evolution. Awesome, let's chat about it.<p>As far as the creation-is-science point, I believe it to be so only because I believe it to be true, so it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy.

This is just for fun but who knows it might help some of you. Feel free to add more lessons learnt and have a safe 12-21-12.<p>Mayans were extremely confident and precise in their astronomy and thats the reason they have predicted that the World will come to an end on 21st Dec 2012.<p>Lesson learnt: If you believe in your product then sell it with conviction.<p>We came to know about the Mayans and their predictions by watching and listening to famous astronomers, geologists and archaeologists who were having full faith in what Mayans have predicted.<p>Lesson learnt: A good product is not only conspicuous to the VC but proper marketing also plays an important role in introducing the product to the World.<p>With some comfort now I can say that the myth of 21st Dec is almost over, but we have to wait for another scary prediction and who knows it might be better than the one what Mayans have predicted.<p>Lesson learnt: Prepare for the failure.

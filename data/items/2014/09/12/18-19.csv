8309754,comment,8305283,8309691,1,0,pflanze,,,"OP said &quot;I went for a file-level copy because then I&#x27;d know which files contained the bad blocks&quot;. When you copy the block device with ddrescue (dd doesn&#x27;t have logic to work around the bad sectors and the only sensible action for it is thus to stop, but don&#x27;t take my word for it), the result will just have zeroes in the places where bad blocks were, and, assuming the filesystem structure is good enough (you should run fsck on it), will give you files with zones of zeroes. But you won&#x27;t know which files without either comparing them to a backup (which you won&#x27;t have by definition if you&#x27;re trying to recover) or with a program that verifies every file&#x27;s structure (which won&#x27;t exist for the general case). Whereas cp will issue error messages with the path of the file in question. So the OP&#x27;s decision makes sense.",1410548379

Its clear the review process was yielding vast quantities of invalid patents. Making the courts invalidate them one-by-one is crazy. Classifying them all as assumed-invalid would send a very clear message to the patent office that it seriously fouled up and needs to straighten up in evaluations, and also let patent trolls know that their payday is over. Proving validity puts the technical burden on the patent troll, which in almost all cases would be nearly insurmountable, since virtually all these patents would likely be recognized by juries as obvious and invalid.",1410548316

I&#x27;d think the typical user/consumer would more likely have 1000 mp3 files rather than 1000 personally authored Microsoft Word documents (or Photoshop PSD files, etc.)<p>What about another common usage such as digital camera photos?  The digital camera (or iPhone) has jpg &quot;files&quot;.  How would the user mentally translate the &quot;files&quot; living on a FAT32 flash card and copy them to your &quot;Library Items&quot; storage system?  Do they keep 2 mental models of storage paradigms in their head?  If your proposal includes a driver/wrapper for hiding the FAT32 file inside the concept of &quot;library item&quot;, it seems like you&#x27;re just renaming &quot;files&quot; to &quot;library items&quot;.  It&#x27;s more a shift in terminology rather than shift in paradigm as a sibling comment already noted.<p>The filesystems in an operating system (NTFS, ext3, etc) are already implemented as <i>special purpose databases</i>.  The &quot;rows&quot; are file id entries and they each point to the &quot;blobs&quot; which are the file contents.  Whatever you propose to build has to reimplement this underlying &quot;database&quot; as well.  Whether you call the rows of that database &quot;files&quot; or &quot;library items&quot; or &quot;objects&quot; or &quot;documents&quot;, it isn&#x27;t going to revolutionize the approach.",1410548221

Meetups; i.e. if it&#x27;s a Ruby shop, you could sponsor, participate, or simply attend Ruby meetups.  Creating awareness of your company and meeting people/making a positive impression could only help spread the word.<p>2.  Industry events; i.e., a founder of an EdTech start-up could meet some helpful contacts or even directly connect with engineers passionate about your specific field of work/product/mission.<p>3.  Your existing network: mentors, accelerator partners, CS professors, old colleagues on LinkedIn, etc.  It never hurts to ask :)<p>3.  Unique perks; first one that comes to mind is potential for remote work.  Given the adventure (read: nightmare) that is LA traffic, this could draw lots of attention.  I understand it&#x27;s difficult as a small start-up, as cohesiveness and face time is important, but even one to two days/week (or the potential for more once the employee&#x27;s established) could set you apart.<p>FWIW: I run a tech recruiting agency with a distributed team around the country - LA is one of our cities.

A return to their roots. Programming a computer today is like moving by telling every single muscle what to do. To make writing code easier we want to be able to do more with less, to have the code figure out from context what the best thing to do is. We want more intelligence in our compilers. It is telling how powerful the notion of AI is when so many world changing ideas (functional programming, OOP, search, Databases [influence goes: prolog -> datalog -> SQL]) are compromises, failed attempt and detritus of AI projects.",1410547210

After every cleaning, I tell myself that I&#x27;m going to look for a real cleaning service company next time. But then the low prices keep me coming back to Homejoy.<p>I&#x27;ve found the quality of service from the Homejoy cleaners to be insufficient. Every time it&#x27;s always a different problem (I try to schedule cleanings when I&#x27;m home). One cleaner spent a disproportionate amount of time cleaning the toilet, and then didn&#x27;t have time to clean the bathtub (I ended up scrubbing the bathtub myself after the cleaner left). Another time, the cleaners forget to dust off the TV stand, and I had to do it myself. I&#x27;ve had to clean or re-clean something myself about 80% of the time I&#x27;ve used Homejoy.<p>My complaints may sound insensitive, and fall under the category of &quot;first-world problems&quot;, but when both my spouse and I are working long hours, hiring cleaning services can become very helpful (it&#x27;s a common anecdote that hiring a housekeeper can save your marriage).<p>As the article states, my suspicion is that in this &quot;independent contractor&quot; model, Homejoy does not adequately train its contractors in cleaning, nor are the contractors they hire experienced in the cleaning industry. I remember reading that Homejoy used to put their contractors through an orientation/training program, but it&#x27;s obviously not enough.<p>I&#x27;ve used other housekeeping services from real cleaning companies before, and they&#x27;ve always done an amazing job, especially compared to Homejoy. They&#x27;re just usually two to three times more expensive. But maybe next time I&#x27;ll really switch back to a real cleaning service (or at least try to find a city-single independent on craigslist).",1410547093

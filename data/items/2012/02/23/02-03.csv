3623596,comment,3622412,3622412,3,0,LocalPCGuy,,,"This post is quite misinformed, IMO.  Yes, many apps ask for the permission to post to your wall.  You can say no.  You can also go into your Facebook settings and remove that specific permission from the app, and then the app can no longer post as you, but the login functionality would still work (assuming they were halfway competent in their coding.) I often will remove the wall posting permission right after I grant the permission.<p>And as to the proposed solution, Facebook doesn't need to do anything.  Those developing the apps don't NEED to ask for the permission to post to your wall.  The developers (and business rules) determine what permissions to request, and we frequently build apps where all we ask for is basic information or basic + pictures, for example.  There is absolutely no reason that the developers MUST ask for permission to post to your wall except that they are going to do it, probably without asking you first (which is EXACTLY what you granted them permission to do!)<p>So the answer to the problem is, don't login with apps that require you to grant permission to post as you.  Or, immediately deactivate that access if you must use that app.  Or do as others have mentioned, and just set that app to only be visible to you.  You get the ""benefit"" of the posts, and it doesn't go out to anyone else.<p>The real problem is, most people just don't care.  Facebook gets 80% CTR on permission dialogs, and almost 50% of people prefer social login to creating an account or using a guest account.  Facebook has a great incentive to make sharing as frictionless as possible, so we are only going to see more ways to share things easier.  I'm not saying that sharing is bad or evil, just that people should be making that choice consciously, not just blindly clicking it.",1329965860

You could probably still reconstruct account information for many users (and even after anonymization a lot is revealable (see the AOL search logs debacle)), but, again, this is quite different than logging data associated with an account and using it to target advertising.<p>> We strike a reasonable balance between the competing pressures we face, such as the privacy of our users, the security of our systems and the need for innovation.

3623575,comment,3620184,3623240,2,0,fdr,,,"> Additionally, if fsync = on in this test, then you're mixing a file system test with a database test.<p>Which is reasonable, given that file systems of any reasonable performance level (read: not user-space file systems) still tend to be bundled with one or at most a handful of reasonable kernel implementations.  Turning fsync off would highlight some interesting bottlenecks, but I'm not sure if that makes for the most sensible comparison either.  Not only is the fsync/checkpointing period of a database's operation important to model in a broad-spectrum benchmark, but some amount of file system coupling is unavoidable.  One example is metadata syscalls to the file system, which have been a point of poor concurrency before[0]<p>I agree the fsync = off benchmark would be <i>interesting</i>, but I don't think it's fair to say that the information of an fsync = on test is a) less valuable/clearly improperly performed b) necessarily indicative of the most important bottlenecks for database workloads.  A kernel that takes a huge lock during fsync(), for example, should be penalized for it.<p>Finally, fsync = off doesn't accomplish the stated goal of ""independence"" from the file system.  And as seen in Robert Haas's post, non-fsync file system calls can be the problem in high concurrency situations.<p>[0] <a href=""http://rhaas.blogspot.com/2011/08/linux-and-glibc-scalability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rhaas.blogspot.com/2011/08/linux-and-glibc-scalabilit...</a>",1329965322

3623567,comment,3622729,3622729,4,0,CPlatypus,,,"I was going to type this on my own Transformer, even got several paragraphs in, but I'm finishing on my Mac.  See point 8 for why.<p>(1) The battery life really is awesome.  I get a full day of near-continuous use - including video and such - out of the internal battery, plus another out of the battery in the dock.  On the downside, the USB charging cable is non-standard with respect to both form factor and voltage.<p>(2) The trackpad really is useless.<p>(3) The task switching is just as bad as the author says.  Each time I start Firefox, I have to guess whether it will have my old tabs or a clean slate.  It's impossible even to know whether it will show up in the app switcher.  <i>Usually</i>, if one application (e.g. twitter/email) invokes another (e.g. a browser), the second will disappear from the app switcher until you explicitly go back to the first, or else you have to go back to the home screen and launch from there.  Even that broken behavior's not consistent, though.<p>(4) The built-in email program sucks, and K-9 is almost as bad.<p>(5) There's no decent ssh client.  I have two - one which does tunnels but has atrocious keyboard handling, one which has semi-decent keyboard handling (Ctrl actually works and I can simulate the missing Esc) but doesn't do tunnels.  Unfortunately they're incompatible with one another in some weird way, so using both simultaneously is a bit tricky.<p>(6) I haven't found a program to create/edit slides.  I've tried for Android office apps, and as many online apps including Google's own.  <i>None</i> could handle so much as a simple bullet list properly.  Most couldn't even put the cursor in the right place half the time.<p>(7) Text selection and cut/paste sometimes work (inconsistently across applications) and sometimes they don't.  Cursor keys sometimes work and sometimes they don't.<p>(8) Stuff on the web can be very flaky.  Text-entry boxes (e.g. here) often don't scroll properly as you type, so you have to scroll manually.  Sometimes you lose the ability to reposition the cursor either by pointing (see point 6) and never had it via cursor keys (point 7).  That's why I'm on the Mac now, after two rounds of that.  On other sites (e.g. Quora) text-entry boxes fail to keep up with typing and just randomly set you back to the start every couple of words or so.<p>That's a lot of glitches and complaints, huh?  I must hate this thing with a burning passion, right?  Actually I love it.  For video, games, and passive content consumption it's pure awesome.  It's light, the screen is a joy, changing orientations on a whim is incredibly handy.  As soon as I try to <i>do</i> or <i>make</i> anything with it, though . . . well, then it becomes a big sack of awful.

A lot of people (myself included) have stories about getting an awesome job that they almost didn't apply to.

3623509,comment,3622774,3622963,2,0,lsparrish,,,"That's not a premise of it at all, if you ask me. For all we know reanimation may in fact be <i>much</i> less costly to the given future society than current medical efforts are to current society. Anyway the default expectation should be that it is a hard to develop <i>process</i>, but easy to apply to many patients once developed. It could be as simple as pushing a button or throwing a switch, once developed.<p>Fewer patients in existence would make it less likely to be worth the initial investment in the process if the cost is large -- a classic scaling problem. Imagine if operating systems or web browsers were only used by a few people in the world; it would not be worth investing nearly as much effort into them as we do. It is also much cheaper to store many versus a few patients for long periods of time, at least if we are counting costs on a per patient basis, because of the square-cube law and its effects on heat transfer to and from large versus small bodies (dewars).<p>Furthermore, when patients go into cryostasis they always place money into an investment fund where it generates interest. The decision to invest that money instead of spending it wastefully during their lifetime or on prolonging their dying moments is one that benefits the people of the future steadily over a long period of time. All this talk about pushing the load onto the future or depending on future generosity is therefore silly. Yes, people in the future do have to cooperate in a prisoner's dilemma by not killing the patients and stealing their investments, but that's simple non-defection of the sort we routinely expect from peers (you probably won't kill me and steal my stuff). We aren't expecting any extreme sacrifices on their part, as long as the trust funds are not overwhelmingly evil about their investment strategies.",1329963840

It's elegant but inefficient. In the initial version of HN I used closures for practically all links. As traffic has increased over the years, I've gradually replaced them with hard-coded urls.\nLately traffic has grown rapidly (it usually does in the fall) and I've been working on other things (mostly banning crawlers that don't respect robots.txt), so the rate of expired links has become more conspicuous. I'll add a few more hard-coded urls and that will get it down again.",1329963760

Each vendor can submit the optimal configuration for their system, and they all run the same benchmark.<p>At the end of the day, each vendor is going to publish benchmarks that show their system performing better than all others.<p>It's your job, not theirs, to verify those benchmarks for your particular work load.<p>Edit: Also, while Mongo wouldn't classify as a distributed store, Cassandra definitely would. In fact, it's more ""distributed"" than Riak, since you have to pay Basho for multiple DC support (unless that's in the open source version?), whereas Cassandra is completely free.",1329962879

If it's true, it only proves their legal system concerning sanitary measures has way to broad categories and somehow olive-oil (food-based) falls into 'food' while running an online store falls into 'having a place where you deal with food'. Providing stool samples of shareholders is just an extreme example what happens when laws are too general and not in time with modern business models and current technology. It's easy to figure out that broad laws open to interpretation are easy to abuse by corrupted officials.",1329962645

3623461,comment,3623268,3623268,12,0,DrJokepu,,,"It's called a continuation. Continuations are essentially closures being passed around to represent state (hence ""fnid""), check the Wikipedia page on them for a proper, computer sciencey definition. The nature of Lisp really lends itself to continuation-based programming. Sometimes (like on HN) it's used in web applications. In the context of web applications, it's a different approach than, for example, REST/MVC. It has a few nice properties, such as easy state management. This can be very useful when a web application is an interface to a process (e.g. checkout in a web store) as opposed to CRUDA. On HN, it allows paging that ""remembers"" the order of things at the time you visited the first page. Reddit uses a similar mechanism. The obvious downside is that you have to keep track of all those states and if you lose them (for example because they expire), the user workflow is interrupted (hence the error message).<p>It's not the trendiest programming technique around these days but it's a useful tool in the toolkit of a good developer.",1329962581

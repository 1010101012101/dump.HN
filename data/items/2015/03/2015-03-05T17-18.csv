    a   b    (* a APPLIED TO b *)

You also can basically just desugar them to let bindings<p><pre><code>    a ; b
    ==
    let _ = a in b

    a ; b ; c ; d e
    ==
    let _ = a in 
    let _ = b in
    let _ = c in

Due to static typing it&#x27;s vanishingly unlikely that a forgotten semicolon will properly check.<p><pre><code>    let this = x ; y (* if x : &#x27;a       and y : &#x27;b then this : &#x27;b *)
    let this = x   y (* if x : &#x27;a -> &#x27;b and y : &#x27;a then this : &#x27;b *)

And continues to.<p>I&#x27;ve seen plenty of behavior from men (or boys) that makes me cringe.  I&#x27;ve called it out at times.  I&#x27;ve also seen (or received) it from women.  And, for that matter, men.  Truth is we&#x27;re sexual creatures, and the boundaries between professional and personal <i>do</i> get crossed.  Failure to recognize that (and behave accordingly) <i>is</i> a problem.<p>I&#x27;ve also had my own issues with behavior of others from time to time.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll comment, but if I&#x27;m at at a structured event that doesn&#x27;t work (and I&#x27;ve met plenty of people of various stripes and persuasions who seem dead-set on finding an argument), I&#x27;ll find someone who can intermediate -- an arbitrator frequently does blunt the emotions of to principle antagonists.<p>Could there be reasons for Adria&#x27;s behavior in her own personal history?  I&#x27;m not a psych professional, but I&#x27;ve had my own personal experiences (some extremely painful, damaging, and expensive) and done a fair bit of reading (including of psych texts and manuals).  Seems valid to me to conclude that it very well might.  And that if she does in fact have a history of such behavior, she&#x27;d do well to receive some sort of assessment and therapy for it.  And I wish that she lived in a society which made such treatment far more accessible.  Her behavior certainly has interfered with her professional and personal relationships, from the evidence I&#x27;ve seen.<p>But people own their <i>own</i> responses and feelings.  An irrational or aberrant response is just that:  irrational and aberrant.  A person with a mortal fear of snakes shouldn&#x27;t work in a reptile exhibit, a pyromaniac shouldn&#x27;t work at a firehouse.  And a woman who&#x27;s constitutionally hostile to white men should probably find herself a position where she&#x27;s not called on to deal with them diplomatically and spread corporate good-will.<p>Someone whose response to everyday situations gets other people hurt, or fired, or threatened, isn&#x27;t behaving normally.  Adria&#x27;s response in this regard is no more valid than the road-raging executive, the raving street person who attacks someone for no reason, the child who throws a tantrum, or the jilted lover who goes into a screaming rage encountering an ex on the street.<p>Was she rightly fired?  Absolutely.  Ideally she wouldn&#x27;t have been hired for the position in the first place.<p>The threats she&#x27;s received since?  Uncalled for.<p>Her failure to own her own actions and recognize her error?  Inexcusable.<p>Oh, and the answer to men and their behavior around women dressing or acting provocatively?

Of course, I&#x27;m sure that you don&#x27;t associate with people who routinely crack sexist or racist jokes (neither do I, and I think we have the same reasons), but &quot;never laughed at a racist joke&quot; is unlikely to be true, even if you so much as watched Tom and Jerry when you were a kid.<p>I&#x27;m sure you never laughed in good humour at something you <i>perceived</i> to be racist, but are you so certain that there is <i>no one</i> who holds the bar as low as you do? For everyone? Remember that scandal with the Super Bowl commercial, where they sang America the Beautiful in nine languages, and every ultra-conservative man was offended? Were they wrong?<p>> Now, and this is important: I didn&#x27;t call Hank&#x27;s joke &quot;sexist&quot;<p>You didn&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the accusations brought to him were of &quot;sexism&quot;, not &quot;sexualization&quot;.<p>> But Hank needs to understand that a joke like this with a sexual context, <i></i>in the absence of mitigating factors<i></i>, does contribute to that just-us-guys, implicitly-othering culture that doesn&#x27;t need to outright say &quot;no girls allowed&quot; to make it feel that way.<p>&quot;Was a private conversation&quot; is a pretty mitigating factor in my book. Even in a professional setting.<p>> It&#x27;s important for me to stress that this is not to say that you cannot joke about sex or race. But it&#x27;s not funny when you punch downward. Louis CK is a wonderful example of this. His jokes reference women and minorities all the time--but the jokes aren&#x27;t about them, they&#x27;re about him and his reactions to them based on his own personal context.<p>I&#x27;m preeeetty sure Hank&#x27;s point was also not offensive towards women, either. He literally made a joke about cocks. Should I also be offended, because he was kind of implying that, as a man, I&#x27;d probably stick it everywhere? Come on...<p>> When it&#x27;s the result of four hundred years (and more, really, but let&#x27;s just be geographic here) of concerted activity on the part of society to constrain and hurt the people we consider less privileged today, I think it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect understanding and respect on the part of the people who&#x27;ve profited from it.<p>I don&#x27;t think you are wrong, I just think that woman&#x27;s interpretation of this was extremely hypocritical. I cannot sympathize with that washed out a reaction. Throughout her life, and that of her mother, and that of her grandmother, women have had pretty much equal rights. Everyone she can remember has literally had more rights in her own country than my grandfather had in his (for political and historical reasons). If she claims to be offended by this kind of stuff, <i>she</i> is the one who&#x27;s being an asshole, exactly like that kid in school who was butthurt by everything that didn&#x27;t fit his temper was an asshole.",1425577730

It doesn&#x27;t matter one little bit what the female numbers are in proportion to the male numbers.  And what the female numbers show is that around 1985, women generally stopped wanting to earn CS degrees, preferring medicine, law, or physical sciences.  The graph does not say <i>why</i>.  It just suggests that women very abruptly reversed the previous trend and started choosing other careers.  It also happened before the vast majority of people now working in the field had graduated from elementary school, which suggests that it is an <i>institutional</i> bias, and not a personal one.<p>It&#x27;s easy to guess at the reason why, but those guesses would not be supported by anything short of surveying actual women with college educations, asking them &quot;why not computer science?&quot;<p>My hypothesis is that for those answers that cite the composition of the CS classes and faculty as a contributing factor, it wasn&#x27;t because they were full of <i>men</i>, but because they were full of <i>nerds</i>.  For a variety of reasons revolving around the capricious cruelty of adolescents, females are less likely to be in the nerd social caste, and possibly also strongly conditioned to avoid it.<p>That social dynamic fuels a lot of nastiness later in life.  Sex balance in the workplace may be just another symptom of it.<p>But really, it&#x27;s all useless speculation until someone actually goes out and asks some people about their reasons for doing things, in a manner that avoids known biases.",1425577420

Development of the AFS kernel module started in 1983, so the code is a decade older than Linux itself. So it&#x27;s hard to argue that openafs.ko is a derivative work of Linux, and since it continues to run on several kernels other than Linux (Darwin, Solaris, NT, etc.) and the Linux-specific code is just glue code to make it work, it&#x27;s not really obvious that it&#x27;s become a derivative work of Linux. (OpenAFS is free software under the IBM Public License, which is a GPL-incompatible free software license, and the rightsholders will not relicense. The Linux kernel infrastructure assumes that any non-GPL kernel module is proprietary, for extra amusement.)<p>Along the same lines is the kernel module for VMware Workstation, the desktop product that runs on Linux as well as Windows and Mac OS X. It doesn&#x27;t predate Linux, so the argument is slightly less clear.<p>VMware&#x27;s vmkernel, as I understand it, is an amalgamation of VMware&#x27;s hypervisor code (that predated ESX, and originated on  Workstation) plus Linux. I think it conceptually started off as a Linux server with the existing kernel module, but both have evolved quite a bit. I think the remaining Linux parts mostly exist as hardware drivers, and VMware is providing the core kernel routines like scheduling and memory management and &quot;world&quot; management (equivalent to process management, but it&#x27;s a hypervisor).<p>I think that VMware&#x27;s argument is that they did not start with Linux and add proprietary features to existing GPL&#x27;d code and call it proprietary; they started with their own code and linked in parts of Linux via well-defined interfaces, and they&#x27;re happy to comply with the GPL for the parts that came from Linux, but they don&#x27;t want to GPL the entirety of the ESXi kernel.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the concept of address space isn&#x27;t a legal concept, just a technical one. We generally acknowledge that it&#x27;s not a GPL violation to run proprietary applications on Linux, even applications that use Linux-specific interfaces like cgroups and epoll and signalfd and all that good stuff. Is this simply because the Linux kernel copyright explicitly disclaims virality to userspace, or because there&#x27;s some fundamental legal reason why userspace and kernelspace are far enough apart? Can two components in ring 0 also be &quot;far enough apart&quot;?",1425577059

Can you nail that point?<p>I suggest no such thing. It is a scale. I deliberately avoided the phrase &quot;human-level intelligence&quot;, but any definition of AGI would do.<p>Even so, if you want to count all life as &quot;a little intelligent&quot; then it still took a billion years of planet-wide chemistry to stumble upon it (ignoring the Earth&#x27;s cooling). Still far more effort than fertilising a human egg.<p>> One possible definition is: To act adequately in an environment requires intelligence.<p>This is no less ambiguous, since you&#x27;ve not defined &quot;adequate&quot;.<p>> How might a piece of software act adequately? By above reasoning it has to resist to termination.<p>That does not follow. &quot;Termination&quot; is the mechanism of natural selection, so all systems undergoing natural selection will biased to resist it (otherwise they&#x27;d be out-competed by those who do). If we use some unguided analogue of natural selection to create intelligent software, then there would certainly be such a bias.<p>However, my point is that unguided evolution is <i>not</i> the right way to create/increase intelligence. As soon as we try to influence the software&#x27;s creation in any way, either through artificial selection criteria or by hand-coding it from scratch, we introduce new biases which may be far more powerful than the implicit &quot;avoid termination&quot; bias.<p>> But I think, when software starts to trick users and admin into not shutting them down, some threshold has been crossed.<p>That&#x27;s called malware... ;)",1425576034

9152092,comment,9150511,9150511,0,0,graycat,,,"This whole thread totally loses me:  I don&#x27;t
<i>get it</i>.  Here&#x27;s why:  To me, the <i>coding</i>
is and for decades has always been fast, fun,
and easy.  Similarly for the <i>design</i> or
<i>architecture</i> for projects up to, say,
50,000 lines of code and several servers
sharing in the work and <i>sharding</i>, etc.<p>Piece of cake.  Simple.  No issues.<p>But there are issues, huge, humongous issues:
The main issue is just and simply making
use of the documentation, and <i>object oriented</i>
classes, and other software
developed by others.  E.g., I&#x27;ve gotten --
found, downloaded, categorized, indexed,
and abstracted -- 
well over 5000 Web pages of relevant documentation.
At 10 a day, that&#x27;s a lot of days.<p>E.g., learning SQL was easy, piece of cake,
obviously built a lot on set theory in
pure math (which I know pretty well and
have used a lot), and I learned SQL reading
Ullman&#x27;s book over dinner at the Mount Kisco
Diner during about two weeks.  No problem.
How the log file works?  Fine.  <i>Entity, attribute,
relationship</i> design -- sure, easy.<p>Then the
real problems:  I tried to install SQL Server.
What a mess.  Maybe it got installed.  Someone
sent me a database, and I wanted SQL Server to
recognize it.  Nope, we&#x27;re talking high end,
world-shaking research here, unsolved problems
of the universe, much like dark energy.  As I
recall, my little effort ruined the SQL Server
installation.<p>So,
I make some progress doing some simple things
and then go for an <i>update</i> (general rule:
never update unless totally necessary).
The install asked a lot of questions with
no explanations or references to what the
heck might be the appropriate answers.
Somehow I got two installs, using Microsoft&#x27;s
<i>side by side</i> (I&#x27;ve written lots of programs
and they all run <i>side by side</i> as far as
I can tell -- what&#x27;s the issue here?),
and the install ruined my system.
SQL Server uninstall wouldn&#x27;t.
System repair wouldn&#x27;t.  So, the
SQL Server install broke my installation
of Windows.
I reinstalled Windows and all my
software to a freshly formatted hard
disk partition.  Then I tried again.
Eventually I got the SQL Server install
to work -- eventually.  The mud 
wrestling went on this way.<p>Ullman&#x27;s book, SQL, etc. were easy.
Getting a good install was
a barbed wire enema with an
unanesthetized upper molar
root canal procedure while being
poked with a dozen red hot branding
irons.<p>Then came time for the code of my
Web pages to connect with SQL Server.
So, I need a <i>connection string</i>.
Yup, we&#x27;re looking at a challenge
at least 1/3rd of a Nobel prize
in physics.  It took a week, a solid
week just to get a connection string
that worked.  Why it works, I still
don&#x27;t know.<p>Due to the times installs ruined
my boot partition, I wanted to backup
the partition so that I could
quickly return to a good system
after some install had ruined it.<p>So, I used NTBACKUP.  It asked if
I wanted to save &quot;system state&quot;
but had no explanation of what was
meant by that.  They are talking about
my options for Outlook?  For
the fonts on my text windows?
Well, after reinstalling all my software
several more times, I finally got
good notes and experience with
both saving a boot partition and
being able to do a restore that
would boot and be good.  Hint:
Yes, very much do save &quot;system
state&quot; or the saved copy, 
restored, won&#x27;t boot.  Yes,
that NTBACKUP does a <i>volume
shadow copy</i>, that is, saves
a boot partition while that partition
runs, is super nice, but writing
documentation on &quot;system state&quot;
was too difficult for Microsoft.<p>Net, the <i>coding</i> is fast, fun, and easy.
The difficulty is the documentation
and workings of other code that
needs to be used.  And now we have
to use a lot of such documentation
and code.<p>Anyone have a way around the
problem of such documentation and
code?<p>&quot;Learn to code fast&quot;?  That&#x27;s less
than 5% of the work.  The other 95%

The reason people talk about &quot;Wall Street&quot; is because we&#x27;re talking about public companies, who are beholden to stockholders. &quot;Wall Street&quot; is the generic concept of stockholders. And the one thing stockholders as a generic concept (&quot;Wall Street&quot;) was is profit growth. Because shrinking profits leads to lower stock price. It doesn&#x27;t matter that you were profitable, if you weren&#x27;t <i>more</i> profitable than last year, the generic concept of stockholders (&quot;Wall Street&quot;) will, in a generic fashion, lose faith in your company. And if your stockholders lose faith in your company, they vote out your board of directors and replace them with people who <i>will</i> bring growing profits. It&#x27;s not always the case (Amazon is a major exception), but in general, it holds true.<p>If you still don&#x27;t think Wall Street has even an indirect say in what games get published when and at what quality, then I don&#x27;t see a point in continuing this discussion. But I&#x27;ll leave on the point of SpaceX not wanting to go public until they make it to Mars, because Elon doesn&#x27;t believe that stockholders will let him take the risk of sending humans to another planet. Or, taking a step back from Wall Street and just talking investors, the idea from this very community that any exit for a startup is good and is favorable for your investors even if it leaves your customers high and dry. Or how about when Steve Jobs was pushed out of Apple because he wasn&#x27;t making enough money? Apple raced to the bottom and lost, hard, in the pursuit of maximizing profit.<p>I&#x27;m not trashing the idea of Wall Street or of investors. This is EA&#x27;s fault. But saying that investors don&#x27;t influence a company&#x27;s products is insane. Of course they do, to the fullest extent that the company will let them. Again, if you don&#x27;t believe EA is completely controlled by their investors, take a look at the timing of the end of their fiscal year, the rushed release of SimCity, and the announcement of Maxis being shut down.

It&#x27;s a totally valid approach with lots of merit — complexity can be a killer. In addition, the concurrency primitives, decent stdlib and tooling make Go pretty great to use in some respects. It&#x27;s likely to be well-supported for a long time and is a suitable tool for many tasks.<p>On the flipside, using it often feels like a bit of a slog. Error handling is simple (good) but repetitive (bad). Keeping generics out of the language avoids complexity (good) but results in repetitive and awkward code (bad). Lack of features like pattern matching and higher-order functions makes some code irritatingly tedious to read and write. And so on.<p>Point is, it&#x27;s perfectly valid to look at these decisions and say &quot;I don&#x27;t like Go because it is missing these features&quot;, as much as it&#x27;s valid to say &quot;The simplicity of Go is a useful feature&quot;.

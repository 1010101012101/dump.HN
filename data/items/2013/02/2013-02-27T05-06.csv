5290905,comment,5290132,5290132,8,0,pseut,,,"I like ""number theory"" as a favorite example of practical reasons to fund seemingly impractical and useless academic research.  A quote from Hardy (who I think was a number theorist, but could be misremembering) that I like is:<p>""I have never done anything 'useful'. No discovery of mine has made, or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least difference to the amenity of the world... Judged by all practical standards, the value of my mathematical life is nil; and outside mathematics it is trivial anyhow. I have just one chance of escaping a verdict of complete triviality, that I may be judged to have created something worth creating. And that I have created something is undeniable: the question is about its value.""<p>And I can't find a quote, but I think I remember reading that he viewed his mathematical research as consistent with his pacifism, because nothing he developed could be used for military purposes.<p>Of course, now that we have computers...<p>But, given the different channels that research can become commercially viable, and given the long and uncertain time lags before new developments in research show up in GDP, a statistical analysis based on aggregate data is going to be absurdly difficult.  And there are other reasons to expect that private companies will underspend (from a societal-benefit point of view) on research that has positive spillovers/externalities (really quickly: they're only going to want to spend to the extent that they directly benefit.  If there are benefits that they can't profit from, as a society we'd want them to pay for the research anyway, but they'd be crazy to).  So funding as much research as possible seems like a decent approach.<p>Incidentally, this is the first time I've seen someone claim that the US or Canada governments have massive research expenditures.

Even with data plan sharing its too much. You could say the same about the cellular iPad but the way these devices are used is just a lot different. Most of the MacBooks are just too big to use this way. You have to stop somewhere, take it out of a bag and sit it down. At that point is turning on tethering, activating a wifi cellular AP, or even plugging in a USB modem all that much of an extra burden? It's already not so practical. The iPad though can be carried outside of a bag and used standing or even walking. I would at least consider the cellular iPad but so far have not opted to get one for some of the same reasons. Turning on tethering isn't very hard and it works great. Both the iPad and MacBook are distant seconds for me in cellular data usage and would continue to be even with integrated cellular. The iPhone just covers my needs for that stuff. So my guess is Apple hasn't done it because there's just not a big enough market.

Get a standing desk and foam pad (the foam pad is for your feet, because they'll get sore without it. I think the term for them is ""anti-fatigue mat""). Alternatively get a chair with proper lumbar support. When you stand, notice how your spine curves inwards. When people sit their spines often curve outwards (slouching). A chair with lumbar support properly pushes and supports the spine so that it curves inwards.<p>2. Google articles on proper ergonomics and adjust your keyboard and mouse accordingly.<p>3. Exercise in the morning before work. That will make you feel a lot more refreshed. Exercising <i>after</i> work in the evenings is all well and good, but it feels a lot better to do it in the morning.<p>4. Get enough sleep.<p>For work:<p>1. How good of a rapport do you have with your manager/boss? If you have a decent relationship, straight up sit down with your boss and tell him/her that you want to have a conversation about your career, you're looking for more of a client-facing role, leadership role, and/or product management role <i>in the near future</i>. Regardless of your relationship with your boss, ask him/her, ""What will it take for me to move into X,"" X being ""client-facing role,"" ""product management,"" ""being tech lead,"" ... take your pick. I think <i>it is counter-productive to talk in negative terms</i> - i.e. how much you're dissatisfied with work - and <i>it is much more productive to talk in positive terms and in terms of the future and in terms of how you want to contribute at a ""higher-level"" in the future.</i><p>2.

When you're in school you usually end up friends with people who happen to be in your classes, people who you happen live with, people who happen to be in clubs you're in, etc. Without something like school that puts you in constant contact with people, you yourself need to make an effort to befriend people you meet who you find interesting. If you meet someone interesting at a meetup or company-related function or a bar, etc., not only should you <i>ask</i> for their contact info (if you give someone your contact info there is a 50-50 chance they'll never contact you), you need to make the effort to set up lunch/dinner/drinks/coffee with that person.<p>I don't claim to be successful in getting myself to do all of these all the time, but I always try to accomplish these goals and I think they're a helpful set of guidelines for you.",1361943205

5290821,comment,5289532,5290532,23,0,Terretta,,,"Not trying to pile on, but Daiz's comment...<p>> <i>re-encoding with Beamr could potentially make the streaming experience worse due to the fact that Beamr does not seem to set any VBV options[2] for their encodes</i><p>...is crucial if you're sharing video online.  As a video delivery network (VDN), we run into badly encoded streams all the time.  Clients can play the files locally, but after uploading to us the files don't stream or stream badly when trying to play online. Daiz's comment mentions one of the more subtle causes of such problems.<p>If you are streaming video to end users, which is what most people here on HN are doing with video, keep in mind that users' bandwidths are generally constant. Someone with a 756kbps DSL line cannot magically download at 3 mbps during the explosive parts of your video.<p>Most encoding guides you find around with x264 settings are for your own content on your own computer, and neglect the options necessary to ensure your video doesn't use up bits faster than your pipe can refill them.  Most pro encoding tools miss these settings as well.<p>In the old days (Windows Media) for the best streaming video quality, you could use constant bit rate (CBR) but define a long window for the CBR measurement, say, 15 seconds.  That would give you variable bitrate from second to second (say, a scene change), but limit your bitrate to the CBR over any given 15 second window.<p>x264 has options that allow the same thing, essentially defining how many bits you need to have in reserve to encode complex parts from, and what constant rate can refill the reserve.  For a good streaming experience, this is more important than ""frame by frame quality"".  Casual users might not notice a 10% difference in picture quality, but everyone notices if the stream pauses.<p>Here's an explanation or two:<p><a href=""http://codesequoia.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/what-are-cbr-vbv-and-cpb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codesequoia.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/what-are-cbr-vbv...</a><p><a href=""http://aviadr1.blogspot.com/2010/12/vbv-for-dummies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aviadr1.blogspot.com/2010/12/vbv-for-dummies.html</a><p>See link [2] in parent comment for the VBV settings you need.<p>All this said, I can see a use case for Beamr for utterly non technical users that want to archive their own video from Bluray or DVD or broadcast quality digital sources.  Looks like this tool can approximate a reasonable guess at perceptual quality with ""zero config"".  As others have said here, I personally prefer to do that by having a multicore encoder and let x264 apply as much look ahead and calculation as it can to take advantage of motion calculation and perceptual quality. Play around with those settings till you hit an encoding time that you're happy with, then with those set, find the CRF that looks good to you, and you're pretty much set from then on.  Just encode future videos to that CRF and you'll be happy with the quality -- x264 will pick unique bit rates tuned for each video that give you the PQ you want.",1361942491

5290804,comment,5290371,5290371,6,0,siong1987,,,"This sounds really cool but one thing that this blog post didn't mention is that there is memory constraint on each dyno.  So, this model might work if you have a Rails[1] app that doesn't use up a lot of memory.  And, since Unicorn forks as worker processes, so, 2 unicorn workers will use up double the memory of a typical Rails app.  If you have a really huge Rails app, you could still end up using only one unicorn worker for your Rails app, which is the same as just using any webserver on one dyno.<p>One interesting thing about the post is the mention of Puma[2] as the webserver for Rails app.  Puma is thread based, so, its memory footprint is significantly less than unicorn.  So, in theory, you should be able to handle more concurrent requests(more threads) per dyno with Puma.<p>Btw, don't just blindly follow the post.  Make sure you test your app and see whether your app use up more memory each dyno allows.  If your dyno runs out of memory, Heroku will just silently drop all your requests.  So, you might end up having a worse problem.<p>[1]: In general, Rails uses up quite a lot of memory on cold start.

The same argument could be applied regarding children smoking cigarettes, but I presume* that you don't think that the doors should be thrown wide open to kid-focused tobacco advertising because parents should be ""more responsible for their children's health"".<p>You do realize that you're saying ""tough shit"" to the children too, right?  You know, those whose outcomes are the whole point of these discussions? They're ultimately the ones who have to deal with the consequences the most, and for some reason dismissing their stake in this with ""you should have thought about that before you decided to have irresponsible parents"" doesn't seem to hold much water.<p>Note that I'm not making a point for or against regulation of advertising unhealthy foods to children, but dismissing the comparison to tobacco with ""parents should be responsible"" is beyond silly.<p>*If my assumption is wrong and you are actually in favor of completely allowing the advertisement of tobacco to kids, then never mind, disregard this comment.",1361941301

5290740,comment,5287890,5290275,-2,0,cookiecaper,,,"Right, I never said it was impossible to build something useful in Django. I just believe it's a non-optimal choice, in almost any situation. I don't believe ""it's just a matter of taste"" to have a web framework that knows its place and makes it simple to adapt, or unpretentiously allows you to code with minimal rigidity. I don't find any contrary arguments presented thus far convincing.<p>Saying that Pyramid's documentation and overall ""fit"" is ""less appealing"" is a matter of taste. Indicating that Django is much bigger is a matter of fact, and that it provides little if any additional benefit and increases rigidity and practical obligation to conventions is a matter of informed analysis. The argument to be made, then, is why that obligation and rigidity and bigness are valuable, which thus far, no one has really done.<p>It's not necessarily Django's fault. Pyramid is a much later framework, and alternate implementations of pieces of the full stack like Jinja2, Mako and SQLAlchemy became mature after Django was initially conceived. it's nothing personal to Django or the people involved in it (I've even submitted patches, but to my knowledge, they were not merged). It's just a thing that has been superseded, and that happens in tech. Now it's just a matter of how long until everyone else can drop the religion and admit they're wasting time on compliance and rigidity that shouldn't be there.<p>I'm not saying Django is the least productive framework in existence. I'm not saying it'll ruin your company or life if you use it. I know people who use it and we are able to get along. I work with it occasionally. I'm just saying, ""it's unwise"", for almost any large-scale new project.",1361941261

But if industry is biased toward applied/translational research, perhaps it's not just a focus on short-term profitability or a lack of funds for large projects.  One interesting idea is that patent laws are partially responsible for this bias, because they grant a temporary monopoly on inventions/applications, but not on basic science.",1361941212

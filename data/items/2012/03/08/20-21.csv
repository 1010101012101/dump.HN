For being a multiplayer, non-story driven game, it is still one of the best games I've ever played.<p>I am a little miffed that they never upgraded the console versions and I've never really played it on PC.

3681600,comment,3681202,3681577,9,0,tptacek,,,"The premise of your outrage is that the TSA has some authority over the media that they are abusing. The TSA has no authority over the media. The media routinely publishes terrifyingly sensitive government secrets over the direct and strident objections of the DoJ and gets hauled into court to defend itself. That the media has a pretty excellent track record in those courts is not so much my point as that the media has so much experience building that track record that only the dumbest reporter would give half a shit whether some TSA functionary ""strongly cautioned"" them not to run a story.<p>Since this observation isn't so much ""insightful"" as it is ""completely obvious on its face"", to me, Occam's Razor suggests that what the TSA was implying was that the guy was <i>wrong</i>, and that his story was going to make the media look dumb.<p>Since I have never once seen anyone from the TSA land on the right side of an argument, from airport security to spelling and grammar, we don't have to argue about which one of us is more vehemently contemptuous of it, or, in this case, its argument.",1331240320

3681575,comment,3681202,3681202,2,0,chao-,,,"What really has my interest is not the TSA's request/threat. That part is unsurprising. Instead, my mind ran through a few ideas about what a news story on this topic would entail. From the last time I bothered to watch CNN, I recall they've acquired a penchant for saying ""And a viral video of [topic] is hot on the Twitters today!"", showing the video, getting someone in-house to do surface analysis, reading off some Facebook posts, and cutting to commercial. Ideally, a reporter does their own investigation on the topic, either by contacting the TSA and arranging to film while testing the scenario depicted here, or by doing a more undercover verification ala the video itself.<p>I don't wish to be specifically judgmental of CNN, and I don't wish to over-analyze my mock-scenario. Instead I'm using the thought experiment of a news report on this topic to express frustrations with journalistic practices I have already seen elsewhere. It seems to me there isn't as much motivation on behalf of larger news organizations to put together a verified report, when you can replay something from YouTube and people will believe it much the same.<p>But maybe there are positive aspects? Crowdsourcing the genesis of news topics allows for a better breadth of topics, clearly. And I recognize there is a need for it in situations such as the Syrian unrest, Tibet, or any place that foreign journalists can't easily access. I get the feeling though, when I go to 'old' media, that I expect old media standards and practices. When I go to 'old' media and get a replay of internet videos followed by an equally-long segment of internet comments, I wonder why I'm not just browsing the internet for myself.",1331240032

The problem is its standard library. The ""get this new language"" teams should instead focus on how to <i>incrementally</i> improve C. D was a (bad IMHO) attempt, just retry and make it better, a step after the other. If we will wait the ANSI committee we can all get old with strcpy().<p>IMHO one of the few things that should be addressed at language level is that structures with function pointer members should have a way to be called with the implicit structure pointer (something like ""this"") as argument.

Post rebase, we see branch work serially, which makes it easy to find a bad commit, and obvious to see the transformations of the main branch of code.<p>I think people who complain about this fall into one of three camps:<p>1 - Are not using a topic branch workflow, and don't understand the hell that wreaks in history\n2 - Are doing fast forward merges to merge branches back into the mainline, which makes it hard to see the points that development finished and the merge actually happened.\n3 - Are rebasing long lived branches<p>It is just such a common complaint, and I have yet to hear of any down side that actually makes sense to me as someone who has a fair understanding of git",1331239484

3681515,comment,3681315,3681315,3,0,drostie,,,"If you wanted to get to that rather ambitious destination from your starting point, I would suggest that you would have to build a (very basic) product idea from scratch in JS + PHP + MySQL on month 2, or at the latest, month 3 -- just so that you know what the Web 1.0 technologies were. It would be one heck of a rush, but thankfully, you wouldn't necessarily have to market it. (Although you should spend a couple days learning XSS and XSRF and guarding your site against them, salting and hashing passwords against database compromise, and so on.) If you know that many-to-many relationships require a new table then you've at least got the basics down. If you can JSLint your code and understand which of the good parts of JS are good and why, then you've got those basics down, too.<p>As for the first month, it's worthwhile to learn two programming languages at once, so that you don't get ""locked into"" one particular way of thinking these things. Python's generators represent probably the prettiest iterative programming I have seen, so you might want to go with a functional language to balance it, so that you're forced to think recursively. If you're really ambitious you'll do Haskell, but that's a bit crazy, and more conservative would be to take the Abelson-Sussman lectures, crap though their audio might be, so that you learn a Lisp:<p><pre><code>    http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/\n</code></pre>\nOkay, so assuming that you've spent your first month learning two languages to tackle problems, then your second month learning the core web languages and getting some project done, what would you have to do your third month? There are a couple of options for an aspiring junior developer. One would be to write a totally new application in some other language, so that you can see what the other ones are thinking. You could go with the language that you started with, and code in Python's Django, or the confusing language that you only half-know, called JavaScript, by developing chat rooms in Node.js -- but those are probably boring, and you might want to spend a whole month learning Ruby and developing with Ruby on Rails. (It could make you much more attractive to a random employer.)<p>If you have done all of those and have not passed out from exhaustion, then you might start to refactor a project. Figure out the ugly stuff you did in month 2, and how to make it not so ugly. Ask people on IRC to look through your code. There is a central principle of writing good essays and novels: ""There is no good writing, only good rewriting."" If you come back with fresh eyes you can actually learn a lot. What library functions did you accidentally forget to use when you were writing PHP? (PHP has huge libraries and if you try to code something on them you're liable to end up on TheDailyWTF.)<p>And your fifth month, after all that work, should be devoted to some wild project which strikes your passion after the past four months. I imagine that you'll be lost and confused by month 3 and that month 4 will be a breather, then month 5 is to really take a new idea that's way out there, and make it shine a little.<p>At least then, you might have three projects you can point to with an employer and say, ""look, here's a portfolio, it's not as visually polished as you might like but I was focused on functionality and it all works.<p>If you could really stay committed, then I think you could have a quite spectacular resume for applying as a junior developer in 5 months of full-time work.",1331239315

Is there a market here big enough to justify the existence of your company? Even if your CAC is low and your LCV is high, are there more than 1000 people that need this, and are they willing to pay a premium for what you offer?<p>I'm genuinely curious what kind of customer development you've done to demonstrate that you're solving a hair on fire problem.

But yes, even with a cracked screen, back your shit up using the cable before going into the store -- it'll save a step for the Genius and make it more likely you get a free screen.<p>A fresh account is less likely to have random stuff (desktop full of files, random app windows, customized settings, ...), so it's easier for the tech to work with.  They usually ask for the username/password, and note it somewhere -- if it's the default (apple/apple), it's easier for you (you don't need to change your account password) and for them (if the note gets lost, or if your password is absurdly long or complex).<p>With Filevault 1, you'd be safe as a logged-out user even from an admin on the system.  With Filevault 2, they went FDE, and assumed systems are dedicated to single users, or that unix file permissions would be the only protection between user accounts, so one admin account can read everything.  (I actually use separate drives when I send machines in for repair -- doing this on the MBA is slightly harder and requires a service tech agreement with Apple).<p>This applies even more so if you have something like PGP disk or Trend or Wingate or whatever which makes booting more complex.",1331237278

I quickly realized that there was a lot of repetition, and that in theory it should be possible to automate, though I had no idea how. So I hit the books, learning everything I could about SAS  (the main repeated tasks involved reporting/analytics) and Windows Powershell. Eventually I figured out how to automate it all, and did so. This freed up time for a lot of people, let the company hire less, allowed them to meet government deadlines that would have brought the wrath of god upon them if they failed, cancel a $1.2MM consulting project that would have taken 2 years and accomplished half of what I did, made it massively faster to create new reports, drastically reduced our error rates...<p>So basically, the key was that I really put in the effort to learn the business processes and politics, and just assumed that it would be somehow possible to automate all this stuff without really knowing how.",1331237239

Of course, you should keep taking the CS courses.  At the very least you should pick up a minor and, if you feel up for it, go ahead and double major, but the other degree should be your focus.<p>After you graduate, you'll be out in the job market with thousands of other programmers.  You'll have some nice coding projects under your belt, as will they.  However, when Google/Facebook/Apple is looking for someone on their secret new NLP project, being the only applicant with a degree in Linguistics puts you at the top of the pile.  Blizzard won't care if you forget a few semi-colons in your interview code if you can point to your senior thesis on medieval siege engines and discuss how they'd work in Diablo 4.  Heck, if you're just in it for the money, J. Random Consulting will shell out the megabucks if they can charge for you as both a programmer and a CPA.  If you want to go the startup route, what better way to find a niche than to spend four years working on problems generally solved by people who can't code.<p>Besides, even in the worst case scenario where you can't get a coding job that has anything to do with your major, you now have a degree in a field you enjoy and can drop out of the programming rat race if you ever burn out.",1331236833

985929,comment,984930,985811,0,0,tokenadult,,,"The percentages matter, but the numbers matter too. Taiwan had nearly a 10 percent surplus of men when Chiang Kai-shek's defeated armies settled there in 1949. Women who were young in the 1950s in Taiwan (I have spoken to many of these about that era) remember fondly that they could be very choosy about whom they married. Many men in that era never did marry. (Taiwan has had tolerated prostitution throughout the postwar period, which presumably is how the unmatched men dealt with being unmatched.) Today, Taiwan is a HUGE destination for young women from poorer countries (there are a lot of poorer countries than Taiwan, notably Vietnam) who are brought in as ""mail-order brides"" for older men. But for China to do the same, the Communist Party would have to explicitly give up the claim that it eliminated prostitution after ""Liberation"" in 1949, and the number of women needed to move into China--from countries that themselves often have shortages of women--would be enormous. Absolute numbers matter. It's much more difficult for China to deal with this problem than for any other country, because of the sheer size of the problem.",1260374072

If every small business (or individual) were responsible directly for their own health care costs, a catastrophic illness in the pool would most likely cause bankruptcy.  By spreading the expenses (in the form of premiums) across a large pool of people (both healthy and sick), costs are levelled to everyone's advantage.<p>2) Even for groups with large enough risk pools to manage their own risk (i.e., companies of over 500 employees, generally speaking), health insurers provide a useful services in terms of negotiating discounts with hospitals, and in the formulation (and execution) of rules (such as which services are covered, what the co-payments should be, etc.).

985897,comment,985874,985874,0,0,patio11,,,"This is one of my periodic pain points with Rails, as compared to Java.  At the day job I work with multiple code bases with more than X00,000 lines of code each.  My Rails site has 5k lines as reported by rake stats, and due to a combination of poor IDE support compared to Java and the toss-it-all-in-one-folder Rails conventions, that sometimes results in headaches.<p>My suggestions:<p>1)  Refactor like it is going out of style.  Rails classes (particularly controllers and models in my experience) have a tendency to accumulate cruft over time.  Periodically evaluate whether something should be broken into two classes, or at least two files.  Mixins and require are your friend here.  (Breaking a controller into two changes URLs by default.  I think letting Rails assign publicly visible URLs is a mistake, but most people do it.  Consider carefully whether you can accept URLs changing as a result of code changes.)<p>2)  Encourage internal code reuse, and better separation of responsibilities, by breaking things into plugins when appropriate.  I extracted code from my own classes to make A/Bingo for example.  It keeps my own classes readable and makes it much easier to publish and reuse A/Bingo.<p>3)  Coding conventions are your friend.  Since the IDE lacks a reliable jump-to-definition-of-this-function feature, I tend to try to put predictable things in predictable places.  For example, model classes always have a consistent ordering of filters, validations, and associations at the top of the file prior to business logic.  (Those could be externalized if they got realllly messy, via the magic of require.)<p>4)  Put partials into thematically coherent subdirectories.  This saves you from having to find the right form partial from a directory with 20 views and 50 partials.",1260373069

I'm working on a project, and lately I've noticed that it seems to be getting harder to navigate and develop as it gets larger and more complex. Is this a sign of it maturing, or am I doing something wrong? What do you guys do to help manage your codebase when it gets somewhat large?<p>(This is my first ""real"" project using Rails, so I have no previous experience on this question :P )",1260371851

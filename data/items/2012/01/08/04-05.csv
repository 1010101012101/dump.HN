My point is that microsoft maximizes profits by making licensing so complicated that a significant percentage of their customer base over-pay for licensing rather than take the risk of being under-licensed.<p>Since you took the path of least resistance, you may have overpaid for licensing.  If your goal, as a business, is to maximize profits, well, then, you've worked against your long-term goal.<p>It may be that the cost of overpaying microsoft for licenses was cheaper than the opportunity cost of figuring out how to pay less for licenses.<p>Which brings me back to my main point, it is no disgrace, as an engineer, to decide that Microsoft licensing is a problem better avoided.",1325998314

I.e. make the 80% use case as simple and clear as possible, and let the programmer change it if needed.. instead of providing hundreds of useless configuration (knowing exactly that you'll encounter a case where you'll have to hack your way in the code anyway because it wasn't part of the ""configuration"").<p>I'm not bitching in any way on the existing jQuery plugins. I used (and keep using them) again and over again.. but for good javascript developers, simple plugins easily hackable is most often than not the easiest way to get the thing done.<p>For instance, Django provides a good authentication system.. and then lot of different ways to customize it. It's good.. but it happened to me lots of time to hack my own solution as what I wanted to do wasn't part of their initial ""configuration"" thingy. Some django plugins were created for that, but then again, they were hard to hack as 80% of the code base was to handle all the possible ""configurations"". So, basically, sometime the easiest way to get something done is just to find a snippet of code that does the minimum and code the missing part.. instead of using a huge plugin that does <i>everything</i> but still need to be hacked (Which is way harder the more the plugin is complex).",1325997539

Its rare for an entrepreneur to run a business and spend millions of dollars without having any outside help.  When that is the case, its a normal reaction to wonder: why?  Why hasnt outside money been raised?  Its unfair, but saying that its never come up would be a lie.</i><p>I'm sure github wouldn't have any trouble raising money if they wanted it.",1325995420

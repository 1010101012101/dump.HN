I thoroughly enjoy Haskell and Erlang, but I'm not sure they are languages anyone ""should know"".  My list would be more like (pick one from each):<p>1. C<p>2. Python, perl, or ruby<p>3. Matlab or R<p>4. Common Lisp or Scheme<p>5. A fifth sufficiently different language, but with worthy concepts: Erlang, Haskell, O'caml, Prolog, Lua, Javascript, etc...<p>The choices in the first 4 don't matter too terribly much and the selection of a single language from #5 would largely be based on your own personal interests.",1209340491

Or is it all hobbyists?<p>I'm coming from a C# background but for a while now my love was with functional programming and particularly Lisp. C# / SharePoint gigs earn good money, whereas Python seems to be less in demand and rather valued about as low as PHP, maybe a little higher. Maybe Ruby is closest to providing a ""healthy"" (for the programmer), strong-demand freelance market when wanting to work functional... any freelancers out there being able to work on projects they love, other than their own? My C# / SharePoint projects pay the bills but I increasingly loathe them. I don't want to get trapped in the ""deferred life plan"" where I get to do what I love only nights and weekends and do things I don't really like doing any more for a living.<p>Maybe it's unrelated to the actual technology and just the ""someone else's project"" that is the cause for the bad flavour of project work.

He's of English stock.<p>Whatever importance you might attach to these or other variables, the guy is <i>not</i> a representative African, and his circumstances can't be used to make claims about the whole.<p><i>Is that genetic? No. Fucking. Way. Implying that it is is the essence of racism.</i><p>Eh. Lots of things are genetic, including the composition of the brain.

175112,comment,172915,173331,0,0,zealog,,,"I think this is an excellent point and really gets into what David was talking about in his (absolutely inspiring) Startup School presentation and how it relates to this post.<p>To many people, being in a startup is about selling the same thing to the same people - eyeballs to VCs or Google.  That's it.  There frequently isn't a lot of concern over what exactly it is that draws them there.  In these situations, long hours are required (or at least mandated) because the target moves so frequently because someone has a ""better idea"" or needs to implement ""just this one thing"" to appease some VC who ends up not funding you anyway.  This lack of focus and constraints leads to middle of the road products that can only be worked on by people working 14 hour days to adapt to the ongoing changes.<p>It's sort of like when Hollywood is out to make a ""blockbuster."" They buy a popular comic book character, get a dozen hack writers to work on it - even while the scenes are being shot - and they put in a bunch of crap special effects.  Sure, sometimes it works, but most of the time it's a bunch of dreck that will never make back its $200 million budget.  Contrast that to the lifestyle business - er, independent film - being written and directed by the guy who LOVES what he's doing and making it for himself and you get Pulp Fiction.<p>Me, I'd much rather make ""Pulp Fiction"" than ""Daredevil.""",1209337746

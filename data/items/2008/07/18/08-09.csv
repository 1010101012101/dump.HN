249553,comment,249362,249362,0,0,m0nty,,,"Hmmm, let's leave global warming aside for a few moments and consider the other reasons to stop polluting:<p>* We're running out of oil.<p>* Oil costs too much.<p>* The oil we do have comes from unstable parts of the world with political regimes we might prefer to avoid providing money to.<p>* We face increased competition for fuel from developing nations like India and China.<p>* There are other environmental effects of pollution in addition to global warming.<p>* Our current reliance on ""dirty fuels"" is (quite probably) leading to an increase in respiratory diseases like asthma in developed countries.<p>* Our activities in general are leading to species and habitat loss at an unprecedented rate -- effectively, we are an extinction event.<p>I think too many ""global warming sceptics"" are motivated either by a desire to carry on as normal, or (as Homer Simpson put it) not letting ""the environmentalists win"". But clearly, we need to find alternative energy sources regardless of global warming, and we need to do it now.",1216370215

In theory, you have more time now than later, when you might need a real job, to start a business.<p>Don't drop out until you have an income from your new business.  If you are truly passionate about starting something, and it's obsessing you, you shouldn't need to 'drop out' to get it going.<p>And even then, when you have INCOME from this endeavor, you'd just be taking a break.  It's insurance, really.  A degree, however not worth it's weight in paper, will open doors for you.<p>But so would a hit startup.  You could have the next facebook in you.  So make it happen, but try, as long as you can, to hold on to the most unique time in your life, the experience of undergrad.<p>Cherish it and respect it.  Leave it when your new venture makes it so clear it's no longer a question you would ask a group.<p>Leave it when it's obvious.",1216369985

And the typical WTF, 'funny pics' and youtube crap that ruins other sites is isolated on <a href=""http://idle.slashdot.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://idle.slashdot.org/</a> where it can harm no-one.\nI think it starts with comment moderation ( <a href=""http://slashdot.org/moderation.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slashdot.org/moderation.shtml</a> ). It's hard to get karma on /. by just fooling around, and you have to be a dedicated user to even get to moderate other comments.\nContrary to digg where a sensible comment about X can be downmodded into oblivion by an army of 13 year old fanboys.",1216368430

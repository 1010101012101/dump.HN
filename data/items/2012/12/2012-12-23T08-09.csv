4959006,comment,4957864,4958318,7,0,konstruktor,,,"I think the problem with laws like the one you mentioned is that they aren't perceived as a threat because of selective enforcement. Assuming your posting reflects the legal situation correctly, many people who consider themselves law abiding citizens have committed a felony, but it is only enforced on, say, the guy who gets into an argument with a cop at a traffic stop and then has his vehicle searched.<p>While that is much worse than a law that can and will be enforced broadly, people will paradoxically seem to perceive it as <i>less</i> of a threat. The problem is that there are many such laws, which accumulate into a weapon the authorities have against you. You may be accused of something totally absurd (putting up a light installation in public), but instead of having to back down after discovering you aren't a terrorist, the authorities will find a law that will allow them to hold you responsible for their excessive reaction, or at least ""punish"" you for them embarrassing themselves.<p>This is why I think society would, to some degree, benefit from radical transparency. If all crimes were punished, people would be much more motivated to actually fight unjust, overly broad or unspecific laws, because everybody knows that they <i>will</i> be affected.<p>Personally, I have made a conscious decision to go out of my way to preserve my ability to start every unwanted encounter with a cop by asking him for the reason he stopped me and for his badge number (a right I have in my country), even though that may not be what I would actually do. However, that means that I cannot so some things I consider OK but aren't legal. But then, I live in a country with reasonably simple and understandable laws, even for a layperson.",1356252830

South Africa only has one phone company, Telkom.<p>The price of copper affects the quality of the telephone lines. We live in an area that's quickly growing, but the availability of copper is low. So there's shared telephone lines, which creates noise, which slows down modem connections.<p>Yeah, they can string out more copper cables to work through the shared lines, but when those copper cables disappear as quickly as they are put up, it is very difficult to make progress. Copper theft in South Africa is big.<p>And the shared telephone lines are deemed acceptable because Telkom support it only for telephone calls, not modem connections. They are reluctant to fix things that are not broken.<p>So landlines are effectively useless in fast growing areas, there's not enough copper cable to go around to give people a decent clear line to a dial-up ISP, let alone broadband.<p>I've moved my parents over to mobile broadband now, with a Mifi device that appeared on the market last year, so those download speeds are hopefully a thing of the past.<p>Essentially, developing countries need to skip their subpar landlines and invest heavily in mobile broadband abilities.

Basically, I created a new SSID and used Linux's traffic control/queueing discipline stuff to limit that SSID's outbound throughput to 32 kbps, limit inbound throughput to 64 kbps, add 900 milliseconds of latency on sent and received packets, and randomly drop 4% of packets in/out.  Very, <i>very</i> few sites were even remotely usable.  It was astonishing.<p>I think one of the most useful products that could ever be created for web developers is a ""world Internet simulator"" box that sits between your computer and its Internet connection.  (Maybe it plugs into your existing wireless router and creates a new wireless network.)  It would have a web interface that shows you a map of the world.  You click a country, and the simulator performs rate shaping, latency insertion, and packet loss matching the averages for whatever country you clicked.  Then devs can feel the pain of people accessing their websites from other countries.<p>(Thinking about this for a minute, it could probably be done for about $30 using one of those tiny 802.11n travel routers and a custom OpenWRT build.

My travel agent can always find me cheaper international tickets than what I could find on the internet.<p>Funny, I've always had the opposite experience: every time I've used a travel agent, they always found more expensive flights with worse timings (time of day, layover, etc), and I end up requesting specific flights based on what I've found online.",1356250077

New hardware and fast connections are the most expensive part of computing. Old (or very low cost) hardware doesn't run up-to-date software.

The actual broadband penetration is also low - 2% for fixed line, and 11% for mobile access. The mobile broadband (3g) is metered per mb and frequently drops down to edge. It is improving, but as with the rest of the developing world, if you want to actually target most users you need to use SMS or very basic html sites that can work on older S40 Nokia phones and blackberries.<p>Obviously a fancy desktop sized page that relies on java script is just completely out.",1356249841

In my experience of the big firms law firms have already developed very clean convertible notes, and there are many that are public, leading to a larger trend in easy terms. By having an entrepreneur friendly first investor (not necessarily lead) agreeing to ""clean terms"" (independent of valuation), it seems most other investors in a round come on with little friction, even if it might require a call from one of your existing investors/ commitments.",1356249601

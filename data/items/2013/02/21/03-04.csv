One can respect the environment and animals without smashing heads.

5255264,comment,5255061,5255061,8,0,lowglow,,,"My obsession with phone phreaking in the 90s was because it was the medium by which we accessed the world. There was a wire that ran into my house whereby I could speak to anyone or dial into anywhere. It was attached to a phone that itself could be taken apart and investigated.<p>Couple these facts with what was then the only resource for people wanting to know more for free: text files. The community surrounding 2600, Phrack, and countless other zines lost to the ages. It created a sense of ability to access all points along this route of communication.<p>I was young and stupid, and I wanted to know more about the technology behind what I was using. The presentation of text files help me consume that information easily, because they were in essence written by people like me for me.<p>When dial up faded out, and I grew older, technology was just a utility to make a paycheck. I shifted more focus on development, because phreaking/hacking didn't pay my bills. I think that generation just grew up and got cellphones. Then there was a cellphone phreaking period. It's still there but I feel the scene has gone far more underground, or concentrated its efforts on jail breaking.<p>I think we'll see a resurgence of hacking/phreaking soon, since devices are becoming cheaper and more accessible to children.",1361418856

5255257,comment,5253747,5255164,7,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"But his point, which I do want to reiterate, is that the vast majority of software engineers don't have that kind of saving/investing power.  Sure, you might earn $80k/year out of college, but then you pay 1/3 of your income in taxes and another 20% in rent on a one-bedroom apartment and pretty soon you find you've got about $3300/month to pay all your bills, buy food, make student-loan payments, and basically live your life.  In my experience, it came to a total saving power of a little less than half what you described.<p>Now admittedly, $20k/year is a hell of a lot to be able to save for normal Americans!  But at the end of five years it leaves you with $100k of savings, not $250k.  In the Boston area where I was, you couldn't even put a down-payment on a house with that little money.  It was basically just lots and lots of beer money.<p>On the other hand, if you know a magical company in a magical land, perhaps adorned with pastel ponies, at which I can make enough money with a low enough cost of living to retire after five or ten years to become a self-funded gentleman scientist, I'll certainly take that over graduate school.

Back when I would lurk, there were a lot of novel things going on, e.g. with VOIP. spoofing caller ID and calling yourself to extract the telco's caller ID data was one I remember. War-dialing and collecting interesting numbers was also big.<p>Obviously there is a nostalgia for the blue-boxing days, which most of us have only ever read about.

So those ten years averaged 7.9 per year; the seven years after averaged five per year. It's a nearly 60% increase per year.<p>In my opinion digital PC game sales would do nothing but tip the scale toward my point about the PC gaming market consolidating into just a few mega hit franchises that generate all the sales while the volume of games has significantly contracted. In PC gaming there are maybe ten titles that matter, such as WoW or Sims. In console gaming, there are over 100 titles a year that sell 1 million or more copies.<p>Free to play PC gaming is a very small market still. The Sims 2 alone made more money than the entire free-to-play market combined did in the previous four years. That may change in the next few years, but it doesn't change the facts that exist right now.<p>Four of the top five on that list are from 2004 or earlier. Meanwhile of course total console game sales have exploded to the moon during that time.<p>First of all, would you mind showing me the sales data from Steam? No? Then how do you intend to use that as part of your argument exactly?<p>Which game on steam has sold 11 million copies on the service, like Starcraft did at retail? 20 million like Sims 2? 9 million like Half-life 1? 12 million like Half-life 2? I'd wager it's not even remotely close.<p>It's my opinion that Steam is moving a mid number of high priced new releases, and a lot more lower priced discounted games (eg buying Shogun for $9.99 or Torchlight 2 for $9.99 during discounts). A quick look through their top 50 best selling reveals the strong majority are $20 or less, with many being $11.99 or less. Is Steam popular? Of course, but what does that have to do with whether the PC gaming market has consolidated into a few hit franchises with less total games produced per year?",1361418211

They, like all startups, are desperate for talent so they recruit like mad. But it's important to them not only to get folks with engineering chops, but that they get folks who will fit in with their culture. In fact, one time they reject someone because he said that he liked to play hoops and they thought that was a funny way to say basketball.[1]<p>Fast forward to another tech boom. We've got another company, vaguely similar to the first, but this time they want to make it easier for websites to accept credit card based payments. They also recruit like mad and care a lot about culture. In fact they have something called a Sunday Test: ""if this person were alone in the office on a Sunday would that make you more likely to come in and want to work with them?"" It's a bit less clear what that means in this case, but it certainly sounds like they are optimizing for homogeneity.[2]<p>Those two stories are both about culture. They're both about companies working hard to define their own internal culture in a way that they think will make them more successful. Further I think that, in many ways, that they are right about this guess! Monocultures are very very useful in small early stage startups!<p>But aren't the effects of this kind of fucked up? Shouldn't we at least acknowledge the fact that not making a job offer to a guy because he used the word ""hoops"" is a little weird? And this doesn't even get into related issues of race or gender or class backgrounds.<p>Much of Shanley's post is about this sort of thing. She's not saying that meetings are great, or flat hierarchies are bad or that free lunches are bullshit. But she is saying that these things aren't 100% good. They come with some significant downsides that are rarely acknowledge inside of the ""everything we do is awesome"" startup bubble.<p>I don't think she is imputing ill will (well mostly, she is a bit). Rather she's just trying to throw some water in the face of a very self satisfied startup culture. She's saying ""look around you guys! Some of these values that you think are 100% awesome have some big downsides!"" And I think that is very laudable.<p>Apparently some of her rhetoric was a bit off the mark as some people are dismissing her post as bitter.

People do things that they didn't do before because of maps. The moon shot, while an event in itself, yes, didn't in itself change the way people relate and interact.<p>Also, I was far more wowed when I first saw street view than when I first saw JFK's assassination. Prominent politicians have been assasssinated at least as far back as Julius Caesar, but showing me a picture of just about any street location in the developed world? That's something new, interesting, ambitious, and yes, even life-changing.

That certainly negatively impacts them if they desire that compatibility, we just haven't chosen to make that negative impact illegal/punishable in most cases.<p>>When they do, we do get calls to ""enforce"" the rules, e.g. in the context of net neutrality.<p>Network neutrality is probably a bad example of ""internet"" regulation because despite the name it's really telecommunications regulation, which is a very different animal. The need for network neutrality comes from the existence of other telecommunications regulations: If (hypothetically) Uncle Sam didn't exclusively license the wireless spectrum or provide only select companies with massive subsidies and access to eminent domain to lay cable then there would be no call for network neutrality, but once the government steps in to establish a monopoly or cartel it then has to limit its power.<p>I would think the better example of your point would be Microsoft being hit with antitrust for breaking compatibility with Java in breach of the license.",1361416460

But you're not given the leeway to focus ""exclusively"" on a single research contribution in a focused manner in other higher-paying options.<p>Even if you're not taking out a loan in the monetary sense, you're taking out a loan from your long term earnings, one that has little chance of being repaid, to put your mental assets/skills to a non-remunerable task, and get a certification that you did so.  The problem is that the option to continue doing this (tenure-track academic jobs) are limited and (naturally) highly contested.<p>However, you make a good point--there's an underlying and insidious opportunity cost that is often unknowingly sacrificed: that of atrophying skill sets.  It's easy for a PhD to be a hugely insular experience, if you let it, and if you take the easy way out and don't stretch your engineering skills (speaking in terms of CS here, since that's what I know),  you're in for a rude awakening if you determine that academia is not for you.  If you're not careful, you'll get good at writing papers, but might actually get /worse/ at writing portable, readable, and maintainable code.  And as brilliant as your papers may be, if you can't ship good code, you're going to have trouble in industry.<p>The good thing, again at least for CS students like me, is that the ""fun and enriching"" environment of academia means a lot of opportunity for starting companies, creating libraries/frameworks, working on side projects, and doing contract work, so there's no reason you have to atrophy.

When I read\nprovocative prose with words like 'lies' and 'nuevo-social' and '1%\nposter children' I see snark. And in this case 'I got no pony!'[1] level\nof snark. Thus I read the posting with the impression that the author\nhad suffered a strong emotional blow and was venting. With that much\nhurt (perceived) I gave them slack for their otherwise very sloppy\nreasoning.<p>Our author asserts, <i>""Culture is about power dynamics, unspoken\npriorities and beliefs, mythologies, conflicts, enforcement of social\nnorms, creation of in/out groups and distribution of wealth and\ncontrol inside companies.""</i> which is a highly arguable statement. I\nwould posit that culture is about creating a structure to both set\nexpectations and define success in an environment. Nothing about power\nover you or creating ""in"" or ""out"" groups or wealth or any of the\nthings our author asserts. Our author further asserts that <i>""Culture\nis exceedingly difficult to talk about honestly.""</i> which is also\nnot true, they are attempting to be ""honest"" here in spite of their\nown declaration.<p>As the topical 'setup' for what is an emotional rant, the entire\nposition statement in the first five paragraphs says exactly one thing\n""I (the author) am mad that I am unable to understand (or possibly to\naccept) what people are asking of me with regards to my behavior\naround others.""<p>What follows then are a series of ""sound bytes"" pulled out as\nsub-heads with the author's flawed understanding of what they mean.\nThe author has gone out of their way at times to attribute a level of\ndeceit and malice to others that borders on paranoid but let's stick\nwith what they wrote and go over it shall we?<p>On the sound bite ""We make sure to hire people who are a cultural fit""\nthe author claims the intent is <i>"" ... We have implemented a loosely\ncoordinated social policy to ensure homogeneity in our workforce. We\nare able to reject qualified, diverse candidates on the grounds that\nthey aren't a culture fit. while not having to examine what that\nmeans ...""</i><p>That reads very much like they (or someone they knew) considered\nthemselves ""qualified"" and yet their application for employment\nwas ""rejected as a poor cultural fit."" It seems they have taken\nthe path that it is simpler to blame this on some malicious prep\nschool like club when, on closer inspection it never is. The fact is\nthat startups are desperate for qualified talent, that is what makes\nthem go, however if the way in which a candidate comports themselves\nsuggests they will cause friction with people who are already hired\nthen, even if they are qualified, hiring them would be a bad decision\nif it increased problems at work.<p>Let's used a contrived example, lets say that three guys decide to\nstart a company and they have always had a rich tradition of\ncommenting their code. In fact they often exchange ideas in comments\nas they check things into a source repository. They find that this\ntransparency in the thought process allows them to evolve the code\nbased faster in a compatible way. Now, when interviewing to employee\n#1 (or #10 doesn't really matter) they ask about writing comments in\ncode and the candidate replies :  ""Writing comments in code\njust slows me down, anyone to stupid to not be able to see what the\ncode does shouldn't be reading my code."" They may stop right there and\nsay, ""Thanks, but your not a cultural fit for company.""<p>Nothing about power, nothing about secret societies, just a knowledge\nthat working with this candidate won't ""flow"" because they depend on\nthat dialog in comments and this candidate is unwilling to write\ncomments. It's the founder's company, and this is a classic case of\nfind people who are ""a cultural fit.""<p>Sound byte number two is ""Meetings are evil and we have them as little\nas possible."" which our author conveniently translates to <i>""We have a\ncollective post-traumatic stress reaction to previous workplaces that\nhad hostile, unnecessary, unproductive and authoritarian meetings.""</i><p>One asks (and I did) ""Where did that come from?"" And I answered myself\nwith ""I wonder if this person doesn't have any tools for keeping in touch\nwith what is going on, and so a lack of meetings threatens them.""\nBecause keeping in touch as a developer is as straight forward as\nreading the commit log and talking to people. Now from a strategy,\nvision, mission perspective? Sure you want someone to let you know\nwhere you are heading, but most engineers hate a weekly status\nmeetings that don't provide any value. So it seems our author has\nagain projected their own mis-understanding into some malicious\ndeceit.<p>One which stuck right out was the response to ""We don't have a\nvacation policy."" The authors interpretation of this is <i>""We fool\nourselves into thinking we have a better work/life balance when really\npeople take even less vacation than they would when they had a\nvacation policy.""</i><p>It would have helped had the author suggested what they interpret that\nto imply (wow that is a lot of indefinits!) but they chose not to so\nwe have to speculate. Immature individuals will interpret a 'no\nvacation policy' to mean they can take vacation whenever, and for as\nlong as, they want. A more reasoned interpretation is that folks can\ncount on taking some time off to rest and recover <i>once their product\nships.</i> A 'no explicit policy' does <i>not</i> mean that folks don't care\nhow much you produce, rather it has always meant that you take time\noff to keep your productivity high when you are at work. Some people\ncannot handle that level of responsibility, either through lack of\nmaturity or through mixed expectations. It isn't the culture that is\nevil though. Its like teachers who don't grade the homework, they\nstill expect you to do it so that you have satisfied <i>yourself</i> that\nyou understand the material. It doesn't mean ""woo hoo we don't have to\ndo the homework!""<p>Every single 'culture' point our author attacks they do so in a way\nthe imputes some amazing ill will on the person espousing the point.<p>The most charitable interpretation I could come up with was that this\nperson was feeling hurt, I accept that it is possible they are simply\nquite immature, or unable to internalize the concept of a culture\nmodel based on peer respect rather than explicit rules. I don't know\nif they read HN but on the off chance they did, I was trying to\nexpress, compassionately, that people aren't trying to deceive you\nwith this discussion of culture, they are trying to communicate. Once\nyou understand what they are saying you will understand better whether\nor not you want to work with them. I guess I failed at that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://i-want-a-pony.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i-want-a-pony.com/</a>",1361416128

Ones that do support SACDs still no longer support digital surround output.<p>I love my PS3, but Sony seems to have quite a history of over-promising and under-delivering with these announcements, and then cutting features that they launched with down the line as well.",1361415942

For example, agencies you trust could publish such lists. You could pick three such lists and only trust organizations that appear on two of them.<p>And if you betray that trust, it will nearly always be easily detectable in an automated way. At that point, everyone will stop trusting you and you'll be back at zero. By contrast, if you accumulate 51% of the mining power, there's no easy way for people to take that away from you and make you start over.",1361415746

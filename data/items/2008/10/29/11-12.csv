He's gone to far greater lengths to help this guy than most folks would in such a situation.<p>I'll point out that this sounds very much like Matt suffers from schizophrenia.  I know this illness well as someone very close to me suffers from it, and when unmedicated behaves pretty much exactly like that.  That's not to say the situation is any less dangerous, but probably not because someone is going to kill Matt--more likely because he'll get himself into dangerous situations because of his dramatic misinterpretation of events.  Schizophrenics without friends and family to help keep them out of trouble, and medicated as necessary, often wind up in prison.<p>If my from afar diagnosis has any basis in reality (which it very well may not--I'm not a psychiatrist, and I only know what the website told me), the fact that Zed posted all of this information will very likely be taken as a sign that Zed, formerly a ""friend"" worthy of trust in a dangerous situation, is now Matt's enemy.  Family and lifelong friends are not immune to this effect, so I'm certain a random stranger who wrote some nifty software won't be.  Anything said or done that doesn't match precisely the worldview of a schizophrenic is viewed with suspicion, and very often the worldview changes from minute to minute as the mind flits from one misinterpretation to the next.  This may explain why Zed can't get in touch with him: Zed is obviously part of the conspiracy, and his trying to call him frequently merely confirms it (there is no ""right"" action here; Zed certainly hasn't done anything wrong, it's just the way things go in the mind of a schizophrenic).",1225280413

347341,comment,347296,347296,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Commodore BASIC actually was my first experience with a scripting language (and my first experience doing any programming at all a few years before).<p>When I was about 12, or thereabouts, I operated a BBS that ran the Color 64 BBS software, which was an assembly core with BASIC scripting.  The assembly core made it just fast enough to serve out to a 2400 baud modem, and the BASIC scriptability made it really easy to add new games and features, and without having to restart the whole system (BASIC with line numbers allows overwriting of lines by using the same number...so, it's like a LISP machine...if you squint really hard, and hit yourself in the head a few times).  The fact that a program could be <i>both</i> BASIC and assembly was something altogether novel to me.  Of course, now I know that UNIX guys had been doing it for years, but at the time I'd only ever seen programs written entirely in assembly or entirely in BASIC.  Never one that was a seamless combination of the two.<p>I still have the Color 64 manual and floppy disk.  It was hand-bound and printed on a dot matrix printer.  I could never bring myself to get rid of it, in the numerous cleanings over the past 20 years.  And I think the reason is that it taught me something that has stuck with me all these years (that one should use the right tool for the job--not necessarily the one that is ""fastest"" or most popular or the same as everything else in the toolchain).<p>Now that I think of it, I'm wondering if it actually extended the BASIC syntax (making BASIC a DSL for BBS software, of sorts), or if it just did the networking in assembly and rerouted standard IO from BASIC to the modem.  If the former, I think I owe some more props to the author of Color 64 (above and beyond the $50 I paid for the software 20 years ago...though that <i>was</i> when $50 meant something...it'd be like six grand in today's dollars).",1225279544

Take a look. <p>Facebook is clearly Italy. \nMyspace vaguely China. \nWoW and Second Life definetely Australia, New Zealand. \nThe Icy North is a very widened North America, (AOL Texas), (Yahoo Games, Florida)\nDigg is DEFINITELY a dog with Fark as its head.<p>\n",1178139599
18832,comment,18590,18590,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Everyone keeps talking about infringing copyright, but isn't this code just used to be able to play DVDs?  Isn't this the code that is built into every HD-DVD player so that it can decrypt and playback DVDs?  By posting the code, Linux users are now allowed to view HD-DVDs that they have legitimately purchased.  This has nothing to do with copying.<p>The whole problem with DRM is the basic assumption that every user is a potential thief.  The real problem is that it's often more convenient (not only for monetary reasons) to get a copy than to buy the actual material.  As soon as someone has to go out and buy new computer hardware to be able to play a legally-purchased DVD on their Windows Vista install, just because of DRM, then that convenience is gone.<p>DRM, especially in its current implementation, doesn't work.  Digg users were trying to do something to finally end the craziness surrounding it.",1178139448

This is not required in most cases. Writing custom components from scratch is the best option[making Flash IDE your primary choice].Flex should be a secondary option.<p>[Flex was created to make Flash Platform more accessible to Java developers who are not familiar with the timeline concept]",1178137270

This is a piece of information  that is a part of every single HD-DVD player and every single HD-DVD disc.  It is the nature of people to be curious, and to share their findings with their peers and to the world.  This is how science and technology have advanced for centuries.  Censorship strikes at core American values, which are based on more fundamental observations of human nature that apply to everyone in the world.  <p>Furthermore ""Stealing"" is one of the worst possible words to use.  Duplicating and distributing media is not stealing.  The term Copyright Infringement and it's important not to conflate the two.  In some cases, Copyright Infringement is a far more expensive than stealing, but they are not the same thing.  Whenever something is stolen, there is -always- an identifiable victim, no matter how minor the victimization might be.  There is always someone who has lost something.  In the case of copying an HD-DVD, there is no such automatic loss.  <p>Stealing someone's copyright is stealing.  Plagiarism is stealing.  Breaking an exclusive license agreement is not.",1178137200

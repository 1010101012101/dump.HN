There is only the individual mind. Apple is the product of the mind of one individual, Steve Jobs. It is not the product of a committee. The greatest innovations seem to arise from individuals, not ""group-think"". Hopefully Mr. Jobs returns to Apple. But if not, Apple needs to try and find another creative innovator like Mr. Jobs, somebody who can think outside the box, somebody who beyond computer science and business, is also and ultimately an artist.<p>It is the Howard Roarkes and Steve Jobs of the world that drive the economy. Were Ms. Rand around today, she would surely see Mr. Jobs as a Howard Roarke of today. For the sake of Apple's shareholders, I hope they can find somebody else similar in the event that Mr. Jobs cannot return.",1235663903

Here's my take (warning, probably won't be that new / insightful):<p>Good:<p>* Excellent for traveling. I have a 2GB SD card and more books then I'll ever read on any single trip.<p>* Fairly straightforward to convert into Kindle format. About half of the books I read are from Project Gutenberg and therefore free :)<p>* Book/Magazine purchasing is fast and efficient (instant gratification is nice)<p>* Battery Life: Not as amazing as people say it is, but still quite impressive<p>* Text resizing: Reading at the Gym / on a bus is much easier when you can bump up the font size<p>* Carrying case: Leather, makes it look like a moleskine<p>Meh:<p>* Internet access: Nice, although the screen refresh is slow enough to make it a little painful<p>* Audio support: Never tried it, so can't say<p>* Page turn speed: Takes a little to get used to, but then it's fine and doesn't really interrupt reading<p>* UI: A little counterintuitive at first, but easy to adjust to. Occasionally slow, and you do accidentally press buttons a bit<p>* Price: The device is expensive, and occasionally books are more than you might want to pay (I'm used to the library :) ).<p>Bad:<p>* Selection is wanting. There are many books that aren't available.<p>* Graphics: Illustrations don't translate well to 4 colors. This rules out a bunch of books<p>* My first kindle died within the first month, it was a pain to replace, but at least done for free<p>* Really bad for skimming / flipping through pages quickly.",1235663750

They're winners, because they get to do something they couldn't before.<p>Dan Lyons went from being one of my favorite bloggers to being one of my least favorites at a sickening pace. He's smarmy, overgeneralizes, and generally a prick overall. It was great when he was Fake Steve, because part of the joke was that he was so unlikable, but now he's just Dan Lyons, writer at one of the magazines that's quickest going into decline.<p>Hulu is using an old ad scheme. Online, a new system <i>will</i> have to be developed, because right now things aren't as profitable. That doesn't make YouTube a failure, though, considering it's managing to break even despite being enormous. (Also note that each visitor to YouTube is likely watching <i>far</i> more videos a month than the average Hulu user is watching on Hulu.)<p>The moral of Hulu is that beautiful, efficient web sites are a good thing, and that even companies can make them. There is no moral here about old media versus new media. Youtube is still enormous compared to Hulu, because people like having the ability to constantly post videos. Furthermore: Hulu <i>is</i> new media. If it succeeds, it does so because people prefer it to TV. The fact that the content is the same doesn't change that Hulu allows instant access to a wide library for free, that it allows rating and comments and embedding. That's new media, not old.<p>The best part is that Hulu's parent companies <i>don't</i> get it. They're trying to restrict Hulu, rather than give it freedom. Old media is the largest thing holding parts of Hulu back.<p>The sad part is that if it weren't for blogging and new media, Dan Lyons wouldn't be working for Newsweek. At Forbes he was a nobody: he only became famous after his blog kicked off. It's sad partly because Lyons is good at playing a blowhard because he <i>is</i> a blowhard.

495914,comment,495188,495188,0,0,nihilocrat,,,"Here are some tips that are more relevant for the semi-recent job market (I graduated in 2007):<p>1. If you aren't doing an internship or working a job that's related to your field (like doing systems administration / development for the college or a local company), you are behind, even if you are on the Dean's List. These days, employers seem to be able to find enough people who have done something parallel to their education, so if you don't you will look just as inexperienced as if you had no degree at all. The bar got raised and it's possible no one has told you.<p>2. I am probably biased towards the job market in my area, but hardly anyone wants entry level, and as I said above, no one wants ""ground level"" (just a degree) unless you are gunning for a helpdesk / PC tech position. I figure this is because the hiring pool of experienced IT workers is large enough and their quality versus fresh recruits better enough that they feel they don't need to look for junior staff that they plan on training.<p>3. As others have said, you will only really use a small set of the skills you learned in school. Work will remind you more of your job / internship / side projects you had during college. This is probably why employers scoff at degree-only graduates.<p>4. All of this advice is of course just my personal experience, and many employers probably have different beliefs.",1235661875

I was looking, and failed to find information on the net on what kind of effect coding in prefix notation has on the way you think, compared to infix notation.<p>I know that after a few months of toying with arc, the prefix notation seems to be clearer to my mind than similar code in infix (I still code in ruby at work), but finding anything concrete on the net about the effect of coding in prefix is tricky. I mainly run into blog-posts expressing a similar feeling.<p><pre><code>  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir-Whorf_hypothesis\n  http://www.frozenreality.co.uk/comic/bunny/index.php?id=919</code></pre>",1221389866

303691,comment,303605,303605,0,0,halo,,,"This sort of post is one of the great failures in social news sites. 7 upvotes, 13th on the front page, zero interesting content. The cause is the plague of feel-good ""me too""-ism, groupthink and lowest-common-denominator-ism that causes people to upvote things uncritically and eventually leads to the mass-upvoting of poor articles and comments (especially the immortal ""[pic]"", agreeable question/'vote up if' or 'hilarious' YouTube video) over good more thought-provoking, challenging and nuanced ones. I think it's a big flaw in the concept of social news sites ala Hacker News, Reddit and Digg.<p>Relevant to the topic, I've been moving towards MetaFilter lately as it doesn't suffer from this problem as much due to the design of the site, has the bonus of hand-moderation and the $5 entrance fee is a surprisingly good way of limiting membership. The flip side of this is that the content is a very mixed bag in terms of submission quality and topic due to the hugely different styles and interests of submitters - even more so than other social news sites. The comments there are often unparalleled in terms of quality, however, and Ask MeFi is an invaluable resource.<p>I poked around with Planets (blog aggregators on one topic) for a while but the amount of content is generally overbearing to make it impractical to read them for any great length of time.<p>I'm slowly but surely warming to the idea that old-style blogs that link to the other content may be a good idea but the question is finding a good ones that are regularly updated, whose moderation you can trust and whose interests align with yours. I do read Boing Boing, Ajaxian and Engadget who follow this format, but I think Slashdot has suffered from it over time by deviating from its core subject matter, has become a caricature of itself especially with regards to its biases and suffered from dumbing down over time. Of course, it's still an open problem as to where they get their content from and how they filter the good from the bad.<p>Perhaps the conclusion is that the whole concept of a link-driven news site is still largely an open problem - and I'm certainly not sure what the solution is.",1221388693

In the URI standard [1], a URI has a `path` which is made up of segments. Each `segment` is a set of pchars delimited by by ""/"". The `pchar` character class includes the `unreserved` character class which contains the `mark` character class which contains both ""("" and "")"".<p>That said, I'd argue that ""("" and "")"" should never have been allowed because of the tendency for people to mention web sites like this (news.ycombinator.com). I'd also argue that trailing punctuation should be ignored for cases like this news.ycombinator.com.<p>But oh well, it is too late now.

I doubt it could be as high as 68% though.<p>More significantly, what someone looks like should probably be outclassed by other factors. There's no real measure of competence except competence. Looks are just noise.

303680,comment,303605,303650,0,0,13ren,,,"I use both HN and progit (programming subreddit); though HN < progit for technical programming articles.<p>However, the big plus of HN is the 100% absence of trolls (or maybe I just don't notice them here because they aren't encouraged). The most horrible thing on reddit is several people with technical competence who use it to abuse people - a form of trolling. I find that combination hard work to deal with.<p>I wonder if a factor is not ""diluting responsibility"" (psych 101) too much? HN is a smaller site (and has pg overseeing it); subreddits have fewer subscribers; /. has fewer (randomly chosen) moderators.  Is too much dilution of responsibility what undermines social sites like Digg?",1221386835

And even though I know ideas don't cost a thing, I still think it's important to choose the best one and I can't be as motivated by just developing process. I want to see a real way to make money with the idea.<p>So, secrecy is not an issue with me now. And, anyway, I'm in Russia and even if you decide to implement something similar I could always concentrate on the local market.<p>To make this valuable not just to me, I would like to ask everyone who has an idea that needs to be assessed more or less objective, to post it here. Mine will be in the first comment.",1232377194

Now I got a promotion, but not much of a pay raise so I could be making even more.  But, I am surrounded by smart people, it's low stress, I work 40 hours a week, and I spend 90% of my time developing so it's nice.",1232377150

440478,comment,440239,440418,0,0,dfox,,,"Reasoning behind trigraphs (partially explained in footnote in standard, section 5.2.1.1) is that there is something like ""Invariant Code Set"" which is subset of ASCII and some characters used by C does not fall into this set (which is obvious since C uses all ASCII characters except @ and $, with $ being valid character for identifiers on some compilers). Real usefulness of this feature is exactly zero, but it provides some insight into process of standardization. Uselessness of this is even more pronounced by fact that there is no trigraph sequence for _, which also does not exist in some encodings (althought for slightly different reasons).<p>Because almost all encodings that are not somehow compatible with ASCII are obsolete now, trigraphs are obsolete too. But it is certainly interesting thing to know about. And by the way ""incompatible with ASCII"" means that the characters are there, but look different (¤ vs. $, ¥ vs \,  and so on...)",1232377032

    the largest app platform ever. Apple’s FairPlay DRM is 
    proprietary but created the largest legal media 
    ecosystem to date. So while the power of proprietary 
    platforms to create large markets has been 
    demonstrated, the ability of open source to create 
    large and lucrative markets coherent enough to attract 
    commercial developers in the consumer markets is yet to 
    be proven.

    Ironically, if the iPhone platform can fail to dominate 
    the smartphone market because it’s too closed, the 
    Android platform may fail because it’s too open.</code></pre>",1232376682

It takes weeks or months before you can do anything actually useful (not just nerdy fun, like calculating pi or something.) That being said, how do you explain the difference between an array and a linked list to someone who only knows python? to take a trivial example. Sure, you could, but it's extremely unintuitive. Whereas with C you're so close to the hardware that the distinction is obvious.",1232373787

It didn't have my PIN, the number on the back, or my name on it, but it had my 16 digit number. That is something you can just create randomly, from the perspective of the customer there is absolutely nothing you can do to protect yourself from that. I guess they generate a bunch and test them somehow, but since the thief had a card that matched an account, he went out and tried about 9 stores in an hour. He was able to buy about $1200 in merchandise from 2 stores, the rest either rejected him or by that point the bank had declined my account.<p>The bank called me and told me all of this within 20 minutes of it happening. I saw the money debited from my account, my bank balance was lower, etc. They sent me 2 forms to sign saying it wasn't me, and within 24 hours the money was back in my account. Since then the bank has dealt with the merchants who took the fake card, filed a fraud report, etc. I spent less than 20 minutes dealing with this overall, it was not a big deal for me.<p>Contrast that with someone stealing $1200 from my safe or $1200 of my bitcoins. I'm just screwed then. I have no recourse, no one dealing with this stuff for me, etc.<p>While keeping your login information secure is a good thing, ultimately the banks are the ones keeping things secure. They have plenty of intelligent systems that know your typical buying habits, and you are quickly red flagged when some unusual purchases happen.<p>I know that transferring money out of my bank accounts over the internet at my bank REQUIRES a phone call and a piece of paper the first time. After that, sure, you can transfer instantly. But if someone installs a keylogger on my machine and transfer all the money from my checking account to my savings account or my investments, I don't really care. I'll just transfer it back. He will not be able to transfer it to his own bank account very easily, not unless he breaks the banks system. And as shown by the debit card incidident, when the bank's security fails the customer is not liable.",1308314523

Some actually see that as an advantage of using a schemaloose (yes I just made that up) storage like MongoDb. I don't need to have a whole document defined in order to test the functionality of an embeded object in that document. Yes, you're relying on the application alone to enforce the model, but that's a trade off made up front regardless.<p>As for modeling and the cost of refactoring, I think it depends on more than just the storage facility you're using. The code that handles your modeling in MongoDB is only as brittle or robust as you choose, same as a SQL solution. Yes, it helps if you think more up front about how you are going to query the data that you store using MongoDB as this will help to minimizing refactoring later on. However, I think the pain associated with moving part of a table to another / new table in SQL is no less painful than moving an embedded object or other data structure around in MongoDB.

Those areas have relatively few people compared to the more populous parts of China, though; Shanghai alone has more people than all of Xinjiang.

2665230,comment,2662617,2662617,65,0,jdietrich,,,"Once upon a time, I played poker for a living. The most important thing I learned was that the least important factor in how much I earned was my skill at poker. The most important skill was table selection, my decisions over which games to get involved in and who to sit next to. A close second was managing my resources, making sure I was playing within my financial and emotional means.<p>If you want to be world champion or mix it up with the legends in Bobby's Room, you need to be a phenomenal player, but being great at poker won't stop you from being broke and miserable. Everyone in poker knows a 'That Guy', a bona fide poker genius who keeps fucking their life up because they care too much about the game. The archetypal example is Stu Ungar; He won three world championships and over $30 million, but died aged 45, penniless and alone in a crappy motel because he just couldn't get his life in order.<p>Like poker, software is intrinsically meaningful only as an intellectual puzzle. It can be fascinating and beautiful and it can send you mad. Fall into the trap of believing that poker is a worthwhile pursuit of itself and you end up in the trap - living out of your car or on the crappy end of the Vegas strip, some weeks a millionaire, some weeks a bankrupt. You see them come and go, the bright-eyed but slowly dimming college dropouts who could be living the life of Riley if only they knew something outside of poker, if only they stopped trying to beat the hardest games for the sake of it.<p>Your usefulness as a developer is only indirectly related to your ability to code. There are bona fide geniuses working in poverty and obscurity, there are utterly mediocre programmers doing amazingly useful and important work. Github is overflowing with brilliant, painstaking solutions to problems that just don't matter. Your most important skill as a developer is choosing what to work on. It doesn't matter how lousy a programmer you are, you can still transform an industry by simple merit of being the first person to seriously write software for it. Don't spend good years of your life writing the next big social network or yet another bloody blogging engine. Don't be That Guy.",1308313357

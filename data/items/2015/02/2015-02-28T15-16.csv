Although I don&#x27;t get the impression that the current stuff doing that is prone to disastrous failures, and I believe the system has some slack here and there to reverse errors, i.e. transfers of money vs. buying and selling financial instruments.  The current infamous failure in this area, which was WRT to the latter, was at Knight Capital.<p>But above a certain level, at which point we&#x27;re not so much  &quot;playing with people&#x27;s life savings&quot; (or, rather, if they have a clue, only a small portion of them), the situation can be a lot more fluid.

9123989,comment,9123822,9123822,0,0,lisa_henderson,,,"For years I worked as a concierge programmer, and it was the most fun that I ever had, mostly because of the one-to-one relationship I had with my clients. All of them were in the same circumstance, which is that they had inherited a large amount of money, and they had an idea for a website. I was able to offer 2 different skills: my skill as a programmer, and my experience in the world of startups. In all such cases my clients were non-technical and inexperienced in the world of startups. They had no interest in being angel investors, instead they wanted to dive in and use their own creativity to find out how hard it was to build a business around software. They tended to be reasonably interesting people, and I enjoyed working with them, and I enjoyed shaping their vision into something that could exist in the real world. All of the projects eventually grew (for a time) into something larger, at which point I would help put together a team of what was needed (typically some mix of backenders, frontenders, QA, writers, and customer service support).<p>I did make good money during those years (2002 to 2009) but what I recall most fondly is how much fun all of it was.<p>I think that world has now largely died out, as even the earliest stage startups now belong to a scene that is somewhat professionalizing. But the earlier web was unprofessional, and that was the best thing about it.<p>Still I find, even now, even in New York City, there is some of the same energy among those dreaming about doing very early stage startups. Certainly the creativity and excitement is still there. The problem I&#x27;ve run into lately is the large number of people who are so sure that their idea will someday be worth billions that they do not want to pay cash right now, they only want to pay in equity. And that kills all of the fun for me.",1425139037

Right from the start, I knew that this is a really crowded space but I still decided to start building my app for two reasons -<p>1. I think the current help desk platforms (barring maybe Groove) are too complex and much more suited for bigger support teams. I thought that creating a simpler app (with less feature-bloat) specifically designed for smaller (1-5 people) support teams could be my app&#x27;s differentiating factor.<p>2. I wanted to move away from per user pricing and instead switch to a flat price of about $25 per month. Also, instead of a free plan, I thought of providing an open source (self-hosted) version.<p>I am quite happy with how the project is turing out, but there&#x27;s this nagging doubt that I might be better off making something where there&#x27;s less of a competition.

A lot of adware companies used to both buy their own distribution through either pay per install or revenue share agreements and then monetize those users themselves. Now, the ecosystem is fracturing into companies that actually perform the distribution and companies that monetize those users.<p>* Large distribution companies: 
- IronSource (this article)
- InstallMonetizer (YC funded as adwarekiller mentioned)

As you can see from the above list, there is also A LOT of VC money in the ecosystem.

Hangouts was supposed to progressively regroup all these messaging capabilities in one service, but the SMS integration alone has been so bad that Google rolled out a separate SMS app after deleting it in the first place (the new version is an improved Material revamp, but it still serves the same purpose).  
There is probably a very interesting insider story behind this cock-up.  
In the mean-time, I hope that Google will learn from these attempts and improve Hangouts in meaningful ways. Sundar Pinchai has already alluded to the fact that Hangouts and Photos are going to be treated as entirely different teams/services than Google+, which is probably a good start.",1425138769

9123972,comment,9120168,9120896,0,0,waps,,,"It&#x27;s much worse than that. You&#x27;ll erase everything, and likely won&#x27;t be able to hold on to the new skills unless the plasticity was temporary.<p>Brain plasticity evolves in very specific ways. Simplified you could say that a young brain learns &quot;short-term&quot; things. It learns things (and learns how to cause things) that last tens of microseconds at and just after birth, then over the years moves to seconds, minutes, hours and longer.<p>But circuits are massively redundant. Until you lose about 90% of the part of the brain that fulfils a certain function, you won&#x27;t notice a thing. Go over that, and ...<p>Every memory, every skill, everything in your brain is built on the basic premise that the shorter term neurocircuits work a certain way, that they have solidified. Every memory made when you were 10 years old is filtered through and interpreted by circuits established when you were 9. Memories made when you were 11, get filtered through the 10 year circuits, then the 9 year circuits, then ...<p>So if a neurocircuit changes that was built when you were 14 years EVERYTHING after that is gone. Every memory younger than when you were 14 years old gets filtered through the now-scrambled 14 year old circuits, which will transform it into noise, which the rest of the brain will promptly ignore.<p>This is why you regularly have demented people thinking they are much younger than they actually are, failing to remember they have kids, and so on. They suddenly start doing what they did at that age as well, leaving for work at 6am despite being pensioned for 30 years, in many cases to companies that have long since ceased to exist. Not recognizing kids (and especially grandkids). Note that this is usually emotionally very, very hard for those kids.<p>So if you successfully reset your brain to the plasticity it had when you were 14, every memory, every skill, every detail after that will disappear. The next day you will wake up, likely terrified, in a room you think you&#x27;ve never seen before, wondering where your mother is, not knowing what the hell a cell phone is. If there is damage that did not just do a one-time scramble of the circuit, but actually keeps it from re-solidifying, you will wake up like that every day of the rest of your life, not remembering the day before.<p>It also works in reverse : you can teach kids about long term effects (e.g. money) for months, and it just won&#x27;t stick. Don&#x27;t be fooled they&#x27;ll be able to repeat the lesson back to you, but they can&#x27;t apply knowledge that improves their long-term situation because it gets erased.",1425138719

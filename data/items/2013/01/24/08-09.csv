5108467,comment,5106682,5106682,2,0,ctoth,,,"I often have discussions with pro-gun friends of mine about reasonable solutions that would allow them to retain their weapons, which they evidently greatly favor, and would still increase overall safety.<p>It seems to me that the argument that a gun provides protection is a valid one. What other device gives us the ability to point and click and stop someone literally dead in their tracks?\nThis is the problem, and as I see it one that is asking for a technical solution. Consider a device with the following attributes:<p><pre><code>  - It is extremely quick to deploy. Just as quick as drawing and firing a gun.\n  - It can be used multiple times in succession\n  - It renders a potential threat (say a hostile person with a gun) inert or otherwise incapacitated\n  - It is affordable, $99 or less.\n  - It is difficult if not impossible to block (no Faraday cage armor)\n</code></pre>\nNow, how might this be done? Can we induce paralysis remotely without deactivating critical muscles like the heart? I know about TASERS (TM), and from what I understand the primary drawback with those is that they are only one-time use weapons, once deployed they aren't easily reusable (I.E. if you miss you're out of luck) and their range is not equivalent to a handgun. Can one of you smart hackers find a link to a scientific paper about some sort of field that makes rats fall over?\nAs a blind person, I would love it if the device could simply be pointed in the general direction of a threat and cover a wider area, say a shotgun stun device.<p>This has interesting second order implications which I haven't thought about -- what happens when you can easily go up to someone, shoot them, paralyze them for 30 minutes and steal their stuff? But all things considered, if someone is going to steal my stuff, I'd rather live through the experience.<p>Thoughts? Am I completely off base? Or is this a reasonable way to approach the protection part of the problem?",1359017965

5108462,comment,5107055,5107055,11,0,noelwelsh,,,"I agree with this post but I'm more optimistic than the author that a solution will be found.<p>Let me use HN for examples, as that's the site I'm most familiar with.<p>The author correctly identifies that HN does a poor job of selecting new items to display. Technically, HN exploits too much (gives existing high ranking stories too much front page time) and doesn't explore enough (give new stories a chance). I also expect that the population who reads the ""new"" list behaves differently to that who read exclusively the front page.<p>We can fix both problems! We know of algorithms to balance exploration and exploitation -- they're known as bandit algorithms. Instead of displaying a fixed front page to everyone, choose the stories to show to balance exploration and exploitation. This way new stories get a fairer chance and the population observing both is the same.<p>There are some technical issues but they are solvable. I work on this stuff in my day job (Myna -- mynaweb.com -- go sign up now! ;-) and we have an algorithm for handling preference data. It would need some adjustment but it's doable.<p>Next up is voting rings and so on. Also solvable -- stop using votes as the only input signal. Observe what people actually do -- do they actually click the link? Come back and comment? These are strong indications of interest. How much text do they write? It's just a few words it's more likely to be a spammy ""ata boy!"" comment. How long do they spend on the link (maybe we can track this by using an iframe?) and do they scroll? The point is there are a whole heap more signals that people give to indicate real interest. Start using these and it becomes much harder to forge interest.<p>This area is known as implicit feedback, and again there is a decent body of work available.",1359017846

Read at your own risk.<p>Interactive web-based documents are not new, nor are the ideas that Bret Victor is exploring, but a synthesis as sophisticated and holistic as Bret's <i>is</i>.<p>One core idea embedded in all of Bret's work is that learning happens best when students are able to explore multiple representations of a idea or aspects of an environment simultaneously.  The more quickly one representation changes in reaction to the other, the stronger the learning feedback loop, and the more quickly the student builds an accurate mental model of how the thing they're interacting with works.<p>So, WRT your point, it's not about the fact that the documents are interactive, but that they're ""reactive.""  The interactive bits are all related to each other, and when one part changes all the other parts change with it, in real-time.<p>There's something in this immediacy that even the slightest delay destroys.<p>That's not a new idea; anyone who has read Mindstorms (1980) or grew up on LOGO has had at least an inkling of it.  Lots of research ink as been spilled over this, and many ""pedagogical"" programming environments (Scratch, etc.) flirt with it.  Even Bret would say that, I bet.<p>But, well, he's taken it to a whole 'nother level.  He's actively exploring this idea on multiple fronts, from reactive documents to reactive programming environments, and shitting gold all around town.<p>Every time he publishes something it takes months for people to react, absorb, and respond.  See, e.g., <a href=""http://www.lighttable.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lighttable.com/</a><p>Even if you don't think what he's doing is particularly special, there's something about the way he does it that causes big waves every time he publishes something.",1359017752

XML Schema is an awful mess - it's not even representable in XML; it's not a good language for expressing validation constraints, it's neither simple enough to be easy, nor powerful enough to express all your requirements. And the need to support schema leads to DTDs and namespaces, which are responsible for most of the screwups of using XML in the real world.<p>If XML were just tags, parsers didn't try to connect to the internet to validate everything, and tools didn't bother with namespaces, it would be usable enough that we probably wouldn't have needed to invent JSON.",1359017690

You're talking about a system for autonomously controlling every motor vehicle in the U.S., or even the world -- that's effectively the end game. Google is among the handful of companies that has the computing infrastructure to have a ""pulse"" on the world at all times, and within those companies they are heads and shoulders above the rest in terms of being able to implement large scale, distributed information processing algorithms with low latency at that scale. It's a very rare, maybe completely unique cross section of capabilities. Google is better suited to solving this problem in many ways than any other problem they're currently solving.<p>The point is the capabilities I'm talking about have nothing to do with cars and everything to do with computing.

However that's a fairly rare occurrence over the lifetime of a highly personal device, and I feel Microsoft has made the right decision in prioritizing personal organization.<p>Tile sizes and placements are indeed ""arbitrarily assigned"" simply because they're chosen by the user. Anecdotally, everybody I know with a Windows Phone has tinkered with the tile layout. The lack of whitespace is not a problem when you've placed all those items there yourself. The ability to vary tile sizes further improves spatial orientation within the customized screen.<p>(Think of items on your desk -- in order to tell them apart, do you insist that they are all the same size and at least 20 cm away from each other? Probably not, because those items have some other meaning to you than simply ""object on my desk"").<p>Another misunderstanding about Windows Phone is the content of the tiles. In screenshots it looks garish to have some tiles in a solid color and others filled with photos. In practice there's a strong consistency at work: any tile that is non-flat is displaying the user's own content. Furthermore these tiles usually also have an element of motion so that the non-flat content is not static. (For example, the People tile shows the user's contacts with varying animations, and the Pictures tile shows the user's photos as a slideshow with smooth panning.)",1359017060

I have nothing against frameworks or libraries at all, it's just the way the evolution of development have changed.<p>The most frustrating (yes, I've said it, frustrating) issue I've seen is the quick development of applications that is deployed to market (especially in corporate environment). What's not measured very effectively are the non-functional business requirements and when issues arises, it's usually the developers with technical know-hows and understanding of the internals of a system (whether it be OS level, VM level, etc.) that can shed light to an operational issue and optimise the system to meet non-functional requirements).<p>Frameworks, etc. are mostly designed to solve functional requirements. Those ""developers"" that tend to rush quickly to frameworks and libraries tend to use them based on functional issues they've experienced during development/integrations, etc. Most develop business requirements and technical specification but excludes non-functional requirements. This tends to become estimations to development lifecycle.<p>Over time, the ""developers"" (I call them component integrators) tend to build business systems and leave before the roof gets on fire, and the experts become problem resolvers. See StackOverflow, many reputable developers are those that have extensive experiences with low-level programming and have manifested as being great help.

As an engineer/math guy, it was an incredibly interesting experience because it opened my mind to all sorts of theoretical possibilities and explorations of pattern matching, noise filtering, exotic concepts like wavelets and more.<p>However, I quickly learned a few things from experienced traders and from seeing my work move from testing to prod. What I learned makes me extremely hesitant to employ automated trading systems on my own money:<p>1. Historical back-testing is a great way to curve fit. You can hyper optimize your algorithm looking for arbitrage opportunities, trends, whatever. You'll get performance reports that make it seem like you're ready to print money. Then you get out and trade and discover that your system can't keep up with market movements because the indicators that you relied upon may have exhibited correlation but not causation.<p>2. The boon of algorithmic trading is that it attempts to remove emotion from the trading process, not that it is a better predictor. Listening to a machine should help alleviate the symptoms of ""fear and greed"" that lead to abrupt, incorrect decision making. Think about that for a minute, some hedge funds advocate algorithms not because of predictive power but as guarantees of rational decision making.<p>3. Conversely, while developing and testing a system, a smart person will almost inevitably try to bring in exotic concepts into price prediction, order sizing and trend following functions. Given enough time, complexity will increase until it becomes challenging to understand the rationale behind a system's output. Trading this way is scary because real money is being moved without an understanding of fundamental and macro-factors.<p>4. You will <i>very</i> likely lose money. Even at the size of our fund (1B under management) we were sometimes at the mercy of market makers who gave us crap prices on trades or seemingly manipulated prices to hit our stop orders and cause us to exit positions too early.<p>I love seeing the ideas behind algorithmic trading popularized, however I want to make sure that anyone embarking on it understands the market as a system and not just as a time series to be modelled. It's composed of real human beings, with emotions running wild. If you decide to play, then play, but do so wisely and carefully and remember to keep it simple.",1359015181

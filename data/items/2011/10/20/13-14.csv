They don't use screen space well, and remote desktop is not possible to get larger-scale work done. I think they need to go back to using trackballs and styluses, because precision can't be achieved using fingers or by using the focus method in apps... The best use case i can think of for my phone these days is Angry Birds. Also, what ever happened to solar power? we're powering small cars off of solar cells, why in 2011 can't we power cell phones off of solar energy? The phones being ultra-thin, and thus having tiny batteries that only last for 30 minutes of work, does not make the phones smart, it limits them greatly.

3134678,comment,3134339,3134339,11,0,jonnathanson,,,"I'll play the role of devil's advocate / British Royal Navy here.<p>This article demonstrates a shaky grasp of the entertainment industry's structure, and that shaky grasp leads the author to make unwarranted assumptions and misguided conclusions about the intent of almost wholly unrelated parties.<p>Contrary to most gut-level consumer assessments of the industry, the industry itself is not some monolithic and homogenous unit. Within the industry are countless different companies and parties, as different from one another as, say, Apple is from Google. (Though Apple's products and Google's products often intermingle, it would be silly to conflate the two companies altogether into one, single-minded unit; this is essentially what the author of this piece does with companies in the entertainment business).<p>To wit:<p><i>""Gladiator, Channel 10....What better time for a giant cartoon helicopter to fly around the screen announcing, ""Don't forget, Merrick and Rosso! The B-Team! Every Wednesday night at 7.30!""<p>I remember every syllable of that ad. Positioning ads like this is, Gruen has told us, is most effective as we're at our most vulnerable. But at the same time this was like the network raising its middle finger at the us...</i><p>First of all, more likely than not, this wasn't the ""network."" This was your local affiliate station (Channel 10). In this case, the station's general manager was the one ""raising his middle finger"" at you. He purchased the broadcast rights to the movie. He is one person. He is not employed by the network whose programs he carries on the national portions of his airtime. (And this movie airing was likely a local portion).<p>More to the point: neither he, nor the network with which his station is affiliated, had anything to do with the making of the movie. To be angry at this promo placement is fine; to draw conclusions that the company who made the movie bears any responsibility for this placement is silly. If you don't want to watch ""Gladiator"" with local promos thrown in, don't watch it on local TV. Watch the DVD, the Blu-ray, Netflix, iTunes, cable on-demand, or any of the other legitimate ways to view ""Gladiator"" that are at your disposal. It's absurd to make the claim that piracy is your only hassle-free way of viewing the film, or that it's the only reasonable resort left to someone so offended by a local promo in a local broadcast.<p>At the end of the day, much of this piece is the same, warmed-over and intellectually lazy argument in favor of piracy that we've all heard a million times before. It's an argument that attempts to justify theft by pointing to the supposedly heavy burdens born by legal purchase, and by villifying the producers and distributors of said product. And that argument doesn't hold up. The consumer burdens (some forms of DRM notwithstanding) really aren't that onerous, and the companies behind the content -- while slow to grok the technology disrupting them, and thus highly reactionary -- aren't some evil cabal hell-bent on fucking you over. Let's call this what it really is: piracy is convenient, cheap, and mostly consequence-free. That's why everyone likes it. Let's not add a veneer of moral justification to it.<p>People can find post-facto justifications for pretty much anything they like doing. If people found a way to steal gasoline cheaply and easily, they'd come around to the idea that the oil companies were getting what they deserved. If stealing produce off the shelves of Whole Foods were no big thing, we'd point to our least favorite Whole Foods business practices as justification for our actions. And so on and so forth.<p>Two wrongs don't make a right. Hollywood does a lot of things wrong. No question about it. But piracy <i>predated</i> many of everyone's critiques of the business, and the practices everyone hates so much. Furthermore, piracy has only made the situation <i>worse</i>, by making the entertainment companies more paranoid, more reactionary, and more defensive.<p>If we really want to change the Hollywood distribution model -- which certainly <i>does</i> need rethinking -- then let's act constructively about it. Let's form startups in that space. Let's support, by voting with our wallets, disruptive and interesting players in that space. Let's not rebel against the marketplace, but rather, let's demonstrate the voice of the consumer <i>in</i> the marketplace by shifting power and resources to the companies making strides in favor of the consumer.",1319116870

A system appeared which inserted noise and interference when people tried to compress music from CDs.<p>I never heard about this, but I'm very interested. Can't seem to find anything about it on Google, can anyone link me?",1319115867

If anything, I'd love to see a glued together collection of videos from the founders, pg, and the rest of the team (sort of like pg's post not too long ago of pictures of the early days of YC). It doesn't have to be produced to be entertaining and the story wouldn't need to be written (it would simply be the YC companies going through the experience).",1319115677

They don't get integrated into the normal engineering environment, and they wind up in <i>more</i> buildings which normal badges won't open.  Look up building 1489 for an example.<p>When I heard about this non-integration, my interpretation was that normal eng is where things go to die, so they were keeping the new things separate so they would not die.  Then I realized, hey wait, if the core engineering area is sufficiently broken to where one of the founders is purposely keeping his own toys away from it, what does that say about us?",1319115641

Anyone with the ability to install an alternate OS working in such an environment should have the knowledge to not do something that stupid. The fault here is with the person, not the software. Protecting users from themselves so much that they have no control of the software on their machines as an alternative to your scenario seems like giving up too much.",1319115607

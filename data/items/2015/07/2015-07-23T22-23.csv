Easily beaten by the train.<p>Assuming I&#x27;d have a car already, though, I&#x27;d already have paid for the car, insurance, MOT, tax, blah blah. So for a journey I&#x27;m contemplating taking, where the choice is car vs train, the train is competing against the marginal per mile cost: roughly, fuel+repairs.<p>For this my car&#x27;s cost has been £0.28/mile - a figure that usually turns out to be pretty close to the cost of the train. (In fact, this comparison is being unduly generous to the train, because most of my driving is short trips. For longer trips the car is more fuel efficient, making the marginal cost more like £0.20/mile.) I&#x27;m also not taking into account the cost of travel to the station.<p>But then again, I&#x27;m also assuming there will be free parking at your destination...",1437692380

In most cases, the internet is their core business and they take care of their servers.<p>Going to the top 100 most visited sites, this drops to 93% ‘fully safe’. In other words, we could detect outdated software on 7 of the top 100 sites. In most cases, these were minor issues but we are already see that some sites have relaxed policies on server security.<p>The further we go from the most visited sites, the more servers have outdated software.

You can pick up on some common assignment patterns, but not all the weird stuff people do. Just check out the top 10 NPM modules and I guarantee you&#x27;ll find some odd assignment patterns. I can remember that the &quot;colors&quot; module did meta stuff when I last checked. You can&#x27;t just easily run the code to find out what the module is exporting either, because of potential side effects from IO. You can wrap Node&#x27;s core IO modules, but that solution is specific to Node, and still won&#x27;t cover every possible case. In short, it&#x27;s a huge pain to write tools to pull information out of Javascript code in general, and that hurts the tooling ecosystem around Javascript.<p>With the class pattern you at least have some staticly inferable information you&#x27;re sure you can pull out of the class, and weird stuff is discouraged. I know in some ways that this is a weak argument, because of the new square bracket assignment, and the fact that anyone can muck with the prototype of the class after it&#x27;s created. Even still, for the simple OLOO case it does encourage people to write code that has method names that can easily be staticly inferred, and that&#x27;s a good thing for JS tooling possibilities.<p>I really just want omnicompletion that doesn&#x27;t randomly break on me!

They don&#x27;t take kindly to you hitting their revenue streams which are, generally, ads. However, they do work with people very well, though it is slow and bureaucratic. So to give you the simple answers:<p>Was it possible for you to monetize the videos as you saw fit? Hell no. But it was possible for us to monetize the videos.<p>Were you allowed to place your own ads with them? Yes<p>Or strip Youtube&#x27;s ads and place your own in the metadata? We worked with them to accomplish something like this yes.<p>Or did you have another way to monetize? Yes, this too :)<p>We made a bit of money on this system we built and it was more or less self sustaining. The issue was that it actually wasn&#x27;t that profitable. We had another product which was almost like a little helper we made internally for ourselves that turned out to be a TON more lucrative so we gave up on the video and image network and eventually shut it down. Sometimes you have to just know when to fold them.",1437689595

9938820,comment,9937251,9938235,0,0,prawn,,,"I think there will be some eventual movement in remote working, virtual offices, etc. The hard part of telepresence is contact, but physical contact isn&#x27;t something that is an issue in a typical office environment - it&#x27;s facial expressions, screen sharing, etc. Once the resolution can handle virtual screens and facial tracking can handle some level of expressive avatars, we&#x27;ll see some movement.<p>Bosses will be more comfortable with remote workers when they can keep track of them like other workers in what feels like a real office.<p>Businesses will start to reconsider leasing an expensive physical office and instead leave their workers in home offices, while having them interact in a virtual space. Virtual desktops, virtual screens, look sideways or behind you in the room to see virtual colleagues.<p>In a small web business, I can spend $xk on goggles, have everyone work from home, and save $x0k on rent. Then imagine game chat from consoles applied to an office. A whisper goes to your team, a shout to everyone. Employees could set their status to leave-me-alone to be left off everything but the most crucial announcement - that&#x27;s an improvement on current open plan offices where you only option is headphones. A toggled HUD could show what the rest of the team is working on, etc.<p>Before avatars have expressions, I can imagine people working in a virtual office full of helmeted Daft Punk colleagues.",1437689480

If there is no plate tectonics then all the CO2 gets locked up in carbonates and the temperature falls (e.g. Mars) or you get a run away greenhouse like Venus. It is plate tectonics that have kept earth in the habitable zone. In theory we should be able to detect such a temp delta.",1437689372

There also isn&#x27;t a resource cost of acquiring, training, and integrating a new share into your portfolio.<p>Recruiters typically work for for-profit businesses, that maximize returns on sales, meaning they are going to try to charge organizations slightly less than it would cost the organization to do it in house.<p>The increased liquidity in job markets drops the amount of time it takes to match a job opening with a job seeker, which eliminates inefficiencies.

2622348,comment,2622271,2622271,5,0,dkersten,,,"I think its an interesting project, and if they can actually produce it as inexpensively as they hope (or even twice that - $50 is still a good price point!), I think it will be useful in schools simply because kids will be able to own one themselves, bring it home etc, which I think will inspire (at least some of) them to learn more and do more interesting things with them outside of the classroom. As somebody in another HN post about this said: ""get technology into as many hands as possible"" - this is certainly a great thing!<p>However, I think the statements in the video about how computers have become much more complex and that is why people aren't learning to program them at a young age is incorrect. BBC Micros and ZX Spectrums (and Commodore's and Amigas and all the rest) were, IMHO, <i>not</i> easier to learn with compared to todays computers. They were actually much less accessible and therefore attracted the type of people who were able to learn. Smaller audiences of more capable people (because the less capable people were never attracted to them in the first place) gives the illusion that they were simpler and easier, even when they weren't.<p>Todays computers are usable by just about anyone and most people are exposed to them in some way through games, social networking, websites.. whatever. The amount of people learning to program is probably a lot higher today than it ever was as the barrier to entry is so much lower (going from something as simple as Scratch, to web development with Javascript, to Ruby and Python and Processing - a lot of simple, yet powerful, tools (with instant feedback) are now available), its just that the percentage of people learning to program out of all the people using computers is now a lot lot lower.<p>I don't see how this device would be able to make it any easier than a full blown computer (once somebody found and installed the software for the kids) except that 1) it will have the tools preinstalled and 2) it will be inexpensive enough that each kid can be given their own one creating a sense of ownership and hopefully inspiring and encouraging them to do cool stuff with them (which in turn means they learn more).<p>TL;DR: This thing does have potential, but I think they (at least the people who made the video) are focusing on the wrong thing (bringing back the 80's of computers and programming because they feel it was simpler back then, while I believe it is a lot lot simpler <i>now</i>).",1307293176
2622347,comment,2622238,2622238,17,0,TheSkeptic,,,"Undercapitalization is one of the most common reasons a company fails. Have successful businesses been started with $5,000 or less? Sure. But don't drink the Kool Aid. Lesson #1: it usually takes a lot more than $5,000 to get a business going and to sustain it long enough to reach break-even. In your case, just think of it this way: any salesman worth his salt is unlikely to work for less than $5,000/month...<p>Lesson #2: at the age of 24, if you don't have even $5,000 worth of savings that you can afford to blow and need to <i>borrow</i> that amount from family, you should probably take a step back and think long and hard about your financial priorities. Depending on your location and your education and/or skills, you can probably <i>earn</i> $5,000/month, if not substantially more, working for someone else. Yeah, that's not as cool as starting a business, but opportunity costs are greatest at your age. What's really not cool: wasting away your twenties and having nothing to show for your efforts once you hit 30. Sure, everybody in StartupVille is always one venture away from a big exit or a $100,000/month business, but when you go to conferences and meetups and see thirty-somethings who have no net worth because they've been swinging for the fences since they were 20, it isn't pretty. Bottom line: at your age, in the absence of substantial existing savings or alternate sources of income (a trust fund, etc.), working on <i>anything</i> that requires you to ""work for free"" for any length of time is likely to be really, really harmful to your finances in the long run.",1307293167

There are a total of ten chapters which are basically re-edit of my previous LoveMyTool posts. In this short book (50+ papes), I summarize my twenty years experience in high-tech startups, based on my two companies, one VC-funded and one self-funded.<p>There are no overnight successes. Building a startup is a journey not a race and it is about value-creation not valuation. I write about my survival techniques in creating values for potential customers which is a much slower, much longer, much more demanding but yet ultimately much more financially rewarding journey than creating valuation for potential investors.<p>The first 100 downloads are free.  I am hoping to get enough exposure so that as many first-time entrepreneurs as possible could benefit from this book. If you like the book, as a personal favor to me, please rate and comment on Lulu.com.

In this case, based on what you have said here, you have taken your competitors name, and added ""my"" in front of it. So most reasonable people would conclude that it is highly likely someone will mistake your competitors brand for yours.<p>If you were in a completely different industry than the similarly named company, then there would be some wiggle room, because you could argue that even if someone was initially confused about the two companies, there is no possibility for them to buy your product thinking it was the competitors. However, you are in the exact same industry, so the likely conclusion is that the customer will be confused and likely to buy your product thinking its your competitors.<p>Unfortunately, the domain name issue is irrelevant in the face of trademark law. In fact, as has happened with many other infringement suits, it is likely that if you lost the lawsuit, you would be forced to transfer the domain to your competitor.",1307292954

2622316,comment,2622166,2622264,4,0,6ren,,,"The article's just claiming that the modules of dynamic languages can be compiled independently; not that it will be correct.<p>Just my thoughts: There's a bigger question here about types, though. I think the argument is that the ceremony of types gets in the way more than it helps, and it requires up-front design. Many people like dynamic languages for their flexibility; and when you get bugs, you have to fix them anyway. There's an assumption in typed languages that we can design our types well enough upfront to help solve the problem.<p>It's interesting how types create a dependency on the interface (i.e. if you use a type, you depend on it). One of the ideas of Abstract Data Types was to reduce dependency on the internal implementation details; but you're still dependent on the external interface. If you change the interface, it creates problems (e.g. unit testing claims to give you confidence to refactor, but if you change interfaces, you also have to change the tests...). <i>EDIT</i> added ""claims to""<p>This seems intrinsic to modularity, and I can't really see any solution to this; except for ways to make it easier to cope with interface change. Some insights may come from webapp API's, where the dependency is more explicit (you have to send and receive serialized messages).",1307292381

2622312,comment,2621371,2622073,17,0,cletus,,,"Well, in all fairness, Switzerland is much like Monaco, Beverly Hills and certain Carribean islands in that its poverty is essentially exported.<p>Switzerland makes it very difficult to become a citizen unless you're born to at least one Swiss parent or you marry a Swiss citizen (there are people whose families have been living in Switzerland since the 20s who can't become citizens).<p>There are a large contingent of workers who work in Switzerland every day but don't live there (and, in fact, aren't allowed to even if they wanted to and could afford it), particular in Geneva.<p>It's also one of the most expensive countries on Earth.<p>So, I wouldn't say the low crime rates are so much a question of effective social policy but rather of being both wealthy and exclusionary.<p>Yes, laws are different between the two and certainly there are cultural differences too. Zurich is very definitely (mainland) European. Singapore is quite definitely Asian.<p>There are severe penalties on drug trafficking because it's a big problem, with proximity to the Golden Triangle and so on. Singapore is also surrounded by Indonesia and Malaysia, places where the illicit trades have far more freedom of movement. Singapore, with some justification, seeks to avoid being a conduit or waypoint or (even worse) a destination for the drug trade.<p>The no smoking in public thing I consider a huge plus. The chewing gum thing is a bit weird. I think it has something to do with vandalism.<p>As for Zurich being strict, I imagine you don't view them that way because you're accustomed to them. Throwing out trash is a classic example. First you have to buy Zurisache (sp?) for like 2 CHF each. Throwing them out in anything else can get you fined.<p>Then you have to separate your trash into three different types of glass (white, brown, green), other recyclables and non-recyclables. Where you see trash cans in public there are like 6-7 different cans for the different categories of trash.<p>Newspapers and possibly other forms of paper (I forget) had to be thrown out on different days to regular trash. Those had to be tied with string in a neat bundle.<p>All of the above is enforced by the Mutzpolizei (literally ""trash police"").<p>The anmelden/abmelden (registration) system, which is the norm on mainland Europe, is extremely weird--even invasive--to most people from English speaking countries.<p>In Switzerland, depending on what Canton you live in, you can't make excessive noise after 10pm or before 7am (which I actually appreciate). In Zurich in some buildings this extended to regulations in certain apartments prohibiting men from urinating while standing up at those times (due to thin walls; this was deemed ""excessive noise"").<p>Some cantons also prohibited ""excessive noise"" or work on Sundays (for the entire day).<p>IIRC there were given days where you were and weren't allowed to move house.<p>Switzerland has its fair share of regulation is all I'm saying.",1307292179

Often they don't have anyone dedicated on security (warning signal #1), and they'll let you remote into their network without many restrictions (warning signal #2). The other businesses are usually to the other extreme on security. They want documentation that you have a secure development policy, they'll do an independent security audit, they won't allow remote access under any circumstances, and some won't even allow any direct access at all (you have to prepare documentation that their people can follow for any modification that must be made to the system).

Say module X depends upon module Y having function foo- this is a statement which is independent of static vr.s dynamic checking. This means that that modularity is lost- you can't have a module Y which doesn't have a function foo. If module Y doesn't have a function foo, the program is going to fail, the only questions are when and how.<p>What I don't get is why detecting the error early is a disadvantage. It's well known that the earlier a bug is detected, the cheaper it is to fix.

2622246,comment,2619650,2620010,1,0,Jebdm,,,"A little bit of explanation about formalisms and the communication problems you mention from a computer scientist/linguist who gets that same look of satisfaction:<p>In natural languages, the relationships between utterances and what they convey are somewhat fuzzy.  Words like ""tree"" and ""run"" don't have single precise meanings; they have a variety of senses associated with them, and these senses vary in how closely they are related to each other.  Biological trees made of cells are quite closely related to computer science trees by their shared shape; the relation between running with your legs and running for office is a bit fuzzier, via the race metaphor; the relation between a river bank and a financial bank is even more unclear.<p>Meaning in natural language is built in aggregate from associations, with the senses of expressions converging over time in groups of communicating speakers.  Natural languages do not clearly define the relationships between different expressions, nor between expressions and the real world.  Because natural languages are unspecified and evolving, you can only measure how often (in your observation) different expressions and relationships between expression reflect different situations.<p>Formalisms, like natural langauges, are also used to represent meaning via expressions made of symbols and relationships between them.  (Technically, formalisms don't have to represent anything, but in practice they usually do because otherwise they're not very useful.)  Unlike natural languages, formal languages have normatively defined specifications.  These specifications can be written in a variety of ways, but usually they define rules (which always apply) for deriving expressions from each other.<p>To be able to use formal languages for real-life problems, you need to have these five skills:<p>Symbol manipulation: deriving expression in desirable forms from old ones using a specification\nInterpretation: relating formal expression to the domain\nEncoding: capturing domain knowledge in the formal language\nAbstraction: finding consistent patterns in the domain (to be expressed in the formalism)\nModeling: expressing relationships in the domain using relationships between symbols<p>Unfortunately, most people are not very good at these skills.  It is hard to break habits like using intuition and relying on others' ability to resolve ambiguity.  Furthermore, most people are not very good at dealing with abstractions, especially new ones or higher-level ones.  To make things worse, some of the problems involved in using formal systems are genuinely hard, even for computers and mathematicians.  Obviously, even the most accomplished mathematicians are not always able to get the results they are looking for, let alone quickly, but people who are good with formalisms usually don't have as many problems with things like checking their intuition or dealing with abstractions.<p>The problem with communicating formal ideas to people who are not good with formalisms is rather fundamental, because the very attributes which make formalisms useful are the ones that those people have trouble understanding.  You can, of course, relate the results of using a formalism, but without using formalisms it is often very hard to usefully express the ""why"" of the result.  The problem is compounded because people who are good with formalisms have a hard time figuring out what is understandable to others, due to the general ""knowing it too well to teach it"" effect as well as lack of practice (since most people who care about formalisms are good with them).<p>Some talented communicators are able to explain formal results satisfactorily to others by relating them to familiar abstractions or rephrasing their logic in everyday terms, but unfortunately this frequently results in misunderstanding and misapplication of the results.  Furthermore, there are a number of formal results which really can't be properly understood unless you have mastered the skills above (particularly in theoretical computer science and formal logic).  The problem is akin to trying to talk to non-programmers about programming, but more general.  Programming languages are formal languages, of a sort, but most programmers only understand a few particular formalisms.  Theoretical computer science and proof theory involve dealing with a larger and more abstract set of formalisms, including formalisms about formalisms.<p>If you need examples of the difficulties, just look at all the ways that people try to explain Gödel's incompleteness theorems or monads informally.",1307290143

2622238,story,,,154,92,calebhicks,"Ask HN: My Startup is Going to Die Because I Messed Up",,"I'm 24. I started a company 7 months ago, planning to bootstrap it with $5,000 borrowed from family.<p>We started working hard at creating our brand. Logos, webdesign, website copy, flyers, and SEO. We divided our time equally between these tasks and selling the product. We were headed to profitability in short order.<p>I quickly learned my cofounder was over his head in personal debt, and could no longer work full time. Some of our borrowed money went to him to try to keep him around for a couple of extra months ($1,200). It didn't work and he had to get a job.<p>We've been floundering back and forth, spent the majority of our money, I invested another $1,000 to help us make one more sales surge to allow us to dedicate more time. We planned to see if this startup would work, setting a sales and spending goal in under 60 days. Success and we continue, failure and we cut our losses.<p>We planned  to make it happen starting next week.<p>Friday afternoon I got a call from a business owner in another state, telling me that our business name infringes on his trademark for his business name. Our name would be mycompanyname to his companyname. We had only checked and seen that companyname.com didn't exist, we did not check the trademark database.<p>At this point, discouraged, unable to afford new marketing materials and a complete redo of everything we've done so far, we're left with little money and a threat of a lawsuit if we don't change everything.<p>Here are the mistakes that I made, and will learn from:<p>1) Learn about the financial position of any cofounder. A cofounder's personal situation will hugely impact his/her ability to grow the business.<p>2) Investigate any trademarks or copyrights on any of your branding or naming. Wasting time in a bootstrapped business will ruin you.<p>3) Have a plan. Not just a mental plan, but an actual written plan. Decide what is required of the cofounders, decide where money will go, decide your failure point.<p>4) Be prepared to drop the project, or go it alone. Putting all of your eggs in a basket carried by your cofounder can lead to disaster if you aren't prepared to run with the project yourself.<p>What other lessons can I learn from this? Where can I improve so that my next project doesn't fail in similar fashion?<p>tldr: My business failed because I made mistakes in timing, my cofounder, and business branding. What else can I learn from my experience?<p>EDIT: After a few comments, and an e-mail, I should clarify that this is not necessarily a web-startup or app. It's a business targeting seniors (hence the flyers, which were placed in senior centers and used at senior health conferences). My cofounder came into the picture as the one with more experience working with the senior market. We had suppliers for our product, so our main focus was to sell, sell, sell. So, to add another lesson:<p>5) Cash in a small bootstrapped company should be spent on client acquisition. Not on whiteboards, office refrigerators, business cards, or flyers.",1307289716

This would mean that iPhone uswers are 100 times more likely to surf the net than S60 users.<p>Could be, I am not sure what kind of marketing Nokia globally has for the S60 and browsing, and how aware people generally are of it.<p>It is easy to get a biased picture based on people around you. Me and a few of my friends surf train timetables/TV programs etc. almost daily on their S60 devices. And there aren't that many iPhones in Finland yet.",1196849964

Interface cloning and heavy borrowing of element layouts has a long and storied history in software design - look at any modern GUI and they all look much more similar than dissimilar. Is that the murky and collaborative nature of creative work? Hell no, it's people copying off of each other. And it's a good thing, unless you think it'd be a great idea to have to retrain everyone every time IT wanted to switch application providers (that used to be common).<p>Assuming you still disagree, I'd be curious about your opinion of non design issues. Do you think samba is bullshit for having reverse engineered the CIFS interface allowing non windows computers to share on corporate lans? How about various office applications that reverse engineered the file formats of various closed competitors to allow them to save and load the formats? Surely a lot of hard work went into designing CIFS or .xls, should that be off limits as well?

2033331,comment,2031585,2033275,0,0,grantheaslip,,,"> First, nobody is told they're not allowed to attend church. In fact, people who are excommunicated from the Mormon church are in fact _encouraged_ to keep attending so that they can come back into what's called ""full fellowship"" of the church by changing their lives to meet the standards of the church.<p>You're probably right here. I've heard contrary, but I haven't done my research on that, and I know there's a tonne of misinformation on both sides.<p>> Secondly, there is a distinction between being gay and having sex. Mormons, gay or straight, can't have sex outside of marriage. If a gay person has outside of marriage they are subject to the same discipline that a straight person who has sex outside of marriage would have. Some of my gay, believing Mormon friends are simply chaste. Some of my gay, believing Mormon friends are in heterosexual marriages. They do this with the full knowledge of their spouses, and with no hope of becoming straight, just because they feel like it's the right thing for them.<p>By ""just because they feel like it's the right thing for them"", I'm assuming what you mean here is ""because they have no other option"". I can't imagine an openly gay person choosing to be in a heterosexual marriage because it ""feels right"". What you just said might sound perfectly natural in Salt Lake City, but it would be an utterly ridiculous, and possibly offensive idea in, say, Toronto.<p>> Nobody is telling anybody they can't go to heaven or be a real Mormon unless they stop being gay. They're saying, ""be chaste."" I know that's a distinction that will probably be lost, but it's a real distinction, and a real requirement that all Mormons try to live up to when they're not married.<p>But if you say ""you can't get married to someone who's the opposite sex"" and ""you can't have sex unless you're married"", what you're really saying is that gay people are never allowed to have sex with the gender they were born attracted to. I consider that cruel and inhumane. And I'm not buying the ""gay people can go to heaven thing"". The church's stated policy is that ""Homosexual behaviour violates the commandments of God"". That's a pretty clear indictment.<p>> All that notwithstanding, I assure you I'm not lying about my gay Mormon friends, if you're ever in the Salt Lake area look me up, I'm sure they'd love to meet you :) One of them is always looking for good hackers for various projects.<p>If I'm ever in SLS, I might, I really do want to understand the thought processes here, but I can't say that it's at the top of my list of travel destinations, with all due respect :).",1293071910

It requires business people to learn a modicum of technical and logical skills to fill out the high level models, and it takes engineers out of their development time to drag it down through the rest of the levels of abstraction to get to actually getting down to working.

I remember when I was younger I did work for a heating company that did boiler inspections in NY. The NYC DOB has specific forms that you had to fill out and specific places for your text. In cases where the text overflowed beyond the 8 or so alloted lines, we were able to create a duplicate page and continue in a copy of the form with the remainder of information. We could this as much as we needed to, so long as the information was in the proper form. This seems like the same logic would be applicable here too. Limit to 150 words, and if it's beyond the page, simply finish on another page.<p>Alternatively, like you said, you could figure out the necessary font-size based on the word-count, length, or even client's sizing information.",1293070746

Inadequate modeling.  Weak correlations.<p>Analyzing news, per se, isn't an issue.

2033300,comment,2031586,2033000,0,0,haberman,,,"I agree with you.  I just wanted to list the one complaint I do have about C: missed optimization opportunities due to lax aliasing rules.<p>Consider the following C translation unit:<p><pre><code>    void foo(const int *i);
    void bar();

    int baz() {
      int i = 1;
      foo(&i);
      return i + 1;
    }

    int quux() {
      int i;
      foo(&i);
      i = 1;
      bar();
      return i + 1;
    }
</code></pre>
You'd like to think that both baz() and quux() could compile the return statements to a constant ""return 2.""  After all, foo() is taking a pointer to a CONST int.  But alas, this is not the case, because foo() could cast away the const.  So in truth, both functions are forced to reload the integer from the stack, add 1 to it, and then return that!  You can't use any values you had loaded in registers (or in this case, you can't evaluate the expression at compile time).<p>My example is contrived, but you can easily construct examples that fit the same pattern and are real.<p>I've heard that Fortran still beats C in optimization in some cases; I would expect that the above is one major reason why.  C99's ""restrict"" addresses some of the difference but cannot help you with the above.",1293070664

In fact, people who are excommunicated from the Mormon church are in fact _encouraged_ to keep attending so that they can come back into what's called ""full fellowship"" of the church by changing their lives to meet the standards of the church.<p>Secondly, there is a distinction between being gay and having sex.  Mormons, gay or straight, can't have sex outside of marriage.  If a gay person has outside of marriage they are subject to the same discipline that a straight person who has sex outside of marriage would have.  Some of my gay, believing Mormon friends are simply chaste.  Some of my gay, believeing Mormon friends are in heterosexual marriages.  They do this with the full knowledge of their spouses, and with no hope of becoming straight, just because they feel like it's the right thing for them.<p>Nobody is telling anybody they can't go to heaven or be a real Mormon unless they stop being gay.  They're saying, ""be chaste.""  I know that's a distinction that will probably be lost, but it's a real distinction, and a real requirement that all Mormons try to live up to when they're not married.<p>All that notwithstanding, I assure you I'm not lying about my gay Mormon friends, if you're ever in the Salt Lake area look me up, I'm sure they'd love to meet you :)  One of them is always looking for good hackers for various projects.",1293070103

In all honesty, I remembered more about texts that I speed read than texts I would read normally.<p>The only real difference was that when speed reading I didn't have the <i>feeling</i> that I know the full text, but when tested the knowledge would just magically appear out of nowhere; knowledge I didn't know I had.<p>Eventually I stopped speed reading because it's too much effort. Usually when I'm reading it's to relax the mind, give it a low effort activity to keep itself busy while I rest. Speed reading seemed counter productive for that sort of thing.<p>Also, speed reading is rubbish for fiction books. You get none of the pleasant pictures in your head and watching the book like an imaginative movie, but all of the feeling of consuming information at a breakneck pace without much time to take pleasure in it.<p>PS: my main issue with normal reading is that it isn't taxing enough. Especially when I'm trying to study something. Then my mind starts looking for a distraction and I suddenly realise I have no idea what I'm reading. Or simply get bored of it. Speed reading very effectivelyf orces you to focus on what you're reading (probably why I have a higher retention rate when speed reading)",1361800780
5278969,comment,5278585,5278954,5,0,Anderkent,,,"So you agree then? I did not say a judge should propose any evidence.<p>Perhaps it's easiest to explain with an example.\nLet's say the defence argues for A, and prosecution argues for B. The prosecution shows that the probability of A being true is 1%. The judge can <i>not</i> take that as a B having a probability of 99%, since it may be that C is true.<p>Thus the judge requires prosecution to show that B is 50%+ likely, not that A is unlikely.<p>Does that make more sense?",1361800768

Depending on where you are, the latter two are sometimes ""fused"" into a single type of law.<p>""Law makers"" -- I presume you mean legislators -- only control legislation. This is often called ""positive law"", in that somebody has to take positive action to ""make"" it where it didn't exist before.<p>By convention, the common law is considered to be ""discovered"". It exists independent of men and women, and the role of judges is to determine what it is.<p>In practice there is a dynamic tension between the evolution of the common law as it finds and adapts to new problems, and the intervention of the legislature when it decides that the law should be something else. Legislation itself quickly accretes case law that decides what the given piece of legislation means.",1361800707

That definitely is NOT the case in finance. We use the brain teasers and puzzles as a way to showcase how you think. For my interview, out of 5 brain teasers I nailed 2, was heavily helped through 2 more, and never got the last one, even with lots of help. But for each, the interviewer made it very clear that I was to think out loud. After getting the job, I later used the technique in interviews and gave positive reviews to those who had similarly struggled through puzzles but had used a similar thought process. In general we used this to weed out three different types of people:<p>1. Hard science majors who learned how to solve problems instead of think through problems. These people learned how to derive the heat diffusion equation, but would never put a story modeling a random walk in connection with that equation.<p>2. People who freeze when things get tough. Obviously a bad thing on the trade floor. While with coding you can often walk away from a hard problem, think about it, and come back, in finance, you can't walk away from losing lots of money over a short period of time ... you have to stop the bleeding.<p>3.

5278935,comment,5278585,5278886,5,0,jacques_chester,,,"The problem is that the law <i>requires</i> a statement of cause in order to apportion <i>responsibility</i>. It cannot abide uncertainty at the moment of judgement. It is accepted that, because in civil cases, the consequences of misjudgement are less severe, it is acceptable to relax the standard of judgement to ""balance of probabilities"".<p>Note the case that was mentioned inline that this case was affirming: <i>Hotson v East Berkshire Area Health Authority</i>[1]. First of all, the linked poster should be railing at <i>that</i> decision, this one merely takes it as precedent.<p>In <i>Hotson</i> there was a question about causality based on the given probability of a child's recovery. Given that a child that fell out of a tree was estimated to be 25% likely to recover, medical staff seemed to have taken the view that the child was basically a hopeless case. Perhaps if they hadn't, went the reasoning, the child might have done better because the staff would have tried harder. In that were so, some responsibility could be apportioned to the Health Authority, and not just to the child falling out of a tree.<p>The Lords ruled that the only thing that <i>certainly happened</i> was the child falling out of the tree. Counterfactuals based on probabilities couldn't be admitted because there's no way to reliably nail the damn things down. Anybody can come along with a different Bayesian network and give you a different estimate. What <i>mattered</i>, in the view of the Lords, was <i>what could be verifiably said to have actually happened</i>.<p>A more-than-standard disclaimer:<p>I am not a lawyer. I was terrible at torts.

If you don't care about the order of algorithm, there are much simpler intuitive ways of doing it.<p>Assume that you have two sorted arrays A and B. At the end of it, A followed by B needs to be sorted. Here is a simple algorithm:<p><i>Sort(A,B):<p><pre><code>    if A[0] is greater than B[0], swap A[0] and B[0]. \n        Bubble up B[0] to its right place (that is make B sorted).\n\n   Sort(A+1, B) -- stop if A reached its end.</code></pre>\n</i>\nNaive implementation, such as this is N^2.

When I was going to college in Computer science, we had to go through at least three courses in algorithms. We used to hand code most algorithms optimizing for the situation at hand.

This isn't necessarily the fault of the article, but thought I'd offer the places I couldn't follow.  Perhaps they will be useful for understanding a beginners viewpoint.<p><pre><code>  *int square(int n)    │    square :: Int -> Int*\n</code></pre>\nWould be great if you offered an example where the argument and return type differed.  As is, I don't know which order the Haskell declaration uses.<p><pre><code>  Now it is possible to write the Haskell program that will\n  naturally read from left to write\n</code></pre>\nIf this is essential at this point, it should be fleshed out more.  Otherwise it feels like a distracting aside and out of place in a short introduction.<p><pre><code>  -- before                        │    -- after\n  compute n = baz (bar (foo n))    │    wiz     n = bar (foo n)\n                                   │    compute n = baz (wiz n)\n</code></pre>\nThis seems perfectly clear, which makes me suspect the other parts are intended to be simple as well.<p><pre><code>  (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)\n</code></pre>\nNot clear why the left side is (.).  Is this because it's non-alpha?  Because it's infix?  Something else?  Order to read right hand side still unclear.  Also don't know if reuse of a, b, and c as variables is significant.<p><pre><code>  g . f = λx -> g (f x)\n</code></pre>\nCan't quite follow, but this might be because I'm not sure if the λ is syntactically important, or just a naming convention.<p><pre><code>  be expressed literally (see 1 vs λx -> g (f x));\n</code></pre>\nI can't figure out what this means, possibly because I'm not sure what 'literally' means in this context.  Also wasn't clear at first that ""1"" was meant as a number (or is that an 'L'), not a footnote or reference.<p><pre><code>                       -- A List is either\n  data List a = Empty  -- an empty node,  \n  | Cons a (List a)    -- or a cons cell\n</code></pre>\nWould help to define a ""cons cell"".  Is Cons a data type or a function here?  Is there a standard for capitalization?   Not clear to me how the 'a' on the left side relates to the two on the right. Is 'data' a keyword, a type, or something else?<p><pre><code>  inc-all l = map (λe -> e + 1) l\n</code></pre>\nThroughout this whole section, I had no idea which characters were one's and which were L's.  I ended up cutting and pasting into emacs and capitalizing.  Perhaps something other than 'l' for the placeholder variable?  Or it is more than a placeholder?  The concept seemed straightforward, but the example was very hard to figure out.<p><pre><code>  It is not obvious from the syntax, but Haskell functions      \n  only have one argument.\n  </code></pre>\nWould help to mention this before the (.) example.<p><pre><code>  Multiple arguments are emulated by returning functions.\n</code></pre>\nSo I guess this means the argument is on the left of the first '->' and the return type is to the right?  And how should '->' be pronounced when spoken?<p><pre><code>  inc-all (Cons e l) = Cons (foo e + 1) (inc-all l)\n</code></pre>\nI'm guessing 'e' is 'element', and lower-case 'L' is list.  Why/when did we switch from 'a' in the definition of List? And where did 'foo' come from?  Is this a builtin function?  A user defined function?<p><pre><code>  map (a -> b) -> List a -> list b\n</code></pre>\nIs the lower case for the last 'list' important?  For that matter, is case important at all in Haskell?  Also, are the types on the left for 'a' and 'b' defined by the given types on the right?  Also haven't figured out why this declaration(?) has no '::' as the others do.<p><pre><code>  dbl-all (Cons e l) = Cons (foo e * e) (inc-all l)\n</code></pre>\nIs that supposed be 'dbl-all' at the end?  And should that be ""2 * e"" instead of ""e * e""? I'm hoping these are typos, otherwise I'm understanding even less than I thought.<p><pre><code>  Note that the first argument is a function, hence the (a -> b) between parentheses.\n</code></pre>\nGreat!  Confirmation on how to read the function declarations.  Now back to reread the first half of the article again.  Hopefully this means the return type is after the last '->'?<p><pre><code>  Very simple, but without the fundamentals I just gave, \n  one hardly stands a chance at deciphering it. \n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately, I still don't feel confident in my ability to decipher now that I have have the been given those fundamentals.  I think a gloss of what 'λe' actually means would help.  As a type, is it parallel to ""void * (* e)( void * )"" in C?<p>Despite this long list, I appreciate that you wrote the article.  Much better to have something possibly flawed than nothing at all.  Maybe one day I'll actually understand it!",1361799242

That the law <i>requires</i> judgements to be rendered in certain terms is not a statement of the legality of making Bayesian arguments.<p>The law requires a <i>decision</i>. The conceptual basis of the common law is a <i>promise</i> that a court will <i>always</i> render a clear and specific set of rulings or orders, and that there will <i>always</i> be an explanation of those rulings or orders. Judges are not free to say to disputants that they are X% likely to win their claim.<p>This is one of those places where Bayesian probability isn't a good fit. Fuzzy logic -- so pass these days -- at least has an understood mechanism for ""defuzzifying"" in a fashion which lawyers would find quite familiar.<p>It also overlooks that judges have many other places to introduce flexibility and weighed judgement. For example, judges may assign blame in portions for some crimes or torts; they may reject, moderate or modify some claims in equity; they have leeway to combine multiple considerations and legislative constraints in handing down criminal sentences and so on.<p>One thing that bugs me <i>tremendously</i> about outsiders looking in at law is the assumption that, since lawyers don't immediately and entirely embrace new idea X, they are fusty old fools who are an impediment to the good. It's an argument born of ignorance that lawyers are deliberately obtuse fools, or judges out-of-touch theoreticians.

The power of this pejorative is that it discounts a theory by attacking the motivations and mental competence of those who advocate the theory. By labeling an explanation of events ""conspiracy theory,"" evidence and argument are dismissed because they come from a mentally or morally deficient personality, not because they have been shown to be incorrect. Calling an explanation of events ""conspiracy theory"" means, in effect, ""We don't like you, and no one should listen to your explanation.""<p>In earlier eras other pejorative labels, such as ""heresy,"" ""witchery,"" and ""communism"" also worked like this. The charge of ""conspiracy theory"" is not so severe as these other labels, but in its way is many times worse. Heresy, witchcraft, and communism at least retain some sense of potency. They designate ideas to be feared. ""Conspiracy theory"" implies that the ideas and their advocates are simple-minded or insane.

She was a suspect because nearly everytime someone died in the hospital she was on her shift.<p>The initial chance of her being present when these supposed murders happened, and being innocent, was estimated at 1 in 7 billion. This number caused the police to focus their research completely on Lucia de B.<p>Eventually she was convicted for the murders based not on hard evidence or witnesses, but on statistics. The chance of innocence was put on 1 in 342 million.<p>The econometrist Aart de Vos was the first to notice that the initial Bayesian analysis was plain wrong. For example they had presumed the murderer had to be found amongst the nurses, other possibilities were neglected. They also hadn't corrected for combined P-values. He reduced the chance Lucia was innocent to 1 in a million.<p>The court said they had abandoned the statistical ""proof"", but remained of the view that it couldn't be a coincidence. Possible murder cases were chosen when they were negative for Lucia, other possible murder cases were left out of the equation. This further reduced the chance to 1 in 50.<p>Statisticians Richard Gill and Piet Groeneboom further reduced the chance to 1 in 9.<p>In my opinion statistics alone can never be adequate for conviction. It can muddy research and lead to confirmation bias. And the difference between a Bayesian chance of 1 in 7 billion and 1 in 9 is so big as to doubt the initial use of statistics even further.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucia_de_Berk#Statistical_arguments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucia_de_Berk#Statistical_argum...</a>",1361798036

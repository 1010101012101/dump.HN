To start off, we are giving you the power to do that.<p>Once this becomes an option (receiving blog posts in print) it changes the way you surf. A 3 page article that looks cool, shelv it and go back to work. Guy Kawasaki interview that you want to read late, shelv it and go back to work. PG essay that you know you want to read again - shelv it.<p>The Internet become about finding great articles, and only reading the short ones.",1190767680

Facebook, just like your silly school book, but online, and you can add friends<p>Google - search engine<p>Yelp - reviews of restaurants and businesses<p>las.fm - music recommandations from your friends<p>pandora - discover music according to your tastes<p>reddit/digg/news.yc -- recommending news and stories<p><p>Yours is not a tangible idea.  Narrow it down to one sentence the main idea, and just one paragrapsh on how it will work, and then you have something more tangible.

59634,comment,59473,59625,0,0,ingenium,,,"Yes, but you can't get into the universities without a good education before that. I work with many people from India from all age ranges, from 22 to their 50s who are all MDs or PhDs, and they all tell me that before a child is even born they have to begin bribing school officials to get them into one of the better schools. This continues every time the child/student goes to a different school until the university level. Without going to a good primary and secondary school, there is no chance of getting into a good university. Even at the university level there is a lot of bribing that takes place.<p>When you have a society where bribing is the norm (nothing is possible without a bribe basically, and even then its not guaranteed), the people with wealth are obviously going to be the ones to benefit most and stay on top. No matter how intelligent, if you don't have the money for the bribes, you can't get anywhere.",1190766114

59625,comment,59473,59621,0,0,juwo,,,"""it is impossible to make it into the best schools without a great deal of personal wealth""<p>you are mistaken. The best Universities are almost free - subsidized by the government. (However in high schools, those that are English speaking Western schools do require wealth). Only brains counts. The IIT Math entrance exam is said to be the toughest in the world (google for past qs papers).

But I have never fully read any of them while I did read Feynman Vol I completely.I feel knuths volumes didn't impact my life as much as Paul Grahams writings on lisp. I am not asskissing. It's a plain fact. <p>Sometimes I wonder if God is not being modest and just being plain with this ""He once told me that his very talent is detail and he didn't consider himself all that brilliant otherwise. He's made it clear that he considers himself less of an innovator than a cataloguer.""<p>I am a math major and I have seen some nasty stuff in my life. Might it be true that people are in awe because no one really understood the terse pages. Another Berkeley's Principles of Human Knowledge? <p>But I am not willing to disregard GOD just yet. If any of you think I am mistaken, could you please leave a comment as to the highlights of Knuths career that one should be aware of. The one thing that I am aware and use frequently is the KMP algorithm.(Which has a K for Knuth in it)",1190765074

Here in India marriage is sky high, yet stressors of any sort are vastly higher.<p>Further, when discussing economic incentives, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to discuss lack of money. Marriage is cheaper than being single due to economies of scale (a lot like having a roommate) and having a more stable income source (assuming 2 earners, it&#x27;s unlikely both will simultaneously lose their job).",1418014689

I&#x27;ll let Slate Star Codex explain (<a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/20/ozys-anti-heartiste-faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/20/ozys-anti-heartiste-faq...</a>):<p>&quot;Is it true that some humans are r-selected, which means they’re promiscuous and want to have lots of children, and some humans are k-selected, which means they invest in a few children?<p>No.<p>For one thing, r/k selection theory was shown to be a vast oversimplification of life-history evolution forty years ago. For another thing, it applies on a species level, not on an individual level. Humans as a species are absurdly k-selected. How many species can you think of that have young that are totally helpless for their first decade of life? r/k selection theory would argue that we wouldn’t have casual sex, because humans are not remotely r-selected on any conceivable level! Clearly, this is not the case, which ought to make one wonder how applicable this is to human beings anyway.&quot;<p>Here is a paper going into the details of the science: <a href=""http://www2.hawaii.edu/~taylor/z652/Reznicketal.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.hawaii.edu/~taylor/z652/Reznicketal.pdf</a>",1418014662

8714963,comment,8713807,8713807,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Different explanation, and some of this ain&#x27;t pretty. (Apologies if this is male-centric, but it&#x27;s probably quite similar for women.)<p>Richer people (or, at least, socioeconomically comfortable people) establish masculinity and effectiveness by building successful families. If you&#x27;re happy at work and your kids are doing great and you&#x27;re intellectually engaged, one woman is enough for most men. That obscene sex drive of the 17-year-old  (that, if it could be realized at that age, would be horrific) is long gone. At 30 with a decent socioeconomic life, you can be satisfied with one woman as long as she&#x27;s basically good to you, because you&#x27;re <i>happy</i> and don&#x27;t need sexual variety.<p>For some men, this isn&#x27;t an option. It might be a lack of long-term, decent employment. It might be a family situation that he can&#x27;t extricate himself from. Or, he might be externally successful and have &quot;the perfect life&quot; from a distance but be ridiculously insecure. Most men who cheat are horribly insecure (which may explain their tendency to &quot;cheat down&quot;). I hate the stud/slut dichotomy because (a) it seems to equate insecurity with moral weakness (and while sexual <i>immorality</i> is revolting, promiscuity isn&#x27;t necessarily immoral, even if unwise for most people) and (b) the truth is that most promiscuous men are just as insecure as promiscuous women, so there&#x27;s no justification for the differential perception of male as victor and female as conquered.<p>If you want to go deeper into the theory behind this, humans actually have <i>two</i> sex drives, one geared toward r-selection and the other toward K-selection. Stereotypically, the r-drive is stronger in the young (15-25) and male; the K-drive starts to dominate at age 18-20 for women and 25-30 for men. The K-drive is the &quot;work hard, build a nest, find one partner you really like, maybe start a family&quot; sexual drive. But if it&#x27;s frustrated due to socioeconomic insecurity, people are more willing to let themselves be distracted by the promiscuous r-drive. This can be OK if it&#x27;s all consensual and no one&#x27;s being cheated on... but if it&#x27;s furtive and dishonest, it&#x27;s awful.<p>This isn&#x27;t about a difference in values between social classes. I don&#x27;t think that there is one. The (small) upper class is its own beast and assessing it would take time from what I&#x27;m trying to say... but the <i>truth</i> about family values is that, from lower to upper-middle class, and in all racial and religious categories, and even between straights and gays these days... there&#x27;s much more variation within categories than between them. The marriage gap isn&#x27;t about a discrepancy in <i>values</i> or &quot;morality&quot; (if that even applies, and I&#x27;m not convinced that it should) but in <i>behavior</i>. We aren&#x27;t more moral than the people in the ghettos. We just behave differently because we&#x27;re under a different and mostly less severe set of stressors.<p>Plenty of people associate wealth with the opportunity toward promiscuity (&quot;two chicks at the same time&quot;) but the empirical facts are that (a) promiscuity hardly requires money, social skills and tactics (&quot;Game&quot;) being more important, and (b) most people who are socioeconomically comfortable have little interest in promiscuity after age 25.<p>Comfortable people (a better adjective than &quot;rich&quot;, because some objectively rich people are financially reckless, uncomfortable, and miserable) are more likely to marry because, with a low level of stress, most people are influenced much more strongly by the K-selective sex drive after age 25 (if not earlier).",1418013961

8714938,comment,8713571,8714566,0,0,jfarmer,,,"For programmers familiar with Ruby or Python, my experience is that the main points of confusion are all around what is happening in memory.  What is a Ruby String/Array/Hash/etc., _really_?  That sort of thing.<p>It might seem trivial to you, but the idea that you have a bunch of 1s and 0s in memory that the computer somehow &quot;knows&quot; is an integer or a character or whatever else is a HUGE intellectual hurdle for people who haven&#x27;t considered it before.  For that reason, I think it&#x27;s a mistake to put a student in a situation where they&#x27;re grappling with both memory and things like calling conventions simultaneously and for the first time.<p>I can&#x27;t comment on Pascal, but I don&#x27;t think C++ is an accurate reflection of the computer&#x27;s own perspective on how work is happening.  The main thing C does is make the way your program interacts with memory much more visceral.<p>There&#x27;s the added benefit that the most popular interpreters for Ruby and Python (MRI and CPython, respectively) are written in C.  This gives the teacher an opportunity to connect concepts in C _directly_ to already-understood concepts from another context.<p>All in all, I think the debate about which language(s) to learn is overstated, albeit one that programmers love to have for tribal reasons.  The same concepts are embedded in all of them in different ways.  The important thing is extracting, isolating, and abstracting those concepts.",1418013421
8714937,comment,8712462,8712641,0,0,timsally,,,"The situation with flying is a bit more nuanced than you make it out to be. I fly to NYC and DC from Boston pretty regularly for business. With TSA precheck and dedicated security lines for the regional shuttles, it usually takes me 2.5 hours total to make the trip. Of course, that requires driving to the airport and taking a cab once you land at your destination.<p>These legs are serious business for the airlines that run them, as compared to Amtrak who isn&#x27;t going to be able to do anything for you if you get stopped due to freight. For example, the flights to these destinations run once an hour. If you show up at the airport before your flight and there is a seat available an earlier flight, the ticketing machine will automatically prompt you to re-book for free. That flexibility is not something you&#x27;re going to get on a train.<p>All of that said, for personal travel I usually take Amtrak. Most people can&#x27;t risk the multi-hour delays that can result from train travel when they are on the clock.

So, this is my general plan:<p>First, assuming I&#x27;m properly entitled to cancel whatever agreement we have, they always get one attempt to play nice and give reasonable notice to cancel by their preferred mechanism. I make a clear record of what happens at this stage, e.g., if I called them then I note the time of the call, who I spoke to, and what was said. Recording the call can be a useful alternative here, but be careful to check what is legal in your jurisdiction before you do this.<p>Second, if cancelling their way fails or proves to be unreasonably difficult, I skip right to sending a recorded letter to their registered address or the equivalent. I explain briefly what happened before, and I state clearly that I am terminating the agreement and that I do not agree to further charges. Always be polite and fair.<p>Third, depending on the amounts of money and timescales involved, I also contact whatever payment services are involved preemptively to make clear that I have not authorised any further payments. Again, keep good records. Alternatively, if I get charged again then at this point I would formally dispute the charge, if necessary providing the payment service with the records to show that I have given proper notice to cancel.<p>If we get this far and working with the payment service(s) doesn&#x27;t get things fixed reasonably quickly, it&#x27;s a case of whether the time and money involved justify proper legal action, and following whatever process is required.<p>Opinions differ on whether to include a threat that further trouble will lead to legal action at the letter stage. Any allusion to a legal action might get bounced directly to their legal department, which is probably better or worse depending on whether you know what you&#x27;re doing and whether they know you know. If they call your bluff and you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, you could wind up spending far more time and money chasing even a simple small claims action than it&#x27;s worth, or more likely giving up and then they know they&#x27;ve won. On the other hand, if you know a friendly lawyer who can spend a few minutes explaining the process and the really important things you need to do without charging you the earth for it, go right ahead. That might include adding certain required information to the letter itself along with a statement that it&#x27;s the first formal step in your legal action, for example.<p>A less dramatic alternative that I&#x27;ve seen work several times is just to add a statement to the letter that you will charge them a reasonable &quot;administration fee&quot; to cover your time and trouble if you have to contact them again due to their failure to comply within a reasonable period. It&#x27;s surprising how many places automatically change their behaviour as soon as something might actually cost them real money, even if it&#x27;s only a nominal amount, and there&#x27;s a good chance that whatever front line grunt first opens your letter won&#x27;t be authorised to deal with that situation so you&#x27;ll get escalated to someone more effective. As always it&#x27;s worth knowing what the law says in your area before trying this one, because you don&#x27;t want to do something dumb that will let them settle for peanuts later if you do wind up spending a significant amount on real legal action that you might otherwise have been entitled to recover.<p>So I guess it comes down to the usual things: Always keep records, always be transparently fair and reasonable, try your payment service&#x27;s dispute process if it&#x27;s a sensible option, and then if things still aren&#x27;t working out, make sure you&#x27;ve taken at least some basic legal advice about your particular situation before you go charging in with something heavier and act accordingly.",1418013176

You can read up about the specifics of different Real Time Bidding exchanges, for example here&#x27;s Google&#x27;s AdExchange protocol: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/ad-exchange/rtb/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/ad-exchange/rtb/</a><p>> How are different websites able to know what content you are interested- who is storing this data on people?<p>The websites that host the actual content don&#x27;t usually care about what ads are being shown to you. They just put code in from an ad exchange and let them handle the rest. The buyers (the ones who run the bidders) are the ones that are interested in figuring out what to show you. For example, many bidders are interested in doing what&#x27;s called Behavioural Retargeting ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_retargeting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_retargeting</a> ). Say you visit a shoes website. Then later you go on Facebook. The moment you go on Facebook, their ad exchange FBX will send a bid request to all the bidders. If the shoes website has partnered with that ad exchange, when they receive the bid request, they can identify you by your cookie, and they can bid and try to show you an ad to get you to come back to their site. Typically a shoes website wouldn&#x27;t have the infrastructure to do real time bidding so they get a third party to do the bidding on their behalf, e.g. AdRoll ( <a href=""https://www.adroll.com/retargeting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.adroll.com/retargeting</a> ).",1418012046

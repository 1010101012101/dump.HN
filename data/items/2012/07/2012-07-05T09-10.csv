If apple not patenting things, someone other does and come back to kick apple in the nuts. Its just one of the many legal capitalism games. Stop the patent laws and nobody does it.

If people know how to use that, this alias is relatively useless unless you want to compose. And even then, you could always compose around the expression, or with a method on the prototype of the result (Number in this case).<p>However, it's very useful to have a curried version of it so that it can be used in filters:<p>[1,2,3,4,3,2].filter($.elem([2,4])); // [ 2, 4, 2 ]<p>This maintains your current javascript indexOf usage, but allows a higher order use that I think should be the default for this function.<p>If you want you JavaScript to look more like Haskell, then your way makes more sense, but having to write Udon.curry everywhere sort of takes away from that cleanliness you are trying to recreate.

Still without any money, this genuine artist (who had ""refused to do two Warhol copies, including forged signatures"", always signing his own name instead on homage pieces) now had a criminal skill that had no other applications.<p>The fact is most people here have had a time in their life when they had unhoned skills (e.g. software/hardware hacking) that, if they only landed the right internship, would become very valuable.  When the police are the proximate cause to creating this ""lucky""  internship (lucky in that the guy had 0 experience with it, or even interest for that matter) to create skills that have only a criminal market [1], something is very wrong.<p>It would be great if Freakonomics covered entrapment some time, as it's very insidious - on the surface it seeems that if you do it you ""would have done it anyway"", but this example shows pretty obviously that this isn't true in any form whatsoever.<p><i>[1] EDIT: or not even a criminal market, as the case may be:<p>""The problem was, Kuhl and his partners couldnt make a deal with anyone.

Probably, it's something related to human nature. And sometimes, it looks like the system is trying to encourage that behavior. We learn of the importance of knowing certain people, pertaining to certain circles, making contacts, grow our social network, and so on.<p>As a simple example, things like LinkedIn are essentially encouraging the use of our contacts, to get an advantage in our professional careers. Doing that in public service, would be unethical (and most probably, illegal). But doing it in the private sector, seems to be fine.
So, that dichotomy blurs as long as it doesn't go too far away. But then, you'll eventually end up in that crony capitalism... unless something or someone stops you. And sadly, the law doesn't seem to be stopping anyone.",1341480702

If people get their training using IDEs and go on to be productive using primarily IDEs, how does being uncomfortable with the command line reflect on their intelligence in any way?<p>Because the common characteristics of such people is to heavily depend on intellisense and auto complete to do almost any task. Tool generated code is so common in those communities most code is generally taken care by the IDE. Import statements, exception handling, try/catch blocks, loop generation in context of previous statements. The list endless...<p>When you are tuned to thinking this way you basically lose any touch on proactive coding. You stop thinking, the IDE starts thinking for you. You stop reading API because you know everything is about to be auto completed, anyway. Now the issue is you are offloading the job of thinking to the IDE. This is dangerous.<p>If a rookie can do what an expert can, just by using an IDE. I guess its time for the expert to fear for his job.<p>Lack of knowledge of command line utils is just one such case. You can either learn how to use awk/sed/Perl + Text processing utils. Or you can open up eclipse and endlessly re implement what the command line has to already offer.<p>When you start looking this from the larger perspective, refusing to learn tools designed to solve a problem in the proper way and taking short cuts, actually makes your life difficult on the longer run.<p>>>Yes, the mundane, confusing use of the git command line is here to stay and the dumb ""actually design and engineer an application"" world of IDEs is going to be replaced by robots. You are a fucking genius. Only on the internet can such backwards and completely worthless logic be said because if you tried to say this shit to anyone in real life you'd be laughed out of the room.<p>Definition of dumb varies. Definition of 'usability' varies. By your definition a programming language could be called dumb, a microprocessor and its interfaces can be called dumb, A pilots cabin and controls can be called dumb(As they are both not easy to laymen, and have never even made progress in that direction). A tool like git is not designed to be a toy or recreation software. Its supposed to manage text/binary versions in situations faced by individuals, small and large teams managing software projects.<p>Therefore it is designed to cover features in that direction, for programmers. Not for your ordinary user who needs to use the ATM to withdraw money.<p>Complaining about command line's usability being difficult is same as complaining about an Airplane's cockpit.",1341479627

For example if digesting a substance the body already manufactures enhances intelligence, it seems likely that it would be easy for evolution to make bodies manufacture more of that substance. I think that is especially true since many substances in the brain are really just (exchangeable?) carriers of information (I am not a medic, though).",1341479518

A sheriffs office incident report said Deputy Randy Graves was on patrol and observed Heil operating an all-terrain vehicle on the roadway and knew Heils license was revoked. Heil was taken to the City-County Jail in Carmi where he posted $150 cash bail. Crystal G.

4202270,comment,4201654,4202099,4,0,notinfinland,,,"No it's not. After the major Obj-C hype on HN I decided to learn it and was very disappointed.<p>1. C compatibility is a liability, not a benefit. Every language that has build on C is full of corner-cases, warts and undefined behavior. Obj-C is the worst since it didn't fix anything about C, it just nailed objects on top of it.<p>2. The syntax is horrible. People rush to say that this is not important, but it's HUGELY important since it's the only way that you interface with the machine, the text that you read and modify for the entire lifetime of the software - which could be years or even decades.
Brad Cox failed to anticipate how object orientation would look like in future programming languages. Most languages either extended the C syntax for the object oriented part or got rid of the baggage. B.C brought us the e-mail symbol and writing + and - in front of all your member functions. e.g:<p>* You have to write @interface and @implementation and @end because apparently it was too much work to write a decent contextual parser.<p>* @""char"" instead of automatic conversion<p>* @ as placeholder in string formatters. I see a pattern here...<p>* You must use () around return types. This is piss poor programming language design: thanks to the +'s and -'s you already know you're looking at a non-C function, but let's make the programmer dance around like a little monkey.<p>* Must use pointer syntax even though you're forced to use pointers to objects anyway. Java and C# got this right.<p>* No operator overloading. Where is your Smalltalk now?<p>* Namespaces?<p>* many other examples<p>Obj-C assumes that it can offload the boring tasks to the programmer because such was the fashion in the 70s and 80s.<p>3. Verbosity does not help at all. You have to spend more time reading code, understanding code, writing code. If it has more LOC, it's harder to maintain, this is a proven fact.<p>4. The type system is as weak as C's, but dynamic typing makes it even more fragile.<p>5. Memory management in iOS is too complicated. Even with ARC you still have to do manual memory management in some cases. The fact that I call retain and release is not much better than calling malloc and free. Heck, it's easy to do similar reference counting in C.
Several studies (please Google) have reported that iOS dev is more time consuming than Android and this matches the reports that I got from companies/people doing cross-platform dev. Obj-C is more complicated to program in than Java, in no small part due to memory management.<p>The final nail in the coffin is that this programming language is all but owned by Apple. The only reason to use it is if you're doing iOS development, but even there we're thankfully starting to see some alternatives such as Ruby and C#.",1341478852

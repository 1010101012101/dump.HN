If it was a typical demand letter, it probably demand not only that they cease and desist from use of the infringing mark, but that they turn over any and all material employing the infringing mark for destruction, as well as a complete accounting of their financial interest in said mark. I imagine Triggertrap&#x27;s legal bill was about 10% for the time to explain &#x27;they&#x27;re right, you&#x27;re wrong, give it up already&#x27; and 90% for the drafting of a reply letter and compliance sufficient to get the injured party to call the matter closed.<p>Now, that&#x27;s a lot to ask for in a letter - usually a Trademark C&D goes along the lines of &#x27;stop or I&#x27;ll sue&#x27; - but in the context of a money-raising campaign, and given the fact that Red Camera company had historically and famously employed the pre-order launch strategy themselves, I think it would have been appropriate to come down on Triggertrap like a ton of bricks. Don&#x27;t forget that trademark law works on a &#x27;defend it or lose it&#x27; basis - if you don&#x27;t vigorously contest infringement of the mark, then some later infringer can raise a defense of constructive abandonment.<p>Not a lawyer, but I&#x27;ve long been interested in this subfield of law.

A good marketer will figure out at what price a device could reasonably be sold for. A good hardware designer could then tell you how close you could come to that, given the desired price point. A number of time folks have come to me with a &quot;really great idea&quot; but when priced out it didn&#x27;t make sense. People just wouldn&#x27;t buy it for what it would cost to make it, and &quot;betting on the come&quot; which is to say making 100,000 to get the price down on the hope that after you&#x27;ve sold 10,000 or so you will be able to sell another 90,000 is a risky business indeed.<p>This though is part of the &quot;nice thing&quot; about Kickstarter. Which is you can set your price point for the quantity of units you offer on KS. Don&#x27;t get funded? Couldn&#x27;t make the market work, get more than you needed? Might be able to add a couple of points of margin to the bottom line. Danger of course is that if you get waaay more than you needed you&#x27;ll be tempted to build V2 right away. Don&#x27;t do that.

I always assumed this happened due to a continuous pressure of magma or something in volcanoes, but it turns out the effect happens regardless of and in addition to any underlying geothermal activity: it&#x27;s a feature of gravity and long-term settling of annular structures.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_crater#mediaviewer/File:Craterstructure.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_crater#mediaviewer/File...</a><p>It looks like this is a crater which has ice(water ice? CO2 ice?) underlying a thick, mobile dust layer.  When Ceres suffered an impact at some point in the past, it excavated a crater in the ice and dust, then the dust settled back down, covering everything.  Over the following millennia / eons, the crater rim subsided and the center entered a long period of slow uplift, pushing through the dust layer and exposing the ice.<p>It&#x27;s possible something more novel could be at work here involving phase changes and maybe cyclical patterns; Unpredicted seasonal geysers have been observed on Mars, as an example.

The reasons are not simply farmers not investing fuel efficiency, or &quot;[not having] the infrastructure in place like the big guys do.&quot; There are cultural aspects arising from the current food supply system that need to be overcome. I&#x27;m in a country (Panama) where most of the population resides in warm (24-32 C all year) areas. Still, except for grains and fruits, the food consumed by the not so rural population primarily comes from the temperate mountains. Sweet potatoes (widely consumed a couple generations ago) can be easily grown anywhere, they are instead mostly imported and not remotely as common as potatoes. The original article does a good job of emphasizing the cultural aspects of local food consumption. That culture still has to develop to the point where consumers expectations are not constrained by the dominant system. As long as local food has to adapt to those expectations, it will be to a considerable extent just an imitation, and indeed an inefficient one.<p>&quot;Society should also consider the economic and social costs of local food systems, which could hold back the growth of developing nations.&quot; That&#x27;s a statement I find particularly puzzling, and that shows the article&#x27;s tendency to base its argument on effects that are not analyzed well enough within the system. The globalized food supply system, has since the Green Revolution, made poor countries become net importers of food. The &quot;successes&quot; have come at great social and environmental costs (ever heard of &quot;Banana Republics&quot;).",1425360658

Too many people are mentoring too many startups. For the entrepreneur or the team you are mentoring the most important thing is bringing your experience to the table. Your specific experience in a specific field, most of the time. There are exceptions, but try to be the mentor of a few set of startups (2 to 4) and focus on them with clear goals also on your side.<p>2 - Real examples (don&#x27;t be vague)<p>Many times after a mentor meeting, as an entrepreneur, you will feel totally lost. You have different mentors and everyone is just telling you different things. You are the one taking the final decision. In this case I usually rely on examples and experiences from those mentors: when you are trying to suggest an option, a specific path or a solution, bring a real example in your conversation. That will create trust and differentiate your opinion from thousands of other comments.<p>3 - Mentorship is a long path<p>The best mentors I had were &quot;following&quot; me. That&#x27;s not having a conversation for an hour or just asking for a couple of suggestions and that&#x27;s also why, as a mentor, you should be super clear on what you expect in return - it&#x27;s just the best way to start that relationship.<p>Just another note. \nMost of the people that used to be my mentors became very close friends. In most cases we used to do business together and the fact I was younger helped me getting the best out of that relationships. If you are doing a startup you should try to work with other entrepreneurs that love to be mentors or at least with people that have been in your position before - that will make all the difference.",1425360550
9136261,comment,9122007,9122007,0,0,jones1618,,,"My theory is that the main difference between acceptance of sex and violence in the media is the &quot;corruption of youth&quot; principle. Look at the history of censorship in America and time and time again there have been crackdowns on movies, pulp magazines, comic books and video games justified by &quot;what about the children?&quot; arguments.<p>Why? Because while excessive violence might inspire violent acts in real life, those acts are already regulated and punished by law. On the other hand, sexual content and (consensual) sex acts depicted in a movie or video game could (oh, my gosh) inspire &quot;immoral&quot; conduct by our youth with no law to hold it in check. That&#x27;s the fear.<p>The best example of this skewing of violence vs. sex is the teenage slasher movie cliche where the horny couple sneaking off to do their thing is almost guaranteed to be the next ones meeting the sharp end of a rusty implement.<p>Face it, we&#x27;re a society that almost fetishizes innocence (moral, physical and mental) and the protection of it. Look at adamant reactions to &quot;free range&quot; kids, teaching of evolution or safe sex, and fear of vaccinations.<p>To be clear, as a parent I believe in protecting my kids&#x27; innocence as long as possible. I also strive to protect them from ugly or gratuitous depictions of any of the traditional sins including greed, gluttony, etc. But, when inevitably reality intersects their growing ability to handle it, I may cringe or cry a little but look forward to the day their innocence is no longer imposed on them but is something they value and choose.",1425360544

Once, someone found a hidden product someone had uploaded as a test: $1500 marked down to $0. It got posted on reddit and hundreds of orders came in all at once. They took the product off their site and canceled all of the orders, but the nastiness and persistence by the people who had placed orders <i>insisting</i> that they <i>deserved</i> this thing for free was mind boggling. There was clearly very little understanding that there were real humans on the other end of this website whose days they were making much more difficult.",1425358821

285156,comment,285122,285122,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"When I was a kid my parents bought a really high quality Atari 2600. And I've got to admit: It works as well today as it did the day we bought it.<p>Other people's high-quality eight-track tape decks, quadraphonic amplifiers, and laserdisc systems are also working fine.<p>My Powerbook G3 ""Wall Street"" was still working great when I sold it. What a tank. Of course, it wouldn't run a modern browser because it still had Mac OS 9... I had tried Mac OS X on it but it was just so <i>slow</i>... and I was never quite able to devote enough time to get Linux working. (PB G3 Linux was always a bit of a delicate hack... and it turns out that if you wait seven or eight years after a machine's heyday the Linux hobbyists have all turned to something else and their pages on installing Linux on the G3 have all gone stale.)<p>The moral of this story is that, while it might pay to throw money at a high-quality vacuum cleaner -- because vacuum cleaners are a relatively mature technology that doesn't change much over time [1] -- in tech the problem is not so simple, because the money you spend on gold-plating may simply be wasted. The baseline is moving too fast.<p>[1] Of course, my father-in-law has an old Electrolux vacuum that still works fine... but I'm an allergy sufferer who prefers a HEPA vacuum, a technology that is now quite common -- it's fully supported by the best vacuums and claimed by every other vacuum -- but which AFAIK didn't exist back in the 1970s. So even vacuum cleaners are not immune to true obsolescence.",1219585730

It's a game of leap frog and we're seeing tremendous results.",1219584912
285149,comment,284192,284513,0,0,unalone,,,"It's wrong when you do it in a weaselly way.<p>The thing that most pissed me off was their ""Firefox vs. Safari"" comparison chart, where Firefox got points in things like ""encourages developing standards"" and a ton of things that AREN'T web browsing. Their marketing has NOTHING to do with how good the browser is, EVERYTHING to do with pure glam. Same with setting a world record. That did nothing to prove anything, nothing to counter the criticism that Firefox was getting for things.<p>And, not to get all fanboyish, but Firefox is an inferior product. Opera is slimmer and faster, and yet can do far more out-of-the-box. On the Mac, as alluded to before, Safari is a godsend. Firefox looks wrong, it's too cluttered, it doesn't support two-finger scrolling well or three-finger navigation at all. And the team almost certainly knows this. Yet they've ignored constantly the fact that they're making an inferior product and continue to market their product as the best there is. Which, at least on OS X, it's not.<p>I think the thing that I like most about Steve Jobs is when, in a marketing interview, he said, ""Apple TV might not work. Other people have tried and failed. There's every chance this will fail too. In which case we'll improve again."" Apple is famous for marketing, but it's famous for marketing in a more honest way: they don't lie about their product. Firefox and its developers do. That's what's wrong with their marketing.",1219584912

285146,comment,283983,284958,0,0,maxklein,,,"Well, you obviously know nothing about that particular business. Let's say an average medical machine like a heart rate monitor - this machine cannot be bought accross most of subsaharan Africa. Even for doctors who have the money, it still cannot be bought, because it's not being sold.<p>Now, one can buy two pieces, put it in your luggage and fly down there. Not as a humanitarian, but as a business man. You can thene easily sell it for twice what you paid, meaning that a doctor now has this machine, and he is saving lives.<p>What YOU don't seem to realise is that this doctor can afford to pay that amount for the machine because he is MAKING A LOT OF MONEY. The reason he buys it from you instead of just flying to the US is that you are OFFERING IT CHEAPER when his flight, transportation and accomodation is factored in.<p>You get it? It's a win-win situation for everyone, it's not exploitation. Exploitation is what you medical companies do when they set the price for medicine at a very high level, even though there is no expense or effort involved in those medicines anymore.<p>So, what's your preference - a city in the 3rd world where there is no heart rate monitor, or a city in the 3rd world where the richest doctor has a heart rate monitor that he paid twice the value for?<p>Because if you were to tell me that I should buy a heart rate monitor and go sell it for $100 profit, I'd say no. It's not worth my time. The same as you apparently, otherwise you'd be out in Africa right now helping out. But you're not.<p>So please don't be a hypocrite.<p>Now, to business. Let's say I want to make money online using the same system as I did above, but with $300 capital.<p>Step 1: I'd find out the most in-demand software products out there<p>Step 2: I'd reduce this software to the simplest possible functionality. I'd pay a software developer to make me this software for $200 (cheap outsourced guys)<p>Step 3: I'd buy a domain and host, and start selling this software. I expect to have about 10 sales a month bringing me $100 extra a month. So after 1 month, I've got $350.<p>Step 4: After a couple of months, I'd repeat the same thing, leading to a second $100 revenue stream. In the meantime, I have improved the reach and features of the first software, such that it is bringing me $200 a month.<p>Step 5: After about 5 months, I should have a steady $600 - $700 revenue stream. I'd save up till I have $2000.<p>Step 6: I'd take the $2000 and clone a popular piece of software, and make it specific to a particular industry for $1500. I'd put $500 in marketing<p>Step 7: The new software should be bringing me a more reasonable income, like $800  a month.<p>Further Steps: I'd just keep repeating, upping the stakes each time. Bigger and bigger.<p>The point is not what you do, the point is that your path has to keep changing and getting bigger and bigger.",1219584528

A patent law office, SETI (really, I was amazingly lucky), SLAC, several software companies.  Without those experiences, I am not sure I would have ever realized that work and fun can be synonymous.

Recently I was selling posters based on a meme unique to my campus -- the designs were our own (so we had the copyright), but the original concept the memes were based on was not. (Imagine you sold a photo of your own cat with the text ""I can haz cheezburger"" -- it's still your copyright, right?)<p>Anyway, some guy started posting that we were fraudsters, were raping culture, etc. It's funny, our troll sounded just like yours -- obviously intelligent and articulate, but took  something trivial (internet memes) way too seriously. I really can't understand the mindset of these people -- when I noticed that reddit was becoming a waste of time, I didn't post a long rant about it -- I just stopped going to reddit.<p>If it's any comfort, know that such people likely have little else going on in their life, and trolling in defence of their online ""tribe"" is all they have.

SQL is a vendor-specific technology, and while it is related to relational databases, is not tied to the underlying theory. You can have a relational database that does not use SQL at all.<p>>  if one claims to be SQL expert with 5 years of experience and don't know what inner join is - he's probably lying.<p>I agree with this.

It's tough work and it gave me some pretty amazing insights into the the justice system and the human condition.<p>In many ways--certainly not all--the plea system benefits the accused. It speeds up the trial, when evidence is lacking the accused tend to get a better result and quite honestly if the evidence is really bad the charges can--and do get dropped. We tend to look at the perverse episodes and not the helpful ones.<p>That said, myself and just about any attorney I know on either side of the bar feels like you'd rather let hundreds of guilty people go free than put one innocent person in jail.<p>I hate that criminal law is so politicized.

How well does a tablet perform when its screen is caked in concrete?</i><p>Repeating part of a comment I made a few days ago:<p>Folks have been talking about tablets being a natural fit for the construction market, and frankly I don't see it (at least for field work). Construction sites are nasty places - dust, concrete, bentonite, slurries, oil & grease, rain, snow, heat these are not good things for an expensive tablet to be around.<p>Furthermore, the trades guys are hard are their equipment. When it's time to go to lunch, stuff gets thrown in the trunk bed or on the passenger seat of the truck as they rush off. Even if a tablet survives the abuse, those guys rarely lock or raise the windows of their trucks on the job, so I wouldn't expect the tablet to be there when the contractor gets back from his break.<p>I think the potential is there, but tablets need to become more ""disposable"" first. On the other hand, there may be decent acceptance from engineers and supervisors.<p><i>Also, it can't be denied that the construction industry is very staid and has much inertia against change.</i><p>I would disagree with that, construction is generally such a low-margin business that (IME) contractors are willing to try new things if it can mean lower bids or higher profit margins.

Which may be OK if the job does not require that, but at least you'll know that about the candidate.<p>Another thing is that some candidates (or their recruiters?) ""inflate"" their resumes claiming expert knowledge for things that they heard about in passing or maybe did some trivial task with it. Asking such trivia knowledge allows to find it out very quickly - if one claims to be SQL expert with 5 years of experience and don't know what inner join is - he's probably lying. And this is a bad sign - to start relationship with a lie.

If there is such a country, please correct meI simply couldn't find one after a few minutes of research.<p>The benefits of vaccination <i>for the receiver of the vaccine</i> are usually enough to entice voluntary vaccination. In fact, I'm sure there are plenty of civic-minded people who get themselves (or their children) vaccinated for the benefit of everyone else, too.<p>The government would only feel compelled to forcibly vaccinate its citizens if people refused en masse to get vaccinated. And <i>that</i> would likely only happen if the cost/risk benefit ratio for getting vaccinated was (perceived to be) unsatisfactory.<p>In that case, do you really want to criminalize honest, well-intentioned people who are abstaining? I'd say nothat'll create a bitter backlash, because these people don't feel like they deserve to be criminals. Instead, you'd want to educate those people and explain to them why it <i>is</i> worth it to get vaccinated (alternatively, if the vaccine really is too risky, you'd want to improve the vaccine). When honest, well-intentioned citizens oppose something en masse, simply making them all criminals for the common good is likely to make them oppose you, distrust you, and listen even less to what you have to say.",1331496572

3691124,comment,3690946,3690946,25,0,someone_welsh,,,"First of all, I should probably disclose that I am a construction industry professional of some sort (architectural training, science training, currently an MEP engineer).<p>Several problems with the article.<p>The ""poor guys in the field"". Who are they? Why have they ""gotten worse and worse""? Have they? (They have a far greater financial interest in improve efficiency than it is for the more ""professional"" end of the construction industry - at least in UK)<p>These ""guys in the field""... something tells me it'll be a while before a main contractor starts giving all his workers ipads.<p>What's the cost per tablet? how many would be needed? How much training in the use of various software would be required? (for people who may not be particularly prone to... using elaborate software). A typical construction worker might work for a main contractor (via various subcontractors) for a total of 6 months. I'm sure they'd be happy to leave with an extra bonus of a tablet after that. How well does a tablet perform when its screen is caked in concrete?<p>Then there's the issue of the software. Some of this ""amazing software"" - (i'm going to pick on Revit as that's what I'm most experienced in) requires a supercomputer to run. If that's how the information is organised, then where is it going to be filtered down to the needs of the contractor in question, (who is ""asking the question of the architect"")<p>(According to the article, Revit architecture = amazing software. This I wholeheartedly dispute. For many reasons, but that's another story)<p>At this point I should point out that the ""much better communication"" bit is quite inaccurate where it details the process of an RFI. For a start - paper is a cheap way for all workers to have the information at hand - ie with them there and then - not in the ""trailer"".<p>Once these over-estimates of the time currently spent are taken out, the two are broadly similar. Replace ""looks at problem and makes notes on plans"" with ""looks at problem, cleans his hands, tries to navigate clunky over elaborate BIM model on underpowered tablet, finally finds relevant part of large and complex building,  annotates it, uploads to central server via wi-fi.<p>The bit about tablets being already massively adopted in construction industry has a link to someone using their ipad  essentially for accounting purposes. Sure. People already do this all the time, with smartphones. Nothing to see here.<p>There's a throwaway comment about green buildings in there as well. To which I say the following:<p>The typical design lifespan of a building nowadays is 40-60 years. What about when they're demolished quicker than this though, perhaps  because they're shit? How green is it to cut costs everywhere to result in a nasty piece of urban fabric which is subsequently destroyed, to be replace, even if it's covered in eco tech? What's the lifespan of a really well considered building which grows and flourishes with the love of those who experience it?<p>Also, new BIM software is often marketed as being able to enable greener building design. My current experience suggests it will be 5 years or so before its even slightly adequate at this. The calculation procedures offered are terrible, constrained and offer nowhere near the flexibility or creativity of a good old spreadsheet. Yet they slow down the spatial modelling process and provide inertia to change, iteration and flexibility. There's a lot to be said for centralising information storage (whilst contextualising it with a 3D model), yet at present this is beyond the practical means of most hardware (I personally doubt this, and attribute it to sloppy/inefficient software design. But this isn't my field  I imagine everyone else @ HN knows a lot more on this)<p>It may seem that I'm an anti tech luddite from this post, but nothing could be further from the truth. I'm reasonably young (late 20s) and generally embrace technological progress.<p>Also, it can't be denied that the construction industry is very staid and has much inertia against change.<p>However, I think that there is a lot of external pressure on the industry to adopt new technologies imposed from outside, as they are ""the future"" etc. In many cases, the technology is not appropriate to the situation at hand.<p>Building design is then adapted to the needs of the software, rather than the other way round. This results in a lot of terrible buildings (which are, it goes without saying, produced cheaply and efficiently). This is a massive shame, as buildings are part of the shared cultural capital of our civilisation and are unavoidable. Just because you don't work/live in a building, it doesn't mean you don't have to experience it.<p>Anyway, that's probably enough for now. I can probably elaborate on all sorts if people are interested.",1331496136

9275919,comment,9275357,9275789,0,0,las_cases,,,"> She completely misunderstood how functions and function invocation work.<p>How can that be? I remember learning about functions such as f(x) = ax + b in the fifth grade if I am not mistaken and learning about functions in programming was extremely natural. I studied programming in high school taken from the very basic and nobody had troubles with how functions worked. It was so math like that it was simply a non-issue. I am really interested to understand what the problem was and how did she figure it out eventually.<p>> And his way of teaching boolean logic is to memorize truth tables<p>But isn&#x27;t Boolean algebra based on exactly that? Isn&#x27;t this the pillar field covered by the mathematical logic, how can it be wrong?",1427461043

9275894,comment,9274047,9275355,0,0,hsivonen,,,"It&#x27;s quite different from innerHTML, since document.write inserts source characters to the character stream going into the parser, and there&#x27;s no guarantee that all elements that get opened get closed. There&#x27;s even no guarantee that the characters inserted don&#x27;t constitute a partial tag. So document.write <i>potentially</i> affects the parsing of everything that comes after it.<p>For this to work, scripts have to appear to block the parser. However, it&#x27;s desirable to start fetching external resources (images, scripts, etc.) that occur after the script that&#x27;s blocking the parser. In Firefox, the scripts see the state of the world as if the parser was blocked, but in reality the parser continues in the background and keeps starting fetches for the external resources it finds and keeps building a queue of operations that need to be performed in order to build the DOM according to what was parsed. If the script doesn&#x27;t call document.write or calls it in a way that closes all the elements that it opens, the operation queue that got built in the background is used. If the document.write is of the bad kind, the work that was done in the background is thrown away and the input stream is rewound. See <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko/HTML_parser_threading"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko/HTML_...</a> for the details.<p>For added fun, document.write can write a script that calls document.write.",1427460495

I recommend to think of ASP (and other\napproaches like CSP (constraint satisfaction problems)) as high-level\nlanguages for solving combinatorial problems.<p>In this understanding,\nhigh-level (ASP, CSP) contrasts with low-level (SAT and SMT) for\nthe same problem domain: just as with high- and low-level\nprogramming languages like Java are compiled down to low-level programming languages like x86 machine code, high-level formalism like ASP, CSP, ... can be compiled down to low-level SAT/SMT.<p>SAT/SMT is the assembly\nlanguage of combinatorial problems because you have to state\nexplicitly all forbidden solutions using CNF (conjuncive normal\nform). For examle if you have variables x, y and z, then the CNF\n   ( x \/ y \/ not z ) /\ ( not x /\ not y )\nhas as models all maps from {x, y, z} to {0, 1} except {x=0, y=0,\nz=1}, {x=1, y=1, z=1} and {x=1, y=1, z=0}. The problem with using CNFs to enumerate forbidden solutions is that the formulae can be long (just like assembler programs can be long). With high-level formalisms like ASP you often get a much more succinct specification.<p>With a\nbit of squinting, you can even see first-order logic as a high-level\nformalism that compiles down to propositional logic (via skolemisation,\nresolution, unification, herbrand etc).",1427459359

I even fact-checked the official motto of Monterrey, and yeah, it is &quot;el labor templa el espíritu&quot;.[1] Quite an obscure fact! I asked my regio coworker, and he had no idea what it was. And yeah, the stereotype in Mexico is that regios are all businessmen, ranchers, conservative, and stingy.[2] Kind of like their neighbours the Texans. :-)<p>Anyway, the thing that struck out to me as a Mexican at the time is that all of the actual &quot;business&quot; was coming from somewhere else. You can read in the article how Guadalajara is a city where a lot of foreign companies host some offices. When I was looking for jobs, by far the most common kind of thing was some local recruiting agency looking for outsourced workers to complement US or sometimes European companies.[3] This bothered me a little because it seemed like the long tail of the colonialism that plagues Mexico&#x27;s history.<p>This is not to say that there are no purely local startups, who are trying to sell locally. Some of the startups mentioned in the article like Métros Cúbicos were already bought by 2011. I myself had a brief stint at a startup that was doing some very interesting machine learning in 2011. My heart wasn&#x27;t in it and I failed the trial period. But I did get to see that it had several local clients, including a major nation-wide cineplex chain. They were also working at the time in growing their business into the US, and looking at their website, it looks like they are succeeding.<p>I had the privilege to work with some very smart hackers, I must say. One of my first jobs was with a company whose local office largely consisted of a band of buddies that knew each other since university and boasted amongst its ranks kernel hackers. The company was actually Spanish (Spaniard), but the Mexican office was quite sizable. Like probably most other countries, the vast majority of tech in Mexico is based on turnkey, replaceable Java-style software developers, but there do exist pockets of great innovation.<p>Ultimately I left Mexico to work at the actual company that I was being outsourced to. Not because I was facing any kind of hardship -- on the contrary, my outsourced salary in the end was quite generous in Mexican terms -- but because I wanted to be where the action was. But if the action is now back in Mexico, I am considering moving back.<p>----<p>[1] <a href=""http://portal.monterrey.gob.mx/tu_ciudad/historia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://portal.monterrey.gob.mx/tu_ciudad/historia.html</a><p>[2] An example of an old Mexican sketch comedy show parodying this stereotype:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI5KLLTfLM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNI5KLLTfLM</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NbJ18S80ig#t=284"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NbJ18S80ig#t=284</a><p>[3] You can see an example of this attitude in Agave Lab, one of the companies mentioned in the article:<p><a href=""http://www.agavelab.com/why-mexico.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.agavelab.com/why-mexico.html</a>",1427457864

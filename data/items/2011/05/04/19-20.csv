Gone.<p>> It's not clear to me why this would follow from a lack of teachers' unions.<p>The union sets up fairly strict protocols that the administration must follow if they want to fire a tenured teacher (the administration can, of course, let go a non-tenured teacher at any time).<p>The school administration is led by the superintendent of schools -- an elected position. The superintendent gets paid a lot of money and wants to get reelected. If parents complain to the super -- and they do -- then the super wants to placate them to ensure reelection.<p>Kids are kids, and they exaggerate (and often lie) to their parents about school. Parents want to believe that their child is telling the truth about mean Mr. Teacher picking on them, being too tough on them, grading them too harshly, or assigning too much homework. So parents quite often complain to the principal (who works directly for the super and is not part of the teacher's union), or even directly to the super.",1304538786

Looking at it, there's a lot of things that need to be fleshed out before it's actually ready.<p>EDIT: The main concern I have over this is that it basically forces a state into an already stateless protocol.  Streams need to be established, which means that they need a state(up/down/in-between), and both the server and client(browser, in this case) needs to maintain it.<p>For example:<p>1.   Should the protocol allow browsers to combine streams?  I.e. if a user is accessing 3 different youtube videos in HTML5 mode, can the browser do 1 stream for the various static elements on the page, and 3 or more streams for the video and other content?<p>This can make the browser feel faster even when loading non-cached pages, so it's definitely desirable.  However, it's a lot more work on both the browser and the server to maintain it.<p>2.  What rules are there for streams?  The draft states that 1 HTTP request and response should be used per stream, but would it make sense to allow the browser and server to assign streams?  How are browser-instantiated streams different from server instantiated ones?  Do those need any additional rules?<p>3.  Should SPDY be content agnostic(where a stream is a stream), or would it make sense to have several QoS levels assigned to them(i.e. high for video or other streaming data, medium for control, low for static elements)?<p>4.(related to 3)  Does HTML, CGI, etc. need to be extended to handle this, or should it be left up to the server/browsers to implement it?",1304538572

Networking/telecom processors, top-end FPGAs, DSPs, and so forth. Is it just that they are at capacity making CPUs and don't see any need to get into that business?

In addition, starting your ads at a lower CPC will get you a lower quality score for your ad -- so even if you get served initially, the life-span of your ad getting served on Facebook will be much less. You will then have to reupload and start spending at a higher CPC much quicker. Of course if you're a small business, starting out at a much higher CPC (>$1) and running a lot of initial volume might not be feasible for most people. You need to start out with greater than .100% CTR if you want to have the ad sustain for a long period of time. Running celebrity ads for a short period of time will work, but you could be looking at C&D at some point if you're running a huge amount of volume.<p>Edit: At the end of the day CPC and CTR are useless if you can't drive enough volume from the ads based on your targeting.<p>Edit 2: Targeting 30+ women will get you a higher landing page conversion and CTR (obviously depends on the vertical, but in general).",1304537632

Follow my reasoning for a minute if that seems like a leap.<p>One of Google's features is that it attempts to build a social graph based on your contacts from its various services.  Have a look at the Dashboard ( <a href=""http://google.com/dashboard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google.com/dashboard</a> ), which tells you what Google is willing to tell you about what it knows.  You may notice a lot of data that you didn't give Google.  Scroll down to the ""Social Circle and Content"" section.  This is the interesting bit:  <a href=""http://www.google.com/s2/search/social"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/s2/search/social</a> .  These are the people you email using GMail, the people you speak to on Google Chat, people you interact with on Reader, Latitude, Picasa, etc.  No big deal so far, until you get to the ""connected accounts"" section.<p>Google will let you connect your Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, etc., accounts to your Google Account.  If you don't connect these accounts, though, it will use what it knows about your social graph to try to find your account.  I discovered this when I logged into my GMail account and made a stop at the Dashboard, to find that it had guessed my Twitter account, and this despite the fact that I had used a different email address and a name totally unrelated to the one I used for GMail.  It did this, apparently, by comparing my social graph to the people I followed on Twitter.  Per Google's help page about this ( <a href=""http://www.google.com/support/websearch/bin/answer.py?answer=1142745"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/support/websearch/bin/answer.py?answer...</a> ), Google finds this out using ""[s]imilarities between your connections. For example, Bob's Google Contacts have names that are very similar to the names of people he follows publicly on Twitter.""  (You'll need to click ""Learn how Google matches an account to you"" to get that text to appear on the page.)<p>Google also does this if you have multiple Google accounts, apparently.  Via <a href=""http://gawker.com/#!5637234"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gawker.com/#!5637234</a> , ""with a friend's consent, he pulled up the person's email account, contact list, chat transcripts, Google Voice call logseven a list of other Gmail addresses that the friend had registered but didn't think were linked to their main account"".<p>So, Google's paying Twitter and Facebook (among others) to scrape accounts, which was big news for both of the social networking sites, especially Twitter, which lacked much solid revenue at the time.  Google keeps a social graph for all of these other sites' users, and compares them to the social graphs of its own users and, if the above quote from Gawker is true, also against its own users to see which Google accounts belong to the same person.  Facebook alone has 600 million users, quite a few accounts to try to match against each of Google's users, and there are a number of services that Google scrapes.  The number of contacts you have (which are shared between GMail and Chat, as well as the partial overlap with contacts in Buzz, Reader, Youtube, and others), 500, 25k, or whatever arbitrary number, take up a negligible amount of storage compared to the amount of processing power and bandwidth required to scrape, build, and compare hundreds of millions (if not billions) of social graphs for accounts across dozens of services.",1304535897

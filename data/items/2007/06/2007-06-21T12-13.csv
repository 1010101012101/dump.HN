Because the logic of the code has already been set, a rewrite of the app in another language should take no more than 2 weeks.

In the article, he cites ""40,000 lines of code"" as something that was impressive to PG in an interview, and then bemoans the fact that they may have to ""throw out and rewrite most of their code"".

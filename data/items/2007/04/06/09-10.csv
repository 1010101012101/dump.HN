I bet that I've spent more than a week's time in the past two years just dealing with these issues on my various sites :(  Part of that is a learning curve but the other part is just the various browsers deciding to implement ""standards"" in unexpected ways (or ignoring them all together).

9549,comment,9348,9348,0,0,bigtoga,,,"I don't know how long you guys have been working from home but I'll provide a little insight from someone who's been doing it mostly for about 12 years. I've been working at home with various projects/jobs since I was about 24 (36 now). For the first 2-3 years, it was all part-time of 2-4 days a week but, for the past decade, it's been full-time. <p>I tell you - even 12 years on, it is still hard to do. I do a lot of traveling  as a consultant and trainer and these are usually Monday through Friday gigs. When I get back to the ""office"" and start to work again on Monday, I've totally lost the groove lol. That's it - it only takes a week of me getting out of the mindset of working at home to lose it. When I come back to the office on Monday, I want to read reddit, catch up on all the stuff I missed and I almost always find that Mondays have a lot of wasted time in them lol. <p>It took me probably 2-3 years initially to get the mindset down and learn how to separate work from play. Distractions are huge at home but, for a 20-something with no significant other, they are less so. Now, I have a spouse and a fun little three year old at home - those are more distracting than all the strip clubs and PS3s in the world lol. But you manage. <p>Last bit - I would suggest that, when you are looking for a spouse/significant other, make sure that person is okay with a comment like, ""Honey, I'm going into work now. I want you to think as though my office is 30 miles away from you and you can't just walk in and ask me a question. Send me an email or phone me if you have a question. Also, don't ask me stupid shit during the day because I'm dealing with complex stuff and inane prattle takes me out of the mindset I need to work."" If you have a great spouse who understands this, you'll be able to work from home much more efficiently.",1175852692

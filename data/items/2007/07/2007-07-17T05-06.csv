Typically you can map such concepts used in one domain onto another domain and leverage them there as well.  <p>I don't see the ""languages"" as being as important or as absolutely dominant over thought as the Sapir-Whorf style arguments imply.  Plus I don't believe the arguments in an absolute, philosophical sense.  And I've seen the argument made too many times in a way that tends to insult some of our fellow programmers for no good reason.<p>Anyway, I think we're probably in agreement about a lot of things but perhaps the Internet is getting in the way of our communication.  Interesting talk, take care and good luck!",1184648684

She makes $70K a year and 0.25% of the company. Eventually, she burns out and goes backpacking in Thailand for a year. Everything tips over, and you need to hire employees 30 and 31. They get paid $170K a year with no equity, cuz they are the only ones who know how to make it all work fast in C++. <p>Of course, employees #1 and #2 wrote the cool algorithm in Python, hired some other people to do the boring stuff, then let those people argue about Java on message forums while they argue about who gets the ""California King"" sized bed in the jumbo-jet. ;-)",1184648529

makes sense. In the more common context of a developer wanting to build a, for example, load bearing calculator for structural engineers, those arguments make no sense.<p>Developers flock to the Market and App Store because they offer two things: discoverability and compensation. Chrome Web Store has tried to be a solution for webapps here, but really those issues still stand for webapps. And to be honest, with the sheer number of apps in the App Store, and Market's search issues, I'm beginning to question whether a discoverability advantage still exists.",1311843511

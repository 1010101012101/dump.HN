4365667,comment,4364370,4364370,1,0,junto,,,"For me personally, college wasn't about academic learning. It was about personal growth and making a lot of mistakes (and learning from them).<p>Before university I programmed for the love of coding. My four years at university ripped the programming soul out of me. A year after university I regained that love again and started learning on the job as an apprentice programmer.<p>Everything since then has been learnt off my own back, via the internet, or from my peers and work colleagues.<p>Education, especially learning how to develop software applications, is not taught well in traditional ""red-brick"" British universities. That may well have changed since my days some 20 years ago, but back then it was all theoretical lectures and very little practice. I was not inspired by anyone nor aspired to become anything better during those four years (from an academic perspective).<p>Don't get me wrong, university isn't a place where you get you should expect to be hand held through your studies. Personal drive is absolutely required. College isn't high school where you get hassled for your home work submissions. However, good mentors and inspirational tutors would have made the whole thing much more attractive.<p>That aside, there is one thing I have learnt that I would happily pass on; it is to never assume someone that didn't go to college isn't as smart as you are. I work with several very smart people. Regarding two in particular, one went to Oxford and the other didn't go to university at all. Both amaze me every day with their abilities to tackle hard technical problems.",1344595850

The selection of tools does not always reflect this immediately though.<p>Also some classification of technology as conservative or liberal depends upon the competing technology it is running against.  I was a bit surprised to see Python classified as liberal - but it makes sense when comparing it to Java.  If it is being compared with Ruby it is very conservative (""do things one way"").<p>There are some non technological risks that influence technology decisions.  Visual Basic may be ""Hardcore Liberal"" from a language perspective, but it is pretty conservative politically (backed by Microsoft, lots of available experienced programmers).<p>Steve as usual has interesting insights.

There's no proof that he even was able to learn the material at all, let alone in an afternoon.<p>This whole attitude that you are above college is just ridiculous.  You get out of college what you put in.  If it's really so easy, and you are so self-motivated, then you would put in your 15 mins a week to get your degree with the understanding of the benefit of the diploma, and then pursue your own self studies / startup / career on the side.  Or if the cost-benefit isn't there you just don't go.  You don't go, and then fail out, and then make excuses about how you were too good for it.  That's not to say you can't game the system what with grade inflation and easy classes, but that's not a true indication of the potential value of college.<p>I found the early CS classes extremely easy as well, you know why?  Because I've been programming since I was 10, so of course the class is going to have to move a little slow to allow beginners to grok pointers and recursion.  It doesn't matter how smart you are, you have to turn it over in your head for a while, which some of us happened to do before college.  On the other hand, by year 3 when I was taking 5000-level Networking, Graphics, and Compilers it was definitely not so easy, and I guarantee neither you nor any of your brilliant friends would be plowing through that material 10 times faster than the course was designed.",1344594648

4365633,comment,4357002,4360762,1,0,tripzilch,,,"Well that probably ties in to how I was taught to ""don't use pure black"" in high school art class: when drawing with India ink and pen.<p>(BTW I just see on Wikipedia that the Chinese paintings you're referring to are quite different, but I'll tell the story anyway.)<p>Most of our drawings would be made of shading, which is done by either cross-hatching or stippling. When you'd need a shadow area to be really dark or ""black"" you weren't allowed to take a brush and simply paint it, no you had to stipple or cross-hatch it until you reached the desired level of darkness. Rather tedious work for large areas and most kids hated it, though I kinda liked ""zoning out"" doing it.<p>And you could tell, too. A properly shaded dark area could be really really dark but always have some white specks in between the layers of cross-hatchings. Very subtle, but it would make it look way more ""real"": we were shown examples of pictures where the darkest shadows (a hole in the wall or something) were painted flat black with a brush, and they'd seem (also literally) ""black holes"". They'd punch right through the image without any sense of depth-proportion. Obviously, because there wasn't any: you can't shade part of a black hole darker than the other bits.<p>Describing this, it makes me think of working with DSP/audio applications. Volume is measured in dB, and if you turn it down, you can go to -36dB or -48dB and it's pretty much ""silent"" (-3dB is half as much power) <i>as long</i> as you play it next to sounds at full volume (0dB). Turn it further down and the software cuts the value to -Inf dB, when there is really no sound (""pure black"").<p>BTW I'm not trying to say that you should never turn a sound all the way ""off"" in an audio mix :) [I'm not a professional sound mixer], just that the concepts seem really similar. In both cases, our eyes and our ears have a tremendous dynamic range, and they are sensitive to ratios, mostly. Using a ""pure black"" paint (I think NASA must have some that comes pretty close) confuses those ratios because it ""divides by zero"", in some sense.<p>Your example of Chinese classic paintings is interesting though, I think it also shows that tastes and customs in painting vary over the ages. The ""don't use pure black"" style is really ubiquitous in current-day digital (web/app) design, but it didn't use to be always like that. Nor is ""realism"" a necessary quality, (Jackson Pollock used pure black and they are the prettiest images before the invention of TV static!).",1344594433

Having state-of-the-art resolution cameras (and audio microphone, in my opinion) in order to capture and transmit back a ""you are there"" experience should be a priority. If it were totally a privately-funded operation, then they can do whatever they want. I understand the desire to have rock-solid confidence in the overal system and it's components, thus testing-fest, thus analysis-fest, thus ultra-conservative instincts. But I'm sure there are ways to, say, isolate a ""higher risk"" component like a modern camera/microphone, and design for redundancy. And if you're going to spend $2.6B you might as well cough up an additional $100M, for example, if that's all it would take to put better, human emo-optimized sensors on there. Precisely because it takes so long and is so expensive anyway. So once it lands there and deploys, you can yield maximum ROI, including emotional/psychological ROI.<p>Anyway, if a NASA operation never gets around to doing such a thing, I bet if SpaceX puts a craft on Mars they'll have the philosophy where they could justify doing it.<p>And this is only a minor criticism on my part. I have massive appreciation for the NASA engineers and team, and what they just accomplished with the MSL landing. I think this issue is just one little blind spot it's easier for somebody outside their org to see and point out. They clearly nailed all the hardest bits of the mission, and ""stuck"" their EDL phase, even though it was so seemingly complex. Between SpaceX, the NASA Mars teams, and Planetary Resources, Armadillo Aerospace, etc. I feel these folks are taking us back to the historical trajectory we all thought we were on as kids. They're taking us back into the Space Age again, leaving the static doldrums of the Shuttle/ISS era.",1344593988

4365609,comment,4365255,4365255,42,0,cletus,,,"As much as some commenters are (weirdly?) railing against this classification scheme I think the underlying idea that software conservatism is about risk aversion is essentially accurate.<p>Perhaps another way of framing this is to ask the question: are you optimizing for the best case or the worst case? This ultimately is a form of risk management. And I'm not talking in the algorithmic sense, meaning complexity expressed as the asymptotically worst case. I'm talking about people, software and ecosystems.<p>Let me illustrate this idea with Java.<p>- C++ has operator overloads. Java does not? Why? Because people might abuse them.  That's optimizing for the worst case (ie bad or inexperienced programmers). Properly used, operator overloading can lead to extremely readable code;<p>- Java has checked exceptions and uses them liberally (pun intended). C#, as one example, only has unchecked exceptions. Why? Philosophically the Java language designers (and many of its users) feel that this forces callers to deal with exceptions. Pragmatically (IMHO) it does not and leads to more cases of exceptions being simply swallowed. But again this is optimizing for the worst case ie programmers who should deal with a particular error condition but won't;<p>- Java has no multiple inheritance. Same story: it can be abused (""it is known""). But also mixins can be a powerful metaphor.<p>- Rinse and repeat for duck typing, extension methods, etc.<p>Putting Python two steps from Ruby strikes me as an interesting choice. I'd say the difference is at most one.<p>I'll also agree that Google as a company (based on my own <i>much</i> more limited experience than Yegge's) is firmly conservative. The style of writing Javascript that he refers to is about writing Google Closure code with all sorts of directives to aid the Closure Compiler (I describe Closure as putting the Java back into Javascript).<p>I also see a lot of Python code that isn't really Python. It's Java expressed in Python syntax rather than idiomatic Python and that is kind of sad.<p>Which isn't to say that any of this is necessarily bad (or good). It's just a (software) political viewpoint you need to be comfortable with (or at least can tolerate) or (to quote the South Park meme) ""You're gonna have a bad time"".<p>One of the comments linked <i>Worse is Better</i> [1], which is worth a read too.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs240/readings/worse-is-better.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs240/readings/worse-is-better...</a>",1344593380

4365606,comment,4365255,4365255,32,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think I'm a software libertarian.<p>If you like dynamic typing and can write good, legible code in a language like Python or Lisp, do it. If you like static typing, knock yourself out. If you want to use an IDE, go for it. If you want to use emacs, do it. Hell, if you like object-oriented programming, try it out. I think 95% of ""object-oriented"" programming (as currently practiced) is junk, but the other 5% is legitimately valuable. If you have the taste to pick from that 5%, go ahead.<p>What you shouldn't have the right to do is impose complexity on other people. Use whatever environment you like, but if your code depends on your environment, that's bad. If people can't get work done because they're cleaning up your messes, that's bad. Be as liberal and as kinky as you want in your own sandbox, but don't impose your wacky, untested DSL on everyone else.<p>That said, I like statically typed languages. ML is the only language I've encountered where reading average-case code is enjoyable. (Scala's a great language, but average-case code is ugly due to the Java influence. There's a fair amount of spaghetti code written in it due to the cultural legacy of the SpaghettiFactoryFactory Java culture. I can't speak for Haskell because I haven't seen enough.) I think that's neat and very rare in the programming world. How much code is enjoyable to read? 1 percent, maybe? In Ocaml, that number is a lot higher. Probably around 50%. 50 percent of Java code isn't even <i>legible</i>. Being able to actually read other peoples' code is nice, and it's one thing I miss about working in Ocaml.<p>I'm probably more in line with the hard-line conservative camp in terms of my view of complexity: avoid it unless you need it. The Unix philosophy works. Religious X-oriented programming doesn't. Big Code leads to fail. Small-program methodology's little programs (Unix philosophy) are written to solve problems: do one thing and do it well. Ambitious projects should be structured and respected as <i>systems</i>, not all-or-nothing, massive single-program megaliths with no clear communication policy among modules. Small-program development works. Big Software is written to get promotions. That produces the next generation's legacy horrors. Also, structuring your company around 17-day ""iterations"" is stupid. Et cetera.<p>I also tend to think that a lot of the features that scare typical software conservatives are genuinely worthwhile. Macros in Lisp are important and can be very beneficial-- if used conservatively. Cleverness for its own sake is bad, but there are times when macros are very useful. Document what you're doing, and make sure it's tasteful and makes sense before you let anyone else depend on the work, but go ahead and do it. I wouldn't have learned what not to do with macros had I not made a few mistakes when I first encountered them.<p>So, with a mix of opinions from the ""conservative"" and ""liberal"" camps, I can't say where I fall. I like macros (when used by disciplined people) but I also like static typing. Both turn out to be very useful tools. Consequently, I find that I like a lot of different languages and insist not on a specific one, but on small-program methodology so that people can use the right tool for the job.<p>I'm conservative because I dislike complexity (I think ""software liberals"" are OK with complexity as long as it's under the hood-- most metaprogramming involves extremely complex solutions that, when they work and the abstractions don't leak, although this is rare, allow clean interfaces-- whereas I'm not comfortable making that distinction) but I (a) understand that liberalism is essential to driving innovation, and (b) can't classify myself as a conservative because management is inherently conservative and is, in software, almost never the solution to the problem. Usually, it is the problem. Most companies fall to shit not because they have some difficult code-- every codebase has some crap in it-- but because management mandates that they use the bad code (often for political reasons, like the original architect being a crony of the manager) as-is instead of taking the time to understand or replace it. I'd like to see how Valve evolves over the next 5 years, because I think management in software is usually a source of undesirable complexity, rather than the safeguard against complexity that it thinks it is being. If Valve can give us a determination either way on whether software can work without managers in the first place, that'd be incredibly useful information.<p>Not surprisingly, software politics also has a lot of individual inconsistencies and hypocrisy. Corporatism (in politics, not software) is neither socialism nor capitalism but a system designed to give the best of both worlds to a well-connected elite and the worst of both to everyone else. (Consider air travel as a microcosm: Soviet experience and service quality and comfort, mean-spirited and capricious-- but very capitalistic-- pricing.) I think the same exists in software politics and the typical managerial conservatism. People and organizations can identify in name with liberalism or conservatism, but tend to pick and choose as suits them. (For an example of this inconsistency: Google, a bastion of software conservatism, allowed GCL to exist.) What makes 90 percent of software jobs so fucking miserable isn't those rock star, ""undisciplined"" Rails liberals or stodgy gray-haired conservatives. Rather, it's a corporatist ""crony capitalism"" state where people who win managerial blessing get liberalism (i.e. the autonomy to do whatever they want and freely impose complexity downstream) while the rest of the drones get stonewalled with a supposedly stiff-lipped conservatism (e.g. ""you can't [fix that codebase | use that language | pursue that side project] because we can't afford the risk"") that is presented as principled, although the drones see managerial favorites getting through that wall on a daily basis, so they aren't fooled.",1344593230

Those will just schedule the coro in their own scheduler, and perform the read again and continue.<p>>> Alternatively, we could just yield the coro, waiting for a new special coroutine that would run in a background thread just executing readahead() and then re-scheduling(making runnable) the original coro, waiting for readahead.<p>Seems to me this scheme will ultimately be limited by the slower request. Performing fast and slow operations is essentially Little&#x27;s Law[1] where the average time dominates.

9254457,comment,9245980,9252807,0,0,cesarb,,,"That was a long time ago, so my memory is a bit hazy on the details. If I recall it correctly, it was the laptop I was using at the time, and I almost always powered it off when leaving work. I still have another laptop of the same set at work, so I could look up the exact model tomorrow if you want (it&#x27;s an old Dell Latitude IIRC).<p>But I can clearly recall that I thought at the time precisely that: &quot;how is that even possible, powering off the laptop should have cleared the video memory, and this laptop didn&#x27;t have a Windows install for years!&quot; Yet, there it was, a Windows desktop with one window (or dialog, can&#x27;t recall precisely) open. (I don&#x27;t recall how I knew it was from its old Windows install; it might have been showing some work-related information.)<p>It wasn&#x27;t the screen saver; IIRC, I used the &quot;blank screen&quot; screensaver (or some other equally simple screensaver), not a &quot;slideshow&quot; or &quot;random&quot; screensaver.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s hard to believe. I myself would have found it hard to believe if I hadn&#x27;t seen it. I even took a photo, but it was several mobile phones ago, so I&#x27;d have to search through my old backups to see if I can find it.<p>The only explanation I could come up with was that the video memory on that laptop for some reason retained its contents as long as the laptop battery wasn&#x27;t removed (while the laptop had been powered off many times, its battery had not been removed), and the Windows driver used the video memory in a different way than the Linux driver, so that desktop snapshot never got overwritten. Then one day a glitch made the &quot;read the screen contents from here&quot; pointer point to it, and so it showed in the screen. It&#x27;s ridiculously unlikely, but I couldn&#x27;t come up with a better explanation; it&#x27;s even more bizarre in that the &quot;ghost&quot; image was perfect, with no visual glitches.",1427162077

This also accounts for a difference in design style between PC games and their console equivalents, where PC stuff tends to incorporate deeper simulation aspects with more persistent data being tracked, because there&#x27;s some extra room for that stuff, while console games are forced to be &quot;lean&quot; with most of their memory dedicated towards the assets while the stats and save data are relatively light.<p>Like everything else, this has changed as we&#x27;ve gotten closer and closer to photorealism and games that are glorified tech demos constitute less and less of the overall market; the current generation consoles have substantially changed their profile to generalize and be more like PCs - the 360 had only 512MB at a time where gaming PCs were going for 1-2GB, while Xbox One and PS4 are roughly in the same ballpark(5GB and 8GB) as current-spec gaming PCs.",1427161952

A big part of why I enjoy thinking about historical problems so much is that it&#x27;s virtually impossible to supply a definitive explanation for anything (we&#x27;re still arguing over the Roman empire&#x27;s demise one and a half millennia on). I think the author&#x27;s point - or at least the stance I take, which I suspect he aligns generally with too based on his work - is that quantitive data can only be used in historical arguments in what is effectively a qualitative way, i.e. as part of a larger, holistic assessment based on many perspectives rather than as a definitive &quot;proof&quot; of anything. But it&#x27;s an exciting addition because historians typically haven&#x27;t taken this approach at all prior to the last decade, excepting some forays into punchcard computing in the 60s and 70s by people like Lawrence Stone and the Annalists.<p>Incidentally, I&#x27;d point to Pinker&#x27;s &quot;Better Angels of Our Nature&quot; book as an example of the risks of putting too much stock in a scientific/econometric approach to history. I actually think his argument is (in broad outlines) convincing, but the way he marshals his evidence drives academic historians crazy because it ignores that history is a complex system, as you say. (i.e., he does things like saying &quot;x tribe in New Guinea is a &#x27;stone age&#x27; tribe and according to one or two studies has a high murder rate, therefore all humans in &#x27;the stone age&#x27; had a murder rate comparable to that tribe.&quot;)",1427160123

The exercise the author engages in here, of &quot;making sense&quot; of two contradictory datasets can be done with almost any phenomenon.<p>The more systematic and inclusive data gathering is, the more strongly any explanation is going to be tied to the phenomenon it is going to explain, and historians--like any science--should always be asking themselves, &quot;How can I test this explanatory idea? If it is true, then what else ought to be true?&quot;<p>Otherwise, when you &quot;explain things a lot&quot; you are doing <i>nothing</i> but generating noise. The financial press provides strong evidence for this: tens of thousands of words of &quot;explanation&quot; every single day, and not a single person made rich by any of the predictions the same people make. When you can explain everything and predict nothing, you had better be able to test your explanations by indirect means <i>if you want to be taken more seriously than a fabulist</i>.<p>The latter part is important: historians and others like them expect us to take their pontifications seriously. But we know the untested explanation is almost certainly nothing but a confabulation. So why should we take anything historians say seriously?<p>The history of science--which I define inclusively as &quot;publicly testing ideas by systematic observation, controlled experiment and Bayesian inference&quot;--is one of realizing we&#x27;ve been doing it wrong, that ideas we believed and took seriously were actually rather silly. Blood circulates. Geese don&#x27;t come from barnacles. Bad air or moral turpitude don&#x27;t cause plague. And so on.<p>If historians are starting to ask, &quot;Are we doing this wrong?&quot; that&#x27;s a good thing, and based on my understanding of what science is and how it works I <i>predict</i> that over the next few decades the &quot;digital humanities&quot; will make a lot of traditional beliefs look untenably foolish, and there will be a general shift of the field toward Bayesian methods that will alienate and annoy a great many people whose freedom to confabulate will be greatly curtailed. It will change the face of the humanities to the extent that they will have as little to do with their historical roots as modern psychology has to do with the story-tellers of the early 20th century who gave it its start.",1427160059

History&#x27;s underlying mathematical assumption -- an assumption that is almost surely correct -- is that society is a complex system, and therefore cannot be subject to predictions (or very few, qualitative predictions) in the long run. If historians feel quantitative analysis gives their explanations any sort of definitiveness (and &quot;proving&quot; the inevitability of past events is exactly the same as prediction), they will fall into the same trap as economists.<p>A different perspective -- absolutely; a quantitative <i>theory</i> -- no. In fact, quantitative theory, at least in a sense similar to physics, is nearly impossible even in subjects that are much closer to physics than history. The simplest non-linear differential equations defy quantitative study, and history (and even economics and biology) are nowhere near simple.<p>However, it is possible that even in a complex system, there should arise some temporary structures that can be described as linear processes, and therefore subject to some quantitative theory, but it will be short lived. Complex systems undergo phase-changes that tend to break and reform any structure. On the other hand, it can be argued that those phase changes are rare, and that human society is self-stabilizing on some global scale, so that the system -- at least for the moment -- is stable, and some quantitative analysis may apply. But I&#x27;m pretty sure no one would classify any <i>specific</i> society (i.e. a small subset of humankind) as stable.",1427159472

1550188,comment,1549860,1549860,0,0,_delirium,,,"Most of this article is pretty good, but it mostly isn't about any sort of relationship between high-speed rail and freight trains. That comes in only at the very end of the article, and is quite speculative.<p>They admit that the <i>current</i> batch of high-speed rail lines being built, mainly California's, will run on new lines that won't interfere with freight. The <i>Economist's</i> worry seems to be about the more extensive proposed high-speed rail network that's currently on the drawing board, which is proposed to include extended portions on existing freight rails (at 110mph) to link together the purpose-built higher-speed segments. They seem to be thinking of plans like this one: <a href=""http://www.fra.dot.gov/Pages/203.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fra.dot.gov/Pages/203.shtml</a><p>But is that really even a medium-term worry? I'll be surprised if even California's line gets finished by 2020. I would be <i>very</i> surprised if this more extensive national HSR plan that's supposed to follow later gets anywhere anytime soon. The map linked above is the result of a process begun in 1991, which has not been turning into a high-speed-rail network at any particularly great rate of speed. It'll be a miracle if they settle on a final plan by 2020, much less fund it or actually start building anything. I'll eat my hat if that entire network is built in my lifetime!",1280203033

An action in a Facebook game might invalidate a page for 10 or 20 or 50 users. An upvote, (or a comment, or an edit, or an upvote on a comment) invalidates that page for upwards of 300k+ users. Combine that with the rate at which reddit's pages change, and you're talking an obscene amount of CPU time spent building fragments/pages to stick into your cache. Scope of visibility of a change means a lot.<p>You obviously know how to scale an app if you were pulling 16 million pageviews a day, and I don't intend to discount that at all.

1550162,comment,1549363,1549363,0,0,smakz,,,"Very interesting essay. Internet addiction is in my opinion spreading like wildfire, spreading well beyond procrastination as Paul Graham said and actually impacting workspace and home environments extremely negatively - the analogy to alcohol is spot on. You aren't procrastinating, you are the equivalent of drunk.<p>Introspectively, the problem with my addiction lies in the acceleration of production as well as distribution. There are more movies being produced, more novels being written, and more content in general to consume. Technology has been making producing these mediums easier and easier. Musicians used to have to write down lyrics and notes on paper - now there are programs which can practically generate a whole song for them. News can be written by your friends who just got the latest scoop at a major conference. Producing content has never been easier.<p>At the same time on the distribution side, the internet has made all this content available at your finger tips instantly. As bandwidth increased, it became almost too easy to spend 10 minutes watching news or entertaining on YouTube or a myriad of other free media streaming sites.<p>These processes will only get more efficient and more effective. As a corollary, the media which seems highly targeted and interesting to you will become increasingly prevalent.<p>There are no easy answers, and I for one am taking the issue relatively seriously. Getting away for extended periods of time without internet is vital - which is also why I don't own a smart phone.",1280201721

Does Reddit find things only specific to your account and show you a list of friends and their content you are allowed to see (or even something vaguely similarly complicated)?

1550115,comment,1547205,1548550,0,0,isamuel,,,"I'm not so sure about this—the ""unpaid debt equals destroyed wealth"" part. It's important to be concrete about what we're talking about here. A society's wealth can't be sensibly measured in money, because currency is just a neutral medium of exchange having no intrinsic value. Central banks control its supply in an instrumental way. This is monetary policy 101. I trust we agree.<p>So what happens if you lend me $1 million and I don't pay you back because my business goes belly-up in a month? Well. No actual wealth is destroyed if you don't get paid back. Whatever you created (a business, a book, whatever) to get so rich still exists, and society still enjoys its benefits. You say that well, it could have been invested elsewhere; there's an opportunity cost. But assuming relatively fluid capital markets, someone else likely invested in whatever you didn't invest in, and so whatever great thing was created by that other business still exists.<p>Now, sometimes you have situations where no one trusts anyone to pay back their debts, and you have frozen credit markets. We saw this during the financial panic of 08-09. But the problem there is that real stuff---factories, people, stores---sit idle because capital markets are necessary for this stuff to function. The problem isn't that ""lending isn't happening,"" the problem is that a society has a massive amount of idle stuff that could be otherwise productive, sitting around wasting away for no good reason.<p>I'm not sure I even disagree with you, I've just been trying to think through these issues in a non-abstract way.",1280200054

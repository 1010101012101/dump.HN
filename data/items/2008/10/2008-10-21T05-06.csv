It was good advice, but the sheep only heard “generalist”. These days there’s loads of programmers who know a bit of everything. Which is good, but they aren’t deep in anything. They keep selling the idea of knowing a little of everything as a good thing, because they are a generalist. I’m not buying.<p>I prefer to compose teams of true specializing generalists. For example, if I’m building a Flex front end over a RESTful Rails application, I want everyone to be familiar with Flex, Ruby, ActionScript, REST, SQL, etc. But, I also want at least one team member to be deep with each of the key elements. I’m talking seriously deep. I want them to be so deep that they annoy the team with their “too detailed” explanations of what’s going on and what needs to be done. Those guys drive innovation in their area of expertise, and the app is significantly better because of their low-level understanding.""",1224567878

Assuming you are drawing a decent salary in the United States this effectively doubles your salary. Would you sell your left-you-know-what for a job that doubles your salary?<p>Some context: I make over 100K US $ (and that is in India. Expenses are much lower here, than say in Silicon Valley. I have many friends who make similar amounts of money).<p>I wouldn't automatically accept  a job at  Microsoft just because they double that amount, <i>especially</i> if the alternative is working on an idea/code base I love full time. I could live on about a 1000 $ after taxes (I am single and have no debt)  if I were working on something world changing with brilliant people I respect and can learn from.<p>I am sure I am missing something. maybe the payout is 300 K US $ / year? (though it doesn't read that way) That is more tempting to be sure. Even for that amount I still wouldn't give my left-you-know-what :-)",1224566217

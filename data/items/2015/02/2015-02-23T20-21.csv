There&#x27;s currently a fixed quota, with two things that go into allocating it: 1) offers not paying the &quot;prevailing wage&quot; are disqualified; and 2) the remaining offers are allocated in first-come, first-serve fashion until the quota is reached, with no preference to good vs. bad offers.<p>Seems you could collapse those two issues by just saying: the 50,000 slots (or however many there will be) are auctioned off, or allocated in order of highest salary offer, or something similar. In theory the &quot;invisible hand of the market&quot; ought to then allocate the slots to where foreign talent is most needed, and the companies using it for cheap labor won&#x27;t be able to outbid Google/etc. for the slots.",1424725159

So?<p>> And you know the JVM ran in the browser almost 20 years ago,<p>And it did such a good job that everyone has been prefering java applets to html/js/flash for those 20 years.<p>Oh, actually, they didn&#x27;t. In fact, with few exceptions, they have been rejected by users for most of those 20 years. The implementation was horrible. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s better today - maybe it is for some Windows browsers. But no browser on my Mac or Linux supports it without an external install -- and last time I actually used it (~2 years ago), it <i>still</i> took forever to start applets.<p>It might have worked if the execution was acceptable; it&#x27;s not impossible - flash had reasonable execution which lead to widespread adoption that is still nontrivial despite a big part of the web - that of mobile - made it unusable. And yet, 18 years later (I&#x27;m up-to-date as of 2 years ago), Java applets are still a mess.<p>So, the bottom line is: who cares the JVM ran in the browser?",1424725132

9096979,comment,9096321,9096321,0,0,AshleysBrain,,,"This is very cool, and great to read more interesting research from Mozilla. However in this article I notice something curious: normal asm.js kicks off and shortly after reaches top speed by around 700ms. emterpreter gets going by 200ms, but takes another 1200ms to reach top speed by 1400ms. Why is it not another 700ms? Isn&#x27;t it just doing the same work as asm.js but in the background while running with emterpreter?<p>Non-blacklisted emterpreter looks slow enough (5fps ish on that graph?) to simply not be useful for some use cases, like a game engine - it&#x27;s not going to be remotely playable like that. Therefore emterpret => asm.js actually significantly increases the startup time. Playable by 1400ms is worse than playable by 700ms.

In general, H1 and L1 visas are among the only way for people from outside of the NAFTA trade zone to seek employment-based entry into the US. There are other visas like O visas (typically used by people with extraordinary talents) or refugee visas and the like, but those are generally not applicable to your candidates.<p>If you want to hire Canadian (or possibly Mexican) citizens, they do not need a visa to work for you. You can instead sponsor them to obtain a TN (NAFTA) work permit. These permits are somewhat easier to obtain because there is no lottery, no cap, and no window of opportunity effect (The H-1B visa cap is generally filled within the first moments of April 1st of every year). Since a TN work permit is not a visa, it doesn&#x27;t lead to permanent residence.

Without Russian military presence any attempt at the vote would be bloodily squashed  by the [Western] Ukrainian volunteer battalions.<p>>>Kiev&#x27;s &quot;pacifier&quot; operation<p>>I have no knowledge of this.<p>It is what officially called &quot;Anti-Terrorist Operation&quot; that is happening in the Donbass.<p>>I do remember that Ukrainian paras and LEOs cracked down on extreme [Ukrainian] nationalist in the Western Ukraine before they began the fight against the Cossack invasion<p>A creature of Hell - Sashko Bilyy - was killed in pretty strange situation. Even Ukrainian nationalists finally decided to stop being publicly associated with the river of blood and torture he was leaving in his wake.<p>>>Do you support Palestinians, Tamils, Uyghurs, Kosovars right to self determination? I am not an advocate for mass slaughter. I firmly believe in equal representation. Partitioning countries by ethnic division is the fast track to both.<p>yes, i do. As Eltsyn said in 1991 when USSR was breaking up - &quot;Take all the sovereignty you&#x27;re able to carry away.&quot; Unfortunately, this short period of bloodless (or low-bloodness)independence getting was more of exception in the world rather than rule.<p>>It seems very clear to me that Russia is backed into a corner. They have a dwindling, ignorant population obsessed with decadence. The have a poor geographical position. They have severe cultural divisions.<p>it is pretty typical situation for Russia.<p>>Hilariously, it seems to be working so far.<p>will see. Falling of oil prices was a nice punch that Russia still need to live through. Last time it happened - mid-198x - the USSR went down like in boxing knock-down.<p>>The only thing that stands in the way of Russian Gangster Ascendancy is a German Army with U.S. equipment. Putin knows this. I have no faith in my Nation&#x27;s wherewithal and resolve. 4000+ KIA in 10 years has nearly broken our military; how can those weaklings go up against a country more willing to slaughter their children and burn their livelihoods instead of retreat? Bully tactics work on the US and most of Europe. Germany and Scandinavia, less so.<p>If you look at the actual fighting in Donbass you&#x27;d notice that Russian military isn&#x27;t very effective as a whole system. Of course, having nuclear ICBMs Russia thus willn&#x27;t be made subject to &quot;pacifying&quot; invasion from NATO, yet Russian military also in no condition to effectively fight a high-tech force of NATO. Bully tactics works because NATO doesn&#x27;t want any war, successful or unsuccessful, because peaceful life is that much better and cost effective. Putin&#x27;s regime on the other side is under huge stress, economical and political, and &quot;small victorius war&quot; would seem like a miracle medicine for it. Like with other similar regimes in similar situations such war somehow just doesn&#x27;t materialize (Falkland war comes to mind). Nevertheless, when Ukrainian nationalists took power in the coup and couldn&#x27;t force themselves to work through the main course - buildup of economy and army - and instead went straight for the desert - solving &quot;issue&quot; of ethnic Russians - it was an opening Putin couldn&#x27;t resist. It was his wet dream come true. The bloodless takeover of Crimea (with full support by the majority of the Crimea population, technical/procedural issues with the referendum  be damned :) shot his approval rating into stratosphere ... Well, despite it looking like a &quot;miracle medicine&quot;, such actions have only short-term effect of opiatic pain-killer with real problems staying unsolved and only going worse... So, more pain-killer is in order...",1424724728

For the the last year and a half I have been working as a DBA. I decided to take that job because it was a small start-up, that was just starting up, and it look challenging to do that sort of job. Start-up is economy oriented so do a lot more than just DBA, I do a bit of programming but not much.<p>Now I&#x27;m 27 years old, that start-up is falling apart due to bad management. I work for a lousy pay-check which is often late. I have no opportunity to learn from someone on my job, so everything I do I do it alone. And I often have to do it in a really short amount of time, because everything is always needed &#x27;yesterday&#x27;. I manage to make it work, but quality of my work is just bad. Yea the database works, my code does the job, but I would not like for someone to actually see it.<p>And right now I have no idea what to do. I used only 20% potential that year and a half I spent on that job. And I feel like I&#x27;m behind. 
I really like programming and I would like to get back into it. So does anyone have any useful link or resource or guideline how can I brush up my programming skills. But not only basic programming and algorithms, but also good programming practices, clean code, etc. I would mainly focus on JAVA and Android programming, maybe I would start learning Python OR Ruby (I see it is very wanted on the job market).<p>I live in a 3rd world country, which sometimes feels like like it is a 7th world country.

I can&#x27;t stop myself for thinking about work problems from bleeding over into my personal time.

Since packets with particular ports/IPs/etc tend to cluster in time, there&#x27;s a good chance that at least a few will take advantage of disk caches.  Even if we clear the disk cache before the query, the first packet read can cache some read-ahead, and a subsequent packet read may hit that cache entry without requiring an additional seek/read.<p>As far as compressing offsets, I haven&#x27;t done any specific measurements but my intuition is that snappy (really any compression algorithm) gives us a huge benefit, since all offsets are stored in-order:  they tend to have at least 2 prefix bytes in common, so it&#x27;s highly compressible.<p>I experimented with mmap&#x27;ing all files in stenographer when it sees them, and it turned out to have negligible performance benefits... I think because the kernel already does disk caching in the background.<p>I think compression is something we&#x27;ll defer until we have an explicit need.  It sounds super useful, but we tend not to really care about data after a pretty short time anyway... we try to extract &quot;interesting&quot; pcaps from steno pretty quickly (based on alerts, etc).  It&#x27;s a great idea, though, and I&#x27;m happy to accept pull requests ;)<p>Overall, I&#x27;ve been really pleased with how doing the simplest thing actually gives us good performance while maintaining understand-ability.  The kernel disk caching means we don&#x27;t need any in-process caching.  The simplest offset encoding + built-in compression gives great compression and speed.  O_DIRECT gives really good disk throughput by offloading all write decisions to the kernel.  More often than not, more clever code gave little or even negative performance gains.",1424724046

ConsoleKit is unmaintained and broken) and the correct reaction would be to fix the issue (eg. like the ConsoleKit2 people are trying to do) rather than forking Debian just to ignore the issue.<p>Not that forking Debian is bad and people should not do it for whatever irrational reason if they want: it&#x27;s just that in this case there&#x27;s no rational reason the same task couldn&#x27;t have been carried over in Debian itself other than the fact that in your own fork you may accept lower quality contributions more easily.",1424723725

9096831,comment,9087819,9090194,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"I had Platinum and the option of the Centurion (black). People I know with Centurion cards actually just don&#x27;t use them that much after an initial &quot;fun&quot; period of showing off. Using them at clubs, for instance, is just a great way to get extra charges thrown in, since people will guess you aren&#x27;t carefully reviewing your statement and have extra money.<p>OTOH if you don&#x27;t mind coming off as a dick, you can pull out a Centurion card and try to bully/bluff people with a &quot;don&#x27;t you know who I am&quot; kinda deal. Though I did love the one time a friend tried this and the clerk just laughed and said &quot;we don&#x27;t take Amex&quot;. Also, other banks are issuing &quot;Black&quot; cards so there&#x27;s a lot of people trying this not even being Amex holders.<p>Centurion used to come with more benefits, but they&#x27;ve been pulling them back and making it more of a show-off &quot;I&#x27;m so elite&quot; kind of thing. (A big blow was losing Continental elite status, since United is Chase&#x27;s bitch.) They&#x27;re building out airport lounges now to help compensate. And in Toronto Pearson, because Canada is just so incompetent, airlines don&#x27;t have faster lines for security, just Air Canada and Amex. Rather annoying if you&#x27;re a United 1K or otherwise paid for first class. That&#x27;s probably the only reason I&#x27;d consider getting an Amex card again.<p>Nowadays, even random VISA cards will have concierge services, because it&#x27;s fairly cheap, underused, yet makes people feel special. And for the cost of a Platinum card ($495 for primary, then $195 I think) you can use a lot of other services. And Centurion cards were $5000/$2500. I think you could just carry $5000 in cash and get the same kind of &quot;respect&quot;.<p>(I haven&#x27;t used Amex in years. Despite paying on time, always, and having a runrate of over $250K a year, they did a financial review, requesting my tax/employment records. I told them to fuck off and that was that.)",1424723687

But I&#x27;m really curious: That performance is a bit beyond the spec&#x27;d max spec for such HDDs (3.0ms seek + 2ms latency, so 50K random IO should need around 31 seconds with 8 disks. I&#x27;m guessing a bit of clustering in the packet distribution improves seek time so a sector/page contains multiple hits?<p>I&#x27;m interested because I wrote an app-specific indexer, but with requiring &quot;interactive&quot; query response times over a couple TB, for multiple users. But that was years ago, before LevelDB and Snappy, and Kyoto Cabinet had far too much overhead per kv), and on small CPUs and a single 7200rpm disk. I got compressions rates of 5 to 6 using QuickLZ; a non-trivial gain.<p>I was looking at this problem space again and considering a delta+int compression approach to offsets, given they&#x27;re just incremental. (And there are cool SIMD algorithms for &#x27;em.) But it sounds like SSTable + fscache is fast enough, wow, that&#x27;s pretty cool!<p>The decompression of blocks in some apps doesn&#x27;t have to be much of a penalty if there&#x27;s a reasonable amount of clustering going on in the sample set. What I did was instead of just splitting blocks on time, I segmented them based on flow and time. I did L7 inspection, and an old quad-core Core2 could handle 1Gbps, so 10Gbps is probably achievable nowadays, certainly for L4 flows. That way there&#x27;s great locality for most queries.<p>Further, the real cost is the seek, and transferring a few more sectors won&#x27;t cost as much. If you&#x27;re using mmap&#x27;d IO for reading, you might be able to compress pages and not pay any IO penalty, right? And in fact, it might even reduce the number of seeks, due to increasing clustering of packets onto the same page. And I think some of the fastest compression algorithms only look back a very small amount, like 16K or 64K anyways? Although, this is probably easier done just by using a compressed filesystem cause the cache management code is probably nontrivial.",1424722711

9096632,comment,9094487,9095405,0,0,j2kun,,,"> Not even most of the people who studied Computer Science know the difference between a function and the graph of a function.<p>I am surprised by how often I hear this example. Not because people can&#x27;t define the graph of a function, but because in usual set theoretic terms[1] a function and its graph are the same thing. They are both the set of points (x, f(x)) where x ranges over the domain of f. This is an equivalence that isn&#x27;t even made by most mathematicians, as they usually denote the graph a function as Œì(f), implying it is different from f itself as a function. Of course they know the equivalence, but prefer to separate the objects notationally for clarity&#x27;s sake.<p>[1]: I&#x27;m ignoring the notion of a function in category theory, since CS students who are taught math are primarily taught naive set theory, not category theory. Of course, when you aren&#x27;t working in a category of sets then the graph of a function doesn&#x27;t make sense, I think.",1424721865

9096629,comment,9092653,9095125,0,0,jameshart,,,"The problem with that analogy is one of choice. Your bank doesn&#x27;t select what computer you use to interact with them, you do. You bought a Lenovo machine, and it was cheaper because it came with Superfish. Just like magazines are cheaper because they contain ads. It may not be a pleasant business model, but it isn&#x27;t fundamentally wrong. You can, after all, pay a premium to get a crapware-free laptop from the Microsoft store. we can argue informed choice and more, but fundamentally there&#x27;s no reason people shouldn&#x27;t be able to buy laptops which monitor usage and provide contextual ads.<p>Instead of a bank-chosen courier, it&#x27;s a little more like: you&#x27;ve chosen to have your interactions with your bank mediated through a valet service. They open your bank mail, help file it for you, and so on. You bought the service specifically so that it would help you ease your interactions with your bank, and obviously you trust the valet service to be professional and respect your privacy.<p>Now, imagine that valet service offers a discount if you allow them to, based on the content of your bank statements, occasionally share product recommendations for which they are compensated. You might be nervous about the arrangement, and you might choose not to buy it, but if the discount is good and the service still trustworthy, you might still consider it. It probably shouldn&#x27;t be illegal for them to offer that service, certainly.<p>That&#x27;s what Lenovo thought they were doing. Leveraging the trust in them which their customers place by buying a computer from them to transact their personal business, Lenovo partnered with an organization that allowed them to offer their computers more cheaply, in exchange for, in theory, relevant product recommendations.<p>It may be a bit sleazy, but it&#x27;s not fundamentally <i>wrong</i>.<p>Now, what they screwed up on was how the organization they partnered with worked. Not with what they were supposed to do, but with they way in which they did it. They were sloppy, and they opened Lenovo&#x27;s customers to enormous risks. That&#x27;s on Lenovo.<p>It&#x27;s as if the valet service employed a mail handler without adequately supervising how they did their work, and the mail handler, through sheer incompetence, was easily able to, while looking at your mail from your bank to see if it matched up with any paid recommendations, be confused into believing that letters from people other than your bank were from your bank - and then pass those on to you.<p>Note that neither the Lenovo valet service or the incompetent mail handler are actually maliciously trying to harm you - they&#x27;ve just claimed to provide a trustworthy service which they have manifestly demonstrated they are unable to actually provide. But that doesn&#x27;t mean they couldn&#x27;t have provided the service securely if they had been more competent.",1424721852

7164762,comment,7161471,7161471,1,0,mootpointer,,,"To me it seems that all this talk of &quot;Google took away my data&quot; is rather silly. From what I can tell, Google Analytics previously would get keyword data from referrer data, which is not passed on when using https. Thus the lack of keyword data is attributable to Google improving their search experience.<p>I have heard arguments suggesting that Google does indeed have the search referral data, but it is not as easily attributable as when you could rely on http referrers, since it requires matching clicks on a SERP (which powers the webmaster tools data which you get) with people landing on your site. Not impossible, but not trivial either.<p>It would be really nice to know which search terms people are converting on (for reasons othan SEO). Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t have that luxury at the moment.",1391313561

7164756,comment,7154301,7155061,1,0,ilaksh,,,"I think that at this point EC2 should almost be described as a scam, except for cases where people are going to rely on several of the AWS services like DynamoDB that has little to no competition, and are also relying on having very low latency connections to those other AWS services from their EC2 services.  I think scam applies just because the cost differential is so much and only exists because people don&#x27;t know about other services.<p>But it is weird that people don&#x27;t know about Linode or Digital Ocean (which is incredibly cheap compared to AWS and actually works, which the micro EC2 instances often stop working if you put a load on them).  Even Rackspace would be much better option.<p>So even if you are just thinking of very popular companies, there are well known reliable options out there that are vastly better values for most things than EC2.

Try it sometime.<p>Patents are not handed out like candy, but that&#x27;s mostly because most patent submissions are still done by people who honestly think there&#x27;s still some merit to the patent system. Those who try to game it are, in fact, handed patents like candy:<p>A patent examiner has ~8 hours to examine a patent over its life, and rarely looks at prior art that was not listed in the patent. Said patent examiner is rarely an expert in the field of the patent.<p>With this situation, a patent examiner can mostly check the coherence of the application, not its novelty or obviousness - so as long as you (or your patent editor) can write a coherent, term-obfuscated, long enough document, and are willing to persist through resubmission after the first rejection, you&#x27;ll get your patent.<p>And the patent people (editor, legal, tech) like it that way.",1391313130

7164686,comment,7161926,7163605,7,0,ANTSANTS,,,"I grew up in the &quot;zero tolerance for fighting&quot; era. Even if your parents said it was ok to smack someone if they hit you first, it was drilled into kids by teachers and the administration that there would be serious consequences for both parties.<p>All it does is give more power to bullies. They can be jerks out of sight as much as they want, knowing their targets will never do anything to protect themselves. When it happened to me, I was always more overcome with fear that they would kick me out of school and my life would be over than I was scared of the bully, so I never retaliated. Of course, you can&#x27;t tell the teacher or your parents either. Not only does that make you look like a &quot;wimp,&quot; but it&#x27;s somehow against the code of kids to get an adult involved; <i>you</i> would feel ashamed if you tattled. So instead, you just put up with it, and the school basically enables the bully to torment as much as they want, as long as they aren&#x27;t dumb enough to get caught. I didn&#x27;t have too many problems with bullying growing up, but there were other kids that were basically doomed to years of torment because of this, and were seriously screwed up and jaded because of it. Even worse, even most of the regular kids would avoid the bullied kid and talk about them behind their back, partially for fear of retribution from the bully, and partially because kids in general are cruel and enjoy having power over others almost as much as the bullies themselves, so being the target of a bully meant &quot;you endure cruelty and physical violence on a daily basis, you have no friends, you cannot escape, you aren&#x27;t allowed to defend yourself, and the adults aren&#x27;t on your side.&quot;<p>Jumping forward a few years to being a teenager, a guy I didn&#x27;t like was being a jerk outside of school, and something inside of me was just so tired of always backing down that I ended up hitting him. We traded blows for a minute or so (we were more thrashing like idiots than doing anything &quot;cool&quot; and actually dangerous you&#x27;d see in a movie) before it got broken up. We were barely hurt, no busted lips or black eyes, and neither of our parents ever found out. Afterwards, I immediately had a lot more respect amongst my friends, <i>and</i> I somehow ended up becoming friends with the guy I fought. Guys are funny like that.<p>Random violence and actually hurting people is obviously not ok, but fighting back against bullies prevents them from getting overconfident and lets the bullied keep their dignity. I&#x27;m convinced that a more understanding administrative policy and less adult supervision would have allowed most of these problems to sort themselves out pretty quickly, evening out the power distribution in the classroom and making life significantly better for the worst victims of bullying. It probably wouldn&#x27;t completely solve the problem, for example in the obvious scenario where a group of older kids screw with younger kids outside of school, but at least it solves the horrendous problem we have today where, as I described above, almost an entire class is pitted against a kid.<p>> do we really want the next generation to grow up thinking that fighting is OK? Will they apply that same pattern when they&#x27;re adults?<p>As I understand it, the past few generations are the weird ones, and kids have pretty much always been allowed to get away with harmless fights. Ask your parents how often many fistfights they&#x27;ve had since graduating high school.",1391311821

7164679,comment,7161901,7161901,2,0,mattmaroon,,,"This is a silly argument.<p>1. Game developers aren&#x27;t shooting themselves in the foot. They&#x27;re catering to customers. IAP works because customers want to get a game for free, and the people who really love a game are willing to spend thousands (sometimes even tens or hundreds thereof) on it.<p>2. The old-school game model was struggling anyway. Console game sales haven&#x27;t been doing well for a long time.<p>3. You can&#x27;t rent an app, and you mostly don&#x27;t play it on someone else&#x27;s device. Both of these were ways of testing out a new franchise on consoles that no longer exist. It makes sense that something filled the void.<p>4. The platforms now (mobile devices) have a vested interest in you playing as many games as possible, moreso than you paying for them. Apple/Samsung etc. make their money by your buying a new $650+ phone every two years, and if you get a bunch of apps you love on one, you&#x27;re more likely to get another from the same OEM later. Why try to sell you a few $10 games off of which they make $3 (minus carrier fees) when they can give you a ton of free games and hope you love a few enough of them to plunk down another $650 a year from now? Until content is no longer gated by app stores that have incentives very different from those of game devs, this business model is a natural fit.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t love it either, and I make the damn things for a living. I don&#x27;t think all IAP-monetized games suck. But I do think that plenty of them do, and the misaligned incentives make it hard to make a game that is both profitable and genuinely fun that way.<p>I just don&#x27;t think the fault lies with game developers.",1391311717

7164627,comment,7159398,7162910,1,0,throwawaykf03,,,"I&#x27;m not sure which categories you mean I&#x27;m splitting mathematics into. As for precedent, even the Supreme Court cannot define abstractness other than &quot;we know it when we see it.&quot; Jurists may certainly have a loose grasp of mathematics, but it makes no difference at a general level because saying &quot;software is mathematics&quot; makes no sense when faced with the fact that executing software achieves tangible, practical results, and above all law is about practicalities. You won&#x27;t convince any judge, jury or any practical person that the software they use is abstract, because they derive practical benefit from it on a daily basis.<p>A moonshot is certainly patent-eligible. You said it yourself: it is an <i>application</i> of pure math, and it achieves tangible results, namely, transporting an object through space. The pure mathematical equations are not patented. You can use those equations for other uses, say calculating asteroid trajectories.<p>As you said, equations on predicting motion are not patentable by themselves because they don&#x27;t <i>do</i> anything by themselves. They simply describe aspects of the physical world. Any patent hoping to claim anything as such is supposed to be, and usually is, rejected out of hand.<p>But, a computer running those equations for a practical purpose, such as say, predicting impact with a car on the road and warning you, <i>is</i> patent eligible. Or maybe a method of calculating those equations more efficiently or faster using e.g. a GPU.<p>Do you see the difference? Neither of those examples is a patent on the equation itself, but rather an application thereof or a particular way of implementing it. None of those preempt you from using the equation somewhere else, e.g. to control a robot that can catch a ball you throw at it.<p>That leads to why most software patents include language for hardware. The reasons are manifold:<p>1. To be properly enabled, they must describe the invention in as much detail as possible. Ironically, after adding all that boilerplate about the hardware, they then skimp on the description of the invention itself.<p>2. The software is useless without the hardware. No machine will infringe without executing that software on hardware.<p>3. The term software itself is not well defined in the context of patent law. The constitution certainly seems to allow it, because it is undeniably a &quot;science and useful art&quot;. But when the laws were drafted there was no such thing, and so there is no statute allowing it or denying it. So it is claimed as both a method or process (a way of doing things) or a system (a machine that does things) or both. And really, software is both: when executed it does things, and the machine that executes it is a machine that does those things.",1391310504

Not one that the interviewee &quot;[got] to have&quot; as if it were placed under his christmas tree with a red bow on top.<p>How does the interviewer know that the interviewee REALLY struggled with the issue? By having the interviewee go into great detail. The author of the article suggested discussing the accomplishment for 15-20 minutes, and he outlined over twenty questions that the interviewer should ask with respect to the accomplishment.<p>There&#x27;s a short clip where Elon Musk outlines a similar approach to interviewing applicants:<p>&quot;...I ask them to tell me about the problems they worked on and how they solved them. If someone was really the person that solved it, they&#x27;ll be able to answer multiple levels, they&#x27;ll be able to go down to the brass-tax. And if they weren&#x27;t, they&#x27;ll get stuck and you can say &#x27;Oh this person was not really the person who solved it&#x27;. Because anyone who really struggled hard with a problem never forgets it.&quot;[1]<p>So, in this sense, I don&#x27;t believe that the quality of the interviewee&#x27;s answer hinges on &quot;socio economic status&quot;. In fact -in my opinion- the less you have handed to you, the BETTER equipped you are to answer this question in a satisfactory manor.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-job-interview-rule-2013-12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-job-interview-rule-...</a>",1391310449

Yes. How do you read out values given a key?

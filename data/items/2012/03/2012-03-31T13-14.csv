Even though there are some changes of word order and grammatical forms in Romance languages that don't directly correspond to English, the differences between English and Japanese seem likely to be irreconcilable into any kind of pidgin dialect. On the other hand, there are far more cognates between English and Japanese.",1333202347

3780305,comment,3776766,3776939,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"I think one of the reasons is that OS X provides automatic double-buffering of window content at the OS level (it also has a somewhat different drawing model than Windows), which adds a bit of latency but reduces flicker. Another factor is that Mac apps typically adapt themselves to the size of a window, and resizing will trigger a redraw of <i>everything</i>. Apps like Mail have always been really slow at redrawing themselves, whereas Chrome is very fast.<p>OS X was written from the ground up to be graphics-intensive.  From very early on, Quartz, OS X's compositing manager, has been using the GPU to render windows to OpenGL textures, essentially using the graphics card's very fast 3D support to render a 2D screen.<p>Windows's classic GDI (which has been replaced by Aero, afaik, but I guess most apps are still GDI) is considerably simpler, and leaves the drawing entirely to the application. This is the reason you see a lot more redraw flickering in Windows apps. Some apps are so slow at redrawing that when you resize the window to make it bigger, you can see the new unpainted areas filled with various garbage (or with some default background colour at best) before the actual content comes in. To create smooth, non-flickering widget drawing in Windows you have always been forced to do the double-buffering yourself.<p>Even in Windows 7 there is a lot of redraw flickering. I'm particularly annoyed about how the mouse cursor tend to flicker randomly -- eg. when Internet Explorer is loading a page -- which is such a small, trivial detail, but one that ends up making the entire OS <i>feel</i> shoddily built.",1333202152

Mostly the reason is either convenience or lack of cash to buy in the first place.<p>I think of all the CD's I bought in the past which turned out to be garbage apart from the two singles released which are the reason for buying the CD. I think of all the DVD's I bought that I watched once. Now I don't have to waste my money. I can down load for free and buy a decent packaged copy if I deem it worthy of my money.<p>Thing is, I've been stitched up for years by these gits with terrible product, and I was getting back my wasted money. Now I purchase wisely because I can try it out first. I only buy what I personally feel is good product. I delete the garbage.<p>I suppose the media companies will require lots of their customers to be sued and jailed before any one in politics stands up to them and says, "" no, you are wrong. You sales are down because your product is mostly rubbish, and sold in an inconvenient way. People are valuing your product as zero. Where they don't, they buy. ""<p>What the media companies are concerned about is that they are losing the ability to con us with rubbish. What I think is good, is that the sales they now do have are probably better quality sales, and the people who did buy are happier with what they bought.<p>Said it before, but all that is happening here is that governments are for some reason trying to prop up failing business models. I dont understand why. If it were that the pace of technology threatened a clockwork clock company, then that company would be expected to either move on or go out of business. Some how, no so with the media companies. I assume that its to do with money, political funding and the usual democratic corruption.<p>Pah, could be wrong, but that's my current thinking.",1333202112

Whatever project somebody else successfully starts, Google can simply outspend them and reach the goal first, but this isnt specific to Google, you have this problem with any other big solvent company.

(Actually, that site is pretty interesting to visit if you're on a friend's WiFi or at an airport or internet cafe -- I just found out that, from this WiFi point, someone downloaded The Lion King in December 2011.)<p>But yeah. Pretty much any tracker is constantly disclosing peers; that's how BitTorrent works. It is considered important for a tracker to introduce fake IP addresses into these lists, so that simply being on the list is not enough to prove that someone was actually downloading a given bit of content, and there have now been research groups which have gotten takedown notices delivered to printers and so forth, so that if you're not confirmed to be seeding content it's hard to confirm that you're breaking the law.<p>It is also considered best practice with BitTorrent to use an IP blocklist with your client, but those are probably not too hard for a dedicated attacker to get around -- if you share illegal material and use an IP blocklist, you are basically saying ""I will hope that you pick the low-lying fruit first, before you pick me.""",1333200040

(I should add that my wife was with me, and that she was fairly pregnant.)<p>Sat down to do the deal and as he was beginning to prepare the paperwork I offered the sales man 10,000. I told him I only had 10k available and that I had to buy a car today, and would 10k be acceptable?<p>Sales man went off to ""ask his manager"". He came back and offered 11,500.<p>I got up, smiled nicely and said, ""OK, no problem, I realise I'm offering too little but its all I have. A pity, but I'll have look else where as I only have 10k, time is short and I will need to look elsewhere as I need a car today. Thanks for your time"". (Im sure I actually said that more concisely than I just typed it!!) I was polite, respectful of his position but was equally quite prepared to walk.<p>He jumped up and said he would ask his manager again. I sat back down and he came back offering 11,250. I repeated the same lines (ish) as before. In other words, I only have 10k and I had to seal a deal today... Off he went again. This loop went on until he eventually offered 10,500. By this time, I was kind of agitated because time was running out, and I didn't want to waste time on a deal that might not happen. I was honestly keen to move on and try else where. At that point I looked in my wallet and pulled out a 20 note, and offered 10,020. He looked beat and accepted the 10k. He probably look as beat as I looked surprised.<p>So, I had to go off and pick up 1000 for a deposit, and because my wife was pregnant, she decided to stay in the comfy chair in the show room. Shortly later, I came back with the deposit, and completed the deal.<p>Once we left, my wife told me what the sales man said while I was away. The sales man turned to my wife and said, ""Wow, I have never deal with such a hard negotiator in my career. I've never given any one 2k off a sale, let alone on a 12k car."" To which my wife replied, ""He wasn't negotiating, everything he said was completely true. We do only have 10k, and we do have to by a car today. He was not negotiating, that was the genuine position"". Apparently, he look relieved to know that.<p>What I learned:<p>I didn't really car want car I bought. Any car in its class was good enough. I was not in ""love"" with a particular car.<p>I had a fixed budged that could not be increased. I do not do credit in any way, ever.<p>One key bit I thought about much later on was that the car I wanted to buy was not the same make as the dealer's franchise. It was a Peugeot dealer selling a part exchanged Ford. However, the asking price was perfectly fair . As it stood, 12k was a reasonable asking price.<p>The truth is, I was quite prepared to walk, in fact, I was on a hair trigger to walk because I had only half a day left to do a deal.<p>You chaps might well have other things to add.<p>Anyway, my advice would be : Don't be in love with a particular car, have a fixed budged, make the dealer know you are ready to buy, but equally be prepared to walk. Lastly, try to find a car in a dealer which in not the same make as that car you want. Find a VW in a Ford dealer, for example.<p>This was not a method, is was necessity. But now is is my method, and has worked for me several times since, and not just with car buying. I have also helped friends buy cars and done similar deals for them.<p>One last thing, sorry, I was after a second hand car, not a new one. Obviously a key difference. Even so, my experience still might help others out buying.<p>Sorry for the long post!!!!<p>Edit: Jeez, that was long....",1333199074

In other words, the giant deficit is mainly the result of the collapse in tax receipts brought on by the recession, not the increase in spending. Nice to know, huh?""\n--Justin Fox<p>This one seems a little misleading.  Fox is comparing 2010 spending vs. revenue to the 2000-2007 trend, but spending far outpaced revenue in this period.  When revenue dropped in the recession, he points to that and says, ""see, it's a revenue problem.""  But even if revenues somehow hadn't dropped dramatically during the recession and the trend continued, the federal government would still be spending much more than it is taking in.  That seems to me more indicative of a spending problem.",1303055358

2456309,comment,2455105,2456201,1,0,jtheory,,,"It sounds like you're referring to two different large Java projects, though.  If you can port it by just stripping out the boilerplate -- if it's at heart just a CRUD UI with 7 frameworks and ""enterprise best practices"" mixed in -- then this is not the twisted and unmaintainable monster you're talking about afterwards.  It's less fun, but I've worked on lots of sprawling & unwieldy Java apps implementing simple requirements, and it's not hard (it's also not easy to justify a rewrite, unfortunately).  Bugfixes don't take weeks (or even days), particularly not once you know your way around a bit.<p>The app with the twisted logic (where bugs take weeks to fix, that has mutated over years and years of hacked-in change requests and quirky tweaks often for specific users' needs) is the one that screams for rewriting, but this is also the app where no-one knows exactly what it does anymore.<p>And if you don't know what it does, I have no idea how you could claim to know what it should do.<p>Many of the odd features are there for customers who aren't even customers anymore, but no one knows.  Even the code doesn't always help much -- I've seen processing where it fails in the mid-method every time for some foolish reason (and logs an error then returns), but the code <i>after</i> the failure is actually direly broken and must never be executed.<p>I've tried (failed, actually) rewriting one of these as well as doing lots of refactoring on these kinds of projects.<p>With the first kind of app, you still understand it, so bugs can be fixed, new features are possible, and there's no clear case to rewrite it.  With the second kind of app, you can either do what I mentioned above (and maybe you're talking about this, more than a rewrite?) -- start talking with/watching users, take a lot of notes, and build a new similar application all the way through, which will necessarily start off missing much of the functionality of the existing one.<p>Refactoring isn't about giving you time; it's about paying off technical debt and forcing the codebase back into a state where you can do progressively larger refactorings.  This includes modularizing the existing app so that you can replace it piecemeal.  New pieces do not need to operate within the old framework.  It's quite possible (and sometimes desirable) to refactor the original codebase completely out of existence.",1303054651

In exchange, you get extreme granularity over how the server stores and retrieves data. Once you do that, you frequently get at least an order of magnitude speedup in your data, maybe 2 orders, depending on the data and access patterns.<p>I do not anticipate significant numbers of people dumping their redis or membase stores for this solution, because the press release strongly implies a 1.2-1.5x speedup for certain data access, not 10x-100x. 1.5x isn't good enough; if it were, people would have tuned MySQL some other way originally rather than moving architecture over to KV stores like they did.<p>This will likely get uptake from people who are already committed to MySQL and occasionally want to use a KV store for certain data patterns. I would anticipate, though, that this will just make it easier for those folks to move their KV store out of MySQL once it scales.<p>And that's not such a bad thing to offer to people, so I take back my earlier disappointment.",1303053778

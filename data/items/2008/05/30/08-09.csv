Consequently, it would help people like me considering whether to take you up on your offer if you would say where you live.<p>Particularly, I live in the northern part of San Francisco Bay area and almost never travel out of the Bay area, so I would be interested if you lived somewhere in the Bay area (north or south) or were planning a trip out here soon.<p>ith@sonic.net",1212137256

They generally don't do jack, even when you hand them the entire case.<p>The FBI will do absolutely nothing in this case with Revision3 and it's not because the perpetrator has a minuscule semblance of legitimacy.

I know when Google offered me a job in Mt.View, one of the factors which led me to not accept was that between Vancouver and what I had seen of the bay area, I much preferred Vancouver -- but I grew up in Vancouver, and my tastes have probably been molded by that.  If you grew up in a dry, polluted, urban sprawl, you might prefer the bay area.<p><i>I imagine I would just be paying more in taxes...</i><p>Don't be so certain.  Canada has publicly-funded health care, which tends to raise taxes, but it also has much lower per-capita military spending than the US.  I can't make much sense out of US income tax forms, but Google found me <a href=""http://dbaron.org/views/taxes-2007.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dbaron.org/views/taxes-2007.html</a>; comparing it to an analysis I did last year <a href=""http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2007-05.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2007-05.html</a> it looks like a single California taxpayer typically pays a marginal tax rate of about 40% of income while a single BC taxpayer typically pays a marginal rate of about 26% of income -- of course, in BC we have provincial and federal sales taxes which add a combined 12% to most things you'll be buying (does California have any sales tax?  I don't know), and gasoline taxes which are higher than you have in the US.  In short: I suspect that the difference between taxes you pay in the bay area and taxes you'd pay in Vancouver could be either positive or negative depending on your individual situation.<p>Then of course there's the issue of real estate costs: Vancouver is the most expensive place in Canada, but I understand that it's still far cheaper than the bay area...",1212136459
204158,comment,204038,204038,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Last I checked, Costa Rica had pretty liberal immigration for high tech entrepreneurs.  If you are willing to invest a certain ammount, ($30K last I checked) you can get residency.  And, they do have a decent high tech sector with a number of online gambling websites being hosted there.  Intel also has a fab there.<p>Weather is phenomenal, it's about 75 degrees F year around in the capital city, San Jose.  And, because it's an isthmus, the Pacific is 2 hours away from San Jose and the Caribbean is 3 hours away.<p>I lived there in the 80's and it was great.  My brother just moved away (had to move away because of work) and said that traffic was getting a bit burdensome, though.<p>If you go, drop me a line and I'll tell you some great places to go snorkeling.",1212136434

It is going to take a couple of years for CIO's to realize what a nightmare shared state concurrency is to engineer.

As any good musician will tell you, music is about what you do with the space <i>in between</i> the notes;  graphic design is about what you do with the space <i>around</i> the content (and if your content is good, the less crap you need to put around it!)<p>If you use a simple layout, a very small palette of 4-8 colors, 1 font, and only a few font sizes, you'll find that your designs will improve automatically.  If you lack even the basic ability to coordinate colors, use a tool (<a href=""http://www.colorschemer.com/schemes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.colorschemer.com/schemes/</a> is a good source), and never deviate from the scheme that you choose.<p>Remember:  think Google, not Microsoft.",1212134483

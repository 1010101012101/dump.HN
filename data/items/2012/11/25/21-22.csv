4829431,comment,4828497,4828497,1,0,Petrushka,,,"KISS. Too much writing in the non-fiction world, whether it be academic, scientific, or related to business, is far too complex for its own good. This is seemingly to overwhelm, to simultaneously weed out and impress those who are not deeply versed in the subject, but in almost no cases is that a positive development. For academia and science, the point of your work should be to encourage knowledge and learning, which complex language in no way helps. In business, the last thing you want to do is assume a level of expertise from a customer, except in very specific and rare circumstances.<p>I am aware that there are certain fields and types of works that have to use difficult phrasing and structure for the purpose of limiting ambiguity, but often such writing is found in cases where such strictness is not necessary. So, Keep It Simple, Stupid.<p>P.S. - Not trying to be rude, but your initial post is a great example of writing at a more complex level that is in anyway necessary. Micro- and macrostructure, the usage of an undefined and unnecessary acronym in USP? It doesn't matter whether it is a safe assumption that your audience knows what you are talking about, as you never know when that audience may shift without your knowledge.",1353880746

It occurred to me the other day, after dealing with a stupid hover.com problem, that it has become almost impossible for network admins at different networks to talk to each-other.<p>I have never, not once, in the five or six years I've been doing network admin work, been able to contact another network admin to report a problem. Instead, I have to go through incompetent and clueless frontline support first, and spend hours or days navigating that until the problem is no longer relevant anymore or I give up.<p>It became obvious that I wasn't the only one that had given up on contacting network admins when I recently had to deal with a spam issue (same spammer, multiple hosting providers, new technique) -- while I tried following the RBL rules, it was clear that other service providers entirely skipped the ""notify the network admin, give them reasonable time to resolve the problem before nominating their block for the RBL"" step. the victim networks all became listed on the RBLs within just a few hours of the first waves of spam.<p>It's just gotten to be too much trouble, nobody bothers anymore, and unfortunately that will have to include me from now on too. If I see bad behavior coming from another network, I won't any longer even try to contact anybody at the other network; I'll just ban their IP and move on.<p>What a tremendously stupid situation.",1353880737

But if I could tell you just one thing, it's that reading books is in no way comparable to going to a decent college. You'll be exposed, directly and indirectly, to so many different things at university. Things that would never have occurred to you otherwise.<p>You'll have to do projects that seem irrelevant, but being forced to learn X skill will pay off later in life. That's the main issue with being self-taught: you tend to only do things you're interested in, and as a result, you miss out on some of the more boring, important stuff.<p>Final thought: students have a ton of free time.

4829398,comment,4828965,4828965,3,0,Hupo,,,"Speaking of archaisms, especially in case of video/film content, there's also one other thing... exclusive licensing.<p>Seriously, exclusive licensing has absolutely no place whatsoever in the digital market. Yet they're still generally bundled with physical licenses like DVD rights and whatnot and then you end up with digital stores region locked to a single country because they haven't ""licensed"" it to stores operating in other countries or they have licensed it to some entity in said country that doesn't give the slightest toss about serving people in a nice digital manner.<p>Think about it: if exclusive licensing didn't exist for digital distribution, all TV shows and whatnot would be given out to any interested party. It could actually be feasible to have some real competition on what entity gives you the best service instead of what entity has the most content licensed. Sure, we have that now too, but I'm fairly certain that this would accelerate it quite dramatically.<p>And the biggest reason why digital exclusivity is completely dumb is because <i>it isn't actually exclusive.</i> If your content is popular, it's bound to get pirated, and they sure don't care who or what might happen to have an exclusive license for legitimately streaming or selling that particular show in whatever particular country an user might be downloading from.

If proving theorems could be readily automated, this would have been done already. Indeed, automation has succeeded for some kinds of problems (e.g. google Wilf and Zeilberger's ""WZ method"" in combinatorics for a particularly successful example)<p>>Doesn't that mean that verifying proofs is then based on a super handwavy process where a bunch of researchers come to a consensus and say ""yes, this is correct""?<p>Basically, yes.<p>>What if they all overlook some crucial aspect because of the way they were trained, or their entrenched / ingrained assumptions?<p>This happens surprisingly rarely. It helps that we are trained to constantly question our entrenched assumptions.<p>>Could we maybe have a common database of well-known proofs, axioms, concepts etc, so that you wouldn't have to rewrite common ideas from scratch?<p>Various books fill this purpose. But the problem is that theorems are difficult to encapsulate. For example, a theorem will say ""Assume X, Y, and Z. Then A and B are true."" and you need to use it in some situation where Z isn't true, but some appropriate variant of Z is, and any expert would know how to conclude that A and B are true.

4829395,comment,4828273,4829316,7,0,Osiris,,,"The problem is this common analogy is completely off base.  When you steal from a store, that store had purchased a physical product from a wholesaler. This is know as the ""cost of goods sold.""  The store maintains an inventory of product for which they have already paid a significant sum of money in order to place it on the shelves.<p>When you steal from the store you remove an item from their inventory which they cannot sell. The cost of that item that was already paid now has to be covered by profits made up from selling other items in the inventory, thus increasing (albeit very little) the price of the rest of the inventory.<p>In other words, the physical good is moved from one place to another, depriving the original owner of its value.<p>File sharing, on the other hand, has no marginal cost to each ""copy"" of a file.  If I write a song or software and put it on the internet, it costs me nothing if 1 or one million people share the file (assuming it's not my bandwidth to pay for).  Also, if one user downloads my file it does not disappear or transfer from me to them. I do not have to manufacture another item.  File sharing is copying. Stealing is transfer of ownership.<p>So, you cannot directly compare file sharing, which has no marginal cost, to physical items that have a marginal cost of production.

4829368,comment,4829071,4829215,15,0,mdasen,,,"I think there are a few reasons for this.<p>First, there is the question of where Android's growth is.  Apple is clearly going for the $200 price point on-contract.  Yes, they sell their old models, but Android has a more diverse ecosystem.  If we limited ourselves to equivalents (the top of the line iPhone and the several top of the line Android devices (Nexus 4, One X, GS III, etc.)) would there be so many more Android shipments?  So, Android's shipments might be coming more on the low-end: the end that people like us don't purchase from as much.<p>Second, in the Mac vs. Windows era, there was a significant price disparity.  If you're in the market for a top-of-the-line smartphone on-contract today, you're likely paying $200 for an Android phone or iPhone.  Windows computers always had a significant price discount over equivalent Macs.<p>Third, in the Mac vs. Windows era, Macs often were under-spec'd.  While Apple tried to make the best of the 603-G5 processors, Intel was just on a roll.  You'd pay more and end up with less muscle.  Today, the iPhone's A6 matches the quad-cores that Americans haven't been getting since LTE took precedence over quad-core in the GS III generation.<p>Fourth, in the Mac vs. PC era, Macs were technologically inferior for many years.  I'm specifically talking about the Classic Mac OS.  Mac OS 8/9 was beautiful.  Windows looked like it was designed in crayon by comparison (to me).  However, its cooperative multitasking was just sad.  Windows 95 really showed that OSs could be better (even if I thought that its UI was sub-par).  When OS X and Windows XP came out, OS X was dog-slow - slow to the point of unusable.  Apple really improved it and made it into the OS that many of us (myself included) love today.  However, I remember 2001 and how envious I was of Windows users.<p>Fifth, in the Mac vs. PC era, Macs were app-poor.  There was just a lot of compelling stuff that you couldn't run as a Mac user.  The move toward the web changed a lot of that and left Apple with a great way back into the market.  With the iPhone, I find that the iPhone does a better job on web pages than Android (note, I haven't used Android 4.1 and 4.2).  Stats on web usage on mobile phones seem to bear this out as iPhone web browsing tends to dominate Android web browsing.  Likewise, the iPhone at least matches Android on apps, but I think it could be argued to be the primary platform for apps.  So, there isn't a penalty to using an iPhone in the way that there was a penalty to using a Mac in the Mac vs. PC era.<p>Basically, the iPhone isn't more expensive at the top-of-the-line, the iPhone has specs that no one would deny are top of the line, iOS isn't an inferior OS (personal preference about certain features aside), and there isn't a penalty to using iOS (if anything, it could be considered the first platform).  None of this is meant to say that the iPhone is better than an Android phone.  I don't care what you enjoy using.  It's meant to demonstrate that iOS doesn't have the same cost premium, that if we limit ourselves to the devices that people like us buy the marketshare disparity might not be there, that even if iOS is a minority platform it still gets as good attention or better from developers, the specs are equivalent which they weren't in computers for a long time, and iOS and Android are both great modern OSs.  If you were an early adopter, iOS came a couple years before Android.<p>In the Mac vs. PC era, Windows was more popular not just because popularity breeds popularity.  It was hugely cheaper, better spec'd, and a superior OS for a good while.  If you loved computing, Apple's tidyness might have been well out-shadowed by Windows 95's multi-tasking, app availability, price, specs, etc.  If you like iOS, why choose an Android device as your next phone?  No reason really. Similarly, there aren't compelling reasons if you like Android to buy an iPhone - Android phones today have high-res displays, are starting to get serious on build quality, similar specs, etc.  It wasn't hard to convince a Mac user in 2000 to switch to Windows: you got a better OS, more apps, a faster computer, for half the price.  I could convince people to switch to Windows with good, logical arguments that really rang true.  Today, how would you convince an iPhone user to switch to Android?  I'm not saying Android is bad, just that it's a lot harder to make that argument.",1353879251

Its safe to assume they've decided they'll make the most money this way. So why? That is a much more interesting question.<p>Some things to think about:<p>1) iTunes/Amazon/Google pay the content producer each time they sell something (basically consignment), instead of making a big purchase upfront and then reselling the product (like DVDs, or even Netflix). The DVD model seems much better for the content producer, as the DVD saler is taking some of the risk whereas iTunes/Amazon/etc assume none of the risk.<p>2) Cannibalization is a bigger issue than we might think.

Thus the growth of piracy may be limited in a way the OP does not understand (not by viruses or technological hurdles, but just because some people don't want to be pirates).<p>Perhaps there's a model where simultaneous releases do make more sense for the sellers. I'd certainly welcome it.

It's the craft I've dedicated my life to, and I'm grateful to see a group of really smart people investing time in the skill. It validates the effort I've poured into becoming the writer I am today. Particularly since I've chosen to be a writer in the startup community, which sometimes makes me feel singled out or awash in a sea of programmers :-)<p>To start, writing is often broken down into discrete rules like <i>Grammar</i> and <i>Syntax</i> as well as <i>Word Choice</i> and <i>Sentence Length</i>, all of which could be summed up as the overall <i>Style</i> of a particular piece of writing. I love the Nabokov quote below because he's one of the all-time greats, and although Hemingway is my favorite author of all time, the critique of leaving things out is valid. One of the supposedly set-in-stone commandments of writing, particularly for the web is to focus on brevity above all else because the audience is presumed to have the attention span of a gnat, particularly when Mark Zuckerburg's mind-melding software is constantly clamoring for your attention and mental processing power...but I digress.<p>My approach as a writer is to place all of the stylistic and grammatical elements of writing in a distant second place to a thorough understanding of your audience. Understanding who you need your app's content to connect with is the only thing that matters, and will give you all the data you need to write grammatically, and choose the right words, or use synonyms. To put another way, writing is just communication. Good writing only means communicating effectively.<p>Understanding your audience tells you which rules of grammar your audience <i>don't care about</i> and that you can therefore break.<p>Have you ver read a sentence on a website that ended a sentence with a preposition and wondered what the hell the writer was on?<p>Of course, I'm singling out poor grammar in the previous sentence as a way to make a point. I broke a rule simply as a tactic to get your attention, and then point out that if I've got your attention, then my writing style was effective. I can only get your attention if I know what you're paying attention to, because I've done the work to deeply understand what motivates you.<p>HackerNews is largely a developer audience. Developers are a detail-oriented bunch, and I take that into account whenever I post here. In the above example, by making a calculated error and hiding it in the middle of several paragraphs, I'm essentially leaving my message hidden in plain sight, because I know that most of my readers on this post have spent hours in front of their computers paying attention and even exploiting tiny details as they bend software to their will.<p>Yep, leaving a preposition at the end of the sentence is grammatically incorrect, and even grates on most people who are detail-oriented for a living. But that actually makes it effective.<p>If I were writing this the same way I wrote my honors thesis on the Pick-Up Artist Community, I wouldn't have left a single preposition hanging out there. Different audience. My style had to reflect the purpose.<p>Your style and your message are affected by the following things, in the following order:<p>1) Your audience - Perform a customer development, or what I call ""rhetorical analysis"" on your audience to get into their heads. Survey them to develop a profile of who they are and how they want to communicate with them. This is why Ramit Sethi of iwillteachyoutoberich.com is constantly surveying his lists. He finds patterns of language in the responses and uses them in product development and marketing.<p>2) Your communication medium - Use words differently in email than on Twitter. Write your blog posts differently than your white papers. Consider the constraints of the communication medium and learn to exploit them. For example, Twitter's 140 characters means certain grammar rules are expected to be broken. But there are rules about breaking those rules as well. ""U wont git far if u luv 2 tweet lik dis.""<p>3) Your communication mode - a fancy way of analyzing the ""genre"" of your communication. Basically, what's the <i>feel</i> or the <i>sense</i> of your communication. Different modes in literature are poetry and prose. Different modes in startups are the mode used when you ask for an introduction as when you develop your business plan.<p>4) Your goals with each communication - what do you actually want to accomplish, and then how can you approach that goal in such a way that it will resonate deeply with your audience, fit into the given medium, and be in line with the context and reader expectations of the communication mode?<p>Before I sit down to write anything, I mentally (or literally on paper) do a rhetorical analysis of my audience, the medium, and my goals. Here's what I came up with for this comment on HN.<p>Audience: Hackers, entrepreneurs, startup folks, wantrapreneurs, highly intelligent, subtle, intensely focused and motivated to read long pieces IF they are learning something, LEARNING is a primary motivator, Opinionated and reality-based so high need to provide specific examples to general rhetorical principles, detail-oriented from years of writing code, or simply by birth.<p>Medium: HackerNews forums. Highly trafficked, vibrant discussions, sometimes full of intense disagreements, an appropriate forum for a larger comment, ONLY if every word is carefully chosen. Brevity would be preferred, but long-form prose will be tolerated if writer managed to be interesting and informative along the way.<p>Mode: Deductive reasoning, dry and analytical, ethos of ""sharing"" and ""contribution"" over ""self-aggrandizement"" or ""self-promotion.""  Smart, accomplished people sharing what they've learned over the years, contributing insight to the community in one giant effort to support one another's growth. Sometimes hostile to marketing or sales. Beware of trolls...<p>My goals: To share my strategy to be successful at my craft with a group of fellow startup folks who I admire and am motivated to spend time around. To add my own life experience to the mix in hopes of helping someone become a better writer. To increase my own visibility and prominence in the group over time, and develop a good reputation in the long term. To feel smart (not relevant to writing effectively, but shared in the spirit of honesty).<p>I could keep writing about this, apparently, since my ideas keep flowing, but this is a monster post already, so I want to simply thank you all if you've managed to read this far.

You could also consider neighboring Lombok / Gili islands which are growing more expensive and more trendy, or if you find you can do without any western amenities,  there any number of hidden coastal gems through the archipelago such as Manado / Bunaken.

Which is not a lot really, as from your argument it is surely also fine to persecute people dressed even slightly like americans, in those countries which america has attacked, if it is fine to persecute people wearing headscarves, for an extremist attack over a decade ago.<p>Also, if you want to round up the litany of death from dogma, athiest states have been just as destructive as religious ones over the past hundred years or so.<p>[edit] I have personally have found that generic religious/philosophic affiliation (Buddhist, Athiest, Christian, etc) seems to have very little bearing on if someone will be a dickhead, and also that all large affiliations seem to have their fair share of them.

The issue is rather the one about lowest common denominator. HTML5 aims at working in very varied ""runtime environment"", where standards are bendable, bugs are rife and feature support a few years behind what native could muster. HTML5 is more difficult, and does not have all the tools, of the native environment. So the question is rather - will HTML5 develop faster than native and thereby be on par with it, or will it always be the straggler?",1350867341

There's not nearly enough detail here to know what's going on. Some possibilities that spring to mind:<p>1. They may have taken advantage of special tax credits offered by the government for activities that it was deemed to be in the best interest of society at large.<p>2. Ebay UK may have carry-forward losses from a previous year that lowered their tax.<p>3. These ""sales"" may just be gross revenue, completely ignoring the issue of COGS, which means gross income might only be $50m or something much lower. I know the article cited Ebay's global profit margin as being 23%, but is that on gross revenue or gross income? That seems high to be on gross revenue...<p>4. This revenue may have been earned by subsidiaries owned by Ebay UK, but the money was never brought into the UK and has been reinvested into those subsidiaries. For example, Ebay UK owns Ebay Monaco, where there are no corp taxes. Ebay Monaco does $10m in profit. If they sent that money back to Ebay UK, they'd owe UK taxes on it. Instead, they reinvest it into hiring more staff and expanding the Monaco office. If and when the money goes back to the parent entity, it'll be taxed then.<p>Getting upset about corporate tax law based on newspaper articles is a fool's errand.<p>EDIT: More details:<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/10/21/ebay-is-not-avoiding-taxes-no-this-is-instead-the-point-of-the-system/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/10/21/ebay-is-n...</a><p>Looks like they're just taking advantage of EU law to have payments from consumers go to a subsidiary in a lower tax jurisdiction.

4681376,comment,4679864,4681172,13,0,lyudmil,,,"I disagree strongly with pretty much all of your points.<p>You acknowledge that the vast majority of the evidence points towards universal healthcare systems being more economically efficient in your first sentence. You then proceed to make an argument that basically asserts the US is a special case and that a universal care system wouldn't ""behave"" as it does everywhere else and reduce costs, but instead increase them. I see no basis for this assumption and I want to challenge you to demonstrate why you should be granted it.<p>I also want to challenge you on your implied definition of ""useful"" or ""efficient"". You say you would favor a universal system if you were to see convincing evidence that it would reduce costs. In your argument, I at least, read an implicit assumption that cost ought to be the deciding factor. I find that point of view detestable. For corporations, whose sole purpose is profits, it makes sense to think of efficiency that way. You and I, however, are people, and shouldn't have values that put resource acquisition higher than human well-being. You're free to disagree, but doing so would convince me that we have very little common basis for dialog.<p>In the last part of your comment you give France as an example of a country that will suffer dire economic repercussions for having run an unsustainable universal healthcare system. I haven't double-checked your references, but I'm happy to grant you, for the sake of argument, that the data is on your side. You've chosen to ignore the vast majority of strong economies with universal healthcare. You've also failed to mention that whatever problems France may have in the future, they pale in comparison to the budgetary problems the US is facing due to the privatized healthcare system it is currently running.

They have just as much code and generally rearrange it into a form that I find less readable.  For his first example, he provides the callback function (which is actually empty, but whatever) but the promise version doesn't show the function.  If it did, it'd be just as verbose and hard to read, if not moreso.<p>Now, that changes a bit with the .then syntax later.  With callbacks, you'd end up with a series of nested callbacks, which can get just as ugly as a series of nested if statements.  The .then syntax lets you chain it all together in a more visually pleasing way, and I think it's easier to read, too.<p>In short, the way promises are often done is wrong (and he's saying so) and there's a proper way to do it.

A specific example, a specific block of JSON and a specific task.  Once I have that, then I can ask myself ""Is this something I would ever need to do or that I have to do on a regular basis?""<p>Sometimes I need to write one-off filters.  There is just no getting around it.  I have to choose a utility that gives maximum flexibility and is not too verbose; I don't like to type.  Lots of people like Perl, and other similar scripting languages for writing one-off filters.  But Perl, _out of the box_, is not a line-by-line filter.  It's unlike sed/awk; it needs more memory.  That brings us to #2.<p>2. If I understand correctly, jq is reading the entire JSON block into memory.  This is what separates your program and so many other sed/awk ""replacements"" from sed and awk, the programs they purport to ""replace"".  sed/awk don't read entire files into memory, they operate line-by-line and use a reasonably small buffer.  Any sed/awk ""replacement"" would have to match that functionality.  Given that sed/awk don't read in an entire structure (JSON, XML, etc.) before processing it, they are ideal for memory constrained environments.  (As long as you don't overfill their buffers, which rarely happens in my experience.)<p>Anyway, so far I like this program.

It is literally an icon, a picture that stands for something on its own.<p>Compare with the pen and eraser icons: there is no physical paper on which to write (or erase) on a computer. In fact one of the primary goals of personal computing has been to rid us of pen and paper. This has not been reached yet, but maybe the day will come when a pen is as foreign to young people as the floppy is today...

There's nothing wrong with disapproving of such businesses.<p>>You never know how or when your product will be used, or who it will help.<p>Your argument is: because businesses can yield unanticipated utility, there is no point reasoning about which business is best to spend time on.<p>Sure, perhaps the cat-pictures business will, through some unexpected turn of events, yield greater social utility than an education startup: Our models of the world are imperfect, and sometimes we mis-predict which actions will be most beneficial.<p>But that doesn't mean we should give up reasoning about what the most beneficial thing to do is.
We should still attempt to reason about relative benefits, and act to maximise our expected future utility.<p>Which is not to say we should always ""focus on shipping all of extra food to those who are starving"".
Indeed, maybe some technology that looks trivial will yield huge benefits.  So we should definitely spend some time exploring new technologies, to try and catch unexpected windfalls.

4681317,comment,4680796,4680796,7,0,susanhi,,,"Before getting married, my husband spent several years getting rid of most of his stuff. By the time we got married, he literally had one suitcase of clothes, a car, laptop, and golf clubs. As for me, I had shelves full of books, old papers, yearbooks, photos, drums, costumes, snowboard, etc. You get the idea.<p>So, I asked my then-fiance for some help. Here's what we did.<p>Phase 1 - Sorting:
My fianc came over and took all of my possessions and dumped everything onto my living room floor. The pile looked like a big ugly hill. I never imagined that I had so much stuff because when it was all so organized back then. He also brought a bunch of file-sided boxes with handles from Staples, and brought in the large outdoor garbage can (the huge one that you put out on the curb every week).<p>We then got to work. We had boxes for things to keep, things to give away and the large trashcan for things to throw away. I sorted through everything until the floor was clear.<p>Phase 2 - Digitizing:
We then went through a digitized everything that could be digitized. Photos were sent to a photo scanning service. Yearbooks, journals, birthday cards, important books, etc were torn apart and put through a fujitsu scanner. For things that couldn't be fed through a scanner, like my drums and gifts that had sentimental value, I took a picture of it and donated it. This was a large project that took several months.<p>Phase 3 - Detaching:
There were things from phase 1 that I knew I didn't want to keep, but that I didn't want to get rid of either. So I kept those things in boxes in my closet until I was ready to get rid of it. It took probably several months to a year to get rid of some of those boxes. Keeping those items in boxes helped me to detach from them emotionally until I was ready to get rid of them. However, there were some items that even after a year and a half, I still was attached to. So my husband took them out and put them in our living room again so that I could face it. I eventually got rid of those things too, but I took a picture of those items so that I could still keep the memories of what those things represented before donating them.",1350865494

All three of my kids got a checking account when they were 5 (USAA is great for this), they were doing their own laundry by the time they were 10 and making their own lunches. By the time they reached 13 we started a program where each night one person was responsible for dinner that night for all five of us, didn't matter what it was, just had to be reasonably nutritious. Spaghetti? Pretty easy. Mac-n-Cheese, whitesauce with cheeses and some boiled noodles. Croque Madam? Ham sandwhiches with an egg. Steamed vegetables? straight forward. Etc. The goal of my wife and I was that our kids when they hit 18 needed to be able to manage a checkbook, cook their own meals economically, and manage their own laundry/hygiene. When they went off to college that was going to be expected after all.<p>The benefit to the parents is of course that the kids require less ""time critical"" time (its really handy to be able to say, ""I'm going to be late, you're on your own for dinner."" and to know that they will be able to make themselves a nice dinner.) And to not worry about whether or not they have a healthy lunch for school or clean clothes to wear.<p>By the time they are 18 they pretty self sufficient and that is a huge win. The trick is realizing that kids are much more capable than we often give them credit for, and they feel better about themselves when they feel they are in control of their own lives.",1350864156

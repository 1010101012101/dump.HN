172318,comment,172110,172299,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"One might also question the code in the application.  Scaling is rarely a simple issue that merely adding a new piece of gear or building a better network can solve.  If an application is slow in all of its parts, it's pretty much a hopeless endeavor to just make hardware faster.  I don't know anything about Twitters architecture (other than that it is built with RoR, which no one is going to accuse of being fast or proven with regard to scalability).  I think it's probably premature to say ""the guy failed""...maybe the application or the framework failed.  We'll see in 3 months if things have gotten significantly better, or the problems persist.",1209029119

We've recently launched a new online classified site in the UK.

For me it's an ultra-portable PC, mainly used for email+web. So when people do say things like ""It's just a phone"", they really do completely miss the point.",1209027872

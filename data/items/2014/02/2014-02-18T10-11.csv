If you look at the big auto shows from the past few years, the car manufacturers clearly do think that this going to be a major differentiator in the next years and it&#x27;s going to be average consumer models too, not just premium sports cars like today.<p>But the quad core chips we sell today will be on the road in five or more years.

Female whales hit menopause long before their lives are over, in some cases spending the majority of their lives in a non-reproductive state, which prima facie seems rather maladaptive.<p>A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain what seems like widespread evolutionary selection for menopause, and none of them are completely satisfactory. The &quot;grandmother hypothesis&quot;, for example, posits that experienced grandmothers assist in the care of their grandchildren, increasing their odds of survival.<p>Certain species of whales, including <i>Orcinus orca</i>, the killer whale, exhibit early-life menopause, and form stable matrilineal groups, making them ideal candidates for testing the grandmother hypothesis. Interestingly, studies on killer whales observe no significant correlation between living grandmothers and grandoffspring  survival rates, though there are plenty of unaddressed confounding factors.<p>Humans are the only species where the grandmother hypothesis is supported by data, but the dearth of corresponding data in whales suggests the dramatic disparity in our somatic-reproductive senescence might be more strongly selected for by factors we are not yet aware of.",1392720417

For me it&#x27;s one of the greatest example of modern German-style games.<p>(I mentioned <i>Race for the Galaxy</i> earlier, and it&#x27;s a card game only, but there&#x27;s a ton of strategy within it, and drafting + using the provided starting worlds helps mitigating the randomness out of it. (A few patch to the rules can be used as well for experienced players). Sometimes you&#x27;ll be a bit lucky or unlucky, but the upside is that with experienced players, games are short and luck averages out quickly.)<p>> I like German games a lot but I&#x27;m not a fan of the &quot;if it has dice or cards, it&#x27;s not worth playing&quot; mentality that I sometimes see. Games have a variety of social purposes. Sometimes I want to play something like Cards Against Humanity and sometimes I want to play Tigris and Euphrates. Ain&#x27;t nothing wrong with that.

One of their remarkable ability is to dive deep, fast and long.<p>Among all free diving warm blooded animals they go the deepest. They dive to depths 25 times deeper than their other equally famous and endangered cousin the blue whales. The blue whale is the largest known animal to have ever inhabited the earth.<p>To give an idea of how deep they dive, here is a picture <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/ESp2j.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/ESp2j.jpg</a> It needs to be magnified for perspective and for the little surprise at the bottom.<p>It is interesting how they manage to hold their breath for so long and yet manage to survive the bends (decompression sickness).<p>The whales are seriously challenging our assumptions about animal intelligence, empathy, society, culture and language. For a long time we believed that the primates were at the top. Search Ted talks and youtube for dolphin intelligence, dont miss the Attenborough ones. For lack of a better word they are just amazing.<p>Dolphins are for example known to build difficult to make toys (air bubble vortex rings) just to entertain themselves.<p>They have to discover how to make it. Sometimes they can be quite possessive, they would break the toy if someone not so knowledgeable wants to play with it. Once a dolphin figures it out how to make one, his/her peers eventually figure it out too. So it kind of spreads within a group like fashion. This behavior has been observed both in captivity and in the wild.<p>Dolphins in captivity try to imitate us and seem to have no trouble mapping our body parts to theirs. A story goes that a scientist observing an young dolphin from an underwater portal had blown a cloud of cigarette smoke at it. The dolphin promptly went to the mother and did the same to the scientist with milk ! It is now strongly believed that they call each other by name. They try to imitate human speech which takes enormous effort on their part because unlike for example parrots their vocal tract is not conducive for this at all. People believe this to be an indication of their strong desire to communicate with us.<p>And they originated from ungulates: hoofed warm blooded animals. It came as a surprise to me that that there were hoofed carnivorous animals.",1392718742

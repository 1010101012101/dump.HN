I think Yegge has written some decent stuff in the past (in -v mode, of course) but I doubt most of HN is interested in joining the cult.  Anybody that says ""GOSH, I SURE AM HAPPY"" while reporting to a cube has something wrong with them.<p>Build something new.",1205380431

135713,comment,135275,135275,0,0,maxwell,,,"The only way I see Google being ""superseded"" is if they cling to their business model to the extent that it jeopardizes their products. Web advertising, in its current form anyway, already looks like a sinking ship. Unlike IBM and Microsoft, Google inherently has much less user lock-in, so it'll be interesting to see what they do if their cash cow begins to seriously dry up.",1205379818
135711,comment,135185,135364,0,0,snowbird122,,,"One of the most interesting parts of the book is that it claims you should ""never criticize"" another person.  It says that every person can always justify their actions in their own mind and all criticism is taken negatively.  As an example, even mass murderers have been interviewed justifying their actions.  I tend to agree with this philosophy.",1205379501

135705,comment,135275,135368,0,0,maxwell,,,"Actually, I don't think adoption is particularly important. Really all we need is enough context to probabilistically figure out semantic meaning, and any metadata helps with that. It's not like you need some top-down data schema. Google is already doing it this way already. I don't think semantic web technologies will do much more than make their work a little easier/more accurate.",1205379183

135703,comment,135166,135688,0,0,scott_s,,,"Err, if you read Stroustrup's Design & Evolution of C++, performance clearly was one of the primary design goals. Goals 2 and 3 in the statement you linked to spell that out. If a feature could not be implemented without effecting the efficiency of programs that did not use it, the feature was rejected. One of the points that Stroustrup stresses in D&E is that he wanted no languages below C++.<p>There are many features that do have a runtime or space cost, but you only pay for it if you use it. And I think that in many cases, what you end up implementing yourself would pay the same performance costs, if not more.",1205378862

Everyone who applied had the same reasons for not applying as you do. And everyone here says: ""GOSH, I SURE AM HAPPY I CAME HERE!"" So just apply already.</i><p>And here, my friends, we have a wonderful example of something which statisticians call a ""biased sample"".  Of course the people who (a) were offered a job by Google, (b) accepted said offer from Google, and (c) haven't quit, are happy about having interviewed at Google.<p>If Steve Yegge had (a) gone to Facebook and interviewed ex-googlers, (b) phoned people who were offered jobs but decided not to accept them (yes, we do exist), or (c) talked to people who flew across the country to interview at Google but weren't offered jobs, he would probably hear a rather more complicated story.",1205378414

From the screenshots at Amazon, it looks like the Kindle application for PC also takes you to the browser.<p>In-app purchasing is a standard, supported feature of the iPhone/iPad SDK.

1376116,comment,1375703,1375882,0,0,dangoor,,,"Thanks for the comments! Very interesting to hear about your experiences.<p>I'm the product manager for Bespin, so I'd certainly be happy to say a couple of things about the status.<p>Since the Bespin that you've used, we've been putting a <i>ton</i> of effort into the infrastructure on the client side. We intend to keep pushing on the client side until it's an editor that is very competitive with desktop editors. Right now, there are still some gaps we need to fill in (for example, the editor doesn't support real tabs). But the infrastructure we have has firmed up very nicely. It's got the potential for lots of interesting plugins. Our keyboard system supports pluggable keybindings (just waiting for someone to come along and build up emacs and vi :) We've got an Embedded package that's easy to hook up to whatever site/server you need to.<p>And that's where the server change referred to here comes from. We're going to redo the server with an eye toward people running their own Bespins, which eliminates scalability and security concerns that make it hard to implement the most useful Bespin possible.<p>There are many people using Bespin in their own applications today, and that package just keeps getting better. For the folks like you using the full server, there will be a dip in functionality, but in the end you'll be able to get a Bespin server that can do anything you care to make it do via plugins.",1274748982

A lot of that time has been reading code, and a lot of that code is comments that say TODO.  If you are thinking about using its editor as a drop-in to your project, think twice!  Its code highlighting is not template-driven and has hard-coded values in several different files.  None of this is documented, at least not in any place that i found.  There are theme files, but changing them does not change the actual presentation =(.  Further, there are no plans or aspirations to support IE.  Further still, it does not support multiple editors per-page, so you have to manually manage the buildup and teardown -- this may not be an issue depending on your use-case.

1376089,comment,1375909,1375909,0,0,CodeMage,,,"So basically the new Hotmail is mostly the same as the old Hotmail, but:<p>1) It offers you some of the features GMail already has, like the conversation view.<p>2) It does <i>not</i> offer you some of the features GMail does, such as labels. By the way, you can tell that the author doesn't really understand labels, because he claims that the archiving is the same as deleting.<p>3) It offers you some dubious features that GMail does not have. Preview, for example, is something I find utterly useless. If I can't glean what the e-mail is about from either the subject or the short text preview GMail offers, then it can generally wait for me to open it. However, I'm aware that this is just my personal preference. What really flabbergasted me was the ""Sweep"" feature. I don't know whether the author described it well, but if he did, then I don't understand why he thinks it's so great. Maybe I'm a pessimist, but I think it's naive to trust in software's ability to guess what your criteria is for deleting future messages ""like"" the ones you marked.<p>4) It offers some preconfigured filters and views that GMail doesn't. Some of these things sound really useful, especially filtering by senders from your contact list.<p>Here's one of the things the new Hotmail doesn't seem to have, that I consider GMail's killer feature (apart from the whole awesome labels+filters paradigm): Labs. I absolutely love multiple inboxes and superstars. Also, the new Google Apps integration with GMail is a huge plus. Finally, let's not forget that GMail's spam filter, in my experience, works better than Hotmail's spam filter ever did. I don't think Hotmail will be giving GMail ""a run for its money"" anytime soon.",1274747534

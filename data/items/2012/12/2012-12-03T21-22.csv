The levers on the sockets have gotten much better, as have the HSF mountpoints, and inserting a CPU and attaching the HSF has not made me feel like I'm going to break the motherboard for many years (let alone actually broken it - I can remember boards where you had to jam a screwdriver into the heatsink retention bracket and apply pressure towards the motherboard... I'm getting cold sweats just thinking about it)<p>> You also have to manually add thermal protections like fans, heat sinks, thermal paste, etc., which all require selection and installation<p>Thermal paste is optional, if the CPU and heatsink make good contact it doesn't make so much difference. You don't have to select if you buy retail boxes instead of OEM, which come with HSFs already selected for you in the box, and with thermal gunk pre-applied.<p>I do agree that it's rare to upgrade the CPU and not motherboard, but you could say the same thing about most of the components in my PC (I tend to upgrade all at once).<p>As for trickiest, most delicate part of building your own pc... honestly if you're installing the CPU into the motherboard before putting into the case, I would have to disagree with you there.",1354571626

Since the banks all provide credit through these card providers, there's very little competition.<p>There are numerous ways to virtually eliminate CC fraud but the card providers aren't interested in taking those measures, and neither are the big retailers. They are happy to accept the ~5% loss on chargebacks, because credit card users spend something like 30-40% more per transaction than cash payers.<p>What we need is a competitor that disrupts credit cards altogether, not just merchant processing. Eliminate VISA and MC, who are basically skimming 2.5% off our retail economy. Cards are obsolete anyways. The processing side is obsolete, we don't need terminals that dial into a central processing machine, we can use the internet. The credit side (banks provide the credit line you get on your card, not Visa/MC) will take a bit more work, but we can combine it with the rise in peer to peer lending: you seek a credit line from a crowdlending site, not Chase bank.",1354571378

Salary is deferred when it would ordinarily be due immediately but is paid later. Formally, a deferred salary is a commitment to pay a precise amount of money at some point in the future. Colloquially, any promise of compensation that would ordinarily be due in the next pay period but will instead come 1-2 years from now at ""exit"" is a deferred payment.<p>Your reasoning about ""Series C"" versus ""Series A"" startups and salary expectations is also suspect. We pay market salaries to a large number of very talented, very specialized engineers and haven't raised a dollar of funding.<p>The problem with your reasoning is that it isn't based on the market, but rather on some kind of status hierarchy about startups. The mistake I think you're making is that you frame things in terms of ""90k and a huge chunk of equity"", rather than ""your market rate of 150k, 2/3rds in salary, 1/3rd in equity, risk-adjusted based on expected liquidity from revenues we forecast at N, N+1, N+k over the next k quarters, at acquisition multiple y"".<p>If you write the blog post that way, so that you can make a case that a 150k candidate is effectively demanding 300k, your post starts to make sense (but it's a little boring, right?). But when you write it in terms of ""Series A employees should get 90k"", you go way off the rails.<p><i>Later edit: you can also reason through your equity valuation with a candidate the way 'ChuckMcM does, but it seems like to do that honestly, your equity would need to be liquid enough that you could place another x00,000 shares; in particular, you can't just treat your last valuation as gospel; just like your B investors can reduce your valuation, so can candidates.</i>",1354569931

When we talk about residential bandwidth, congestion isn't the issue so much as competitive access is. It's not that AT&T and Comcast have the best access, they just got there first and are able to block other competitors.<p>Throttling will make the ISPs more money, but it doesn't help consumers or solve this problem.<p>I think this might be explicitly what you're looking for: At the pricing and access tiers available today it is virtually impossible to saturate and block a local connection (at the residential level) such that you impact other subscribers at a regional level.<p>Throttling doesn't solve this problem it just reduces usage. ISPs have the overall goal of reducing usage because it increases profit. The logical fallacy is that while your model proposes an ISP that would want to give everyone as much as speed as possible, the reality is that all ISPs want users to use as little bandwidth as possible.<p>Does that help?

Counter $150K/yr, 100K shares.
My counter $150K/yr, no equity.<p>This is this math, I've got a fixed amount of money in the bank, its going toward zero. I can sell your 100,000 shares to one of our investors for $2/share, giving the company $200,000 which I will then pay out to you $50K per year on top of your $100,000 a year salary. You get $150K per year, the investor gets the 100,000 shares. Or I can give the 100,000 shares to you with a strike price of $0.25/share, vesting over 4 years. So at the end of the four years you will have one of three outcomes.<p>1) $130,000 in the bank  (that is $50 - 35% marginal tax rate) * four years.<p>2) A right to buy $xxxK of stock for $25,000.<p>3) A different job.<p>So realistically the stock needs to be worth $300K and saleable for you to make money. ($300K - $25K exercise - approx $137.50K in taxes) So $3/share. If I have investors willing to pay $2/share for common stock today, you (the engineer) need to believe that in four years the common stock will become 50% more valuable. You've got to ask yourself one question, ""Do I feel lucky?""<p>For lots of people though its also more 'fun' to work in a startup in terms of engaging problems to solve and level of impact on the company is involved.",1354569432

It's hard to give it a hard date like Kickstarter since it's not the people <i>doing</i> who create the posts.<p>The best way I can think of going about it is having people say how much they're willing to pay (but no money changes hands), allowing someone to say they're going to implement and idea, and then it turns into a kickstarter project and emails all of the people who said they'd pay so they can enter their credit card details.<p>That way there's no risk for the backers (until they know someone wants to fulfill their dreams) or creator's (functions just like kickstarter for them -- except someone is giving them an initial list of interested parties). The websites whole purpose becomes facilitating new ideas.<p>To cut down on spam, you could charge people a dollar per vote (or microtransactions) and then promise creators a cut of that if they successfully ""kickstart"" a project (or convert a sufficient number of voting backers).<p>* To be clear: I'm not talking about using kickstarter -- then you'd lose all your revenue.<p>Edit: I expected pvsh to be about ""I want this thing"" instead of feature requests for specific products.

That number is your floor, not your ceiling.<p>At a financed, leveraged startup, you're not going to get that number in cash. But you need to get that number, risk-adjusted, in some fashion. Generally, engineers should not expect to be ""worth less"" to startups. They're just compensated using different instruments.<p>The problem with berating engineers for framing comp discussions in terms of their going rate is that engineers can't value equity the way founders can. It's an asymmetric information problem. The founders know more about the value of their equity and have more control over the variables that will change those values. So the onus is on the company, <i>not</i> the candidate, to justify the equity grants being used to offset salary.<p>The way that should probably work for most startups is a conversation about expected future revenues. Acquired startups aren't really valued in terms of forward revenue multiples, but that is the scoring system used by most bystanders to evaluate a deal. So a compensation discussion that involves equity should involve quarterly revenue projections and a notion of what multiple of that revenue the company might be acquired at (or, if you're shooting for Mars and not the moon, where you'd IPO at --- but the IPO story is usually so B.S. that it's a warning sign).<p>A founder who can't have that conversation with a candidate or can't do it convincingly has no business trying to sell equity to a candidate. Which, make no mistake, is exactly what founders are doing when they compensate employees with equity: they are selling stock in their company, and it's the least valuable stock in the company.",1354569080

hyperpot,0,1,0.0,1,0,"Hyperpot is created to make the richest search engine optimization platform on the web. We just launched the website a month ago and there are only several tools available right now. Buying keywords from our website is the key to access other parts of the website, like link exchanging with others who have purchased keywords at the website (keyword holders), reaching the resource\ncenter (published articles, research papers about search engines and their technologies), joining the test center where search engine tricks will be discussed, tested and revealed.<p>HyperPot is a project that combines data analytics and relevant keyword algorithms with artificial intelligence research in order to improve search engine visibility. This hyperlink tool, then, aims to enable bloggers and webmasters to redefine specific keywords for better and higher search engine results.<p>The system involves purchasing words and activating them for your site. Alternatively, you can resort to word combination in the event the word you are interested in is already occupied. Sentences can also be employed, but only if they are accompanied by a dash.<p>In addition to that, the site aims to include articles and research papers about search engine optimization, as well as SEO tools such as keyword trend analyzers, traffic stats, social media tracking, popularity.",1235969302,1452887176

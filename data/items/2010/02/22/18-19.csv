It doesn't seem all that unfair that the employee now has a somewhat greater obligation to the company, particularly since the employee chose this route.<p>Similarly, my sister's employer invested several grand in training her in Crossfit. She is now obligated to teach Crossfit for a year at a fixed wage, or else repay (12 - # of months worked)/12 x 100% of her training costs. Is that also ""bonded labor""?",1266865046
1143418,comment,1143270,1143270,0,0,tjr,,,"I graduated from high school in 1998. My grandfather, wanting me to learn something about business, gave me $500 to invest in the stock market. Java programming was hip at the time, and I decided to put the money into Sun Microsystems, resulting in ten shares.<p>A few months later, my grandfather passed away, so suddenly the stock wasn't just stock, but was also his final gift to me. I watched the stock double in value, go through several stock splits, and eventually my $500 investment was worth around $6000. But, due to emotional attachment, I didn't want to sell.<p>The dotCom boom turned into the dotCom bust, and my Sun stock gradually sank back down. At their request, in 2008 I mailed back my stock certificates as part of their ""reverse stock split"", and in 2010 (just a couple of weeks ago) I received in the mail a check for $190 from Oracle Corporation, as Sun is now no more.<p>Had my grandfather been here, he surely would have advised me to sell the stock when it was valued in the thousands of dollars, and had I known that in the end the stock would be reduced to a check for $190 from a different company, I reckon I would have decided to sell it myself.<p>So what did I learn?  Don't get emotionally attached to a stock, or to a company, or to anything of that nature. Companies come and go. If you can make the world (or even your little piece of it) better by selling a stock, then consider selling it. The memories I have of my grandfather are far more precious to me than the stock, or the $190, or the potential for $6000, but I let emotions (and maybe a bit of stubbornness) persuade me otherwise for a decade.<p>Deal with facts. Find out what the company is doing and planning to do. Find out how well the company is managed, and if you do buy stock, keep up on how well the company is managed. If it looks like some new CEO is going to drive the company into the ground, that might be a good time to get out, even if the company is still making some cool product that you like.<p>For me, I tend to shy away from buying individual stocks now. There is great potential for great success, but there is also great potential for great failure. I like to think I have better odds at becoming wealthy by creatively working hard rather than by picking stocks, so most of my stock investments are spread across a variety of funds. Even those can turn sour quick, but in most cases, not as sour as quickly as an individual stock can.",1266865033

Some  of  these  go  back  quite  a ways; the TMRC Dictionary\n   includes an entry which implies that the plural of `mouse' is meeces,\n   and  notes  that  the  defined plural of `caboose' is `cabeese'. This\n   latter  has  apparently  been  standard (or at least a standard joke)\n   among railfans (railroad enthusiasts) for many years\n\n   On  a  similarly  Anglo-Saxon note, almost anything ending in `x' may\n   form  plurals  in `-xen' (see VAXen and boxen in the main text). Even\n   words  ending  in  phonetic /k/ alone are sometimes treated this way;\n   e.g.,  `soxen'  for  a  bunch  of  socks. Other funny plurals are the\n   Hebrew-style `frobbotzim' for the plural of `frobbozz' (see frobnitz)\n   and `Unices' and `Twenices' (rather than `Unixes' and `Twenexes'; see\n   Unix,  TWENEX in main text). But note that `Twenexen' was never used,\n   and  `Unixen' was not sighted in the wild until the year 2000, thirty\n   years  after  it  might  logically  have  come  into use; it has been\n   suggested  that  this  is  because `-ix' and `-ex' are Latin singular\n   endings  that  attract  a  Latinate  plural. Among Perl hackers it is\n   reported  that  `comma'  and  `semicolon'  pluralize as `commata' and\n   `semicola'  respectively.  Finally,  it has been suggested to general\n   approval that the plural of `mongoose' ought to be `polygoose'.\n\n   The  pattern  here,  as  with  other  hackish  grammatical quirks, is\n   generalization  of  an inflectional rule that in English is either an\n   import  or  a  fossil (such as the Hebrew plural ending `-im', or the\n   Anglo-Saxon  plural  suffix  `-en')  to cases where it isn't normally\n   considered to apply.\n\n   This is not `poor grammar', as hackers are generally quite well aware\n   of  what  they  are  doing  when  they  distort  the  language. It is\n   grammatical  creativity,  a  form  of  playfulness. It is done not to\n   impress but to amuse, and never at the expense of clarity.\n</code></pre>\n- Jargon File",1266864846

After all, manipulating our environment might not be proof enough; it could be argued that we still do it as an automatic response, simply working together as a species to propagate the species and still ultimately motivated in all our actions by innate, animalistic desires. It can easily be argued that the only fundamental difference between humans and other animals is simply the complexity of our interactions with our environment. Even the things we hold up as proof of transcendence from the animal world are likely just adaptations, eg, what we consider an impulse to develop ethical systems is just an adaptation of the brain to keep individuals working in the interest of the species.<p>Furthermore, imagine these hypothetical creatures had a better understanding of what we consider ""souls,"" death and even pain.

1143378,comment,1141707,1142061,0,0,jrockway,,,"I agree.  C is weird in that the programmer has to throw away almost all of his intent and just tells the machine exactly what instructions to perform.  You can read C and sort of get the idea of what the programmer <i>wanted</i> to do, but it's difficult.  In Haskell, there is very little ""how"" and a lot of ""what"" (and ""why""), and so there is much more opportunity for optimization.  Your work with stream fusion is a great example -- what a C programmer might think is a bunch of loops can be condensed down to one loop ""sometime later"".  And in Haskell, these effects can be composed, whereas in C, you are stuck with what the programmer wrote.<p>This is why I am always confused when people say ""functional programming is slow"" -- current C implementations are very close to being as fast as theoretically possible, where as current FP implementations are nowhere near that (there are many optimization opportunities that are currently unexplored or unimplemented).  And even with only a few optimizations, many FP implementations (GHC, OCaml, SBCL) are almost as fast as C already!",1266864011

If your idea is valuable, others will (hopefully) be willing to pay royalties. If not, you'll be discouraged from filing fluff patents in the future.<p>If fees start low and escalate every year, there's much more of a game theory aspect. On the inventor side, you have an incentive to apply for 10 silly patents and play the lottery on each for a year instead of filing for 1 good patent that is actually valuable. On the other side, someone considering paying to use a patent might think ""Gee, if we make a deal now, we have to pay royalties, but if we wait a year, then there's a good chance Joe Patentholder will not be able to pay the required fees, and then we can use his idea for free!"" This doesn't mean Joe's idea is not valuable, but the incentive to wait a few months makes a patent's value too unpredicatable.<p>Also, what if you're negotiating with someone after 2 years and 11 months, and they decide to stall for a month to apply negotiating pressure?",1266863819

For a cheap example, take two pharmaceutical compounds, one that works better in 1mg doses and another that works better on 100mg doses. Should the second be a hundred times as expensive as the first or not? Or suppose someone devises a new way of manufacturing battery cells that are exactly equal to current batteries except the process is a lot cheaper. The fee would apply one-time to the company that used this patented process or would it apply to all products built with this process? And how would, say, the fees of a 9volt and an AAA battery be balanced?<p>So I guess the patent system is too broad for its own good.",1266862383

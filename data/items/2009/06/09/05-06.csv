648601,comment,648277,648547,0,0,donaq,,,"Hmm, allow me to elaborate.<p>1) In his point about DRY, he speaks of humans not remembering very well. It seems unlikely that he would be referring to written communication here, since there would be no need for memory on the part of the audience. It's pretty much why writing was invented. To implement DRY for speaking.<p>2) <i>Let people be people -- let them be vague and a little incorrect -- listen more for the gist of what they're saying than the exact terminology.<p>Be a compassionate speaker, a compassionate listener. Embrace the 'all too human' aspects of the strange bipeds you interact with.</i><p>""Listening"" and ""speaking"" tend to be used to refer to verbal communication.<p>3) References to real-time, in-the-flesh actions and reactions, i.e. ""yelling"", ""watch as the eyes glaze over"" and ""look at us with that 'freak' expression"".<p>I do agree that if we subscribe to a literal interpretation of the post, then these points may not be conclusive, but then that would just prove the OP's point that us programmers find it hard to deal with ambiguity in communication. I don't know if that was a conscious intention on his part, but if it is, it's quite clever, especially given the reactions I mentioned in my first comment.<p>Of course, there's also the possibility that I am wrong, in which case, I've read too much into his post. :)",1244526845

But it's sometimes less understandable what somebody is trying to say, when I'm in ""strict thinking"" mode.<p>It's the same with switching between natural languages - I've once met foreigner in Poland in place where I wouldn't think he can be. He was talking to me in English for more than a minute before I've recognized that I must mentaly switch to English to understand him :)<p>I think social contacts are difficult for programmers, because programming does not require listening to anybody.",1244526817

648597,comment,647905,648359,0,0,Gary_W_Longsine,,,"You won't ""take a hit"", but you will ""fail to utilize the hardware as efficiently as you could"".  Both GCD and OpenCL have their roots in open extensions to C.  Both offer potentially significant performance gains for certain types of tasks.  If enough developers find it advantageous to use either blocks or OpenCL, these technologies will likely show up on other platforms.<p>Regarding the scheduler, I'm not sure enough details are known outside of Apple at this point to know what the results would be on Snow Leopard.  Your milage would obviously vary when porting to some other OS.  It's easy to imagine that running a PThreads app might hog some cores, or be punished inappropriately by the scheduler.  These things can happen when running more than one threaded app on a system today, without GCD.  This behavior, even if not documented, should be relatively easy to explore with some simple demo apps, though, without porting your entire app.<p>And, uhm... you will need to refactor your application to take advantage of the new API.  (Was that a trick question?)  Apple's guidance indicates that you can make modest changes for big gains by focusing the refactoring effort on the parts of the app that do the most computationally.  For some apps this can be a small amount of work for a large gain, particularly if you can take advantage of OpenCL as well as GCD.",1244526617

Where the original artists will always get a percentage of the work from every sale. As the work gets resold, always for a higher value, the artist gets a cut each time.<p>Good for artists, ok for collectors, good for government controlling artists.<p>To counter your argument - the market does not get reduced - but the artists also get a cut.<p>I'm not sure of all the sociological research that went into this policy, but it seems very sensible. I also know that it is backed up with scientific research - so you can look up the reasoning behind it.<p>I know some of the research was that many artists sell their work for almost nothing, and the collectors make most of the money. This has been going on for a long time. Consider Van Gogh who lived in poverty for all of his life... even though his work has generated many millions of euros. If this law was in place, he would have perhaps been able to share in some of the value his work produced(money wise).<p>Places like Sweden and Australia are way ahead in many areas socially compared the the US. Especially in the area of copyright, and helping artists. Sweden is a world leader socially, so paying close attention to what they do, and the scientific research behind their social policies is worthwhile.<p>Even though this seat is a political victory, it shows a deep understanding of the issues by the Swedish people - who are a very well educated population.",1244525564

This makes little sense unless the activity of blogging is simply for commercial success. I really don't think that's a well-meaning attempt at understanding the wide community of blogging and the nature of on-again off-again bloggers who make up a large percentage.<p>This includes myself. I've had several blogs, and currently I don't blog. None of my blogs was a ""failure"". At each new juncture I had found a new voice in my writing and my previous work was no longer of interest to me to have out there. This is not the experience of all bloggers, it's just my experience.<p>I expect to blog again soon. But with new social networking mediums, such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, each with quite a different flavor and audience, I find that some things that previously would have made a blog entry make more sense as a twitter, or are more appropriate on Facebook, and so on. The article almost, but not completely, misses this complexity to social networking.<p>It is also my completely non-scientific impression that the New York Times more frequently contains a negative take on blogging in general. It would be interesting to analyze that and see if it's actually true or not, it just seems to be the case as far as I can tell.",1244524165

Then I get weird looks but you end up grabbing their attention, sometimes they find the word for you, and other times the vocabulary comes back to you a few sentences later.<p>In the above example, I didn't find the word, but thankfully the point made its way across.

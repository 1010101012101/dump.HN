598732,comment,598259,598410,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Not to get into an argument not medically qualified, but as some who has extensive experience with both recreational and clinical drug use, asciilifeform makes some good points here.<p>Yes, it's absurd that psychiatry often doesn't involve any blood tests, which really makes to hard to take seriously as a medical discipline. I've had both good and bad psychiatrists, but it's hard to escape the conclusion that 'fill this prescription, tell me how it's working in a month' is not much more than licensed drug dealing. SSRIs and suchlike are designed to build up their effect over time rather than supplying instant chemical gratification, which is a good idea, but as medical tools I think they're fairly half-assed.<p>Between study, experience, and practice at observing my reactions, I feel moderately competent to monitor my own brain chemistry, at least as well as any lay person can. Mapping out the metabolic curve of a drug in the body isn't so terribly hard and SSRIs feel very much like the chemical equivalent of treating the symptom rather than the cause. In short, they seem to flatten affect, such that the amplitude of yuor mood swings is reduced and you don't care how you're feeling to the same degree as normal. On several occasions I've taken a course, been quit disappointed, and come off them - subsequent improvement, if any, has more to do with increased self-regard for having taken action to address the problem.<p>I do feel, strongly, that dopamine deficiency is part of my particular problem - and as pointed out, the clinical options there are somewhat limited. It's on reason I still smkoe; nicotine is a very effective dopamine agonist. Unfortunately, it's brought me to first-stage emphysema and every time I light up my lungs ask me why there isn't a better way. Although I have been diagnosed with moderately several Adult ADHD (via interviews and tests...another example of the medical catching-up psychiatry needs), my doctor's been rather reluctant to break out the Adderall or suchlike because he worries there might be a potential for abuse. At his hourly rate, I don't argue, but frankly I'm OK with it because it can hardly be worse than tarring my lungs. My past experience with illegal stimulants like cocaine is that they're quite enjoyable but don't exercise any significant compulsion on me. I took the latter  semi-regularly for a while but got bored with staying in and having the same wired conversation with my roommate, so I just dropped it.<p>Just my anecdotal perspective. I find it depressingly easy to understand why so many people wind up 'on drugs'. They work, but it's <i>infra dig</i> to start your clinical approach from there.",1241732658
598731,comment,597904,597977,0,0,agrinshtein,,,"Just to put a little twist on this discussion.<p>I never understood alternate theories of how the world came into being. I never understood the theory of Evolution, nor the Big Bang Theory.  My logic has always led me to conclude that there must be a G-d.<p>Disclaimer: What I have to say is so simple, that due to its simplicity people may tend to discredit it.  As a group of Hackers though, I figure you will appreciate the  simplicity.  Realize that this topic is much simpler than Philosophers/Scientists like to make it. (If things were so simple philosophers would be out of a profession:-))<p>Disclaimer #2: These types of discussions are usually a waste of time because for some reason people have emotional attachments to either side.  I figure that this is a group of intellectuals who may be able to divorce their emotional attachments from this discussion and talk about basic logic and sensibility.<p>There is a basic logical axiom that everything we understand, everything that we can quantify, everything we can touch with the fingers of our hands or the 'fingers' of our minds must come from somewhere.  Everyone agrees that the table that their computer is sitting on was put there by someone, was built by someone, or manufactured by something.  Anything definable must have a source. Your table. Your computer. Your actions. Your feelings. Your thoughts. A tiny atom.<p>Based on this axiom we ask ourselves the age old question, ""What is the source of this world?"" Generations have grappled with this question.  People ponder this question. Solutions are offered.  Evolution.  The Big Bang Theory. So on and so forth.<p>I don't understand them.<p>Evolution.  We evolved from something. Go back to the first thing.  Whether it was an atom or a quark or anything else.  Can you define it? If it is, than you still have the question, ""How did that get there?!"" Remember, anything definable falls under the axiom of needing a source.  Where did that first thing come from?<p>Big Bang. Same question.  Where did all of the matter that came together to create the 'big bang' come from? There was matter? How did it get there?<p>So we track back.  We have a world.  How did it get here? There must have been 'something', alright, we don't know what that something was but it was something.  So where did that 'something' come from? Alright, so 'something' created that 'something' which created the world.  Alright, well what created THAT 'something', you get the drift.<p>However, here is the catch.  You already don't know what that something is.  You can't define that something.  So now who says that 'something' is bound by the axiom of having to have had a source.  Once you are dealing with a dimension beyond your comprehension you are no longer able to ascribe rules that applied in a dimension that you did comprehend! Rules that applied here, can not be applied there.<p>G-d is that something.  G-d created the world.  'Something' created the world.<p>What is G-d? The moment I give any sort of definition I have left what S/He is.  G-d isn't anything. G-d is everything and nothing - at the same time.  You ask how that works? You can't ask that.  You have just committed the same mistake that you were trying to avoid.  Applying a set of logic to a dimension you have no conception of whatsoever.  The question of where does G-d come from doesn't apply.  The question of how can I say G-d is nothing and everything at the same time doesn't apply.<p>This is just a tip of the iceberg.  There is more to say but for the sake of this discussion I think that this is sufficient.<p>(What I mean when I say that this is just the tip of the iceberg...in Judaism there is a very large study that discusses the inner workings of creation and it is a fascinating study. For example, Dan Benjamin - Hivelogic - recently put up a post about meditation.  I found it interesting.  In Chassidut/Kabbalah one of the faculties of the soul are the ""Ruach"" which literally means breath in Hebrew. It is one of the more external aspects of the soul.  These concepts of breath and tuning into a deeper part of your psyche/soul than the standard drone of day to day life allow are basic basic concepts in Chassidic/Kabbalistic thought)",1241732654

I know the charter system caused huge political fights here in Massachusetts because, after being given a few years to get established, they began taking money from the ""regular"" public schools on a per-student-enrolled basis.<p>Many of those charter schools were consistently posting state test results that surpassed the ""regular"" public schools' by a wide margin.  We later learned that at least some of those charter schools were exercising their freedom to kick out students for whom they felt the experiment wasn't working by return to the mainstream schools the ones who weren't doing well on their exam preparation.<p>So, at least here, there is an ugly side too.  It is unfortunate, because the ability to experiment and determine what works the best is something we're capable of doing in the US (it's so huge).

6546284,comment,6545923,6545923,15,0,patio11,,,"This feels less like a framework bug for me than an app bug -- an impressively common app bug, I&#x27;ll grant you, but an app bug nonetheless.  Rails doesn&#x27;t ship with user management.  It&#x27;s pretty upfront about that, and the docs tell you to roll your own since it is easy, and the community will tell you to use Devise since that will save you time since you&#x27;ll be doing repetitive work for substantially all apps otherwise.<p>The typical way beginning Rails developers (including me, on my first Rails apps) would implement logins is stuffing the user ID in session[:user_id] and setting the currently logged in user to that when it is both present and in the DB.<p>It is true that this approach will make sessions replayable.  It will also:<p>1)  Make it impossible to <i>reliably</i> expire session, since the user&#x27;s browser is not under your control and may treat the expiration date as advisory only.<p>2)  Make it impossible to <i>forcibly</i> expire session, which you&#x27;ll want to do in event of a user changing or resetting their password, changing their username/email address, etc.  (Generic security advice for all web apps, by the way.  Otherwise compromise of user accounts, via losing password, XSS, or what have you, is impossible to reverse.)<p>3)  Makes it impossible to implement Sign Me Out Of All Devices, which is a very desirable capability to have for many applications.  For example, if you have a more-important-than-cat-videos app, somebody losing their phone should <i>probably</i> not result in their account on your service being irrevocably compromised.  You could provide a Dropbox-esque UI to manage their state across multiple devices or, in a pinch, just say &quot;If you hit the log out button on any device, we log you out of all devices.&quot;<p>4)  The simplest possible Rails login system is facially non-compliant with a number of security regimes you might be under, including HIPAA among others.<p>n.b. Switching to ActiveRecordStore doesn&#x27;t by itself solve anything but #1.  You do need app-side logic.",1381744254

Many Communist countries chugged right along, growing their economies at a pace that alarmed Western observers, before they sagged and broke down under their increasingly cruel, incompetent, kleptomaniacal, bureaucratic government systems. But before this happened people were afraid Communism could actually <i>win</i>. When Khrushchev said &quot;we will bury you&quot; people took him seriously. But if von Mises was right they should never have gotten anywhere in the first place. Also consider that the internal economy of any real-world corporation is &#x27;centrally planned&#x27; in a limited sense. When you call up the HR department or tech support, you don&#x27;t have to pay them for their labor.<p>Hayek was the Austrian that got it right--it&#x27;s not that central planning is inefficient, it&#x27;s that efficient central planning for a broad market economy can only be accomplished when you begin to devalue the actions of the humans of the world that aren&#x27;t in line with what the planners want. Eventually, what is lost is all incentives for planners to plan for anyone but themselves. This goes all the way back to Marx, who would talk about things like how capitalists as a <i>social class</i> do not really provide &#x27;labor value&#x27;; that the capitalist even makes money at all is an accident of human organization and that they are not really valuable or needed in the world.

The reality was very different (via WP):<p><i>&quot;The &quot;London ultimatum&quot; in May 1921 demanded reparations in gold or foreign currency to be paid in annual installments of 2,000,000,000 (2 billion) goldmarks plus 26 percent of the value of Germany&#x27;s exports.[6]&quot;</i><p>The Weimar government had no choice but to keep shovelling hard currency across the border to France while simultaneously being limited in its ability to earn more. This looks, economically, like a huge trade imbalance which drove down the value of the Mark, and the printing started as an attempt to keep up with the rapidly collapsing exchange rate.<p>It was not so much an experiment as an act of desparation by a government that was being looted at gunpoint.<p>Just as famine in the modern world is a political problem rather than primarily an agricultural one, hyperinflation is driven by political or economic collapse rather than some vaguely defined irresponsibility.

6546130,comment,6543791,6544371,7,0,antimagic,,,"<i>Cargo cult is the result of a trap that our own brain seem to be wired to fall in.</i><p>Yeah, tell me about it.  I fell into the trap a couple of months ago.  I was tasked with porting my company&#x27;s browser&#x27;s 2D graphics backend onto Android OpenGL.  My first attempt allowed the browser to draw into graphics buffers that I would load into a texture using glTexImage2D.<p>A few co-workers felt that this was less efficient than the old 2D APIs, where we would draw into a buffer that would be directly read by the blitter hardware, without having to do a load step.  I agreed - on the face of it, if we could arrange things to draw into the texture buffer directly we could save memory and processor cycles, so I started hunting on the Internet to see if anyone else had come to the same conclusion.<p>It turns out that the guys that were developing Firefox for Android had had exactly the same problem, and they hacked together a solution where they used some internal Android APIs for graphic buffers, that  they accessed through dlopen/dlsym.  They then linked the buffer to an eglImage, and created a texture from the eglImage.  I figured that hey, if the Firefox guys are doing it, then it&#x27;s probably not to bad an idea.<p>Unfortunately I should have taken the next step in my investigations, and ask myself exactly what that code that created an eglImage and linked it to a texture was actually doing.  If I had investigated that more closely, I would have realised that behind the scenes there&#x27;s an implicit equivalent of glTexImage2D being done - the problem being that the internal format of a texture is not a simple bitmap.  The image is tiled so that OpenGL can draw a texture to the screen with any rotation and have roughly the same performance - if you use a standard bitmap layout, memory paging makes drawing tall thin rectangles much slower than drawing wide short rectangles.  So, for OpenGL (or at least OpenGL ES) to be able to draw the texture to the screen, it first reads the data in from the eglImage, tiling it as it goes.  This is exactly the same workload that you have in glTexImage2D, and it requires you to keep two copies of the buffer - the one you draw into, and the one that has been tiled for OpenGL.<p>Anyway, it took me about a month to get the eglImage solution to work (apart from everything else, you are exposed to odd behaviour by the graphics libraries of each Android tablet that your code runs on, that you have to write special code to handle, ie it&#x27;s not very portable as a solution).  Once I realised that I wasn&#x27;t actually gaining anything from the exercise, I had to go and rip out all of that native graphic buffer code, and put back in the original standard texture code.  I probably wasted 6 weeks stuffing around with all of this.<p>Lesson learned - if you are worrying about optimising code, you need to understand what is being done by the compiler / hardware, and it is pointless changing code until you <i>have</i> that understanding.  Don&#x27;t just accept stuff that you read on the Internet, where possible you need to go and look at source code, or official documentation.  Anything else is running the risk of cargo-culting.",1381741510

6546124,comment,6544152,6544554,1,0,twic,,,"I work on a system split into 4-6 applications, depending on what you consider to be part of the system. We have a tier of integration tests that run across several of them. I can confirm that it is indeed often dreadful.<p>At the moment, we don&#x27;t use VMs, we just fire up multiple servers on the same box. They use different ports, so it&#x27;s no big deal. The tests are framed as being for one particular application in the system (eg a test that asserts that the front-end server displays the right profit and loss is a test for the front-end server, even though it uses the price server and the calculation server). Tests for a given application will use the current checkout of that application&#x27;s code, and obtain packaged versions of the other applications from our internal artifact store. Tests always uses the latest versions of those available; the assumption is that the latest version will have been deployed by the time the code under test is deployed.<p>There are plenty of things that the multiple-apps-on-one-box approach doesn&#x27;t test, mostly around networking, so we are trying to get our VM tooling up to speed to run multiple VMs instead. We already use the tooling to deploy VMs for apps in production, but it needs some tweaking to work well on desktops and in CI. It&#x27;s not clear that this approach will completely replace the multiple-apps-on-one-box approach, because of the overhead in starting the VMs. We&#x27;ll play it by ear.<p>Some of the dreadfulness of this approach comes from mismatches between test and production around versioning and networking. Most of it comes from the fact that in practice, it is much harder to track down the source of an error than when testing a single monolithic application.<p>Now, it could be the case that this pain, and the other pain resulting from splitting a system into multiple small applications, is worth it, because that splitting brings other advantages. I don&#x27;t have a parallel version of our system implemented as a monolith, so i can&#x27;t tell you if that&#x27;s true. I have serious doubts about it, though.",1381741392

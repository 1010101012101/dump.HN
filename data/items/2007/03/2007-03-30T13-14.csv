7553,comment,638,638,0,0,Tichy,,,"It is easy to come up with ideas, but some ideas are better than others. Maybe I can agree to the level that ""ideas in nuthsells"" are worthless. For example anyone can have the idea to ""create a really elegant computer"", yet most people agree that only Steve Jobs can pull it off (just look at the TV computer design challenge by intel - so depressing). But I think in his mind the idea is more than just the nutshell description. And having THAT right idea doesn't seem to be trivial to me.

I used to work for a big enterprise software company, and it took me a while to get used to the fact that we're selling crappy software for millions of $ a piece.
I think the problem is that large enterprises trust other large organizations to solve their problems. You can't really get ahead in a large enterprise and become a manager with a budget to spend on software solutions unless you have that kind of organizational mindset. You fear change and fear failure, and so you'd rather spend tons of cash on a crappy solution from someone ""trustworthy"" - so they can't blame you if the software you bought sucks, than on a small startup's product that no one else in your industry is using.
BTW, Crossing the Chasm is a good book on the subject. I recommend it to anyone considering going into enterprise software.",1175261704

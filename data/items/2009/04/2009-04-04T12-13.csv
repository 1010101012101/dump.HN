It's not any one thing in particular, it's just that it has inherited that big and Enterprisey clutter from Eclipse without any of the powerful tools (the exception is the profiler, which is very good and the reason why I own a copy, but that only comes out for a day at the end of a game development cycle). I'd rather command line compile than use Flex Builder for day to day tasks.",1238849820

You can't pull more money than you already put in there.<p>Tipjoy could be compromised by phishing of either your Twitter or your Tipjoy password. This is equivalent to PayPal.<p>We allow a 3rd party to create a link to sign in a Tipjoy user, which requires a Twitter username & password, and eventually will work with OAuth:
<a href=""http://tipjoy.com/api/#create_login_link"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tipjoy.com/api/#create_login_link</a><p>This isn't a big deal considering you can just tweet a payment with those same credentials.

Its incredibly cheap to make an album now and autotune a good single. But labels can make or break an artist purely through marketing.<p>Most people rely on radio, music videos and reviews from big publications to find music. Its the same with magazines, review sites and events for gaming.<p>As long as one company can manufacture PR and buzz on a huge scale then the Blockbuster model will still exist. Most people simply don't put the effort in and casually buy what sounds popular - and that's completely reasonable.",1238849275

But doing so will make your web app look and behave like a 1998 dinosaur, and using a framework is just so much easier, more comfortable and less error-prone.<p>While frameworks add complexity as far as the computer is concerned, they remove complexity as far as the human developer is concerned. I can write a web app in Ruby on Rails much faster than I could ever have with mod_perl, and the result is better-looking and easier to maintain.",1238846707

Presumably they had it running internally for a while before they released it.<p>From this, we can see that when they built their own pretty much the only realistic open source option was ActiveMQ, which can hardly be described as a light-weight solution (not to mention it still doesn't have a stellar reputation under high loads). When the alternatives aren't rock solid yet, rolling your own (where at least you understand all of the code and how it works) seems like a perfectly practical alternative.",1238846576

Two guys standing in line at a concession at a crowded football stadium talking might have no strict expectation of privacy, but they might have an expectation of privacy from a particular audience (hypothetically, let's say their wives).  When you record their conversion, you are not violating their expectations of privacy, because many people could have heard that conversion.  However, were you to broadcast the recording, at that point you have violated the assumptions they thought the privacy was affording them.  Some of the hackers here would argue that they shouldn't speak in plain English, but should always speak to other humans in an encrypted spoken language and because they didn't do that they deserve no privacy for speaking in English.<p>I would disagree with those people.",1347361190

Unemployment stays a point or two higher than what everyone hoped, despite the fact that the opposition party has taken historically unprecedented steps (see <a href=""http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/12/breaking_the_filibuster_in_one.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/12/breaking...</a>) to unconditionally block any positive action the president might take, an unheard-of development that nobody anticipated.<p>Overall, if unemployment is your vector, the job creation records of George W Bush (""qualified"") vs. Obama (""unqualified"") could not be in more stark comparison: <a href=""http://www.pensitoreview.com/2010/10/11/obama-created-863k-jobs-in-2010-so-far-more-than-double-bushs-annual-average/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pensitoreview.com/2010/10/11/obama-created-863k-j...</a> (Obama Has Created 863K Jobs in 2010, More Than Double Average Annual Creation under Bush)<p>This is your evidence that Obama is ""unqualified"", yet George W.

The biggest mobile platform of the moment is Android, and it's completely focussed on Java (whether that's a good thing is a whole different discussion).<p>Without Android, I think Java-the-language would fade very quickly, because IMO you can't possible assert the language is better in any way, for any kind of purpose, compared to the many alternatives. It's archaic, verbose, unnecessarily restrictive, misses most of the more modern language features, or bolted them on like ugly warts, it is not a very good RAD language because you need so much boilerplate, etc. In my experience (I've written about 100k lines of Java, many multiples of that in C, C++, Delphi, Python, Objective-C and PHP), Java is without doubt the least pleasant language to write.<p>As for Java-the-platform, I think that part of Java will not go away quickly.

Large organizations have different aims from hackers.</i><p>This is where I think pg's bias steered him wrong.  Hackers tend not to like Java (although that is less the case now with the JVM ecosystem being what it is), but hackers do not solely determine the success of technology.  Furthermore, the type of hacker that pg is interested inthe lisper, the 10Xer, the startup founderare in limited supply.  Certainly they wield more influence per capita, but they still need critical mass to form a stable community around an open source platform in order to compete with large organizations.  If you're looking to build a product or a small scale project, by all means find yourself a Grade-A hacker.<p>If you want to make the next ubiquitous programming platform though, there are other qualities that are necessary.  Consensus building is probably the most important skill that large organizations have that hackers will struggle with at scale.  If you have a ton of management and mediocre programmers, it's easier to at least get them moving in the same direction, and they'll be more tolerant of the foibles of a designed-by-committee language.  Sun had the perfect storm of strong technical talent to design a solid language, but also the large organization effects to market a new platform to enterprise decision makers.<p>In a way I think pg's smell test might be more valid for an earlier era.  He underestimated the influence of the mediocre programming armies, probably because back in the old days there weren't as many and they weren't as mediocre.  This is just speculation on my part, but I have to imagine that the quality of the average programmer as declined over time as the numbers and appearance as a recognized career path have increased.  I mean how many people were programmers in the 70s because they're parents thought that's what they should go to school for?",1347358086

Even for these, the bottleneck is frequently somewhere else than the CPU.<p>I think my mother and sisters represent mainstream computing better than I do: The check mail, watch YouTube videos and look at pictures of the family. There's nothing there that requires more computing power than what tablets have today.<p>The Google Nexus 7 is $200. It has enough computing power for what most of my family uses computers for. It still has other limitations that may make it unsuitable as a wholesale PC replacement - say ports for plugging in a large monitor, options for printing, drivers for various USB devices - but those limitations do not primarily call for a faster CPU.<p>If you disagree, I'd be curious to know where you see a mass market for significantly more CPU power than what we expect from the natural evolution of ARM.",1358812786

5094553,comment,5092457,5092457,2,0,hello_newman,,,"Though not a ""start up"" in the sense of how we use the word now, I can think of a couple people who have started solo before as well:<p>1. Donald Trump: say what you want about him, but the man knows how to make money. I am sure his father helped him, but his first commercial building that launched him to wealth was done by himself.<p>2. Hugh Hefner: got tired of his job, and started the first ""gentlemans"" magazine.<p>3. Joe Coulombe: started a chain of grocery stores in the LA area. Later became Trader Joes.<p>4. Andrew Carnegie: one of the richest people who ever lived. He was helped by people certainly (traditional educations weren't as popular back then, but he started working in railroads young and was helped by his boss, Thomas Scott, who was the founder of The Pennsylvania Railroad Company) but he made his money by himself.<p>5. Howard Schultz: Went on a trip to Italy and fell in love with Italian coffee and the coffee shop atmosphere. So inpired by what he saw in Italy he came back and opened up a coffee shop which later turned into Starbucks.<p>6. Tony Hsieh: started his first company, Link Exchange, by himself. Once the company got going he brought in a college friend. Sold to Microsoft for 265MM, later founded Zappos.<p>7. Sara Blakely: mentioned in comments on the article, but she was frustrated by her panty hose that rode up her legs and wanted something to slim her in her favorite jeans (apparently a common girl problem). Took her 5k savings, started knocking on manufactures doors, hacked her way into a meeting with a Neiman Marcus buyer and became one of the few women billionaires.<p>8. Mark Hughes: from a disrupted childhood and born to a single mother who later passed and was later raised from grandparents, he got involved in the MLM business. After one of the companies he was working for went under, he started Herbalife.<p>I could go on and on, but the point I'm trying to make and what others seems to say, is if you think you can handle your shit and are passionate enough about your idea, go ahead and start a company by yourself. More equity for you, and once you get going you can always find other people to help you out.",1358812612

My counterpoint would be that if you create a specific account and post the thing you're trying to promote in the first 10 minutes, you haven't lurked enough.<p>Yes I know you can lurk without an account, but to reach the stage where that's considered acceptable you have to travel through if they felt they couldn't register an account for more than 5 minutes, if they felt they couldn't comment and plenty of other ifs, yet somehow they can create an account and post what they're promoting in 10 minutes, then only interact with people in their thread?<p>Young people should be encouraged.

5094538,comment,5094354,5094488,2,0,jey,,,"Agreed. Maybe make it so women don't even have to send the first message, and instead just click an ""I'm interested"" button, which then notifies the guy so he can send a message if he wants. This addresses several problems: if women are going to be screening/filtering anyway, might as well have them do it upfront and only get messages from people they are interested in (instead of being bombarded with crap), and men would be incentivized to write better messages instead of sending a high volume of low-quality crap. This is also in line with some (possibly bogus) social psychology research[1] that suggests that women are the ones who usually initiate courtship by signalling through non-verbal cues, even though the first ""overt"" move (like going up and starting a conversation) is usually by men.<p>On the other hand, there's a real question of whether women would be willing to put in the time/effort to view profiles and mark them as interesting or not interesting, but I bet that on current dating sites women do browse profiles pretty regularly but stop short of actually messaging people they're interested in.

As I did acknowledge, we looked into your services some time ago and things may have moved on, so perhaps for everyone's benefit you could clarify a few things that bugged us back then?<p>As far as VAT goes, at the time you appeared to collect it and then remit it directly to national tax authorities, not to your clients. If that is still the case, could you explain why you are required to collect VAT at all if you're acting as a reseller and based outside the EU? If you're acting as the merchant for tax/legal purposes, how do clients offset VAT they have paid themselves against VAT on the purchase if you handle all of the collection and remittance directly? If you're acting on behalf of the merchant, how do clients integrate with your systems so that any invoices generated on your side meet the requirements for sequential numbering if they also sell via other channels?<p>In terms of data protection, are you now covered by Safe Harbor or equivalent provisions, so there is no risk of clients running into trouble because you might be considered to be collecting personal data on their behalf and then exporting it outside the EEA?<p>Regarding the pricing, I'm afraid you just have to eat that one. Obviously you're offering a tailored service in exchange for the higher rates, so it's an apples to oranges comparison, but just about everyone from newcomers like Stripe and GoCardless to old school payment gateways now offers hosted options or transparent integrations that can be set up in hours, not ""months or even years of dev work"". Meanwhile, none of the options we've been considering recently are anywhere close to the rates you charge even with extreme adverse factors.

North Korea is well aware they cannot wage a war of aggression nor can they sustain a defensive posture. They've been aware of this for 40+ years and have had time to prepare. Their only effective military option is to make the cost of defeating them so prohibitively high that no nation will dare. To this end they've riddled the mountains near the DMZ with tunnels for logistic resupply and as firing positions. These tunnels admit the movement of men and material out of sight of overhead spy planes and, now, satellites. The DPKR easily has thousands of tunnels at its disposal.<p>It's entirely possible that the US and its allies have mapped the endpoints of these tunnels and _could_ simultaneously bombard them all, but if even 10% were missed Seoul could be absolutely decimated. (There are reports that South Korean and US special forces make incursions into the North to discover and map tunnels, so I'd be willing to bet that the percentage of unknowns is much higher than 10%.)<p>Interestingly, if Seoul and other populated areas were to be moved--that is, its 15 million citizens collectively abandoned the city and rebuilt, say, 100 miles away from the DMZ--this strategic advantage of the DPRK would be voided. Ignoring the staggering cost of this, it's probable that the North would view such action as provocation to war and act accordingly.<p>From the field of possible responses to North Korea it's entirely possible that waiting for it to burn itself out may well be the least costly tactic, measured by unnatural human deaths. That means, of course, that the DPRK's concentration camps and system of repression must be tolerated until such horrors lead to the destruction of the government from internal forces.

So, after Apple and MGWU, I would be left with 40% of all sales - something I don't think the publicity would offset, even long term.

5094290,comment,5088815,5091961,1,0,ramanujan,,,"First off, I am happy that we both seem to agree on a qualitative fact: there is indeed a tradeoff between what statisticians call type I and type II errors. At one extreme, you can let everything through, advance technology rapidly, and suffer some side effects (type I bias). Or you can block everything, stop technology, and suffer no side effects (type II bias). If we agree on this qualitative point, the key is whether we are currently at a Pareto optimum. Is our current system optimizing the type I vs. type II tradeoff? I have a numerical scenario below which you can critique, but first to your points.<p><pre><code>  It's faster to run experiments on animals than people. \n</code></pre>\nI'm not gainsaying the utility of animal models. I just think the goal needs to be to get to humans as soon as the safety data is in, <i>because</i> people are dying.<p><pre><code>  I think you are vastly overestimating what society has to \n  gain by deregulating medicine. You'll get a one-time gain \n  of 10 years of progress at the cost of an unknown number of \n  lives.\n</code></pre>\nWell, the reason sulfalinamide/thalidomide were heavily covered in 1938/1962 respectively was that those were relatively <i>rare</i> events. So I would somewhat disagree that the number of lives would be unknown. But, ok, let's take as a given that some would die. On the other side of the ledger, we both agree that tens of millions of people each year are dying from cancer and heart disease. So let's consider two scenarios for a cure for condition X, which kills 1 million people per year.<p>In scenario I, we do it status quo and safe, with no deaths. Very generously, let us grant that a cure appears in 10 years. This is generous because a regulated market may never iterate upon the cure if it is radical/different (e.g. Barry Marshall and H. pylori).<p>In scenario II, we accelerate the cure in a deregulated market. The R&D phase takes 1 year and costs us 100 deaths from test pilots / early adopters; the scaling phase takes 2 years and costs us another 900 deaths from volunteers. These numbers are vastly in excess of any reasonable safety testing paradigm  in a deregulated space (no one died in Banting & Best's experiments) and I cite them as extremely conservative upper bounds.<p>Ok. Then in scenario I, the status quo, you had<p><pre><code>  - 0 die from testing\n  - cure appears at end of 10 years\n  - 10 million people die over those 10 years\n  - 10 million deaths\n</code></pre>\nIn scenario II, you had<p><pre><code>  - 1000 die from testing over 3 years\n  - 3 million die from disease over those yeers\n  - cure appears in year 3\n  - no further deaths\n  - 3 million + 1000 total deaths\n</code></pre>\nSo scenario II saves ~7 million lives. Feel free to play with the numbers, but that's the kind of calculus I think we need to engage in, one that explicitly reckons with the cost of delay. In reality, the number of deaths attributable to R&D won't be close to 1000, though it won't be zero. But there is no reasonable scenario in which R&D actually consumes anything close to as many lives as the disease itself.",1358809419

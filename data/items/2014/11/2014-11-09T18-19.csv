When those thoughts are worthwhile and clearly expressed, you yield a result not unlike tokenadult&#x27;s.<p>Now, he has actually iterated upon that post and did not write it from scratch, which I can tell because I recognize his writing style, and he posted a very similar comment sans the phonemics and phonetics on some of HN thread 2 years back on learning languages[1].<p>You&#x27;ll notice trends in the structure, as he moves from his relevant story, rounds around some inline-defined concepts, and finally closes with a summarized forward outlook and pitfalls to avoid. As I said, it also helps that he already had the general idea behind this organized, combined with his experience in the area of learning a Sinnitic language.<p>And don&#x27;t believe we&#x27;re so high and mighty, if tempted. We make mistakes all the time, and as I pointed above, you may not have realized that tokenadult had an outline for this already in his head. You also may not realize that he made a mistake - the consonant cluster differentiating &#x27;speak&#x27; and &#x27;speaks&#x27; is not grammatical (i.e., describing relations between words) but, rather, lexical (i.e., referring to different ideas). This is an incredibly minor terminology kludge. Yet how often can that happen, escaping your notice, on a comment on L2 caching? On the exact algorithmic analysis of a bloom filter? On vague theoretical concepts such as referential transparency? Ad infinitum.<p>Don&#x27;t overthink it too much (if you get me), just write as you did above. That is precisely how you will, eventually get to tokenadult&#x27;s level.<p>As Alan Perlis: &quot;What you know about computing other people will learn. What&#x27;s in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.&quot;<p>What others know of X you will learn, because what&#x27;s in your hands is intelligence and openness.<p>Peace in your journey.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4714388"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4714388</a>",1415559543

Of the S&P500. So no, you&#x27;re not saying &quot;they&#x27;re both stupid&quot;. You&#x27;re saying &quot;buy an index fund&quot; and I&#x27;m saying, there are more sophisticated ways of doing exactly what you&#x27;re advocating.<p>And I&#x27;ll answer your questions: 
1. I don&#x27;t have to &quot;beat&quot; professionals. When you sell options, you&#x27;re selling at the Bid price. The market makers are still making their few-pennies cut, because that&#x27;s how their business works.<p>2. Option pricing is transparent. One of the multiplicands in options pricing formulas is Implied Volatility. This is a forward looking, crowdsourced guess of where the market thinks volatility is headed. It&#x27;s not backward looking, that&#x27;s Historical Volatility. The thing about IV is that empirically, it over-estimates. Since the CBOE first invented the Call option 20 or 30 years ago, actual volatility has been lower than the Implied Volatility predicted. And that&#x27;s the edge dufer, it&#x27;s an arbitrage opportunity between IV and actual volatility. There is of course no guarantee it will always be there, but it always has been, and that counts for something.<p>Another way to look at this is simple: People buy options for a variety of reasons. Speculation and Hedging primarily. The options market has to build-in an edge for option sellers, otherwise nobody would sell them.<p>Alright, I&#x27;m sorry if ever my emotions ran a little high. I love HN but the tendency to shout-down what you don&#x27;t agree with sickens me a little and I have a hard time just yielding to it.",1415559445

Thousand foot high waves don&#x27;t move across 2ft deep water without breaking.  Also, lame camera tricks prevent the astronauts from simply scanning 360d and realizing there&#x27;s a huge wave bearing down on them.  Also, there was no reason whatsoever for Doyle to die on the water planet.<p>2.  Too emo.  Too much bawling and crying, too much emotional decision making, the actors weren&#x27;t convincing as trained scientists or disciplined test pilots.  The audience actually burst out <i>laughing</i> when Mann and Cooper got into the fight on the ice planet, and when Cooper just let Mann bash his helmet in a couple times instead of pulling away like normal person would.  See <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> and <i>The Right Stuff</i> for how such people should be portrayed.  Artistic integrity sacrificed for artful, faux emotional appeal, SOP for Hollywood these days.<p>3.  When Mann crashed the shuttle into the mothership, then Cooper and Brand saved the mothership, one second it was over a planet, and not the first planet they visited that was really close to the black hole but the next one out.  The next instant they were in danger of falling into the black hole.  Months or years worth of distance traversed in seconds.<p>4.  Cooper saved Brand by dropping both TARS and himself into the black hole, giving Brand on the mothership enough velocity/lack of mass/whatever to escape the black hole.  The time dilation effects of him dropping into the black hole should have meant he and Brand diverged greatly in age, yet the end of the movie showed him taking off to go find her, same age.<p>5.  The premise of the movie is that future, advanced, five-dimensional humanity was using its power over gravity, time, and higher dimensions to help humanity of the past survive the dying and &#x27;Marsification&#x27; of the earth.  But the paradox was never resolved - if humanity of the past couldn&#x27;t survive on its own, how did it ever become humanity of the future?  I suppose they did that on purpose to let the audience have fun debating it afterwards.<p>There were a few others I can&#x27;t remember atm, but you get the gist.  Some of these, like #3, I suppose have to be done to cram the whole story into a 2hr45m movie (another cool thing about it - nice and long), but others were just annoyingly pointless.<p>But again, overall it was good, worth watching, and having Kip Thorne co-produce helped a lot.

8580443,comment,8579940,8579940,0,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Nice article. I love databases too for similar reasons but, as someone that designs database engines, some of the technical points are off the mark. I never really stop learning in this area, the technical range is incredibly deep and nuanced.<p>Some of the points that caught my eye as being quite off:<p>- Contrary to footnote 2, modern database designs bypass the OS file system cache and schedule their own I/O. This has an enormous performance impact versus the OS cache (2-3x is pretty typical) and is a good litmus test for the technical sophistication of the database implementation. It is the primary reason many open source database engines, even &quot;write-oriented&quot; ones, have relatively poor write performance to disk.<p>- The three data retrieval models enumerated are textbook but if you were designing a new engine today you probably would not use any of them for a general purpose design. Modern spatial access methods (ex: Hyperdex, SpaceCurve, Laminar) are superior in almost every way though the literature is much sparser. Also, a number of real-time analytical databases use bitmap-structured databases (ex: ParStream), which are incredibly fast for some types of query workloads.<p>- Many distributed database challenges are a side effect of &quot;one server, one shard&quot; type models. It is not necessary to do things this way, it is just simpler to implement; some distributed database systems have thousands of shards per server. The latter model is operationally more robust and better behaved under failure and load skew.<p>- Tombstones are usually trivial if the database engine is properly designed. Complications are a side effect of poor architecture. The big challenge for tombstones is deciding when and how tombstoned records are garbage collected. It is outside the scope of the normal execution pathways but you also don&#x27;t want a Java-like GC thread in the background.<p>Of course, any of these is a long blog post in itself. :-)",1415557603

So if ~zod is down, and everyone depends on ~zod, the network is indeed hosed.  Everyone with active links can continue talking to each other, but nobody new can find anyone, and nobody can find anyone new.  Every ship depends on a carrier for routing.<p>By convention, every time you launch from your pier, you get a new random port number and any ship that was looking for you at your old address needs to hear about your new address from a higher-up ship.<p>So it is distributed, but finitely distributed.  There are only 256 carriers allowed, and they are the only ships that are really independent.  Though there has been talk about fleshing out how ships can be separable from their &quot;sein&quot; domain, or parent ships, currently almost everyone is from the same lineage and thus depends on the same pair of servers for pretty much everything regarding the network.<p>This &quot;centralized&quot; design is indeed a core feature of the network, and it even relies on DNS to be bootstrapped, another centralized system.

</code></pre>
this is a simple app to keep spec writers (product managers and designers for apps currently) stay sharp through a fun  spec&#x27;ing exercise.<p>you are shown a random dribbble image. 
you have 1 minute* to give:<p><pre><code>  - a 3 word description
  - a 1 liner
  - a 1 para description
  - tags and a name for a hypothetical spec.
</code></pre>
it currently has 500 designs. and it takes me just a one-liner to add many more.<p>( PS: is 1 minute too much, too less ? )<p>once i have enough data, i think i&#x27;ll be able to build an inverted index.
ie: given a design pattern or tag => show me similiar designs or &quot;specs&quot;.<p>i was helping a friend of mine train to think like a product manager.<p>so i built an mvp this weekend
http://specthis.parseapp.com<p>flashcards for GRE/GMAT/TOEFL are well known, but even a google search for specs show practically nothing. mind games for product managers/designers/spec writers are unheard of. perhaps this could even become a github for specs. i have a few 6-7 letter domain names i&#x27;ve soft circled as well.<p>PS: a major reason for posting here is that i am looking for a designer to collaborate with. if you like the idea, help spread the word.",1415556701

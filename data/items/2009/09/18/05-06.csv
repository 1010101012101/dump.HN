OK, I paid my rent and got paid, here's $11, thanks a lot. That's what liquidity is, and it's important - with your suggestion everything would become glacially slow and tiny credit hiccups would become hugely amplified. You should be able to buy when you see an opportunity and sell when you need cash, even if your need of cash is to finance another buy.<p>The problem with flash trading is that its practitioners are in effect paying the exchanges for the right to join in on a trade after it's been proposed and they can see whether it has profit potential or not. Sure, they are making tiny margins of a fraction of 1%, so they say it's not greedy. Good point. But you can only afford to do that if you've got fat money to participate and to make up for those tiny margins they're putting up big money on every deal that does show profit potential.<p>I find it hard to believe it's been legal up to now. Every time I study it, I'm reminded of some old movie where a gangster has paid out money for a private telegraph line to get the results of the horse race while the betting is still open at a remote location.<p>I think the long-term quantities you propose like 6 months and 2 years are absurd, but I agree with your basic premise that too much speed trading undermines the market's price discovery function and evaluates arbitrage over considerations of fundamental value.

Specifically:<p>Avoid all foods with hydrogenated oils (promotes heart disease.)<p>Avoid homogenized milk (promotes blood vessel plaque, heart disease.)<p>Eliminate excess sugar and high fructose corn syrup. Substitute with agave nectar which is just as yummy and very low glycemic.  (promotes diabetes and creates inconsistent blood glucose levels which promote obesity.)<p>Avoid refined carbohydrates, substituting whole grains, vegetables, sweet potatoes, nuts, legumes, berries, greens, etc.  Substitute wheat for quinoa and teff. Substitute white rice for brown rice.  (Refined carbs deplete B vitamins and promote glucose instability.)<p>Avoid all meat packed with sodium nitrate (promotes colon cancer).  Look for ""uncured"" meats.<p>Avoid artificial sugars, flavors, colors. (Nearly all of them have unfortunate side effects.)<p>Try to get 90% of your protein from plant sources.

It would have to be so safe to humans that you could mix powders of it in your drinking water, in quantities sufficient to create iced tea, without any ill effects.  It would have to be simple enough that an illiterate peasant could deploy it using technology routinely available in the early 1900s.  It would have to be dirt cheap enough to spray into every home in an at-risk region in Africa.  It would have to be patent unencumbered, so that anyone could produce it.  It would have to be stupidly easy to synthesize in quantity.  It would have to have decades of research put into finding a fumigation protocol to defeat those crafty mosquito's pesky tendency to develop immunities.  And it would have to be guaranteed to work, for example, by being successfully used to totally eliminate malaria in every continent inhabited primarily by white people.<p>If only such a magic chemical existed, we wouldn't have to waste time thinking up ways to swat mosquitoes singly with radar-guided laser weaponry.  We'd just hire a bunch of folks to go around and spray a bit inside of dwellings, and bam, malaria cases would decrease by 90% within the first season of treatment, saving thousands of lives and removing an enormous economic loadstone from Africa's collective neck.<p>I know, I know, it sounds like a sucky sci-fi book because if the chemical is so perfect then where is the conflict?

829688,comment,829488,829488,0,0,justin_vanw,,,"Simply force purchasers to hold stock for at least 6 months, or some other long period, so that fundamentals will have to be carefully looked at.  Buying a stock signals confidence in a companies stock price for the duration you expect to hold the stock.  If you make people hold it longer, the signal becomes more meaningful.  Finally, market manipulation becomes much less rewarding, since you can only flip your money twice a year (profit from manipulation is % gained each time * capital * number of manipulations), and you can't foment at all really.<p>Perhaps it would also be helpful to put a 5 (or more) day delay on any sell orders.  I would personally be in favor of a 2 year delay or more.  Currently, if you get really bad news (like a companies only drug was not approved, making the company worthless) you can sell the stock immediately via a market sell order, and get whatever the highest offer is.  This is no different than collecting pre-signed contracts to buy your house, then signing the best one when you see smoke coming out of the windows.  The person offering to buy the stock has obviously not had time to adjust their order based on the news, and so you are selling them something they weren't bidding on.  If you give buyers time to adjust, selling on a panic would be completely retarded, since you will either lose all value (selling into a market with buyers who have adjusted their offers way down), or the panic will subside and you will get a fine price, but then could have just held it as you were planning before the panic anyway.  Discouraging panic selling makes prices more stable (does anyone honestly think that the best estimate of the value of a large company could possibly vary 50% in a few days??)  Also, automated trading triggers would be eliminated, which would be great.  If a firm can setup computers to sell a stock if it drops 5% in 1 minute, then they are taking much less risk than someone who has to hear news, find a computer, put in login information, etc.  However, the firm's buy order signals the same confidence as the careful stock researcher, while in reality they can buy stock with far less confidence since they are taking less risk.<p>Both of these measures would reduce market volatility, if not effectively eliminate it over short periods.  This would mean that corporations could borrow money on much better terms, since their stock prices would be more stable, meaning that stock is better collateral.  It would also mean shareholders would insist on things like dividends and long term profitability and planning, since they are going to be holding the bags if things aren't good in the long term.",1253250059

GDocs seem a bit more peppy.<p>I was reading a Paul Graham interview from a while ago:\n<a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/02/an-interview-with-vc-paul-graham-of-ycombinator/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/02/an-interview-with-vc-pa...</a><p>Here is an interesting quote:\n""\nI wouldn't advise competing with Google in things they're good at. So what is Google good at? As a first approximation, making things their own developers use at work. So they'll do a better job on an online calendar than a video sharing site, for example, because their employees are probably not supposed to be sitting watching videos at work.\n""<p>He goes on to mention Google's size, which is probably another factor here.<p>It would be interesting to hear more about what folks at Y-Combinator think about this direct assault on a growing Google service.",1184192758

Surely 4% is good. And how are these rates going to change with metrics better than unique page views?",1184191775

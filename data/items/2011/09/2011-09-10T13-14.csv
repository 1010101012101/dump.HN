2981567,comment,2981442,2981519,14,0,glenra,,,"Suppose you use the same freeway set for exactly two films:
(1) the big expensive sequel _Matrix Reloaded_
(2) some cheap indie zombie film (being on an <i>entirely empty freeway</i> in the middle of the day is kind of creepy all by itself)
...and then the set has to be destroyed - a storm knocks it down or the land owners decide they want the space back for some other use.<p>One rational accounting method would be to split the cost evenly between films (or perhaps you could divide it based on how many hours/days of filming was done in that location.) But film #1 (a) made a profit, (b) owes percentages of the profit to people who made the first film. Film #2 lost money and was made by people with less negotiating power than Keanu Reeves, so having it lose <i>more</i> money doesn't benefit the studio. Given this simple case, you'd want to allocate as much of the expense as possible to the first film, leading to court battles over exactly how the cost should be allocated. Was this set used for <i>more hours</i> for film #1? Was it <i>more crucial to the plot</i> for that film?<p>And okay, that might still be manageable. But what doesn't work is to leave the number of films to be shot there <i>open-ended</i>. If the freeway set stays up, the lawyers representing Keanu Reeves can reasonably argue that you <i>intend</i> to make <i>one hundred</i> films there, so the _Matrix Reloaded_ production should only get dinged for 1% of the cost rather than all of it or half of it.",1315662740

2981547,comment,2981393,2981509,10,0,zhoutong,,,"I'm actually quite serious about security. But I still feel that the security-related discussions are too overwhelming. Of course I know that nothing is 100% secure, but I can make my bottom-line high.<p>This is not my first project. I have been coding in Rails for almost 3 years, with some failed projects. I also know some security basics because I have hacked websites before (non-destructive).<p>There is always relative security. Ruby on Rails itself is a relatively secure framework. Rails sites have been much less frequently hacked than PHP sites. (Because everything is well wrapped.) I'm also very conservative about using Rails (rarely override methods myself, not even toughing find_by_sql even when it's the easy way).<p>Passwords are stored hashed and salted using BCrypt. Although no explicit security auditing has been done, all the Rails app logs (including requests and IP addresses) are extracted and backed up nightly. Soft-deleting is enabled for all operations, etc.<p>I'm not distracting myself from the real problem, but I have to say that I'm not that kind of random kids who write crappy apps for fun.<p>My use of Heroku is also partly because of security. I use Mac and know a bit of Linux, but I know I can't really set up a Linux box and be sure about the security. Instead I have chosen Heroku's integrated, read-only and cloud-based platform.<p>Sorry for not replying most of the security-related comments. Not because I can't face opposing arguments, but instead, I think they are valuable.<p>However, I hope everyone can be a little bit more reasonable and realistic. Since nothing is secure, security is everyone's problem. Although I don't have anything to prove my security experience, at least this is not the first time I deal with money. I once developed a mini payment gateway (PayPal and credit card) for my friend who used it to process transactions totaling more than $50,000. There're a lot of fraudulent orders, which means that people have an incentive to steal, but the payment system itself has been safe.<p>I can understand that people are skeptical considering my age (or even my Chinese name). But will the Bitcoin community be better off if I shut down the project now? I have chosen Bitcoin because its low barrier to entry and open community, not because I have no bottom-line or security concerns.<p>What I really want to disagree is the view that I must end this project now. There are basically too many people emailing me just to thank me for delivering the features that the big guys (Mt. Gox and TradeHill) can't finish in months.<p>I have taken the extreme minimalistic approach in development of Bitcoinica - no Bitcoin wallets and no unusable features. I make it a pure trading platform - you can't even do money laundering on Bitcoinica. System wise, I don't have to SSH the server to configure anything, and I don't have to even see the database credentials myself.<p>Anyway, I completely accept all the negative viewpoints about Bitcoinica, but I just want to explain clearly that I may not be the person everyone's thinking about.",1315661910

Is Bitcoinica's interface considered hypertext-driven?</i><p>It means that the docs should only have to document a single URI (the entrypoint) and the formats, which should have links to the various parts of the API.<p>For example, you could have an URI, say 'bitcoinica.com/api'. Then you GET that, and it returns a JSON file with the following key/value:<p><pre><code>     ""ticker"": ""http://bitcoinica.com/api/ticker""
</code></pre>
Now the client knows how to get to the Ticker. Then you GET that, and you receive a new list:<p><pre><code>    { ""btc-dlr"" : ""http://.../api/ticker/btc-dlr"", ""btc-eur"": ""http://.../apu/ticker/btc-eur"", ...
</code></pre>
Now the client knows how to request a certain currency pair.<p>This means the URLs can change without breaking all the existing clients.<p>In general, I'd say this is ""kind-of"" RESTful. It doesn't follow HATEOAS and it uses custom formats (it's inevitable, since there's no standard for this). Having URLs for each concept and reusing HTTP methods and auth is RESTful, though.<p> Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State
 JSON and XML aren't really formats, they're more like transport mechanisms. Formats are KML, MathML, atom, etc.
The point is that knowing it's XML or JSON tells you nothing, your clients are still completely tied to their API. It's just nice not having to write a parser, but it's not a standard format.",1315660615

Tricky Hollywood Accounting"" - this is purely a contract negotiation issue, and it is is no way a hollywood-specific problem - in all lines of businesses you will find companies which try to setup ""royalty fee"" or similar buyer-controlled expenses to dry up profit to ensure as little is paid out as possible to the seller. A good negotiation team will prevent this, both in Hollywood and elsewhere.<p>""5. Extorting Theaters"" - this is bullshit for 95% of theatres. The large movie theatre chains in North America have leverage over the studios, as while there is a large number of movies available at any given time, there are only a relatively small (fixed) number of theatre screens. The price and revenue split of a film in a theatre is based on supply and demand; movie theatres do not cut the exact same deal with studios for every single film, instead they negotiate based on the expected results of the film. In the cases where movie theatres don't think the film will do well, the studios basically get screwed into subsidizing the movie theatre to show the film. In cases where the movie is expected to do very well, the theatres end up giving up more for the right to have it on their screen. I'm sure small independent theatres are a different story, but in all businesses small players have less negotiation power, and therefore get worse deals.<p>""4. Fake Reviews"" - this is just the work of dishonest marketers - I don't understand how it is a reason to justify disrupting the movie business.<p>""3. Copyright Bullshit"" - this is a US specific problem, not a film business wide problem, as copyright laws change by country. It could also be viewed as a good thing for producers in the film business, as they can profit off their films longer.<p>""2. Strangling Consumer choice"" - again, its a contract issue and has much in common with 6, Extorting Theaters, and the resulting supply and demand struggle. Theaters don't want to pay as high a price for a film if its available in other channels, as that means attendance/viewership will be lower. Same with TV stations, Pay-per-view, and so on. Therefore, if studios want to be able to actually pay for the film they produced, they have to be very careful as to where and in what order they show their content.<p>""1. Stealing Scripts"" - This is just not a film business problem. People steal ideas everywhere, all the time.

I drove on it (as an extra in the movie); it was really really cool. The company originally thought of keeping this set around for a while to use in driving scenes for other film projects, but they ended up destroying it instead. Why? Because the film was likely to be profitable! A film set that's only used for <i>one</i> movie and then destroyed can obviously be deducted (as a necessary expense) from the profits of that movie, whereas a film set that's reused for several films can't. So this ""tricky accounting"" can have the effect of artificially inflating production costs (as well as distribution costs).",1315660024

It was a build system job vs. graphics job (I have a grad degree and the equivalent of a few years of work experience), but they had primed me for something specific. Questions like ""how do you feel about regularly working until midnight and hounding people you have no authority over who break the build?"" did not help.<p>I assume that they were mostly incompetent rather than evil, but it doesn't matter from the perspective of a company attracting talent.<p>Many people looking to hire are clueless of this and cannot explain why they have trouble hiring (a guy once simultaneously complained to me that he couldn't find competent programmers and complained that I wouldn't do small, sporadic 3D geometry jobs for $50/hr). I have noticed a common smugness amongst people hiring (despite the fact that many quickly reveal themselves to be of less than stellar technical ability). This is probably a bad attitude in a market where the best talent can quickly get multiple job offers and where not every person hiring is a jerk.<p>Part of the problem seems to be that many companies get by on hiring cheap workers. In particular they take advantage of students just out of school. That doesn't work very well because it is hard to retain those people, but it appears to be enough to keep many companies afloat.",1325887193

3435226,comment,3434399,3434844,5,0,mkn,,,"This is a hi-fidelity recapitulation of one of the main pop theories of negotiation, that good bargaining is always hard bargaining, especially if it's brainless. However, I think it's completely wrongheaded.<p>There's a great book called <i>Getting To Yes</i> that I recommend everybody read. Here are the main points in a nutshell:<p>1. Focus on interests, not positions.
2. Separate the people from the problem.
3. Invent options for mutual gain.
4. Insist on objective criteria.<p>How might that work in a salary negotiation? On the first point, the employer has interests in retention and morale, as well as in the value they can extract from an employee. (Or, maybe not. This is good information to have.) They want to minimize disruption so that they don't have to retrain. The employee has this interest, too, as it's stressful to change jobs. Neither party is going to be served by a wage that is out of balance either way.<p>On the second point, one important thing <i>not</i> to do is to treat them as someone whom you'd use petty tactics on, as someone to whom you would use something ""towards your advantage as bait."" You're always having a meta-negotiation about the terms of the negotiation that carries over into your employment environment. Are you going to be cutting each other's throat all the time? Or, during your working relationship, are you going to want to be reaching understandings about how best and most fairly to proceed?<p>On the third point, you might find that there is a non-obvious imbalance between your demonstrated skills, for example, and your potential in a job that looks to be an amazing fit. What to do then? Do we shift the risk onto the employer, forcing them to pay for potential? Do we shift it onto the employee, insisting on pay for experience only? Well, to ""invent an option,"" what about a probationary period long enough to see whether the potential is going to materialize? The pay would be, say, slightly above pay for experience only, but well below potential. And then you revisit, agreeing in advance that either party can walk if the fit is poor. That's one option, there may be more. Like contracting at a higher rate with an option to be brought on as an employee. Or so on.<p>Finally, on objective criteria: ""Market rate"" is not the only criteria. Market rate is just an average, anyhow. What's more objective would be anticipated value from the unique relationship between <i>this</i> employee and <i>that</i> company. How much can you increase sales? What's the likely perceived differential in reputation of your employer if you, the crack tester, continually find nasty bugs before they're discovered outside, so that they can be patched before they become problems? What if you're the amazing architect who can design a robust system that is easy to program in, increasing developer productivity across the board? These things are measurable, even if Bayesian, criteria, if we can look at your history of providing these goods.<p>I just bristle at this simplistic view of bargaining as mere power plays, and marvel at its persistence in the face of so many better options, not to mention the enormity of value left on the table by both sides of negotiations everywhere.",1325887010

If you have trouble staying afloat, or moving forward, swimming harder will just tire you out and make you sink more - you need to swim smarter and with better technique. Swimming is really quite effortless if you've got decent technique.

He could only find one place in London that offers an adults course.""<p>I work in Adult Education in the UK, and I also teach in a local Further Education College. You won't find an AS/A2 level course in Maths or any of the Sciences easily now. Its because of 'data driven management', which brings this post back on topic for this forum...<p>The short version: AS/A2 Maths and Science subjects are specialised and difficult. Evening class students have work and family commitments. They start a course with great enthusiasm, then, usually just after the New Year, reality kicks in with the cold weather and the difficulty of finding time to study. People drop out of the course. Those who have the time and self-organisation to make it to the exams usually pass, although grades are not astounding.<p>Data: when you attend a course in a Skills Funding Agency funded programme, your attendance is monitored and used to compile something called an ISR. Your attendance and the outcome of your exams are on the database.<p>Success: The percentage of the students who started left at the end is called 'retention'. The percentage of students who took the exam who pass is called 'achievement'. Success = retention * achievement.<p>""Raising Standards"": Success rates are compared with national benchmarks. Courses with pass rates that are more than 5% below benchmark are 'poor quality'. Single course percentages are aggregated (in wonderful ways) to give success figures for departments. Departments have success targets. Easiest way to improve your success? Dump the low performing courses. They happen to be the <i>harder subjects</i>.<p>There is a small industry in specialised data mining and tracking software that will process the database and 'pull out' the success statistics. Most of the applications look like they are written in VB or something similar, but some have Web interfaces. Middle managers in colleges in the UK spend an awful lot of time going through the database reports.<p>So now you know! Next time a politician speaks about 'raising standards in education' be aware that the <i>only way</i> you get fast change in the pass rates is by simply removing the lower scores by closing the courses.",1325885204

There are the other benefits, the work environment, what will I learn, what challenges will I have to overcome, will I enjoy the work.

You may take at a job that's a in a startup or at a company with financial difficulties that you think you can help turn around. In these scenarios a pay cut, deferred pay via bonus schemes or stock options maybe more important. Another issue is job security. Nobody likes to think of themselves as replaceable or average, but of course by definition most of us are.

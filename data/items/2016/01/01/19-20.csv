All of this was buried in the small-print of course: “the core technology behind the GoPro CineForm Codec has been standardized [sic]”. So in reality existing files were not decodable by a VC-5 decoder.<p>This is why open source is often so much better than open standards (though the latter the was used to help create the former, in this case).<p>Huge kudos to the author for doing this work, as well as explaining the process.",1451678361

That&#x27;s what you should be seeing as the result of letting a browser do content-negotiation directly with a RESTful API server.<p>CSS is likely to be too limited for that; often the layout you want to have means the DOM elements need to ordered and nested in ways that don&#x27;t actually make sense for your data.  What I&#x27;ve seen actually working was XSLT stylesheets.  Of course, that has its own issues with bloat, and forces XML for data transmission.

Most resources were mainly for 32-bit and there was hardly any documentation about Rust OS development. One day I decided to do a clean rewrite of my experimental rust kernel and had to look up all the required information again (since I had forgotten the details). So I decided to create the missing documentation myself and write some tutorials about booting a Rust kernel.<p>I wrote the first posts over the summer and it was kind of fun. I never wrote a blog post before and English is not my native language, so it was pretty challenging. I spent a lot of time rewriting and improving them until I was more or less satisfied. Eventually I had the guts to post it in the rust subreddit. I never expected that it would be useful for many people (who would want to write an OS in Rust?), but it totally took off. Someone posted it on hacker news and it even was the top post for a short time. I was completely stunned :D.<p>I really love writing these posts. It takes much time but it&#x27;s a great way to <i>really</i> understand the code since you need to explain every detail. It also helps to make the code as simple and straightforward as possible.<p>I still don&#x27;t know where this will lead. But I will keep on writing as long as people want to read it :). For the short term the plan is to explore interrupts and to add keyboard support. After that, I&#x27;m open to new ideas :).",1451678035

Which forces us into odd semantics of order in places where order usually does not matter. While at the same time throwing away any semantics of naming, usually much more important.<p>Besides the usability issue of introducing the wrong order as noted by the article, it also makes a mess of things like partial application and composition. Consider a language like Haskell where this is a fundamental part how you design function signatures. There is a function for swapping argument order just to make this work. [1]<p>Had the semantics of the language instead considers binding names more important than ordering there would be no need for that. A -> B -> C would already equal B -> A -> C. In fact you could throw away things like curry and uncurry too if you treated tuples as records, {A,B} -> C would also equal A -> B -> C<p>Of course now binding names would be much more important than ordering, so something like a rename function would probably still be needed.

10823021,comment,10821879,10821879,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"I agree that semantics are usually more important than syntax in a programming language, but surely syntax can still make a huge difference to both productivity and reliability. Let’s consider a simple example: taking a sequence of integers, and printing out those which are less than 5.<p>Here is how we might do that in Python, a language well known for its clean and simple syntax:<p><pre><code>    xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n    ys = filter(lambda x: x < 5, xs)\n    for y in ys:\n        print y\n</code></pre>\nThat seems pretty straightforward to me, though the lambda expression is a little clumsy compared to a language like Haskell that specialises in combining functions neatly:<p><pre><code>    main :: IO ()\n    main = do\n        let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n        let ys = filter (<5) xs\n        sequence_ $ map (putStrLn . show) ys\n</code></pre>\nThe output step in Haskell is a little awkward, as we have to be explicit about sequencing the effects, but this is more of a semantic issue than a syntactic one.<p>Now, let’s look at a C++ version. The C++ standard library has provided built-in filtering algorithms ever since its first standard back in the ’90s, but the syntax if you tried to actually use them was so bad that it took me about 15 minutes to even get this example to work:<p><pre><code>    #include <algorithm>\n    #include <functional>\n    #include <iterator>\n    #include <vector>\n    #include <iostream>\n    \n    #define ARRAY_LENGTH(x) (sizeof(x) / sizeof(*x))\n    \n    int main()\n    {\n        const int xs[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};\n        std::vector<int> ys;\n        std::remove_copy_if(xs, xs + ARRAY_LENGTH(xs),\n            std::back_inserter(ys),\n            std::not1(std::bind2nd(std::less<int>(), 5)));\n        std::copy(ys.begin(), ys.end(), std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, &quot;\n&quot;));\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis was an attempt to show a like-for-like comparison, though it’s a little unfair because it also shows the semantic problem of distinguishing between built-in arrays and the vector container, and it needs a lot of explicit headers where Python and Haskell both happen to make their filter algorithms available as standard. Still, just look at that remove_copy_if mess. Unsurprisingly, approximately no-one ever actually wrote C++ like this for real.<p>We could tidy that up with a few of the more recent improvements, but C++ is still hopelessly clumsy when it comes to employing standard library algorithms:<p><pre><code>    #include <algorithm>\n    #include <iterator>\n    #include <vector>\n    #include <iostream>\n    \n    int main()\n    {\n        const std::vector<int> xs = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};\n        std::vector<int> ys;\n        std::copy_if(xs.begin(), xs.end(),\n            std::back_inserter(ys),\n            [](int x){ return x < 5; });\n        std::copy(ys.begin(), ys.end(), std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, &quot;\n&quot;));\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIn reality, I suspect many C++ programmers are still just going to write C-style for loops instead for simple tasks like these, and who could blame them? The syntax for the other tools is so bad that programmers will avoid using them, even though the underlying semantics of that copy_if are no different to the clean one-liners in Python and Haskell.",1451677098

If you know a software engineer who fits, please direct them to jobs@phylagen.com.<p>We are an energized team developing microbiome data analytic tools and bioinformatics pipelines that are being applied to a wide range of environments. We plan to bring on an innovative coder - with a B.S. or M.S in computer science, engineering, statistics, or bioinformatics (translating to 4-5 years software engineering experience). We want someone deeply knowledgeable in algorithm optimization, including parallelization, distributed execution and implementing methods. The position will entail combining code and data from different disciplines, translating and optimizing published research algorithms (e.g. created in R/Python/Julia) into industry products, and creating reference databases that can be used in machine learning applications. Expertise in the analysis of metagenomics data and bioinformatics pipelines is a bonus. We are looking someone who is flexible - a fast learner with relevant experience that will allow them to contribute quickly. You will be a key player in a cutting edge, rapidly growing venture-backed microbiome startup.<p>Phylagen harnesses the vast, unseen world of microbes to improve our daily lives. The microbiome - the trillions of interacting bacteria, fungi, algae and viruses that inhabit every inch of our world - is the most complex, untapped dataset on earth. We combine advanced DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analytics with scalable, high performance computing to analyze the microbiome in ways previously not possible. This enables us to determine and interpret complex genetic signatures and provide a powerful new decision-making tool for businesses.",1451676958

Worse, it will work fine in testing and small workloads, but quickly you run out of threads in your execution context and find yourself with a broken production system.<p>Erlang differs for two main reasons. First, BEAM has a scheduler that will prevent blocked processes from tying up OS threads. So even if a library only supports synchronous calls, it will still work without interfering with other parts of your application. Second, everything is culturally designed around OTP (the standard library for concurrent applications). Libraries tend to support async modes in ways that jive well with the rest of your codebase. There aren&#x27;t really competing standards like Akka vs Finagle in Scala. Again, even if the code does not support async it will still work. Async is just an optimization (not just for performance, but the wide swath of runtime inspection tools work better on async designs).",1451676497

It tends to break down if you&#x27;re editing code and have a temporary intermediate stage that&#x27;s syntactically invalid.  It&#x27;s also not great in the face of copy-pasting, especially if you&#x27;re rearranging code in ways that breaks blocks.  You&#x27;re easily left with code that&#x27;s been &quot;autocorrected&quot; resulting in everything after a certain point being indented one level too much or too little.  In a brace-using language that would correspond to an extra closing brace (or a missing closing brace), and it&#x27;s easy to fix.  In an indent language, fixing it is more of a hassle.<p>Also if you have unmatched braces, that&#x27;s generally a trivial parse error - the compiler (or linter) will check that and find that every time.  But with indents, if the outcome of some code refactoring accidentally broke the indent and everything after some point is over-indented, that tends to superficially work (I&#x27;ve actually made that mistake several times in coffeescript).<p>Additionally, diffing tools I know of can be set to ignore whitespace, which makes common code changes much easier to understand.  If, on the other hand, you do that with an indent-sensitive language you&#x27;re going to miss indent-changes entirely.  That&#x27;s just a practical tooling problem - you <i>could</i> write a diff that works just as well for indent-based languages - but it&#x27;s a practical problem nonetheless.<p>All in all, I think it&#x27;s a much better idea to have braces.  If you think they&#x27;re ugly, use your syntax highlighter to deemphasize them.  A smart code editor could even omit the braces entirely in normal, syntactically valid code (which I&#x27;m not suggesting is necessarily a good idea, but it&#x27;s <i>possible</i>).",1451675362

Many emails are delivered out-of-order or not delivered at all, the sender&#x27;s email is not set in the from field, so you cannot glance at your inbox and see who replied to a thread and so many other issues. Google Groups is a far better alternative if you do not need open-source and need a mailing list that just works.",1451674873

And being &#x27;more possible&#x27; means that it must be happening more.<p>But &quot;why people choose the communities they align with&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem much different than &quot;why people have their opinions.&quot; Are we carefully choosing who we align ourselves with, any more than we&#x27;re choosing our opinions?<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any test for this, or any cure, other than making time to ruminate, meditate, and ponder. Alone.

The lunar year consists of 30-day and 29-day lunar months, generally alternating, with an embolismic month added periodically to bring the lunar cycle into line with the solar cycle. In each solar year (1 January to 31 December inclusive), the lunar month beginning with an ecclesiastical new moon (<i>JP note:  Not the astronomical full moon</i>) falling in the 29-day period from 8 March to 5 April inclusive is designated as the paschal lunar month for that year. Easter is the third Sunday in the paschal lunar month, or, in other words, the Sunday after the paschal lunar month's 14th day. The 14th of the paschal lunar month is designated by convention as the Paschal full moon, although the 14th of the lunar month may differ from the date of the astronomical full moon by up to two days.[46] Since the ecclesiastical new moon falls on a date from 8 March to 5 April inclusive, the paschal full moon (the 14th of that lunar month) must fall on a date from 21 March to 18 April inclusive.",1364740204

For instance (this may come across as snide although I do not intend it that way), is typing the word ""I"" in lower case and omitting spaces after periods a cultural thing? I would assume that nobody would use such a ""style"" in an essay on a standardized test, but then again I would have assumed that nobody would use such informal technique while arguing for the equivalence of a different writing style, since one would presumably want to criticize from a position of mastery to avoid accusations of making self-serving arguments.<p>It is true that spoken English contains many informalities that become inappropriate in the context of writing, but this observation holds regardless of ethnic influence on the spoken dialect. Everyone has to filter what they write to achieve the tone of formality. I certainly don't speak with the same formality I use in my writing, and I suspect you don't either.<p>If you want to argue that the culture in middle/upper class suburbia gives its children an advantage with respect to writing English, I would agree. I would suggest that the problem should be addressed by raising standards in inner city / rural environments, rather than by lowering them at universities, which would only serve to fuel attitudes of resentment and entitlement.<p>> The very bright poor that i personally know avoid the top schools because they require too many essays<p>What does this necessarily have to do with being poor? I know plenty of ""lazy"" rich people that avoid the same applications for the same reasons. How do you propose that culturally induced hesitation be distinguished from laziness? How should admissions boards distinguish between cultural influence and poor technique in an applicant's writing? These questions aren't rhetorical, I would love to hear answers, since I can think of none.<p>> The smart but poor have high critical reading and Math scores, but very low writing aptitude test scores.<p>I know plenty of people who share this profile for reasons that have nothing to do with being poor. I, myself tend towards this end of the score spectrum and I do not come from a poor family. Instead, my scores look like they do simply because I chose to focus my efforts in school on math and the sciences rather than on writing. Are you sure this is not the case with the people you were referring to?",1364739206

Pretty much everyone faces questions like the ones addressed in ""How To Do What You Love"" when they're growing up; those questions don't go away as you age, but you get enough context for them that they're not so hard to answer.<p>At that point, you start to notice that pretty much everyone younger than you has the same set of life stage problems and questions that you did. This is doubly true if you have a lot of exposure to high school students, college students, or recent grads, or if you write popular essays.<p>Rather than trying to answer the questions, and the thought behind the questions, piecemeal, it's easier to write one comprehensive answer and both direct people to it and let people find it on their own.<p>I can't guarantee that that was pg's line of reasoning, but I suspect it's reasonably close.",1364738928

It means that many smart kids go to schools close to home and are able to enrich their own communities by staying nearby. It means that those rural towns get great lawyers, doctors, and access to smart and talented people in dozens of other professions. If I'm from a rural state, I absolutely want my top state schools to compete with Harvard for talent. I don't want talented kids whisked away, never to return.<p>In my home state of Connecticut (home to one of those Ivy League bastions and a short drive from the others), many of the top students at my high school went to UCONN, got great educations, got great jobs in Connecticut (since locals know how good the education can be), and continue to contribute to the fabric of the state. Because so many people have gotten quality education at an affordable price, they encourage other top students to attend UCONN, donate money locally after they graduate, and create jobs for future students.<p>At first blush it feels unfair (certainly on an individual level). But it may actually result in a far better outcome for society. It certainly makes my home state a better place to live.",1364738535

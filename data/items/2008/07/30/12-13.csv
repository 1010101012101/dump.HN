Although there has been a considerable amount of ""unsuitable"" material make it to the front page of HN, there has also been a lot of pointless citation of this unsuitable material - to the degree that it dominates constructive dialog taking place.<p>HN is changing, no doubt, but as has been pointed out time and time again on HN, if it is of interest to the community at large, it belongs.  The community is changing (undeniable) but, maybe it is that sometimes posts other than an amazing O(N) bubble sort are also of interest...<p>I, for one, enjoy chuckling at XKCD - typically I just go there myself (without the aid of a social bookmark site!), but perhaps this one is just relevant enough to make it on HN... Or maybe I am wrong.",1217422769

261749,comment,250704,250704,0,0,tom234,,,"On ""new news:""<p>I'm not concerned about how the newspapers and producers like MSNBC and Washington Post create the story. The main problem is how do the search engine or whatever can search that news. The problem with Google News is that google is crawling and indexing all the webpage news like it was a webpage and it is not very up to date. If there was a fire right now, you won't see that in google right now. On the other hand, RSS is a different topic. First of all not all news producers have RSS. My main question is, if there is a flooding happening right now, what is the best way to find that information. You can't use google now, because they haven't crawled and indexed it. I'm thinking of news search/aggregator realtime. Another nice thing would be if I search ""flooding"" it should display many news sources so that I can get some perspective. What is the best way to approach this problem. Crawling and indexing is not the way to go I think if it is needed to be instant.",1217422631

261738,story,,,3,3,Novash,"Ask YC: On Cuil",,"I know this has probably been over debated lately. Everyone's saying the Cuil is a fail as a search engine. Am I the only one that noticed the detail that it seems to bring more results the more specific is the query?<p>I mean, I've read on a blog somewhere that Cuil doesn't bring any results for ""Cobol"". They even had a link. And it's true, it doesn't, BUT they offer those tabs with more specific queries like ""cobol compiler"", ""cobol jobs"" and such. And they DO bring results. While I don't know cobol and am unable to assert the relevance of the results, I am biased to believe that we've been using Cuil wrongly.<p>People have been wanting so badly for someone to beat Google at being Google that they pick very candidate and try to use it like they use Google. And this new search engine is bringing something new to us, a new way of search, and we are so locked into and used to the ""way of Google"" that we are blocking ourselves from trying new ways of doing things.<p>We are coders. We all know how is it like when we move from one language to another that has a totally different way of doing things. We complain, we curse, we swear to go back to our old language, but we bear it and then we 'get it'. And when we get it we can see the advantages, the disadvantages and understand when use one and when use other.<p>Maybe we should first try to learn the 'way of Cuil' before we dismiss it as another failure? I don't know, am I sounding too weird, or does it click into someone else like it did on me?",1217421599

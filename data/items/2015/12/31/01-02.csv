We have numerous case studies of 1 person or very small teams making really great Twitter apps (apps that actually influenced iOS design!).<p>Twitter has a ton of employees. Unless you actively believe the Mac app will hurt your business there should just be one full time engineer on it, someone who loves ObjC and UI design, who can use Twitter as a testbed for crazy UX ideas.

I don&#x27;t believe in an &quot;universal absolute moral truth&quot; (after all, where does it come from, and why?), but I think humans share enough of their basic morality to make it de-facto universal for us.

One of those responsibilities is to make your organization better.<p>And you shouldn&#x27;t think you&#x27;re getting paid to do a job. I&#x27;m going to do a job whether I get paid by my employer or not. What I&#x27;m getting paid for is to take my employers priorities and goals into consideration, and the strength of that consideration is proportional to the pay. If you don&#x27;t pay me very much, <i>my</i> priorities will be considered first, and one of <i>my</i> priorities from a workplace is to be comfortable and happy within a good organization -- I will work to help and support my friends and coworkers. So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll focus on. If you want me to &#x27;just do a job&#x27; or &#x27;maximize company profits&#x27;, you need to pay me extra, because I won&#x27;t care about those things for cheap.<p>You must be miserable at work if you think you&#x27;re getting paid to just do labor.

For that to work, you need to know that person says the truth. The most in-demand traits for a person (or smart agent or service) in the future will be &quot;trust&quot; (honesty, predictability, reliability).<p>In a world too complex to do everything yourself (milk the cow, mill the wheat, grow the tomatoes, to make a pizza), we need specialization and delegation. Again, delegating can only be seamless when interacting with parts whose &quot;trust&quot; is effectively tracked and measured.<p>The donated organ won&#x27;t go to the first person to ask for it, or the person with the most money. It will go to the best human, whose value might be tightly correlated with their trust score.<p>Big data, IoT, AI. All the big technologies of the present and future will increasingly rely on our ability to predict the future. That&#x27;s pretty much what logistics is. You can&#x27;t predict the future without a reliable system. Again, your predictions are just as solid as the weakest member in your chain. One component lies (or doesn&#x27;t do as promised), and the whole prediction breaks. That could mean minutes of commuting lost, or millions of people dead. Don&#x27;t lie, kids.<p>We need a more general term that encompasses more than just lying. A person needs to accurately understand his abilities in order to commit to a task. Failing to do so affects one&#x27;s score as if they did lie. I don&#x27;t see them as being different things. If you misinterpret something and communicate that interpretation, that&#x27;s also a &quot;lie&quot;.<p>In any case, I think the human brain is losing a lot of energy trying to decide what to say and not say, and whether what an other person say is sincere, polite, or plainly misleading. We&#x27;re not as smart as we could be, because of this social cancer. That&#x27;s probably what destroys kids as they grow.<p>Being honest at a job interview is a sure way not to get the job.

You'd probably need manual intervention to distinguish proxies and individual abusers. Once you're manually intervening, you may as well just wait until the poll closes and drop the results you don't want.",1240912532

I was not all that invested in programming at all, spending most of my time biking and playing music, but as a ""smart kid"" there was lots of ostracizing going around, just because I didn't play the main sport that <i>everyone</i> plays.<p>What I take away from this is the importance of growing up - you get through those stages and move into a more nurturing community of people that support what you create, not the details of how you created it.",1240912494

Right now it's a land grab, like the 90s on the web.<p>There was a story on the BBC I think, not long ago, about how it's basically impossible to make money on the App Store. You'll be ignored if you're not on the front page, and people are willing to only pay $0.99/app, it's just not viable. The only reasons to do it are a) for the love of it and b) to get your name out there ready for when there is some commercial demand.",1240911816
582914,comment,582350,582350,0,0,Jem,,,"(Insert big anecdotal evidence disclaimer here...)<p>It's not programmers that keep women out of programming (or IT in general). It's not the tools, the bad hours, the awkward guys, or the 'girls are bad at math'/'girls can't program' stereotypes. Right from the beginning I was pushed away from computers (before I'd even decided what field I wanted to apply myself to) by teachers, career advisers, college lecturers, friends, strangers, employers and sexist colleagues.<p>I remember being 13/14 and sitting down to an 'interview' with a career adviser. We had to answer a series of questions on screen which were supposed to tell us our ideal career. Every time I answered I could see that various computer related careers were climbing up the list, and yet I was told by the chap doing the interview that I should be a vet or a police officer. Neither made much sense to me.<p>My computing teacher in school used to prioritise computer access to the boys for after school 'computer club', and  although I did ICT at college (A levels in the UK), lecturers informed me that I would only be able to use the qualifications to get into admin/secretary jobs (boys were told otherwise). I was one of only two girls on my course at college, and the other girl dropped out by the end of the second year due to family pressure. My last boss used to make derogatory remarks about the fact that I was female, and colleagues supported my male colleague over me.<p>It's the attitude from everyone else that women can't and shouldn't get involved with computers that pushes women into other fields. I was lucky to have a very supportive family and a partner that wholeheartedly supports women in IT to push me through - oh, and being a stubborn bugger helped too :)",1240911666

Society suffers when everyone has to tiptoe around some deranged minority's wacky list of things to be outraged about.<p>No-one important that I know about has left the community because of this or any other contrived pseudo-scandal. Rails' popularity has not waned; rather the opposite. I could not care less if a small number of easily-offended prudes are scared away by a mild show of skin.

They couldn't be <i>that</i> incompetent. So it's reasonable to assume that the blacklisting wasn't working, which means the hack must've been mounted in a distributed fashion, which in turn implies it was ran over a botnet of some kind.

582895,comment,582686,582686,0,0,Luc,,,"The thing with sparklines is that, while curves seem to hold a certain fascination with a lot of people, I just don't see all that much utility in them, certainly not in my iPhone usage. For stock prices I consider curves less than useful, since it's natural but generally foolish to want to extrapolate from them. For temperature, I may want the highs and lows and perhaps a general trend (derivative), but a sparkline offers only a very low-fidelity version of that information.",1240909353

582891,comment,582606,582606,0,0,shalmanese,,,"I'm always slightly skeptical when people try and apply the lean process to software development. On the surface, there seems to be some nice analogies and you can kind of pretend that a unit test in software is the same as a unit test in manufacturing but the analogy quickly breaks down if you look at it more closely.<p>The correct analogy is not manufacturing == programming, it's design == programming && manufacturing == compiling. Lean manufacturing, as applied literally to software is to ensure that the output of your compiler contains no errant bits and 100% of software companies are in full compliance with lean. Software is probably the closest industry to achieving an actual six sigma defect rate.<p>However, applying lean principles to software development makes about as much sense as applying it to research & development. Nothing is ever consistent, nothing ever remains the same. Every compilation is the result of some change.<p>Are the general suggestions given in this video sensible advice? Sure, for the most part. But it seems more crammed to fit into a lean framework post-hoc than derived from genuinely lean principles.",1240909237

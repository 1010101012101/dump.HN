6553221,comment,6552875,6552875,4,0,jacquesm,,,"There are tons of commercial solutions that allow 3D printing of full-metal parts, the &#x27;metal age&#x27; for 3D printing happened a long time ago.<p>It&#x27;s mostly a matter of price point, can you do it cheaply enough to compete with other processes (small scale casting is expensive too). Large volume metal parts are as a rule cast (which technically is an additive process too) and then the rough part is reworked a bit.<p>The niche for 3D printed metal parts is an interesting intersection between turn around time, strength of the resulting part, precision and capital investment to buy a printer (or to be able to rent one). In the end it&#x27;s all economics.",1381845597

6553217,comment,6549617,6549617,1,0,lhorie,,,"A few notes from my own experience:<p>- think very hard about whether you want to use isolated scopes or not, because their presence affects the semantics of scope inheritance, and changing that decision after the fact can cause hard-to-debug issues in completely unrelated parts of your app. This is especially true if you&#x27;re using transclusions<p>- exposing events is tricky if you&#x27;re exposing model values because in those cases you need to call $digest before calling $apply. Another catch is that attaching the event trigger to a DOM event handler will often cause it to fire on programmatic model changes, which may or may not be what you want (it usually isn&#x27;t desirable to fire a change event when set the initial value of a field from the controller, e.g. to populate an edit page, in an app that does save-on-blur)",1381845465

If you&#x27;ve touched a college credit since high school, you&#x27;re not pure, and you won&#x27;t be considered alongside the more worthy students.&quot;<p>My actual experience with night school and tuition reimbursement was the opposite for more or less mid-level private uni (real school, 100 years old, not some kind of fly by night loan scam).  If you&#x27;re 18 and a HS senior they want you to jump thru hoops like a trained seal and write essays and take standardized tests and fill out applications and find references and ask for permission to be admitted and hope for weeks you&#x27;ll be lucky, but 19 as a professional studies night student, &quot;oh, hand me your check and a single page emergency contact / demographic type form, and you&#x27;re all good&quot;  Uh, say what, thats all the hoops you want me to jump thru?  Things may have changed a lot in the last decade, but it used to be the school was doing the student a huge favor if the student was 18, but even if you&#x27;re too young to drink, the instant you applied thru professional studies, you were doing them a huge favor, probably because financially, you were.<p>Transfer student experience was the same.  Oh you attended (insert medium sized name), well fill out a one page form, have them send us a transcript, and hand me a check and its all good.  Uh, say what, you make 18 year old HS students jump thru hoops like trained seals but all I have to do to get in is let you know my next of kin in case of medical emergency, and give you a check and a transcript?  What?<p>Now for transfer students a big game is only allowing X credits where X is pretty small, or not permitting certain classes to transfer in at all, which is how I got to take calculus three times, once in HS, and twice, at college and uni.  So they may have screwed transfer students over once they admit them, but at least the admittance process was painless.",1381845252

Next you could collect a few other pointers such as the optional courses a student has taken, their interest in particular industry or field, the people they admire, the place/country they would like to work in etc. All of these can serve as signal to what this person wants. You can even collect these attributes, and some data about the people who are already successful in the industry and build a neural network or some other algo that predicts the most fruitful path for a graduate. All this will give you signals where to concentrate your efforts w.r.t. an individual.<p>As for reading my mind, that&#x27;s a little more involved and probably unprofitable/unscalable venture. But just because you asked, i will take a shot. I have always thought about a placement agency where I am not the one being sold but I buy the services of this agency to be on a lookout for jobs/opportunities for me. If this agency manages to become reputable, then companies will seek their help to staff their projects. Once the project is over I move to next interesting thing regardless of the company. I imagine this sounds like a very good consulting firm, but in my version the agency is to be honest to make its money purely from me either as direct fees or retainer or whatever. I should not have an iota of doubt that they will sell my resume to xyz company for a bunch of money and shaft me. The customers of this company will be people like me who are introverts and absolute retards at networking. That&#x27;s not a pledge to buy anything :-) I think what you are doing is good.

Keep in mind that just dropping in a cc requirement into your a sign up process created around frictionless trials will probably fail. To get a person&#x27;s payment details, you need to do more work upfront. You can&#x27;t have 2 second landing page->signup for people who have never heard of you before. They won&#x27;t give you a CC just to find out what you do.<p>Credit card frost has two big advantages:<p>1- It&#x27;s easier to optimize. The conversion process is simpler and more controlled. With a fricitonless trial, improving your process of herding people into a free trial can be like pulling on a string, it gets shorter on the other end. You signed up more unengaged/uninterested people, so your trial->payment rates are lower. Obviously, this is only an advantage if you put a lot of effort into the optimization.<p>2- It takes advantage of some human psychological tendencies.

Leaving your iPad untouched and just make a coffee or something during download? Well, as soon as your iPad goes to sleep/standby the download will stop.<p>Of course I have to admit that I&#x27;m on a slow connection (1 megabit/s), which is a problem for several 100 MB of size per issue, but this brings me to the last flaw, which is the filesize itself. Just think about this - you&#x27;re actually downloading a collection of very large PDFs. The New Yorker isn&#x27;t very heavy on media and rather text-based - and while there are certain sections that come as true, lighweight and selectable text, there&#x27;s no reason to ship the majority of every issue as giant images of text.

Often in Lisp and other languages, the verbal diagram &quot;a list of lists of ...&quot; is adequate to represent a tree along with a description of its interesting properties.

The same is generally true about other traditional communication mediums - Designers for magazines understand magazine printing and often have related tools, for example.<p>Likewise, CSS is not only declarative, but a rules based DSL for presentation - definitely in the realm of designers (and conceptually an underpinning upon which you could build even simpler tooling).<p>Where this has broken down and caused the kind of confusion i think the article discusses IMO is that the creation of HTML is very frequently (almost always traditionally) assembled via another system which is less so - asp/jsp for example were Turing complete languages mixed with templating.  So it took engineers to make the dom serialization in the first place.  Then as things moved client side we had script managing the DOM too.  Combined with very limited semantic/expressive powers in HTML and CSS, the marriage between the three often put the two disciplines at odds with one another.

That way an available proper&quot; random source is feeding the pool as early as possible, before any user-space tool pumping data from a generator to the pool could be started. It is increasingly common for chipsets/CPUs to have some form of HWRNG circuitry built in.<p>Or is that deemed an over-complication (and potential point of failure) for something that is not currently available on most devices? I&#x27;m thinking of chipsets like the SoC used in the RPi which has a built-in HWRNG that is easily accessible once the appropriate module is loaded, and recent Intel CPUs which have one (though I don&#x27;t know if that is as easy to access ATM).<p><i>> is that when userspace tries to generate long-term public keys immediately after the machine is taken out of the box and plugged in, that there isn&#x27;t a sufficient amount of entropy</i><p>I&#x27;ve wondered if this is something we can at least partially address by adding a property to those assigned via DHCP or similar protocols so as well as telling a new device what address it should respond to (and the usual other properties such as name resolution settings and potentially hostname and so forth) would there be room in the protocol to include a small block of random data? If the network setup is done early enough during boot then there will be at least some entropy in the pool before other process start needing it.<p>Of course this would require that the device handing out addresses and names had a sufficient entropy source of its own, potentially a HWRNG, in order to be able to provide this random data at the rate needed by the prevailing network conditions (the worst case being at if all the hosts on a large subnet pop online at the same time due to recovery from a power-cut and so all want their block of bits at the same time). Also it wouldn&#x27;t help devices that might not have any network access on first boot but might still need to generate keys ready for when access is available.",1381844076

I also find it somewhat difficult to accept the idea that no such guarantee will be made, yet I will still be punished if I reduce the quality of service for my neighbors -- either there is a guarantee, in which case I should be throttled in a way that ensures everyone enjoys at least that service level, or there is no guarantee in which case consuming lots of bandwidth is simply rude (but not something that should be punished).<p>Frankly, I think this solution is not so bad:  I get lower priority as I consume more bandwidth, until I am getting only the minimum throughput for my service class.

Let&#x27;s look at some of them:<p>1.  Monte Carlo Simulations<p>2.  Wiping disk files that might contain sensitive information.<p>3.  Padding in crypto applications<p>4.  Initialization Vectors (IV&#x27;s)<p>5.  Session keys / D-H key agreement<p>6.  Long-term keys for users<p>7.  Country-level TLD keys for things like DNSSEC<p>These uses have been rank ordered roughly in order of cryptographic strength that might required. Very often, I&#x27;ve found that people who are complaining about the speed of /dev/urandom are using it for something that it wasn&#x27;t designed for; for example, &quot;dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hda&quot; to wipe a disk.<p>And similarly, for people who insist that there is no good difference/distinction between /dev/urandom and /dev/random, they are only thinking of their use case, and/or they aren&#x27;t considering that there might be a difference between generating a long-term public key for GPG (which today tends to use /dev/random for this purpose, and I think rightly so), and generating a one-time session key when encrypting a message using GPG.   Since you only do the first once, a bit more inconvenience might be tolerated by the user.  (Today this takes about ten minutes on a laptop, and part of the reason for this is that Chrome is positively profligate with how it uses randomness, including a 32k read from /dev/urandom[!] at startup, and this is draining the entropy available for /dev/random, which slows it down significantly.  I have a change pending upstream which time-limits the amount of entropy that can be drawn from the input pool to the nonblocking pool to protect our entropy from abusive users of /dev/urandom, and I have on my todo list tracking down some chrome developers to figure out what the heck they are doing with all of their demands on /dev/urandom.)<p>The reality is that strong random numbers is a precious resource, and you can&#x27;t use it willy-nilly.  Furthermore, the strength of random numbers is a continuum; it is not a binary &quot;strong&quot; vs. &quot;not strong&quot; distinction.  I&#x27;m sure it would be very convenient for userspace programmers to be able to assume that randomness is always freely available, and that it only comes in two flavors, &quot;insecure&quot; and &quot;secure&quot;, but that&#x27;s not the way the world works.<p>Even in the case of hardware random number generators, there are tradeoffs.  This is why future Intel processors will be making a distinction between RDRAND (for which you can&#x27;t assume that two 128 bit RDRAND outputs, when put together, will give you 256 bits of entropy), and RDSEED (which does have this guarantee).   And of course, there is also the tradeoff between the auditability of /dev/random and the non-auditability of something which is locked in a complex piece of Silicon.<p>TL;DR.   I&#x27;d like to have a Personal Gulfstream Jet, and enough money that it&#x27;s not a big deal to consider a $12 million dollar home in La Jolla to be teardwon fodder.

I mean, yeah, it&#x27;s a bad thing for them, in the same way that it&#x27;s bad whenever someone has to contribute to society to any meaningful degree.<p>These complaints about an individual&#x27;s premium going up massively (e.g. 100%) under ACA appear to be mostly the result of extremely limited plans being phased out and replaced with more comprehensive ones. That is, the old cheap plan barely covered anything but technically qualified as insurance. The new, more expensive plan that&#x27;s the minimum includes much more broad coverage. Part of tackling extremely high costs for health care is having more things covered so providers don&#x27;t have to write them off; currently people with little or no insurance coverage get care and stick the rest of us with the costs. The idea here is to expand the coverage so those folks who used to have pseudo-insurance that didn&#x27;t actually cover much would have proper coverage (which costs more than the skimpy plan they previously had).<p>It is a pain and a burden for some people? Sure, just like everything else in life. Policies change all the time and there are always winners and losers; the best policy in the world ends up impacting someone negatively.

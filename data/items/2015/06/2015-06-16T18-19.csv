9728043,comment,9726341,9727792,0,0,boken,,,"That&#x27;s not what happened. The account of a current Astros employee—formerly a member of the Cardinals&#x27; front office—was compromised. Maybe the Astros have some bookkeeping issues to deal with, but in this case it seems to have been this employee&#x27;s fault from front to back. When he was in St. Louis, he wrote down his password(s) in a &quot;master password file,&quot; which he did not erase on leaving that organization. Then, when he started up in Houston, he reused the passwords he had been using in St. Louis to set up his corporate account(s). It seems that a current Cardinals employee got a hold of this man&#x27;s password list, decided to give the Houston account a go, and found that he never bothered to change his own locks.<p>As for remote access, I imagine the scouting department would slow down greatly without it, though I don&#x27;t know precisely what their workflow is like.",1434481179

That is, the people in charge of whistleblowing cases did the evidence destruction, probably in response to bad PR.<p>This is infuriating on several levels. It seems like if Drake hadn&#x27;t gotten sympathetic press coverage and public support, the DoJ would have tried to railroad him on espionage charges.

With concurrency, if you can prove that during the contracted period you had billable work outside the contract then that goes in your favour if you get nabbed and the contract is borderline.

What happens if someone else is running benchmarks at the same time? Benchmarks are best run on isolated hardware, which is why it&#x27;s so hard to find good benchmarks. Who has server-class hardware lying around to just run benchmarks on?<p>2) Expressing results in percentile format is great! Using line graphs to represent the data, not so much. Line graphs are used to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; between points of data. When you draw a line between two points, you&#x27;re saying, &quot;for these x-axis values, the y-value is approximately <i>this</i>&quot;. This infers a progression, which isn&#x27;t really relevant for percentile data. A clustered column or bar chart would be a better fit for this data, IMO.<p>3) A histogram of response time is often informative. Just be careful with your bin width.

If you review the implementation requirements, included is a brief rationale for each test type:<p><a href=""https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=code"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=code</a><p>For example, the &quot;plaintext&quot; test focuses on raw request routing and HTTP parsing throughput and is intended to allow ultra-high performance servers to shine.  Meanwhile, the &quot;fortunes&quot; test is intended to exercise a more diverse spectrum of framework functionality including database connectivity, the ORM, dynamic-sized collections, in-memory sorting, server-side templates, and XSS countermeasures.<p>Future tests in our project will likely exercise still more framework and platform capabilities, and with more computationally-demanding requirements.  I believe this will go further to demonstrate the appeal of high-performance platforms and frameworks.  Presently, it is easy to point out that few applications require the capacity to serve 10,000 or 100,000 requests per second.  I routinely suggest that a real-world application is likely to perform at 1% to 10% of the high-water mark we show.  Where it gets interesting, then, is determining if 10% of 50,000 rps or 10% of 500 rps is workable for you.<p>Despite conventional wisdom that suggests that a web service is constrained by external systems such as databases and peer services—and not dismissing that as untrue, but rather exaggerated—we believe that real-world web applications are often constrained by the platform or framework.  In fact, it is my opinion that selecting a high-performance framework and platform (that suits your development efficiency requirements!) is precisely how you avoid premature optimization.  By making a reasonable decision early on, you defer scale pain that is all too common with low-performance platforms until later in your project&#x27;s life-cycle.  Do you want to bring out the big architecture guns and increased system complexity at 10,000 users or at 100,000 or 1,000,000 users?  Indeed, nothing is a drop-in replacement for something you know and love.  There will be some learning curve if you&#x27;re moving from one framework to another, and even greater learning is needed if switching platforms or language.  But these inflection points in programming are needed sometimes, and you may find it&#x27;s good to position them at the start of a project rather than midstream.",1434478273

It leaves some gaps and presents it in a way that I am not fond of, but that&#x27;s just me and I&#x27;m far from  your typical learner. That said, be prepared for a long, dark rabbit hole ;-)<p>Depending on the level of &quot;off the shelf&quot; you&#x27;re looking to deal with, a MIDI controller can be as simple as a USB controlled MIDI chip hooked up to some switches, or as complicated as a manually implemented digital synthesizer that talks to a USB bridge (don&#x27;t try to implement a USB controller as your first, or tenth project).<p>Regarding kit/components, the key is trying to strike a balance between knowing what you want <i>before</i> you buy anything, and not waiting too long to start experimenting with real components. You can save yourself a lot of time by simulating the basic circuits in your project using a software like LTSpice[0] or TINATI[1]. They&#x27;re both free and easy to use. However, simulations are never good enough, and often you don&#x27;t have a model to simulate some important piece of your circuit, so the picture isn&#x27;t complete. A good approach is to sketch out the circuits you want, do a quick sim or two to see if the basics like your power supply or oscillator or digital logic are going to basically do what you think, then order all the components you need from digikey. Shipping under $200 costs $8 from digikey, so it pays not to make too many orders. The bonus is that they are <i>extremely</i> timely with their orders (in US and Canada anyhow). Sometimes unbelievably so.<p>A note when ordering things from Digikey: First, make sure all the parts a in stock (check &quot;in stock&quot; in the search params). Back ordered parts take a long time, and for almost any part you can imagine there is a comparable replacement in stock. Second, when you want low volume stuff you&#x27;ll be wanting the &quot;cut tape&quot;, &quot;bulk&quot;, &quot;tube&quot;, or &quot;tray&quot; packaging options. &quot;Tape and reel&quot; or &quot;Digi-reel&quot; are for big rolls of one component and this the minimum order is 1000+ units. Almost everything is available in one of the low-volume options.<p>Regarding kits, take a look at sparkfun[2] for a wide range of boards, kits, etc. They have some good stuff and are targetted at hobbyists. A lot of their products come with not only a datasheet, but also a simplified &quot;hookup diagram&quot; that tells you how to wire everything up for a typical application. You can get some kits of basic components like resistors and caps, but they tend to get pricey and I always found that I would use one or two of the components up and never touch the rest, i.e. use all of the 10k resistors and the 1uF caps and nothing else. If there&#x27;s a kit specifically for the project you want go for it though.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.linear.com/designtools/software/#LTspice"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linear.com/designtools/software/#LTspice</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ti.com/tool/tina-ti"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ti.com/tool/tina-ti</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/157"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/157</a>",1434478253

A well-documented, complete standard library (like in Go, for example) takes precedence over community IMHO.<p>Even as a Node.js dev, I don&#x27;t understand the obsession with creating userland modules, and the value in modularity. Yes, a large library of modules correlate with community involvement, but it does not necessarily mean quality.",1412647193

I only think about it sometimes, but got a promising set of ideas.<p>A possible protocol for using pseudonyms could be that people create a random IDs at home, and get them signed under a public setup very like our current setup for voting - several people sign it, and each person signs a limited number of IDs. Those people then give the signatures to the voter, and mark in a control that he got the ID. An ID is valid if it has all the signatures.<p>Ideally we should assure that no data lives the setup after the procedure - but just lighting everything on fire will never feel good enough to be implemented, so I&#x27;m out of ideas here.<p>This protocol still has a grave flaw, the electors can prove how they voted. Impossibility of proof is at odds with verification, but I still think there must be a way to make the proof physically hard.",1412647155

Educated people tend to be well informed and hold sensible opinions on global warming, vaccination, and education (and often hold silly opinions on nutrition, even though there is a very strong incentive).  Economics is unique as something where people disdain the mainstream.<p>One notable difference (you can see it in this thread) is that people assume economists are somehow different from other academics.  That academics in general can be trusted, but economists are sellouts.  What they miss is that there is no significant difference between Economics as a field, and other fields.  They get paid slightly more, but otherwise the journals, professional organizations, tenure committees, etc. are exactly the same.  There is literally no point where the capitalist comes along with bags of money for his obedient intellectual servants.<p>The real reason people don&#x27;t accept the mainstream is that it is very dismal.  It says that your revealed preference proves that you value a cup of coffee in every morning over the life of an African (since you could donate that money to life saving charities).  It says that inequality can&#x27;t be fully ironed out because some people are more productive than others.  It says that there is no way to shuffle around interest rates, bank accounts, etc. and make everyone better off.  It says that there is no easy way to make the world better, because the free market has already maxed out the easy gains.<p>Personally, I think that the best way to encourage people to be more open to the mainstream, is to tell the other side of the store.  Economics is also uplifting.  It says that when you work for a company, you are creating value, and that that value can and does help people other than yourself (through the tax system).  I also believe that tech has very large positive externalities (especially once you understand that taking people&#x27;s jobs isn&#x27;t an externality).  Finally, it enables people to embrace the positive, self-affirming aspects of Ayn Rand&#x27;s philosophy, without going to extremes.  I do feel guilty that I don&#x27;t do more for the people who are worst off.  But at least I can enjoy my money, and my life, without feeling guilty that I&#x27;m driving some artist out of the current trendy area.",1412645395

Everyone has a price and rules are only rules unless you have the resources to bend them for yourself. Yes this happens in Western culture as well, the big difference is the both degree and how prevalent it is. e.g. it is much harder to bribe a police officer or teacher here than it is in China. Over here it&#x27;s an extraordinary event; over there it&#x27;s mundane. So how do things work in a low trust society? If you can&#x27;t rely on the rule of law to be consistently fair, you rely on your family. I&#x27;m not just talking immediate family. I&#x27;m talking about your cousins, and not just your immediate cousins; people over there rely on extended relatives as well like second or third cousins. That&#x27;s your network of stability. Everything and everyone else (short of close friends) don&#x27;t matter. In general you put your family ahead of yourself and your personal desires i.e. You don&#x27;t study philosophy even though that&#x27;s your love; you go into something practical like being a doctor or computer engineer (yes we have that here as well, but again the difference is the degree)... If there&#x27;s any culture that truly adheres to the psychological theories of evolution, it&#x27;s Chinese culture.<p>One more thing: It&#x27;s a society of pragmatic pessimists, which I feel is yet another reason Chinese society has against it when it comes to innovation.",1412644952

Every aspect of the maker movement, aside from perhaps 3D printers, has pre-maker movement roots. In other words the maker movement is a popularising movement, a rebranding of what came before. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, I&#x27;m glad more people are being encouraged to create, but I do not appreciate people trying to rewrite history to bolster their own narrative.",1412644316

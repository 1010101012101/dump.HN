Portability across platforms with .Net isn't easy, that's for sure.<p>For OSS .net projects I've been involved with, we've made conscious decisions about code distribution. Those included unit tests (we chose nUnit) and builds (VS sln files). Did we forego all those mono developers? Well, yes and no. Yes, in theory; no, in terms of anyone who was using our code in a Mono environment. To bridge the gap, we rolled a MonoDevelop project file, and put up some info about it on our wiki.

And I generalize this to any such language that has this characteristic, not just Scala. You can't use C++ for very long without having to know huge swathes of it if you want to use the libraries created by others, and you want to be able to debug why they don't work perfectly. (Bearing in mind ""working perfectly"" also includes you having a correct mental model of how they work, which is tricky if you only have a subset of the language in your head!) Same for Haskell. Compare with Python, where you basically <i>can</i> learn a reduced subset of the language, yet still use libraries fairly effectively. You need to know the basics of having objects and calling methods. You don't need to know how to write your own iterator, any of the double-underscore methods or the resulting protocols, you <i>probably</i> don't need to know decorators (and even if you do, probably just how to use them, because they are unlikely to bite you in odd ways if you just copy-paste instances of them), you don't need to know metaclasses, etc.<p>Type systems of almost any kind are very hard to satisfy without understanding.

I'd much prefer you tell me the name of the popular Windows/Mac client and walk me through the workflow I'll actually use on a day-to-day basis.<p>To be perfectly clear, the command line tools ARE the popular client. The only widely used GUI I'm aware of is the one specific to Github. There are others but they generally expect you to be familiar with the command line workflow. Perhaps this is because Git is easily integrated into IDEs in a way that makes sense for that particular IDE; perhaps it's because the command line interface is actually very good, with features like spelling suggestions (if you've mistyped a command name) and autocompletion scripts (sort of like IntelliSense).<p>By the way, I can't speak for Windows users but the overwhelming majority of Mac and Linux developers are well aware that their shiny GUIs are thin layers over the gross 70s Unix parts underneath. In this world there's no stigma concerning beards or the 70s, and your dismissal of the command line comes across as backwards and absurd.

The printing press was invented. Luther, the first media evangelist, frightened the Roman Catholic Church. As part of the inquisition, Spain suppressed the press.

Signing ecommerce transactions.",,"I had this idea the other day and in doing research, surprisingly, I've yet to find someone taking this approach for b2c ecommerce. Digitally signing invoices for b2b ecommerce seems to be a slightly more common practice, at least in Europe.<p>Here's the idea: An identity service that sits between merchants and credit card processors that signs transactions. This would seem to be an effective way to reduce credit card fraud.<p>Every customer would have an identity/username/email with the service and a corresponding private/public key stored on our servers. The merchant asks us to sign a transaction, (which would be some nonce plus a username or something, it wouldn't hold credit card numbers), using the users private key. The payment processor makes an api call to our service to verify the customer is who they say they are and then verifies it has seen the customer use this credit card before. If not, it looks like potential fraud.<p>Verified by Visa and Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) seem to be similar solutions but with obvious drawbacks.<p>There are some obvious problems, but nothing seems insurmountable. So I'm surprised to find nobody is really working on something like this.<p>Here are some problems I see:\n1. Adding an extra hurdle to the checkout process might be completely unpalatable to most merchants<p>2. How do you know you can trust someone the first time they sign a transaction?<p>3. Storing private keys in the cloud -- scary.<p>4. It's extra work for payment processors to implement this feature. Why would they?<p>I'm very interested in any feedback from someone who works in this space. I suspect my inexperience with payments is why I'm thinking this would be a good idea.",1326137454

First of all, the things he shows aren't inherently complex:  adding an additional function to the existing collections library is something that's possible in other languages in less confusing ways (see other examples in this post).  The various <i>concepts</i> required to solve the problem in Scala like implicits and higher kinds might be inherently complex, but the <i>problem</i> he's trying to solve isn't inherently complex.  And while the Scala solution might not be 100% identical to, say, just adding the method directly to a class in Ruby (since in Scala it's type-safe, etc. etc.) that's still missing the point.  The point is that if you sit down and say ""I want to add a method to all my collections that works like the existing methods,"" in Scala it requires an understanding of a huge number of complicated intersecting concepts, whereas in other languages it doesn't.<p>Secondly, excusing complexity by saying ""it makes things possible that wouldn't otherwise be possible"" isn't really enough of a justification.  The question is:  do those exact things <i>need</i> to be possible?  Or is there some way that gets me 90% of the way there without the complexity, and that's good enough?  More power isn't always better, which was a big part of the point of the article.  Just dismissing it by saying ""well, the complexity lets you do powerful things"" doesn't really refute the point of the article, it totally misses it.<p>There's a tradeoff to be made.  You might make those tradeoffs differently than I would, which is totally understandable, but we should at least be able to have a conversation about the fact that there is such a tradeoff without people dimissing statements like ""Scala is complex"" out-of-hand.",1326136324

284621,comment,283983,284609,0,0,icey,,,"Respectfully, that's advice on how to not be poor before it's advice on how to get rich. To be rich, you have to consider the way you make your money. Getting paid lots of money per hour is not going to make you rich on your own 99 times out of 100 (the other time being those people who make $1000 an hour or something), because as soon as you stop working, that income stream is gone. You can only also work so many hours in a day. Investing helps, for sure; and many people have gotten rich that way. However, investing on its own has a very slow velocity for someone getting started. The best way (from what I can tell) is to find a way to decouple the money you make from the amount of time you have invested in it. That means royalties or licensing fees for something you have created or own the rights to.",1219498763

Be a good experiment.<p>But if you're trying to test run for the world, a resort island doesn't prove anything. Israel's just small enough to be feasible. But it's big enough & 'normal' enough to be applicable to most European Countries. It's also got a big advantage that a large number of cars are leased by employers as part of salary packages. Similar advantage to the rentals in Hawaii.",1219497193

Moving from FF2 to FF3 I saw noticeable improvements in the application responsiveness, especially in moving DOM objects around the window (ala draggable dialog boxes full of objects), mouse event handling, and in generation of new DOM children.

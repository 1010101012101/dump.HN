We had gathered at a local pub, and a Parisian friend asked for a hamburger &quot;cooked rare&quot;.  The waitress responded &quot;I don&#x27;t think we can do that&quot;, which elicited the obvious reply &quot;of course you can, just take it off the grill sooner&quot;.<p>At this point we stepped in to explain that it was a matter of food safety laws, and the beef used for hamburgers in Canada really wasn&#x27;t safe unless it was well cooked... and that, contrary to stereotypes about North American cuisine, we all understood that good quality meat shouldn&#x27;t be ruined by overcooking.<p>He agreed to have a legal hamburger, but only on the condition that it was overcooked as little as possible.",1439027904

So I&#x27;ve now moved to the part 3 of the article, let&#x27;s see the conclusion:<p>&quot;I think my 17-year-old self would find that pretty galling. He’d signed up to medicine to save loads of lives, and he’d find it a bit of a downer to see this his entire medical career would likely do as much good as a £10 000 donation to the right charity. But that would be the wrong way of looking at things: instead, he should see that saving 17 lives is a vast amount of good, and being able to do 30 times more good on top of that is awesome.&quot;<p>Well... sounds a bit better. But the whole series still looks more like an excuse for somebody to forgo his medical career (also from the Part 3):<p>&quot;If I become willing to work as a doctor, then I increase the supply of doctors. If more people are willing to be doctors, then the NHS can slightly decrease the wages for doctors (1). If the wages are slightly lower, the budget can be used to hire slightly more doctors.<p>How this all balances out is studied by economists. If the labour market for doctors is in equilibrium, then increasing the supply of doctors by one doctor, will probably increase the number of doctors by about 0.6 (2).&quot;<p>I&#x27;d like to know if the article author really grew up to be a doctor or if he&#x27;s now some activist in some charity instead.<p>Take a look at what the site suggests as the &quot;right careers&quot; for impact after I&#x27;ve filled the &quot;career guide&quot;:<p>1) Management consulting (for skill-building & earning to give)<p>2) Foundation grantmaker<p>3) Think tank research<p>4) Economics PhD<p>Well if the guys who end up on this position only know to count megadeaths and QALYs before, I really doubt they will even understand what they decide about.

10026771,comment,10022014,10026714,0,0,ForlorneHopes,,,"> It depends on how you interpret the XKCD comic<p>Unless either of us can find Randall explaining his intent somewhere (and even then; death of the author probably applies - how sytse used the comic is equally important) all we can do is go by it&#x27;s working. The comic doesn&#x27;t say &quot;The First Amendment&quot;, it says &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot;.<p>I won&#x27;t say that the average netizen shouting freedom of speech is educated on the philosophy of liberty or has read JS Mill (I haven&#x27;t, I need too). But when they say freedom of speech about forums. Freedom of Speech is still a human right, not a clause in the USA constitution. I still think it&#x27;s a strawman to respond by pointing the limits of the First Amendment.<p>> Of course, Mill assumed that most people are capable of rational thought, and would generally move towards a more correct view of the world when exposed to a marketplace of ideas. The internet doesn&#x27;t always work like that. However, the alternative to &quot;free speech&quot; is echo chambers, which is probably worse.<p>On Liberty was written in 1859. It&#x27;s an indisputable fact that in all forms of social justice - sexual equality, racial equality, LGBT rights, and far far more - things have been improved enormously during the last 66 years. If Mills ideas have either influenced or reflected the political philosophies of the those 66 years then clearly he&#x27;s onto something.<p>Even the internet doesn&#x27;t change much, human nature is still human nature. Besides, to pick a date, the internet has only been influential since September 1993. Social justice has mostly gotten better since 1993 even if online discourse has gotten worse. It&#x27;s premature to say we the world is too different to go by On Liberty.<p>After 66 years of liberty bringing progress we should only attempt to replace liberal ideas with the utmost care, thought and deliberation. And when I see people arguing to limit freedom of speech, I do not see that care and deliberation; if I did a comic saying that Freedom of Speech was merely a clause in one country&#x27;s legal code would never have gotten popular.<p>> But I don&#x27;t see why GitLab has any real responsibility to allow stuff that&#x27;s not code (or is just joke code) - it&#x27;s not a really a marketplace of ideas, it&#x27;s a place to share code.<p>If they had a clearly written rule saying only code is aloud, or only code and documentation relating to code is aloud then that would be fine.<p>However once GitLab starts judging repositories based on the ideas they contain and deleting legal repositories they dislike then they have crossed the line.",1439025673

That&#x27;s wrong.<p>The counterexample: the kid breaks the leg. The leg will &quot;heal&quot; even without the operation, but the form will be altered: the kid will never be able to walk normally, do the sport normally, anything you imagine (a). A few operations are performed on the kid&#x27;s leg, afterwards he walks normally, lives the rest of his life normally (b). Now if the person having the problems in (a) lives the same number of years as the fully healthy (b) the statistics the whole article calculation is based don&#x27;t show any contribution of the given operations, whereas these operations really did &quot;save life&quot; in the sense of giving somebody a healthy life that he otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have.<p>There are immense number of equivalent examples and all are ignored in the article. Much more lives are effectively  &quot;saved&quot; by the modern medicine than the author can see. We can also consider the lives of the family of the patient also effectively &quot;destroyed&quot; without the medicine.<p>(In short, the article appeared as (stereotypically said, more as the strong figure of speech not actually addressed at the specific author) written by 20-something male who hasn&#x27;t first-hand experienced medical problems even in his family. I wasn&#x27;t able to find more about &quot;Gregory Lewis&quot; who wrote it, but the whole &quot;80,000 Hours&quot; project site, on which this 2012 article was published was the result of the 2011 initiative of two Oxford students, and maybe that gives some idea about the setting.)",1439024929

When Sidecar started, they looked carefully at the existing laws and crafted their product to stay, to their best judgement, on the exact right side of the law. That&#x27;s why, in early Sidecar, for example, drivers negotiated directly with passengers for the fare and why sidecar cars carried no visible exterior markings.<p>Lyft and Uber decided to play the much higher risk/higher reward game of antagonizing regulators in exchange for better product. In the early days of the rideshare war, the Lyft pink mustaches were everywhere and everyone was made aware that Lyft existed due to them.<p>It&#x27;s an excellent example of how &quot;playing clean&quot; is not always in an entrepreneur&#x27;s best interest and how luck and a willingness to take risk can alter fortunes on a profound scale.",1439024594

203420,comment,203193,203193,0,0,jrockway,,,"It's unfortunate that he thinks Perl is one of those lanagues (like PHP and COBOL) that you ""shouldn't use"" because it's useless, dead, broken, whatever.  PHP gets a lot of hate because it's completely broken.  The designers knew nothing about programming when they designed it, and that shows up every time someone writes a PHP site.<p>But I digress.  Perl is not in the same class as PHP, it's in the same class as Ruby and Python.  I think it actually one-ups those languages in a variety of places, actually.  Perl has predictable scoping rules, unlike Ruby; and you can have multi-line anonymous functions, unlike Python :)  I know this sounds like a broken record, but Perl's culture of libraries is something other languages really need to steal.  The best part of using Perl is the code that you <i>don't</i> write ;)<p>Anyway, just thought I would clear this up.  The world has a lot of hate for Perl, but it's mostly unfounded.  Perl back in 1996 sucked, but programmers back in 1996 sucked.  In the last few years, Perl has attracted a ton of exceptional programmers, and we have some really nice stuff now.

If having Feature X really would make my web application development significantly easier, somebody would have already written a language or environment that used it.""<p>I see this kind of thinking applied to a multitude of subjects and it never makes any sense. The market isn't some static thing that has already rendered its final judgement - the competitive landscape is constantly changing and (in this particular example) python or ruby programmers extolling the virtues of their language to PHP programmers and convincing them that it is better is a vital component of python/ruby gaining greater market share.<p>This type of thinking can be used to discourage absolutely anything that is new - ""if its so good, why hasn't someone already done it? If it is not already done, it must therefore suck"".<p>In fact, it reminds of a joke about the conservatism of Canadian VCs: The entrepreneur goes to the VC and pitches his business. Being somewhat conservative, the VC asks him ""Well, if your idea is great, why hasn't someone from the Valley already invested in it?""",1212079482

Seeing how someone approaches a simple coding exercise tells you a lot about their techniques.<p>Two examples stand out:<p>1) A guy who had more Java certifications than had eaten hot dinners couldn't complete the simple exercise after three or four hours of effort.<p>2) Guy initially attempted to hit Google up for examples (why not!), and on finding that the net connection was disabled for that user account, wrote the best solution to the exercise I've received.<p>Overall, my interviewing process has had two stages. First, talk to the candidate and get a sense of what kind of person they are, and if they'll fit in with the culture. Second, if they seem reasonable, give them the test and see what their code is like. It's not foolproof, but it does weed out most of the weaker candidates.",1212079437

203401,comment,203236,203386,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"To expand upon this, you also cannot usefully compare load between two applications of the same type.  e.g. comparing the load averages of Apache vs. LigHTTPD vs. nginx, is not useful.  Depending on the architecture of the application, such as threaded, forked, select/poll-based, or event-based, and configuration, you may find significantly different load numbers, even if all are performing identical tasks and with identical ""performance"".<p>For example Squid, in its aufs configuration (which uses threads for disk IO), can exhibit extremely high load averages (>5) on even a moderately loaded system.  It'll still be performing fine, and you may still have significant headroom for handling requests.  But it looks really high, on Linux systems.  Even the filesystem on which a service is running can make a difference.  Load looks higher on a ReiserFS-based system running Squid than an Ext3 filesystem...and yet the Reiser system would handle more load (I guess it just doesn't hide the evidence of its work very well).",1212079309

Wishes aren't horses.<p>UHC advocates claim that the US would spend 10% with UHC.  Let's see what that would mean.<p>The US spends about 15% of GDP on healthcare.  Of that 15%, about half is spent by govt while the other half is private.  Curiously enough, the govt covers about the same number of people as private spending.<p>For argument's sake, let's say that the govt currently spends 7% of gdp on health care.  If govt is only going to spend 10% to cover just the people who currently have health care, that means that it will only spend 3% to cover the folks that are currently in the private system.  (Yes, I'm ignoring the uninsured, but they just make the numbers worse.)<p>I'll repeat that - UHC folk are promising that the govt will cover the people it doesn't cover now for less than half what it pays to cover the people it covers today.<p>If you want to argue that UNC can do health care for 10% of gdp, start by fixing govt health care so it only spends 5% of gdp to cover the people it covers today.<p>You can kill private health care by simply opening up govt health care at cost if it's actually cheaper and better.  However, as long as it isn't.....<p>Until govt health care is actually cheaper than private, it's absurd to argue that it will be.  Govt health care isn't cheaper or more effective than private in the US.",1212078787

Though I agree with the idea that not having cool features doesn't make a language suck (though it can certainly make programming in that language less fun), the rest of his stuff is why we have so much terrible code out there.<p>If you just ""shut up and code"" you'll rarely get what you wanted as far as functionality goes.<p>Also highly complex code is usually a sign of a bad programmer, not a good one. Complex code is very rarely necessary to get the job done, and it leads to very high maintenance systems.<p>Good programmers take great pride in producing things that are simple, as is the case with most artists. The best photographs usually aren't the ones that have everything in them, but rather the ones that have exactly what the photographer needed to say what he/she wanted to say.<p>Not to place photography on a pedestal, IMO this applies to all of the arts.

And I've done it more often in the past, though for smaller numbers.  I haven't had a bad experience doing it myself.  A number of our customers are doing it regularly with phpList or poMMo.<p>There are a few things you have to get right (DNS including a PTR for your IP, SPF and now DKIM, RFC compliance in your server and configuration), but once that's done, bounce rate will be nearly as low as the quality of your list allows.  Hitting the spam filters isn't all that bad either--assuming your message isn't spammy on other counts.<p>One other thing to be wary of: Sending to the same domain many times in rapid succession.  Be sure you're not sending more than one or two messages at a time to Gmail or Yahoo or Hotmail (or any single server).  So, randomize the list, and sleep for a second or two between each send, or something, to insure that there are pauses.<p>Oh, and at least Google's spam filters are reputation-based (and probably many others are, as well).  The looser you play with the ""opt in"" requirement, the more likely you are to be flagged as spam by your recipients.  It only takes a few to get your future mailings dumped into the spam folder.  At that point your server itself is poisoned from sending to that destination for a while.  So, make sure your recipients actually want what you're sending them.",1212078629

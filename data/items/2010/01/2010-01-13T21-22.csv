An NDA is required to protect info from disclosure, even if we never use it (i.e. work together). A non-compete means our areas of business are too close and perhaps we should not be exchanging confidential information in the first place. However, an NDA with language that states you will not use confidential info except for the benefit of the person you received it from is perfectly reasonable.",1263419862

Over the past 10 years they are only slightly diminished but no less amazing.<p>I've been traveling to China annually for pretty much the last 6-7 years and lived there for an extended period of time a few years ago.  The changes have been dramatic in both urban and rural areas.  In fact I found change to be even more visible in the rural areas.  Literally over a year farm fields would be transformed to high-rises and cosmopolitan residential communities.<p>The changes in infrastructure/economic development has also fostered great changes/progress towards a more civil society, etc.<p>Even if we were just to compare 2000 vs 2010 the changes are great.  To say that there have been no major progress in 10 years and to suggest that South Korean and Japanese development in that same period of time has been greater than China's is patently absurd.

A lot of the natives (probably the majority) were farmers themselves. And a most of them were rather friendly towards the early colonists and eager to trade with them and intermingle. If the Europeans simply taught the natives their higher efficiency farming methods, there would not be a conflict for land either, because America has enough land to support much larger populations than were present at the time.<p>Of course some natives were hunter gatherers and they would have to change their lifestyles, so I am sure there would be some battles, but if the hunter gatherers had an option to assimilate, they would not fight to the death either, they would eventually see that there is no way out after losing a couple of battles. So there may be some war but there would not be genocide. As it happened, they only fought to the death because they knew there wasn't another option.",1263418963

1051216,comment,1049961,1050046,0,0,i2pi,,,"Um. How much does it cost the bank? Zero. Or very close to it. Unlike banks outside of North America, US banks earn well over 50% of their revenue from fees and charges.<p>The typical banking model of net interest margin (the amount earned by the difference in savings & loan rates) dominates revenue elsewhere. The American market, however, is so lacking in competition that they can get away with charging hidden fees and charges.<p>Sure, it helps if you check your balance. But do you read your full terms and conditions each time your bank changes them. I spent most of my summer reading the T&C's of every major bank account in America. You'd be very surprised by what they contain.<p>Here's a personal favourite of mine: most banks would retain the right to re-order your transactions in any 24 hour period before settlement so that withdrawals for large amount came before any smaller amounts, and then deposits were posted in reverse order. What this means is that if you were to start out the day with $100, then have a $2,000 check clear and post to your account, you could go out and make a purchase in the afternoon for $500 and _still_ get hit by an overdraft fee. And if in the morning you made a few $5 purchases, they would _also_ incur the $35 (median) overdraft fee, despite the fact that if the balance was updated in chronological order you would incur no such fee.<p>I say 'would' as this practice is being phased out. That said, overdraft fees, while expected to earn $40bn for banks in '09, are only about 7% of overall revenue. There are plenty of other tricks that banks have up their sleeve.<p>Falling back on the argument that banks are allowed to do whatever you agree to in your contract is intellectually and morally dishonest. No one reads their T&C's. Banks know this and use many invisible and often unavoidable fees to earn excessive revenue from unsuspecting consumers.<p>And even if you were to level the playing field in terms of fees and charges, banks are sluggish and don't grok what it means to have a good online experience. We are working on fixing this.<p>If you want to speak with us in more detail, track us down and we'd be happy to chat.",1263418471

The FDIC is concerned about two things right now. First off they are worried about 'innovative business models' as it was 'innovation' that led to much of the current crisis. Secondly, the FDIC is very concerned that the acquiring company will simply shutter the original branches and cause a dis-service to the local community.<p>Even if you were able to acquire a bank, you'd need to go through much of the FDIC and OCC (assuming it is a nationally chartered bank) approval process. This is typically a time consuming process. Prior to the crisis this would take 18 months to 2 years. Currently the FDIC is making this more difficult and de novo banks forecast a 3+ year approval process.<p>In addition to the time constraints to starting a de novo (brand new) bank, you need to have regulatory capital in advance of opening. Off the top of my head you need to have enough capital to cover your expected three year deposits. So unless you have $50m lying around, it will be tricky.<p>That all said, there are ways to do this.

Consider though that by very fact the conquistadors received funding from the crown, must in some way, shape, or form, have reflected prevailing attitudes at the time in Spain and within the Catholic church. After all, one of the goals of the expeditions was to ""Christianize"" the godless heathens, as well as ""find"" material wealth. So in this sense, yes, some of the attitudes at the time, e.g. the spread of Christendom by any (usually violent) means necessary, are ugly and bad.<p>> ""The real world is complicated, and all-or-nothing thinking is irrationally and unforgivably lazy.""<p>Yes, some idea require a certain nuanced approach to fully comprehend, others however, do not.

The Europeans had 10,000 of cultural and genetic adaptation to high density, agricultural based living.  The natives lived a fundamentally different way of life that required far less population density.  Like the Navi in Avatar, most natives would rather fight and die than give up their ancestral ways.  And even if they had wanted to assimilate, it's not clear it would have been possible.  While there was some peaceful co-existence on a small scale, as soon as the density grows the farms start encroaching on the hunting grounds and the conflict becomes unavoidable.",1263416450

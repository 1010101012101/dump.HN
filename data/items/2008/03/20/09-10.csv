141540,comment,141492,141492,0,0,david927,,,"I wish them luck.  In my humble opinion, they're making many mistakes.  Their core principles aren't abstract enough.  ""Golden Box"" is a technology not a principle -- and it isn't necessary to get where they want to go.  As long as they focus on ""small and self-describing"", they won't go anywhere.  Lisp is beautiful in this way, but that's irrelevant.  I heard they even pinned-up some code that Ian wrote.  Bad move -- no Golden Calves.  You have to be able to throw it all out every few months.  There are some other things I could say but won't.  I respect Alan Kay more than anyone in this industry.  So, again, good luck.",1206004814

The reality is that 80% of the world still uses IE, and anyone trying to make a living on the web should think long and hard before ignoring that fact.<p>Joel isn't arguing that IE8 should be or deserves to be the standard, he's simply arguing that like many things Microsoft puts out, there are too many people using it to ignore.",1206004605

141535,comment,141515,141515,0,0,Shooter,,,"I think a great name is very valuable and should be protected with a trademark if you can do so and you have the funds.  (If your company name sounds like a Teletubbie's name, don't bother.  Instead work on coming up with a better name.)  Trademarks can be very valuable IP and can give you a decent amount of leverage if used correctly.  I've secured startup funding on two occasions just based on the strength of the company names and the fact that I had trademarked them.  Trademarks are also something you can usually do yourself, whereas patents almost always require professional help. It's a cheap investment.<p>We used to always get a few international domains (.uk, .au, etc.), but we don't do it anymore unless we are actually establishing a physical presence in those countries.  It is otherwise a waste of time and money.  The .COM version is highly prized and will work for international customers just as well as a country-specific suffix.",1206003606

106857,comment,106696,106696,0,0,sarosh,,,"Having a good lawyer or law firm that you <i>trust</i> is fairly essential. They will be able to prepare your essential documents and steer you clear of landmines (especially the ones you know nothing about). If you are truly a cash strapped startup then a quick way to do this is to find the nearest law school (state or private), head to the library, and ask about the relevant area (IP, incorporation, etc.) and find the professor who teaches the subject.<p>This same principal applies for your financial adviser. Its better to head to your local MBA school and drop in to a professor who can guide you then try to fumble around yourself.<p>In sum, two essentials: lawyer + CFO<p>p.s. what is it that you are building?",1201708162

106846,comment,106827,106827,0,0,sosuke,,,"On the flip side, I can't stand building out a XHTML/CSS site from a designer that comes from a print background. No considerations from the design side are made for the web world. None of the front-end developers I work with would make the mistakes listed but these guys and gals think of their work like an art. To faithfully render the designers mockups into a document that can be rendered identically across browsers and platforms in the fastest way is their goal.<p>The points about free fonts and stock photography. Using system standard free fonts is good for several reasons including initial cost. The main reason I favor system standard fonts is being able to render headers and menus in text versus having to load up and image which is wasted bandwidth for most cases. Stock photography purchases are also tough to swallow for a developer but in a proper setting the developer for the site shouldn't worry about the cost of things because he isn't footing the bill! If it is a developers personal project, understand that he is a do-it-yourself kinda person and will want everything for inexpensive or free.<p>Sorry this article got me worked up a bit. I felt I fell into the developer (non-designer) category but I don't know anyone so full of themselves to make many of those mistakes. Can't we all just get along? ;)",1201706382

I like it when Mr. Nobody calls the founder of a huge company ""clueless"".  Obviously, Yang is a stopgap CEO after Semel.

The most important reason a user should have an internet-wide blacklist on JS as the default is because the default should <i>NOT</i> be to allow any website ever to run arbitrary scripts on a user&#x27;s machine.<p>That&#x27;s like always running as root while on a development server. No, wait - that&#x27;s like having random people from the street have root on your server for arbitrary amounts of time, and all you can do is watch. Principle of least privilege certainly applies to the web as well.<p>Let&#x27;s not even mention how an open and private web is hindered by orders of magnitude from Google analytics and Facebook like buttons tracking you across entirely different spectra of websites simply because the sites you&#x27;re visiting has them embedded.<p>---<p>EDIT: Can the downvoters please reply with constructive criticism.",1423468655

9020113,comment,9019291,9020045,0,0,crdoconnor,,,">In general, the thing that draws people to building a JS-driven site is because it allows faster responsiveness for users<p>The reality, however, when you create sites like banking websites is that it is more often slower.<p>Google maps is the exception, not the norm.<p>>a more versatile interface that behaves more like a application and less like a document. I think by now this much should be obvious. If the standard HTTP request/response approach resulted in the responsiveness in feedback we see with AJAX, then we wouldn&#x27;t have been having this discussion for the last 10 years.<p>We&#x27;ve had the NoSQL discussion for an equivalent duration. Ironically, the source of this discussion was the same in both cases - that because it worked well for Google&#x27;s specific requirements, it should be used everywhere. That proved to be an unfounded assumption.<p>>So in short, if a JS-oriented banking website results in a user being able to do their banking more quickly, this is a real benefit<p>Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t usually result in a faster website. The banking website I use that makes heavy use of javascript is actually slower than those that do not.<p>>You can argue it is not worth the tradeoff, but it&#x27;s a bit odd to first admit you don&#x27;t see the point and then go on to say it&#x27;s not worth it.<p>The point was fairly clear: unless you can make a significant speed gain (and more than you think can not), then there is no trade off. It is universally a bad idea.<p>>If a bank has 50k daily active users and it shaves 1-2 minutes off of their individual session times, you&#x27;re looking at saving approximately 50 days of time for people every day.<p>That&#x27;s the second time on this thread that you&#x27;ve pulled a number right out of your ass.<p>>Combine this with other potential benefits like users being able to get enough done in a single banking session to avoid a second visit later, or the user interface being less confusing since users can fall back on desktop metaphors<p>Then there are those AJAX websites that break the back button. Users LOVE that.",1423468293

With free-form comments that could range from a one-line comment to large paragraphs to explain one line of code, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a way to make sure they would look reasonable in all cases. (I could be wrong)<p>A good example of easy-to-read in-text notes (in my opinion) are those in Fred Hebert&#x27;s LYSE [1]. They could be sidenotes or footnotes, but instead they&#x27;re in-text, which makes them easier for me to read in a browser, regardless of screen size, but also pretty easy to skip over since they&#x27;re color-coded and in their own box.<p>I think it&#x27;s more of a medium difference than a book-typography-is-more-modern one.  When scrolling through a web page or code, I mostly find the single-column in-text notes/comments easier to use, though I see why some people might prefer sidenotes.<p>[1] <a href=""http://learnyousomeerlang.com/starting-out-for-real#bool-and-compare"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyousomeerlang.com/starting-out-for-real#bool-and...</a>",1423468076

If you don&#x27;t see the point, how can you make claims about if it&#x27;s a valuable thing to be doing? If a bank has 50k daily active users and it shaves 1-2 minutes off of their individual session times, you&#x27;re looking at saving approximately 50 days of time for people <i>every day</i>. And most banks probably have way more than 50k daily actives. Combine this with other potential benefits like users being able to get enough done in a single banking session to avoid a second visit later, or the user interface being less confusing since users can fall back on desktop metaphors, the amount of saved effort could become truly staggering, worth the additional risk and engineering time of developing a SPA-based solution.",1423466335

I&#x27;d just like to bring your attention back to the point that<p>&quot;What the application does and how it behaves is all that matters.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m hard pressed to find a rebuttal to this, if only for the reason that implementation is the goal. No one will ask you to write an application in Python, &quot;and who cares what it does&quot;. The very opposite is true - no one cares what it&#x27;s written in as long as it&#x27;s the necessary implementation.<p>From here I would like to address my &quot;point&quot; that tech stack and framework don&#x27;t matter. I think that we&#x27;re actually on the same page here save for some sloppy wording on my part. I concede that on a per-project basis framework and stack matter. They quite clearly do, and I agree with you.<p>I would still like to argue that they don&#x27;t matter as much as we like to think. To use the example you gave - PHP - depending on your purpose, your required implementation, PHP is still a powerful and useful tool. It&#x27;s easier to work with than many other technologies for certain kinds of solutions. At the same time, it might be a better idea to write a solution on Rails for any number of reasons. These are specific to each project. At the end of the day though, you can successfully implement any number of solutions on a great many different stacks with no great change to implementation. I can write an application and use either PHP or Rails for the backend, Angular or Backbone for the frontend framework if I have one, and for the end user there will be ultimately no difference. I can run a PostgreSQL or a MongoDB database and they won&#x27;t be able to tell the difference. If this is the case then, what makes a good application? It is the people writing the code, architecting, and meeting the challenges in ways that work with the chosen frameworks and technology stacks. It seems to me that the end result, then, is reached by people and not by stacks or frameworks.<p>Sorry for the long reply. No harm if you don&#x27;t reply to it.",1423466188

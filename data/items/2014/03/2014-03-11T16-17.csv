7380541,comment,7379821,7380439,0,0,saurik,,,"When playing against a random opponent, sometimes it will &quot;accidentally&quot; make the best possible move. In chess, this might be extremely unlikely, as there are so many possible moves: the probability that, of all the pieces on the board, with all of the positions it could have made, that it would stumble upon a move that devastates your position--especially considering that often multiple correct moves must be performed in specific sequence to take advantage of what &quot;should be&quot; a winning position--is vanishingly small.<p>Further: the potential for gain (trivial mate against a stupid opponent in a handful of moves) is great. If you are thereby playing for &quot;fastest win over time&quot;, taking advantage of random&#x27;s suboptimality seems sane. In 2048, the bottleneck on your score seems best approximated by how long you survive: pulling stunts won&#x27;t get you to 2048 all that faster as you need to have worked through enough tiles to arrive at that point: I&#x27;d imagine the difference would be at best a tiny fraction of the &quot;required&quot; moves.<p>Meanwhile, the computer has only a few possible moves, increasing the probability of doing something accidentally optimal. As you approach the end, needing over half the board just for unbuilt path up to 1024 and thereby not having as much scratch space, the probability of it hitting a problematic (even if not &quot;devastating&quot;, one that suddenly requires you to reorganize things to &quot;clean up the mess&quot;) move seems more more of a problem than when playing chess.<p>In summary: I just don&#x27;t think comparing this game to chess is leading to useful intuitions.",1394557171

7380535,comment,7379797,7379797,8,0,ideonexus,,,"I&#x27;m uncomfortable with the sweeping-generalizations of this comment from the article, but I do think there&#x27;s some insight to it concerning independent thinking and science. Science is a creative endeavor:<p>Steve Jackman said:<p>&quot;Foreigners have an image of the Japanese as very thorough, detail-oriented, and meticulous. However, my experience in Japan over more than a decade has been just the opposite of this. Things got so bad at my Japanese company that everytime I would check my Japanese subordinates’ work, for me it was never a matter of if I would find mistakes, but how many mistakes would I eventually end up finding. Many of these were due to pure sloppiness, carelessness, an inability to think independently, critically or to ask questions, a blind allegiance to protocol and heirarchy, and a fear of being perceived as a troublemaker or someone who is not a team player.<p>&quot;This helped me understand why Japanese companies place such importance on manuals, rules and doing things by the book, since the Japanese are usually very good at following rules that have been written down for them. This style may work well for manufacturing industries, but not for research, STEM fileds (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths), or in the knowledge and service industries of the future.&quot;",1394557127

Take &quot;rm&quot; as a trivial example - when I say `rm foo.txt`, I want the file to be gone. What if the file is already gone? Then it throws an error! You have to either wrap it in a test, which means you introduce a race condition, or use &quot;-f&quot; which disables other, more important, safeguards. An idempotent version of rm - `i_rm foo.txt` or `no_file_called! foo.txt` would would include that race-condition-avoiding logic internally, so you don&#x27;t have to reinvent it, and bail only if anything funny happened (permission errors, filesystem errors). I does <i>not</i> invoke a solver to try to get around edge cases (e.g., it won&#x27;t decide to remount the filesystem writeable so that it change an immutable fs...)<p>Puppet attempts to create idempotent actions to use as primitives, but unfortunately they&#x27;re written in a weird dialect of ruby and tend to rely on a bunch of Puppet internals in poor separation-of-concern ways (disclaimer: I used to be a Puppet developer) and I think that Chef has analogous problems.<p>Ansible seems to be on the right track. It&#x27;s still using Python scripts to wrap the non-idempotent unix primitives - but at least it&#x27;s clean, reusable code.<p>Are package managers idempotent the way they&#x27;re currently written? Yes, basically. But they have a solver, which means that when you say &quot;install this&quot; it might say &quot;of course, to do that, I have to <i>uninstall</i> a <i>bunch of stuff</i>&quot; which is dangerous. So Kožar&#x27;s proposal is somewhere in the right direction - since it seems like you wouldn&#x27;t have to ever (?) uninstall things, but it&#x27;s making some big changes to the unix filesystem to accomplish it, and then it&#x27;s not clear to me how you know which versions of what libs to link to and stuff like that. There&#x27;s probably smaller steps we could take today, when automating systems. Is there a &quot;don&#x27;t do anything I didn&#x27;t explicitly tell you to!&quot; flag for apt-get ?",1394555943

The de jure objection to this is that the Administration can fire and hire at will, and can affect these agencies with that power. The de facto reality, however, is that the President only has limited ability to affect these agencies, much more limited in power than we are taught in school.[1] Further, the oversight abilities of Congress have been negated in ways that are well demonstrated here.<p>I am no Obama fan, especially in this regard, but I do believe his Administration is the problem.

I&#x27;m not buying it from the words.<p>With typical torrent use, you have to wait the entire download time before you can watch anything because the pieces are randomly selected. But adding streaming just means you have to bias toward the early pieces just enough to have a decent buffer. After that, you can still be random.<p>The case of prime time seems to be better for this approach, not worse. People still won&#x27;t all start at the exact same time. The early arrivals will all replicate the early pieces, beefing up the ability of the swarm to get the pieces everybody wants.<p>I haven&#x27;t looked at the code, but it seems to me that as long as it&#x27;s flexible about the amount of time it takes to fill its initial buffer, and as long as it keeps serving after people are done watching (to compensate for the up/down pipe asymmetry), then the swarm would survive just fine.<p>Indeed, I think making swarm participation much easier and more appealing might increase the depth of resources around any given torrent, making results net better for popular files.",1394554927

He complied, constraining his P6 toolchain coding to pieces such as the STD grammar/parser.<p>* Late last year Larry said he planned to change that, with his main focus set to be optimizations. And in the last few weeks he has indeed begun landing a stream of commits to Rakudo and MoarVM. (So far his commits mostly relate to Unicode handling, which looks set to be a notable P6 strength, but there have been some significant optimizations too.)<p>* There is a de facto reference implementation: Rakudo/MoarVM.",1394554472

OLPC might have been one of those -- the interface was never as polished as Uber/Spotify, even though they certainly aimed at it being rather simple.<p>And here&#x27;s my main point: I am worried Project Gutenberg is exactly one of those projects that will disappear because they&#x27;re clunky in the eyes of the young.<p>The website is old-looking (a Wikimedia engine, likely) and it is not that easy (compared to shopping for apps on a phone) to search for the right book -- look for Emile Zola and you will have to look for many, many results, some of them being the same book but in a different language (and there is no sorting based on say your location).<p>Worst of all -- most consumer ebook devices are pushing their own bookstores, making it more difficult to load and read books from outside sources such as Gutenberg.<p>Loading up tons of free books to any kid&#x27;s &quot;device&quot; sounds like the first baby step to a Primer, and yet even the basic foundation of that -- Project Gutenberg -- is as clunky as OLPC (and lacks a lot of old books, too).",1394554448

7380107,comment,7379517,7379517,1,0,codylindley,,,"The concept of a “thick client”, “fat client”, or “rich client” application is not new wave thinking. Adobe flash applications poked at this problem for years. It’s adoption as a web application architecture might still be seeping into the enterprise mainstream but building an application in the frontend that talks to an interface/API is not exactly ground breaking. Hybrid web 2.0 applications have been doing this to some degree for years. Sprinkling AJAX or JSONP strategies into web pages and calling it a thick/fat/rich client is almost old hat. From here however, where are we headed?<p>Where are we headed from web 2.0 and how do we categories and refer to the evolution of thick client applications that can be popped up with ease by using static files and third party services from the frontend?<p>Popup frontend applications are typically completely driven by third party backend services (e.g. mailgun, firebase, userapp, stripe). Pragmatically speaking, a backend is not exactly absent, but instead the backend has become a plug and play service component to the architecture which provides an interface (be it a REST api or some special JS sugar kit) to commonly needed application functionality. In other words, applications typically require parts that do things like email communication, data storage, user management, and payments. As of late, all of this can be provided as a third party service and handled in the client using some form of a public interface/api. Because the frontend is doing the interfacing the application logic itself  (i.e. html, css, and js) can be served statically.<p>Now, given the static nature of the files sent to the client and the third party approach to backend services this new frontier is currently being labeled as “static”, “no-backend”, “un-hosted” or “backend-less” application development. I find these terms confusing and and to some degree outright misleading.<p>This new frontier is not about static files alone. The files themselve are very much dynamic in nature/function and are not unlike the notion of a dynamic web page of the past, but I suppose strictly speaking they are served statically. However, while literally served statically, their nature is still very much dynamic. Thus, the term “static apps” does not seem appropriate to me.<p>As for this idea of no, un, or less backend. Well, none of that is exactly true. It’s not no, un, or less backend, it’s simply a backend that is not custom built or maintained by the same developer(s) who construct the static application logic. This does not mean the backend is gone, it simply means that the backend is relegated to a foreign land (i.e. third party) and has become a service switch that frontend engineers can turn on and off and scale as needed.<p>But let’s not consider this new frontier a complete off the shelf backend black box either. That would be a mistake as well. To setup a service still requires some backend chops and in the future knowing how to configure the switches is still a requirement to get started.\nI believe this new frontier can best be described as a land of frontend applications that one can simply popup by standing on the shoulders of robust services providing simple and commonplace interfaces.<p>Is “Popup Frontend Applications” the correct term, well, I’m not sure. What do you think?",1394553988

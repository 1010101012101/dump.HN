You need to start somewhere!  Sure its expensive to get your hands on driving car hardware, but there are plenty of hard problems out there that need solving and can be done using opensource and your personal computer.<p>If you are able to get yourself through a really tough problem, you will come out better on the other side - even if it takes you years to solve.",1362239953
5309829,comment,5309086,5309594,3,0,alan_cx,,,"Yes, 99% agree. But a word for the BBC and its iPlayer. Well ahead of the game. I remember years ago chatting with some Americans who were literally gob smacked that we has such a thing, not only that, the bandwidth to make it generally usable. TV wise, the UK has been brilliant. So good that its <i>almost</i> not worth downloading UK TV shows at all. OK, if you want shows from pay channels you have to be paying, but I suppose that counts as fair enough. Not perfect, but, um, industry defensible, ish.<p>Movies and music are still a mess though.<p>Also, not so sure the technology is entirely responsible for the difficulties these businesses are having. I think it partly an excuse. One of the big things they have against them, is that our money now has more places for us to chose for it to go. There is a lot more to spend our money one, and many chose not to spend money on TV, movies and music. Especially when a huge opinion is that the quality had lowered to a lowest common denominator.<p>In the past they (TV, music, movies) had a monopoly over our spare cash. They could dictate. I think history will see the last 50 years as a weird anomaly where the media had a disproportionate amount of control over the market. Look at the 70's, no competition from out side the industry. Total control. Cartel like pricing. The whole period was a joke in favour of these industries. It work and they liked it.<p>Now, not only as you say the technology has over taken them, but there are now other things to spend money on. If they were to completely secure their medium, and we had no way round it, many would just do with out, still spending money on other things. Worse now in a recession as spare cash tightens up. Might even hurt them because the free advertising of illegal down loading would cease. For example, I might down load a movie, and tell others how great it was. I might never buy it, but some of my friends might. Well, I know that is true. Several movies I've torrented have been since bought on DVD or watch on a legit online paid for service as a result of me illegally seeing it and raving on about it to others. Heh, right now my son is paying to watch 24 online because I went on about how good it was.<p>What is appalling about the whole thing is the governments colluding with the dying dinosaurs to use the instrument of law to keep the rotting failed businesses in business. If the US, etc, were really capitalists they would let capitalism work, supply and demand, and allow these businesses if necessary to go bust. Then people would have to innovate and create something new to move on. But this is strangled while the deluded government and businesses struggle on by criminalising and terrorising people with heavy handed laws that ruin lives. Its a complete abuse of power and democracy, leaving capitalism limp and useless.<p>Oh. Too much. Sorry.... Hope no one has lapsed in to a coma. :)",1362239923

I love linux but frankly I know many people who can barely use a mac, and linux is beyond their technical capabilities without much learning.  So I'd currently guess that linux will end up with a higher percentage on steam stats than other stats.  Also, many people once choose windows solely to play games.

5309817,comment,5309086,5309731,6,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">The important question here is, are you likely to be prosecuted for such a dumb thing.<p>That is not the important question. The important question is whether people engaged in legitimate activity will modify their behavior in order to avoid the possibility of being prosecuted for such a dumb thing. Which has already happened. Ubuntu doesn't include DVD playback support. Nobody makes a DVD jukebox like what Real wanted to make when the courts shut them down. The amount of innovation that hasn't happened because nobody can sell it in Walmart without risking a lawsuit or criminal prosecution is unthinkable and we are all poorer for it.<p>The point of articles like this is to get more people behind doing something about it. There is no legitimate reason that circumventing DRM when there is no underlying act of infringement should be illegal. The entire concept of criminalizing circumvention is a failure and a farce, but criminalizing circumvention without infringement is (as you rightly point out) just plain ludicrous.

Well, up till college, we are taught to solve problems that are already solved, towards our PhD, we come across problems that haven't been solved, they are hard, but they are not the end of it, beyond that lies a sanctum, where you must find a problem and fix it. Thats what entrepreneurs do, it may sound easy, but do not be fooled by it, because being an entrepreneur it seems easy when you have found a problem and its solution, or as Steve Jobs said "" looking back, the dots connect but 20 years ago, looking forward, they did not""<p>Billions of people around the globe haven't even noticed many a problems, yet a handful of entrepreneurs did, wasn't that the first part of problem solving, and if you haven't probably noticed, you are here after all, so you might unconsciously know the answer lays somewhere around here.<p>So from my eyes, whether its programming or maths, the hardest problems that exist are the problems no one has noticed yet.<p>For your case, you might want to find a problem of programming, if you have programmed for that many years, you will surely run into one, that no one has noticed.

I'm not in the Bay area quite yet.. soon, and have never had a ""Satay"" (rural midwestern guy). They sound pretty good though.<p>Just one suggestion on the website that would take maybe an hour to fix. Your menu is a giant, low-quality PNG. I can barely read it, and zooming in just makes it worse. You either need to make it real HTML so I can zoom in and read it, or make it a PDF. Make sure your menu and website are VERY accessible via mobile -- if its hard to read on a nice desktop display, it's going to be next to impossible to read on Firefox mobile.<p>Also, your ""Catering Menu"" link goes nowhere. There is at least one image in your gallery that says ""this is a test"".<p>The pictures look fantastic!<p>Sales-wise, have you tried cold-calling start ups that are near you? Or have you attended any of the start up groups / meetings / events? Or outright asked to cater them? Spend a few hours on Monday cold-calling some local government offices, they don't cater often but something like satays might be unique enough to prompt them to try it out. For tech companies, reach out to their main account on Twitter. When they book you, tweet about it to help them get cross-promotion.<p>At this point, it sounds like you need clients more than branding -- reach out and grab some clients!<p>Do not annoy them. Make sure you keep track of who you call & when, who you reached (if anyone). Even if you only reach a support member or an engineer, if it sounds good they might mention it to feed their next hackathon.

Allow me to explain.<p>Referral links in book reviews are a problem because of the conflict of interest they create. If the author of the review chooses to put a referral link into it, they create a financial incentive to bias their own review in favour of the book. Rather than a means of helping people determine which books to buy, reviews become a hollow call to action with a conversion rate measured in referral dollars. A review with a referral link in it has absolutely no credibility.<p>On top of that, they call the very purpose of the review itself into question.

5309786,comment,5309086,5309253,3,0,rhplus,,,"The PBS geo-blocking is reasonable to understand. Video streaming can get <i>expensive</i> and international delivery almost certainly isn't in the foundation's stated mission at this point. Things also get complicated when you consider that PBS is not just one non-profit, but many ""member stations"", each operated as a separate non-profit. It's not their main objective navigate through the difficult task of making international streaming pay for itself (i.e. through correctly targeted ad partnerships or additional fund-raising). It's easier to just block it.<p>But back to the numbers: I'd estimate that PBS is paying around $0.05 per show to stream. I'm basing this on CDN costs in the range $0.10/GB - $0.20/GB, the size of 30 minute shows weighing in between 125MB and 250MB, plus storage and admin overheads. I might be wrong, but it looks like they're delivering their bits via CloudFront[1] and so those costs basically <i>double</i> for viewers outside of the US and Europe[2]. Even if it's not CloudFront, the basic cost structures stay the same. Why on earth would they want to serve content to users who mostly aren't giving them money and are costing twice as much to serve?<p>One last point: the link below are for Downtown Abbey, for which PBS certainly doesn't have international streaming rights.<p>[1] <a href=""http://video.pbs.org/videoPlayerInfo/2335534842"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.pbs.org/videoPlayerInfo/2335534842</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/</a>",1362239006

Simple as.<p>Now: 'Ways to help you understand the world' <--- Science/Math is one too. How?<p>A 'way of understanding the world' is a conditioning, a particular mode of thinking. Usually they require training. An ""objective"" observer watching a tribal ritual will find the whole ordeal it as meaningless as an ""objective"" observer who is watching scientists operating a lab. To understand this is scary for a ""man of science/math"" and it drove me to tears when it hit me from the sky.<p>As any consellation, the utility of science/math in predictive capabilities gives them a ""mere"" superiority (please bare with me, I reveal my inner fears here), but they cannot (IMHO) either be claimed more superior to the other because they both stand equally as conditionings. Those greats who discovered the truths of Science had great creative capability, and capacity for communication of profound ideas through elegant vehicles for the appreciation of mankind.<p>To illustrate: You cannot distil drawing to pure motor skill. This is an over-simplification, ""the arts deal in the particular, the individual and the personal while the sciences deal in the general, the universal and the collective"". Yet both describe the same phenomenon, one in abstract, the other in concrete, but both mere images compared with the current moment (now), which alone has the airs of Reality.<p>If I may play my final card: we should perhaps beware of the importance we place on these pursuits, because while they are the current paradigm, we certainly (IMHO) do not tap the  entire range of human potential.

I think here Apple wins hands down.  Apple's support of sproutcore (what became ember.js) has given it a great lead in the ability to do great web apps.  And apple's iCloud.com mail app is a good example of this.<p>Google ""Office"" vs. Apple Works - Apple wins again here in my opinion.  Numbers, Pages and Keynote are much better experiences than using google's products thru the web, simply because they are native and can take advantage of better APIs.   Both products provide ubiquitous storage of your data, so you can access your documents from your iPhone or your laptop.   I wouldn't say Google is ahead on services there, but before Apple released iCloud they were.<p>I really don't think Apple has done a bad job with online services. Certainly not when compared to google.  IF you look at iTunes Store-- which is actually an web service-- it is larger than anything google has, except maybe google search, depending on what metrics you use.<p>It's been stable and robust and usable with great UI since the store was first launched.  It's certainly sold more goods than google and made more profit than amazon, I bet.<p>Apple took the lead with web development way back when it was NeXT with webobjects which was the first modern web development framework.  They again have had the best product with sproutcore, dashcode, etc, though they've been a bit inconsistent.  Its only recently that google's really tried to produce web development tech, and while go is a good attempt at a language it is written by people who felt comfortable enforcing a religious design choice on every programmer!

Now picture that happening over a wide area with scores of ships.<p>My numbers might be off, but you could get total coverage and not really present a target for counter-attack. And maintain that coverage for months or years without having to worry about refueling, port calls, a logistics train, or personnel issues.<p>Lasers will change things in a big way, including creating completely new types of ships.",1362236939

5309655,comment,5308611,5308756,2,0,dhimes,,,"Rambling here, but there seems to be some similarity of  artists' plight and programmers' plight.<p>One of the ""problems"" with art is the low barrier to entry.  I've known a lot of people who were 'artists' who didn't really work at anything solid but rather spent some time emoting when the mood struck them then tried to capture that emotion in some sort of sketch or painting or poem.  (I also know artists who are working <i>very</i> hard, have their own modes of expression and are trying to keep things together to make a living.  Maybe I'll ramble back to them...)<p>One of the things that has happened to programming in 'recent' years (I'm old) is the barrier to entry for programming has dropped dramatically.  <i>For people who have an analytical bent</i>, it's pretty easy to set up a linux box with a bunch of programming tools (even Windows box I suppose), find some tutorials for building web page widgets, and start building stuff.<p>They can put themselves out on a freelancing site and make short money building crap software.  I've hired some freelancers, and every now and then come across one that thinks he is ""all that"" but he's really crappy.  (I had one recently that tried to upsell me to his servers.  Now get this:  I have my own, with ssh key access, and told me to send me his public key.  He sent me his PRIVATE key.  He sells hosting.  HOLY SHIT!)<p>There are a lot of people out there that don't know the difference between good and bad- and, for the moment, they don't care enough to ask the questions that allow them to distinguish.  They just want their damn blog up with the mouseover animation- or whatever.  And they'll pay for it.<p>At the higher end, programmers have more of a credentialing mechanism (degrees) which aren't perfect, and perhaps are archaic, but can nevertheless provide a first barrier.<p>As the person who wants the blog with the mouseover widget, I don't know shit about design or art.  If I'm buying art, how do I know what's good?  How do I know what's worth paying $300 for and what's worth paying $30000 for?<p>What's different about the people at the top of the food chain?  There's a lot of garbage in the system (does every artist still 'play guitar?') and it can make it a real challenge for the authentic practitioners to be visible without some help with the filtering process.",1362236767

The sciences are more important in people's minds because they provide for economic prosperity, an aftereffect of which is the flourishing of the arts.<p>It's not clear why the author seems to be optimistic. Maybe because the recent economic crisis has led the prices up in the elite art market? If anything, the examples of youtube, deviantart etc. prove that (the visual) arts are becoming increasingly a cheap commodity. So, from the standpoint of ""creating an impact"" the visual arts (and the performance arts) in particular seem  pretty doomed. How long can it be before we have screenplay-to-movie generators?

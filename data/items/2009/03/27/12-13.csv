This post is about a lot more than online writing. It's also about startups and hacking and just about anything else where there is a tension between expressing yourself and making a fast buck. The author's experience <i>happens to be</i> with writing, but there's a deeper truth here that could be lost if a reader skips the article because their interest lies in writing software rather than in writing words.",1238158565

He's addressing a real problem with an audience that something like this would be a fantastic boon for. Going beyond that would make it too general and would change the entire way it's marketed and approached.<p>I think keeping it only for LDS missionaries and MAYBE expanding it at some point beyond that to other youth missionaries abroad would be as far as it ought to go.<p>Being the ""go-to"" site for a particular segment is a winning formula here, not trying to be an ""everyman"" site to an audience that doesn't have a compelling reason to adopt something like this, whereas, the LDS missionary target audience doesn't have an alternative and it's rare that anyone would think to target them, so that helps a lot in this case.",1238158330

Does that number pass the smell test to you?<p>Wiki reports that our ~45,000 mile interstate highway system cost about 425 billion, or a hair under $10 million a mile, in 2006 dollars.  That's under a twentieth of what the LA transit folks are quoting.

First I thought how can this possibly work, I mean having two players playing at different time periods at the same time sounds iffy... but it looks like they might actually pull it off.<p>Thats pretty cool since time progresses, just in modifiable ways.

The last company I worked for didn't have much of a customer focus while my current company is truly obsessed with the value we deliver to the end customer.<p>Needless to say the earlier company has gone under while the current company has been going from strength to strength.<p>I'm not to clear on the point of ""frugality"" though. My current company does spend a lot on what could be considered trivial stuff to make us comfortable and it makes for a rewarding working environment.

534956,comment,532394,533365,0,0,pingswept,,,"I can't claim to have done a worldwide survey of gas and electricity prices, but my 4x number is from a direct calculation off of my own utility bills. I did the calculation about 2 years ago, but both costs have remained relatively constant (within 25%, say?) where I live in Boston since then. Additionally, Massachusetts electric prices are around 2x the national average (~$0.20/kWh rather than ~$0.10/kWh).<p>But maybe I'm a statistical anomaly. I'd be interested to see broader evidence if you've got it.<p>As mentioned in another reply to your comment, it could be that people are getting some savings by using heat pumps rather than resistive heaters. For temperatures near room temperature, heat pumps have a coefficient of performance as high as 3 or 4, but as it gets colder, it approaches 1. In a warm place like California, you might beat an inefficient old gas furnace with an electric heat pump.",1238156137
534955,comment,534903,534903,0,0,petercooper,,,"Separate to how useful this is, this is an awesome marketing technique that others should look into. That is, distributing a desktop app that's really just a front-end for what your Web app already does.<p>I've noticed it in myself (and I'm sure it applies to others) that I sense more ""value"" in downloading a ""free app"" versus using a free Web service. I was familiar with Litmus's services before, but I hadn't really bothered to give it a go until this. This desktop app makes it convenient (even though you have to use the Web to setup an account!) and it ""feels"" better somehow. If you have a Web app, think about whether a similar tactic could work for you (I've seen a similar thing happening with free iPhone apps promoting Web apps).",1238156030

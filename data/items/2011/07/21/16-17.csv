2790248,comment,2789709,2790127,19,0,_delirium,,,"True, but JSTOR is <i>supposed</i> to be a non-profit initiative in the service of scholarship, not a revenue-maximizing corporation. It's largely funded by taxpayer money. I agree they need funding to continue their work, and some of that comes from building up an internal revenue stream so they aren't completely dependent on the winds of year-to-year grants. But I've been disappointed overall by their lack of any commitment to make more things publicly available, given their charitable mission.<p>When JSTOR was first getting off the ground 15 years ago, many of us had higher hopes for the organization's direction, that it'd eventually be a mixture of subscription-only access for recent non-open-access journals, and free-to-anyone digitization of old, public-domain materials, like a large-scale version of Project Perseus. But nobody at JSTOR really pushed the 2nd part; they digitized old documents, but kept them all subscription-only, and never even developed plans (despite occasional agitation) for individuals to buy subscription access for any sort of reasonable price. They seem to have developed a bit of an unhealthy attachment to ""owning"" the JSTOR archive as their valuable crown jewel, despite officially just being custodians of it on behalf of the academic community.",1311267496

An amusing story: it was also one of the only companies to survive the original Morris worm unscathed, owing to deliberate use of obscure Japanese computers for WRI's gateway.<p>While I can't talk about unannounced technologies, I can say that HTML5 plays a pretty crucial role in our future technologies.

Also, the ""table can be used to emulate any structure"" piece means that every library and developer does OO and modules just a little bit differently, harming reuse across code bases.<p>There are a couple of syntax decisions (default globals, no ++ or --, indexes start at 1) that might cause negative reactions, but I'd put the lack of libraries and frameworks above that.<p>Lua is still awesome for simplicity, easy C binding, and performance, but deciding to build a new project in Lua requires a significant investment in just getting the base libraries put together.",1311267062

During the Cold War there were geopolitical military implications to building launch vehicles, and there was a huge brain drain (or brain sink if you like) of aerospace talent into military projects.<p>In the 1990s there was a very substantial boom in ""new space"" companies (orbital launch startups). A lot of that growth was fueled by the growing venture capital from the dot-com boom, however in many ways this was a very flawed boom that did more to hurt new space than help it. For one, much of it was based on a then emerging launch market for low-orbit comsat constellations such as Iridium, Globalstar, and Teledesic (which, of course, were in turn vastly fueled by the tech boom).<p>More importantly though the heavy influence of VC firms in providing investment funding for many new space companies twisted the industry in weird ways. The way VC works in tech based startups is often to seek out highly disruptive companies that are both high risk but that have a high chance of an enormous return if they succeed. This doesn't work as well with companies founded on physical engineering and it didn't help much for launch vehicle development. A lot of the early new space companies were founded on highly innovative and unconventional launch vehicle designs (hybrid jet/rocket planes, rocket helicopters, RLV SSTOs, etc.) which were at best several generations ahead of the current state of the art (and at worst highly impractical or unworkable). When the dot-com bubble burst the comsat constellation companies did as well, bringing down many new space startups with them.<p>However, out of those ashes a new generation of launch startups grew. These new startups didn't have the luxury of fantastical potential revenue streams from a comsat boom, they had to build their businesses on hard-nosed accounting and either more proven or more likely revenue sources such as traditional launch business (still a very big market) or space tourism. This spurred companies to be more practical in their engineering choices, to use iterative development practices, and to spend more of their efforts in competing with traditional launch providers. In combination with the X-Prize (which had been created in 1996, in the midst of the first generation of the new space boom) this helped create the current crop of space startups we know and love today. Companies like SpaceX who built a very traditional expendable rocket but did so using a competitive spirit in terms of expense and complexity not seen with most of the launch vehicles built via multi-billion dollar cost-plus government contracts. Companies like XCOR and Virgin Galactic/Scaled who are paving the way in sub-orbital space tourism with very elegant and simplified reusable rocket ships designed for simplicity and robustness of operations. Companies like Blue Origin who took up an enormously promising reusable launch vehicle design that the government abandoned (Delta Clipper), or Bigelow who took up an enormously promising space station design also abandoned by the government (TransHab). Companies like Masten and Armadillo showing that you don't have to be a billion dollar aerospace megacorp to do good work or blaze new trails in rocketry.<p>Despite a late and rocky start, the startup/barnstormer phase of manned and unmanned rocketry has finally begun in earnest. This phase propelled the design of the airplane from experimental and impractical craft like the Wright flyer to advance within 2 decades to the industrial, commercial, and military workhorses made of metal, able to carry a dozen passengers, and fly across or between continents that were built by the dozens or hundreds in the 1910s and '20s. And then a decade after that to craft like the DC-3 and the Spitfire. Launch vehicle development may not advance at quite that pace but it is nevertheless an enormously exciting time filled with a great deal of promise for anyone interested in spaceflight.",1311266819

If the act of inventing something is so important that we must give special rights to someone who invents, then we should also be looking at the quality of independent inventino.  And note that such independent invention happens all the time.  Look up the Bill Maher/The Onion ""Afterbirther"" saga.  Who invented the telephone?  Who invented the telgraph?  Who invented radio?  Who invented ""the computer""?  All cases where there's a legitimate claim to independent invention.

Do we make those decisions based on Natural Law? How about on the teachings of Mohammed? Jesus? etc.<p>Everything every human does is solely their reaction to their perception. It is as possible to misperceive the law itself as it is to differ on ethical reality; this is irrelevant to the reasoning of any individual. The law is a fluid entity, created by humans, and it is obviously incomplete as evidenced by the fact that we keep modifying it. Furthermore, <i>some</i> notion of ethics has to exist in order to create any law at all.<p>There is a large body of work in the field of ethics, and it is not really unreasonable for most people to try to understand it. While many philosophers disagree on particulars or even the entire foundation, there are many common elements in the philosophy of people as different as Kant and Nietzsche.<p>So yes, you have to react to <i>what you consider</i> to be a just law, just as you have to react to what you consider to be <i>the</i> law -- how many people do you know who actually know the law? In practice, this does not usually lead to much difficulty, if all of the participants agree to use at least a little logic.<p>The best analogy I can come up with is language -- everyone speaks their own version of language (even when everyone is speaking the ""same language), and if the rules are codified anywhere it is inevitably a tiny subset of the language that is actually used.

Combine that with something like the approach taken in Stoned Bootkit and you have a viable option for persisting malware across reinstalls.<p>In traditional PCs, BIOS reflash does not require any special signing key, or suchlike, and its trivial in a very small amount of code to splice an option ROM (code that executes automatically during power-on) into the BIOS of the running machine, and reflash it (slightly harder to do reliably). As far as I know current generation Macbooks don't perform any kind of signature check either.<p>Unlike with traditional PCs, Apple has a relatively small number of hardware revisions, making this kind of attack even easier to implement.",1311264592

The 'internet privacy' movement would be better served if the people who supported it differentiated themselves from the people who are just fucking around. I think a lot of them realize this.<p>The question ""why don't they"" has its answer in the dark catacombs of the human psyche. LulzSec and Anonymous draw a lot of their support, i.e. membership, from teenagers who want to feel like the antihero of one of today's popular bildungsroman-turned-polemic, y'know, <i>V for Vendetta</i>, or <i>The Matrix</i>, <i>Avatar</i>, etc. Being somewhat evil is cool, and Anonymous needs to look cool for people to want to be part of it. I'm sure the aforementioned Black Panthers lived on this for a while as well.<p>Some people <i>did</i> try to break the moral section of the movement away from the lunatic fringe; it was called Enturbulation and later WhyWeProtest, and they went after Scientology and later ACTA. Ultimately, though, WhyWeProtest slowly became irrelevant, because without a steady stream of angry people and plenty of press coverage their membership was decimated by the attrition of boredom and disillusionment. It's still around at <a href=""http://whyweprotest.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whyweprotest.net/</a> but unlike Anonymous you've never heard of them.<p>I support the EFF and Wikileaks much more readily than I support Anonymous, but at the same time I figure no social change movement has succeeded without a lunatic fringe -- there were plenty of violent people fighting for India's independence, the breakup of the Soviet Union started with a coup, there were multiple violent civil rights activists in the '60s, etc.",1311264256

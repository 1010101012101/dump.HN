347026,comment,345148,345984,0,0,lsc,,,"finding good people is hard, very hard.   Finding good people for below market wages is even harder.  It's possible, though.    It is much easier if you have the skill set you are looking for.  I bet that if you just hire blind and fire the people who don't work out, you will end up paying for a lot of unproductive hours.<p>It also adds a sense of urgency.  The thing is, once these good people working for below market wages get some good experience (working for you)  they will get jobs that pay market rates.  This has happened to me many times.   Expect and understand this.  Don't feel betrayed because someone with little or no equity abandons you for several times as much money.  Be honest, you would do the same. Give good references.  The best resource I've found for finding people who are both skilled and poor is other people who are skilled and poor.<p>I'd actually like some advice on how to handle equity in this case.  I've always done handshake kind of deals, which is asking for trouble if you become successful.  If the company does succeed, it seems fair to me to give some equity to the people who were working for below market wages.  (now, personally, I still think I should have more equity, because I was both the investor and one of the workers.)",1225245225

After all, when was the last time you opened a WordPerfect file or tried to read an 8-inch floppy disk?</i><p>Here comes the difference: I still have all of the data that was important from my first commodore 64. I literally have papers I wrote when I was a 5th grader. I can't read the c64 disks now of course but I copied them. From tape to 5 1/4, from low density to high, from c64 to amiga from high desnsity to 3.5, from amiga to pc, from 3.5 to zip, from zip to cd, and now to dvd. My parents lost nearly all of their records and photos in a fire in the mid 80s.<p>There is no ""digital dark ages"" because <i>you can copy it</i>. Easily. With no degradation. Yes, NASA lost some data from the viking landing. They learned the same hard lesson as the rest of us. Have backups.<p>Digital media has its faults but then so do Libraries at Alexandria.

<i>Shut off the print edition right now. You’ve got to play offense. You’ve got to do what Intel did in ’85 when it was getting killed by the Japanese in memory chips, which was its dominant business. And it famously killed the business--shut it off and focused on its much smaller business, microprocessors, because that was going to be the market of the future. And the minute Intel got out of playing defense and into playing offense, its future was secure. The newspaper companies have to do exactly the same thing.</i><p><i>The financial markets have discounted forward to the terminal conclusion for newspapers, which is basically bankruptcy. So at this point, if you’re one of these major newspapers and you shut off the printing press, your stock price would probably go up, despite the fact that you would lose 90 percent of your revenue. Then you play offense. And guess what? You’re an internet company.</i>",1225244003
347010,comment,346072,346072,0,0,lsc,,,"sales is important<p>But it's not everything.  There are other aspects of marketing that hackers are usually pretty good at (for instance, giving the impression that your company is honest and hires smart, competent people.)<p>Many companies skip the ""buy a suit, meet the client, buy them expensive dinners"" kind of sales.  Selling to consumers is much easier (well, for me)  you still have to market your company (like I said, can be as simple as giving the impression you are smart, competent and honest, depending on your target market.)  but the actual sales consists of posting the prices and setting up an automated system to take money.  No fast-talking is required.<p>Some people say you need sales skills to attract investors and partners.   Personally, I wouldn't take an investment from someone I wouldn't want as a partner, because they will act as a partner.  And I don't want a partner who is willing to give more money to a smooth talking salesguy than to a smart, honest hacker.<p>Granted, I do want a good salesperson on my team, but I don't want to put anyone who is vulnerable to sales anywhere they can make decisions that effect my company.  It is critical that small companies buy products and solutions that provide the best value, not products or solutions that are sold by the best salesperson.<p>My current plan is to get the technical side of my house in order (and I have no trouble selling to technical consumers, so far I haven't had any trouble selling faster than I can put up new capacity)  and get a customer base under me.   After that,  it should not be difficult to get a sales person to do corporate sales or the like, if I choose to go that direction.",1225243799

347001,comment,346797,346881,0,0,bigthboy,,,"I have to agree with you, when it comes down to the internet, its all about the ease of distributing information about whats happening RIGHT NOW.  Take most of the technology blogs, and even HN for example.  A great portion of what's on here or coming through the blogs is an overview or look at whats happening right now,  today, or information about what somebody did TODAY.  I also use these sources everyday as a primary source of what's going on.  However, when I want a full fledged story about not only what is happened but what has happened and why it happened I tend to go to other sources, the Wall Street Journal for example.<p>However, what you need to notice is that even the more complex periodicals are also moving online.  Newsweek, the WSJ itself, the New York Times, and so on and so forth.  I think it truly is just a matter of time before even these move to a totally online system.

You will get a good tutorial-based introduction to Objective C, Xcode/Interface Builder and the design patterns used to build both OSX and iPhone apps.  (iPhone is not mentioned in the book at all but the general patterns are the same.)<p>Be sure to understand the retain/release memory model as the garbage collector is not avail. on the iPhone.<p>With the background you gain from Hillegass you'll find it very easy to pick up the differences between OSX development (which uses AppKit) and the iPhone development (which uses UIKit).  There is a lot of good information found at the iPhone Dev. Program's website which bridges the gap.<p>The tutorial approach is always a little frustrating to me personally as often details are glossed over and the topics are not covered systematically but if you supplement the tutorial with the information provided by Apple you can resolve all the little annoyances as they come up.<p>Finally I recommend watching the videos Apple's prepared about iPhone development.<p>Good luck and have fun!",1225242712

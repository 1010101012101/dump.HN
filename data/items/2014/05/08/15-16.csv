Udemy needs to either offer more value to earn their cut, or optimize so they can afford to take less.</i><p>Your comment <i>might</i> be even remotely true if udemy was a not-for-profit company but that&#x27;s not the case. The goal of a company isn&#x27;t to have a net-zero sum at the end of the year (no profit). How much did udemy spend on advertising in the past years? Because the result of that advertising is what the OP is going to &quot;cash in&quot; on with his unbelievably high 50% revenue cut. How many conferences did udemy go to as a sponsor/have-a-booth? How many training sessions did they send their employees to so that their website + backend would be amazing fast and available?<p>Go to Microsoft Virtual Academy, or to Cisco, or to Oracle/etc, and ask them how much you will get paid if they do the same thing as udemy is doing. Go to O&#x27;Reilly and ask them, or Lynda.com, etc. How much will Packt pay you to write a book?<p>Complaining about a 50% revenue share is like complaining about a $49 airplane ticket from NY to Paris. First, you&#x27;re talking about a small group who need to or have ever flown from NY to Paris, and second your price point is likely 100% lower than the lowest fare anyone else has ever paid. So that leaves one solution: start your own airline and DIY (which is, in effect, what it appears the OP did).",1399564482

7715937,comment,7714403,7715104,2,0,ryanjshaw,,,"> are you going to stay on that version for the lifespan of the system? Likely not.<p>Not sure why you say that -- if it works, it works. I&#x27;ve just spent the last year working on a multi-million dollar project budget building a new system on a SQL Server 2005 cluster. Why? Because there was no need to budget for new hardware. (SQL Server 2008 R2 would have been a big step up, after that not really worthwhile upgrades, in our case.)<p>> For example, if my Azure costs are $10K a month, from that cost is likely $2K-$3K the Microsoft tax. Keep scaling your VMs and servers and that margin starts to look a bit less palatable.<p>Let&#x27;s say my hosting costs are 10k p.m, 120k p.a. and represent 15% of revenue (this is just how my business works - if I need that much SQL power I&#x27;m doing a hell of a lot of business). 120/0.15 = 800k in revenue.  Keeping things really simple, let&#x27;s say my gross margin is 50% and corp tax is 20%.  That leaves the business with a nice 320k profit.  Sure I don&#x27;t like spending 4.5% of my revenue on MS licensing, but at this point I can quit my job and port over to Postgresql (or more likely pay somebody else to). The point is that nobody wants to give away 4.5% but if it&#x27;s the line between success and failure then you probably have bigger issues with your business model/environment.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - for my current side project I&#x27;d love to use Postgresql as the backend and .NET for the rest but the problem with Postgresql is two-fold and really specific to <i>me</i>:<p>1.  I&#x27;d spend a lot of my time learning a new set of tools for zero benefit when time is my most expensive resource right now. I&#x27;m very familiar with T-SQL and the MSSQL platform (even simple things like having MERGE available has saved me lots of time given my problem domain, nevermind the ability to reuse a lot of code I&#x27;ve written and optimised over the past 10 years and knowledge of various issues and errors I will encounter). Porting in 3 years will be easier because we&#x27;ll have a working system to port from, and the risk to the project will be less because we aren&#x27;t doing two things at once (learn a new platform + solve a new problem -- only the later is going to <i>make</i> me money).<p>2.  I plan on using some of the MS BI tools for the first time as part of this project -- this represents quite valuable experience to have as a .NET developer/solution designer;  if I go the Postgresql route I will spend a lot of time exploring and evaluating open source options with zero benefit to my day job career progression over the next 3 years - I don&#x27;t have the luxury of neglecting my day job while I work on side projects, so I need to be careful I don&#x27;t lose value",1399564298

There&#x27;s a lot of explicit reading from and writing to mutable storage.

7715848,comment,7715025,7715025,14,0,vinkelhake,,,"I wrote a simple code search tool a number of years ago that had the ability to run arbitrary regex queries on a codebase, much like a recursive grep. I was working on a medium sized codebase and our primary platform was Windows. The problem with grep was that opening and scanning lots of small files apparently wasn&#x27;t something that Windows was optimized for. If the file cache was cold, a simple search could turn into minutes of waiting.<p>My approach was to, essentially, concatenate all files into a single blob. The search tool would then let the regex loose on the contents of that single file. I had a simple index on the side to map byte positions to filenames. To get a line number from the position I would simply count the number of newlines from the start of the file to the regex match position.<p>Add some smarts to avoid duplicating work, compression and multithreading and I had a tool that could find all lines that contained &quot;int(8|16|32|64)_t&quot; in the Linux kernel source in a third of a second. This was about 20 times faster than grep (with a hot file cache).<p>It was a simple solution that scaled well enough to handle the codebases I was working on at the time without problems.

But texts messages are somewhat secret and are often already stored in each of Alice and Bob&#x27;s phones. My assertion is these secrets authenticate Alice to Bob and Bob to Alice.<p>I mean currently it&#x27;s easy to reverse a hash because there aren&#x27;t many phone numbers (that was your point, wasn&#x27;t it?). If you query WhisperSystems (WS) by hash(sender_number + recipient_number + date_sent + text_message), then the hash is much harder to reverse for any long text message. Alice and Bob can both compute the hash and discover whether the other has TextSecure because only they can query this hash to WS. Similarly, they can authenticate each other and exchange keys because only they know their past message history.<p>Obviously, you wouldn&#x27;t use text history alone because someone may have been eavesdropping.

7715787,comment,7709850,7713816,0,0,diogenescynic,,,"1. An awful lot of tech workers make under $40k, even under $30k. The average H-1B salary is roughly $70,000. There&#x27;s a smaller percent at the top-end that skew the average up. The vast majority of the H-1Bs I saw were making $50,000-$65,000.<p>I think you misunderstand the process. First, the DOL sets the prevailing wages, but the employers choose what location, title, and experience level to apply under. Check this out: <a href=""http://flcdatacenter.com/CaseH1B.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flcdatacenter.com/CaseH1B.aspx</a>\nPlay around with it and see what you find.<p>Now, say you&#x27;re a company and you have multiple locations. You apply for the employee at the cheapest location, then pick a title that will get a lower prevailing wage, and say they are entry level when really they have 5 years of experience. So the prevailing wage determination is skewed. This is what I mean about telling a white lie. Anything that is available to companies that has a monetary reward for telling &quot;white lies&quot; to the government and depends on the companies &quot;being honest&quot; let alone understanding or agreeing with the overarching intent of the legislation -- is going to have the absolute shit abused out of it eventually.<p>If a Software Engineer gets a higher prevailing wage than a Software Developer (or vice versa) according to the DOL. Which title do you think the employer will pick to apply under?<p>2. I&#x27;ve seen multiple cases filed for L-1s around $15,000 and many more for around $25,000-$28,000. The L-1s get around the prevailing wage requirements by companies providing corporate housing and ammenities and meals at work. I worked on thousands of cases, so I am going to believe my sample size is more representative than your anecdotal experience.<p>3. This is an intellectually dishonest argument. Trading goods is not the same thing as employment. Stop trying to conflate them. And even still, following your argument Americans are still &#x27;employing&#x27; millions in India via imported goods. It&#x27;s still completely one-sided.<p>4. I disagree, I don&#x27;t think India and China should get preferential treatment for having a larger population. That&#x27;s ridiculous.<p>5. Again, I&#x27;ve seen this happen many times. The bitter truth H-1s appeal to employers because employers see them as exploitable, cheaper, and more ignorant of local labour customs and laws.",1399562929

You just treat them as anonymous values with particular operations, instead of getting stuck on &quot;but if we were in this other system that we&#x27;re not in, this would violate an axiom!&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not quite that simple. We&#x27;ve built up entire codes of ethics and law and branches of mathematics with practical applications like computing that rely utterly on these axioms. These are things used in the real world, they don&#x27;t just live in the realm of ideas. These systems don&#x27;t tolerate more than two values of truth. Even &quot;Western&quot; religion, from Judaism to Christianity to Islam is intimately concerned with the external world where things are concrete and ambiguity is not to be tolerated. Big-C Catholicism itself considers the Church to be the only institution capable of determining Truth, what it calls dogma. We&#x27;re very much handcuffed to using two values of truth here in this side of the world.<p>Buddhism is heavily oriented on the experience of the individual, individuals are free to use whatever sort of logic they want to make decisions. So it can experiment with ideas that are neither true nor false. But you can&#x27;t build a computer with it, at some level it all is resolved on individual components which are either on or off. We don&#x27;t even know yet if quantum computers which break the binary hegemony offer any real advantage.<p>But being able to integrate other kinds of logic might make entirely new approaches to, say, law, possible. It&#x27;s not enough to be able to imagine an alternative system, it&#x27;s in making it consistent. I personally am very excited about this.",1399562854

After feedback and testing, I made it so that the radius shrank as more people were online. So, if 1 person was on the site the radius was non-existent - it&#x27;d show the next few people regardless of location. As enough people opened the website, the radius would begin to shrink based on your own location to include at least 1 other person as close to you as possible, down to a minimum of like 20 miles. This way, if 10 people were online in San Francisco, but I was building the thing in Dallas, then I could at least join in the discussion in San Francisco until more people in Dallas joined in.<p>Looking back, to call my old thing a start-up in that post was hilarious. I also learned that my concept, being real-time location-based ephemeral anonymous chat (buzzwords jeez), has a severe chicken and egg problem. It&#x27;s damn near impossible to reach critical mass for long enough for the chat radiuses to create any opportunity for local discussion. I also learned that it really needed to be a native mobile app, instead of a website. Only tech savvy people really knew what was going on, in regards to enabling location services in browsers.<p>In the end, I had wished I just made some sort of non-realtime location-based tagging service, instead. Instead of real-time chat, just have location-based notes that you can leave somewhere in a very small precise proximity. That way there&#x27;s no need for a critical mass of users all at the same time.<p>Edit: it looks like by the time I posted it to HN even, I had began changing to the non-real-time version. it originally was purely real-time chat. the code is on github: <a href=""https://github.com/ryancole/geohello.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ryancole/geohello.com</a>",1399562661

But that doesn&#x27;t mean some extremely logical and compelling argument that I can&#x27;t imagine now couldn&#x27;t possibly make me see things in some entirely new, transformative light.<p>If anyone would be discussing that Dennet overview with me after I&#x27;ve read it, please say so...",1399562347

For as long as I can remember, I have been tall & skinny with an extremely narrow waist, and so pretty much every shirt or pair of slacks that I have ever owned have fit me poorly. To make matters worse, I decided to try online shopping a few years ago, only to realize that I was spending even more time returning clothes because they were the wrong size or fit.<p>While growing up, my best friend and I have always shared the same exact height, weight and body type and so we&#x27;ve always been able to share our wardrobes and advice with each other. It then came to me last year that this act of sharing was something people all over the world could truly benefit from.<p>So we slowly started building our website, www.fitbay.com, with the ultimate goal of building a community that would help everyone with discovering all the brands and products in the world in the right size & fit. Basically, you plug in your height, weight and body type and we’re able to instantly show you clothes that fit you based on the recommendations people with your exact measurements have made.<p>To get the initial recommendations we needed, I organized about 3-4 coffee meetings, inside & outside of work each and every day, asking friends, family, co-workers, acquaintances (and people on Reddit) to share with us their height, weight, and sizes they wear in their favorite brands. In doing so, we were able to, quite early, create the sensation of a “personalized store created just for you where everything fits” and a community of people who share the same fit-related issues.<p>In just 5 months we’ve now grown from just 50 to over 10,000 unique profiles on Fitbay having shared a total of 60,000+ unique product recommendations.<p>Help us out by visiting the site www.fitbay.com and sharing your thoughts here, and please do let us know if you have any ideas or feedback. Keep in mind that the community is still invite-only, but if you sign up using the link above I’ll do my best to make sure you get access within 24 hours.",1399561587

Streaming off disk can be pretty fast. LZ4 compression is fast enough to give us another big boost without turning CPU into a bottleneck. But the big enabler will be spreading data across disks, so that in principle we can use every spindle we own in service of every nontrivial query. The fact that server logs have a very high write-to-read ratio really helps us out here.<p>Today, we&#x27;re keeping everything on SSD -- twice, in fact, to maintain a hot spare for each server. SSD prices have fallen to the point where, even renting from Amazon, we can make the cost model work; and SSD is a great crutch as we tune our storage layer. But spinning disk will be a lot cheaper.<p>As for Java: we&#x27;ve been pretty surprised ourselves. Going in, we expected to need a lot more &quot;native&quot; (C) code. As it turned out, currently the only non-Java code we&#x27;re using is the LZ4 library, and even there we only recently moved to the non-Java implementation. We do soon expect to move a few more bits of code to C, such as the core text-search loop. But based on the performance we&#x27;ve been getting in pure Java, we don&#x27;t anticipate any need to move more than a fraction of 1% of our overall code base.<p>We do have some code that lives in a sort of middle ground -- Java code written like it was in C. Our database buffers live in a set of 2GB byte arrays, soon to be replaced by native memory blocks. We do our own (very simple) memory allocation within that, and use a sprinkling of Unsafe operations to access it. This gets us closer to C performance (not all the way there), without any of the hassles of bridging across languages. This part is still well under 1% of our overall codebase.",1399561583

While we can maybe say that Buddhism came up with some similar-looking stuff, there&#x27;s no causal link, and the philosophical systems are not working within the same paradigm. Like seeing a human face on the surface of Mars, this is an example of coincidence more than any deep connection.<p>Philosophies have been swapping ideas for thousands of years and it shows.  Take a look at thinkers like Plotinus for example.  He lived in Alexandria back when it was a multicultural metropolis hosting people from across the known world.  His philosophy uses ideas and language you would expect to find in eastern traditions.  Thanks to his extensive influence you will also find this jargon in western philosophy, christianity, islam, etc...  This might not seem relevant to you.  But if you know the historical connections between neo-platonism and philosophy of math it might.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotinus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotinus</a>",1399561514

It&#x27;s a pity that Qt&#x27;s foundation remains a fundamentally memory-unsafe language like C++.<p>I&#x27;m using a lot of languages now that offer significantly more safety, both memory and type (including OCaml, Golang, and playing with Rust).<p>Even with the very welcome additions of C++11/14, it still seems like I&#x27;m stepping back into a previous era when I write C++.

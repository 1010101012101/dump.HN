541385,comment,541363,541370,0,0,siong1987,,,"There are too many publishers publishing books about Ruby. The market is really very competitive. But, you hardly see many ObjC books in the market right now. This may be the reason why ObjC book sale increases.<p>If you are using Ruby, you don't have to worry about memory management at all. But, if you are using ObjC, you have to worry about memory management especially if you are developing iphone application.(only iPhone doesn't have GC.)<p>Anyway, a GCC compiler can actually compile objC, so, it is not actually a Apple only language. Basically, any linux system with GCC compiler can compile objC too.",1238561852
541384,comment,540646,540860,0,0,chime,,,"GM faced the classical agency problem where the interests of owners and managers are not aligned with each other. Usually, if the managers (executives) own 40-50% or more, OR own less than 10% of the share, their interests are well aligned with those of the common shareholders because if the company benefits, they benefit. It is when senior managers own between 15-25% of the stock that they tend to use their positions for their personal benefits instead of those of the shareholders. This is known as entrenchment.<p>For companies where managers own 0-10% of the stock, cash bonuses make them take larger short-term risks. A better solution is long-term stock options for the senior executives and cash for the middle or lower levels. However, as recent turn of events has shown, lots of companies give these kind of stock options to lower and middle level managers who ended up with their entire life savings in the very companies that went bankrupt. The senior management was getting extremely large cash bonuses and thus they had no incentive to care for the long-term growth of the firm.",1238561830

541374,comment,540646,541190,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I like the mandatory savings plan, provided it is offered as an alternative to social security. The thing with mandatory savings plans (such as 401k's, were they mandated) is that ultimately the money belongs to the individual, and you can effectively access the money as you like when you borrow against it. My point is that the people who are not likely to save on their own accord are the same ones who will effectively spend their savings through debt.",1238560449

541361,comment,540139,541041,0,0,jerf,,,"""""letting the market figure it out"" is unregulated capitalism.""<p>No, Adam503 chooses to misinterpret ""letting the market figure it out"" as unregulated capitalism so that (s)he can go off on a more-or-less entirely unrelated rant.<p>What letting the market figure it out <i>really</i> means here is that instead of a glorious upper authority picking the ""winner"" by handing out government funds to a proven-loser business model to prop it up (""winner"" hardly seems like the right word), that we unleash the creativity of thousands or millions of people in the confident belief that where there is unmet demand, someone will find a way to supply it.<p>Did you think my example list was just randomly tossed in there or something? It's the core of the point; government action can only look to the past. Your actions will simply guarantee the extinction of journalism, because the system you want to prop up is dying before competition even fully matures, which is the ultimate proof of economic death.<p>What regulations you may or may not want to lay down on such actions is an entirely separate point, and if you can't see that, you're simply being willfully blind to the point I'm making because you've been so conditioned in your response to the word ""capitalism"" that you can't see past it anymore. The fact that Amazon.com created a new meeting point for supply and demand is neither here nor there in the question of whether they are regulated (hint: yes).<p>Again... this sort of thing has happened <i>millions</i> of times. It's not a wacky theory, it's how we got from the dark ages to the economy of today. (The wacky theory is that this creation is impossible and only happens when central authorities help it along; this flatly contradicts the historical facts.) This time is only different because now the town crier is facing disruption, and he's being loud about it. Other than that, it's hardly different than any other industry which has been transformed over the past 50 years, which is most of them.",1238559619

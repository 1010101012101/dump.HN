Regional identities are PARTICULARLY useful, as they help unite groups of people who share a common history, traditional, and cultural memory.

The notion that sizing a market (as others have mentioned: a Fermi problem) is the same kind of knowledge as that which makes babies close their mouths and wave their arms when immersed in water? Venture investing truly is child&#x27;s play :D<p>Let &quot;sizing a marked&quot; mean &quot;estimating the number of products that can be sold to a given population of persons&quot;. An very precise estimate of this number is currently very hard to provide, but giving an order of magnitude estimate is clearly a Fermi problem. Note that the difficulty is providing an accurate and tight bound, not an accurate but imprecise one and that the latter might be valuable too.<p>Solving a Fermi problem requires estimating a series of numbers from everyday experience. One then multiplies these number together in a mechanical fashion, which could be done in a &quot;ready-at-hand&quot; way by use of a tool. Evidently the process invariably requires contemplating one&#x27;s every-day experience, and since ordinarily that experience is simply lived this meta-action is an act filled with &quot;presence&quot;.<p>By the way, the problem of capitalism is solved, and the solution shows that it will allocate capital optimally; this is one of the main arguments in favour of capitalist systems.<p>The problem that the social reality in which we live only partially approximates capitalism (see: non-profit organizations) is the big problem economists, and anyone else using classical economic theory in the real world, struggle with.",1450184079

This diary holds allocated jobs to do each sprint, together with a record of what was done each day.<p>Because all of my work information is available in the repository as text (markdown or YAML or JSON) - it means that I can automate my workflow in ways that would be much harder to achieve otherwise.<p>For example, I can extract appropriate git commit messages automatically from this diary, meaning that I have perfect traceability back to requirements on every commit. I can get my build to (optionally) commit changes automatically (rolling back if the build was not successful). I can even get it to (again optionally) make sure that all changes associated with a particular job are kept on a separate branch until that job is complete.

This is understandable, because a lot of people use incorrect terms like &quot;intellectual <i>property</i>&quot;. Creative works are <i>not</i> &quot;property&quot;, because they are not a <i>scarce resource</i>. The entire concept of &quot;property&quot; rights is an attempt to solve the problem that two people cannot use the same scarce good.<p>Freaking out when other people reuse your <i>ideas</i> - which are infinitely copyable without depriving anyone of their copy - is a childish reaction. However, to &quot;promote the sciences and useful arts&quot;, we invented a government-granted <i>temporary monopoly</i> on certain types of creative works (which we call &quot;copyright&quot; and &quot;patent&quot;). These monopolies <i>do not create &quot;property&quot;</i>; they merely grant you the exclusive right to sell or distribute a given idea for a period of time.<p>> I even legally own the content<p>No, you don&#x27;t. You have a copyright on some creative works. This copyright creates a few rights related to distribution/etc. It does not create &quot;property&quot;. These temporary monopolies follow an entirely different set of laws than <i>property rights</i>. For specific information on those laws, I suggest talking to an actual lawyer.<p>> the ads on websites pay for the content<p>You&#x27;ve repeated this a lot in this thread. I guarantee you that <i>nobody</i> here misunderstands this point, or is confused where the funding for some websites (or TV shows, etc) <i>currently</i> comes form.<p>> They actually believe all this stuff is and should be free to them.<p>Making up straw-man opponents is an easy way to argue, and helps you avoid cognitive dissonance. It might help if you stop ascribing the intentions you think some of us have, and start listening to the facts we&#x27;re trying to tell you.<p>I have suggested alternative ways of funding (ads are only <i>one</i> way to fund creative works). I have also tried to explain that there is a difference between your distribution rights, and what someone can do with your creative works once you hand them over.<p>You must get really annoyed at the very-large number of people that use Tivos to skip commercials on the TV they watch. That is their right. Technology has simply advanced far enough that the average person can start exercising their rights <i>to consume the creative content however they want</i>.<p>Unfortunately, quite a few people have been ignoring our warnings over the last 20+ years that these advances in technology are probably going to change certain business models that relied on people <i>not</i> skipping commercials. These changes in technology also enable new business models, including some that nobody has even thought of yet because the internet is still &quot;new&quot;.<p>Some people (Netflix is a canonical example) have explored new business models and have adapted well to the new market landscape. Others... have not. I suggest exploring new business ideas in your endeavors - I&#x27;m sure there are ways you can adapt.<p>On the other hand, if you insist on following this incorrect model of the world where you make up contract law and legal obligations, and pretend ideas are property, you are going to have a harder and harder time.

Skill + followers = reward. People in the top spots have earned their place.<p>Anyone who has participated in a creative profession long enough will have seen many brilliantly talented people fail, and critiques will follow as to why they missed out (obsessive personality, no marketability, poor communication, not in touch with reality, poor career trajectory, no exposure, etc). Creative people are pinned against each other, so these critiques flow from fellow producers too, and sadly when one person calls it a day, others will see opportunity left in their wake and attempt to fill the gap only to deal with similar patterns. Mostly failure is just part of the biz and no real indicator of talent.<p>Many will reach for the &#x27;lottery&#x27; metaphor to justify creative economy, which I think at it&#x27;s heart is true. Creative capital is amassed by a tiny minority in a global pool, and the &#x27;pop&#x27; market intends to keep it this way - it&#x27;s much easier to manage and account for a tiny list of select &#x27;important&#x27; people, rally behind them and create an economy that benefits all parties (distributors and artists) than to embrace the entirety of creative output.<p>But again there are exceptions. And these are the ones maintaining &#x27;creative integrity&#x27;, who then become every other artists benchmark for succeeding against the odds. They help fertilize the pool, keep enthusiasm up and make people have faith that good work can succeed. Again another lottery, and these rare successes  often become heavily fortified by the same industry, itself championing the outsider and benefiting from the perceived &#x27;integrity&#x27;.<p>However, when you decide to give up on the supply chain completely and present yourself to an audience honestly things can actually come good. There are audiences that have given up on the supply chain too, and are sympathetic to artists presenting themselves with all their frailties. Once a connection is made, these people become real subscribers and will pay to keep this connection flowing and will even help advertise the artists they love (think t-shirts). There are many great examples of artists who have decided to control their supply chain, get intimate with an audience, and nurture the connection as directly as possible. They still work with mass culture but only as an interface to build audience.<p>How hard is it for these Vloggers to do the same, kick the supply-chain (freeloading hits) and direct their core audience to their own supply. Surely it&#x27;s as simple as adding to their &#x27;please like / subscribe to our channel&#x27; spiel with a &#x27;and to see our other content visit our website direct&#x27;.<p>Maybe something will disrupt the &#x27;pop&#x27; industry and create equity, but when mass piracy doesn&#x27;t change much and pay services still only give majority revenue to top billers, it seems that &#x27;pop&#x27; is more agile than most give lip service to.",1450181575

I believe, that we&#x27;ll get some kind of hybrid solution: computer drives on the highway during daytime otherwise drivers takes over.<p>Most likely, it&#x27;ll start out as driving assist systems (like an advanced cruise control, similar to what tesla recently deployed). The computer does the driving, but the car needs a driver in the drivers seat, picking his nose and waiting for the very rare instance when intervention is needed.<p>To be honest, I think this would be a step back. Risk compensation[0] will ensure humans will put way too much faith in the system, and not be alert enough to intervene when needed. Plus, driving is boring enough when you&#x27;re actually driving the car. Just sitting still on a 4+ hour journey, not able to actually do anything else (because you need to keep your eyes on the road) sounds like a special kind of hell to me.<p>Self-driving cars would be a huge leap forward. More driving assist systems will just make people less careful.<p>We can already see a lot of manufacturers rebranding their driving assist systems as &quot;self-driving cars&quot; because it&#x27;s the cool thing to do.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_compensation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_compensation</a>",1450181097

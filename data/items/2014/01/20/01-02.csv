It looks like it does run on PHPBB...<p>In theory, it sounds like the goal of the SWAT was to clear the building of employees, and break into the target server, while no one would be sitting at an office workstation, and thus rendered incapable of disrupting the attack. It sounds like all that effort actually worked.<p>So then, after everyone returned to the office, staff discovered the intrusion, and they performed a password reset for anyone who hasn&#x27;t changed their forum password since 2010.<p>But! Were the forum credentials valuable? Do people do things like mine bitcoins with their hosting? Is the PHPBB MySQL database isolated from all other user credentials, or is there overlap?",1390183102

Furthermore, do you need to pay for the server&#x27;s forced minimum storage requirements (e.g. 20 GB * 0.16 USD per ? - I&#x27;m assuming monthly here) or do you only have to pay for your additional requirements?<p>EDIT: also, the suggested packages on the more detailed overview page list a 512mb RAM / 1 vCPU instance which is no longer available at all - (isn&#x27;t that what heroku offers for free)?",1390183014

Kids these days are more engaged on their smart phones messaging friends vs spending time in the play ground with them face to face.

I don&#x27;t like anything that focuses on files, because in my mind the fact that code needs to be saved in the filesystem is simply incidental, so no code should rely on that fact; but Rails builds on top of that, telling you where to put your code (folder structure), taking control from you over what code sees what code (MVC), giving you command-line tools to use when it could simply provide functions at a REPL (gems, migrations, tests), etc. It simply doesn&#x27;t get it at all.<p>In my opinion, a framework (loosely speaking) that solves only the easy problems (how to organize code) is pointless. But something like an FRP library that allows me to do GUI by focusing on how I want to transform data, and liberating me from thinking about events and callbacks - THAT to me is something that solves a hard problem.<p>So to answer your first question, I&#x27;m happy not to need to touch Rails again - right now I only need to look at it, rewrite it in Racket, and delete it.<p>Racket is a much nicer system than Clojure, it has immensely intelligent people behind it, the documentation is stellar (unbelievably so, in my opinion), there are libraries for everything you can imagine and more (like an FRP library). It also does native GUI everywhere, effortlessly. For things it lacks, it is easy to write an FFI.<p>I would never touch Java nor trust any library written in Java. The more I code the more I distrust code that relies on mutability. I haven&#x27;t reached 100% pure code yet but I work towards that goal, not away from it.<p>EDIT: Yes, I am using Racket for a webapp that connects to a database and perform general CRUD operations.",1390179968

It is because the relevant quantity is the <i>marginal</i> value of an additional nurse practitioner, not the <i>average</i> value.  And why is it fair to pay people according to their <i>marginal</i> value, and not their average value?  That is because it incentives the most efficient behavior.  An additional software engineer is worth more to society than an additional nurse.  The fact that getting rid of all nurses would be worse than getting rid of all software engineers (assuming this was true) is irrelevant, because as people quit the nursing profession, wages will rise.<p>So the problem is not capitalism, but people&#x27;s inability to accept that the implications of economics theory: first, that there is no ethical reason to reward people for the average value of a person in their profession, as opposed to the marginal value, and second, that frivolous things like Twitter can be as valuable as medical services (if people are willing to pay as much for either).",1390179623

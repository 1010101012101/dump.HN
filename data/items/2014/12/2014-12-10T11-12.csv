I put them into 0x40 assembly riddles, each one should teach you about one thing.<p>You could also get the hard copy for those snippets, though all of them are on the website.<p>How to use it? Get an assembler (Yasm or Nasm is recommended), and obtain the x86_64 instruction set. Then for every snippet, try to understand what it does. Try to run it with different inputs if you don&#x27;t understand it in the beginning. Look up for instructions you don&#x27;t fully know in the Instruction Sets PDF. Start from the beginning. The order has some meaning.<p>Enjoy, and send me your feedback.",1418212628

That&#x27;s because real science progresses based on proof, not just one or two data points that may or may not be significant. The fact is there were scientists that supported the theory and they didn&#x27;t all get sacked, and nor did Wegener.<p>The real problem is that sometimes all we have are a few data points. That&#x27;s when opinion and fact can get blurred, and geology was in that situation before the 50s. Nobody could prove continental drift and nobody could disprove it. That doesn&#x27;t mean that those who doubted it were stupid, in fact several of the scientists resonsible for producing the most compelling evidence for the theory were initialy sceptics. That didn&#x27;t stop them doing good science and following the evidence.<p>Its far too easy to look at an episode in the hitory of science like this and draw a bright triumphalist line between those who were right and those who were in the end proven wrong.",1418212391

That would result in a loss of information, but would not be quite so easy to spot and filter out. The pathological case is really just a good illustration of what happens and why, whereas what&#x27;s trickier is understanding the true impact it has on real-world data.<p>For instance, you won&#x27;t notice Moiré patterns in photos very often, but it&#x27;s easy to construct a test image that demonstrates the problem. The underlying issue of sampling error hasn&#x27;t gone away in the photo: it just gets lost in the background noise or among smooth-shaded surfaces without hard edges, which makes it harder to see. But maybe now and then you&#x27;ll have a sharp edge in a real-world image where the effect is noticeable. Depending on how close it is to the pathological case, it might not jump out and make itself immediately obvious.<p>I mention Moiré patterns because these are (I believe) precisely the same effect as the given audio aliasing example. Moiré patterns aren&#x27;t a form of sampling error per se, but they can be caused by uniform sampling (which is how digital quantisation typically works for both audio and images).",1418210531

8728658,comment,8727312,8728273,0,0,jseg123,,,"Using Gentoo, (no GUI just bash command line environment) and ALSA back-end, I got a latency of 64 samples, which seemed indistinguishable from dedicated sampler hardware when triggering audio files in Csound via a USB MIDI keyboard. This was using a 1.2 ghz Pentium M Toshiba laptop with basic on-board Intel soundcard. An i5 540m @ 2.67 ghz goes down to 16 samples (at least with no complaints from ALSA or Csound). An external USB soundcard on the i5 seems to go no lower than 32 samples.
The main thing is making sure ALSA connects directly to your soundcard without going through dmix. This of course limits you to using one audio app at a time. If you need to have multiple applications making/receiving at low latencies , you will need to deal with the tedious per-session configuration of JACK.",1418210142

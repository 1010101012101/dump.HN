4113735,comment,4113540,4113540,2,0,jspru,,,"I really enjoy the wp7 platform - developing apps is a cakewalk compared to iOS / Android and fragmentation is nonexistent. As a user of both iOS and wp7... wp7 just has a better overall user experience, it's not massive - but it's many small incremental improvements that add up.<p>Here's their problem: the carrier / retail ecosystem for WP7 sucks in the US. It's clear that they don't have any carriers truly on board except for AT&T... which is easily the worst carrier in my area (Chicago) in terms of both reliability and pricing.<p>Verizon has ONE crap Windows Phone, the HTC Trophy - possibly the worst Windows Phone available. So that's a no go. Sprint also has a single crappy phone. T-Mobile has a whole two phones - Lumia 710 (a crap version of the Lumia 900), and the HTC Radar - which is actually pretty nice, but hobbled by only 8GB of built-in storage. Even then, go to any of those stores and you'll have a rep trying to sell you an Android phone when you walk in the door. Check their websites and you'll see WP7 phones are at the very bottom.<p>Priority #1 should be fixing their retail/carrier ecosystem. The platform is fantastic, and there are some damn good phones too - but you're screwed unless you're on AT&T.",1339711147

Plenty of in-browser apps go awry, but that's most often because the tools people start using (notably jQuery) just don't work well once you have a large collection of UI components on the page.<p>That said, the bulk of Google's web applications, for instance, are not written in GWT or Dart, but rather in JavaScript using Closure Library, and compiled using the Closure compiler.  So I don't think the answer here is to not use JavaScript (although I can understand why people at Adobe would argue for that), but rather to use tools like Closure or Angular that make the process more straightforward.",1339710963

Searching the AngularJS site, there are zero references to ""Web Components"".  Web Components are so new that the spec still has Norse mythology references, so a reference from Angular to the spec would be a big help.<p>More importantly, while Angular has been duplicating the functionality of Underscore and jQuery, the rest of the JS world is extending itself with CommonJS modules according to spec.  Half of the builtwith.angularjs.org examples include jQuery anyway.  Angular's attempt to be a complete ""end-to-end solution"" may easily make it a jack-of-all-trades, master of none.

WebGL, for example, covers over a lot of issues with OpenGL (security and convenience), making the web version very nice to use.<p>Last time I tried WebGL version of Quake3 on my machine which had the hi-end AMD graphics card at that time, it ran at less than 100FPS. For a game that's 10 years old that is a very poor result. The reason why I said bindings is because I want a language powerful enough to implement any technology I want <i>in</i> that language.<p>> There is no simple solution here.<p>Of course it's not simple. It doesn't mean it's not possible. Microsoft's WinRT is another example of coming closer to the native code apps.",1339710917

If everything was done perfectly, then on average your timezone is already out of whack with local solar time by about 15 minutes or so.  Of course we don't do it perfectly, most of us jump another hour back and forth each year for no particularly good reason.  Who cares about another second?  Just let solar and calendar time drift apart.<p>The amount of time until a timezone is noticeably out of whack with solar time is substantially longer than how long timezones have existed in anything like the modern form.  In a thousand years maybe we'll start moving timezones around.  But the cost of moving them for astronomical reasons will happen orders of magnitude less often than moving them for random political reasons.<p>I have read arguments both ways.  And I remain convinced that letting UTC slowly drift away from Greenwich is a perfectly reasonable solution that will save us from many potential software bugs, and will cause no significant disruptions in life for the next ten thousand years.  Of course eventually the Earth's rotation will slow down enough that the drift of time zones will become noticeable on a human time scale.  But that problem is many thousands of years off, let them solve it then.  If all goes well they will have had to figure out how they want to handle local calendar time not fitting UTC for people living on asteroids and other planets, and can just adapt that solution to Earth...",1339710225

Nobody actually wants it -- certainly not the generals, who already have all the volunteers they need and have no interest in babysitting a bunch of shiftless eighteen-year-olds who'd rather be anywhere else. Modern military forces require lots of expensive hardware controlled by a small number of well-trained people; we don't do cannon fodder any more.<p>A non-military draft to force eighteen-year-olds to go out and plant trees or pick up litter is one of those stupid ideas that gets floated around from time to time by people complaining about kids these days, but apart from being vastly politically unpopular it's almost certainly unconstitutional; the Supreme Court upheld conscription in 1918 under Congress's power to declare war and raise armies, but conscripting people for non-military purposes couldn't possibly have the same legal justification so it would have to be against the thirteenth amendment ""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude... shall exist""",1339708309

IE has a weird box model, haslayout, buggy float handling, etc.<p>Of course it's possible to make things work, in case of a simple layout, most of the time not even hard (note that this wasn't my point at all), but if you code in a standards-compliant, normal way, without doing anything to especially accomodate IE7, there are a number of situation where things will just not work, while working in every other browser.<p>Is this a problem? Yeah. I would say so. People shouldn't be supporting something and thereby supporting the continued use of a product that doesn't work unless you coddle it. What if someone is a linux user? Are they supposed to buy a windows license just to coddle to users who are hurting the web with their browsing choice?<p>I'm by no means an expert designer, but I've been doing HTML stuff for a decade or so, from simple to complicated.

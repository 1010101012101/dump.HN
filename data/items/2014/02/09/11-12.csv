It would be reasonable to cancel such an endeavor: leaving your legacy up to filmmakers is not a wise move, as Woz recently discovered.  Since that&#x27;s the only scenario in which this cancellation would be reasonable, I assumed that was the reason.<p>Actually not.  This is purely a creative work which has been completely sunk for no reason other than &quot;You didn&#x27;t run it by me ahead of time.&quot;  It was clearly a work of passion.  Watch the video: <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/878782324/birth-of-man-a-minecraft-feature-film"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/878782324/birth-of-man-...</a><p>Yes, it&#x27;s Notch&#x27;s right to cancel this artist&#x27;s dream.  It&#x27;s also his right to add in-game purchases to Minecraft, and force people to pay extra for the privilege of using diamond pickaxes.  Both of those decisions wouldn&#x27;t reflect favorably upon him, however.<p>EDIT:  My main problem with this move is that the film didn&#x27;t involve Notch in any way.  It&#x27;s unrelated to him except insofar as it uses his game as a setting for an artistic work.  It seems like the primary motivation for the cancellation was rooted in greed.",1391947079

7205228,comment,7204515,7205026,3,0,weland,,,"> Really, the only way an experienced developer is going to end up flipping burgers or flying a manager&#x27;s desk is because they have lost the desire to learn - ie fallen out of love with programming in general. I believe few people work in this industry for money alone - you either love programming or you don&#x27;t do it - and if you love it then you will pick up new technologies out of sheer intellectual curiosity.<p>I think this is spot-on!<p>Mere inflexibility or old-fashionedness is often not enough to make one unemployable. I have colleagues who insist on various odd-and-nearly-dying technologies without that having a negative impact on their work. I have my own perks, like instantly turning off syntax highlighting whenever I have to use a new editor (sadly, the state of most embedded development ecosystems usually means new MCU = new fucking everything, oh, and on Windows!).<p>What I do find troubling and hope I never get is something akin to calcification, only intellectual rather than physical. I currently work for a company that has developed, among others, various computer security tools. Consequently, I have a lot of colleagues who have spent their entire careers writing software for nothing other than Windows. Some of them get very excited when they talk to me about other operating systems (I haven&#x27;t used Windows, except when occasionally forced to, like a few years ago because well fuck you too Microchip!); I get to find out interesting stuff about various pieces in Windows, they find out about interesting stuff that hasn&#x27;t made it to Windows (like ZFS) and we get to compare programming approaches.<p>Then there&#x27;s the other group. The people who are absolutely 100% convinced that the only way to do something is the one they know. Unix? Phbt. Broken because the applications keep their settings all over the fucking place in whatever format they want. Windows does it neatly and keeps them in the Registry, in a singular format. You mean you read a file to find out if an Ethernet device has a link? That&#x27;s really clumsy, what does a file have to do with anything? Why don&#x27;t they give you a neat API? What do you mean &quot;What happens if you want to use it from a language that doesn&#x27;t have bindings for that API&quot;? You got C# and C++ for complicated apps, VBScript for moderate ones, PowerShell for scripting and a bunch of hipster stuff like F#. Python? There&#x27;s no support for that in Visual Studio, I&#x27;m not sure it even exists.<p>Sadly, the latter camp vastly outnumbers the former. It&#x27;s not a case of I&#x27;ll-just-use-the-tool-I-know-best. I see programmers I honestly respect doing that for the sake of safety: X is probably a better fit than Y for this, but I know Y inside-out and I only know the name of X. Deadline fast approaching + Y can do it as well without being bastardized = we&#x27;re using Y.<p>No, these guys are at the other end of the spectrum: it&#x27;s the &quot;Y is a programming tool, I need to program something ergo I use Y&quot;. Technical merit is secondary as long as we can do it, and human effort is not only expendable, it&#x27;s being paid for. The fact that this misled can-do attitude is indistinguishable from the one backed by technical prowess to most people in HR and management certainly doesn&#x27;t help.",1391946640

Quantum theory shows that, even though physical laws, and cause/effect relationships, still exist, outcomes aren&#x27;t predetermined -- there is more than enough indeterminacy in outcomes to justify an argument for free will.<p>Someone might argue that, if quantum probability only allows a certain number of possible outcomes and one of those outcomes will be selected randomly, therefore free will is disproven by that essentially mathematical process. But if there are enough such outcomes in a timeline, the real difference between many stochastic quantum picks and what most people think of as free will, may seem academic.<p>> What we like to call free will is just the deterministic result of processes to complex to be understood, modelled or predicted.<p>That may be true, but it cuts both ways.

Totality exists within the umbra.<p>In some orientations of the Moon&#x27;s orbit, it&#x27;s further from the Earth (and hence smaller relative the much more distant and constant-sized Sun), and despite the fact that an observer is directly behind the Moon relative to the Sun, totallity isn&#x27;t observed.  This is an <i>annular eclipse</i>, where the Sun forms a ring around the Moon.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annular_eclipse#Types"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annular_eclipse#Types</a>",1391946087

Worst case is that they have to rewrite everything.<p>I&#x27;m in a position where pretty much exactly 5 years ago, at the company I worked at we evaluated which web-framework and programming language we should switch to and rewrite the product in (that was previously written in Perl).<p>We decided to go with Java, as it seemed a safe bet. That was before Sun was bought and, while Java wasn&#x27;t an innovation leader, the language was being properly maintained. E.g. Lambdas didn&#x27;t seem to far away, there was talk about replacing get/set methods with properties etc. Then Oracle came along and drove the whole process straight off a cliff. Meanwhile, even Objective C has both properties and blocks!<p>We chose the Seam Framework: Open Source, innovative, trying to get their stuff into the standards. The last part actually worked somewhat, however stateful web framework have proven to be a looser: Especially in enterprise, back in 08/09 browser performance was terrible and you&#x27;d try to do as much as possible on the server. Today, it&#x27;s the other way around.<p>Plus, the stateful Seam Framework works really bad in the cloud. Each server needs memory to store session state. Want to load balance requests between servers? Want to be able to kill a server? Synchronize the state between servers and loose as much performance as you gain by adding a new server. Plus, you&#x27;ll always have to buy beefy instances to have enough memory at hand. 5 years ago, cloud was much more about IaaS than PaaS and during the hype anything was ready-for-cloud and every solution had lots of initial quirks.<p>We tried to make a couple of safer bets 5 years ago. We lost. As a programmer, I easily moved on to greener pastures. But migrating that product off to something like Angular in the frontend or to a stateless architecture in the backend? Even if the new technology doubles the development speed, halfs the maintenance effort and hosting costs, it&#x27;ll take a massive investment... by the time it pays off, half of the technology is probably hopelessly outdated again.",1391944691

The thing is, the market for translations is very limited, and usually larger for English->Spanish (or Catalan) than in reverse. My all-time favourite book was by a Catalan writer, homaging Hammett by writing a crime novel set in the Barcelona of the late 60s (IIRC, maybe it was early 70s) where the dictatorship was still in full swing and illegal goods were still a good deal (much like Hammett&#x27;s setting during the Prohibition.) In case you can find an English edition, it&#x27;s called &quot;De mica en mica s&#x27;omple la pica,&quot; in Catalan (Drop by drop the sink fills up would be a rough translation, it&#x27;s a typical Catalan saying.) A quick googling and amazon didn&#x27;t turn up any translation, though.",1391943726

Playing in the mobile arena is better for Google than not playing at all. We chose to allow service providers to arbitrate the network and it's not as if our loyalty has anything to do with Google's success?<p>Consumers are swines.

248143,comment,248097,248097,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I often open my posts with a quote pulled from the comment that I'm responding to, just so that the post will make more sense when pulled out of context; e.g. on searchyc.com or when someone is scanning down the page.<p>But I think that not having formal blockquote formatting subtly encourages me to avoid sprinkling blockquotes throughout my posts -- or, worse, sprinking my words throughout an endless series of blockquotes. Instead I generally restrict myself to one big blockquote, in italics, at the <i>start</i> of my own writing, and I think <i>very</i> carefully before I try to insert a blockquote in the middle of a post. Such mid-post quoting requires careful wording and formatting to make the change in author clear, which is appropriate because it encourages me to just write in my own words and leave other people's words alone. :) I think that's a useful constraint.<p>The lack of blockquote formatting also encourages us to keep the blockquotes as short as possible. And it helps the flow of comments and responses to flow nicely down the page -- it's easy to see if a block of text is part of a post or part of a response to that post, because (with the exception of code blocks) only responses change the indentation.<p>In short, I think the missing blockquote formatting is a feature, not a bug.",1216258177

Also, did you edit your original comment? Perhaps I misread it.<p>In any event, it remains awfully convenient to chalk up the evident YC fetish at TechCrunch to mere editor laziness: I've seen plenty of seed-funded or non-funded startups in the past months-- heck, TC <i>pays</i> folks to sort through the mountains of press releases that arrive every day; I'm sure that there is no dearth of interesting, upstarting startups to profile.<p>I've always gotten the impression that TechCrunch serves up a fairly decent mixed bag-- except when they seem to exclusively cover YC-funded startups. Hence, my prior remarks.",1216257772

A week ago they were (figuratively) throwing him tomatoes at his face, (and yahoo too), now they are applauding at this?  What changed in a week?

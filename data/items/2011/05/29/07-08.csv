Here are two that I would like to tackle but don't have the resources for. Both games which are not my field but which my daydream is to setup a small indie games company for when I one day do an exit and have some money...<p>First one is along the lines of a tower defence but instead of attackers you have a crowd wanting to protest. The 'people' are quite good sim's in that they should behave according to research - lots of people crammed in are more violent than a widely spaced crowd. You, the player, will get different scenarios - protecting a visiting dignitary, policing a conference centre, a town square etc. etc. an obviously your level ups will be increasingly heavy duty riot control equipment: vans, water hoses, helicopters etc.<p>Second one was a sandbox type game like minecraft or dwarf fortress with the addition of seriously mega threats. For example a dragon living in an area that cannot be defeated without either building and planning serious defences (over a period of days or weeks) or massive co-operation. Games are either too formulaic or immediate - but there are lots of people prepared to work on long term construction projects in these kind of games, would be interesting to tap into that.<p>I still think execution is 90% of the battle with an idea and I am going to have a crack at both of these given half a chance. Don't think either of them are million sellers but far too many games are clones of one another and it's good to introduce new concepts",1306655510

HN is a great community and imo members should be treated as responsible adults.<p>Comments that are ""(a) mean and/or (b) dumb"" are a problem. However, I think that the people who make these comments are going to make the comments regardless of whether comment scores are visible or not. After the visibility-change, I didn't see any positive change in comment quality (but I've wondered if comment quantity has increased)<p>Obviously, this is a subjective assessment. For everyone who believes as I do, I suspect that many others believe that they have seen a qualitative improvement in comments.<p>Regardless, I think that it will be great for HN to self-police itself as a community of responsible adults (and responsible teens) instead of assuming that HN is an <i>immature community that needs to be protected from looking at comment scores.</i>\n---<p>2. Hiding comment scores skews the scores. Some people have said that they don't upvote comments because they don't know what the comment's score is.<p>OTH some populist comments (or comments from popular members) are going to get insanely high scores because upvoters don't realize that the banal comment's score is already much higher than what it should have been.\n---<p>3.

2596216,comment,2594437,2594437,1,0,esrauch,,,"My first reaction is to simply write all the powers of -2 (1, -2, 4, -8...) and simply brute force each of 1-10 to find a solution for how to write a particular number. I think this is what the OP replied below as ""looks right"", but I think thats actually simply one form of base 2.<p>The definition of writing something in base n is that you are expressing a number it using n unique values for each digit. Using these digits, there is a way of utilizing the space maximally to write any positive integer which is the above method of packing the values. Simply using n unique values and having each digit #d represent the power n^d.<p>For base -2, using -2 unique symbols is clearly nonsense. Assigning each digit a power of -2 and allowing for symbols 0 or 1 for each digit is actually just base 2, exactly like how gray code is base 2. It's interesting that its a form of base 2 that has an implicit sign-bit, but its also somewhat strange of a property since it ends up with twice as many negative numbers as positive numbers for any set number of bits.<p>Microsoft should clearly hire me.",1306654087

There are a ton of spaces you can venture into via programming. By your wish list it seems like you want to build web-apps.<p>I currently work for a yc-funded startup as a rails developer. I have no further formal education beyond high-school. I happen to say this a lot but it's exactly for people like you. You don't need a formal CS degree to build web-apps  specifically. Of course I couldn't work for google atm but the point is you need to pick WHAT you want to build. Chances are what you like does not involve the stuff you think you need to learn. If you want to work on natural language processing sure you may need some more formal training, but a CRUD app is a CRUD app is a CRUD app.<p>So what do you want to build? What do you <i>really</i> want to build?<p>If you want to be a web junky I can help you there:<p>1) Run Linux.<p>Or get a macbook if you can afford it but you will still need to know Linux since your app will likely be on a linux-based instance. You NEED to know your away around the command line. You might need to check logs or do some sql on your staging server or something. GIT is also a must and runs on the command-line. You'll debug your app in console mode. You'll run rspec tests in console. You'll launch your first rails app on <a href=""http://heroku.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://heroku.com</a>. Next get a <a href=""http://linode.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linode.com</a> and follow the tutorials about how to set up your own server. (the point is learning how its done, not necessarily being a pro sysadmin).<p>2) Rails.<p>Follow this tutorial and you will finally be able to build that blog engine =) <a href=""http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html</a><p>(note: I usually recommend <a href=""http://www.sinatrarb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sinatrarb.com/</a> as someone's first web-app in ruby but it seems like you understand programming enough to tackle rails, though the sinatra is ass-simple and lets you get your hands dirty with ruby itself. But knowing your way around rails is a definite plus on the employability side.<p>3) Get GOOD at MySQL (or another datastore).<p>Apps nowadays are all about the data. The trouble with frameworks is they grow increasingly dependent on abstractions. I'd wager that a good number of employed Rails dev's couldn't write their own sql. Using an ORM is great and has great MVC an advantages but you can't let it be your crutch. Nosql is damned cool but mysql is the defacto standard so therefore gets +1 on employability.<p>4) Javascript.<p>I would not recommend doing any kind of javascript ""the rails way"". Just nevermind all the stuff you read about javascript whenever it has anything to do with rails. The reason is because you don't actually be writing javascript and you need to learn how to write good, unobstrusive javascript. To speed things up you should be good with <a href=""http://jquery.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jquery.com</a>. Many here advocate learning to code without a framework but jquery is <i>that good</i>. Again just don't use it as a crutch.<p>Well that's about it for now. Please feel free to ask me questions as these things are surely not as straight forward as I've laid them out to be. Even getting rails up and running can be a pain in the ass (hopefully you aren't on windows). My email is in my profile.<p>Remember, I sincerely believe the most important thing is officially working out what it is you <i>really</i> want to create and then you can assess how to get there.<p>Have fun!<p>Oh almost forgot. Some great advice I got from a fellow programmer I met in Boulder.

It doesn't even matter if it's with the hottest tools, or if it's with the worst tools in the stack. What matters is that you've stopped learning. And almost by definition, <i>anywhere</i> you move to from here, will be different from here - and thus, will give you a chance to learn.<p>Don't wait until you've found a ""perfect mentor"" to move. Don't do what I did, and kill your time and energy waiting for the perfect opportunity to move, learning nothing when you could have been learning something. Each thing you move to will give you a little more opportunity, a slightly different perspective. Sometimes you'll even take steps backwards by mistake - but that's OK. Turns out that you're learning from those too. What's important is that you keep moving.",1306653157

I can clearly recall seeing antique market photos from the 19th C clearly showing the double pot cooler throughout the middle east. (can't find reference sorry.)  It works especially well in hot dry climates where you can have extensive evaporation.  It doesn't work in humid or cold climates.  What's needed in North America is a return to the root cellar, and external cold sheds or window boxes for climates that fall below freezing.  Again this is not new technology, but was widespread in the 19c. (again, it is amazing that I can't find any image references for window box cold storage.)",1306652872

Beware, though: you'll spend a lot of time fixing other people's horrible code but the good news if you can do that effectively you can usually charge quite well for it (ie. when people get to the point where they decide they've ""outgrown"" their shitty PHP developer they usually have reasonable revenues and are ready to pay an expert some decent cash to fix the various problems).<p>Also, get a good grounding in relational database design. Learn how to draw an ERD (entity relationship diagram) and how to write SQL. Although all the cool kids will tell you that you need some ""NoSQL"" solution to be ""web scale"" designing your system with a solid data model simplifies development and maintenance considerably.<p>Overall, I think you're better off doing some freelancing. If nothing else, this will give you exposure to many of the problems faced by real businesses and people every day - there are no shortages of itches to scratch when you're dealing with the ""Fortune 5,000,000"" - just ask 37signals.com ;)",1306652476

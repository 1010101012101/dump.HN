As I grow older I'm thinking more about how to show other people how to do the things I figured out when I was younger and how to organize groups of people to get things done on a broader scale.<p>I don't want to stop thinking like I did when I was younger, though.  It's important to continue learning things, which probably means paying some attention to lower-level topics.<p>Today is my birthday.  [argh]<p>",1194793160

I've become so accustomed to not understanding most of what's being said around me that when someone is speaking English within earshot it's ridiculously distracting. Even when I can't make out what they're saying the familiar sounds cause my brain to go nuts (in a background process) trying to interpret.",1194790396

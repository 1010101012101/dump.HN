And any solicitation that doesn't mention price is usually to be able to convince you of the value of which you would initially reject off the top as ""to expensive"". The other reason is to get you to commit to something and therefore be less likely to pull out of a transaction.<p>Along those lines (hidden pricing) it is a good idea to not assume everyone knows why a service is free and why a user isn't being charged for it.  \nOn the other end of the bell curve of course is a price that is advertised and seems to cheap.

3464543,comment,3464176,3464268,3,0,SurenTer,,,"Ha-ha. Let's take Google's current approach to DMCA for instance. You are a small guy. A big guy sends a completely baseless DMCA complain. Google takes down the URL. Well, that’s the policy blah-blah; everything is according DMCA. You send a contra-down notice. According to DMCA you don’t need to explain anything. However Google sends you an email (I’m quoting) “We would like to help you, but we require more information.  Please provide additional details clarifying the reason for your reinstatement request.”  That put you in an awkward position. Since the initial take-down notice was completely baseless – you simply has nothing to provide. \nSo this time Google doesn’t react with the same speed. Their email reads “We have received your DMCA counter notification dated XX/XX/XXXX. As described in 17 U.S.C. 512(g), we will forward the counter notification to the complainant. If we do not receive notice that the complainant has brought a court action within 10 to 14 days, we will reinstate the material in question.”  As you can see – immediate respond just disappeared. Google wants to wait 10-14 days despite of direct and explicit SOPA text that allows (requires actually) reinstatement of the content. Just read it. Google is going to keep your content banned based on a started court action(!) - not the court verdict. \nWell, you might think it works both ways. If that’s the case – try to send a semi-baseless complain about a big guy page. Somehow it will not work the same way.<p>That's what happens right now. And that's Google. no-shmno evel - but Google does try to be neutral. That's as much as they could go.<p>And now SOPA/PIPA is about to create the situation when the same will happen with entire websites. Heh…",1326559402

The JavaScript hides the image tag, and sets it, another function verifies that it's a real image (imgur sends 200s, and an image that tells you an image doesn't exist, so I check that the height and width match).  If it does, then display the image, if not, try the next.  When the array is about to run out, I fill it again.  I also keep a small cache of the keys that it determined weren't valid (based on jQuery passing back to me the list of failed keys) to try to up the odds of getting an image quicker.<p>An unmini'ed version of the JavaScript is at <a href=""http://image-roulette.com/static/js/image-roulette.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://image-roulette.com/static/js/image-roulette.js</a><p>Any feedback would be awesome =)",1326558678

The issue here is that the media cartels would prefer to buy legislation to let them keep running their antiquated businesses without innovating and use legislation to just squash any challengers. If it was a purely legal problem, iTunes and Netflix wouldn't be kicking ass and making the music and movie/TV publishers so nervous.<p>I pay for Netflix (and it is responsible for >95% of all my TV/movie consumption) because it's the most convenient way for me to watch movies and TV shows. It's certainly not cheaper than torrenting movies, and I'm a programmer - there's no technical barrier that prevents me from torrenting movies. But I still pay for Netflix rather than torrenting movies because it's convenient, easy, legal, and satisfies my needs. If you can hit the ""easy"", ""affordable"", and ""satisfactory"" points in your distribution scheme, you'll manage to capture a huge number of sales that'd otherwise be lost to piracy.<p>The issue isn't ""piracy"", it's lost sales. The two are conflated way too often, and to our collective detriment. Literally nobody is hurt simply by the act of someone making an unauthorized duplication of a series of bytes. The problem is introduced when someone would have otherwise purchased whatever content they just copied. Simply copying files doesn't actually cost anyone anything - otherwise, I could just set up a couple of machines that transfer MP3s back and forth between themselves all day and put the RIAA out of business. The focus should be on ""how do we capture lost sales?"", rather than ""how do we stop all unauthorized copying of our byte-sequences?""<p>There are a lot of very smart, very successful people in the industry who believe and state that piracy is solved by modernizing distribution, and providing a legal way for people to get your goods that more convenient than the illegal methods. There's a lot of economic data and anecdotal evidence to suggest that they're right.<p>There is a problem with the sale of counterfeit physical goods on the internet, though, which is an entirely separate problem, which probably needs much more targeted and specific legislation to address it.",1326558331

The White House suggested last year that they could help track down\b ""circumvention devices"" such as game console mod chips. From the Office of White House's ""Copyright Czar"":<p><i>“[It] is illegal to import or traffic in devices that can be used to circumvent technological measures that control access to copyrighted works,” they wrote. “When DHS discovers the importation of a potential circumvention device, current law does not authorize DHS to share a sample with a rightholder to aid CBP in determining whether it is, in fact, a circumvention device. Allowing DHS to provide a sample would aid enforcement efforts.”</i>",1326557238

3464460,comment,3464299,3464299,3,0,akg,,,"To a certain degree this is true. I think the major reason for why we see a ""winner-take-all"" effect on the internet is because of data persistence. Usually the usage pattern for  brick-and-motor stores is that you visit it, get what you need, get out. With online services, however, the more data a site has, the more useful it becomes (e.g., social networks or Amazon's recommendation system). I think people subconsciously realize this and start to focus on one attractable service over another.<p>On the other hand, the ease of dissemination of products/services to users via the internet makes it so that niche markets are more efficiently served. This is usually harder to do with brick-and-mortar stores due to locality constraints. So even though, there might be ""one big winner"" there seems to be a growing market for niche products.",1326557056

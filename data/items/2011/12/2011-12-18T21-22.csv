3367600,comment,3367439,3367439,14,0,asanwal,,,"This is a fantastic guide that I think anyone thinking of working at a startup should read.  There is far too much hype, personality and gimmickry it seems around startup hiring much of the time.<p>We're interviewing lots of folks these days and here are some more questions I think candidates should ask or which we've been asked which I appreciate:<p>1.  How many months (or years) of cash do you have in the bank?<p>The founder might not say the exact number of dollars, but they should be willing to give you a # of months/years left esp if they're not revenue generating and are reliant on other people's money (VCs, angels).  If it's 3 or 6 months, I'd think twice as there are no guarantees of funding being raised and do you really want to be job-seeking in 3 or 6 months or get laid off cuz of the Last In, First Out principal? There are no guarantees of more money being raised.  Plus they might be exaggerating about how much they actually have.  If I were a candidate, I'd love to hear 2 years but 1 year at a minimum.  2 years only happens generally if the business is real (making revenues/profits)<p>Clarification:  On the money in bank question, you're looking for real money in the bank now.  Not what they expect based on their projections or if they land that big customer they are ""on the verge of landing"" or the ""we have termsheets from investors and will be closing in the next few weeks"" -- none of those are money, they are promises/hope.  So perhaps the better way to ask this is ""If you earned no more revenue or got more financing after today, how long will the money you have in the bank today last the company?"" -- Also, this is a question you should only ask of a founder, CEO as they'll prob be in the best position to actually answer it.<p>2.  What specific projects do you see me working on if I were to join?<p>This may in all likelihood change by the time you join, but they should have a clearly defined plan for the areas your talents and skills be used.  This will help give you a sense for what you'll be doing as well and whether it's interesting.  I also think if they articulate some nasty, unpleasant work you'll be doing, that is good as well.  Jobs are rarely all rainbows and butterflies so someone who is going to be honest with you about the good, bad and ugly up front is probably better than someone trying to sugarcoat up front with all the amazing stuff you'll be doing every day to ""change the world and make people's lives better.""<p>My only comment on the post is the question about ""What technologies do you want to be utilizing?""<p>Technology enables solutions to problems.  So whether some company is adopting some new, shiny technology is less relevant than whether they're using technology in a way that is solving a real problem and ideally becoming a real, fast-growing business.<p>I think the better question is to somehow gauge their receptivity to being flexible about technology if there is a real benefit to doing so.  Not sure the right question to test for ""technology rigidity"" but that is the question I'd ask if I were a candidate talking to us or any startup.",1324245488

Not only is every cool, important site since 2004 blocked (e.g. Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox...), but VPNs are less reliable than they used to be.  Gmail is unreliable.  Even paying for significant bandwidth, international sites are slow and video is a pain.  I've seen an office full of really smart people's unproductive because they can't load a basecamp page or because dropbox transfers through a VPN move at a crawl.<p>Every time I go to HK, it's like a breath of fresh air having the internet.

difference. He showed masters and weekend

removed it after five seconds, and asked them to 
reproduce the board. Masters could do so with an 
accuracy rate of about 70% compared with 30%

3367588,comment,3367393,3367485,5,0,greenyoda,,,"I think that picking all of your business ideas out of a group that's immersed in a particular technology and culture also has a downside: lack of diversification. There may still be lots of money to be made, for example, in innovative software for corporate IT departments, but nobody in their 20s is likely to be interested in that. From an investment point of view, an undiversified portfolio is risky -- if all of a VC's investments are in social networking or iPhone apps, then a decline in that market segment could wipe them out.<p>Also, a large amount of the low-hanging fruit is concentrated in narrow areas, like web-based businesses. Social networking web sites are something that you don't need a lot of experience or education or capital to be able to build -- some smart guy who has been programming since his teens can drop out of college and do it. But you're less likely to hear about some guy who just dropped out of college starting a successful bio-tech company or figuring out how to design a more efficient car, since you're not likely to be able to pick up too much experience in those fields on your own. This leads to a further lack of diversification the VC world. Not to mention that if everybody is pushing into the same crowded market, they'll all be competing against each other. All this may help explain why, as the article points out, VCs are underperforming the Russell 2000 (a very broad-based stock market index).",1324245119

3367573,comment,3366268,3366268,46,0,ChuckMcM,,,"The answer is 'simple' it comes in four parts;<p>1) Transistors dissipate the most power when they are switching (this is because they transit their linear region). So the more they switch the more power they dissipate, thus the power dissipation of any transistor circuit is proportional to its switching frequency.<p>2) Silicon stops working reliably above 150 degrees C, this is due to thermal effects in the silicon overwhelming its electrical characteristics. One way to think about it is that at 150 degrees C the silicon lattice structure is vibrating so hard because of heat the electrons can't move anymore.<p>3) Lithography and manufacturing techniques have increased the number of transistors per square millimeter of silicon exponentially over the years so the number of transistors has been observed to double every 18 months or so.<p>4) The ability to channel heat from silicon to the outside air is limited by the thermal conductivity of silicon and the ceramics used to encase it.<p>So those four parameters create a 'box' which is sometimes called the 'design space.' If you build a chip that is inside the box it works, if one of the parameters goes outside the box it fails.<p>In the great Mhz race of 1998 clock rates were pushed up which caused heat dissipation to go up, and transistor counts were going up too, so you got an n^2 effect in terms of heat dissipation. The race was powered by consumers who used the single number to compare machines (spec wars). It was unsustainable.<p>The end of that war occurred when AMD introduced multi-core (two cpus for the price of one!) architectures. And Intel had the largest design failure in its history when it scrapped the entire Pentium 4 microarchitecture after realizing it would never get to, much less past 4Ghz as they had promised.<p>AMD proved that for user visible throughput, multiple cores could give you a better net gain than a faster CPU. This side stepped the n-squared problem by having twice the number of transistors but running at the same clock rate, so the heat only went up linearly rather than exponentially.<p>It was a pretty humbling moment for Intel.<p>That begat the 'core wars' where Intel and AMD have worked to give us more and more 'cores'. The heat problem was still there, but it was managed with transistor design since the frequencies were staying flat.<p>Recently, some new transistor designs and system micro-architectures, have combined with the inevitable flattening of performance gains from multiple cores (see Amdahl's law), to give us 'turbo-boost' type solutions, where only one core runs at higher speed (side stepping Amdahl) at the expense of down clocking or even turning off other cores (sidestepping the frequency component of power increases).<p>Another technology on the horizon (which used to be only for the military guys) is SoD or Silicon-on-Diamond. Diamond is a wonderful conductor of heat and so if you make your processor on a diamond subtrate you can pull lots of heat out into an attached cooling system. Get ready for 7"" x 7"" heat management assemblies though that attach to these things. Or alternatively a new ATX type form factor that includes something that looks like a power supply but is a chiller that attaches via tubes to the processor socket.",1324244602

3367544,comment,3367377,3367377,25,0,Daishiman,,,"Unfortunately I cannot say I agree with Vinay completely. He himself lays out the premise that most of the political power is held by the old bureaucrats. I would in fact correct him and say that, at least in Western democracies, it's held by powerful lobbies and economical entities.<p>Neither the lobbies nor the corporations are entities that were ever voted or chosen by the people, and the only thing the last two years of politics in the West have shown us is that it's pretty astounding just how much they can get away with flexing their political muscle without suffering any consequences, even if the power they exert affect the vast, vast majority of the population negatively.<p>What that would imply is that the democratic process is corrupt to a point where supporting progressives is reduced to being merely a gesture; Obama won the elections because there was a certain expectation of correcting many perceived problems of the ""old establishment"". He was unable to fix any of them, and in fact contributed to furthering the power of these interests.<p>At this point, the calculated balance Vinay hints at just falls flat on its face. And while it's true that there are many political powers that are downright illegal and obscure in everything they do (such as the mafias he hints at, and at more contemporary level, some massive drug cartels), the reality is that the institutions that threaten out freedoms act very much legally and partially in the open. And against such institutions, Assange's plan works remarkably well, as evidenced by much of the political action that some of the Wikileaks papers has helped fuel in the past few years. Not only that, but it can still claim a certain level of moral legitimacy that many governments are willing to stand up for, and part of the reason they <i>have</i> to speak openly is because some of the world issues Wikileaks has raised are just too big to keep quiet. I doubt that other, more conventional methods of ""working with the system"" would have gone that far.",1324243954

3367535,comment,3365289,3365289,3,0,alexkearns,,,"My advice on completing projects:<p>Developing a big web project can be a bit like running a marathon badly. You put on a giant chicken outfit. Run around trying to trip over celebrities for the cameras. And nearly die of a heart attack. Okay, maybe that's just me. No, seriously, let me start again. Developing a big... bit like... running a marathon. You are full of energy at the start and set off at a frantic pace. Before you know it, you have the concept design and prototype done. Then you begin to start on the database hierarchy, the sign up forms. This is tiring work and soon your pace begins to slow. But you are still excited by the project so you push on.<p>There comes a point however on most large projects - usually around two-thirds to completion - when your enthusiasm begins to wane. You look into the distance and cannot see the end in sight. There is so much work to do and this work is the boring detailed stuff rather than fun conceptual work. You begin to wonder if the project is any good. You begin to get distracted by Facebook, Hacker News, flash backs of the mangled dying Action Man you threw out of the window with only a paper bag as a parachute when you were a kid (Okay, that's just me again). In short, you are flagging and unless you pick yourself up soon you will be retiring from this race.<p>NEVER GIVE IN
This is usually when a good manager will step in and give his team of developers a good motivational talk (or a kick up the butt). But when you are working on your own projects as part of a startup, when you ARE your own manager, inviting yourself into your own office for a motivational talk does not usually do much good and could easily get you taken away by men in white coats (for me, writing this from Bradlington Mental Asylum, this is no longer a problem). It is easy to give up at this stage. So how do you motivate yourself in such a situation? How do you pick yourself up from the road, and crawl, if necessary, crawl, crawl, until bloodied and weeping, you inch over the finishing line on your stomach, a slimey trail of your inards in your wake (sorry, more flashbacks. My teddy this time. Tug of war with sis. Big Ted never was the same again). Yes, how do you do this...<p>Stop looking at me. Like, I have the slightest clue. What, you were expecting - because you had invested the time to read this far - that I magically would have the answer to one of the most intractable questions in software development - nay, in human psychology: how to motivate yourself and others. Or maybe, if you hadn't quite got the gist of this article, you were wondering how I could help you finish a marathon when, two thirds of the way through, your legs are buckling like a soldier who has taken one direct to the head. To the latter, I've heard that energy drinks are pretty good. Else, take a bus - nobody will probably notice and the money is only going to charity anyway. Later, you might want to invest in some smart drugs...<p>As for the former, get out of here - there's only one way you are going to finish your project, and that is by doing it. So stop reading frivilous articles like this, and get down to some serious coding.",1324243843

But they're nicer apartments with amenities like an in building gym and if you're near Caltrain you can get down to San Mateo or Palo Alto on a train. Palo Alto + Stanford may be a fun day trip.<p>- You're very close to bart and muni there, so really the entire city and east bay are only a 15 minute commute away. If you're in the city for a summer, the Mission and Dolores Park area are awesome if you can snag a place. Great character, cheap food, some higher end food, and a neighborhood feel to lots of it.",1324242755

A younger team would have a lower burn rate, be able to work all hours of the day to get things done (for better or worse), and be more likely to stay with the startup life after several failures.<p>An older team generally needs more of a salary for financial obligations (especially those with a family, mortgage, etc), wouldn't be able to work as many hours (especially those with a family), and might be able to survive a failure or two, then give up and go back to a FT job somewhere because of their already-established connections.<p>Whether you have the same mindset or not, this may be the mindset of many investors in Silicon Valley.

But he showed up at work every single day and made checkins every single day - including Dec 25th and Jan 1st, something he was proud of.<p>I was once at Microsoft campus late on a Sunday and walked past his office. Spotting the familiar blue hue from his office, I looked inside and saw him debugging something.<p>Hey Dave,, I said Ever get bored of ntos and ntos/ke? Youve been coding there forfor like 20 years now?<p>ntos is the core part of the Windows NT source tree and ke is where the kernel code lives in. Where pretty much every source file would have a header with Cutlers name on it and a created date in the 80s.<p>He turned slowly, looked me over. Obviously not very thrilled about this pipsqueak program manager interrupting him being in the zone. He then smiled and said. I love this stuff. What else do you want me to do? Be on a boat somewhere?<p>With that, he turned back to his debugger and went back to work.

To me, it's unclear why you would want to do that. The only thing you have to do to avoid using __main__ is not require any file to be both a script and a module/library. Then just put any entry-point code at the top level of whatever script invokes your program. Unfortunately the __main__ stanza is pretty widely used though.<p>On the topic of modules, there is a wrinkle in requiring __init__.py to be present in any library subdirectory that you want to be part of the namespace.

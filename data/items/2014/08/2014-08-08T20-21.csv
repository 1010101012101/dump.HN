8154922,comment,8153781,8154835,2,0,Daneel_,,,"There&#x27;s a few benefits, the main one being decoupling of the application and the back end.  This way, rather than your application developers needing to know how to talk to the database, they simply use an API to talk to the middleware, which never changes even if you replace the back end database software (moving from Oracle to DB2 for instance). Think of it like a translation service, in this regard.<p>It also helps reduce overhead and latency.  Imagine if you had to constantly write the actions of users to a database in real time for 50000 users, including all the metadata, just so your servers could communicate amongst themselves.  The latency involved would be huge, even with today&#x27;s vastly-better equipment. A fast middleware layer greatly helps to cut down on the data that needs to be written to the back end system, while also improving latency, for what&#x27;s really not a lot of extra complexity. Two birds with one stone, so to speak.<p>This approach also helps you scale - you can treat everything as a node, with the middleware data as distinct messages.  Messages are created and consumed from queues, and so you can have multiple application servers and multiple database servers, with applications publishing messages onto queues for processing, with the database servers consuming these messages if they have the resources to do so.  Adding more capacity to the system then becomes as simple as creating a new database server and telling the middleware it exists - the extra resources are automatically used.<p>Most enterprises work this way.. The basic outcome is that you can start treating the components as a service, with easy separation of duty.<p>There&#x27;s more detail here: <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware</a>",1407530660

The implementation is looked up at runtime. My program compiles, even if I call ``(first 4)``, it will lead in an error at runtime however, since the number 4 is not a sequence.

Maybe the engine is working like an airfoil, displacing the gas locally and using entrainment to create a pressure imbalance with the surrounding virtual particles to cause a larger flow (like in the Bernoulli and Coanda effects).  A broken analogy would be the lift to drag ratio of a wing.  If it’s 10:1, then you can lift a 1000 pound glider by pushing on the tail with just 100 pounds of thrust.<p>Maybe a black body is on par with light pressure because the radiation is concentrated like in a rocket, but other geometries are able to interact more strongly with the quantum foam or whatever you want to call it, because they don’t radiate energy in one direction but instead excite the foam enough that it becomes opaque to radiation and can be interacted with (like what happens when an inert gas becomes a plasma).  Say the thruster excited the foam so that it was moving faster on one side of the chamber than the other, then that would work like the top and bottom of a wing (where the air on the top side moves faster) and create a pressure differential.  The chamber would move to the side with the highest velocity.  This might sound far fetched but there’s some evidence that the wave particle duality can be simplified to particles traveling along waves:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUBaBdl0Aw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUBaBdl0Aw</a><p>Probably what we’re eventually going to find is that empty space is filled with these virtual particles, weighing much less than say electrons, and because of the uncertainty principle, they are spread over large volumes.  So imagine the vertices being shed off of an airliner’s wing.  Even though the wing is only a few feet wide, the vortices might be 100 feet wide, so maybe if you could put special glasses on, you’d see a big vortex being shed around the chamber, and if the foam weighs orders of magnitude less than air, the vortex could be really big.  It’s probably even possible to tie the size of the vortex to the “lift to drag” ratio of the chamber.  Now it doesn’t seem so far fetched that the engine could work when it’s pushing off such a large number of virtual particles.",1407529242

Now, pharma companies inflate the cost of a single drug by creatively rolling in a lot of failures as the &#x27;cost of getting there&#x27;, sometimes warranted, often maybe not so much.  As it is big pharma spends more money on advertising than R&D anyways.<p>Generics manufacturers, incidentally, do just fine, and I can imagine a more sustainable model of pharmacological research where a generics builds up an R&D war chest and periodically discharges it on new research.<p>The hard part is the political intractability of getting big pharma to let go of 20% margins and settle for 5% margins.<p>Edit: error, 10mm only for preclinical, not both.",1407528817

PPOs provide no real value and have basically stuck themselves in the middle of the transaction and inflated costs, which inflates insurance premiums. Getting rid of them would immediately reduce costs quite a bit and make healthcare (and, indirectly, health insurance) much more affordable.<p>I guess the politicians wouldn&#x27;t outright get rid of a whole sector of an industry, though, which makes it harder...<p>When I sold health insurance, one of the things we would often suggest is, if possible, to get a cheap policy with a high deductible and simply put the difference into an emergency fund until you can cover the deductible. This gives you access to the PPO, so you can pay the reduced rates (which are actually quite affordable if you make a decent income!) if something happens, while making the whole thing much more affordable.",1407528563

This represents the database/storage layer of the operations.<p>The part I&#x27;m talking about is the behind-the-scenes communications layer for the application itself - how you pass information between servers in real time with low latency.<p>Think of things as a stack. You have the top layer which is the application. It runs on an individual server as a process, or set of processes. You then have middleware, which is software that handles communication between applications, whether it&#x27;s on the same box, or between servers. Middleware is also responsible for handling communication with the database (oracle in this case possibly). This is the database or information storage layer.<p>Ie: application layer --> middleware --> database.<p>This middleware is the portion I&#x27;m postulating could be using XML, based on my general enterprise experience.

It's $19 to list, but without any of the upgrades, my auction didn't get any traffic.  The prices for the upgrades are $29 for a home page listing, $5-$15 for borders, screenshots, highlighting, or bold, $50 to tweet it to @Flippa followers.  You could easily spend $150 just to list your site, in addition to a 5% success fee if it actually sells.<p>I suspect that some of the sales on Flippa are the same people selling the same sites to each other to inflate the price.  I've seen sever suspicious cases that look like accomplice 1 sells a site to accomplice 2 with accomplices 3-5 bidding up the auction.  Accomplice 2 then does the same thing a few months later to sell to 3, and so on.  The site (originally worthless), sells for $2000, $3000, $4000 among the scammers before being sold to a sucker for $5000.<p>In a lot of cases, it looks like people are buying seasoned domains with high page rank and putting up a quickie site.

Most would <i>love</i> to find a place where they can stay 5-10 years while learning and doing rewarding work.<p>The reason they frequently leave earlier is that they are unable to learn, grow and apply themselves at their present place of work, being in a situation where if they were to stay longer they'd be progressively less useful to employers. The reason younger employees sometimes within a year when they're not adequately mentored and instead keep being used _only_ for maintenance work rather than actual development.<p>Ultimately each hop, each earlier-than-desired departure does give you a better idea of what to look for in your next position (to avoid more hops). It's true that short stays close some doors, but in serious technology companies, hiring decisions for engineers are made by engineers. The hiring manager or company HR may ask you for an explanation of why you've left last several places (and confirm it by checking your references), but it's foolish to pass on a strong developer who made some career mistakes in favour of a weak, but ""reliable"" candidate. Companies that do so aren't the ones where I'd like to work in the first place.<p>The more significant risk to leaving early isn't the messed up resume, it's becoming too anxious and jaded, systematically leaving <i>before</i> being able to apply yourself (e.g., during the training process or when working on a starter project), unable to take advantage of mentoring available.

Show me a piece of invincible software.<p>Even stuff like Java with its top-notch security model and with its managed code has been vulnerable to various zero-day exploits. Even virtualization environments.<p>I have a Windows workstation that's been running for 2 years, with no resident AV running and with the standard firewall. I do have a good AV, but I'm doing a scan every 3 months or so.<p>Never caught anything, mostly because I'm a technical user that knows how to stay out of trouble.<p>Give me a normal end-user using any of those non-MS platforms you mentioned and I'll show you how I can break his computer. Quite simple really ... ""This game needs administrative rights to install. Please enter your password:""<p>Not to mention that the desktop managers running on Linux have serious security flaws that haven't been fixed just because the platform itself is obscure enough for crackers not to bother with it.",1272056552

So to do a compile I would type<p><pre><code>  make; phone\n</code></pre>\nAnd poof!  Instant push notification when it's done.  Or I could<p><pre><code>  ifconfig | grep ether | phone\n</code></pre>\nNo more need to write down those pesky ether addresses to walk across the office and diagnose something.<p>I was considering trying to build a product around it, but decided the market was too small.  I considered OSSing it, but the barrier to setting up a push server, etc., was too high for it to be useful.<p>Now I will retarget my little command-line script to target Notifo over the weekend.

The art part often has a significant component of faith.<p>Moore&#x27;s Law is a good example of faith-based engineering--because we had faith it <i>would</i> happen we committed resources to <i>make</i> it happen.  And that operated well for almost 40 years.<p>I view self-driving cars in the same light--there is now faith that it will happen, so people are now committing resources to make it happen.  And there don&#x27;t seem to be any insurmountable problems (the biggest problems are &quot;vision&quot; being power and CPU intensive, but a car is a very high-density power source).<p>I do understand your point, though, initially many people regarded self-driving cars as &quot;AI&quot; and that, of course, remains elusive.<p>However, what the engineers quickly figured out was that you don&#x27;t need to approach the problem as AI.  There are much simpler heuristics--which is not surprising since driving is a <i>background</i> task for most humans.",1436918227

You can translate someone&#x27;s desires for a product into a software spec.<p>2. You can translate a spec into a real, working piece of software by programming it using your favorite languages and tech stack.<p>3. You can do the above in a reasonable amount of time, reliably and consistently, and follow a project deadline with milestones without too much supervision.<p>4. Your friend is asking for this because he wants to market it as part of a product or service.<p>Great! If you want to be fair to him and give him &quot;mate&#x27;s rates&quot; then charge him $2000 per week.<p>Why $2000 per week? Here is the logical progression:<p>1. You have the aforementioned, assumed skills (which I am deducing from you being a developer of 3 - 4 years) that make you very valuable.<p>2. Your floor for making an iOS app for a client would be $5000 per week. Why? Because it&#x27;s mostly arbitrary and it&#x27;s what the market would pay, and I assure you the market would bear someone of your skills being paid this much money.<p>3. $2000 per week is a vastly discounted rate from the $5000 figure quoted above, which is appropriate for friends. Note that this is appropriate for friends working together as business partners, not for something so insignificant that a friend is doing it pro bono. That you want to be paid at all indicates this situation is not the latter.<p>When I do technical consulting I always bill weekly. I fundamentally disagree with billing hourly for a variety of reasons, so I think you&#x27;re right that you should not be billing hourly.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to bill weekly you can set an entire project fee. In that case, I would take the above amount and multiply it by the number of weeks you anticipate working.<p>What I would emphasize to you is that pricing is basically arbitrary. You simply charge the highest amount the market will bear. If this project is worth doing and &quot;serious&quot; enough to warrant you being paid, you might as well be paid generously, even if it is very discounted for a friend.",1436918046

New Relic uses a 5-minute rolling average for error rates, and alerts when that average goes above some threshold. However, that means that it takes ~5 minutes from a spike occurring to an alert being created - even if the error rate has increased to 50%.<p>It would be much better for it to be doing this sort of outlier detection - a gradual increase in error rate to 3% should not trigger a critical alert, whereas a big jump in error rates should trigger an alert quickly.<p>Has anyone implemented a system like this?",1436918015

9888795,comment,9888153,9888478,0,0,morganvachon,,,"Purely anecdotal, but it happened to me. I had ripped (using iTunes) about 200 CDs I own, over the course of a couple of months of throwing in a CD whenever I wasn&#x27;t doing anything too important otherwise. These 200 CDs were joined by about 10GB of legally purchased MP3s from sources other than iTunes. In fact, I&#x27;ve only ever bought two albums on the iTunes store.<p>Anyway, some time after I had ripped and cataloged all of that old music, I decided it might be a good idea to back it all up to an external hard drive for safekeeping. I hadn&#x27;t really paid much attention to file sizes or anything, but I knew I had about 36GB total. Curiously, after copying to the hard drive, I saw I only had about 25GB on there. This was too big a discrepancy even knowing I hadn&#x27;t really looked at my library before copying. So I dug in, and I realized that the vast majority of MP3s purchased online were missing completely. There was an odd song here or there, but there wasn&#x27;t a complete album (and I almost always buy the whole album in MP3 format) either on the backup or in iTunes itself. From what I could tell, all of my ripped music was there, but it was as if iTunes decided to &quot;forget&quot; that I also had all those purchased MP3s, and somehow had deleted them from my library without asking me.<p>Further investigation revealed that the few remaining MP3s were all available in the iTunes Store for purchase, and almost all the missing music was not available for purchase from Apple. It&#x27;s mostly indie and obscure stuff so that in itself isn&#x27;t surprising, but I found it intriguing that iTunes somehow deleted music that it couldn&#x27;t have sold me. I honestly think that&#x27;s more coincidence than anything, since a small percentage of the deleted music was available from Apple at the time, but it was frustrating nonetheless.<p>The story has a happy ending though: I had previously backed up my purchased MP3s onto DVD-R media, so I never actually lost anything. But that was the last day I ever used iTunes for anything.",1436916803

Google got paid 10c for the ad, but then had to pay Apple 5c to be the search engine.  Same story on Android, except they didn&#x27;t have to pay Apple, but did have to pay to develop Android (1c).  In the iOS scenario they are left with 5c, but in the Android scenario they are left with 9c.  They are better off in the final accounting by 4c because of Android.  Call that whatever you want, but they end up with more money and more profits.<p>The &quot;free stuff&quot; is not free.  It is a place to deploy ads and encourage use of other Google services which then provides more places to deploy ads (aka revenue opportunities).  Even if no ads are involved, the user activity is very valuable.  Knowing what people search for, where they go, who they communicate with etc let Google make better products.  For example when showing search results, which ones the users click on is monitored.  If they keep clicking on the 3rd result then that one should likely be higher.  The more traffic you get the better you can make your search results because the users tell you.  Navigation data tells you what physical places are popular, which again reinforces the search results (eg Chinese restaurants in your town).  Even seeing mis-spellings helps.<p>If you ask people who have tried multiple search engines why they use Google, the answer is usually the quality of the results.  It is a vicious cycle and why Google has 70-80% of search traffic.  Guess where that makes the advertisers go, and the more advertising demand the higher the rates that can be charged.  The positive feedback loops around Google really help.<p>Android does not directly add to Google&#x27;s bottom line.  It does however add over a billion users to Google products, significantly reduces the costs to access those users, does not place those users under someone else&#x27;s control, and helps the revenues of those Google products they use which does show up in the bottom line.",1436916331

For me, it is a level of complexity which cannot be abstracted against. So, for example, it is easy to teach middle school kids to make working digital circuits out of TTL gates, but much harder to teach them how to bias a transistor amplifier to operate in its linear region. Similarly its easy to teach them basic game mechanics with PyGame or something similar but harder to teach them out to develop inverse kinematics and shader based rendering in the Unity engine. All about scale.<p>For me the big difference is that you see a program that does something, and if you&#x27;re skilled enough write your own version that does the same thing, even if it was protected by copyright you &quot;own&quot; that new code you wrote. But if you saw some hardware that did something, and were skilled enough to implement that same thing yourself, if it was protected by patent, you couldn&#x27;t share your version. Sad really.<p>Even an open source RISC cpu couldn&#x27;t be built with out of order execution until those patents[1] expired.

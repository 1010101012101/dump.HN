(Yeah, so that&#x27;s part of my motivation for defending AirBnB.)<p>The answer to the first four of your rhetorical questions all seem to involve some version of &quot;I don&#x27;t want my property to lose value&quot;. Since I have little sympathy for that kind of sentiment, it seems selfish to me for you to force (i.e. legally require) someone else to do this or that with <i>his</i> property just because it might negatively affect the value of <i>your</i> property. As long as your neighbor doesn&#x27;t produce loud noises or obnoxious smells that cross into your property, you have no right to interfere with his use of his property. Would you also seek to ban African-American tenants from your neighborhood? Because, you know, the racial makeup of the neighborhood does have an impact on property values.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not saying everyone should bear with a hostel next door. If you want to live in an all-residential neighborhood, you are absolutely free to go and live in a place where everyone voluntarily agress to HOA rules against business-like activity. All I&#x27;m saying is that this should be voluntary, not a legal requirement, and there are already plenty of places in the U.S. where such voluntary agreements exist. If Manhattan doesn&#x27;t happen to be one of those places, well, too bad.<p>As for the other two two questions, yes, I do understand the rationale for such policies, but I think that they have been corrupted to serve a narrow range of entrenched interests, and that they are badly in need of more flexible rethinking.",1413543073

It was a textbook upgrade for me - zero hassle and everything works just as it should (so far anyway). A couple of quirks I&#x27;ve noticed vs. Mavericks is that a) the animations seem to stutter sometimes - I almost never had that with Mavericks. Perhaps since this is 10.10.0 that&#x27;s to be expected but hope they fix that to buttery smooth in the performance update down the road. The other thing is RAM usage seems to have gone up significantly. I used to average around 2-3 GB used out of 8GB and now I find 5GB used - I haven&#x27;t installed any additional software or tweaked any configuration settings - this is purely a Mavericks --> Yosemite in-place upgrade.

You definitely <i>don&#x27;t</i> want to have a smartphone that looks like crap, hangs up all the time and in the end won&#x27;t let you do half of the things it was supposed to do.

As long as each router knows a &quot;closer&quot; router to the destination, you&#x27;re fine. This is identical to the current setup in that regard.<p>As a matter of fact, it would probably be easier to make dynamic.

In particular, on wireless networks. However, TCP over wireless networks isn&#x27;t exactly great either.

This approach is for the segment of the network that&#x27;s wired routers with little to no packet loss disregarding packets being dropped due to no cache space.

There are companies who love people with degrees from trade schools and others who don&#x27;t like them.<p>When you want to look at working hours in comparison to economical output there once has been a study posted here on HN showing that the richer countries (at least in Europe) tend to be those with fewer working hours and in general there seems to be a strong north-south difference, with Italy, Greece, Austria (which is the exception), etc. having many work hours and Scandinavian having fewer.<p>As for the whole topic: I really don&#x27;t think that all of this really tells you too much about what a good system for economical output is.

Of course it all affects economy, but copying Germany won&#x27;t magically make you rich, same is true for US, UK, China, ...<p>Laws and rules in general, as well as the educational systems must fit with other things like society, natural resources, population size and structure, etc.<p>That&#x27;s also why you can&#x27;t just say that a libertarian (economically, not social) society will always have a wealthier society than another. There are many additional factors. China has the benefit of a large population, the US has the benefit of a great size, over many climatic zones and the UK has at the right time set a focus on institutions that act in the financial market. However also those things have to come with a society that is willing to make use of this.<p>If you think about South America.

If that other side happened to win (could have happened, were they luckier and took different decisions at times of war) then things might have looked different, or not.<p>I don&#x27;t want to say these things depend largely on luck, but since there are multiple complex systems interacting with each other saying X is the reason for this and that everyone could have seen this coming seems like the wrong and a strongly irrational approach to me.<p>There were lots of really tiny events throughout history that strongly affected history and thereby societies, economy, politics, etc. and thereby how well economical models end up working for certain countries.",1413542495

I&#x27;ll leave the moral outrage to others, personally I think $50 for anonymity with tor is great but impossible. Currently I&#x27;m (somewhat hilariously) trying to reverse engineer the firmware in an open source operating system to a product described as 100% open source, but here&#x27;s what I have so far:<p>The source shipped so far is a bunch of config files that appear to be hand-loaded onto devices running an existing image according to a forum post[1]. You would expect to see a firmware image built using OpenWRT the imagebuilder or complete toolchain with some degree of code audit if you want to promise no backdoors.<p>The firewall configuration uses both OpenWRT&#x27;s UCI and a separate unintegrated iptables script. The configuration means that the device will leak protocols other than TCP and UDP with specific destination ports out through the wan interface onto the other network or the Internet.<p>There&#x27;s a hard coded root password in the build. OpenWRT doesn&#x27;t have one and asks you to set your own.<p>The lan side wifi is completely open and unencrypted. If you were to use this device thinking you&#x27;re safe, anyone can sniff what you&#x27;re doing if they&#x27;re within wireless range before it goes through Tor. Because Tor provides transport encryption, almost all .onion sites use HTTP.<p>The device exposes port 9040 on all interfaces, this is the tor socks port. I don&#x27;t yet know whether this could be used to get to the lan side network (e.g. 127.0.0.1 HTTP interface) from tor as I haven&#x27;t looked into it yet by chaining proxies as I haven&#x27;t had time, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s needed.<p>There&#x27;s hard-coded host key material, the startup entropy state is unknown - basically lots of potential crypto problems that to be honest can be saved until we see actual thing and it&#x27;s code.<p>From the config files it looks like the hardware uses kernel modules that load firmware in binary blob form from the device&#x27;s flash memory. This is common in routers and makes kernel upgrades difficult because the blobs are designed for specific kernel versions.<p>The source code for the device&#x27;s OS is not available. There&#x27;s an upgrade firmware available but looking at the firmware using various extraction and carving tools yielded nothing. Some initial analysis shows that there&#x27;s a prologue and a higher entropy possibly compressed or encrypted component. This is not an open hardware platform.<p>Without some serious modifications the device will almost certainly suffer from a transparent proxy leak problem[2].<p>In conclusion the technical claims don&#x27;t match what has been provided at this stage. I&#x27;d be quite happy to discuss things with the developers, but fundamentally this project is not going to deliver the anonymity customers have been told they will even if the security problems are fixed and the source for everything is opened up. I&#x27;m a bit disheartened that they&#x27;re taking the money and going to ship, but I accept that it&#x27;s hard to turn down half a million dollars.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.torouter.com/developer/showthread.php?tid=4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.torouter.com/developer/showthread.php?tid=4</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Transparen...</a>",1413541590

8470199,comment,8467772,8467772,0,0,sergiosgc,,,"This is a sugar-coated version of errors as return values. It fixes the most glaring problem, which is code that does not check for errors, common in C:<p><pre><code>     FILE* f = fopen(&quot;somefile&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
     fwrite(&quot;aha&quot;, 4, 1, f); // <-- Unchecked use of f here
</code></pre>
In Rust (pardon my rust, I&#x27;m totally ignorant), it&#x27;d be:<p><pre><code>    let f = fopen(&quot;somefile&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
    fwrite(&quot;aha&quot;, f)?;
</code></pre>
The compiler would know that fopen may return an error, and forbid me from running unchecked code. Nice!<p>I&#x27;d miss, however, the ability to handle all errors occurring from a segment of code in the same place, stuff that exceptions allow for. Pythonish example<p><pre><code>    try: 
        db = pgsql.connect(localhost)
        stmt = db.prepare(&#x27;INSERT INTO log VALUES(?,?)&#x27;)
        stmt.execute((&#x27;debug&#x27;, &#x27;Note to self: debug logs are noncritical&#x27;))
    except Exception,e:
        console.write(&#x27;Could not write log to database %s&#x27; % (str(e)))
</code></pre>
Sometimes error recovery is the same for all of the segment. I realize one could extract a function for the commonly recovered code, but this may lead to a too-many-small-functions-with-one-caller(tm) smell.<p>Exceptions aren&#x27;t the only way to achieve this. If Rust wants to keep return values as the error mechanism, perhaps it could find a way of allowing recovery to happen in the same place for a segment of code.",1413541236

I was under the impression that people who spend money on consumables help drive the economy, though this might be tangential to the net value to society of each dollar spent. Further, as I understood, taxes on consumables such as VAT, which is how I assume one would go about dealing with that third category of wealthy person, tends to disproportionately impact the poorer in society, at least from what i&#x27;ve read in the news.",1413540422

By default OpenWRT doesn&#x27;t have a root password, and asks you to set one in order to be able to log into the interface or over SSH.<p>A lot of devices running OpenWRT that are shipped these days (e.g. mainly routers of some sort) come with WPA-PSK encrypted wireless network, not an open wireless network. It&#x27;s common to see the password put on a sticker on the device or supplied with it, and it&#x27;s usually algorithmically or randomly generated.<p>Because the default wifi is open anyone in the local area will be able to connect to the device, passively sniff wireless traffic going through the bridge etc. <i>before</i> it hits tor, including any usernames and passwords used to log into the router other than through SSH.",1413540410

Selenium is the bomb when people try to get fancy preventing scraping, how exactly are they supposed to detect the difference between a browser and a browser?<p>Getting banned is not a big deal, plenty of IPs & proxies out there. EC2 is your best friend as you can automate the IP recycling. Even Facebook/Twitter accounts are almost free.<p>Even the randomization wouldn't be particularly difficult to circumvent just save the page and then use a genetic algorithm with tunable parameters for the randomization, select the parameters that yield the most/best records.<p>What I'd actually fear is a system that just silently corrupted the records once scraping was detected, especially if it was intermittent, eg. 10-75% of records on a page are bogus and only every few pages. Or they started displaying the records as images (but I'm guessing they want Google juice)",1337302796

3989880,comment,3989777,3989777,1,0,beagle3,,,"> The exit tax only applies to tax the built-in gain (appreciation) of Eduardo's assets at the time the renunciation is effective, but not to the sale of his Facebook stock itself. In law, little technical details like that matter.<p>Is that describing a different end result than the way I described it? recap:<p>>> on the day that he loses his US citizenship, US-Eduardo sells all his things to Singapore-Eduardo at fair market price. Thus, he pays capital gain taxes up until that day<p>Alternatively, assume US-Eduardo sells it to his cousin Singapore-Eduardo2, pays capital gain taxes to the US, and -- once no longer a US citizen, gives the remaining money back to cousin Singapore-Eduardo2 as a gift, and cousin Eduardo2 gives the shares back to Eduardo (now Singapore-Eduardo) as a gift. Singapore has no gift tax, so this is probably kosher with Singapore (I'm not familiar with Singapore tax law, but I know of other jurisdictions in which this is perfectly fine).<p>There is a complete disconnect between appreciation until denunciation and appreciation(or depreciation) after that date, while the overall effect for everyone involved is exactly the same, and everything is legal in all jurisdictions. Practically, this is what is happening.<p>> The hubub is about the appreciation between the renunciation effective date, when Eduardo paid taxes on his Facebook stock, and the IPO today/tomorrow, when he sells that stock. That appreciation is not taxed by the U.S., nor by Singapore<p>So, it's a hubbub about envy and nothing else. Had he done that a couple of years ago, or a couple of years from now, no one would have cared; or if there was no hype about a 25% increase, which would mean there were essentially $0 to be collected. It's only because people believe that luckily for him, the week his denunciation was accepted (note: he applied for it 8 months ago!), the stock jumped 25%, and that he has a chance to realize that profit next week.<p>> and that is the appreciation that the Senator is attempting to capture with his crazy law.<p>Now it is a crazy law. And just a few posts ago, you seemed to be supportive of measures that would tax saverin better... interesting.<p>> If the value of the facebook stock had gone down between the time he paid taxes and the time he sold, he would have be able to recover that money on his U.S. tax return for 2012<p>That is news and surprising to me. I'll take your word for it, since you are the expert (I just pay experts too much to do my taxes, and don't claim to have comprehensive understanding).<p>But that just means that there's a bug in the tax code that needs fixing:<p>If I'm not mistaken, if you become a US tax payer in september, you don't have to pay taxes for gains earlier that year, and you cannot take credit for losses earlier - only from the date you became a tax payer. The symmetry would require that you should not be able to take credit for losses after losing your tax payer status, just as you don't have to pay for gains after losing that status. Apparently there's a bug, and that's what needs to be fixed -- not introduction of new laws. They have until the end of the year to fix it.<p>Also, if there were no deals in facebook shares that week, the IRS should be able to claim the value was already IPO-high at the day of renunciation, and if challenged, a court might even find that reasonable.",1337302682
3989879,comment,3987660,3987660,1,0,radarsat1,,,"Hm.  The reason synchronization is needed is because the emulator must simulate the chip behaviours over time, and ensure that they act as if they are all behaving in real-time lock step.  Might an alternative approach be to simply simulate each chip <i>independently</i>, in parallel, without synchronization, but ""somehow"" ensure that their behaviour is exactly corresponding to real time, so that time does not need to be ""faked"" by synchronization?<p>Yes, this is probably a recipe for disaster, and I have little idea what mechanism could be used to ensure time accuracy, but just a thought.  (Perhaps an RTOS?)  I also wonder what would be possible with FPGAs, whether programmable logic might provide a better approach to emulating these chips in synchrony.",1337302676

Sometimes they learn that it's the wrong problem for them to tackle. It could still be a great business, but not a good fit for the founders. Prior research can reduce the chance of a ""gotcha,"" but often you must interact with customers to really understand the problem.

But think of the waste of this process from the Lean perspective:  Waiting, Handoffs, Checking, Inspecting, Obtaining approvals, Reviewing, Filing, and Rework.<p>IT groups need shepherds to be able to guide these things through the system of checks and balances.   If you look at this scenario, Ed, the programmer, was the orchestrator.  The end-to-end process was ad hoc, and not designed purposely.  There were actually several processes at play, designed by different departments (IT demand, support, delivery, QA, etc.), with different value systems, and the interaction between them isn't well defined towards the end value of ""shipping software changes that work"".  The division of labour across review, testing, etc., without incentivizing end customer results, and minimizing waste, has devolved into a bunch of school marms that redline all documents or code given to them without actually working to help with the end goal.<p>The ""this test plan isn't good enough"" for example is a near and dear to me.   Why can't QA dedicate a resource for a brief period to help make it better?   Or at the very least, give guidance on the what they want to see for approval?   Usually this (and ornery change management boards) wind up being the primary source of senior management overrides - the QA group doesn't improve quality, it just slows down change thus maintaining the current (functional) mediocrity.<p>IF the process was shepherded by a manager to actively involve QA, Code Review, Change Management, etc. earlier, Ed might be less frustrated, and it would have been done in 3 days. ;)",1337302091

3989795,comment,3989209,3989209,2,0,rogerbinns,,,"Wow quite the mixpanel ad.  My own experience started with Google Analytics which turned sour.  Their Android API only supports one tracker instance and reporting id so you can't have different components in the app using it simultaneously.  While it does support events, it only supports reporting one value with the event.  And it only shows the average for numerical values which is spectacularly useless - you want to see the distribution of the values.  (They also only have two prices - free and $150k per year.)<p>Mixpanel was tried next.  Thankfully you can supply a JSON object of key values with each event (properties in their terminology) which matches our usage model.  Unfortunately the reporting is nowhere near as useful as Google Analytics.  For example there are no pre-canned reports, so if you want to find out anything (eg platform, version and country distributions) you have to build new reports.  (I have the sneaking suspicion it was all designed by architecture astronauts - after all data is data when abstracted as data.) You can't copy reports across projects.  Reports have to start with a particular event name - you can't do them across events (ie any name).  Their realtime view doesn't show any properties.  When doing a multi-dimensional analysis (eg country then operating system), everything except the last one has to be an expression - you can't say slice by all countries then by all operating systems - the country bit would have to be an expression.  They do use geoip to add country information, but won't add region/state or ISP information.  That makes it hard to work with US data.  Their Android code is visible, but requests for an explicit license have taken over a month and they still can't make their mind up.<p>Despite all this, Mixpanel do have one redeeming feature.  You can get an export of your raw data (comically bad mishandling of timezone issues aside).  It isn't real time (generated once a day).  However Google Analytics does not let you get the raw data - only queries.  We have resorted to building our own analysis tools on the exported data from Mixpanel, but are still stymied by lack of geoip for region and isp.  (Yes there have been support requests, no they haven't actually done anything about these and many other issues.)<p>I had considered trying out Localytics, but thankfully this article saved me that effort.<p>Some of the other products like Flurry aren't usable because they also do advertising which is a conflict of interest for our use cases.<p>Some lessons:<p>* You don't really find out the various gnarly issues with any of the analytics services until you are quite far down the road with integration and getting a variety of data back and need to slice and dice things in various ways<p>* Don't touch them unless you can get the raw data back out, not just aggregated reports<p>* Make sure they can coexist in your apps (ie other libraries/components in the app can also use the same service but with a different id)<p>* Make sure client libraries are open source, read the code and make sure there is an actual license attached so you are on solid ground when you need to make modifications (you will always need to)<p>* The various services all suck in some way.  Hopefully someone will come along that doesn't.",1337300832

It seems baffling to consider this from a political/macroeconomic perspective; how would you increase demand but through marketing activity, without your methods becoming coercive or oppressive?</i><p>Wow, seriously?<p>As an extreme example, and something no one is proposing: give all unemployed people a $1 million cash payment. They'll spend at least some of that money, which will create demand.<p>More seriously as an actual example that happened, in December 2008 (during the worst of the GFC) the Australian government made cash stimulus payments to most Australian families. This is credited with stimulating spending (ie, demand) during the Christmas period[1], which of course keeps retail employment high, which in turn puts money in employed peoples pockets etc etc. A second cash payment was made in April 2009.<p>The Australian government also spent large amounts of money on infrastructure projects. Being government, this took longer to spend, so most of that spending occurred right as the effects of the cash stimulus was wearing off. Construction is a big employer, so that helped support employment too.<p>Finally, the (huge) Chinese stimulus[2]  kept the Chinese economy growing, which in turn increased demand for Australian exports.<p>The outcome was mostly positive: Australia was one of the few developed nations to avoid recession in 2008-2010. Unemployment is at historically low levels and inflation is also low.<p>Note that NONE of this was supplier initiated. Businesses were worried and were laying people off, and it was increases in demand via economic stimulus that reversed that trend.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.canstar.com.au/global-financial-crisis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.canstar.com.au/global-financial-crisis/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_stimulus_program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_stimulus_progr...</a>",1337299798

TED doesn't seem to be rushing to pull those down.</i><p>I've never attended Ted, but I've been to a few TedX events in San Jose as a small sponsor.  For Global Warming and some other business issues, I was happily surprised that it had a lot of diverse viewpoints, and that the after event discussions indicated that people were considering these thoughtfully.<p>But I still fear that there is a political correctness at play, independent of the 'partisan' aspects.  Al Gore is welcome as a speaker, and clearly is a partisan giving a partisan speech.  That's good.  But I don't know that Steve McIntyre, who has strong non-politically correct views on Global Warming but is extremely non-partisan, would be welcome.<p>I'm not painting Ted as being left-wing or right-wing, or unfair to either party.  But I worry that if they start playing the game of avoiding topics because they are ""partisan"", the give up too much room to both of the major US political parties to declare topics untouchable.

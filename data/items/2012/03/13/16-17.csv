3699235,comment,3698652,3699168,8,0,illumin8,,,"Short and overly simple answer:  If a program allocates 2GB of RAM, it might not need to use it all right away.  The kernel pretends like it just gave the program 2GB of RAM, but it doesn't really need to flush all those unused pages of cache yet.  It can still use them for other things like disk cache, and when the program tries to access those pages then the kernel will dynamically page them in and out as needed.  This explains why a program might have 2GB virtual but only 128MB is resident in actual physical memory pages.<p>This is overly simple and there are a lot of nuances such as shared memory segments, etc.",1331657748

However, the article is not too convincing about the methodology of excluding marketing expenses.<p><pre><code>    First - and I know that I'm going to hear about this from some people - you might assume that different companies are putting different things under the banner of R&D for accounting purposes. But there's a limit to how much of that you can do.

Corporate accounting statements are generally only accountable to the board of directors, who might be perfectly happy with pushing the limit on creative accounting while the stock goes up.

3699156,comment,3698114,3698114,1,0,dsplittgerber,,,"This article consists of a lot of baseless speculations and conjecture.<p>Under German law e.g. there is a clear difference for an agent provocateur to directly incite specific felonies (""we have to hack company x by doing y"") compared to just generally staying 'within cover' by proclaiming generic plans (""let's harm bad companies""). I don't know about US law, but so far I have not seen evidence of him behaving in the former and not the latter way. FBI would have to have been really stupid to not have instructed him quite specifiy on this issue, and law enforcement is generally not stupid, especially in high profile cases. So don't count on entrapment.<p>Also, who has ever seen evidence that sabu - and by extension the FBI - has ever actually 'hacked' after being turned? To the contrary, the only logs I have ever seen (within indictment), indicate (as far as I can remember) that it was anarchos who did the actual hacking of StratFor. According to the conversatiom logs between sabu and anarchos I have read it seems as if anarchos kept other members of Anon/antisec mostly in the dark as to the details of the operation. On currently publicly available information, anarchos seeme to have done the actual 'hacking' on his own and only needed help (ftp'ing data sets for backup) afterwards. Also note that the FBI server was not the only server the data was transferred to. But providing a server to save evidence and to generally support (but not incite) a crime fits much better with the legal framework for agent provocateurs.<p>Also, one has to remember the general model of how anon operates - it, if by chance, resembles a need-to-know basis similar to military or intelligence operations. Do not assume their 'leader' knew exactly what any one 'member' (of what? Anon is by defintion not a specifiable group, even sub-groups are constantly changing) was specifically up to at any moment.<p>It's also not very insightful to blindly trust the FBI assertion that sabu was caught because he logged onto IRC just once (!) without a proxy. Given that he was always operating with proxies, bouncers and under TOR, and also given that he was publicly 'doxed' wrongly beforehand (but also correctly (!) before being visited by the FBI), why would a single unprotected login lead the FBI to actually following up on the IP and paying the 'IP address a visit', so to speak. It's possible, sure, but is it probable?\nFor me, another possibility is more probable: sabu was a bit too forthcoming with personal, identifiable information when on IRC and chatting with people he assumed to know. Is it only a nice coincidence that laurelai, another member of anon, was visited by the FBI in the months before sabu was turned? Laurelai has admitted to the visit and even to talking to the FBI for hours, but has maintained to not habe snitched. Believable? I don't know - but it's at least more probable as to why they got to sabu. It's also standard operating procedure for the FBI to rely on several informants to get to the big guys. They very often go forthe - more reliable - human intel instead of 'internet logs'.<p>There is a bunch of other stuff which doesn't add up, but probably no one cares. This is why I don't read newspapers anymore. I can make up baseless conjecture and end up misinformed all by myself, thank you very much.",1331656577

I for one don't want to see government in my life.  Their function is to do a few things, do them well and stay as invisible as possible.  This is far from what we have today.<p>Yet I wrestle with this issue of monopolies, particularly when they behave as badly as PayPal, Google, eBay and others  seem to be doing with some frequency.  Because they are monopolies they don't encounter any force that might compel them to fix some of these issues.  Under a normal competitive environment participants would improve their offerings at many levels in order to gain points here and there.  This would include improvements in customer service because this is most-definitely one item that could sway customers to use one service over the other.  Examples of this effect abound.<p>However, once a monopoly takes root the leverage disappears.  The company who owns the market can then focus its attention on activities and policies that benefit them the most.  Customer service is hard and it is expensive.  Internet companies would much rather have algorithms make decisions.  These are cheap and you don't have to feed them.  Here the decision is simple:  If the collateral damage caused by the brutality of a system without any semblance of customer service is but a rounding error in our revenue:  Go forth and prosper.  And that's how you end-up with what we are seeing happen with alarming regularity today.<p>The fact that your business might go down in flames because of their algorithmic decisions is a rounding error in their revenue stream.  Devoid of competition there is no incentive to expend any effort chasing after rounding errors.<p>And so I search for solutions and can't seem to find any.  A startup to compete with PayPal?  Google?  eBay?  Not likely.  Huge barrier to entry.  They are in-effect, monopolies.  It could happen, but I would not bet on this approach.<p>How about a united front of users, bloggers, etc., making a lot of noise in very public ways?  Hmmm.  Well.  If you are in good standing with PayPal and Google, do you want to risk the wrath of the machine and get banned for life?  Because that is exactly what will happen in one way or another?<p>How about suing them?  Same issue.  You almost can't exist on the internet without using services from these giants.  Who wants to risk their wrath?  For example, I'd sue eBay and Paypal in a second if I had the financial support and had a reasonable good certainty of a positive outcome.  They have both caused me damage in the past with unfair unilateral/totalitarian actions.  The problem is that when you look around you can't find a solid way to replace them. I'm willing to bet that thousands upon thousands of people just take it on the chin and move on precisely because of this effect.<p>And so, that leads me to where I really didn't want to go: Governmental action.  The only way to kick these giants in the nuts seems to be to meet force with force.  As consumers of the services of monopolistic companies we have no leverage whatsoever.  None.  However, we do have the ability to get our government/s to take note and take action with overwhelming force.  This is just about the only kind of fight that monopolies are afraid of.  Everything else might very well be an exercise in futility.<p>So, how does one get the ball rolling on something like this?  While I have not been affected at the level that some of these stories relate I've had enough of a taste of how these machines work to be very concerned that one day I could incur tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage because of these unfair practices.  I would prefer to see them corrected before that happens.<p>What's the consensus among HN users?  Is this something worth pursuing?",1331656030

A lot of Java developers are not there yet, and by a lot, I mean most, who are we kidding. I see more shops embracing the JVM as their ""stack"" and the right language for the job mindset on top of that foundation. It's flexible, conservative, and forward thinking at the same time.<p>Play fits nicely into that space and is something that the core team appears to be mindful of.

The Internet 1.0 version would be amazon.com consisting of a bunch of programmers who would hook into the digital infrastructure of manufacturers, logistics providers and customers. Then by applying some fancy math they would be able to provide amazing value to customers who would then shop exclusively at amazon.com. At that point amazon would charge a vig for every transaction on the Internet and become very successful in the process.<p>Needless to say, that hasnt panned out. Amazon has invested huge amounts of capital in its physical infrastructure. Everyone thought they would kill best buy. Best buy is making a resurgence (look at its latest report) and anecdotally I see best buy having better prices than amazon. Internet company price match is now common among many big box retailers (Best Buy, Frys, etc.). Amazon is going to invest a huge amount $12 Billion in capital in the coming months. Co-incidence?<p>So, long story short, it appears that many of the latest internet companies are beginning to realize that you need a deep physical presence to make things work (see Bonobos). You cant just build a fancy website, run some machine learning algorithms, do some A/B testing and conquer the world . Look at it this way, Uber has raised $350 Million.

Having been an investor and an entrepreneur, I certainly agree that VCs miss many good companies and fund many bad ones.

6293858,comment,6292356,6292356,7,0,Chris_Newton,,,"Im all for research and hard data, but I cant help being a little sceptical of these results.<p>We use data: URIs all over the place, typically storing icons and other small graphics as background-image sources in CSS. Over the broadband connection Im using right now (roughly 5Mb/s download speeds) and with a cleared cache, our home page seems to be downloading and rendering in about 1.5s in all of the major browsers, and the lions share of that is downloading the HTML file first and then downloading various standalone images that we havent yet optimised at the end. Over a 3G mobile connection of dubious quality, in the browsers I can readily test with, theres a lot of extra lag up-front, but little difference in the middle section where we download and render the CSS/data: images. These results are both fairly consistent with what weve seen throughout development and testing, across a decent range of test scenarios over an extended period.<p>So while Im not sure from these articles where the difference might lie, I dont see how to reconcile the results weve seen with the idea that switching to data: URIs somehow slows things down by 6x or 10x as reported in the linked article series. I wonder whether either the people doing these experiments werent measuring what they thought they were measuring or perhaps theyve hit an awkward use cases that some/all major browsers dont optimise well rather than a general problem with using data: URIs. The latter is certainly plausible, as there are cases with for example SVG where some browsers seem absurdly slow but everything works with the kind of performance youd expect in others.<p>Meanwhile, data: URIs continue to have some concrete practical advantages for mobile, perhaps most obviously that they tend to circumvent mobile Internet providers helpfully compressing your graphics on the fly so they look terrible on your visitors 300dpi smartphone/tablet display, which is a particular problem with image sprites if their compression starts bleeding one image into the next. For reasons like this, weve found that in practice our decisions about how to send graphics on web pages are rarely dominated by speed considerations anyway  though they surely would be if using data: URIs really slowed down our pages by a factor of 6-10x!",1377742085

6293856,comment,6291123,6291795,5,0,shykes,,,"> <i>There are lots of deployment solutions out there. What there isn&#x27;t is a handy way to manage and track the assembling and customization of your various things-to-be-deployed, independent of the platform.</i><p>Have you actually tried Docker? It does exactly what you describe.<p>Docker containers are versioned similarly to git repositories. You can <i>commit</i> them to record changes made by a running process; audit those changes with a <i>diff</i>. Unroll the <i>history</i> of any container to reconstitute how it was assembled, step by step. You don&#x27;t get commit messages because typically changes are snapshotted automatically by a build tool - instead you get the exact unix command which caused the change, as well as date etc. This means you can point to any container, ask &quot;what&#x27;s in there?&quot;, and get a meaningful answer. In theory that would be true if 100% of all code deployed used rpms or debs. In practice that never happens because developers never package everything that way.<p>You can <i>branch</i> off of any intermediary image. This branching mechanism is used by the build tool as a caching mechanism: if you re-build an image which runs &quot;apt-get install&quot;, it will default to re-using the result of the previous run. Uploading and downloading of containers takes advantage of versioning, so that you only transfer missing versions (similarly to git push and pull), and only store each verion on disk once with copy-on-write.<p>A Dockerfile is a convenience for developers to specify exactly how to assemble a container from their source, independently of the platform. <i>Each step of the Dockerfile is committed, and benefits from the aforementioned benefits</i>.<p>Customization is a special case of assembly: just use a pre-existing container as a base, and assemble more stuff on top.<p>All of this can be tracked, managed and automated as described above.<p>> <i>A deployment tool that did that would become very popular.</i><p>Right. :)",1377742048

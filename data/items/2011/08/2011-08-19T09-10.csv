2902828,comment,2902726,2902726,8,0,extension,,,"Can someone explain the dichotomy between lambdas-as-objects and whatever the alternative is? If they aren't objects, would they be a primitive value with no methods or superclass? What is the advantage of that?<p>EDIT: Ok, I think I'm starting to understand the issue. If lambdas are objects then they have to be typed by their signature. It would have to be a parameterized type i.e. generic. And because of type erasure, the call signature of lambdas would only be known at compile time. So you can't check, at runtime, that a lambda has a compatible signature. That does seem pretty hairy to me.<p>And if they aren't objects, I guess their signatures would be tracked with some sort of new parallel type system that could be better tailored for the purpose. Is that it?",1313747747

2902819,comment,2899018,2901301,7,0,AretNCarlsen,,,"That's true, in the original fable the grapes were inaccessible to the sole character (the fox) and the moral was just that ""IT IS EASY TO DESPISE WHAT YOU CANNOT GET."" Colloquially, however, ""sour grapes"" is often repurposed to describe the rationalizations of a <i>sore loser</i>, that is, when someone else CAN get the grapes but you cannot. That is clearly ellyagg's usage, and as in the cognitive dissonance of the original fable, there is an implication that the loser would change his tune if he were to gain access to the ""grapes"". ANH disagrees, asserting that the grapes are genuinely sour in this case.<p>From <a href=""http://www.bartleby.com/17/1/31.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bartleby.com/17/1/31.html</a> (and it's well into the public domain):<p>ONE hot summers day a Fox was strolling through an orchard till he came to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which had been trained over a lofty branch. ""Just the things to quench my thirst,"" quoth he. Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and a jump, and just missed the bunch. Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, he jumped up, but with no greater success. Again and again he tried after the tempting morsel, but at last had to give it up, and walked away with his nose in the air, saying: ""I am sure they are sour.""

I think it is supremely arrogant to not even mention that it is teaching javascript specifically, making it sound like you could learn how to code in general from the site, when it covers only the most basic of basic topics, and then covers them wrongly. I think it is taking the wrong approach towards teaching someone how to code, in a manner that only someone who doesn't know how bad they are at coding would do. I think people need to understand that learning how to code takes a long time and a lot of hard work. I think the site does too much hand holding and is way too slow .. it is like saying that if you want to learn how to fly to the moon you just have to practice jumping higher and higher, it is like saying if you want to write the next great novel you should keep singing the alphabet song until you know all 26 letters .. it doesn't work and it's giving false hope to people who are not trying hard enough, making them think that they can put in the little little bit of effort that this site asks of them and they will be able to succeed in learning how to code.<p>If I had to teach someone programming from scratch, I would definitely start off with some basic theory of computation stuff, get some basic concepts in on what a state machine is, what are the differences between a deterministic finite automata, nondeterministic finite automota, and a turing machine, then with a basic understanding of what a turing machine is, we can get some C in, learn the basic memory model, what is stack and heap, then gain some basic understanding of typing, difference between static types and dynamic types and why it is important to know about types, which makes so much more sense once you understand what is going on with the heap and dynamic memory allocation and so on, then we can go on to the concepts of abstraction, state change, and so on.",1313746395

It seems more important that he's someone they know would be vocal about it. I'd almost think it'd have done <i>better</i> if he had fewer followers, in that people would be less skeptical of it being just because of his follower count.<p>You're right you can't do this for everyone, though, but giving customers ""treats"" now and again would seem to do wonders. I think the key is that it needs to be a surprise <i>or</i> it needs to be commensurate to what they spend for regular customers.<p>If it's commensurate to what they spend you need to budget and plan for it, and quite possibly should if you're aiming for a high end market, but it may be worthwhile to make some of the perks for regular customers ""surprises"" that makes it seem like you go above and beyond.<p>An up-market brand might have the margins to set aside say 10% for ""stunts"" that makes the customer fanatical about the brand. I don't know Morton's, but an upscale steak house can easily land you with bills in the $150-$200 range for a dinner - it doesn't take many dinners at that cost level before the customer has ""paid"" for a free steak and a 20 mile drive to an airport, and even <i>if</i> such a customer doesn't plaster it all over the internet, you can bet that if my favorite steak house had shown up at SFO with a steak on one the occasions I had to do regular business travel to California, everyone I met would hear about it for a long time. I'd repay a $200 cost or more with extra business for them in a few months at most, probably already on that trip just because it'd be an awesome story to have (as long as they keep their surprises fresh and not too frequent).",1313745265

But, a typical course contains bits that don't change e.g algorithm theory and bits that do , e.g programming skills learned from implementing algorithms, which, back in the day would have been in Pascal or C, nowadays is in Java or Python, and in future maybe some other language. 
So taking such a course would have 2 aims - get a good grounding in theory, and get some buzzwords on your resume / c.v too .

2902732,comment,2902473,2902599,7,0,Protagoras,,,"The normal reason for paying large premiums is that shareholders aren't interested in selling at the current market rate (otherwise in a liquid market they already would have). If you offer a small premium of say 10% investors might just think there is a better deal out there.  Consequently the market value of the company may jump by 15% forcing you to make a new offer of 20% which the market still doesn't accept etc.. until you finally reach a negotiated price. From the numbers side of things this looks better for the buyer because you may end up with a lower buying price. However this way of buying a company takes time and is very messy, giving competitors room to organize to make competing bids or convince the board to split of specific parts of the company.<p>Adding to the normal premiums are the current market conditions and the vast sums of liquid assets large tech companies are sitting on. Firstly the general market is down which usually means shares of healthy companies are ""undervalued"" (difficult to tell if they really are, but that's the consensus). Secondly liquid assets are ""expensive"" to own at the moment, some banks are charging negative interest on large deposits and bonds are sitting at around 0%. If you're a tech company sitting on huge piles of cash this means you want to spend that money on anything as long as it gives more than 0% interest. Shareholders know that companies have a lot of money to spend so they can demand very high premiums.<p>Google bought Motorola mobility at a 63% premium so HP buying at 79% isn't all that strange. I wouldn't be surprised if Apple and Microsoft aren't also considering some big takeovers (GIGAOM reported that microsoft was also considering buyingMotorola) because this is the time to get get rid of those big piles of money they have.",1313744452

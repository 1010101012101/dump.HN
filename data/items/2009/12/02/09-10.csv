The iPhone brought major improvements and some really awesome ideas.<p>SASS brings nothing to the table that hasn't already been done and it fails to even do the standard things better.<p>SASS was a great idea for writing CSS easier. Now it's just a crappy programming language that works with CSS. CSS needs to be made easier, HTML needs to be made easier. Making it a Turning Certified language is no way to do that.<p>Sometimes you need a hammer. Most of the time you don't need a hammer with six gauges and a penis pump. CSS is one of those times.",1259747909

971800,comment,971629,971776,0,0,utexaspunk,,,"I think you're missing Tufte's point. He's not saying PowerPoint is useless- he's saying the way it gets used 95% of the time is useless. Too often they end up putting their outlines directly into their slides, bullet point by bullet point, and insert graphics as a distracting afterthought. PowerPoint makes it really easy to do this, people are lazy, and this is what the audience has come to expect.<p>That doesn't mean slideware HAS to be used that way. Steve Jobs tends to do quite well with it. Tufte himself uses PowerPoint for his conferences. I imagine he'd agree with most of what was said in the article. Keep it clean and visual, as a way of cueing the audience with mental images and (extremely sparingly) emphasizing the keyest of key points with text. It should be a springboard for the presentation and not the presentation itself.<p>Don't throw the baby out with the bath water- these programs were created and has become so popular because they do something people want, and they're the best tools people have, even if they are wielded clumsily.",1259747824

971795,comment,971509,971509,0,0,pierrefar,,,"The numbers are scary: WB claims to be $300k out but they're not accounting for a sizable revenue stream. The post mentions the band earned $12k in 5 years from albums they control, and they expected the albums WB control to earn 2-5X more. Assume 5x$12, and you'll get closer to $200k.<p>Do that over quite a few years, and they'll end up owing the band money while the band members are alive. Keep telling them $62 over five years and they'll never ever need to write them a cheque.<p>How is this not pure and simple theft?",1259747448

They work extremely hard to do the impossible: preserve the perceived value of achievements and leaderboard rankings in the face of an untrusted client. Being the talented folks that they are, they are surprisingly successful.<p>Let me tell you: if your service garners any success (and I wish you the best of luck!) you will encounter widespread cheating. For friends-only leaderboards or achievement lists, this may be an acceptable victim-less crime, but global leaderboards or stranger achievement comparisons will be a problem.<p>Xbox addresses this with ""secure"" hardware, but still faces significant cheating. Constant patrol is needed to fix the broken windows. Do not underestimate then desire of some individuals to ruin the fun for everyone. Just because you don't see why you would want to do it doesn't mean people won't.<p>Good luck :-)",1259746233

971776,comment,971629,971730,0,0,Kliment,,,"On the contrary. A part of the essay is available online, from the linked page. Tufte is very clear that it is possible to have informative presentations - but slideware does not help towards this goal. He argues that slides have a terrible bandwidth, and do not help anyone but the worst 5% of presenters, where they help by imposing structure - any structure at all - on the presentation. All other presenters, he states, would be better off without slides, and should rather just talk, or, better, give their audience their ideas in written form, as sentences made of words rather than slides made of points, and talk about them once they have been read and understood.",1259745695

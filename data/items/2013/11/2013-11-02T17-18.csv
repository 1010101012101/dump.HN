This is the right way of doing things -- like converting your crucial functions to assembly language after doing all your development in C.&quot;<p>I actually have done some basic assembler so I do understatnd the benefits of keeping values in registers, etc.  A lot of stuff really is architecture dependent, of course.

They break it down by time, user, product, incentive, and many more.  Inventory and scheduling decisions track week by week and often day by day.  Anyone using &#x27;magic numbers&#x27; or &#x27;goofy notions&#x27; will quickly be out of business.<p>Also, it is the UI that will really sell the product.  If a user can enter data 5% faster and make 5% more sales, this is HUGE for a retail business.  Furthermore, if the UI is too inflexible and does not allow for enough modification, leading to the business losing or not tracking 5% of sales, this is a huge problem.<p>I really encourage you to study your use cases in depth.

This all feels like instead of studying harder you pay off the schoolyard bully to go beat up that kid you don&#x27;t like because he gets better grades than you do.<p>Rockstar is not just a patent troll, it&#x27;s the Patent Troll King. It&#x27;s much larger, and has vastly more financial backing, most notably from Apple and Microsoft. It&#x27;s nearly invincible (as it can&#x27;t be counter-sued). Plus the case is filed in Eastern Texas, known to side with patent holders.\nBoth companies have much cash in their coffers, and both are feeling the heat from Android. For Apple, the high-end Android devices eat into their margins. While Apple still is very profitable, Android&#x27;s break-neck pace forces them to come up with their own new features or risk looking dated, coupled with Android&#x27;s often better-specced phones that are cheaper than the iPhone. Although brand loyalty is shielding Apple from large shifts, it can&#x27;t afford to sit still. Microsoft on the other hand, is playing catch-up in Mobile after missing the boat miserably, and while the focus should be on making their own products better, they largely seem to have been industrious in harassing Android hardware manufacturers, plus employing some questionable PR-tactics to smear its competition. They&#x27;d both be relieved to see Android wither and die.<p>The tactic at the heart of the battle against Android seems to be the following: increasing Android Total Cost of Ownership by drowning it in patent licenses. This in an attempt to make it toxic to any OEM or potential Android partner (as they have to pay license fees, or could be sued to oblivion if they refuse), all in a bid to make Android less attractive (vis-a-vis e.g. Windows). I don&#x27;t know the might of Android/Google, nor how much strength it&#x27;ll need to face off against the now teamed arsenals of both Apple and Microsoft. If Rockstar can string Android up with enough patent licenses, OEMs will bail, developers will leave and Android revenues will dry up. It&#x27;ll make a Windows license look cheap and safe in comparision. Then Microsoft can return to pointing and laughing at the open-source community, sit back and let their software rot once more as they just eliminated their direct competition. They&#x27;ll have some air fist-fights with Apple to seemingly &#x27;compete&#x27;.<p>What more is Rockstar than a hired gun they can sic on any software outfit that might prove competitive? What if Microsoft feels that Valve&#x27;s SteamBox is getting a little too much traction for their comfort, why wouldn&#x27;t they just send their bully after them? What if Ubuntu can cling on to some larger marketshare when it can smoothly switch between phone and desktop software? Why shouldn&#x27;t Microsoft try and hobble innovative efforts by letting Rockstar make the developers&#x27; lives a living hell? It&#x27;s more than sickening that some Microsoft/Apple fans are already reacting all indignant and holier-than-thou now that their patent lackey has a Nortel patent on search, as if Google stole web-search from them all along, and they only just noticed it.<p>What can counter Rockstar? At what point is this hulking giant too big for the market it&#x27;s trying to disrupt? What stops this beast from going after any open source project that proves slightly popular? How can a developer rest easy at night, knowing that any day a Rockstar lawyer might be knocking on his/her door, and that financial ruin lies ahead? Whether by lawyer fees after a Pyrrhic victory or after being shut down because he/she was found to infringe on something so very basic a child of five years old could have figured it out? John Vesci himself said that &#x27;Pretty much anybody out there is infringing&#x27;, meaning that any company name that gets in their sights, they can take apart.<p>Is that furthering the sciences? Is that what passes for innovation nowadays? As a developer, this makes me sick to my stomach. But the system allows it, and there&#x27;s been too much financial profitability to get this genie back in the bottle, so the odds of reform happening before this warhead hits are slim. Even if it were to happen, it&#x27;ll be thoroughly undressed and defanged before being applied to any case worth its salt.",1383414588

And it&#x27;s hard to say the moral effects are any different when you compare what poverty looks like in China or Bangladesh to what poverty looks like in America. If you start with the premise that all human life has the same value, then the difference between subsistence farming and a sweatshop job in East Asia is a much bigger improvement than you could ever create in the United States.<p>This kind of selective altruism, where you care about other Americans so much that you&#x27;d make comparatively <i>marginal</i> improvements to their lives instead of making <i>drastic</i> improvements to the life of a foreigner, is the moral equivalent of racism.",1383413542
6659919,comment,6659671,6659671,19,0,mililani,,,"I took orgo as an undergrad from a brutal professor.  His name is Marcus Tius, and he is legendary at UH Manoa for being hard.  He got his Ph.D. in organic chemistry at Harvard from EJ Corey.  Most people on here probably don&#x27;t know who EJ Corey is, but he&#x27;s widely considered to be the greatest chemist alive.  And Corey&#x27;s lab is insanely intense.  A few of his grad students committed suicide in recent years from the pressure.  Supposedly, I don&#x27;t know if this is urban legend, but EJ Corey told several others that Tius was his best student ever at the time.<p>Anyways, I just wanted to share a few of my orgo stories.  Our first exam mean scores were in the 20%&#x27;s.  Only 10 of us got above 70%.  There is NO curve in his class.  He talked about this after the first exam, and he said, &quot;Many of you are asking me if there&#x27;s a curve.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to call 90% and above an A.&quot;  The first test was so brutal, that after he called the 15 minute left mark, a whole sea of &quot;HOly shit! WTF?!&quot;  spread throughout the lecture hall.  It was shortly after that, one of the students was escorted out by a grad student proctor because he peed his pants.  I was already light headed from the intensity of the exam, but seeing a guy literally pee in his pants almost made me pass out.<p>In retrospect, orgo isn&#x27;t that bad.  If I had taken it the previous year with another professor who was using the McMurry textbook, I would have even said it was pretty easy.  But, no.  I was stuck with Tius, and I was stuck with an entry level graduate textbook on organic chemistry--this part is no joke.  However, in retrospect, I also realized Tius wasn&#x27;t bad either.  I realized that if I just worked on his assigned problem sets and studied those for the exams, I would have done fine.  The exam mostly consisted of the problem set.  So, he was very fair.  However, all of the urban legend stories made me so scared, I was doing all the problems in the chapter which often took 50-60 hrs a week to complete.<p>For anyone thinking about taking orgo, it&#x27;s really not that bad.  However, like any other course, the professor and books can make it incredibly hard.  Just be wary of that.<p>BTW, I did get an A in both orgo courses.  I majored in math and chemistry, and I have to say, that class with Tius was by FAR the hardest shit I ever had to go through.  And that includes a general chemistry course with another brutally hard chem professor in which I stood up three nights in a row to study for the third exam because I was so behind.  I got an A in that class too.",1383413520

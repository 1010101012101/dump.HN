2702002,story,,,1,0,iusable,"Freelance Co-Founder for Mobile Web Startup",,"Hello Folks<p>I love products and love designing them. I believe that UX is the most important part of any contemporary web application. Products should be created out of need and not ideating in a vacuum. Smart startups are created on products that emerge from features that were once just 'itches' or random ideas.<p>I have one such idea. It arose out of a basic need for me and a dear friend of mine. We both love our iPhones but seldom agree on the apps to get. So we only had one common platform between us - The Mobile Web<p>Instead of raising a round of funding, I decided to build something first, so sketched out what the solution might look like. Showed it to a sample of our common friends & cleaned up the user flows till everybody 'got it'. Then I went about designing it right and tidying up things. We put our heads together and figured out the least amount of things to do to test it - Alpha Specifications.<p>We got another friend of mine to write some code using a mobile web framework that made sense for such a build. In 5 days, we were using our first iteration. It worked, it was wonky, but it worked. In 15 days, our Alpha 'just worked'.<p>Now, I want to take this to the next step. I want to work with a potential co-founder who develops for a living. So, if you get :<p><pre><code>    Startup level rapid development
    Focusing on User Experience to win over users
    Ten Real Users > 10,000 pageviews
    Weekly feature releases using

    LAMP
    Node
    Socket
    Mongo/Redis
    HTML 5
    PSD/JPG -> XHTML
    Google Analytics
    Slicehost

</code></pre>
Then, let's talk.<p>I am looking for somebody who can commit 90 days. I will guarantee the following:<p><pre><code>    100 real/active users for our product
    $1,000 per month
    $2,000 bonus at the end of the contract, if all = well

</code></pre>
If this goes well, we can sit down and negotiate how you would want to proceed. I am open to paying you at a higher rate or doling out real equity in a real product startup.<p>I am 100% self-funded and I have done this before, I know what it takes to actually ship products to real people. I am more than willing to pay more, but I want to know that this is a decent idea and have a solid technology partner who can bring it to life. It takes about 60-90 to release an early-stage product and finesse things well enough for end-users.<p>I am not going to be the 'right fit' for most on here; that's good! I want that one person who just gets it - if that's you, I assure you I will do whatever it takes to make this the best product developing experience of your career so far.<p>Thank you for reading.<p>p.s. I love this community.",1309193978

2701998,comment,2701636,2701636,11,0,niels_olson,,,"I understand how quite a few game hackers would be in favor of a ruling like this, but if these are truly your convictions, I would like to see some video (not screencast, video) of your 12 year-old son playing some game with his mostly nude, thoroughly adult female character slavishly hacking on the corpses of other characters. Is that normal?<p>I was in an ethics discussion in my military surgical program and started to see how the effects of these policies. Full disclosure: a number of my friends have died in the current conflicts, starting with the Pentagon on 9/11. One of the situations we were posed with, by staff who were there, was this:<p>CIA officers approach you, as a doctor, in Kandahar, with a captured informant-turned-double-agent. They want you to give him Ativan so he'll talk. They tell you he knows where a weapons cache is that could be used against Americans. You say no, there's no medical indication. They say, if you don't, they'll torture him and get the information anyway. You're role will only cause him more pain or less.<p>The overwhelming consensus of medical students, interns, and residents was to give him the Ativan. Three of us took the opposite position: you can't let people cajole you into making moral decisions based on threats. Then your just complicit.<p>The irony was that the majority consisted of essentially everyone who hadn't thought about these problems before. In the minority of three were two of us with prior service, and the philosophy major.<p>Here's the point: video game violence develop a shitty moral compass. It's just shit. I don't care if it points in the right direction or the wrong direction. I, your comrade in arms, don't know where it's going to point next time. And that's not the guy I want be sharing a tent with.<p>So enjoy your expanded access to an audience willing to pretend they understand violence. Moral consistency matters. Reliability matters. You can look forward to further international embarrassment when they grow up to make the wrong, randomly wrong, decisions behind the trigger or, worse, at the voting booth.<p>Edit: Look, I'm all for the first amendment. I took an oath to defend it, and I carry a copy of the Constitution with me everywhere. I read it regularly. Genuinely, I support the ideas in the opinion. My concern is that waiting in the wings around this particular opinion, there's a lot of unscrupulous adults salivating over the opportunity to take money from my kids in exchange for making my job as a parent, doctor, military officer, etc, harder.<p>Edit 2: For those asking for evidence: here is the American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement on Media Violence, which includes abundant (3500) references if you would like to dig deeper: <a href=""http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/108/5/1222.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/108/5/1222.ful...</a><p>Preview of that statement: ""The strength of the correlation between media violence and aggressive behavior found on meta-analysis is greater than that of calcium intake and bone mass, lead ingestion and lower IQ, condom nonuse and sexually acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection, or environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer.""<p>Edit 3: I would like to point out that here is a thread full of programmers justifying, essentially to themselves, why their industry is best off with less regulation. Do you extend your arguments to other industries gray areas? Meat processing? Tobacco? Defense? Isn't ""corporate self-regulation"" best for everyone?",1309193916

2701977,comment,2698442,2698727,2,0,dkokelley,,,"I really wonder how dictionary attacks will progress as word frequency and distribution is studied. ""this is fun"" has 11 characters, which has 3<i>10^15 possible lower-case combinations, and (using the 500,000 word dictionary), has 1.25</i>10^17 combinations, an order of magnitude more. But, assuming a smart hash cracker, the size of the dictionary could be shrunk considerably. I believe most people use approximately 10,000 common English words (not including proper nouns or fictional words). 'this', 'is', and 'fun' would all show up under that scheme. Using a 10,000 word dictionary, there are only 1*10^12 combinations. Much less secure than an 11 character random password. A smarter cracker could apply sentence structure rules to skip odd, fragmented sentences (ie. ""dog foot with happy"").<p>Also, the article failed to mention the risks of compromised password databases. Sure, the attacker could just gain access to the actual files he or she wants while bypassing the login step, but the list of username/email and password credentials are a major threat to users. Most users only have a handful of passwords, and an attacker could leverage the one they know to find the ones they don't. Password managers are necessary for this reason, to provide unique passwords to each protected site. If password managers become wide spread, then why not let them remember arbitrarily long and complex passwords. It can't hurt, right?",1309193671

2701972,comment,2701342,2701904,1,0,breck,,,"> Can multiple stones occupy the same square?<p>You're right I should have clarified. If multiple stones could not occupy the same square, the odds would remain as I first explained them (3x, etc.). I think in my stones analogy and real life, stones should be able to occupy the same square. In fact, there should be a positive correlation (ie, given that there's a rock in this square, odds of a second rock being there go up).<p>> How is it appropriate to equate/compare ""the number of squares you walk through in order to pick up all the stones"" to ""the number of times a digit should show up""?<p>The odds of coming across 3 units of a quantity are 3x as hard as coming across 1 unit. When we write numbers, we are either:<p>1) writing a truthful description of how many units we see/own/ate/taste/touch etc. (I ate 2 bagels, I earned $5, I ran 10 miles.)<p>2) lying.<p>By ""lying"", I'm including things like writing a novel. Maybe a better word is ""imagining"". With numbers, we are either writing down true observations or we are imagining them. It's just as easy to ""imagine"" $9 million in your bank account as it is to ""imagine"" $1 million, while truthfully finding $9 million in your bank account is a lot more difficult :). This is why Benford's law doesn't apply for ""imagined"" numbers. By using Benford's law, you can quickly classify a number set into either ""real"" or ""imagined"".",1309193562

The OP downplays the importance of who those apps were created for, when that is a fundamental part of the design process. Both Eclipse and NetBeans are just as designed as Coda, but not for web developers. Take the Refactor menu in Eclipse, for example: it feels like someone is saying We know how miserable you feel that the code sucks right now and how hard it is to improve it. Here, have these amazing tools and fix it. For a Java developer, having a refactor do in seconds what would take a whole day <i>definitely</i> has emotional implications in the visceral, behavioral and reflective levels. If that does not resonate with the OP, well, thats because he doesnt have the same sensibilities and issues a Java developer has, not a inherent fault of Eclipse.<p><i>[O]ver 80% of Linux kernel contributions are made by corporations, so its reasonable to infer that most open source software is built to feel an internal corporate need. Consequently, interaction design is underrepresented in open source.</i><p>While its certainly the case that open source has a lot of interaction design issues, the who-what-why-how of the kernel are not the cause. The Linux kernel is the least user-facing component of the typical OSS stack. As Linus points out in an excellent chat with Greg Kroah-Hartman, there is very little left the Kernel developers can do to help the typical user. The problem is in the userland.<p><i>Part of the problem is market. To be blunt, commercial software needs to sell, and usable interfaces are an integral part of that.</i><p>OSS needs to sell, too: it must be adopted by a community and, in some cases, it must find a corporate sponsor. One may argue that OSS <i>projects</i> are started to solve the problems of a single person, but the ones that become <i>products</i> must have seen wide adoption. Good interaction design is, just as for commercial software, another selling point. At the same time, terrible user experience is democratic. There are loads of unusable commercial and open source software available.<p>What open source really needs is not (just) designers, but <i>design</i>. Good design can only happen when people with a strong hand, a vision and any kind of design sensibility are in charge. And thats true for any kind of software product, not just OSS.<p>. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__fALdvvcM0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__fALdvvcM0</a>",1309193396

We've been overwhelmed by the interest in SocketStream and the number of people who've already started experimenting with real-time games, wikis, and more.<p>Unfortunately the video cuts off at a crucial point: The last slides talks about how we want to do testing and scaling differently, and in particular how SocketStream is still <i>highly experimental</i> and subject to a lot of change in the future as we learn more and refine our ideas.<p>After playing back the video I also want to clarify the reference to Gmail I made at the beginning. We have shown an early version of SocketStream and the websocket concept to an ex-Googler now at AOL who's been involved in many projects at Google, including Gmail.<p>He loves the idea and mentioned he would let the Gmail team know about it as the '100% websocket approach' potentially solves many of the problems they had wrestling with AJAX and long polling. We would certainly welcome their thoughts and contributions, along with everyone else's. We have some big problems to solve in this space and are the first to recognise we can't do it all alone.<p>So please go forth, have fun, and see what you can create. We are already hard at work on the next version which will include support for the new features in Socket.IO 0.7, plus a website for SocketStream containing full documentation and an 'live' API guide. Please follow @socketstream for other exciting developments coming soon.",1309193288

2701890,story,,,1,0,brmancinelli,"This little piggy",,"This is about the first and fourth little piggies. I am sure you all have had all five piggies counted, pulled, wiggled and tickled to that familiar poem we all heard as kids. You remember don't you?<p>This little piggy went to market,
This little piggy stayed at home,
This little piggy had roast beef,
This little piggy had none,
This little piggy cried,
""Wee-wee-wee!"" All the way home.<p>As startup piggies you want to make sure we are like the first piggy as you go To Market and not be like the fourth piggy who Had None. All too often, we get that big idea and rush to market before we take time to define and measure the market that we are planning to dive in. Rush to market too quickly and you might find yourself in the wrong market or worse yet, find that literally your little startup piggy that went to market ended up as pork chops, ham hocks, hot dogs or sausage or the other pig by products. When that happens that leaves  entrepreneurs just like the fourth piggy; left with none.<p>Let's take a look at industry and market more closely.<p>Make sure there are an industry and a market for your big idea. If there is a known industry, then do your market research on the market potential for your idea and when a market already exists it is much easier to predict and share so that others will believe how big the market really is. The Internet, trade associations, the Small Business Administration (SBA), Department of Labor, local business groups, county and state economic development organizations, the library, government reports, market research firms, and market-specific consulting firms are some of the readily available sources of data. Market intelligence, metrics and market segmentation, and support information can help define and quantify the market for your big idea. Your local chamber of commerce and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are valuable sources of market intelligence. When you go out promoting your big idea you want to be received as a well informed expert in your space.<p>If you believe that you must create the market for your startup you will find that effort much more demanding of your time and resources.<p>You want your big idea to have a very big potential. The bigger the market potential the better it is.<p>Netscape founder, Mark Andreessen once put it this way: Ill assert that market is the most important factor in a start-ups success or failure.<p>Netscape was a first big Internet search idea targeted at a market in which there were already big players ready to protect their market presence and offer similar product services as those being pioneered by Netscape. This did not prevent Netscape getting immediate traction in that market space but it did have a bearing on the ultimate outcome on Netscape. While Netscape was not the ultimate winner of the browser wars it understood the market and was a huge success for its founder and early investors.<p>It is one thing to start, support and grow a company and make a name for your product or service, but it is an entirely different thing to create a new market. Markets evolve over time. Whether it is a broad market segment or a niche market that you plan to penetrate, make sure the market exists at all. Consider the impact from market segments that might closely overlap with the market you are addressing. Otherwise your message will be lost or easily duplicated by an established player in the direct market segment or in neighboring markets. Product and service positioning are shaped by the markets in which they are operating. Understanding the market will shape all the early business decisions for your startup. Once you are successful in the market you and your company will shape the decision process of future startups looking to jump into your market. But by then, you will be a market leader.<p>Not all market industries are equal. Consequently, not all industries offer the same potential for start-ups and small businesses. Certain industries present better promise than others.<p>The magazine Start-Up (Summer 2009) provided insight into better and poorer performing industries. They listed the ten best- and worst-performing small businesses (with annual revenue growth of $15 million) by sales growth over the most recent twelve-month period. The best-performing industries were:<p>-Religious organizations (25.1%)
-Farm products, raw material merchant wholesalers (20.6%)
-Gasoline stations (15.2%)
-Support activities for agriculture forestry (14.2%)
-Direct sales establishments (12.5%)
-Accounting tax preparation, bookkeeping /payroll services (10.9%)
-Computer system design/computer related services (9.8%)
-Offices of other health practitioners (9.5%)
-Industrial machinery and manufacturing (9.2%)
Schools and instruction (8.4%)<p>The worst-performing industries were:<p>-Offices of real estate agents/brokers (-12.8%)
-Home furnishing stores (-10.7%)
-Lumber and other construction materials/ merchant wholesalers (-8.4%)
-Automobile dealerships/merchant sellers (-7.3%)
-Activities related to credit disinter-mediation (-7.3%)
-Wood products/manufacturing (-6.9%)
-Motor vehicle dealers (-6.6%)
-Cement and concrete product manufacturing (-5.7%)
-Clothing stores (-5.7%)
-Furniture stores (-5.5%)<p>It comes as no surprise why these industries are aligned as they are, given the overall economy during the measured period. With the housing-credit market implosion, the financial market collapses, and the disasters in the auto industry markets, the worst performing small businesses would come as no surprise to anyone running a business this last year. With gasoline prices seemingly quoted by the hour, worries about personal and professional finances, layoffs and the need for career changes and the like, it was a great period to be pumping gas, retraining Americas workforce, and trying to put your arms around financial investments. Given that the best performing industry was religious organizations, we can all agree that the recent economy has had everyone worried and on their knees.<p>What is interesting, however, is exactly how quickly those good and bad industry segments realigned. Until recently there were always market warning signs and time to react to industry shifts and changes. Today, small businesses have to be prepared to see their industry change dramatically and react to that change with appropriate operational business swiftness. Additionally, we have learned just how dependent on one another many of the market segments have become. When the housing market declines, so does home furnishings, real estate brokers, wood, concrete, and other building materials providers, furniture stores, and financial mortgage providers.<p>Even looking at the venture investment market, where current investments are made to market segments designed to have a five-to-ten-year investment horizon, the overall number and total dollars of investments were substantially down from prior recent years. The following industries were still identified in Entrepreneur magazine identified the following market segments as still having favor in the venture capital investment market. Their March 2009 magazine gave us this list:<p>-Software
-Biotechnology
-Media and entertainment
-Industrial/energy
-Semiconductors
-Information technologies
-Network and equipment and...<p>...Business products and services, computers and peripherals, consumer products and services, electronics and instrumentation, financial services, healthcare services and retail and distribution were closely grouped together.<p>So let's try that little verse again:<p>This little piggy went to market - Make sure you understand it and that you can be successful in it.<p>This little piggy stayed home - It can be an Internet home based startup but it still needs to be in the right market at the right time.<p>This little piggy ate roast beef - Watch cash flows and have enough to feed your startup. Being in the wrong market or having to create a market will chew up all your ""roast beef"" (funds).<p>This little piggy had none - Avoid being in the wrong market or even worse yet being in the wrong market at the wrong time.<p>And this little piggy cried, ""Wee, wee, wee"", all the way home - Be in the right market at the right time and you survive and you will likely be crying out your success all the way home.<p>Want to read more.

If he places your wife in a job, don't be surprised to see him leveraging this in the worst way possible if things don't work out as expected.<p>2. You are maximizing a stake that isn't yet worth anything, and may never be worth anything. 20% of $0 is $0, just as 25% of $0 is $0. Perhaps a better way to look at this: figure out how much this venture would need to be making before the total value of your compensation package (equity and any eventual salary) would exceed what you're already making now at your six-figure job. The number is probably much larger than you think it is.<p>3. If your compensation is stock granted outright for services, you should be aware that this may create undesirable tax consequences for you. You should speak with an experienced accountant about this.<p>4. The fact that your friend needs to continue working to fund the venture is a huge red flag. What if he loses his job? What if he has a medical emergency? What if his wife divorces him? If you're going to get in bed with an ""investor"", he should be putting in most if not all of the cash up front. Which begs the question: if your friend says he's prepared to invest $15,000/month for 10 months, is he capable of transferring $150,000 to the new company tomorrow? It doesn't sound like it.<p>Again, the risk you're concerned about is a result of the fact that you are pursuing a deal structure that makes no sense.

Pulling out of the US, I would imagine, would constitute insanity to most shareholders.<p>On a second point, I don't even believe Google should have pulled out of China. This is clearly a moral judgment on my part. Baidu has replaced Google in China, and their censorship is just as bad, if not worse, than what Google would've been subjected to. I've been told that <i>not doing anything, is just as bad as doing something bad</i> - and I believe it.

It is 3 times as hard to find all 3 stones as it is to find 1 stone.<p>Now imagine that numbers are built out of stones. To ""build"" a 1, you only need 1 stone. But to ""build"" a 2, you need 2 stones. Thus, if you wanted to write a 3, you would have to go in the desert and find 3 stones. It's 3x as hard, and so you'd expect people to ""build"" 1/3 as many 3's as 1's, 1/5 as many 5's as 1's, and so on. Just as you'd expect there to be a lot more single story buildings than skyscrapers. It's easier to build a single story building.<p>Thus, the distribution is exactly what you'd expect. While it doesn't actually take stones to build numbers, we don't write the number 3 unless we have 3 of something. Unless you are lying.

You start by stepping in square 1, and to get to square 10 you have to step through each square.<p>If there is only 1 rock, what are the odds that you'll have to walk all 10 steps to find it?  This is the same thing as asking what are the odds that this rock is in square 10. The answer is 1/10 or 10%.<p>Now, if there are 3 rocks, what are the odds that you'll have to step into all 10 squares? Well, what are the odds that there's a rock in the last square? 26.1%, or approximately 3x as hard. It's interesting that it's not exactly 3x as hard, it's 2.61x as hard. Which makes the data in the OP seem even more logical since you'd expect 30.8% 1's given 11.8% 3's--the 32.62% actual number is not that far off.",1309191148

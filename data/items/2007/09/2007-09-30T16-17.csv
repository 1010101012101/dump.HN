61309,comment,61217,61217,0,0,axod,,,"I agree...
I like facebook for 2 reasons:
It lets me find old friends I've lost touch with, and it shows me what they're up to every now and then.<p>The rest of the crap (Feeding virtual fishes, 'poking' each other), they can keep.<p>The whole 'myspace' mentality of 'requesting friend' then adding ad infinitum - I think that's the weirdest thing. People who religiously seek out 'friends' to add etc. When you have hundreds or even thousands of 'friends' they become meaningless.",1191171494
61308,comment,61217,61217,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I've got to admit feeling more and more disenchanted with FaceBook and MySpace.<p>
There's a difference between addictive and useful. FaceBook is addictive, but are all those people really my friends? (Real friends are people who will help you move furniture) Isn't it a lot like the devil spawn between a phonebook and a gossiping game?<p>
LinkedIn to me seems a little more honest. It's there for business purposes. FaceBook looks just like a huge time sink. A online video game designed around human's social instincts.<p>
Hey. I'm old and probably don't get it. I like to spend my time doing things that have impact in the real world, even if it's programming or engaging in discussions. What does FaceBook do? Exist? Perhaps there is some new kind of socializing and friendship that's being created with Web 2.0. Fine. That makes sense. But the individual still has to do the cost-reward work. At the risk of being branded a heretic, I'm afraid ""Do something users want"" might be incomplete, at least from a consumer's standpoint.<p>
Note that I'm talking about FaceBook and MySpace exclusively. The whole ""how many people can you actually physcially relate to at any one time"" is a different question entirely. Discussion boards, especially good ones, seem to me to be a different animal.",1191170891
61307,comment,61222,61222,0,0,uuilly,,,"I think apple quality control has gone downhill in the last few years.  I've been an apple customer on and off for a long time.  And I've been totally on the day they went back to OSX.<p>1) The wireless on my MBP has been an on and off disaster.  When I first got it, wireless transfers from machine to machine were way slower than my old PBK.  When I click the wireless signal button to choose a network it takes a full second+ for the networks to show up.  Used to be instant.  Their latest wireless driver (their 4th version!) dropped me from my network every 15 minutes requiring an archive install to get back to the last version.  Wireless on my PBK was NEVER a problem at all.<p>2) I got the airport express for my parents a few years ago.  It almost never worked.  The music would incessantly drop out and no amount of network settings tweaking would fix it.  Magically in Tiger the problem disappeared.  <p>3) When the latest airport extreme came out I HAD to have the airdisk feature.  I've had an old G4 tower as my file server and itunes repository for a while and it was annoying to move around.  But my recent experience taught me to wait.  I routinely monitored the forums and it turned out that the airdisk wasn't even close to ready for prime time.  Hundreds of messages were posted about dropouts or their disk not even working at all.  It took two firmware updates for the forum complaining to subside.  I now have it and it works but...<p>4)  If I leave my house w/o dismounting the network drive, the machine hangs for a full minute before it says the drive was disconnected.  30% of the time I wait two minutes and have to hard reset.  On my PBK it was a consistent 15 second wait w/o ever having to hard reset.  <p>Perhaps there is something rotten with the wireless engineers at apple.  But really a bit of testing should have smoked these problems out.  It used to be unusual for something to come out of apple so rough around the edges.<p>As for the iPhone, I really love mine.  I haven't had time to play with the hacks and I'm glad I didn't.  But I went to the iphone hacks sites yesterday and saw how prolific the extra apps had become.  This phone only came out a few months ago and they have lots of useful apps with mature package management systems.  It was sad to see such a promising developer community squashed at the dawn of its life.  ",1191170822
61306,comment,61255,61255,0,0,cstejerean,,,"this is a really cool concept at least when searching for people. After searching for my name it gave me a list of sites that have my name in them (usually mailing lists) and in the related email addresses section the first 3 email addresses were mine. The other two were people that I have talked to on some mailing list. The site is REALLY slow at the moment but I'm hoping these are issues they can work out.<p>Do they actually crawl the web for this or do they do some sort of searches in the background (it does take a long time to get the results back)?",1191170771
61305,comment,61217,61278,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The fact that Facebook is not as ""rich"" as face-to-face interaction is a feature, not a bug.<p>Live interaction is great, and we will always enjoy it, but it doesn't scale: you can't go to the pub with more than a handful of friends at a time. If you take a group of fifty people out to the pub you will obviously have to break into a bunch of little sub-groups. If your two best friends end up in different sub-groups, you will either have to ignore one of them or pursue the ""mingling"" strategy: talk to one small group for half an hour or so, then stroll away on the pretext of getting another beer and wander into another small group.<p>The ""live interaction"" version of your Facebook page is your wedding reception. Now, I enjoyed my own wedding reception, but I also have to say that I wouldn't be anxious to hold another one. The good news is that I got to see many of my relatives, my high school friends, my college friends, my grad school friends, my music-playing friends, and my wife's relatives and friends. The bad news is that I talked to each of them for exactly two minutes before moving on to the next. Since I was the guest of honor, I was socially obligated to mingle rather than stick with a single small group, so I ended up exhausted and vaguely unsatisfied.<p>The ""live interaction"" version of news.yc is a technical conference with several hundred attendees. The good news about a conference is that nobody is obligated to try and talk to every attendee, so you are free to break up into managable little groups. The bad news is that if you're eating lunch with your colleagues in one room while DHH, PG, RMS, Woz, Bill Gates, and Al Gore are engaged in a passionate technical conversation in another room, you may never realize what you were missing. Even if you spot the PG table, you may find it rude to simply abandon your colleagues mid-lunch in order to go over and kibitz. And there are both physical and social limits to how many people can listen over PG's shoulder.<p>",1191170653

61303,comment,61277,61277,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think the 2 year cookie policy affects GMail. I remember being prompted for a password every so often even if I tell Google to keep me signed in. I'm guessing the 2 year cookie is for correlating search results. And even if the cookie itself has an expiration 2 years in the future doesn't mean that GMail will accept that session ID.<p>Can anyone confirm whether or not you can stay logged in to GMail for 2 years using just a cookie?",1191170286

Did they steal just the computer (if so what are all the references to the backup device)? Did they steal just a backup device? If so shouldn't the data exist on the actual computer itself? Or was it not really a backup but more of an archival device?",1191170048

For most accidents, these numbers are fairly equal to ""unlimited"".<p>About health insurance - I'm not quite sure how you come at the conclusion that state pays everything.

3999084,comment,3998813,3999004,6,0,nextstep,,,"It hasn't been too long since I was starting college.  For freshman (in the US at least), colleges encourage students to try lots of classes and take their time picking a major.  Many schools don't require students to declare a track until they are in their sophomore year -- halfway through a four-year program!  Many can be completed in 2-3 years (even ""hard"" majors, like physics), and the schools design the degree programs with this buffer so students can wait to make a decision.  Of course, the schools don't mind recieving four years of tuition for an education that could be completed in three.<p>But it's easy to blame the schools.  In my experience, students don't really make career choices (like picking a major) by weighing the economic costs and benefits.  Our current culture in college encourages students to take on massive amounts of debt regardless of their field.  For many liberal arts degrees, this is probably a foolish financial decision.  But for many college freshman, the apparent difficulty of a subject is considered thoroughly, while the job prospects of a career path are a secondary consideration.",1337529250

I know this. I tried. I tried very hard.<p>I don't own a car myself, but since I often rent a car when I travel, I decided that I'd try to buy a third-party liability policy instead of paying the absurd prices that Avis or Dollar charge (>$20 a day).<p>I called about 10-15 insurance brokers, and not one of them had ever written a ""non-owner"" policy. The standard answer I got was, ""You have to own a car to get liability insurance; yes, it'll cover you for other vehicles you drive, but you have to have your own car for us to create a policy for you"".<p>I realize that you are in the UK, so the situation might be different there. But in the US (and Canada), I think that RelayRides would have to be the one to provide the coverage, because the average RelayRides user (who likely lives in the same city and doesn't own a car) won't have his own liability insurance (and couldn't get it even if he wanted it!).",1337528936

On multiple occasions I've seen engineers categorized into ""product builders"" and ""problem solvers"".  Problem solvers like the difficult problems and once they've solved a problem they get bored and move onto another.  If you have a directory of unfinished projects on your machine, you probably fall into this category.  The product builders see difficult problems as barriers and just want to get them solved.

Instead of reading long tutorials rather give yourself a small task like a mircosite or a chat (the typical Node standard example) and build it. I would start with a plain and simple site. Later you should dive into  some packages. Highly recommended are Express, Jade, Stylus for a quick web app. Then deploy the thing to Nodejistu with 'jitsu deploy' (or another Node hoster).<p>Step 1 takes 1 hours and step 2 takes 1-2 hours and after that you realize the power and ease of Node and the great ecosystem in form of the npm and its modules.<p>Next steps are getting into more great modules like Socket.io and trying MongoDB with the native driver (then you rethink web development entirely).

However, you are downplaying the risks.<p>The different sources of the SMS may not cause alarm. The victim may not go back to original message to verify the numbers. Many companies have multiple legitimate phone numbers. The phisher may try to find phone numbers that are variations of Google's so the user is less likely to notice.<p>The phishing page could be secure in the sense of having SSL and looking professional. I haven't use Google's SMS verification, but I'm hoping that the text they send raises red flags about only entering the code in Google's web site. If not, e.g. if it's just the code, I could very easily see a victim entering the code into a legimate site. If Google's SMS does have warnings, the attacker could get a domain like <a href=""https://gmailgiftcardverification.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gmailgiftcardverification.com</a> that may still get some victims to enter the verification code.<p>I think this is more dangerous than page directly phishing for a google password.

Aid organizations want to help refugees, and are generally willing to give warlords money in order to be allowed access to those refugees.<p>This was a big factor in the start of the Congolese Civil War.  In Rwanada after the the genocide the perpetrators fled into Congo and many Hutus, fearing that the Tutsi forces would want revenge, fled with them.  In the Congo the genocidaires were able to confiscate and resell part of the aid, and charge rent to aid agencies, and use the money buy weapons to arm the people there in the hopes of retaking the country.  The new Tutsi Rwandan government, not willing to let this happen, decided to invade.  And since Mobutu of Zaire had been harboring insurgents from all the other neighboring countries, they all decided to help.  Thus began the Congo Civil War.  However, rereading the section in Wikipedia on the refugee crisis it seems that  Mdecins Sans Frontires and most of the other independant aid organizations were smart enough to realize what was happening and leave so they couldn't be used - and it was the mostly UN that was still contributing money and supplies when the fighting started[2].  So maybe you should give money to aid organization after all.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse</a>

Kanker adalah suatu kelompok dari banyak penyakit-penyakit yang berhubungan. Semua kanker-kanker mulai di sel-sel, yang membentuk darah dan jaringan-jaringan lain. Secara normal, sel-sel tumbuh dan membelah untuk membentuk sel-sel baru ketika tubuh membutuhkan mereka. Ketika sel-sel tumbuh menjadi tua, mereka mati, dan sel-sel baru mengambil tempat mereka.<p>Adakalanya proses yang teratur ini berjalan salah. Sel-sel baru terbentuk ketika tubuh tidak memerlukan mereka, dan sel-sel tua tidak mati ketika mereka seharusnya mati. Leukemia adalah kanker yang mulai di sel-sel darah.
Sel-Sel Darah Normal<p>Sel-sel darah terbentuk di sumsum tulang (bone marrow). Sumsum tulang adalah material yang lunak dipusat dari kebanyakan tulang-tulang.<p>Sel-sel darah yang belum menjadi dewasa (matang) disebut sel-sel induk (stem cells) dan blasts. Kebanyakan sel-sel darah menjadi dewasa didalam sumsum tulang dan kemudian bergerak kedalam pembuluh-pembuluh darah. Darah yang mengalir melalui pembuluh-pembuluh darah dan jantung disebut peripheral blood.<p>Sumsum tulang membuat tipe-tipe yang berbeda dari sel-sel darah. Setiap tipe mempunyai suatu fungsi yang khusus:<p><pre><code>        Sel-sel darah putih membantu melawan infeksi.
        Sel-sel darah merah mengangkut oksigen ke jaringan-jaringan diseluruh tubuh.
        Platelet-platelet membantu membentuk bekuan-bekuan (gumpalan-gumpalan) darah yang mengontrol perdarahan.
</code></pre>
Sel-Sel Leukemia<p>Pada orang-orang dengan leukemia, sumsum tulang menghasilkan sel-sel darah putih yang abnormal. Sel-sel yang abnormal adalah sel-sel leukemia. Pertama, sel-sel leukemia berfungsi hampir secara normal. Pada waktunya, mereka mungkin mendesak sel-sel darah putih, sel-sel darah merah, dan platelet-platelet yang normal. Ini membuat darah berat untuk mengerjakan pekerjaannya.<p>Obat Kanker Darah Herbal:<p>Obat Kanker Darah Herbal,- Pengobatan kanker darah ada berbagai macam cara diantaranya, pengobatan kanker darah dengan laser, pengobatan kanker darah dengan obat kanker darah [kimia], pengobatan kanker darah dengan kemoterapi dan lain sebagainya.

I appreciate the emphasis on real-world economics and on the costs of vendor lock-in. I haven't yet completely digested your results numbers to see how they inform my business, but I definitely will.<p>It's too bad that you weren't aware of, or didn't cite, Tahoe-LAFS when you wrote that paper! Even though you used my zfec library, which I created (by copying Luigi Rizzo's feclib) for Tahoe-LAFS's use. Heh heh heh.<p>I tried to get Tahoe-LAFS's existence registered in the official academic research world by publishing this: <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=7212771373747133487&as_sdt=4005&sciodt=0,6&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=7212771373747133487&...</a> but it didn't really work. Most of the subsequent research that probably should have cited Tahoe-LAFS still didn't.<p>Perhaps that 5-page paper was too telegraphic to communicate a lot of the important properties.

However, it can also serve effectively as a replacement to the forms/reports/tables system utilized by access and base. (as well as many other things, but we won't discuss that formally tonight) No prior knowledge of Drupal is required, and for those who do understand drupal, we will go through using cck and views, as well as a few other modules to develop a replacement for a small access database.”<p>Since this is a Windows Blog, it appears to be off target – however since it’s a emotionally-detached example to illustrate what is also seen with Windows stuff.

1888302,comment,1886492,1887922,0,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""Debt is only an insecurity if your income is insecure.""</i><p>For the vast majority of the population, income <i>is</i> insecure. I think that's part of what the author is getting at: by adding debt insecurity, one disproportionately seeks to make their income more secure.<p>i.e., Taking less risks, doing less things, and generally trying desperately not to rock the boat, and being less happy as a result.<p>> <i>""A renter with a long term lease holds just as much obligation as a home owner as far as that goes.""</i><p>I'm not aware of any rentals with 25-year leases. Most leases I've ever signed have been 12-18 months. Also, the mortgage payment on an equivalent place is, in my experience, >2x the rent. I can lose my job <i>right now</i> and pay off the rest of my lease without breaking a sweat. Heck, if you're really paranoid about it you can insure yourself against it.<p>On the same income, all other expenses be equal, etc etc, a renter has a lot more free cash flow than a guy paying a mortgage. Not only that, he can pivot much more easily, since his obligations are dramatically much more short-term. It's both easier to build the rainy day fund to pay the rest of his lease off <i>and</i> he's able to cut down his costs much more quickly than, say, trying to sell off your house that you can no longer afford.<p>This translates into real-life in major ways. People who are mobile, have few obligations have <i>much</i> more firepower at any negotiation table. When you can walk away to a better gig in another city and have your bags packed in 3 days, you can extract much better results.<p>Which isn't to say renting/avoidance of long-term obligations is always a good idea, but IMHO it's a <i>very</i> good idea while young. Your income curve will be steeper due to your ability to negotiate, and you will have much more freedom to find the life you're looking for.",1289343053

Anyone who has been through a metro public school system has more than enough anecdotal evidence to know it's not race (and NOT the school), but the culture and family the kid goes home to at night that makes the biggest difference.<p>While I agree with the idea of picking specific metrics and asking about them, at a cultural level I think what is going on here is a little more complicated than simply not knowing.<p>Frequently public schools teach things that the subcultures feel are simply not relevant, to their lives.  Let me give you an example:<p>When I showed up for day 1 of high school, I was immediately bombarded with the idea of applying to college.  I was essentially told that the next four years would be spent preparing for college - that's what the ""point"" of hs was.  This in an of itself is pretty bad, in terms of limiting intellectual exploration and all that good stuff.<p>But imagine you aren't planning to go to college.  Imagine no one in your family went to college, and it's likely you'll end up working a blue collar job where your degree doesn't matter.  What exactly should your parents be doing/saying here to get their kid interested in school?

You can get a PC with the same hardware specs as a Mac Pro for about half the cost. You can also get a PC with the same specs for about the same cost if you get one of the gamer brands, but just a Dell or HP Quad core machine is far cheaper than a Mac Pro, assuming all things that can be compared on an apples to apples basis are the same.<p>In notebooks the price disparity is not quite as large, but it's still large. You'll get about the same notebook for $800 that you'd get for $1,200 from Apple. Also, stuff like RAM upgrades and SSDs cost far more for the same thing. Again though, you could find comparable Windows units for about the same prices, or at least close, if you went with higher end notebook brands.<p>Second, in phones the price disparity is still large because of Apple's deal with AT&T. They're getting not only the $600 unsubsidized prices, but some extra fee as well taken from the contract. You might argue that AT&T is paying that, not you, but your bill may be higher as a result, or you may be on AT&T rather than Verizon since VZW wouldn't agree to that, etc.<p>Even in tablets, competitors definitely can match the iPad's prices.

1888184,comment,1887510,1887951,0,0,ktsmith,,,"> The majority of people/groups I see selling Drupal stuff sell themes which I see as legitimate... It takes a lot of work to make a well-written theme<p>It takes an equal amount of time and effort, and in many cases significantly more, to make a module. As a developer it's hard to argue that the time spent isn't worth something. If that project is the only project worked on by a developer continued work and development may not even be possible without charging for the software. Certainly their work can then be redistributed for free, but that's a risk the developer can choose to take and offset with value added services such as official support for the module. When the module doesn't work for someone that got it for free they then also have the option of turning away support requests from that person or trying to sell them support. I don't see how this is any less legitimate than making themes.<p>> Isn't the point of using software like Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, et al to be a part of a larger Open Source community?<p>I've been involved with a bunch of open source projects and the majority of the users don't really seem to know or care where the software came from. They care that it works the way they want. The fact that it's ""free' is a bonus typically but many would willingly pay for it. That's part of the reason Red Hat makes money and other companies supporting open source make a lot of money.<p>> I know I would never sell a module or theme rather than release it to the community, because that's what's been done by my predecessors in the community.<p>That's great, and that's a choice that works for you. It likely doesn't work for everyone. One of the nice things about the GPL is that it allows each end user of the software to use it as they see fit so long as the same rights are extended to the next person it is shared with.<p>> There's a good thread here <a href=""http://drupal.org/node/237682"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drupal.org/node/237682</a> discussing just this and the general consensus seems to be that it's possible but generally harmful to the community. I think this applies not only to Drupal but to every Open Source project in general.<p>Unfortunately that thread, like so many others, is filled with a lot of incorrect information about the GPL and it's very hard to find the valid information within all the noise. Selling open source software has worked extremely well for a large number of companies. There are and have been numerous companies that have helped grow open source communities and projects through their charging for open source software or addon services. Red Hat, Cygnus, VA (Research/Linux/Software/Whatever they are this week), etc.<p>I would recommend reading the gnu.org page on the philosophy of selling open source software. One of the key lines is:

I tried finding an on-line solution to the problem, initially the one which would simply take all the new items and convert them to RSS.<p>I couldn't find one, so I built one myself, using some simple node.js scripts and adding the feed into Google Reader.<p>Having RSS feed in compact view helped a lot, nearly cut the reading time in half.<p>The next stage I see is grouping the messages into categories, and presenting the categories in the order of importance. Say, all the news first, then RTs, then social stuff like 4sq/twitpic/yfrog etc.<p>I think that the service should allow viewing tweets in real-time (using twitter's SiteStreams API) as well as having an ability to expose the categories as RSS feeds.<p>However I am as blind and subjective as anyone else is, so that's why I am asking you to point out some obvious deficiencies of the idea.<p>Also I'd like to get your help in identifying the important categories of messages and ranking them in this short survey<p>http://is.gd/gSCvo<p>Thanks a lot!

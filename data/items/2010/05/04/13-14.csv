It's been _years_ since Chrome made it on the scene and the response from Mozilla is still abysmal; Firefox is still at least twice as slow than Chrom(e|ium) for me. Firefox's UI is still clunky and huge and slow; dragging tabs takes forever and breaking them out forces a page refresh (bad when watching videos etc).<p>If Mozilla doesn't want to get crushed by Chrome they need to put together a serious response and fix their issues. The only thing keeping users on Fx would be extensions, but equivalents are quickly showing up for Chrome. Mozilla is going to completely lose its relevance if they don't get real about fixing things.<p>I started up Ubuntu 10.04 and was disappointed to see Firefox as the default browser.

From nature's perspective the point is presumably that if you can still breathe, you should be able to reproduce :)<p>If we were to put the same level of effort into a file reading module, we would have the files replicated over 10-15 different systems with file reading code written by a dozen different people in a dozen different languages, all using different heuristics to locate a similar file (or a backup) if the original wasn't found. Add some sort of selection mechanism to pick the best result from the 10-15 return values, and you would have a very resilient file reader :)<p>I can't imagine we will ever want to write code like that by hand - drawbacks include development cost and maintenance hassle, and the system becomes very hard to understand and debug.<p>But it's still an interesting approach.

They saved on a single buffer chip that would have avoided this and the design was 'fixed' in the next release.<p>Software should not ever be able to 'damage' hardware beyond slightly accelerated wear, such as when ordering a harddrive to repeatedly seek across the whole drive and so on. Tricks like that should not result in stuff burning up or dying, if it does that is just bad design.<p>The wear on the flash ram is just whatever it would be if you packed that number of writes in to a much longer amount of time and the li-ion battery discharge would simply mean that you get the same number of cycles but over a shorter life-span.<p>That doesn't count as 'physical harm', after all, then normal use also causes 'physical harm', it just takes longer.",1272981344

So here is what I would like to know: When Apple is NOT involved, what are the reactions? Not just of the company and reporters, but people who don't really have any stake in it?  I am genuinely curious how much of the ""apple did nothing wrong"" crowd is just apple fanboyism, and how much of the ""gawker was in the clear"" crowd is just anti-appleism.<p>Another thing I would like to know: Gawker returned the phone when apple finally admitted the phone was theirs. During the denial stage, why would anyone be responsible for returning property to someone who claims ""that isn't mine"". Forget apple: if someone sees a $100 bill at my feet and says, ""Hey did you drop that bill?"" and I say ""Nope, not mine"", I can't later claim ""that guy stole my $100!"".<p>Final question: since apple did get their property back, why are all these people outraged? A large number of them have probably downloaded leaked movie/tv/music. Many of them have railed against IP law in the US. But now that it's Apple they are talking about the ""terrible damages that come from Apple not getting to talk about the phone on their own terms"". I call shennanagans.",1272980753

1317907,comment,1317381,1317381,0,0,goodside,,,"I'm not convinced this explanation-by-analogy style is really all that helpful, particularly with regards to ""the big bang is an expanding balloon"". What makes it such a confusing analogy is that most people were already picturing something like an expanding sphere anyway, just one filled uniformly with matter moving away from a central point as it expands. And it doesn't reinforce that the Universe has no center, since most people can easily imagine what the center of a balloon is.<p>So, screw the analogy. Here's what we know.<p>Right now, everything is moving away from us in proportion to its distance from us. Read that again, because that's <i>the</i> fundamental observation. The usual intuitive view that lay people have is that we're drifting away from the Big Bang on inertia left over from the explosion. This would <i>not result in what we see</i>. For everything to move away from us in direct proportion to its distance, everything would have to be speeding up all of the time. When we're distance d from the Big Bang, we're drifting away from it at half the speed that we are when we're distance 2d away. Inertia doesn't do that. So much for inertia.<p>Maybe it's not inertia, but some kind of Magic Inertia that we don't understand? A kind that pushes things faster and faster as time goes on, like little angels perpetually flapping their wings to add momentum to every atom. That's great for a while, but you hit another problem: the speed of light. If you're already moving away at (nearly) light-speed, you can't double your speed. Doubling your momentum will just give bring you infinitesimally closer to light-speed. D'oh.<p>So what is the answer? The closest you can get without worrying about math is probably this: Space is being created, and distance is somehow being inserted in the gaps between everything, and this happens continuously and everywhere. The other, more accurate, way to see it is that the <i>meaning</i> of ""distance"" and ""duration"" (that is, the <i>metric</i> we use to determine the distance between points, both in space and time) is itself changing as the Universe expands.<p>This results in some observables that cannot be explained otherwise, and which we do actually observe. In this model, everything (at intergalactic distances) does indeed increase its distance from everything else, and in direct proportion to the original distance. Since this is a change in the spacetime metric, rather than actual movement within spacetime, it does not result in relativistic effects that you would see if it were literal movement. There are galaxies in the sky right now whose distance from us is <i>literally increasing at a rate that would be impossible if it were due to movement, since it would require movement faster than the speed of light</i>. That's the clincher--the reason no other model can possibly work.<p>This ""metric expansion of spacetime"" maybe sounds like a cop-out, like something's been invented just to explain the Big Bang, but it hasn't. This is <i>exactly</i> what matter does in the normal scales of planets and stars. The changing of the spacetime metric is what gravity fundamentally is, as Einstein explained with General Relativity. It's the reason clocks run slower on Earth than they do in space, and it's the reason the planets stay in their orbits. It's all really just quite ordinary.",1272979437

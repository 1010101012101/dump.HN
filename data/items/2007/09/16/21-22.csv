I've seen a lot of bad software released under this banner.<p>On the other hand, that's an awful long time for the features I see in a really crowded market.",1189979957

But its function will last as long as there's a server to host it.<p>So if his next project turns out to be that way, then ten projects thereafter, pretty soon he's made a suite of applications that a large number of people find useful.",1189979864

55395,comment,55381,55381,0,0,aston,,,"If your services are already parallelizable to the degree that they could sit on separate VM's, couldn't you just run them side by side on the same machine without all of the extra overhead a VM gives you? Maybe this is a Rails-related problem, but in general the hard part is not the move from parallelized tasks on one machine to many. The big problem is taking some non-parallel code and trying to distribute it much later on.",1189979402

The issue, ultimately, is building something heavily dependent on some other company's platform. I guess you could argue YC wouldn't want to gamble by trusting not one company, but two. Then again, Xobni's sitting on top of Outlook, and we know how much PG dislikes Microsoft. And Loopt is tailgating, at least for right now, on Boost's platform. <p>Ultimately, I think YC will fund any enterprise that looks like it can make some money. ",1189979243

When there's a fine line between winning and losing, an edge received dishonestly (what the defense is going to do) can make all the difference.<p>Maybe that's why there are so many Microsoft bashers.  Not because they're so big.  Not because the software leaves much to be desired.  Because they cheated so often when almost everyone else played by the rules.  (Don't believe me?  Send me your source code - if we like it, maybe we'll do a joint venture.)\n",1189978538

55381,story,,,20,24,martin,"Virtualization: good idea for startups?",,"In a presentation he gave (slides at <a href=""http://brainspl.at/xen_and_the_art_of_rails_deployment.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brainspl.at/xen_and_the_art_of_rails_deployment.pdf</a>), Ezra Zygmuntowicz, the founder of Engine Yard, suggested that folks hosting web apps should base their infrastructure on Xen virtualization from the ground up, with a separate VM for each service. In other words, you start with one physical server, on which you have a web server VM, a database server VM, an email server VM, etc. Backing up your server configuration is now as easy as copying over one (albeit large) file, you can more easily isolate performance issues within your application's dependencies, and when you need to start worrying about scaling, it's a cinch to move a resource-hungry VM over to a new machine, boot up a new web server instance, etc.<p>I'm just curious whether anybody's tried hosting their app in a virtualized environment like this, as well as what people's thoughts are about this in general. Is it a good idea? Is Xen stable enough and is the performance good enough for this to work? Is it premature optimization for a startup not having scalability issues yet to be doing something like this, or do the other benefits help make it more justifiable? Would this really be all that much more work to set up compared to running all the services on a single box anyway?",1189977073

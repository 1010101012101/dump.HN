I couldn&#x27;t but agree with every single sentence you&#x27;ve written (though I haven&#x27;t worked at SF)!<p>I almost fell into this trap while I was <i>inspired</i> to work for a super cool team within a bigger company; a la start-up within a giant. I, unfortunately, got inspired enough that I ignored my new born, didn&#x27;t see him grow up. I realized that I was being played just in the nick of time (after an year).<p>Irony is that now I&#x27;m in a real start up for almost two years and these two years have been best years of my life, both professionally and personally. I get to work on something that&#x27;s really challenging and rewarding and at the same time I get to spend a few hours of high-energy time with my son, wife and family (I also am very active reader).<p>All this just because I figured out how to balance by spending sane hours at work and work at home late night once in a while when everyone is asleep!<p>My take away from this experience is; after your needs are taken care of to a comfortable extent never trade time for anything. Not for money, not for equity not for anything. Especially if you have a young family. Watch your child grow spend time with her; children develop emotional attachment by the time they are 5 and it only comes with spending time.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t have family don&#x27;t trade your time; go see the world, read something new, learn something interesting.

Things like plotting the distribution of cookies so you can see if they are backed by a good RNG.

If they could have their risk diversified/averaged out in the same way that VC does, they&#x27;d be happy to have it that way. You could connect young talent and passive capital in a way that doesn&#x27;t involve so much onerous interference.<p>VCs are an unnecessary and mostly counterproductive middleman between passive capital and young, poor talent. They take a huge cut, almost no real risk, and make enormous sums of money while others do the work.<p>VCs who gave their founders more autonomy would have better performance on the market. The problem is that they&#x27;d have fewer executive jobs to give out to their friends. The purpose of the forced fast growth (beyond the obvious) is to create needs in the company for executives under extreme time pressure. &quot;Oh, you need a VP of X? I&#x27;ve got one for you. Now, just let me see which of my less successful friends I owe a favor...&quot;<p>Passive capital and young/poor talent need to find each other and VC is about the worst system for making that happen. It leads to abuse of the talent and to crappy returns for those with the passive capital. But the VCs get their 2-and-20 and a bunch of executive-level positions to hand out to underachieving friends from MBA school, so the system persists.",1400687803

The spec in Android is complete crap and largely ignored by the hardware vendors. In Windows and linux you get the complete OS from the OS owner (MS, or ubuntu or red hat etc...) and each driver has to match the spec exactly or the driver will fail, with Android you are getting custom forks of the OS. Each one is customized to the hardware and has a different behavior.<p>In short it&#x27;s MUCH easier to support different hardware in the PC world because the OS vendors have standardized the specs and in Android it&#x27;s very wild west, each hardware vendor is supplying their own version of Android which is mostly the same but has subtle but key differences.",1400687616

However, I struggle with it when implementing RESTful web services. Letting the process crash will typically yield a 500 - the monitor on the connection process in the web server library ensures that. Clearly though, a status code and some additional information is a more appropriate response to the client. An example is returning a 400 for &quot;missing arguments&quot;. In a contrived example of idiomatic Erlang, I feel like I&#x27;d write this:<p><pre><code>    handle_request(Request) ->\n        % username and password are required\n        {ok, Username} = request:get_argument(<<&quot;username&quot;>>, Request),\n        {ok, Password} = request:get_argument(<<&quot;password&quot;>>, Request),\n\n        UserRecord = db:find(my_database, users, #{<<&quot;username&quot;>> => Username}),\n \n        Password = maps:get(<<&quot;password&quot;>>, UserRecord),\n\n        request:respond(200, UserRecord, Request).\n</code></pre>\nAnd if the key username did not exist in Request, request:get_argument/2 would return undefined or {error, Reason}, giving me a bad match error. Or if the password didn&#x27;t match, I&#x27;d get the same. In order to intercept that and return a reasonable status code, I would have to catch that in handle_request. My question, then, is am I missing a best practice on how to handle this? Or is this just the place where I do need to catch errors and process them? And if that is so, isn&#x27;t it at odds with the whole concept of writing intentional code?",1400686426

Hence, existing\ninstant messaging services for mobile phones share indicators of\navailability, such as the last time the user has been online. However,\nin this paper we not only provide evidence that these cues create social\npressure, but that they are also weak predictors of attentiveness. As\nremedy, we propose to share a machine-computed prediction of whether the\nuser will view a message within the next few minutes or not. For two\nweeks, we collected behavioral data from 24 users of mobile instant\nmessaging services. By the means of machine-learning techniques, we\nidentified that simple features extracted from the phone, such as the\nuser&#x27;s interaction with the notification center, the screen activity,\nthe proximity sensor, and the ringer mode, are strong predictors of how\nquickly the user will attend to the messages. With seven automatically\nselected features our model predicts whether a phone user will view a\nmessage within a few minutes with 70.6% accuracy and a precision for\nfast attendance of 81.2%&quot;</i><p>Thirty Second Video for ACM CHI 2014<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbyxOHZF1E8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbyxOHZF1E8</a><p>ACM CHI 2014 Paper Citation:<p><a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2556288.2556973"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2556288.2556973</a>",1400686400

7778772,comment,7777831,7778649,2,0,sillysaurus3,,,"Very true, and that&#x27;s a solid theory.  Unfortunately I&#x27;ve learned from experience that the market rarely follows anyone&#x27;s theory.  The simplest example: many moons ago, when people were trying to explain bitcoin&#x27;s meteoric rise in price, the general consensus was that the price was linked to (or at least influenced by) Silk Road, because Silk Road was the only practical use for bitcoin.  Then Silk Road collapsed, but bitcoin&#x27;s price hardly moved.  Theorycrafting is fraught with dangers like that.<p>I noticed from some brief experience with bitcoin trading that if people suspect a huge downward plunge is happening presently, then people with a lot of bitcoin will step in and start putting up &quot;floors&quot;, i.e. a large buy order about $50 to $100 lower than the current price.  So they might offer to buy 1,000 coins for $75 less than the current price, because they expect it to plunge.<p>However, when it actually does plunge, what happens is that the plunge eats into their buy order to the tune of about 50 BTC, and then they cancel that buy order and move it even lower.  This makes sense because if there&#x27;s downward pressure, you stand to earn even more if you adjust your &quot;floor&quot; as far down as possible in order to buy the cheapest coins.<p>So, if 200k coins are sold off all at once, it seems like most of the big players in the market will set a &quot;floor&quot; of about $50/BTC, then sit back and watch what happens.  And since everyone else will be completely panicking at that point, a significant number of people will probably hit &quot;sell at current market rate&quot; in order to get out of their BTC position as quickly as possible.  (I&#x27;ve seen it happen; sometimes huge orders of 1,000+ BTC are sold at current market rate, which plunges the price way down, and then the price ticks back up as the market adjusts.  But 200k BTC is two orders of magnitude higher; it seems like that will smash the price all the way down to sub-$10.)<p>Hopefully whoever is in charge of Mt. Gox&#x27;s assets will take a more nuanced approach to selling off 200k BTC than &quot;put them on Bitstamp and sell at current market price.&quot;",1400686320

They are working on their own fight--and yes, there is still largely internalized ignorance of race/gender-identity/ablism and beyond within the movement, but that does not mean they should completely abandon progress just to appease someone that thinks it is only &#x27;perceived bias&#x27;.

Most of us could earn enough money to support our family comfortably in a relatively regular 9 - 5 job. We might not be personally as satisfied and we might not be as financially well off, but we can choose one possible version of our life over another.<p>I&#x27;m currently in the 9-5 job and maybe I&#x27;m just a whiner, but I feel the same as this guy. I hate the commute through rush hour traffic that I am required by the time window to make. I hate that once I get to the office I sit in a 8&#x27;x8&#x27; cube, with two 8&#x27;x4&#x27; desks taking up 50% of the space. I hate that I&#x27;ve just been reassigned to a new cube, same size, same desks, but now with a structural 4x4 pillar taking up another 25% and my back to the &quot;door&quot;.<p>I hate that I spend all day patching the same kinds of holes again and again without the authority to fix the root problems. I hate that I have no real ability to influence the direction of my organization. Without agency it become very difficult to keep caring about the product. I hate that nobody else cares either. I work purely to support my family. That is the only reason. I used to love writing software, and I still do, but I hate my job. I hate that I feel like everything that makes me who I am is being slowly ground away into nothing.<p>I get home with time for the kids but I have nothing left. My mental tank is completely empty. I almost can&#x27;t get up in the mornings, I don&#x27;t want to get up. If it wasn&#x27;t for my wife and kids I wouldn&#x27;t get up. Somehow this wonderful, exciting process of solving problems and finding solutions to people&#x27;s needs has turned into torture. I&#x27;m on a sinking ship and am too burdened with responsibility to jump off. So I&#x27;m frantically trying in my spare time to build a raft so I can find my own island. I feel like I&#x27;m racing against time. I have to finish the raft before I have a mental break and land my family on welfare and me on a psychologist&#x27;s couch.<p>There are great things about my job, those benefits that you mention: 40 hours a week (well, 50 including the commute), an above-average salary (my wife can spend her quality time teaching and raising our kids), job security (we&#x27;ve been planning to end-of-life the product for longer than I&#x27;ve been here), a reasonable boss (who is just as powerless to change things as I am).<p>I guess I&#x27;m not really disagreeing with you, just sharing an admittedly depressed view from the other side. We do have a choice, and right now my choice is to pull late nights after the kids go to bed. I&#x27;m scrambling to create my own software that I can sell so I don&#x27;t have to go to this 9-5 which you advocate for OP.",1400685980

But I just have to comment on this:<p>> unless that third party is insured by a government in the event of disaster.<p>&quot;Insurance by government&quot; does not help those who save money. Dollar lost 98% of value over the century. It did not help those in Cyprus last year who got their deposits locked up indefinitely within the island. And it will not help EU depositors if ECB starts using Cyprus case as they suggested in last year&#x27;s paper. According to your own words, &quot;your money belongs to someone else&quot; and those guys will be able to take it from you should they need it before you run to an ATM.<p>Also: all those bail-outs and QE? Those are effective taxes that instead of changing number of units on your account, make your share of money supply (and therefore purchasing power) smaller while someone else&#x27;s share gets bigger. Primarily, of some big bankers or investor groups. (Example: did you notice how businesses struggle to stay up, or how prices rise, especially in the places close to money distribution centers: e.g. NYC, SF, London, Paris?)<p>So I would say, considering all of the above, &quot;FDIC insurance&quot; (or alike) is more like a red herring. Your bank will never fail and take all your money outright because it allows the entire system of banks to steal from you steadily in a more obscure manner.

Gox.  The lawyer demonstrates that they&#x27;ve been engaged by a consortium of foreign investors.  The trustee looks diligently for other options to liquidate 200k BTC, finds that the Bitcoin ecosystem is a hive of scum and villainy, and says that he&#x27;s willing to consider the consortium&#x27;s offer.  They offer $PICK_A_NUMBER, which represents a substantial discount to what many Bitcoiners believe the spot price of 200k BTC to be, but which is -- crucially -- actually available, in actual honest-to-the-Constitution yen, from someone who is almost certainly not a criminal enterprise.  The bankruptcy trustee, satisfied that he has diligently explored the options, counteroffers with regards to the price.  Terms are reached, a contract is hammered out in an afternoon, and payment is made via a wire transfer.  Physical delivery of the Bitcoins is accomplished by the technical experts nominated by the buyers, in the company of the bankruptcy trustee and the representative director of the company.  The bankruptcy trustee writes them a receipt and enters the transaction into the books of the company.  The universe quivers in anticipation but then realizes &#x27;Wait, much more interesting commerce happens in Tokyo every day.&#x27;  The bankruptcy trustee then begins drafting a memo to stakeholders of the corporation on the likely amount of liquid assets which the corporation controls to satisfy claims made against it.&quot;",1400685614

205798,comment,205600,205731,0,0,m0nty,,,"I disagree. It's not about co-operating to build a monolithic system, it's about each niche-player dominating that niche. Etsy is a good example: I've sold several items (stained glass) there, but trying to do the same on eBay was a waste of time -- and the listing fee. I still use eBay (to buy) but more diversity and competition in the marketplace would be most welcome.",1212316717

In addition, no customer servers were damaged or lost.<p>We have just been allowed into the building to physically inspect the damage.  Early indications are that the short was in a high-volume wire conduit.  We were not allowed to activate our backup generator plan based on instructions from the fire department.<p>This is a significant outage, impacting approximately 9,000 servers and 7,500 customers.  All members of our support team are in, and all vendors who supply us with data center equipment are on site.  Our initial assessment, although early, points to being able to have some service restored by mid-afternoon on Sunday.  Rest assured we are working around the clock.<p>We are in the process of communicating with all affected customers.  we are planning to post updates every hour via our forum and in our customer portal.  Our interactive voice response system is updating customers as well.<p>There is no impact in any of our other five data centers.<p>I am sorry that this accident has occurred and apologize for the impact.<p>Sincerely,<p>Douglas J. Erwin\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer""<p>I am not happy.",1212316107

There are a lot more men using online dating than women. [1] Online dating right now works incredibly well for homosexual ""dating"", particularly casual sex for men who like men, but Craigslist has the network effect already.<p>Honestly I'm really curious why no one has cracked it on facebook yet.

205786,comment,205420,205580,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"DAA isn't intended to solve the same problem as SSL. SSL also isn't always worth the cost of the certificate, depending on the information being guarded; nor is it absolutely secure [<a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2004/111.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2004/111.pdf</a>, May 2004].<p>I don't understand the all-or-none attitude that appears to be prevalent in the security industry. For all the discussion spent on search spaces, and maximizing attack effort, there doesn't seem to be much acceptance for ""good enough"" security. There appears to be this attitude that -- to use wireless security as one example -- ""WEP is broken, so you might as well just run a totally open network.""<p>I see that when you say that anybody that can sniff traffic for stupid JavaScript hashes can also necessarily inject traffic to alter the negotiation between the host and the client. While in theory that's correct, in practice it ignores the difference in the number of people that know enough to execute either attack.<p>It makes sense to say, ""If you're going to do password encryption, you might as well do it right"", but I don't think it follows that even a stupid JavaScript MD5 hashing scheme is as insecure as plain-text password transmission.",1212314400

  This is just flat out wrong.
</code></pre>
Saying this is wrong implies that the gap between ideal processor-specific assembly and generated code is closing, and that compilers today can achieve a higher percentage of potential performance than they could in the past.   Do you have evidence that suggests this is true?  Are you possibly conflating &quot;optimizing the code as written including all unintentially specified corner cases&quot; with &quot;optimizing the production of the desired answer&quot;?<p>In my personal experience (which is mostly compression and scientific computing), I find that I can get significantly higher x64 performance from Haswell than from earlier Intel generations --- frequently more than twice as fast as I can do for Sandy Bridge, due to a combination of better memory interactions, fewer scheduling gotcha&#x27;s, and wider integer vectors.   Very rarely do I find that compiler generated code (Clang, GCC, icc) achieves this level of speedup, and even more rarely do I find that the same code gets optimal performance on both of these generations.  Even more rarely does the generated assembly surprise me by exceeding my expectations of maximal performance.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where Daniel is going with his presentation, but what I often find myself wanting is a non-brain-dead non-optimizing compiler.  It makes me sad to know how to make code run fast, but be unable to keep the compiler from slowing it down.  Obviously, this is a rare case, since only a tiny percentage of code will ever be allowed to be this highly optimized.    But I sure wish that there was a way to return to &quot;glorified assembly&quot;, and that I had a way to tell the compiler to keep its grubby little fingers off certain small sections of my consciously crafted code.",1426359218

9203683,comment,9200801,9201049,0,0,ikken,,,"What you are writing is exactly why I threw game theory into the mix. Game theory show strategies that given a certain set of rules are beneficial for the player or all players (for interesting example see Nash equilibrium). The example you have given in first paragraph, that forbidding slavery creates a better environment for the whole of it&#x27;s people is exactly just that - showing one strategy to be more beneficial than the other. It&#x27;s not showing that slavery is &quot;objectively&quot; wrong. I remember seeing a nature documentary where two species were explained to live in something that could be seen a master/slave symbiosis which benefited them both. (As a sidenote, I&#x27;m all against slavery and I do not accept causing harm to others no matter how beneficial it would be to myself).<p>You say that &quot;people tend to live better lives&quot; and &quot;I would like to live in&quot; etc. This is very subjective. As for quantifying wellbeing of members, we may ask if it&#x27;s better for 100% of society to feel well, or is it better for 80% of society to feel fantastic and 20% miserable and in fear. It&#x27;s again a matter of opinion and we can use mathematical concepts like game theory to better explain using formal methods why some moral values would be beneficial for us and other&#x27;s not. That&#x27;s why I threw it into the mix.<p>You also say that some opinions are better than others. This general statement is very dangerous and was used throughout the ages by proponents of slavery, racism etc. They definitely claim that their opinions are better than yours while you do otherwise. The thing is, some opinions are better to achieve certain goal given some set of circumstances, rules and participants. Acknowledging that opinions and moral values are not objectively right or wrong doesn&#x27;t make us crazy to pursue those that we see as moving the society we live in in the direction we want.",1426358595

The Roman empire had the technology of written language, and a lot of their records, written in Latin, survive today. Unfortunately those records are shrouded in many dense layers of propaganda: they’ve been selectively preserved and presented by academics over the millennia, to support whatever political, religious, or philosophical cause; and of course, many of them were spun to the political needs of the Romans who wrote them in the first place. As a consequence, most ancient history should should be taken with several grains of salt.

As I occasionally point out on why C programs are so buggy, the three big problems in C are &quot;how big is it&quot;, &quot;who owns it&quot;, and &quot;who locks it&quot;. The language doesn&#x27;t help with any of those.  Those problems also inhibit optimization.<p>One optimization that&#x27;s been lost to history is optimizing subscript checking.  This was done in some Pascal compilers, and about 95% of subscript checks can be optimized out.  Where there&#x27;s a loop involved, it&#x27;s often possible to make one check at loop entry, rather than a check at every reference.  Sometimes that one check can be proven true from FOR statement bounds, and can be eliminated.  This is usually the case for numeric matrix work, where it really matters.<p>I had a talk with one of the designers of Rust about this last Wednesday.  They&#x27;re not optimizing subscript checks yet.  They hope to do so. They&#x27;re currently limited by being a front-end to LLVM, which doesn&#x27;t really comprehend subscript checks. The Go compiler does some subscript check optimizations, but only on FOR statements of restricted form.<p>C, Go, and Rust all lack multidimensional arrays.  This prevents a whole range of array-related optimizations which FORTRAN compilers have had all the way back to Backus&#x27;s first FORTRAN compiler in 1956. This is part of why the supercomputer crowd still uses FORTRAN.<p>I was trying to push the Go crowd towards multidimensional arrays.  People in love with the slicing syntax wanted to extend it to multidimensional arrays. There were long arguments over how far to take that. Should you be able to slice out an arbitrary sub-hypercube of an N-dimensional array?  If you allow that, you have to have a slice representation which is general but inefficient.  After much discussion, nothing happened.<p>Meanwhile, the number-crunching crowd is trying to compile Matlab, which has multi-dimensional arrays but not much else.",1426356908

Putting chemicals with noticeable medical effects into your body is something that is rarely &#x27;safe&#x27; in an absolute sense.<p>Many drugs can be used safely, but there are very few drugs that cannot be used dangerously.  There are even medicines that <i>cannot</i> be used safely that are nonetheless used in situations where they offer better odds than the alternative.<p>All drugs are either excreted renally (by the kidney) or metabolized (and possibly excreted) by the liver.  Both of these can cause damage to the organ involved if the cumulative load of chemicals that need processing exceeds safe limits;  the former is especially serious.  In some cases with the latter, there can be cascading consequences due to the toxic nature of the metabolic products (as is dramatically illustrated by the metabolization of methanol).<p>This is why recreational drug use poses a quandary for regulation.  If one is placed in the position of being responsible for determining that a substance is &quot;safe enough&quot; for unregulated use, it is very hard to determine a standard for making that decision.  Ethanol, for instance, is clearly not &quot;safe enough&quot; for unregulated use.  It is toxic, addictive, socially destructive, and causes thousands of deaths a year.  Articulating a standard whereby one should, on one&#x27;s authority, permit that people should be able to get themselves killed using some chemical one has never heard of:  this is a difficult task.  A regulatory structure that leans too heavily on authority --- rather than precedent, tests of merit, and community consensus decisions, for instance --- is destined to produce extremely conservative results.<p>I think that what these people are doing is great, and it is possibly a huge boon to large areas of psychiatric, neurochemical, and psychological research.  It is clear at this point that some traditionally &#x27;recreational&#x27; psychotropic drugs can have therapeutic effects in some situations.  This will allow researchers to develop concrete evidence about specific protocols.<p>However, I am not sure that this is a first case for stepwise liberalization of drug policies:  these are drugs that are medically interesting because of their specific effects, rather than due to the misrecognition of their actual harm.  In my opinion, North American society is still at a point where we are just beginning to discuss marijuana seriously in term of harm, and the meaning of noticeable psychedelic & sensual effects are being mooted.  There is already a cultural framework available for understanding and accepting recreational drug use, but it needs a lot of poking, prodding, and testing before it will be adapted by society at large.  In order for drug policy liberalization to occur, there would need to be significant structural changes in policy, regulatory bodies, societal doctrines of use, and the social systems that deal with the social consequences of drug use, self-medication for dysphoric personal experiences, and non-self-supporting individuals.<p>For the record, have used and did enjoy psilocybin:  based purely on the subjective experience, would use again, but it would be medically unadvisable for me at this time.",1426356712

Saudi Arabia is driving the price down by selling a lot of oil for very low prices.<p>If you&#x27;re the United States or Russia, oil production is a relatively small part of the GDP. We use a lot of oil, but don&#x27;t really care much where it comes from. Iran on the other hand, that&#x27;s like 1/4th of their GDP. (I don&#x27;t know if Iran or ISIS or even Iraq is the target. I don&#x27;t think Saudi Arabia would have a problem with hurting any of them) Price changes there hit very very hard. Directly it lowers oil employment, it lowers tax revenue, and it affects all sorts of businesses in the area. Unemployed people don&#x27;t go out to restaurants for lunch, which hurts employment and tax revenue even more.<p>So then, the problems become political. Countries and organizations need to start rethinking policies about how nice they&#x27;re going to be to their neighbors.<p>I don&#x27;t know what Saudi Arabia&#x27;s goal is, but with a trillion dollars in the bank, they can sell at a loss for a long long time.

Specifically:<p><i>According to the court’s own figures, as of December
2014, over 16,000 people had outstanding arrest warrants that had been issued by the court. In
fiscal year 2013 alone, the court issued warrants to approximately 9,007 people. Many of those
individuals had warrants issued on multiple charges, as the 9,007 warrants applied to 32,975
different offenses.</i><p>No where in the body of this statement does it specify how many of the people to whom warrant&#x27;s were issued are <i>residents</i>.

Furthermore no where in the NPR article does it state how many of those warrants issued were for Ferguson residents.<p>Combined with conclusions such as:<p><i>The DOJ report shows not just a racist criminal justice system, but one in which the very act of being alive has been made a crime, and in which nearly every resident is wanted by the law at every moment of every day.</i><p>I&#x27;m inclined to call it shoddy journalism.",1426356313

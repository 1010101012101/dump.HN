Now you must patent it in order to be safe. A troll can come along at any time and patent your idea and screw you out of your hardwork.<p>This is only true if you apply for the patent at a later date, without publicly releasing the invention or giving out any details.  In a first-to-invent case, you would have a prior art argument if you applied for the patent after the other party.  However, if you don't ever bother patenting or releasing the invention, you do not have any protections in either a first-to-file or first-to-invent system.  Those rules only apply when two patents for the same invention are applied for around the same time.<p>If you release the invention as a product, and someone files for the patent after you released it, that is a clear prior art case, and they should lose the patent.",1315598250

That alone is a really big positive sign in my opinion that this is really going somewhere.<p>In no other channels have I seen people so dedicated to watching something that they want to watch the commercials. I think it has to do with the fact that viewers know it directly supports that caster alone (and a little to JTV of course).

2979579,comment,2978460,2979452,7,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Let me confess: I'm failing to rephrase the argument because I'm not sure it works. ;)<p>I see three threads in this essay, all of which are basically correct:<p>A) Some software is like a combover, in that it starts out great, but gets gradually uglier, but the ugliness grows so slowly that it never stands out as an urgent problem so you never really confront it.<p>B) If you postpone confronting a problem in software it just gets <i>harder and harder</i> to fix when you eventually <i>do</i> confront it.<p>C) Java has now spent, like, fifteen years without lambdas, so adding them now is extraordinarily painful.<p>... but I can't justify the implied <i>connection</i> between any of these threads.<p>A and B are disconnected threads because combovers don't really become more difficult to fix over time. Whether you notice your combover on the day you lose your first three hairs, or ten years too late, the solutions are the same and are pretty simple: Get a better haircut that doesn't try to hide your baldness, shave yourself bald and <i>embrace</i> the baldness, or buy a hairpiece. This is quite unlike the way software works -- most of real life is quite unlike the way software works; that's why programmers always feel misunderstood -- so the metaphor just breaks here. Better be sure to abandon your metaphor before this point. ;)<p>And A and C are disconnected threads because, while some projects have the combover nature, I don't really think <i>Java</i> is one of them. Combovers happen slowly, below the radar, but the ""problem"" of missing lambdas didn't slowly creep up on Java's designers: Java is missing lambdas because its original designers <i>deliberately left them out</i>. (What, you're going to claim with a straight face that a team with <i>Guy Steele</i> on it just <i>accidentally</i> forgot about closures?)<p>The <i>world</i> has changed around Java, such that it now seems like a good idea (to some people) to add closures after all, and the language is certainly well into middle age and therefore hard to change, but this isn't really a ""combover"" situation.",1315598038

Instead of embracing your new look of baldness you'll comb any hair over, whip it around in a circle, whatever it takes. They had basically a perfect opportunity to just say ""Java 6 is what it is"" and make Java 7/8 the new thing with reified generics, lambdas, etc. Lambdas got added through the regular Java process of never breaking anything so they'll be there and I'll use them, it's just a missed opportunity.

This was much faster than previous methods, increasing production by eight to one (requiring 12.5 man-hours before, 1 hour 33 minutes after), while using less manpower.[2] It was so successful, paint became a bottleneck. Only japan black would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1914, until fast-drying Duco lacquer was developed in 1926.[2] In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.[2]<p>""The assembly line technique was an integral part of the diffusion of the automobile into American society. Decreased costs of production allowed the cost of the Model T to drop within the budget of the American middle class. In 1908, the price of a Model T was around $825, and by 1912 it had dropped to around $575. This price reduction is comparable to a drop from $15,000 to $10,000 in dollar terms from the year 2000.""<p>To me those numbers are quite significant. I am no student of automobile history, but it seems to me that the primary driver of Ford's success was the massive production efficiencies and reduced costs associated with the modern moving assembly line. I have to imagine there were ""better"" cars than the Model T, or other cars that had more prototypes and iterations.<p>Anyhow, I don't really mean to dispute the author's thesis here, since there's not really enough evidence to judge it. But I'm having a really hard time being convinced that some factor <i>other than</i> Ford reducing the production time per car by a factor of almost 10 and the price by almost half was primarily responsible for the company's success with the Model T.",1315596929

They're a dumping ground for methods that are crying out to be properly structured. Surely not even the most fervent Rails advocate would claim that it is complete and unimprovable.<p>Every single helper module is mixed in to every single view instance, no matter how irrelevant it may be. There's therefore no reason to carefully choose where to put your helper functions, because they're all available, all the time. This means that a new coder coming along has no idea where to look for helper functions that might be relevant to a particular view he's creating - they could be in literally any helper, or even be helper-ified controller methods. This in turn means you end up with duplicated functionality, orphaned functions, and obsolete cruft stinking up the joint.<p>As a result, any even slightly professional team <i>must</i> develop their own conventions regarding the placement of helper functions. These conventions need to be communicated somehow, and how better to do that than through the code itself? Once you've got a pile of helper functions that are bound by a common cause, why not give that cause a name?",1315595862

Java is just a handy example. The current title of the actual essay (""Software's Receding Hairline"") is a much better one than the one here on HN. It looks (from the URL) like the essay has been retitled? That was a good choice, and that retitling should be reflected in the HN headline as well.<p>I don't believe that the essay ever suggests that Java programmers should not program in Java. Indeed, it explicitly suggests that you should avoid making harsh judgements on people with combovers!",1315594809

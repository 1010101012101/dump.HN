Take a look at the death toll of the conflict: the fact that more pressure is on Hamas than Israel to &quot;commit to non-violence etc.&quot; from various actors like the Quartet is a sign of how biased those actors truly are.<p>I&#x27;ve been downvoted, presumably because people seem to believe &quot;we need to bomb the other side / wipe them out in order to begin to discuss peace&quot; mentality but that&#x27;s been the predominant strategy for decades and it hasn&#x27;t gotten far. Hamas rose to popularity in the OPT because they were seen as an institution that was providing social services (hospitals, schools, etc.) and wasn&#x27;t as corrupt at the local level as the PA. If you take a 30-year view, Hamas went from enjoying support from the Israeli military as a counterweight to the PLO to being the reason Israel claims they can&#x27;t have any productive dialogue with the PA.  It&#x27;s morally bankrupt.<p>Predicating negotiations on capitulation of the other side (in terms of things like the Hamas charter, recognition, non-violence, what have you) isn&#x27;t diplomacy, it&#x27;s the complete absence thereof.",1405788279

I see the largely ignored wider aspect to be that of skills learning, particularly in light of <i>unlearning</i> and lost plasticity.<p>The key paragraphs are these:<p>&quot;[A] 2-year-old’s brain has a substantial neurological advantage, with 50 percent more synapses — the connections between neurons — than an adult brain, way more than it needs. This excess, which is an insurance policy against early trauma, is also crucial to childhood language acquisition, as is the plasticity, or adaptability, of the young brain.<p>[NB:  I challenge the assumption that the excess neural capacity is simply for trauma recovery -- it seems specifically applicable to the very mental plasticity that youthful skill acquisition entails, and which <i>needs</i> to be discarded as concrete skills are laid down.]<p>&quot;Another advantage a toddler holds is his very lack of experience. After speaking our native language for decades, we adults can’t help but hear the second language through the filter of the first. And this filter doesn’t take decades to develop. Researchers have found that newborn Japanese babies can distinguish between the English “L” and “R” sounds, but if not exposed to Western languages, they begin to lose that ability — not by the age of 6 or even 3 — but by eight months.<p>&quot;Adult language learners are, to borrow a phrase used by some psycholinguists, too smart for our own good. We process too much data at once, try to get everything right from the get-go and are self-conscious about our efforts. But toddlers instinctively grasp what’s important and are quite content to say, “Tommy hitted me,” as long as Tommy gets what’s coming to him.&quot;<p>That is, if you&#x27;re trying to learn something, <i>anything</i>, as an adult, you&#x27;re up against two principle blocks:<p>• Your brain has physiologically adapted. It&#x27;s no longer sufficiently plastic to accept novel concepts.<p>• You&#x27;ve got a litany of previously acquired skills (or biases) which get in the way of the new knowledge.  It&#x27;s a form of Mark Twain&#x27;s famous &quot;It&#x27;s not the things you don&#x27;t know, but what you know for sure that just ain&#x27;t so&quot;.<p>Or, in this case, just ain&#x27;t what the new skill you&#x27;re trying to pick up is.<p>Which may also help explain youthful hiring bias in software and tech.",1405787808

[1] How many users flagging the story does it take to produce this outcome? Does GCHQ just need three accounts with a little karma to seriously diminish visibility here for days? Safeguards should be developed to prevent this sort of malicious activity. Maybe some sort of collusion penalty, where if the same users are flagging the same stories, the effect is diminished?

That was the area ruled by the Mughals, which was called India because, well it was. Their rule can be described as having a death toll of between 30 and 50 world war IIs.<p>The area of the Mughal empire is most definitely both religiously and ethnically cleansed. So it the other side. Before islam northern africa was black. In all likelihood, Hannibal was black.<p>There is no assimilation. Now in this case is was because of constant massacres, perpetraded predominantly by the muslim side (but where one side starts massacring, revenge will come).<p>But it doesn&#x27;t really matter. The European conquest of the Americas has only a few massacres, certainly not comparable to what happened in Northern Africa or India. For the most part Native American culture dissappeared because, well, frankly, because Native Americans preferred European culture above their tribes (and in a lot of cases, they didn&#x27;t have much of a choice, having lost a duel for leadership, or a woman, according to several monks who wrote on the subject). You see the same in places where &quot;natural&quot; human communities still exist, like sub-saharan Africa.<p>Just talk to the people there.

And no, they&#x27;re not prudes, the women can fuck whoever they want, kids are the village&#x27;s kids, not really having any real mother or father, just a group of people who care for them (mostly the older children)). They are voluntarily abandoning the culture they have en-masse to attempt (and mostly fail) to join the third world. Having been there, I can certainly see why.

The iMessage protocol is touted to use end-to-end encryption, however Quarkslab revealed in their research that the asymmetric keys generated to perform this encryption are exchanged through key directory servers centrally managed by Apple, which allow for substitute keys to be injected to allow eavesdropping to be performed. Similarly, the group revealed that certificate pinning, a very common and easy-to-implement certificate chain security mechanism, was not implemented in iMessage, potentially allowing malicious parties to perform MiTM attacks against iMessage in the same  fashion.<p>So much for iMessage security.

8057859,comment,8057346,8057346,7,0,snide,,,"I&#x27;ve worked on 5-6 high traffic content sites in my 15 year career. The problem with Internet advertising is likely the part that people first loved about it: immediate analytics.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem. When every action you get paid for is a metric, it forces those metrics to eventually be corrupted. Need CPM eyeballs? We solved that one decades ago... link rings. Today&#x27;s link ring is outbrain, nrelate and the rest. Here, we&#x27;ll put web sugar on our pages with bikinis and top 10 lists. Eyeballs you have. Doesn&#x27;t matter that the site sells itself as a tech magazine, it&#x27;s real traffic is comic con photos of Jean Grey. No one will know.<p>Maybe you get paid for clicks. OK. We have solutions for that too. Let&#x27;s put adwords in the page. Let&#x27;s style them to look like navigation. Let&#x27;s create popovers with super tiny close buttons that purposefully have their display and href off by a few pixels. Let&#x27;s delay it to load so that we can likely grab a rogue accidental click as well. Smaller screen, less precision as you do in mobile? Perfect, even better. We&#x27;ll autoplay movies one after the other, but only if we have an ad. There&#x27;s a system to all of this.<p>Then of course you run into the engineers and executives that simply don&#x27;t care. The Internet to them isn&#x27;t the democratization of knowledge, it&#x27;s an opportunity. &quot;People want to click on Bikinis, why do you care&quot;. The problem of course is ads become a pattern. Once one large site falls into selling a certain system, the rest fall like dominos. Because the ad providers aren&#x27;t going to create unique ads per site.<p>Meanwhile I was building very genuine, audience driven sites that were doing a hundreds of thousands of people a day. Mostly, believe it or not, DIRECT traffic. It doesn&#x27;t matter. You can&#x27;t compete with 10s of millions from link arbitrage, 99% referral traffic. You&#x27;re not a big site. You don&#x27;t matter. Sure we&#x27;d get hundreds of real comments and discussion per story, but there&#x27;s only three-hundred thousand people on the site, who cares.<p>The problem of course is this is just as big a problem for the content producers themselves. They go to work day to day and get beaten over the head to make cheap, quick content that attracts the most viewers. The shotgun approach, something will hit. For the first couple years they fight it out, but eventually they give up too. It&#x27;s easy.<p>There are companies solely dedicated to this. They create cheap content with little or no value, a getty image subscription, and siphon links from larger, less valuable networks like yahoo and aol. They pay 1 cent for the link and charge 2 for the ad. These quick, pop-up sites feature some sort of vertical branding (cars, babies...etc) and sell their growth to unknowlegable ad-buyers. Look, we&#x27;re a brand new car site that&#x27;s getting 2 million uniques a day!<p>It&#x27;s depresses me sometimes. It was hard to work around that kind of scam and not dip to those levels. The pressure is always immense. If you just use such and such dark pattern, you can solve all your problems.<p>I really hope things like Patreon work out. I&#x27;d love to see people paying for smart content. It&#x27;s needs to be easier than it is.<p>It&#x27;s of course not all bad. On the positive, small scale publishing by the individual is as healthy as ever. A good quarter of the links you&#x27;ll read on this page today are on somebody&#x27;s blog, containing no ads and featuring real, genuine ideas and knowledge.",1405786626

Moreover, the evidence also shows decriminalization policies gaining ground as public opinion shifts.<p>The bottom line is that the thesis underlying most of the comments in this thread is wrong. For profit prisons, police unions, etc, are not the biggest roadblocks to legalization. They&#x27;re opportunists, but the backbone of the drug war is massive support from soccer moms and dads, the reliable voters that created the drug war in the first place. And if the medical community starts chipping away at them, change will follow, regardless of what the prison lobbey wants.",1405786581

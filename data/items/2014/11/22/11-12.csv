8645366,comment,8643428,8644116,0,0,sgt101,,,"Downstream bandwidth is mostly delivered using caches. Upstream bandwidth is not delivered using caches. So to provide the backhaul for upstream bandwidth we will do deep reach into the datacentre <-> home and interconnect in the data centre. Therefore fttp will not provide p2p connectivity unless there is a need for local connectivity because deepreach and datacentre networking is rendered non viable by sheer traffic volume. But the traffic will need to be geographically localised and/or the services will have to provide the economic support for backhaul uplift.<p>I think we can probably do petabits on single mode fibre bundles now with the right boxes  but the trick is the right boxes, which are spensive and take lots of electricity to run. So even if you can pony up for an FTTP roll out then the use cases are going to be constrained by the network architecture that is used to support it.<p>Now, for most people this is not a problem as the up channel is basically irrelevant in terms of bandwidth in the current consumer internet, but if you are the sort of person who imagines a decentralised and democratic consumer internet which is not mediated by massive supernational companies, or if you are the sort of person who is interested in where the  value is captured in the industry value chain I think this does matter.<p>Sharing other peoples content will not fund a democratic internet even if governments fund and regulate fttp. We need a new class of applications that generate revenue sufficient to pay for the infrastructure that will facilitate them. If we get that then the infrastructure will also facilitate a shift away from the data centre (not it&#x27;s elimination though as it will be the way that the current usecases are delivered)<p>If you have any ideas please write them up - before the industry dies!",1416656791

Just run a 1-3ms incremental GC every frame when you have time to spare, and as long as your game&#x27;s theoretical performance is good enough, you won&#x27;t ever hitch.

8645338,comment,8643500,8643500,0,0,jrapdx3,,,"Quite late here, and I wish I had more time to comment.  I guess the main point to make is the assertions about effects on serotonin/dopamine systems of higher altitude locations, and effects of these messenger chemicals on mood/cognition are vast oversimplifications of very complex multiple system interactions.<p>To begin with, in important respects characterizing 5HT/DA as &quot;neurotransmitters&quot; is not quite accurate.  Certainly 5HT and DA play diverse roles in the brain and elsewhere, but often act as <i>modulators</i> of neuronal firing patterns rather than primary signal transmission itself.  Hence not necessarily &quot;excitatory&quot; or &quot;inhibitory&quot; in a direct sense.  Something like a gate in an FET modulating current flow between source and drain.<p>We usually think of glutamate as the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, and GABA being inhibitory, but it&#x27;s not a clean separation, since there can be a range of effects on subsets of receptors.<p>Furthermore, 5HT, DA, and a host of other monamines and peptides have complex interactions to up- or downregulate transmission in neuronal circuits.<p>It may be true that there are correlations among variables of altitude, suicide, or even attentional disorders.  However, not only does correlation not imply causality, it&#x27;s especially ambiguous when there is a potentially unlimited range of contributors, perhaps far too many to factor in to the results.<p>For instance, I live in Oregon where around 90% of the population lives in the Willamette Valley, essentially at sea-level elevation.  Yet according to the graphics in the article, Oregon has a high (but not the highest) rate of depression and suicidal behavior, known issues to be sure.<p>We do suffer other conditions like substantially northern latitude, widespread Vitamin D insufficiency, economic stresses, and other factors to take into account.<p>Perhaps the work described in the article could generate some interesting hypotheses, but painting with such a broad brush seems overstating the case and likely to be misleading.",1416655254

You must admit however that not all of them can be attributed to FOSS, and all of them are quite low-level compared to what average user needs to be able to use it effectively.<p>I just wonder if we need 10 major Linux distros none of which is easy to set up and use to an average user. (sorry, even Ubuntu is still not there)<p>I am a big believer in open web and it makes me cringe every time I see a new cool technology that uses closed protocols (or rather APIs) as it happens with IoT right now. But it&#x27;s hard for me to attribute it to anything else than lack of leadership from FOSS community.",1416654158

313394,comment,313384,313384,0,0,denglish,,,"Interesting article, and a phenomenon I hadn't thought about before. One thing the article didn't really focus on that struck me as a more intuitive way of understanding the phenomenon is that 1 is the first digit hit when the order of magnitude is increased (and 2 the next). So assuming for example a particular sample rarely goes above a given number, say 250 for argument sake, that means a large sample of the results are likely to be between 100 and 199, majorly skewing the results. Even if x was 700 a first digit of 1 would be far more common than 8 or 9. At the next order of magnitude the same logic would apply.",1222257489

313388,comment,312378,312470,0,0,iuguy,,,"My wife bought an Asus EEE PC 701 (1st gen). She didn't like the fact that the apps were different (she's not technical but uses Linux) so I installed EEEBuntu as her main system runs Ubuntu but it was a little too slow for day to day use and the screen resolution was a little too small.<p>She now uses it with XP and has a much better experience (for her) - We have a 20Gb USB hard disk that she can stick to the lid with velcro patches. Her only problem is with having to mount the drive via truecrypt from suspend but she wanted encryption on the drive.",1222256724

313386,comment,313025,313025,0,0,dgreensp,,,"I don't think emacs has a steep learning curve for being a really efficient editor, the way (say) vi does.  If you can get through the day in emacs without touching the mouse, you're basically there, and the rest is just discovering all the features and ways to customize it.<p>Force yourself to move the insertion point with the arrow keys, for starters.  Then learn a few shortcuts so you don't go insane.  C-a for beginning of line, C-e for end.  M-f and M-b for forward/backwards by a whole word.  C-v and M-v will scroll you up and down through the document and move the insertion point so that it stays on the screen.<p>Emacs doesn't need a lot of UI.  It isn't an IDE, for one thing (though it can be used as one).  Customization is done by putting incantations in your .emacs file.  Managing buffers and panes only requires a handful of commands;  learn the keys for them, or re-assign them if they're awkward.",1222256546

One that you could implement in large parts of the world.<p>Pay everybody using debit cards drawn on a foreign bank using some stable foreign currency.<p>But just try it there and see what happens.

Something somewhere has have a web server implemented in order for you to test things in your browser.  And if you don't like Apache, there's always Lighttpd and other web server options.<p>Probably the best thing for PHP though is that once you set up your trivial testing server, you never have to touch it again.  You just keep refreshing the page, or pointing the browser at new pages, no matter how much code you write or file structures you change.  It just works.",1222255663

313380,comment,312581,313205,0,0,nuclear_eclipse,,,"Correct.  But that doesn't mean that it's any less important in the mobile ecosystem.  It's the only truly <i>free</i> phone in every sense of the word.  You're free to do anything with the phone, at any time, without the permission of phone manufacturers, or app store reviewers, or fucking NDAs.<p>The biggest problem with Openmoko is that nobody knows about them, and nobody realizes <i>why they matter</i>.  Everybody sees the horrors going on between Apple, the App Store, and developers' applications being rejected for competing with Apple, and then they complain about it, but that's just the way it is.<p>Yet that's not how it <i>should</i> be, and if everyone could find out about Openmoko, and actually realize and know <i>why</i> their freedoms truly matter, and that Openmoko makes the most freedoms-loving phone on the planet, then I wouldn't have anything more to talk about.<p>But we all know that even Openmoko's unexpectedly high sales amounts for the FreeRunner is still only a drop in the ocean compared to even only the iPhone, and even less compared to the entire smartphone industry.  And that's why it matters to me and others to get the word out, to let people know that there really is another option that doesn't squelch your freedoms, and that if freedom truly matters to you, then you do have a choice.<p>Freedom is <i>Your Choice</i>.  I choose Freedom.",1222255149

If they weren't the only possible provider of Apps then they could legitimately reject ones they didn't like. The authors would just have to sell it somewhere else. But because they are determining whether an app can exist on the platform they have to be a lot more carefull about what they reject.",1222254054

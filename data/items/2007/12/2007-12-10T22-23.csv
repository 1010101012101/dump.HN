87989,comment,87863,87900,0,0,DocSavage,,,"<a href=""http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/research/compensation_daines_ceopay.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/research/compensation_daine...</a><p>This study did a peer comparison:<p>[First, the researchers defined a way to measure CEO skill. Although many studies have examined the relationship between CEO pay and company performance, Daines and his colleagues wanted to isolate specific evidence of executive competence. After all, company performance can depend on a number of factors beyond the power of an individual CEO: the economy, regulatory constraints, or industry conditions, to name just a few.<p>They decided that a firm run by a skilled CEO should consistently do better than its industry peers. More specifically, a skilled CEO should continue a firm's prior good performance and reverse poor performance. Conversely, a bad CEO would be more likely to continue a poor showing and to reverse the firm's prior successes.<p>The results were instructive: The study, which reviewed CEO pay and economic performance between 1991-2002, found that in small firms, highly paid CEOs generally are more skilled than their industry counterparts. The correlation is even stronger if the firm has a large shareholder or if the CEO has been paid largely in stocks and options. Conversely, pay is more likely to be negatively related to skill in larger firms. ""In many large firms, the highest paid executives actually performed the worst,"" said Daines.]",1197326750

87976,comment,87790,87790,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This is kind of a pointless exercise.  Nobody on this site is using RoR (or whatever) to build a few mildly dynamic pages.  Even if you were to compare an identical application built in each language/framework, you'd still be testing just that application.  And no one should be surprised that RoR is ""slow"" in comparison to these other options.  By the time you slap a framework on any of the others, you'll find they're an order of magnitude slower--maybe not as slow as RoR, since the Ruby interpreter is pretty slow, but still much more comparable.  In fact, CakePHP is known to be pretty comparable to RoR performance-wise.  Likewise for Catalyst, and the Perl interpreter is significantly faster than the Ruby interpreter.",1197325135

Django has a clever admin interface that gives you easy access to every data model you can dream up, but this is only a really neat hack.<p>Django provides a very clean layer on top of the database, and a great approach to structuring a system (apps, included urls.py, template dirs, templatetags, middleware). As with anything, though, the more complex the task, the more you need to be aware of what it is doing under the hood. Understanding when Django does lazy queries, where things are processed, etc. is very important.",1197325126

RoR is stunningly slow and PHP is pretty damned fast (in general--though I've seen a lot of pathologically bad PHP code in the wild that sucked for performance, usually due to database abuse...of course, I've also seen RoR apps that are even slower due to database abuse).  Luckily, most applications built in RoR (or PHP, or Catalyst, or Django, etc.) never have to scale out very much, and by the time they do, the revenue is hopefully there to help fix the problem by brute force.",1197324792

87965,comment,87393,87698,0,0,raju,,,"""The topics to study really depend on the programming task""<p>I agree... My day job does not involve any heavy mathematical problem solving, but a good intro to discrete or concrete mathematics (IMHO) proves to be a good foundation for programming in general. <p>I studied in an Indian curriculum and have had a lot of math schooling, but it was always done ""wrong"", with more emphasis on getting the answer right with no need to understand _why_ that answer is right, hence my reason to ask for a good book that others found an enjoyable read and one that teaches the concepts right. I always found math to be interesting, though sadly haven't done much of it since graduation... <p>Thanks for the link to the Springer series. I have never heard of it, but I will look into them, though honestly, the Knuth book does intrigue me. Looks like a time to hit the local bookstore...",1197324587

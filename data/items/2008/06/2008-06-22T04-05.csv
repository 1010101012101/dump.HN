224058,comment,223959,223959,0,0,rplevy,,,"This reminds me of pg's ""Why Are Nerds Unpopular?"".  Obviously these ""negative""-- and innate [directly or emerging from other innate behavioral] dispositions, are present and purposefully developed and honed extensively by individuals who prioritize the game of attracting mates, and gaining access to higher quality/quantity of mates.  Or maybe these universal traits just emerge from the practical requirements of achieving their goals.  In either case, being that type of person requires an enormous time commitment.  Social hierarchy climbing is their one ambition in life, and sex is their reward.<p>It's a lot more compatible with being a politician or power-seeker in business, than it is with being a geek.  The geek seeks to create/understand. So their creations and discoveries are their reward.  The geek may want what the alpha male has, even want it strongly, but values the primary geek rewards more strongly, and will never prioritize the alpha male reward enough to be that other person.  And it's good that many of us are not that person, because I couldn't see much value in a world without ambition to do actually worthwhile things.",1214109763

fuck you evolution and your maximized expected reproductive utility.  I'd rather be happy.  Happiness is probably selected against since satisfied, content people don't run around trying desperately to mate as much as possible.",1214109125

If you think it's the patch to bignum (where the offset you're looking at only controls a load, not a store), write the testcase and prove it.</i><p>Why should he?  He doesn't care, he doesn't use Ruby anymore.  You can rest assured that someone else has already written the exploit, but is keeping it to himself.  So you can either fix the bug, or hope that the person with the exploit doesn't use it on you.<p>Also, you should write correct code regardless of whether or not you think it's exploitable.

224050,comment,223977,224024,0,0,smanek,,,"True, part of the speed comes from it's (configurable) heuristics.<p>But, it's faster even when doing the same thing.

I ran a few test cases myself and got similar results.<p>But the real reason I like it is the perl compatible regexes. The differences between perl regexes and gnu regexes are just big enough to be an annoyance.",1214108912

on a less sarcastic note, notice that the traits mentioned are all leadership traits.  Leaders generally have to be somewhat narcissistic, otherwise they wouldn't believe they are worthy to be leader.  They have to be risk takers to upset the status quo.  And they have to be Machiavellian to govern efficiently.",1214108549

Wrong, apparently.<p>I think posts like this go to show that the flow of technically skilled people going from the Eastern European countries out West (or even to North America) may be slowing down if not coming to an end altogether just because the salary differential is no longer compelling enough for them to want to move.",1214107692

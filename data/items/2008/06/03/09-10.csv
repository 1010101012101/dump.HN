Just because the brain is hardwired to react to it in a certain way does not mean it is not simply information. You could easily program a robot that is incapable of pushing a needle into it's hand (provided there is a sensor there).<p>Disclaimer: I stopped reading the article after the description of the ""experiment"".",1212486402

I've played basically every genre, though I'm tending towards jazz lately.<p>I've been chewing on a long response for you here, but I think I'll save it for my blog. Instead, the short one: Touring only works at the superstar end of the scale, while recorded music revenue scales with the popularity of the artist. If the price of recorded music falls to zero, the labels don't have so much incentive to sign groups that aren't already at the touring-huge scale, since they're guaranteed to lose money on them...<p>Also, if  just giving away your music made you popular, MTV Cribs would feature a lot more unsigned artists than it does now (namely, zero). Since labels are the only ones in the music industry with the money to do the marketing that's essentially a prerequisite to getting huge, it's in the best interest of the artists for the labels to have the freedom to sign groups that are promising, but not yet big. That freedom comes from CD sales.",1212486295

207774,comment,207486,207486,0,0,yariv,,,"OO may not be inherently hard, but it is often used in overly complex ways, which makes it seem hard.<p>The OO patterns movement probably had something to do with it. It's easy sometimes to get the impression that with OO, you have to learn a bunch of weird patterns to produce good code, but with FP you don't have this conceptual overhead -- you just write the solution that feels the most compact and natural, almost in a mathematical sense.<p>Where OO does usually make life harder is in concurrent programming. Because objects have mutable state and hidden fields, it's difficult and often dangerous to send (and receive) them between processes. In Erlang, for example, all data is immutable and because it's made of simple (lists/tuples of) primitives, it's very easy to send it as messages (to processes on the local and/or remote VM) and to pattern match against it on the receiving end. This makes concurrent and distributed programming probably as easy as it can be.<p>I also find code written in function languages easier to read and debug because of data immutability. In code written in functional style, you know exactly where every variable is bound, so it's easy to track down bugs that cause it to have the wrong value. There's no mystery as to where a variable's data may be modified, which gives you confidence in the correctness of your solution.<p>I don't mean to suggest that FP is perfect and OO is broken. Sometimes when I write FP code I wish I could grab one or two concepts from OO. OO code can also be quite elegant as well.",1212485561

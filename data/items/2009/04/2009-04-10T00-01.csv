If you want to outsource management, go ahead; the cloud management company can reach in orders of magnitude more easily than you can move your data around out of the cloud. Remote backups to another cloud, yours or somebody elses, aren't that hard either. (The remote cloud would still be, well, remote, but it would be better than nothing while you're waiting for your local replacement servers to arrive.)<p>The only reasons that clouds currently must be hosted remotely is that A: it's slightly easier and B: the cloud owners <i>want</i> you to be locked in. A would be easy to overcome with some software if people wanted it. Everything else about the entire cloud idea works just as well if the cloud lives in your own server room or your choice of colo; easy server replacement, task migration, easy upgrades, whatever, it's all just software, not magic.<p>But the cloud owners don't want you to realize that.<p>(Once again, I think RMS is way ahead of the curve, and I think the next five to ten years will prove he was right.)",1239325012

  Names refer to objects. Names are introduced by name binding operations.
  Each occurrence of a name in the program text refers to the binding of that
  name established in the innermost function block containing the use.

  A block is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit.
  The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition. 
  A script file [...] is a code block. A script command [...] is a code
  block. The file read by the built-in function execfile() is a code block.
  The string argument passed to the built-in function eval() and to the
  exec statement is a code block. The expression read and evaluated by the
  built-in function input() is a code block.</code></pre>",1239324677

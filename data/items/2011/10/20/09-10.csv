3134176,comment,3133711,3134062,6,0,jimworm,,,"Journalists edit quotes and mention them out of context. The ""1000-page"" comment surely wasn't completely serious.<p>Here's a 1-paragraph summary:<p>""Our current approach to building products closes them off from each other, and from the rest of the net. That limits their usefulness to only what our product managers could predict and our engineers could build. This is a serious issue that will cause the products - and the company - to die. The alternative is to start thinking of products as data and functionality sharing platforms, let them interact, let outside devs play, and let the ecosystem grow. Growing an ecosystem this way is worthwhile: Amazon did amazingly well out of it even though implementing it via Bezos-mandate sucked in so many ways. Let's do that, and do it better.""",1319104774

Not sure how it's possible for Samsung to make part of the silicon (for the core) and someone else to make the RAM. Perhaps the RAM isn't on the A5 after all ;-)<p>There's no risk in Apple switching manufacturers (e.g. Samsung Nexus uses a TI OMAP SoC CPU, instead of a Samsung Exynos for the Galaxy S II).  Switching to Intel is the massive risk, since they don't use ARM cores at all, so the O/S would require a rewrite.<p>Finally, the Ivy Bridge microarchitecture isn't aimed at lower power computing (Intel Atom chips are based on the Bonnell microarchitecture), so there's unlikely be 3D transistor technology...<p>Apple's real move would be to drop the A6 entirely and focus on the same CPU's used by Android, since the both Android and Apple are using ARM V7 instruction sets with Cortex A9 cores.",1319104700

Many of the evaluations of his life and career were also relevant, as well as ruminations on the future of Apple. Most of these things I don't mind even if I think most of the premises about Apple are wrong. But this post is just pure cult, it's a link to the Apple front page because the page no longer has a tribute to Jobs.

3134097,comment,3131439,3132473,2,0,loup-vaillant,,,"I second the remarks about poor teaching (though C type syntax does sucks hard).  The main problem probably comes from the fact that <i>ordinary variables</i> are themselves an indirection of sorts, and programming courses do not make that clear (we tend to confuse the variable and the value it holds).  Excerpt from my article on assignment[1]:<p>[The pervasive use of the assignment statement] influenced many programming languages and programming courses. This resulted in a confusion akin to the classic confusion of the map and the territory.<p>Compare these two programs:<p><pre><code>  (* Ocaml *)            # most imperative languages\n  let x = ref 1          int x = 1\n  and y = ref 42         int y = 42\n  in x := !y;            x := y\n     print_int !x        print(x)\n</code></pre>\nIn Ocaml, the assignment statement is discouraged. We can only use it on ""references"" (variables). By using the ""ref"" keyword, the Ocaml program makes explicit that x is a variable, which holds an integer. Likewise, the ""!"" operator explicitly access the value of a variable. The indirection is explicit.<p>Imperative languages don't discourage the use of the assignment statement. For the sake of brevity, they don't explicitly distinguish values and variables. Disambiguation is made from context: at the left hand side of assignment statements, ""x"" refer to the variable itself. Elsewhere, it refers to its value. The indirection is implicit.<p>Having this indirection implicit leads to many language abuses. Here, we might say ""x is equal to 1, then changed to be equal to y"". Taking this sentence literally would be making three mistakes:<p>(1) x is a variable. It can't be equal to 1, which is a value (an integer, here). A variable is not the value it contains.<p>(2) x and y are not equal, and will never be. They are distinct variables. They can hold the same value, though.<p>(3) x itself doesn't change. Ever. The value it holds is just replaced by another.<p>The gap between language abuse and actual misconception is small. Experts can easily tell a variable from a value, but non-specialists often don't. That's probably why C pointers are so hard. They introduce an extra level of indirection. An int* in C is roughly equivalent to an int ref ref in Ocaml (plus pointer arithmetic). If variables themselves aren't understood, no wonder pointers look like pure magic.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.loup-vaillant.fr/articles/assignment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loup-vaillant.fr/articles/assignment</a>",1319102591

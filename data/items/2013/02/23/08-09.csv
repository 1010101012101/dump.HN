See if you have any message from Google on ""unnatural links"". Check your link profile. Try and figure out which are the sites that are causing the penalty.

I never minded the ads, which are used to keep the site running, and were a minor inconvenient to provide access to a huge amount of open source projects, which was great.<p>Github and Bitbucket simply provided pages and sites which were easier to navigate. Specially Bitbucket, which has kept the Downloads section that Github removed. However, for me, the biggest ""feature"" that Github and Bitbucket provided was the ability to create projects easily because (a) the project name only had to be unique to your own projects instead of globally and (b) you could simply fill the project name and a brief project description to create it, instead of having to fill a form with lots of information about the project area and categories, licenses, development language or technologies, etc.<p>Note I haven't used SourceForge for new projects in a long time, so I don't know if my observations still stand true.",1361609840

The upstream authors can provide a different version of the software for different releases of Go.<p>If you want to lock down the versions of all the software you're deploying in your organization, that's easy to do too.  Just ""git clone"" all of the libraries you use to some internal server (and/or github repos), and change the URLs to point to that server.  You control when everything gets updated.<p>Golang builds static binaries anyway.  So if you test a binary and it works, you just copy it to all the servers you care about and you're done.  If you're in a small and informal shop, maybe you don't need to mirror every repository.  Due to the nature of git, if the upstream repo ever gets deleted, you can fall back on a local copy of it anyway.<p>This is all very much in contrast to languages like Java where keeping around the proper version of every jar and carefully deploying that version (and only that version!)  on each server is big deal (and despite OSGI, still very much an unsolved problem.)",1361609636

The good news is that it is a skill that you can work on and become better at, and it is usually worth doing so if you are pursuing a job and you know these kinds of things will come up.

Maybe you mean that the price of Apple stock fell in some period t0 to t1, but that certainly doesn't mean the stock market is saying Apple is doing badly.  That might simply mean the stock market updated its predictions on how Apple is going to do in the future.<p>Also, every stock has some degree of volatility. Take any stock and you'll find periods that the stock went up or down. In the case of Apple, if you look at the 5-year period finishing the increase has been 270%, way over the Nasdaq average.<p>> <i>I think all this hype on stocks is a pump-and-dump operation, played by the big investment banks. ""They"" buy lots of shares, start the fire with $1000 price targets from their own analysts and when the price is high enough, they dump it, leaving some retail investor holding the bag.</i><p>Sorry, but this is naive. It's not feasible to manipulate the market over several months that way.<p>In most cases, the biggest shareholders are the company's founders and management, mutual and pension funds, and hedge funds. They would need to do a lot of (very illegal) conspiring in order to pull out that sort of thing. E.g. they would have to agree not to start selling off until a certain date.<p>Although illegal trading certainly does happen, that's usually via insider information (e.g. the investment banking division obtains secret information from Apple, and leaks it to the prop trading division). In this case, retail investors can get screwed, but so do all the banks and funds who aren't in the know.<p>If you're a retail investor, the way you lose money to brokers and market makers is typically by trading too much and thereby paying too many fees, and paying the spread too many times. Another way you lose money is when the company board & management screws you (e.g. by overpaying management, or by liberally issuing too much stock thereby diluting yours).",1361607928

I quickly switched to charAt.<p>But about the only relevant piece of this:  on an IDE, I was able to place a breakpoint, see where I'm at, what my variables look like, and make adjustments.<p>That's real life.  My original cut of this would have disqualified me.  Actually, even the cut above would disqualify me since I didn't use arrays.<p>But I need to confess.  What you see above is literally the first time I've ever reversed a string in this manner.  It's just not something I do.  And it didn't roll off the tongue so to speak. I knew I had to process the string from the end and work backwards, but it still felt like trivia and not a substantive inquisition into my skills or experience.<p>Trivial?  A bit.  It took me about 5 min.  The off by one was killing me. It hits you in two places:  the i > 0 and the charAt(i-1).",1361607702

One problem is that the kids turn to overheat if you don't undress them when going indoors.<p>2) Sweden is very rural, there is probably bad to sleep outside in Stockholm/Gothenburg compared to sleep outside the rest of the country.<p>3) Sleeping next to a street is probably a bad idea regardless temperature (the picture was taken in Copenhagen which is not in Sweden, and I didn't see any snow in the picture so no winter there)<p>4) Swedes are obsessed with safty but we tend not to calculate threat from other people as a safty matter. Around every kindergarten there are fencing keeping the kids inside but not to keep bad people out. That some evil person should take a child has the same threat level as if an alien should come by. There have been some cases of mentally-ill patients stabbing kids but that hasn't really changed anything.<p>5) There was someone in a thread calling out for Vitamin D. That's true enough but every single infant/kid in Sweden gets free Vitamin D anyway.<p>6) I think its a very cultural thing, my kids have slept longer outside, stuffed in that sleeping bag if its cold, than they ever do when napping inside.  Swedes like to think of ourselves as very outdoor, into the wild, sports, activity and health so you as a parent are supposed to be outside a lot, if you have more kids some of them are going to be tired and take that nap, wherever you are.",1361607514

Yes, Go is tempting and I'd like to try it since a lot of people get quickly into flow with Go, the ""package manager is so great"" and ""everything is just a breath of fresh air"".<p>But what I don't like: the negativity against Node and omitting some facts. In the replies of the orignal post a guy tested two (!) times Node and once it was significantly faster (v0.6) and once it had same speed (v8.0). So, why has mjijackson such different results in this thread at the top?? And maybe we should test it on real servers and not on a MBA. Moreover, we have here some micro benchmark which possibly doesn't reflect reality well. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate any benchmarking between languages but then please do it right and make no propaganda out of it. Further, Go's package manager seems to be nice but it does NOT have version control. How do you want to use this in a serious production environment. Maybe version control will come (but then tell how without loosing its flexibility) or not but this is something serious and definitely not an alternative to any server environment except for some mini services.<p>EDIT: downvoting is silly, propaganda and won't help the Go community in getting more credibility, better do some further benchmarks; otherwise this post/thread is full of distinct misinformation and should be closed",1361607440

In fact, we originally used it as a drop-in replacement for JSON.<p>As for the data vs string issue, it was designed originally to be as conveniently similar to JSON as possible - which is why you don't get back a dictionary full of NSData's which you then need to convert manually to NSString's; it does that automatically for you. This was a convenience vs correctness tradeoff. People who say it's wrong are quite right. They're very welcome to fork it, or submit patches with options to return raw NSData, or create a new wrapper - it wouldn't take a competent dev very long to re-write what we did.<p>Now, i've not used messagepack in quite a while - i've simply found that gzipped json is usually almost as good.",1361606825

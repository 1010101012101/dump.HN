Not too far off the mark?<p>In any event, this is not a case of ""getting what you pay for""; this is almost certainly a bug in Flash, not in the free software stack.  In other words, I don't suppose you believe that Flash player works better on Windows because you paid for your copy of Flash player, do you?  (On the other hand, I guess someone who would buy Microsoft Windows on the precept that ""you get what you pay for"" might just be foolish enough to shell out cash for Flash player, too.)",1257224351

918608,comment,918417,918417,0,0,JimmyL,,,"My father did little when it came to marketing (he mostly sold office buildings), but one of his few lessons about it was that one should never advertise their product as ""exclusive"". If something really is exclusive, people will start using that description all by themselves - your product will be in demand but have a very limited and controlled supply. If it's not, advertising it as ""exclusive"" just sounds cheap.<p>I find this similar to the use of the title CEO in start-ups. If you advertise that as your title, there is no reason you're doing that other than vanity. If there's one of you, you're not the CEO - you're just the guy doing things. If there's three of you, then you're just one of the guys who makes decisions. If there's twenty of you, you have a proper corporate governance structure, and all you do is manage and plan, then maybe call yourself a CEO.<p>If you're really concerned about your title between the sizes of three and twenty employees, you're worried about the wrong thing. If you really need one for some reason, call yourself Founder (if you founded the company) or President (if you have the ultimate decision-making power and preside over decisions). If you don't do either of those things, put the words ""Senior"" or ""Director of"" in front of what you actually do and speak like you've got some authority.",1257222981

The children already born show us what the expected number of high school students are in various years, but the number of high school students in the United States, which is expected to begin declining in a few years, isn't the whole story.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/education/09admissions.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&hp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/education/09admissions.htm...</a><p>First of all, if more students who begin high school go on to college, there will be more applicants to college even with a declining number of high school students. And that is the trend in the United States and worldwide.<p>Second, colleges in the United States accept applications from all over the world, so it is quite possible that demographic trends in the United States will not be the main influence on how many students apply to college. The cohorts of high-school-age students are still increasing in size in some countries (NOT most of Europe).<p>Third, even if the number of applicants to colleges overall stays the same, or even declines, the number of applicants to the most competitive colleges may still increase. The trend around the world is a ""flight to quality"" of students trying to get into the best college they can in increasing numbers, and increasing their consensus about which colleges to put at the top of their application lists. I do not expect college admission to be any easier for my youngest child than for my oldest child, even though she is part of a smaller birth cohort in the United States.<p>And now I would add to this that at the very most selective colleges that have just announced new financial aid plans, next year's (and the following year's) crush of applicants will be larger than ever. When colleges that are already acknowledged to be great colleges start reducing their net cost down to what the majority of families in the United States can afford, those colleges will receive more applications from all parts of the United States, and very likely from all over the world.<p>The Economist magazine published a brief article about these trends in April 2008.<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/world/na/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11058525&CFID=4596233&CFTOKEN=12382953"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/world/na/displaystory.cfm?story_id=...</a>",1257222513

You have ""a lead developer"" and an ex CTO that screwed your company, so I assume you (a) didn't found that company and (b) don't lead a dev team. Once you typed the letters C++.<p>* You really, really dislike Apple. As evidence for that, I submit the fact that you (a) have never agreed with any pro-Apple comment here, (b) said you have an irrational dislike for the platform, (c) haven't used it enough to make sense in an argument about how app focus works on OS X, and (d) tried to win an argument about how overpriced Apple hardware is by linking to what appears to be the worst-reviewed input device on NewEgg.<p>* Your dislike for Apple currently constitutes the majority of all your comment-words on HN.<p>I have no problem arguing with you on how effective software protection could or couldn't be on a standardized ISA with a tiny number of valid build configurations, or how microarchitectural profiling works, or what the parameters are for a ""win"" for Apple in this cat-and-mouse game are.<p>I fully accept that you might win that argument; I feel comfortable with my position, though, with some fair amount of practical experience to back it.

As I go through people, I find that publicity is never a real indicator of somebody's success. Most people who're really good at what they do never learn to promote themselves; a lot of mediocre people develop the skills and take advantage of media laziness to get mentions.<p>I've never liked people that pull age. I remember when I was thirteen pretending to be in high school because I thought that high school was a big age on the Internet; within a year I'd started to lie about being a college student because I didn't want to be treated differently than the people I talked to. As a result, when I see people whose web pages brand themselves as HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT first and CEO second and don't list any real accomplishments, I feel a sort of sneer, because I know there're just as many people that age who're quietly learning to do things till they become prodigies at the age of 25.<p>It is fun, though, when somebody discovers your age and fawns over you like you're some little darling prodigy. Not a wholesome fun, more like a smirking ""You care more about my age than what I've done?""

For one, schools, at least at the top, admit students in the context of the class and not necessarily on the basis of individual merit.  This explains in part why students at a school like Harvard are not uniform 4.0 2400 students.  There is value in diversity, so admissions committee will select students from different family backgrounds, states, race, etc. and adjust their gpa/sat requirements accordingly.<p>Second, I disagree with the author's premise that students are motivated to apply to top schools because of the per student resources spent.  I'm sure this has some residual effect, but the REAL value added by going to a top school are the fellow students, reputation, and post-graduation opportunities.  There is not much difference in your large 100+ student general econ class from one school to another.<p>I wonder instead if the increase in selectivity is due more in part to simple population ratios.  Baby boomer offspring have been hitting the college circuit for the past few years which accounts for the large increases in applicants.  It also helps explain the contrast in selectivity at the high and low ends of the spectrum.",1257221133

A language where Joda is the most convenient option, where all numerical quantities have units, and you have to make an explicit option to do ""unsafe"" things. Naturally, the goal of the language is to do as few unsafe operations as possible.<p>I think lisp is a good example: Most lisps have a full numeric tower that automatically converts between ints and bignums and ratios as appropriate. You don't have to think about the floating-point representation of 0.3 unless you wrote (double 0.3) in your code somewhere. Correctness should be the default, because it's much easier to trade some correctness for performance. Going the other way is much harder, and most people don't need performance.<p>This goes a long way, but now I notice the biggest obstacle is ""legacy systems"". The only time I get in trouble with the Clojure numeric tower is when I want to store a Ratio in the DB.",1257220817

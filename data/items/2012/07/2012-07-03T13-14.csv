If so, what license does that resold portion now fall under?  Doubtless, getting a hold of the original GPL distribution should be relatively trivial, but suppose the code was tweaked and not resold?  Now that may seem unlikely, but suppose a vendor added and tweaked some stuff, sold it under GPL to a ""straw"" reseller, who then proceeded to strip the license terms and resell without the source code?<p>I am not a big GPL/Open Source guy, but since Copyleft is derived from Copyright (from which software license arise) an attack on one is an attack on all...<p>My real issue is that while the EU court is going about invalidating licenses (regardless of their intent, and whether or not their intent is ""good"") unforeseen consequences may ensue.<p>Disclaimer: I am no legal expert.",1341323944

So tremendous that it'll never happen in a large scale: either downloadable games are somehow made excempt via some sort of contract, or games will continue their shift towards being SaaS, ie. you may resell Diablo 3, but you can't resell your Battle.net account which is strictly required for playing the game.<p>The publishers in the US <i>hate</i> the retail used games market with a fiery passion (and it's not hard to understand why). And by and large I think very few people make use of that, most people -- I'm extrapolating from myself here -- are going to be too lazy to carry their games to GameStop for a couple of bucks, and most buyers are going to be too wary of complications with a used game to save a few bucks.<p>A digital download used games market would be way more convenient for both sellers and buyers.

Of course Xavi gets the ball the most, he plays the point of a diamond midfield, or the ""trequatrista"" role. Since the point of soccer is to move forward, he is in the position most likely to touch the ball the most (middle of the pitch). The left back (Jordi Alba in this year's Euro) won't touch the ball too much ... because he plays left back.<p>Similarly, for Italy, I don't need any graph theory to know that Pirlo gets the ball the most because (A) he's their best player and (B) because he plays in a deep position in the midfield so it's easy for him to get the ball from the goalkeeper, defenders, or other midfielders.<p>Long story short - teams set themselves up so their best players get the ball the most.

Sure it's generally a good statistic, as is possession, but many other factors count and completely different styles can be equally successful.<p>People tend to overreact to the latest result.<p>Spain's biggest success was being able to accommodate to a system without a reference striker (Villa being injured). Puyol was also out and Sergio Ramos played very well as CB, leaving Arbeloa as RB despite being a dead spot supporting the attack. Xabi Alonso had a lot fewer of his long pin-point passes (his best quality) and had a more defensive role, Iniesta held the ball more to link Xavi and Silva. All in all it was very surprising that they won despite missing two of their very best players for the tournament.

You can go directly to them if you have a problem, no matter where you bought it. Thats not so in the case of the Gewhrleistung.

4193873,comment,4189811,4193192,1,0,blahbap,,,"This whole discussion is about MVC. In order to argue about MVC we should have a common understanding of the principles of MVC. MVC was invented by Trygve Reenskaug. His definition of MVC is both consistent and readily accessible. Therefore I have repeatedly referred to him for a definition of the components of MVC. Surprisingly, many of the posters don't seem to regard the inventor of MVC as much of an authority on MVC, preferring instead to come up with their own definitions.<p>You have just provided a new definition of a view:<p>""A view is just an interface layer. Whether it's interfacing to a human or not is irrelevant""<p>If this definition suits your application, good for you. But you are no longer talking about MVC.",1341321029

There are some experiments that indirectly show that the Neutrinos travel almost at light speed. (For example, the light and neutrinos from a supernova arrive here with a very little time difference.)<p>* HB: There experiments in the ATLAS, CMS and Tevatron show that there is happening something very strange at 120-130 GeV. There are a lot of experiments were the results are modified slightly with the existence of the HB. Those experiments give an indirect ""proof"" of the existence and an estimation of the mass of the HB.<p>Consensus<p>* FTLN: Almost everybody in the physics community believed that the FTLN experiment has same error (probably even the authors), but most would have been very happy to see that the experiment was true, because that means that there is a big new theory to create and explore. But physic is (in the long term) driven by experiments and so far there are no confirmations of the FTLN and the authors have apparently found where the error was.<p>* HB: Almost everybody in the physics community believed that the HB exists, the discussion is about which version is the correct (how many kinds of HB are there, the exact properties, or that there is some even more strange that the HB). But physic is (in the long term) driven by experiments and so far there is only some 3.5-sigma ""evidence"" (that is really a lot of evidence) and probably in lest than two years there will be one (or two) 5-sigma measurements that are needed to proclaim a discovery.",1341320978

Yes, the remark is true, but this just means that we lack higher-level tools above DOM/CSS/JS.<p>For your second point, I somewhat disagree. JS is now quite efficient. Not CUDA fast yet, sure, but much faster than, say, Python, VB, and often much more memory-efficient than Java. To the point that some video games have been automatically recompiled from C/C++ to JavaScript (through Emscripten) and work quite nicely. Similarly, DOM/CSS are inefficient for really low-level stuff, but suddenly become pretty efficient for animations, for instance.<p>And, really, the biggest argument for keeping the DOM is not technology, but community: many people know how to use it to do cool stuff.<p>But yes, canvas + JS or WebGL + JS are also available, for applications that require them.",1341320804

4193857,comment,4193091,4193520,8,0,jessriedel,,,"> How do they know its the Higgs?<p>Woit's comment is a pretty succinct explanation:<p>> The standard model gives very specific predictions for the behavior of the Higgs, which are fixed by the distinctive properties of the Higgs field (spontaneous breaking of the SU(2) gauge symmetry fixes how it interacts with gauge fields, giving mass to fermions fixes its interaction with them). These predictions have for a long long time shown that if the Higgs mass is 125 GeV, it could not be observed until the energies and luminosities of the LHC were available, and then it should be seen with certain specific signal sizes in certain specific decay channels.<p>> What the LHC experiments are seeing is, after decades of no such signal in these and similar channels, signals appearing in just the right channels, with roughly the right signal size. If this isnt a Higgs, its something very like it.<p><a href=""http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=4809&cpage=1#comment-115426"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=4809&cpa...</a>",1341320735

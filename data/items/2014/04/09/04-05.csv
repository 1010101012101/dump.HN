Then at the very minimum you should pass the classes and eventually have what all deep thinkers all over the world have, a diploma.<p>If it&#x27;s at all possible for you to get through college without going into debt with student loans then stick it out.

The single most effective way to get a salary raise is to show how much you&#x27;re worth on the market, ie, get an outside offer. Use this tactic carefully.<p>3. My unscientific method is to value stock vesting at Series A companies at 40% of face value due to them being high-risk assets.<p>Worth to VC = 1% / 4 years vesting = 0.25% / year * $12M = $30k / year.<p>Worth to you, adjustment for being a high-risk asset: ($30k / year) * 40% = $12.5k / year.<p>That&#x27;s how much your equity is worth, maybe a bit more since you have additional traction.",1397018266

I joined right after the company got a seed round from a VC of 3M, with post-money valuation 12M.<p>At the time there was just the founder, and I joined together with 3 other guys (all developers). The deal for me was a bit more than 1% of incentive stock options for a 40% salary cut, with the &quot;very vague&quot; promise that the salary would have been brought to market rate at some point, if things went well.<p>Now, one year later, we&#x27;re doing quite good, we&#x27;re having a bit of traction and in SV there are 3 people in the engineering department (plus some marketing guys): the founder, me and one of the other initial guys.<p>And here comes the interesting part: the rest of the dev team (~10 people) is in a foreign country with cheap cost of labor. The founder, immigrating from Europe a few years ago, has maintained some very good connections with talent there: I&#x27;m telling you, those guys are good and they ask roughly 30% of what a comparable developer would ask here, and they&#x27;re happy with that.<p>I wasn&#x27;t aware of this plan originally, and now whenever I give a hint about the raise (especially lately since we might be close to another round of funding), I get the clear impression that it&#x27;s not going to happen, considering the goldmine of talent abroad that he has found, and that with my raise he could easily buy another developer for a year.<p>Despite liking this job a lot, it is very hard for me to stare at what I&#x27;m losing, especially because the equity is not that great and my technical skills and managing capabilities have improved <i>a lot</i> (seriously, a dramatic improvement) during this past year, so if I changed job I might be able to easily negotiate a 20% (or more) of what I was making before joining the startup, bringing me to an effective current salary cut of more than 50%!<p>What would you do?",1397017590

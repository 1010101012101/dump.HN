2501407,comment,2499350,2499566,2,0,seanharper,,,"Did you actually read dodd frank?  Because you are completely wrong about what it says.  The Durbin amendment to Dodd Frank is a reduction of interchange fees for <i>debit cards</i> issued by <i>large banks</i>.  It impacts ~50% of debit cards, which are about ~30% of total cards, so 15% of cards in total.  And it reduces those fees by 60-80% (so from around 1.5% to < 1%).  As a result, it is a very minimal financial hit to the banks who ultimately receive the interchange revenues.<p>Furthermore, Durbin amendment will not survive.  I will bet anyone on this - the banks are running a very aggressive FUD campaign which I suspect will work.  It sucks, but that's what is what's happening.<p>Also, keep in mind that the fees being legislated by Dodd Frnak are the interchange fees that are actually the most significant expense for payments companies such as square, so it could improve their profitability a lot.  It could also allow them to lower their fees and still make money, which coud increase adoption.<p>Durbin amendment, if it survives, is a positive for Square and every other payments company.  It is a negative for the banks that ISSUE debit cards (basically Chase, Citi and BofA).",1304192872

There was absolutely no segregation and the flow of ideas were amazing, problems got reported and were acted upon fast, it was very agile company. I really enjoyed working there and so did other employees.<p>The other company (auto parts manufacturer as well) had similar badge system as discussed in the article, employees with lowest ranking badge were considered the ""lowest class"", no one except their immediate supervisor talked to them and listened to them. This segregation meant they had no incentive to work intelligently or report problems.

2501359,comment,2500522,2500522,1,0,ScottBurson,,,"John Walker's PATO (described in the post) seems like it might be a good idea.<p>Here, just to brainstorm a little, is another idea I was kicking around the other day.  I'll call it the Rational Software Patent Alliance.  The basic idea is that any patent dispute between two RSPA members is settled by binding arbitration performed by the RSPA.  Unlike the current system which foists technical decisions of obviousness and infringement on judges and juries who are not competent to make these decisions, the RSPA arbitration team consists entirely of experienced (and very well paid) developers and computer scientists.  The arb team will form its own opinion of the validity of a patent, very much including its judgment of the obviousness of same; and everyone should know that only a minority, possibly a small minority, of software patents issued by the PTO are likely to pass the much higher bar of the RSPA.<p>Of course, there's some risk that a patent holder, unhappy with their patent being considered invalid by the RSPA, would quit the organization so they could sue another RSPA member in the courts.  To deter this behavior, we say that an entity can join the RSPA only once; you can't get back in after leaving, and what's more, if someone acquires you after you leave, <i>they</i> can't join the RSPA either, and if they're already a member, they're kicked out.<p>The incentive to join RSPA is simple: it removes some fraction of the risk of being sued -- said fraction being a function of how many other companies join -- and it wouldn't be expensive unless you actually avail yourself of the arbitration process, and even that would be far cheaper than litigation.<p>I think this idea is actually complementary to PATO, as it's an idea about how members should resolve disputes among themselves, where PATO is more about how members should help one another in disputes with nonmembers.  Walker suggests that PATO members should never be able to assert patent rights against other members, but I think that's going to be a harder sell than what I'm proposing, where companies do have some chance of protecting their real innovations from other members.  I think there has to be some chance of that if we're going to get the big players -- Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, etc. -- to join.<p>So I think there should be one entity -- and ""PATO"" is definitely a better name than ""RSPA"" :-) -- that has both of these functions, to help defend members against nonmembers, and to arbitrate disputes between members.<p>Alas, neither of these functions does a good job of addressing the NPE problem, as NPEs would obviously never join such an alliance, and they aren't vulnerable to countersuits precisely because they're non-practicing.  I think if anyone is going to fix the NPE problem, it's going to have to be Congress.",1304191895

Struggling to scrape by on a dollar a day, and wondering where your next meal is going to come from must be pretty awful. Perhaps more people should do volunteer work to realise just how lucky we have it in the west. I think that by being wealthier, you can ""move up"" Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs[1], and if you reach 'self-actualisation' i.e. you are intellectually fulfilled, have pride in your work and accomplishments etc., that that is it's own kind of happiness. I agree that you are never going to achieve any kind of happiness by simply pursuing some arbitrary dollar amount. That is a fool's game. Beyond a certain point increasing your bank account balance is a meaningless exercise.<p>The second and third paragraph mention some things are are an unfortunate byproduct of an industrialsed nation. They are also arguably unnecessary - the means are there to combat obesity, products made by slave labour, destruction of the environment etc. I don't really have a good answer for these. It's important to note that some of these things can happen in a poor country too - I remember in the movie ""Black Hawk Down"" that the soldiers were admiring the lovely view of the ocean, but they were warned to not go in as it was extremely polluted. It probably wasn't the Somalians that polluted it though!<p><i>""Your point appears to be that financial innovation (money pursuits) can and sometimes do lead to benefits for society.""</i> It all depends. If you are a seller of Credit Default Swaps in Goldman Sachs circa 2006, you probably know in your heart and soul that what you are doing is highly destructive to society. But dammit, you need to hit your annual bonus, so you sell, sell, sell. Good inventions can be twisted in destructive ways.<p>All human systems and artefacts are imperfect. They are also morally-neutral. Think of nuclear power. When it was discovered, the idea was to bring really cheap electricity to the masses. As it turned out, the electricity wasn't cheap and the most horrific weapon ever created was unleashed. Or even a car - you can use a car to help an elderly neighbour get into town, or use it to escape from a bank robbery. And so on.<p>""<i>As a counter, I'll offer this up. The great scientific discoveries of the world were not done for money. Newton would not have been a better mathematician had he been paid more. Human progress, largely, comes from people who like to solve problems. Who are curious about the world and want to understand it. A society that gives such people the means to pursue their intellectual passions is one that progresses.</i>""<p>True - but one must also pay the bills. You could work on your passion with great dedication and focus, if only for that pesky matter of money. Look at pg - he solved his money problem by selling Viaweb, and used his newfound time and wealth to help young up and coming entrepreneurs to launch and grow their businesses. If you ever see pictures of him, you know he just loves every minute of what he does. He does a great job because he cares deeply about nurturing entrepreneurship. But if he didn't have the time and money to do YC and had urgent bills to pay, things would be different and the world would be a worse off. Also, watch ""The Secret History of Silicon Valley"". Steve Blank details how Silicon Valley wouldn't exist today without defense funding from the government. We wouldn't be having this conversation if the US didn't spend so much on military research!<p>On a related note, I was watching the BBC one morning and the question was posed to (I think) a historian: why couldn't the renaissance have happened in England? He gave two reasons, one was that England at the time was consumed in civil war, and the other was that the Catholic church was a major patron of the arts. Money again. By having such a wealthy benefactor willing to fund them, artists like da Vinci could create works of art like <i>La Pieta</i>[3]. A similar virtuous cycle exists today in Silicon Valley, with investors willing to place big bets on tech innovations that may or may not work. See the parallel? Those with money, but less skill (the Church, VCs) are willing to fund those with the skill, but not the money (hackers, artists).<p>""<i>I would argue that a better system needs to be developed because the downsides to the pursuit of money are quite bad and will lead to a world with it's resources plundered.</i>""<p>Money, stock and bond markets are just a human construct that reflects human faults and failings, mood swings and fear and greed. Although it's imperfect, the capitalistic system is the best system we've come up with so far. It emulates evolution, which is probably why it beats communism and other alternatives. Hopefully it will continue to evolve to the betterment of all.<p>On the lack of money causing evil, just look at the piracy situation off the coast in Somalia. There is no jobs or way of earning a decent wage there. So they turn to piracy as it's they only way to actually make money in that unfortunate country.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ruralhealth.utas.edu.au/comm-lead/images/Maslows-needs-Pyramid.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ruralhealth.utas.edu.au/comm-lead/images/Maslows-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC_RxWN_xo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC_RxWN_xo</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://pwlawrence.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Michelangelos_Pieta_5450_cropncleaned.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pwlawrence.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/M...</a>",1304191824

Given that one can make a job better or worse in zillions of ways, mandating a minimum wage probably makes both the employer <i>and</i> the employee worse off compared to allowing them to reach a free mutual agreement on terms.<p>It might make employees worse off by reducing their hours, by reducing the training budget, reducing flexibility of work hours, reducing job security...or by reducing perks such as free food.<p>Here's an example: Suppose you're running a videogame company and you need to <i>test</i> your new videogame. If it were legal, one strategy might be to pay a small army of junior-high kids, say, $1/hour to test your videogame after school. The kids would go for it because they get the ability to play hot new video games in a relaxing, low-pressure environment, with free snacks and drinks and even a small amount of pay, where ordinarily it would <i>cost</i> them money to play videogames. As a side benefit, they'd get valuable exposure to the work environment, make business contacts, possibly discover a new career.<p>Now pass laws demanding a minimum wage. The junior high kids are priced out of the market; if you have to pay a large wage you'll hire fewer but more qualified people rather than more, less qualified people. Now it's much harder to get started in the field. A $13/hour testing job is <i>a different job</i> than the $1/hour job. More stressful, harder to get, and quite possibly less effective.<p>So change your quote to ""You'd prefer to take less (in exchange for offsetting benefits that are more valuable to you than to me), but offering you that deal would be <i>illegal</i>!""",1304191607

Unless your ISP uses some sort of digital certificates, or authenticates you based on physical connectivity (like port number on switch, DSLAM or whatever), your ISP stores your password in <i>plain text</i>. And that - controversially - is a Good Thing.<p>It's because your ISP had decided that connection-level security is way weaker than password storage security.

Since Lucid, the behavior of Ubuntu has shifted somewhat to match that of Mac OS X. Traditionally, buttons defaulted to the right hand corner of the window rather than the left and multi-touch tapping has been remapped to match OS X's style (two finger right click, three finger middle). Compiz has the window picker plugin similar to Expos along with a cover flow-like window switcher. Now you've got he Unity Launcher with Spotlight/Quicksilver/Gnome-Do functionality. The Add/Remove Applications tool has been around since Breezy in 2005, predating even the iPhone App Store, and provided the same functions as the Software Center and the Mac App Store.<p>GNOME can be tweaked to look like OS X or Windows or whatever you want, but it's because you can mix and match things like themes and window managers. If you just used vanilla GNOME 2.x with Metacity, I don't think you'd find much of a similarity.<p>You could say that Ubuntu or GNOME3 borrows functions or aesthetics from other contemporary desktop environments, but GNOME ""forever been an Apple Copy?""",1304190809

2501286,comment,2500495,2500495,1,0,tzs,,,"I see many recommendations here, and in prior discussions, to use bcrypt. Having finally actually looked up how bcrypt works, I have two concerns.<p>1. It uses Blowfish, but it modifies how the key schedule and S-boxes are set up. Doesn't that essentially make it no longer Blowfish, but rather Blowfish inspired? Blowfish has a long history and has been well studied. By fiddling with it, don't they throw that out?<p>2. Suppose you are storing passwords encrypted using bcrypt with a cost factor of n. You decide to increase that to m. How do you compute the new hashes for existing passwords? From the description of the algorithm in their paper, it looks to me like you can only do this by having the original, plaintext password. Thus you can only strengthen a stored password when the user logs in, so you can compute the new stored password.<p>Both of the above issues could be addressed by doing something like the following. What advantages does bcrypt have over something like this?<p><pre><code>    hash_password(start, cost, salt, pass)
        h = pass
        for i = start to cost
            h = sha256(i . "":"" . salt . "":"" . h)
        return h
</code></pre>
To store password p1, with salt s1, and cost c1, compute h1=hash_password(1,c1,s1,p1). Store (c1,s1,h1).<p>To later update this to a higher cost, c2, compute h2=hash_password(c1+1,c2,s1,h1), and store (c2,s1,h2).",1304190366

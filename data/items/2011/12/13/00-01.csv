3345837,comment,3345159,3345558,3,0,cheald,,,"My impression is that the biggest difference is automated two-way bindings between views and models. Under Backbone, you have to do that binding manually. With Ember, this means that you don't have to always be explicitly triggering events to cause view re-rendering or invoking persistence callbacks from your views to trigger model saves.<p>The ""computed properties"" is also nice; it looks to enable the decorator pattern on models pretty trivially in the context of the two-way bindings, which generally does a lot for producing clean code.<p>My gut is that this is ""Backbone biased towards a specific flavor of application design"". Backbone is awesome, but by its own admission, is more of collective toolset than a full-blown framework. Ember looks like it's sort of a midpoint between Backbone's spartan foundation and Sproutcore's kitchen-sink framework. I'm excited to try it out.",1323737981

In many cases, that's because they don't live in a society with lots of economic mobility and they're just trying to survive selling trinkets on the street or finding a way to provide some kind of service to their neighbors for money. It may even be in the gray market or a completely informal economy.<p>I know that's not the typical HN / tech view of a startup, but the fact is that most of the people on the planet can't always depend on a monolithic employer to give them a paycheck in exchange for their time.",1323737922

If someone has an office to go to but also works from home they will often not consider creating <i>another</i> workspace at home and that will result in their home life and work life ""merging"". For a startup having your home life and work life being one and the same is relatively normal (again in my experience at least) but with a ""normal"" job most people don't want that.

It was fairly clear that these people worked remotely because they were so valuable, and working from home was the perk they demanded as compensation.<p>As far as I can tell, all people are aware that working from home is a big benefit to the employee;    but from what I've seen?   people who work from home because they are good enough that they get the working conditions they demand don't get laid off.<p>I mean, from what I've seen, the employer looks at it as compensation, too;  so you might be right that if two people with the same skill and the same pay worked at the same company, one working from home and the other in the office, the one working from home might get let go of first.   But if the work from home person is more skilled or is getting paid less (which is usually the case)  then they are not more likely to get laid off.<p>(As a side note,  personally I think that getting laid off in the first round is almost always the best outcome for an employee.  In the first round, if it is a large company, there are usually severance packages.  This package gets smaller in subsequent rounds.   Also, if you don't get laid off?  well, they reduced the number of workers, but not the amount of work that needs to be done.  It's no fun.)",1323737387

I think politicians <i>can</i> ignore something that ""a majority of the Internet-using population"" knows.  As long as the ""mainstream"" media (i.e. television) chooses not to pick it up, the politicians won't be forced to answer for themselves.<p>b. If there is opposition to SOPA, either the public media spin will be controlled by politicians announcing that the draft law has been modified ""in response to"" the concerns/opposition/protests, or ""SOPA"" will be defeated but the powers that want it passed will regroup and send it through again next year under a different name.<p>c. If there's room to argue that Wikipedia is exaggerating the threat, then that is what will be publicly argued when this story breaks.  This might not turn out so positively for Wikipedia (or negatively for SOPA):  after all, which side has more experience and resources to put towards controlling the public debate?  And that's before we consider the possibility that someone will seriously suggest that it would be <i>better</i> for Wikipedia to be censored.<p>Don't read (b), in particular, as defeatism:  I understand that this is a war and that we have to fight the current battle as well as future ones.

But in cases where you need only a part of the functionality of this tool, the complexity bites you as all the unneeded functionality (along its cost) is forced on you.<p>What sort of ""overall complexity"" does having several data structures in code introduce? As Rich Hickey says in his talk, complexity is not about cardinality.<p>In Clojure's model, the elements are distinct, and as such there is more simplicity in the system than in lisps where you have to understand the difference (""untangle"" the complexity) between several different uses of lists to get anywhere.<p>I also think having several datastructures makes code easier to read due to the visual differences, but that's a separate discussion. :)",1319269842

3143050,comment,3142869,3142869,6,0,Helianthus,,,"I'm seeing a lot of posts on HN supportive of Bitcoin, and honestly, I just don't get it.  Someone explain.<p>1) I don't see that Bitcoin can escape any boom-bust cycle.  I don't.  Arguably the dollar can't either, but I think that's part of my point: that's with people _trying_ to regulate it.  Bitcoin ultimately has a finite economy, which means that it's only stable if it is constantly deflationary (unless the population size stays the same I guess?  I'm not going to make _that_ assumption) and _that_ motivates hoarding, which locks down currency.<p>You can _maybe_ construct some differential equation where the amount of hoarding is balanced out by the amount of 'cashing out' as people give up hoarding to spend freely, but that's a _heck_ of a wild guess to base a currency on.  And anything _less than that perfection_ will inevitably result in boom-bust: freeze until you sell your dough, therefore simultaneous motivation to sell, therefore flooding of market, therefore crash.  Which tangentially brings up:<p>2) In the above example, Bitcoin is (like any other currency) a surrogate of value for the things you can _do_ with it, which tells us that value lies outside of currency altogether and that currency is just a measuring stick.  And therefore...<p>3) Bitcoin is essentially _still_ a fiat currency, but without the benefits of, you know, a significant support base.  Sorry, you can go into almost any bank in the world and exchange an American dollar for local coin.  I'd rather just _abolish money_ than supplant it with even _more_ imaginary money.<p>Sure, some counterculture activity subsists on Bitcoin.  Sure, it's a neat thought experiment.  But I can't see it becoming practical (read: successful).",1319266943

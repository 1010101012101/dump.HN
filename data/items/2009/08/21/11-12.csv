777352,comment,777066,777098,0,0,dkersten,,,"Yeah, I find it draining when working too long on the same thing and get distracted. I can (and do) work for long periods of time, but I feel it after and it makes me less efficient overall. I think working for many short bursts throughout the day lets me get a lot more done (and this is how I work on my own projects, eg during weekends: work for 1 to 4 hours (depending on the task), 1-3 hours off, 1-4 hours on etc and at the end of the day, I'll have racked up 5 or 6 hours of good, highly productive, efficient work. If I do 8 hours straight, I'm guessing only about 2 are actually efficient. When I was in uni, I often leave my assignments until the last day (BUT think about them before hand) and then sit down for maybe four blocks of 1.5 hours and get them done in 6 hours of work - compared to people trying to sit down for full days and spending a lot lot longer on them..<p>I agree - commuting means I'm tired before I even start. (Being a night person means I'm tired when I get up for the day job in the morning too, but thats another matter).<p>The full day off is important to me, but probably a lot less if I didn't get drained from doing 8 hour days.<p>PS: forgive my bad comment structure, its Friday, long and busy week, I'm pretty drained right now.. see above..",1250855625

By identifying the right people to lend money to, banks can offer the people whose money the take an interest rate.<p>I still agree that there is a market for a better bank.<p>I remember an example from the book ""Why not?"" where a bank (or something like that) offered to automatically adapt their customers to the best current interest rate and making a killing with it.

The only exception is when you move all logic in tags, but even then logic gets mixed with presentation (just not in the main template), and the downside is that a tag is like a black-box ... if the scope is not clear, you have no way of knowing what it produces by not looking over its code (CSS files in ASP.NET end up containing general classes in most cases because of that).<p>That's because the presentation layer requires logic, for example ... if this happens, then show this, else show that. Or to show the breadcrumb, iterate through this list. Or is this DateTime value in UTC? Then show it in the user's locale. That's logic and it's a lot more then a template with holes in it to fill.<p>And where is this logic supposed to go if not in the presentation layer?<p>All the designers I worked with also knew a programming language (at a superficial level at least) and where quite capable of coding complex logic in Javascript (which is also part of the presentation layer). Our fear is that designers don't understand a more complex language, but how many of you worked with such people? (since web-design is all about the end-product, I can't imagine a good designer that can't handle logic). And even if the language guards against shooting yourself in the foot you can always find creative ways to fuck up.",1250853046

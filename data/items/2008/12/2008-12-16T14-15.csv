It's more common in math than in other fields, and mathematicians peak earlier than, say, writers (35, as opposed to 55, would be my guesses) but it's not actually the norm for a mathematician to do his best work in his 20s. Those stories are cases of the exception proving the rule.",1229439590
399521,comment,399365,399484,0,0,Retric,,,"Bond's don't change rate when the company get's into trouble the cost of new bonds goes up.<p>Student loans are normally fixed interest rate loans and they only charge penalty's when your late in paying them.<p>The problem with increasing rates when people get into trouble is it tends to force more people over the cliff.  Let's say you owe 20k at 10% and make 50k/year.  You get hospitalized for 5k and your old and new rate becomes 33%. You have gone from a 2k /year to 5k/year when you need to borrow 5k more.  If the company lending you 5k wants to charge you 33% interest that's fine you can focus on paying them back first and get free of debt but when everyone starts raising your rates while your in trouble it's almost impossible to get out of the hole.<p>PS: Not to mention demonstrating a lack of good credit is an ill defined concept.  Loss of a job reduces credit worthiness even if you make all your payments.",1229439565

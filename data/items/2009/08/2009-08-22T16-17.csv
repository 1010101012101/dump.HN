We're doing Agile development on RoR.<p>My eventual role would be a scrum master but my college major was international business. No SC background whatsoever.<p>At the moment I'm still in training and playing a role of a ""front-end developer"" in which I do all the HTML markup and CSS design in HAML and SASS.<p>My pair is a coder who handles all the back-end coding and so there's really inequality in our time spent.<p>What should I do to keep up with stuffs? A lack of CS foundation really prevents me from doing all the back-end stuffs but after a while I'm now able to comprehend most of the code.<p>Should I spend more time on stuffs like SEO, analytics, design, or invest more in RoR and tougher things?

This is bigger than a lot of people's max monitor resolution. It is certainly bigger than I prefer to keep my browser. I tend to keep mine around 950px.<p>The text on the homepage is very jarring. Preferably, use only one font size and color for any given paragraph. At most, use two.<p>The table for displaying info on books give a huge amount of space to information which seems to be relatively unimportant. Is the number of words (especially when it varies by only about +- 75) really that important? If you trimmed it down, you could display information on a lot more books on a single page. I hate paging through information, and most users won't even go past the first page (think about how you use Google or Amazon... how many pages are you typically willing to look through?). Some sort of categorization/tagging may also be in order.<p>The ""get started"" link on the homepage really needs to contain more information. If you want your users to start there, you should give them something more. I never start with signing up. I start with learning about the service.<p>The about page mentions that you can unlimited students in your account, but it's not at all clear what it means to have an account and what it means to have students in it. You are giving details, but I'm not clear on the basics, even after browsing around for 10 minutes. I've visited every page on your site and I still couldn't tell you what the day-to-day use of your site will be like.<p>I don't mean to criticize.

I think I will try Skritter for #3.<p>I coded in the very early days of my website and moved to the business side as we grew. Other HN users have posted big lists of good stuff. I want to say that you really have two big goals based on those lists:<p>1. Keep ONLY user feedback flowing to the coders and handle anything else that would otherwise fall to them. They are the engine of your company; respect that by keeping them healthy, focused and productive.<p>2. Find the next big source of growth for your company. As the business guy, although coders often contribute, this is really on you.<p>I've played around with the bulk of lists others have written in answer to your post. Here are the time intensive, low cash things that have worked for us:<p>a. SEO. The cheap place to start is long tail keywords that are highly targeted to your service. Make sure your H tags and falling paragraph content align with the terms you want. After that, you'll need inbound links from non-spammy website. $100 a month can from textlinkads can help. If you are too poor for that, you'll need to convince bloggers to write about you - and to use those long tail keywords. Hard but possible.<p>b. Newsletters. These are surprisingly effective, but they are also time consuming and require a ""I am going to work this hard for 3 months"" approach to gauge true results. There are a wide range of email service providers, from ConstantContact on up. Many will let you send a few freebies out, others will let you send always free under a certain limit. This is great if you have a small list. Shop around, call the owner of one, explain your situation and negotiate for a little more head room. Remember, they make money on volume, so if they can show you ROI free early, they'll win too.<p>My parting advice is, dig in. Give whatever you decide to try your full effort. At the start it will feel frustrating and ineffective. Let it snow ball. Come in with the mindset that ""this will work"" and ""I will not let my company down by failing to make this work"". Then it will.",1250959931

1. Working on business relationships (networking, finding potential partners or customers, customer support, etc.)<p>2. Miscellaneous busy work related to programming.  A lot of the work involved in programming can be done by someone who can't program, if you're decently technical.  Examples: Testing/QA (help maintain a bug list), research and compilation (finding or creating relevant databases or lists), seeking relevant forums online and posting to them, etc.<p>Also, you say that traditional marketing isn't going to have a positive ROI.  You need to figure out what IS going to have a good ROI, and work on that!<p>Two suggestions about your website:<p>1. You need a pricing page on your website... I can't figure out how much your service costs after the free trial.<p>2. I'm glad you mention that any input device, such as a pen tablet, can be used.  I think you should offer a page of suggested devices (and links to buy them -- get commission if you can) because it seems like that kind of investment is a no-brainer for someone who is serious about learning Chinese. Skype does/did that because Skype works much better for people with a good headset microphone. Similarly, someone is going to learn to write Chinese better if they can actually use a pen-like device while practicing.",1250958009
779459,comment,778366,778670,0,0,dasil003,,,"Absolutely true.  I don't think a college degree has any correlation to programming skill at all.  I completed an MIT-based CS curriculum with all graduate-level classes my senior year.  Had I not also been working full time as a web developer, and dabbling in the web since 1993, my degree would have made me virtually unhirable as a web developer.<p>On the other hand, the CS theory gives a very solid theoretical base that makes me a better programmer in all aspects of what I do.  None of this stuff is exclusively available in a CS degree, all this information is available for free online <i>if you know where to look</i>.  Most decent practitioners will pick up a lot of this stuff intuitively without formal training, but not with the same breadth or formality.<p>The stuff I did in my CS degree, such as optimizing binary code, writing a (subset of) Java compiler from scratch, and writing radiosity and monte carlo 3d renderers is demonstrative of a certain practical ability to deal with complex subjects that I consider valuable to all types of programmers.  Therefore I think a CS degree can continue to stay very relevant, as long as they stick with theoretical CS and don't turn programs into Java and C# farms.<p>That said, the skills to succeed in a theoretical CS program do not necessarily translate into the ability to get things done in a real world environment, and it would also be a mistake to use it as some sort of litmus test since a college environment is not for everyone.",1250957968

This context is particularly useful to me when I have a hard time judging the value of the comments alone simply because I know jack squat about security.<p>Similarly, if I stumble across a comment that makes a radically strange conclusion (like ""women and men should be lumped into one sports category"") and I look at who wrote it, I can remember that the commenter has made some very good points in the past and is not prone to making dumb arguments. From there I can cut a little more slack in my own mind for the argument and I can try to reach into it and see what the main point he's trying to get across is.<p>None of these approaches is fan-worshiping, nor do they involve me making an ad hominem argument. Context is absolutely useful for humans. We are inherently biased creatures for a reason. We have to make quick judgments and take shortcuts every day to deal with all of the information, and the context of others' reputation works great for this.<p>You wouldn't do a risky business deal with someone whose reputation you didn't know, would you? Well think of reading others' opinions as a kind of transaction. You take on a little risk by buying into someone's opinion. You may change your worldview just a tiny bit based on the value you place on another's comment. That is what conversations are all about. The risk comes from the possibility of adding inconsistencies, falsehoods, or improbabilities to your worldview without realizing it. We don't know all there is to know and so we cannot make perfectly objective and absolute judgments on whatever we come across.",1250957593

Doing all the business related tasks.<p>3. Doing all the customer service.<p>4. Handling all incoming e-mail.<p>5. Doing all of the social networking stuff (facebook, twitter).<p>6. Doing all of our marketing. Handling Google AdWords, banner advertising, text advertising, etc.<p>7. Dealing exclusively with our accountant.<p>8.

I'm the guy that goes to all of our relevant events.<p>11. We all come up with ideas for product development.<p>12. Blogging. I do all the blogging.<p>13. Handling payroll. I do that.<p>14. Dealing with the bank accounts. I deal directly with the small business rep at our bank.<p>15. Market research. I find out as much as I can about our competitors, what they do, etc. I also learn about our market as a whole.<p>16.

I handle all of that.<p>20. Anything that requires a phone call. Incoming or outgoing.<p>...and many other tasks as they crop up. For example, I'm the point person on setting up our new office.<p>My job is a lot more ""flexible"" so I can deal with things as they arise and take the lead. Whereas my partners (one is a designer and one is a coder) usually have to stay on task so they're not distracted. For example, we're setting up a new office as I mentioned above and it's just not feasible for either to spend time dealing with that in the middle of production. I, however, can do that.",1250957493

It IS congresses' fault.<p>I’m not in favor of the bailout/oversight plan that the Obama administration is pursuing (and which, in all fairness, the Bush administration started).  I think they should just let businesses that make stupid decisions fail and let the market take its course.  But if you are going to be prepared to bail out companies like AIG when they catastrophically screw up then you have to regulate them in a way that keeps them from taking advantage of that safety net.<p>Because otherwise you’re just giving them license to make any crazy deal that want with no fear of negative consequences. Which is what happened here.  Congress created a system in which AIG would be almost irresponsible not to make crazy loans because those loans were possibly a big financial win and they (thanks to congress) had no risk of potential loss.",1250957006

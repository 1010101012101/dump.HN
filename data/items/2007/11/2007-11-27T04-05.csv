Plus full web browsing and other (basic) desktop apps that you would expect from a low end laptop.<p>...For the same price as a Kindle (<i>including</i> a donation of a laptop to a child in a developing nation)",1196139527

To conclude that it is exponential you need some kind of analysis, like ""every user brings two, those bring two each etc"".",1196137053

* Key management<p>And for each we need many-to-many mappings with a full life cycle management including key/identity rotation, revocation and destruction and of course the resulting <i>key storage</i> problem.<p>I am likely more &quot;paranoid&quot; that you; I have over 600 keys randomly generated (normally 80 characters long unless a service can not meet my security requirements and then I dumb it down 1 char at a time until it is accepted.). I can not possibly recall any of them by memory. Each key is encrypted with a one time pad, and I secure them with two factor authentication in order to store them on my USB drive; which I wear on my neck... It took special effort for me to post this. :/<p>I change keys regularly. I keep data about each key such as the dates in order to age them, and change them on a regular basis. And they are always randomly generated with a Mersenne Twister. It is actually not paranoid, and it is ridiculous. For all of this effort; I can at best say that my password was not the reason your company was compromised and my personal data shit all over the internet. Given that most companies sell the fuck out of that data anyhow it is completely unprotected. Second given the number of databases opened up by the skeleton key of SQL injection - my password is not the lowest hanging fruit.<p>Of course this doesn&#x27;t protect against rubber hose cryptanalysis. Today of course they will taze your balls, not break your legs... So you are going to give up your keys, but not before you have been hurt like you never ever hurt in your life, so get over it. So what I am doing is not security, this is actually just <i>best practices</i> of key and identity management.<p>Few people do what I do; and I have articulated why it is still not secure (rubber hose) and hopefully it is clear why we desperately require better solutions. Everybody should be doing what I do at a minimum.",1377341456

6268289,comment,6267131,6268127,2,0,raimue,,,"In general, public/private keys can be used for the encryption itself. However, if you want to send a document to multiple recipients you would need to encrypt the whole plain text multiple times with each public key.  However, asymmetric crypto requires much more resources than symmetric crypto, as the latter is basically a XOR operation only.<p>Therefore, in implementations such as OpenPGP/PGP, a new random symmetric key is generated with which the plain text will be encrypted, for example using AES as you suggested. Afterwards, this symmetric key will be encrypted with the public key of the recipient and attached to the cipher text.<p>When sending a document to multiple recipients, you only need to encrypt the symmetric key multiple times. The symmetric key is usually short compared to the rest of the document.<p>So if you are only encrypting for a single recipient you could encrypt using the public key directly. However, it would still need more computing power. This might be negligible on modern Desktop computers with lots of computing power and even hardware crypto support, but for embedded devices such as your smartphone it&#x27;s still an important factor.<p>PS: Of course, there is more to OpenPGP/PGP such as the Web of Trust and digital signatures for verification of the sender of a document.",1377341206

You are on Y-Combinator, built on the notion of spreading risk around through diversification.<p>The DoE actually has a better record than most venture capitalists and angels, but in reality, you need a pile of failures to get a success. Failure is the engine of success, and the demand from the right that the government not do anything that might fail actually acts to increase government failure and expense, by making agencies so risk-averse that they spend way way more money on analysis and over engineering to avoid failures. That&#x27;s one reason why SpaceX can beat NASA military contractors because they design and test to try to reduce failure to zero.<p>If you care about small, effective, cheap government, it would be paradoxically better IMHO, to let the government dole out cash like a VC with the expectation of 40 failures for every 1 mammoth success.<p>What I don&#x27;t get is, people on the right never complain about all of the government failures on military spending. X-Ray lasers, planes and tanks that don&#x27;t work, crazy and kooky DARPA projects. Hundreds of billions are flushed down the toilet, trillions if you look at the disaster that is the F-35/JSF, and here they are whining about Solyndra.<p>Isn&#x27;t the huge military industrial complex a ginormous distortion of the market? Why is it so much more terrible for the government to fund early stage industry (which is relatively cheap), but perfectly ok to give huge incentives to oil companies in taxes, regulations, military and state department support, or to spend hundreds of billions on weapon systems that never get deployed or used?<p>I wonder if it has has more to do with cultural conservatism than fiscal conservatism.

This approach is appropriate where the market will only exist if enough private actors realize that they need to cooperate for the market to exist at all. BitCoin is a perfect example of a similar ecosystem. It&#x27;s a collective, distributed startup. Search tech beyond what Google is requires a similar cooperative effort.<p>Right now the CommonCrawl data set is so big and the cost of setting up all the infrastructure to work on it is so expensive, that few people have the luxury to explore how search engines might work differently.<p>I don&#x27;t know how the search algo team does its job at Google, but it would be awesome if the interface made available to them was offered as a service that anyone could build a search business off of. That would be a great first step in allowing specialized search engines for specific verticals/domains to take off.",1377339333

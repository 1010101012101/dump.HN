And of course if an average person wants TechCrunch to write about their product they will have very little chance to get any attention, but if I can get PG to ask TechCrunch, then its a different story, which is fair since they know who PG is and they know their time is not being wasted, whereas its hard to know what other people thinking... <p>They have surely had great PR and they have probably got advice on what they should do, but what they are getting back is not simply because they are willing to spend dollars on a PR firm ... and if it is, and there are such influential PR firms please introduce them to me",1194555475

77626,comment,77470,77613,0,0,yters,,,"Is there any substantial point to institutional higher education today?  The only possibilities I can think of are:
1.  Research that isn't tied down by practical concerns.
2.  Professors can help people learn the material faster than on their own.<p>1 is good, and from my very limited knowledge seems to be fairly strong, but fading, in academia.  2, of course, depends on the person, and the emphasis on grades can slow a person down, as you say.  I'm churning through the busy work right now in my courses, since grades still matter at least for their appearance.  <p>In my opinion, our educational model needs to be majorly revamped, or augmented.  I know a couple people here went to Amherst, and I quite liked what I saw on their website.",1194555215

Wait till their PR budget runs out, then we will see if the software stands on its own.",1194555037

The ""low barrier to entry"" and other stuff that's mentioned even in these comments?<p>Low cost of entry isn't really an advantage since everyone is experiencing it at once. Whom do you have an advantage over when we can all build the same website in the same amount of time and host it for the same amount of money?<p>As always, winning in this game comes down to building something unique that is also difficult for others to build, marketing, and luck. I don't think a lot people building new web apps these days understand this.",1194554428

77613,comment,77470,77600,0,0,jey,,,"A 4.0 GPA just shows that you can do all of the rote busy work and that you care about your GPA. It shows that you can memorize enough of the crap to regurgitate it on the test. Smart people can do that too, but you don't need to be smart to get a 4.0. You just need to give the professor whatever (s)he expects. If you want to do well in school, you'd do best to not think and just do exactly what you're told. This is the secret to earning a 4.0 GPA.<p>I agree that a 4.0 GPA shows ""discipline"", so if you're looking to raise an army of robots, you probably would do best to reject anyone who doesn't have a 4.0 GPA. I disagree that it indicates your ""priorities"" are straight -- all it shows is that your priorities are aligned with the priorities that are socially prescribed, not that you have your priorities figured out. Why <i>should</i> someone place a high importance on GPA? Isn't it just a waste of time and effort? Aren't happiness, learning, and curiosity more important?<p>""<i>By the way, there are people who are good at programming but not great at solving complex problem.</i>""<p>I fully agree. But I think the implication here is that people with a 4.0 are good at solving complex problems. If so, that's total bullshit. You can get through a Computer Science degree never solving any hard problem nor thinking at all. You have to copy the example the professor gives and follow his recommendation as closely as possible. If you show any creativity or thought, you will be punished.<p>People with a 4.0 who solve hard problems aren't able to solve problems <i>because</i> of their 4.0s -- they are able to solve them <i>despite</i> their 4.0s. They were able to get a 4.0 GPA without turning into a robot, now <i>that</i> is impressive!<p>If I was hiring programmers, I wouldn't dismiss someone for having a 4.0 GPA, but having a 4.0 doesn't tell me anything useful about them at all. They still have to prove themselves to me, from scratch. Having a 4.0 would put up one barrier though: they'd have to also show me that they didn't have a robot's personality.<p>/if it isn't already obvious from the acerbic tone of this post, yes, I had a bad time in the school system :)",1194553823

I'm not interested in extensive discussion about it; I might want to read a summary after it all dies down.<p>For (2) I am interested in extensive discussion, whether it's statistics, anecdotes, or just supposition.  Can people please comment on this posting only with ideas about (2) and leave the word ""cofounder"" out of it?",1194552595
77608,story,,,19,35,shayan,"Ask YC: What did YC see in Disqus? why are they special?",,"I used Disqus and liked it, and would like to congratulate them on their recent launch.  But this is a very competitive market.  Disqus is doing a good job, but I am not too clear how (in a major way) they differentiate from others.  But they are getting lots of support from important bloggers.  I know they were funded by Y Combinator and spent the summer in Boston. <p>I believe launching a product is as important (if not more important) than the idea, and getting it developed.  These guys have had a great launch.  I want to learn from them.<p>
Here are my questions:<p>Q1: Knowing there is many competition out there (but not exactly any clear leaders!) what made them interesting to Y Combinator, why were they chosen?<p>
Q2: Why so much hype and support (and so many positive reviews all over the place)? is it because of Y Combinator connections and support or there is more to it?<p>Q3: How big is this market and the potential of this business (if things workout for them) that got YC to invest? 
 <p>Note: I am not arguing whether they deserve it or not, and I am not questioning their product (but you could!) I just don't think they have revolutionized, there is many competition and they get the most attention, and I believe this kind of support could make or break a product.  <p>Few similar products: SezWho, Intense Debate, Tangler, JS-Kit, CoComment ...",1194552329

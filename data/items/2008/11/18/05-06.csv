367914,comment,367554,367554,0,0,neilk,,,"To respond to your other concerns:<p>Are you sure you're doing it right? Maybe your design is too abstract. Beginners to OO often overdo generality and they especially overdo inheritance. If your only goal is to handle a few operations with one particular filesystem, there is no shame in writing well-commented procedural code.<p>OO is not in itself a way of solving problems. It's supposed to model your problem so you can change different parts independently. So, for instance, in code modelling a filesystem, you can have code that performs a 'read()' and gets data but doesn't have to know where the blocks are or if it's talking to a pipe or an inode.<p>I struggled with understanding OO for a long time too. In retrospect, one of my biggest problems was that I simply hadn't worked on systems that were large enough. I could fit all my programs in my head. When you can't fit the whole program in your head, you need strategies for knowing (not just guessing) exactly how many things your code will affect. So the idea of an object as a sort of contract emerges. You want a read() of 12 bytes from an inode to work just the same as a read() from a pipe. So you devise a sort of 'contract' that the general class of ""FilePointer"" has to adhere to, and then you try to fulfill that in InodeFilePointer and PipeFilePointer. Make sense?<p>Where OO really takes off is in collaborating with other programmers.<p>Some languages are so in love with OO, they decree that everything is an object. This can be annoying, but it's also helpful in the long run. If you're strict about it, it's impossible to write code with weird side effects or that relies on mysterious globals to communicate information. Because all state changes are captured in the object, and the object also carries around a notion of how to modify itself, you can write a new kind of object and be very sure it will Just Work.<p>Once we have divided responsibilities this way it becomes possible to change our models in one part of the code without changing them in other parts. (In procedural code we might have to change the function signatures of just about every procedure in the codebase.) It's even possible to add in 'Mock' objects that just test the behaviour of other objects.",1226987760

As our program begins to process different types of data, we begin to see that some data always goes together and tends to hit certain branches of code together. This is because the code and the data together form an implicit model of how a particular kind of data should be handled.<p>Object orientation makes this explicit. We can store a little namespace of data in an object, and also give it a way to find the right code to run when it receives a 'message'. Then we can start to think of our program as a cascade of 'messages' between objects.",1226987048

367869,comment,367554,367554,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"Object oriented programming is definitely the way to go.  OOP came about as a series of incremental improvements made to procedural programming.<p>First came the idea of segmenting functionality into more manageable 'building blocks' called modules that worked together to provide the functionality of the entire system.<p>Next came abstract data types which incorporated the idea of treating a set of data and the logical operations on that data as a single unit.  Different ADTs were naturally stored in separate program modules.<p>Next came the idea of information hiding, or separating out a module's interface from its internal structure.  Information hiding serves two major purposes: a) allowing a module implementer greater freedom in changing how a module works without distrubing clients of the module and b) making it so a user does not have to understand everything about a module in order to use any part of the module.<p>Having figured out modularity, abstract data types, and information hiding, programmers then turned to the task of how to better reuse code.  Structured programming reduced the amount of duplicate code in a system, but still had quite a bit of code with only slight differences.  Inheritance was developed as a mechanism to deal with this problem.  Basically ADTs, now called classes, were arranged in a tree structure with the most general classes at the top and the most specific classes at the bottom.  Several additional mechanisms were added to the system that allow child classes to have access to their parent class definitions and for runtime polymorphism.<p>More than 64 words, I know.  However, because seeing how OOP evolved out of the solutions to procedural programming problems helped me to understand it and see its value, it seemed like it may help you as well.",1226984996

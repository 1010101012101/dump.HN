That kind of ruined it for me... and they kept asking for donations afterwards. Once these groups become self-prepetuating institutions it's time to find something else. It's easier just to incorporate meditation into daily life and activities.",1277823511
1471596,comment,1471463,1471463,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"Im all for heresy, even though i don't agree with the author, his heresy is useful, we must avoid programming religions. It at least helped me understand a cultural problem programmers have at the moment with FP. The downfall of OOP was that it was misunderstood by all the imperative programmers. Even though it was adopted, it was misused. The downfall of FP will be that it is misunderstood by all the oo programmers, if it gets adopted it will get misused.<p>I never found FP hard to learn or use. I know now that it was because when i got introduced to it, i only had about a year of imperative programming experience and no OO experience at all. I was a rather fresh mind. My advice to all OO programmers willing to learn FP is to approach it with a fresh mind, it may save you a lot of headaches. Imagine you know nothing about programming, you may be surprised how close to the truth that is for some of us(including me).",1277823463

It's much, much easier to develop in a system where you can treat calling most of the methods on most objects as if they were stateless.  A system that uses less state is more flexible and easily changed.  A system that better encapsulates state is also more flexible and easily changed.",1277823423

1471585,comment,1471204,1471204,0,0,rit,,,"Lately, the majority of my experience with LinkedIn has been endless recruiter spam (They wardial all the tech people at my office by looking at who is listed as a ""Developer"" at my company, or just keep sending me email spam offering crappy job prospects) or discovering former coworkers who want recommendations.  Looking at said coworkers often yields them taking credit for projects they didn't do or work on.  It's like exposing the resume lies in an entirely new, social network-ey way!<p>Of course, LinkedIn is making huge contributions in the technology space - they are the minds behind Project Voldemort - one of the burgeoning Dynamo+Bigtable NoSQL hybrids.  They're also a big user of the Hadoop stack and much of their tech team has written some great articles about their use of it over the last year or so.<p>Compared with MySpace, with which Mr. Hacker tries to inexplicably link LinkedIn (For doing ""nothing"" over 2 years), this alone is a huge boon to the community as  a whole.  MySpace was a SQL Server + ASP.net shop and as far as I know did nothing useful for the tech community except make us run away screaming in fear from the horror Murdoch hath wrought.<p>What exactly does a site like LinkedIn have to do at this point however?  They're still technically relevant - I don't cringe and laugh at the mention of it like I would say, MySpace.  It has proven for many people I know in recent months to be a boon.  At the very least I get a weekly email with updates of people in my network.  It's sometimes incredibly useful to know where people have moved to jobwise, etc.  Or if somebody really, really good is now on the beach and just hasn't called you yet - it gives you a chance to grab them before someone else does.<p>Also - WTF is with the site layout?  It looks like it's 800x600 fixed, with about  a 200 pixel gutter for the content.  It looks smushed in like crazy on my screen.",1277823239

I hardly ever even bother to check my FB profile anymore. If I want to get in contact with a friend, I text or call them on the phone. If I wish to maintain a business contact, LinkedIn is the way to go. At one time MySpace seemed like a good purchase for $580 million. In a bubble economy, things look best right at the peak. I don't know if Facebook has peaked, but if they continue to become ever-more spam infested and continue to annoy and frustrate users over privacy, I can see someone beating them at their own game.",1277823145

I especially like the contributor's functionality where you can send out the mockups for feedback.

Don't require any hrs, in fact let him know that if he can meet the deadline with 30 minutes of work per week then he earns himself a vacation for the rest of the time. However make sure his estimates are reasonable. Basically become a ""slave driver"". Note: DO NOT MICROMANAGE.

1471520,comment,1471271,1471271,0,0,brk,,,"There is no universal answer, and I think the criteria change somewhat on where you are in your life and your current and short-term expected income brackets.<p>Generally speaking, a car is never an investment.  It's a rapidly depreciating utility assest.  However, for some of us a car is also an entertainment item, and we get a large amount of pleasure from owning and driving a vehicle that makes the drive fun.<p>Some of my rules of thumb (and these sort of have to be adjusted for your location, and inflation over time).<p>A ""basic"" salary, meaning you can eek out a not-intolerable living, is equal to 1x your current age.  At this income level you can mostly survive without a lot of frills.<p>A ""good"" salary is 2x your income level.  Here you can often look at buying a modest house and maybe a new or 1 year old reliable middle-class car.  At much less than this amount it is probably unwise for you to take on any significant debt.<p>A salary of 3x your age will generally put you into the upper 5-10% income bracket, and if you manage your funds with a little bit of logic you should be able to make significant contributions to a retirement fund, a savings slush fund, own a decent house and have a luxury(ish) type of car.<p>For most of us in tech jobs, making a salary of 3x your age isn't difficult or unheard of at all.<p>If you're going to carry a traditional mortgage, you can probably afford a house that is about 5x your current income level.  This is one place, IMO, where if you have a semi-predictable career growth potential you can go to 8x, especially if you're younger and expect your income increases to significantly outpace inflation for the next few years (again, not uncommon in the early stages of a tech career).<p>If you plan to keep your car for 5-6 years, then .6x-1x your income is usually manageable in terms of a vehicle purchase price, scaling towards the higher end as your salary increases.<p>As an example:<p>25 years old, make 50K.  That would be about 30K after taxes, or $2500/mo.  A .7x car would be a 35000 vehicle.  0 down financing would be 686/mo over 5 years with an average interest rate.  A 5x house would be $250,000 (yes, not a lot in some places), which on a 30 year loan with 20% down and taxes/etc. rolled in to the monthly payment puts you right around $1100/mo.  So your car and home eat up 1800 of your 2500/mo.  Another 250 for utilities and 300 for food, and you're bumping up at about 2350/mo.  The other 150 would be for a small amount of savings and incidentals.  It's obviously very tight, but the idea is that your salary is also going to be increasing over short time while your major expenses (car, home) stay mostly fixed.  Buying a cheaper vehicle (a .6x or $30000 car)(or financing a lesser amount) would be a wise thing to do at that stage if you weren't confident about future job opportunities.<p>Again, these rules of thumb might not work in San Francisco, or if your career is going to be in the dog grooming industry.  But for most non-outrageous cost of living places for someone who has good career potential it is, IME, a good beginning estimation point.",1277822140

No, don't acknowledge it.  Sure, there are hardened synapses, but to a large extent that's just an excuse for people to feel sorry for themselves. O_O<p>So basically, just get over the fact that you think your brain's not an sharp as it was.  It's a load of crap.  It's still all there, and you need to just overcome to emotional inhibitions that are getting in the way of you using it.<p>University is a pretty safe environment for exploring --as it should be; that's its purpose if nothing else.  As a result, you're pretty well emotionally oblivious to the ""what-if fears"" of putting everything --all your mind and all your passion- into what you do.  Perfect.<p>When you depart, a profoundly unseen transition takes place; you don't have that environment anymore.  So you continue with the momentum you had for a while --couple months, 10 years- and then it's gone.  You're learned a new environment that pulls into your mind before everything else a whole mess of things; the clichés of ""only what's good enough"" and ""dreams are just dreams.""<p>And then there's the ""age 27 factor"" as I've coined from the film Proof.

Honestly, for myself, I'm typically looking back over old stuff and, while realizing the significant merit they held at the time and to the process of moving to where I am now, they're working in a highly limited fashion.  What consistently happens is I let their singular weight become a symbol, a pristine concept for the knowledge I gained and I hold them so much more highly that what they actually are.  On a personal level, that's fine.  But to compare that symbol to actual work, no.  Don't do it.<p>So here's my final thoughts on what it boils down to: 
    Get over it.  Your brain is still all there unless you've found little bits on your pillow.
    It's only a simple emotional inhibition that's preventing you from actually using your brain.  Don't blame it on <i>anything</i> else.

But it does feel like you may be leaving money on the table.<p>You (should) know your market better than anyone else, but be careful on competing with price.  Competing with price is sometimes a crutch for actual marketing and a wishful shortcut in demonstration of value.  Because, as mostly hackers, generally speaking we aren't great at marketing. And so, subconciously IMO what happens is we think ""i'll let someone else market the idea with their higher price product, and then i'll swoop in with the cheaper offering"".<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't work out that storybook.  Markets aren't that transparent, and there is always an asymmetry in information.  You're going to have to demonstrate real value and claw your way into relevance.  So initially you will have to do a lot of ""hand-to-hand combat"" style marketing. And find key differentiators you can lead with that isn't price.<p>How about pricing it at $49 and then running a promo for initial new users?  First 100 customers get it at $19?<p>As an aside, I spent $79 on Balsamiq last year.  I think that is the most I've spent on software in the last two years (I stick with mostly open source / freeware).

Use game mechanics to get employees to contribute, and also game mechanics to get employers to implement the advice given by the system.<p>- Make a game distribution platform that takes a lot less money from the developers (last time I checked the margins were around 30%). They would hopefully all fly there.<p>- Location-aware shopping site. Many people around here regularly check nearby small clothing stores for fresh stuff. The app would be a minimalist display of the latest arrivals in their neighborhoods (google maps integration etc etc).",1277820099

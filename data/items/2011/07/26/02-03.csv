Near intersections, you have to move into the lane or people will cut you off and turn right in front of you when you're going straight. If the road has no shoulder, you have to move into the lane to dissuade people from running you off the road by trying to pass with insufficient space (and to give yourself some margin in case someone tries).

But since atoms don't have unique IDs, it's no problem to have two (almost) identical people beside each other.<p>Also, contrary to popular fiction, the past isn't changed only because a blundering human is transported into it, it is <i>already</i> altered by the mere introduction of additional matter into a system that would have evolved differently without it. So, if you want to change the past, transport a single proton back 2 million years into some swamp. Of course, that would be pointless because nobody would ever know what changed...<p>The real conundrum is what actually happens to the ""old"" universe at the instant of traveling back into the past. Is everything that happened between those two points in time erased? Or does the old universe continue as if nothing happened and a new parallel one branches out that is of no consequence at all? In the infinite universes theory, time travel would merely amount to ""jumping"" into the ""right"" neighboring universe (however, personally this whole business with infinite branching parallel universes always seemed like a wasteful and inelegant model to me).<p>All these theories have one thing in common though: things change only for the time travelers themselves. So for meaningful time travel, you would have to be able to transport whole beings across a doorway in spacetime. Twice. In the right direction. Given the known conditions near theoretically surmised holes in spacetime, that's not an easy task. Atoms: maybe. Huge fragile collections of unstable molecules: probably not.",1311648668

This produces a lot of communication problems so I think the forum doesn't fit to do this task. Some examples:<p>- It's pretty hard to measure things about the project.<p>- Sharing private information.<p>- Pending requests for information, confirmation...<p>- If an investor is interested in a project he has to post in a ""project investors list thread"". This always causes at least two problems: an investor forgets to add the previous entered on the list and someone has to fix it, some investors don't want to appear in the list, so they send a private message to the project manager, and then the project manager has to update the list.<p>So I'm thinking about building an app to solve this problem and I'd like to know if there are already similar apps in the market.

An image is just a function of amplitude vs. distance, though there are 2 distance variables since an image is 2-dimensional, but the idea is the same, and the Fourier Transform is still defined for functions of 2 or more variables.

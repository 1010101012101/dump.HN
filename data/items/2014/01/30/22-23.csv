They seem to be somewhere between the ExtJS/AngularJS spectrum.<p>I&#x27;ve used Sencha&#x27;s frameworks on 3 different projects now, and I still hate it. For many different reasons:<p>1. The learning curve: This is probably something you already know. But you may not be aware of is the other effects this can cause. If your team consists of members of different level of experience (from 0+), the code quality is going to suffer a lot from the lack of knowledge.<p>2. ExtJS and Sencha Touch are 2 different products. Today&#x27;s web app demands to be runnable on many different platforms. With ExtJS you get point and click. With Sencha Touch you get swipe and pinch. But what if you&#x27;re running it on a touch laptop that needs both point and click and swipe and pinch? I&#x27;m working on a product right now that integrated the 2. While we succeeded at reaching the goal, the result is not something I&#x27;m proud of.<p>3. Sencha is a walled garden that makes it hard to integrate other libraries into it. For the most part, Sencha already have a lot of things that you needed (like data grid, combo box, etc). But what if you want to do complex data visualization with d3? Complex interactive behavior with Rxjs? Or realtime updates with socket.io?<p>Eventually, I found out that no matter which framework you choose to use, you&#x27;ll end up needing to read its source code to understand what&#x27;s underneath. If you have to do so anyway, why not pick a framework that&#x27;s simple to understand?",1391121026

That&#x27;s not value, in fact, it&#x27;s negative value in my mind.<p>If I want to manipulate the DOM or do AJAX I&#x27;ll use JQuery, if I want to do data binding I&#x27;ll use knockout.js, etc.<p>But these are minor annoyances compared to the huge ExtJS no-no for me which is the fact that ExtJS seem to actually <i>hate</i> Javascript.

7153708,comment,7150360,7151206,0,0,tzs,,,"(Pasted from an earlier discussion)<p>That&#x27;s not correct. What it actually does is reserve some markup for use by third parties that have reverse engineered various old programs (including programs that competed with Microsoft programs), so that if those people have workflows that depend on features of those old programs that cannot be represented in OOXML, they can still use OOXML as a storage format but add in the extra information they need.<p>Here&#x27;s the use case this is aimed at. Suppose I run, say, a law office, and we&#x27;ve got an internal document management system that does things like index and cross reference documents, manage citation lists, and stuff like that. The workflow is based on WordPerfect format (WordPerfect was for a long time the de facto standard for lawyers).<p>Now suppose I want to start moving to a newer format for storage. Say I pick ODF, and start using that for new documents, and make my tools understand it. I&#x27;d like to convert my existing WordPerfect documents to ODF. However, there are things in WordPerfect that cannot be reproduced exactly in ODF, and this is a problem. If my tools need to figure out what page something is on, in order to generate a proper citation to that thing, and I&#x27;ve lost some formatting information converting to ODF, I may not get the right cite.<p>So what am I going to do? I&#x27;m going to add some extra, proprietary markup of my own to ODF that lets me include my reverse engineered WordPerfect knowledge when I convert my old documents to ODF, and my new tools will be modified to understand this. Now my ODF workflow can generate correct cites for old documents. Note that LibreOffice won&#x27;t understand my additional markup, and will presumably lose it if I edit a document, but that&#x27;s OK. The old documents I converted should be read-only.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m not the only person doing this. Suppose you also run a law office, with a WordPerfect work flow, and are converting to an ODF work flow. You are likely going to add some proprietary markup, just like I did. We&#x27;ll both end up embedding the same WordPerfect information in our converted legacy documents, but we&#x27;ll probably pick different markup for it. It would be nice if we could get together, make a list of things we&#x27;ve reverse engineered, and agree to use the same markup when embedding that stuff in ODF.<p>And that&#x27;s essentially what they did in OOXML. They realized there would be people like us with our law offices, who have reverse engineered legacy data, that will be extending the markup. So they made a list of a bunch of things from assorted past proprietary programs that were likely to have been reverse engineered by various third parties, and reserved some markup for each.",1391120079

They then take turns typing in code, and discuss what they are doing as they go.  Kind of like working out a complex math problem on the chalkboard in school.<p>The benefits are: 1) transfer of knowledge -- you have at least one other person that knows the thought process behind the code; 2) cleaner code -- when paired up, you are in a semi-teaching mode, so you are more likely to use clean and understandable code.  That is, if it is too hard to explain it, and you are required to explain it to the point of understanding, then you will have a tendency to not be as obscure.<p>The main drawbacks: Often times, when something is sufficiently complex, you really need to concentrate for hours to develop a solution.  And having someone (either more junior, or more senior) throwing out random suggestions, when they have no clue what data structures you have built up in your head, is somewhat counter-productive.  Another major drawback -- too much transfer of germs.  You need to make sure each person has their own keyboard/mouse, and preferably some extra space between them (such as pair programming using remote displays, and not being right on top of each other).<p>Disclaimer -- I haven&#x27;t worked in a full-time developer role in any shop that uses pair programming extensively, although I have paired up with other developers from time to time to help them through some C code that they didn&#x27;t understand.",1391120003

The reactor design itself was fine, and in fact has withstood loss of coolant conditions that, by any reasonable prior expectation, should have caused much <i>more</i> radiation release than they did.<p>Chernobyl, on the other hand, had:<p>* No secondary containment;<p>* A Soviet-run staff that thought running badly controlled experiments at high power levels was just dandy;<p>* A graphite moderator that ignited when exposed to air.<p>Fukushima is not even in the same league from that perspective.<p><i>That type of nuclear power generation really is that terrible.</i><p>This is a serious overstatement. Many reactors designed along the same general lines have delivered decades of power with no problems. (Not to mention that the US Navy has run reactors of similar design on its ships for decades with no problems.) I&#x27;m all for improving reactor designs, but I also think there are existing designs that could have gotten plenty more use without significant added risk.

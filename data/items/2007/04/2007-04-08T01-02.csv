Microsoft is not dead, because (come on get real) it's a company, and companies aren't living, and they don't die ...'</i> [0]<p>It's always good to read a collory argument. In this case Dave Winer.  <p>Can't help think that Dave misses the point. MS is dead in the sense they are no longer the dominant force in software technology. Especially true in the eyes of the young consumer. Remember when MS was a consumer OS company instead of just another supplier to (Big) Business.<p>I do like the idea of cycle of tech companies and appeals to the empiricist in me. <p>Reference<p>[0]  The Corporation, a film by Mark Achbar, Jennifer Abbot, Joel Baken, 2003, ""<i>'...  Corporation lawyers gained rights through the US Supreme Court using the 14th Amendment (set up to protect slaves) that gives them the rights of a person ...'</i>  As  for corporations not living, they do have the the rights of a living person, distastefully  garnered from rights assigned to liberate slaves.

My name was eventually brought up and I got a phone call later that night to go over the idea. A week later I had a prototype version ready to demonstrate and we moved on from there. That was 5 years ago and we're still business partners to this day.",1175996686

Thank You!<p>What some of the (ok, us) ""older"" folks don't realize is that the younger generation will bring their technology to work with them and it will eat away at the corporate desktop from within despite all the ""we need a big vendor to cover our asses when the Fed regulators come a knockin'"" attitudes that prevail in that world. And IBM is still there to beat them down from above.

On my machine PC/Firefox the font is considerably smaller. Just checked: The anti aliased Mac version is still obviously smaller. The indent also helps. I guess if it were too small it becomes difficult to read. But again, this is a matter of taste (among specialists) and not so much an objective design flaw. This site is 100 times superior in terms of design to anything I have seen in the last couple of weeks.<p>3. As far as I can see this line announces the update, thus a harsh break. That's why it's so loud. I have no problem with that either.<p>To say that the form contradicts the message is WAY out of line.<p>Just checked your website www.gibson-design.com.

I would not remove a feature just because the competition also has the feature. I would remove it if the feature isn't critical to the central idea, the main motivation behind the product. So in that sense, the competition is irrelevant in this discussion as long as your central idea is reasonably unique.",1175994498

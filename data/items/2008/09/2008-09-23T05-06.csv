There are a number of countries with high penetrations that are not listed - Japan and Australia just to name two.<p>Taken from the Nielson site:
<i>Nielsen currently tracks mobile Internet penetration in 16 
countries. Among these countries, the US leads in mobile 
Internet penetration among wireless subscribers...</i>

The jobs I'm considering most seriously after graduation are technical program manager positions at Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and other large tech firms.<p>Although macroeconomics is one of my weak subjects, the current economic situation has got me questioning whether I would be better off in terms of prosperity and job stability if I looked to start a career in Canada instead. What do you think?",1222149267

312117,comment,311146,311842,0,0,anamax,,,"Looking above, we see that you admitted that your question was answered.  Lisp ""executables"" typically require run-times, just like ""executables"" in many other languages.<p>However, now the goal posts are moving.<p>The original question was how to deploy a lisp program.  That typically requires the relevant run times, just as it does in every other language that uses dynamic linking and/or interpretation.  (Emacs is not required to run lisp.  Heck, it isn't even required to write it.  Likewise, slime is a development convenience.  If it's too much trouble, don't bother.)<p>I mentioned other languages to demonstrate that the problem is not lisp-specific.<p>To write a program in any language, someone has to install a compiler or interpreter and their dependencies.  Folks who can't/won't do that themselves are stuck with whatever came with their system.<p>Again, this is not lisp-specific.<p>It would be nice if a reasonable lisp came pre-installed as part of linux distributions.  But, like lots of other languages, it doesn't.<p>If you can't or won't install runtimes, there are lots of things that you can't deploy.  (That's why I asked about an installation system to help automate this work.)  If you can't or won't install a compiler and/or interpreter, there are lots of languages that you can't write.",1222148203

1) get rid of the front page dominating ""welcome"", I think it's unnecessary and annoying - people will click on the link and read more if they want to.<p>2) make the interface <i>exactly</i> like hacker news. For instance I think the bold titles is a bit distracting, esp after navigating over from hn.<p>3) one of my favorite features of hn is that I can often just type ""n"" into my browser address bar and the browser autocompletes to news.ycombinator.com.  This is particularly useful on my mobile.  Would be cool if the name of non-hn had some similar sort of name that leveraged autocomplete.",1222147252

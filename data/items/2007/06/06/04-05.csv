Registered ""Ransomware.com"" just for the purpose (and still hang onto the domain, because one day I might come back to it).  This was about the same time I started in on what is my current business, so it took a backseat.<p>Anyway, I think it's a solid idea--but the competition is stiff.  SourceForge.net takes donations on behalf of its projects, every Open Source project has a PayPal link, Elance/rent-a-coder eats up the very specific work where only one person/company wants it, SitePoint runs ""contests"" sponsored by big companies.  And, of course, your profit comes from taking a small cut, so you have to do a very high volume--hundreds or thousands of projects per day, if you want reasonable revenues for just a couple of employees.  If it's a one-man shop, it's a solid business.  By the time you take investment, or hire some additional employees, it could get ugly.",1181103257

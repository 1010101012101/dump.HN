Throttle login attempts by requiring a cryptographic proof-of-work to accompany each attempt.  Send the credentials and proof-of-work over UDP so that there's no connection state to hold open.  Scale the required amount of work up and down based on the total number of incorrect attempts in the past minute.  After a successful login, issue systems a long-lived cookie that exempts them from future proof-of-work requirements.  That way, during attacks, legitimate users may experience a longer delay when trying to log in, but only if they've never logged in from that system before, and they can never be locked out completely.",1289318308

Traveling around with just one suitcase of clothes and my laptop opened my eyes: Of all the stuff I own, everything I really needed for my every day life was right there with me. And it is so easily replaceable...<p>I never was a big gatherer, but since then I really cut down on buying things. In addition to that I'm getting rid of my things, some are easier to lose some are harder to give away or sell, but in the end it feels great. I actually find it liberating to stand in a store and _not_ buy the fancy item which would inevitably be degraded to be clutter on the shelf in a few weeks. The money I spend goes into the few things I really use all the time, like my iPhone. I also eat better. All in all I'd say it made me a happier person.",1289318265

When I sit down at a system, I load the key into the agent and then unmount the usb drive. It seems that the only way the private key could be compromised is if someone breaks into the agent when I'm on the machine or if someone spoofs the connection to the agent (which, if I understand correctly, won't give them the key, only the ability to use the key while the agent is running).<p>If the usb drive is lost/stolen, there should be no information that reveals which systems it works on. The key also has a very long passphrase, since I only type it once per day, so that should at least make brute force attacks against the key difficult.<p>This seems like a pretty secure solution to me.

It's true, a large pool of dedicated memcache machines can be quite expensive.  However, the given technology only works when the database fits in memory.

Force all keys to be controlled by root and in a central location. 

  b. Implement kerberos so that users don't need to use keys for single sign-on.

  c. only allow keys for functional ids (i.e. mysql), use IP filtering (from=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) on the public key to limit key access to a few administrative servers. 

  d. If NFS homedirs are exported to the world, any attacker can mount them and read off the keys from .ssh directories.

What is the Cookie Diet? How does it work?<p>Answer from Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D.: ""The original Cookie Diet was created in 1975 by Dr. Sanford Siegal to help his overweight patients lose weight. The Cookie Diet limits calories to no more than 1,000 a day, which come from six prepackaged cookies plus one meal, such as skinless chicken and steamed vegetables. The cookies are made and sold by Dr. Siegal's company and are said to contain a proprietary amino acid mixture that fights hunger.<p>If followed, a diet of less than 1,000 calories a day will likely lead to weight loss. But such a restricted diet can make it hard to meet all of your nutritional needs. In addition, it's difficult to stick with extreme diets such as the Cookie Diet. As a result, any lost pounds come right back once the diet stops.<p>The bottom line: To achieve and maintain a healthy weight, you need to make permanent and sustainable changes in your eating and exercise habits.""",1289316895

There are many practices below Agile such as Scrum, XP, Lean, Kanban, DSDM, FDD, etc.<p>Agile itself is just a set of principles. The actual implementation still require some processes.<p>I don't think people should attack Agile as a whole, but they should focus on which practices they chose. For example: Scrum is an agile practice for Project Management. But in order for a shop to use Scrum, they must implement certain practices from XP. XP more of an agile practice for Software Developers.<p>There are shops which implement only SCRUM but not the XP part. That is to say that they implement the whole Sprint, Retrospectives, Backlog, Stand-up meeting, but they did not refactor bad code, they did not try their best to have an automation in place. At the end of each sprint, they never test the whole app, they only test whatever the sprint accomplished. This is even worse than the previous practice.<p>I wholeheartedly agree with those who have been burned by management who thinks that SCRUM or XP will make things better in a short time. I hate to say this but it takes a very long time for a company to change their culture and mindset (depending on the size of the company and what the company does: product vs service).<p>If your company is switching to something new, make sure they know that methodology inside out. Make sure they met the pre-requisite. Make sure they are willing to sacrifice their time and money for a while.<p>Otherwise, get your resume ready cause the ship will sink faster than before.<p>On the other hand, some people might not agree with this but when you have one of these processes in place and everything in your engineering department runs well, that doesn't mean life is good. When the company is not doing well, your senior engineers who receive a big-fat check every month might be a good candidate to be let go. The reason is because your intermediate and junior engineers have already known everything inside out (cause one of the practice in Agile is to share knowledge, cross-functional team, or whatever).<p>Be aware that it could be a double-edged sword.",1289316761

What follows in an excerpt from a blog posting I made back in 2004 (the blog itself kind of went off on a tangent and then died of neglect when shortly afterward due to my Parkinsonism and a series of small strokes, so it's probably best left unlinked). I was a well-known developer on the Lotus Domino platform at the time...<p>""What seems like forever ago, I made the mistake of mentioning in one or the other of the developerWorks forums that I had a way to create a pretty-looking categorized calendar on the web. I say 'mistake' because the requests for the code have reached the level that they actually swamp out the spam in my inbox (proving once and for all that Domino, at least, is not dead yet). I've sent out demo databases in response, and they have helped a few people. Many, many more people have just turned around and outright demanded that I do the work it would take to integrate the calendar into their applications. For free, mind you.<p>""When did that kind of behaviour become acceptable? I really hate to unfairly categorize these requests, but the vast majority have come from the same people and organisations that are trying to put me out of work by claiming to be able to do my job for less money. (I should point out here that I make a whole lot less than most Americans and Europeans in the Notes development game would make as the consequences of being Canadian, of how I got this job, and of the vagaries of corporate M&A.) Now, I've been beyond broke, and I can understand beggars, but I never imagined that I would regularly encounter the equivalent of streetcorner beggars who are fully employed and ask not for spare change, but for passers-by to go to the office and do their work for them, gratis, so that they can collect their salaries.<p>""I'm quite well aware that there are a lot (and I do mean a lot) more people working in places like Bangalore and Mumbai than have ever requested code from me, but there still seems to be a disproportionate number of people from the major outsourcing centres who feel entitled to demand that I do their work for them. I'm not talking about 'borrowing' code here — anyone who has embarked on a developer's career without peeking at other people's code can probably be fairly classified as an idiot. Nor am I talking about people who are merely trying to learn the sort of stuff you don't get in the 'Introduction to Domino Designer' course; I generally have a high tolerance for newbies who actually seem to want to learn. I did, after all, offer the code base, and I have no problem working with people who have made an effort to understand what I've done and may have a lingering question or two. I'm just wondering what kind of cultural climate would persuade anyone, anywhere, to believe that it's perfectly okay to demand that I (or anyone else, for that matter) do work for free so that they can be paid for 'work' they got by undercutting my wages.""",1289315549

These folks (i was one of them too) never really have a chance to think and do stuff on their own till this project, and then all of a sudden you are required to do something interesting all by yourself to secure a degree. Most of them end up doing really horrible projects (but no one really cares about them actually, so they do get a degree after all).<p>For some, this is when things start to turn around for good :)",1289315211

Gladly! I love writing documentation.<p>However, I'm not a fan of the big three blog/CMS systems: Wordpress, Joomla, or Drupal, so I'm building my own. It's called Sankla and I'm marketing it like I would a paid product. If you're interested in being notified when I release the beta, feel free to register on http://sankla.org.<p>Why am I building my own? Several reasons:<p><pre><code>  * I enjoy writing open source software
  * I have a bit of NIH syndrome
  * I want to build lightweight and secure blog software
  * I want to build a flexible content management system/web builder
</code></pre>
I know, it's a lofty goal to go after software that corners a huge chunk of the market, but I think it's possible and I always enjoy a good challenge.<p>I'm asking if this is something you'd be interested in and if so, what features you'd like to see? So far, the biggest I've seen are a nice API and Markdown support. Sankla has both built in. I'm also doing my best to pay attention to common security vulnerabilities, such as using prepared queries, stopping CSRF attacks, preventing XSS, and man in the middle attacks.<p>Again, if you'd be interested in something like that, please register on the website and I'll notify you when the beta is launched.<p>Thank you for everything, HN.<p>http://sankla.org",1289315101

It seems I hit a common nerve.  Amongst the many comments on that post, people suggested various ways of tracking the progress of their projects and keeping in touch with each another (spreadsheets, google docs, facebook groups, etc).  I was personally not planning on anything other than an announcement on HN when I had completed my project, but by the end of that day it was clear there was something bigger going on, and that more would be needed to help track it.<p>So I started to think about what was /really/ going on.  It seems that we all feel drawn to be our better selves when we have a common goal, even though we may be achieving it in different ways.  What was needed was a site that could help people be accountable for their goal, and draw them together to finish them.<p>Thus, StartupMonth.org.<p>At this point though, it was still a pipe dream.  I have my own full-time consulting gig, a new full-time job to transition into, a part-time startup, AND side projects that need to be completed (the entire goal for November for me is to finally finish as many of the side projects as possible).   I had vague intentions of building a site for this, and even bought the domain startupmonth.org, but was not sure when I would be able to fit it in.<p>Thankfully, Jon Gilbraith (hn: inm) stepped up and volunteered to help develop the site, and Jake Stutzman of http://www.elevatevc.com volunteered to do the design.  So, for the last 30 days, we've been building and designing the site in the very little bits of spare time we had, and today we'd like to show it to you. We were hoping to get this out before November 1st, but had too many things on our collective plates to be able to get it done.<p>Now that 30 days has passed, there is still plenty of work to do to the site, but in the spirit of StartupMonth we are launching anyways, and will tweak and fix the site as it is used.  Shipping is a feature!  So, <i></i>please<i></i> let us know your thoughts on the site,  either here or as comments on http://startupmonth.org/apps/startupmonthorg.  We're aware that there are some missing features but everything we need to showcase, post news on and discuss our apps is there.<p>Also, need to mention the awesome site that the 21times guys have done that can also help with getting your startups off the ground:  http://hn.21times.org   Ryan reached out to me via email when they were finishing it up - My apologies Ryan for not getting back to you.   Would love to chat on how we could integrate and make these complimentary sites.<p>Cheers!",1289315060

Get a WordPress.com/Tumblr/Posterous blog, learn little by little, try out some CSS/HTML, then get your own hosting when you can, branch out, and eventually you never know where it might go.  It might go good, you might love it and learn a lot, but it could fail ... you'll never know if you don't try.  And if trying doesn't cost anything, why not?

1886610,comment,1886310,1886513,0,0,aniket_ray,,,"I think a lot of what you say is the correct. I'll just add to that.<p>Most of these ""polite Indians"" are college students from not-so good colleges (or bad students at good colleges). They are studying Engineering just because of parental/peer pressure. I'm sure every Indian would know more than 3-4 friends who are studying just to make somebody else proud.<p>Each semester, these students have some courses with assignments. The first thing they do is ""Google"" the assignment. If they don't find the solutions on the front page of Google, they either raid forums (including comment sections of blogs) asking for help or else they contact a small coding shop and ""outsource"" their assignments. These coding shops are small shops that charge extremely low rates too, so they don't have the best programmers either. Quite often coding shop employees raid the web for help too. A friend of mine has actually hired 3-4 ""sub-standard"" coders proceeds of which he uses to bootstrap his main startup.<p>Unfortunately, in this storm sometimes even genuine students who just wish to learn get crowded out. My suggestion (and what I do generally) is to answer people as long as it is just about concepts. If you start doing somebody else's homework the whole batch might start asking you for help. So, my advice is just don't do anybody's homework.",1289314951

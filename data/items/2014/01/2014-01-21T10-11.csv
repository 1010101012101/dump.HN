7094508,comment,7093369,7094472,5,0,sounds,,,"The Bill of Rights ostensibly covers anyone under US jurisdiction, even a non-US citizen.<p>(The Bill of Rights is a specific set of rights enumerated to _limit_ the government, it is _not_ an enumeration of rights granted to a person. The Declaration of Independence and US Constitution are powers extended from the people to the government at the people&#x27;s pleasure.)<p>Having said that, I said &quot;ostensibly.&quot; I mean that US Code and jurisprudence are convoluted. Immigrants or tourists are especially at risk: deportation, or worse, a one way ticket to Guatanamo. This is absolutely in violation of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, but the US Government is currently trying to lie and deny and bluff its way around those founding documents.<p>In my opinion, the attack on immigrants/tourists/foreigners (hi, NSA) is an attempt to gain <i>prima facie</i> precedents that will then be extended to regular citizens. Case in point: wiretaps, drones, and US citizens held indefinitely without a trial. I am a US Citizen but I defend your rights because it&#x27;s only a matter of time before it will come back to me.",1390301825

7094496,comment,7093369,7094310,1,0,repsilat,,,"It&#x27;s easy enough to ground this in game theory to make the analogy more explicit.<p>Say there&#x27;s a street with two houses. In the event of a crime, people in the houses can volunteer information to the police. They don&#x27;t know ahead of time whether their information is pertinent to the investigation or self-incriminating. Crime goes down by half if one house regularly snitches, and crime is eliminated if both do.<p>The expected cost of self-incrimination when volunteering information (with all probabilities worked out) is 3. The cost of unchecked crime in the neighbourhood is 4, applied to each house. The payoffs, then:<p>- If neither house snitches, payoffs are -4/-4.<p>- If one house snitches, payoffs are -2/-5 (against the snitch)<p>- If both houses snitch, payoffs are -3/-3.<p>This is <i>classic</i> prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. I thought the general idea was clear enough in my initial post, but at this point the analogy I was making should be impossible to miss.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with your third paragraph.

If I manage to register mcdonalds.com, currently McDonald&#x27;s, the gigantic fast food company, can just take it.  Is that terrible?<p>Now, if I&#x27;ve been selling a product under the name &quot;iPhone&quot; for 13 years and I have to change the name because someone else in another country managed to release a competing product of the same name and become more famous than me... that&#x27;s pretty harsh.    Off the top of my head, two obvious approaches come to mind --<p>1. A &quot;use it or lose it&quot; regime, where the Brazilian guy with the iPhone trademark keeps it as long as he&#x27;s actually doing business under it (it could well be that you can&#x27;t maintain a trademark without using it anyway; I don&#x27;t know much about trademark law).<p>2. The Brazilian iPhone guy should have been <i>absurdly over-vigilant</i> about potentially infringing marks, just like we all complain about major companies doing.  He needed to keep Apple&#x27;s iPhone out of Brazil entirely (or force them to change its name in the Brazilian market).<p>Also, following your link, two things jump out at me:<p>- Though the trademark was first requested in 2000, and it says the companies have been fighting over it for 6 years, it also says the Brazilian &quot;iphone&quot; went on sale last year.  That looks a little more like bad faith.<p>- It looks like the judge didn&#x27;t take the trademark away -- he said they&#x27;d have to share (not great, but not as bad as suddenly losing the name of your product).",1390300879

7094421,comment,7093761,7094144,1,0,a-nikolaev,,,"Absolutely agree. OpenGL, SDL, Cairo, all are great and useful for their own purposes, with rather small overlap between then. A single uniform API for graphics is practically impossible, so why bother? To attract beginners?<p>Graphics has very limited usage without full GUI. I can think of only games and chart-rendering applications (or similar) that don&#x27;t really need GUI. But games require some means for windows-handling (like GLUT in OpenGL). And &quot;chart-rendering&quot; require output routines to produce PDF/PS/SVG/PNG.. In any case, you need quite a lot of auxiliary IO functions to really do anything useful. So, how much of thes auxiliary stuff will be included in the standard library?<p>Also, if they plan to implement output with both DirectX and OpenGL, there is quite a lot of work to ensure that everything works on computers with GPU, without GPU, with ancient GPU, on Windows, Linux, OSX and actually looks roughly the same. This is not easy, if you want to do it efficiently.<p>For game development, beginners choose Flash game engines, or GameMaker, or something like that. I doubt that C++ can work better for them, even with Cairo built in.<p>The standard library will always have limitations, so you will need to use external libraries at some point anyway. And a transition to an external library can be difficult, if the standard library is already used extensively.<p>Yes, probably, humongous standard library is good for cross-platform development, but it must be implemented first. And again, external libraries are sometimes necessary anyway. Also some UI libraries are already cross-platform, like Qt, btw.",1390300022
7094420,comment,7084845,7089603,2,0,merijnv,,,"Shipping non-open graphics drivers <i>together</i> with the linux kernel <i>is</i> a violation of the GPL. Providing non-open binaries <i>separately</i> from the linux kernel is not. The GPL only applies to distribution, if you&#x27;re not distributing GPL code (for instance, only your non-open drivers) there&#x27;s no problem.<p>The GPL puts no restrictions on use, i.e. once you&#x27;ve got both linux and your non-open drivers the GPL doesn&#x27;t care whether you combine the two.<p>Additionally, as people point out the license can only be enforced by copyright holders, so if no linux copyright owners bother to sue people distributing non-open drivers, nothing will happen.<p>This is however rather shaky legal ground, as at any point you <i>could</i> get sued for violating the license. This also why linux doesn&#x27;t ship ZFS, since the CDDL is incompatible with GPL any company distributing linux with ZFS would open itself to a potential lawsuit by any linux copyright holder. You can imagine most companies are not very happy taking this risk.<p>With regards to Richard Yao&#x27;s comments, of course he&#x27;s not worried. Copyright violation (which is what breaking the GPL is) only lets you sue for monetary damages or to stop the distribution. There&#x27;s zero reason for people to sue most linux distros as they&#x27;re non-profits that aren&#x27;t charging for distribution. Since it&#x27;s nearly impossible to show monetary loss by a linux copyright holder (it&#x27;s being distributed for free!) The only thing to possibly do would be to sue the distros into ceasing distribution, which seems an undesirable outcome for most linux copyright holders, so that&#x27;s unlikely to be enforced.<p>Since GPL doesn&#x27;t restrict actual usage the users of these distros have nothing to worry about anyway.<p>In summary, you only have to worry about being sued if you are <i>both</i> violating the GPL <i>and</i> making some sort of money while doing it. But the fact that you <i>probably</i> won&#x27;t get sued doesn&#x27;t mean that what you are doing is not illegal<i>.<p></i> - Well, in any country that&#x27;s signed the Berne Convention, anyway.",1390300004

And contrary to some more basic use cases, UI libraries tend to be, by necessity, absolutely enormous.<p>If the end result is going to be another poorly-designed library like many of the STLs modules, I&#x27;d <i>much</i> rather developers use the proper UI toolkit for the situation.",1390299250

If the information is generated by the user, it has the potential to be something easily guessed.<p>2. Something you have: SSH key, GPG key, RSA token, Yubikey, Google Authenticator. These can be quite secure, but hard to use. Losing a physical auth token deprives the user of access. SSH/GPG key pairs depend on the security of the system(s) they&#x27;re stored on.<p>3. Something you are: fingerprint, retina scan, face recognition, voiceprint. These are irrevocable and anathema to privacy. Worst of all, they&#x27;re not very reliable or secure. Fingerprint scanners are stymied if one has recently been lifting weights or rock climbing. Face recognition is affected by lighting, makeup, glasses, hair, sunburn/tan, age, etc. Voice auth is a joke.

I&#x27;ve seen some shocking ball-o-mud code bases, and the only way to make sense of it was to understand the author(s), though never having met them. And to understand the subtext of the syntax, despite inconsistent application (poor naming convention and mixing ladder and structured text is like reading illuminated medieval engravings). There&#x27;s code smells and slight variation in copy/paste blocks that belie the history of edits. There are threads woven through multiple volumes, where deprecated interlocks and crossed wires lead to bizarre plot twists. It&#x27;s easy to think of certain machines as having personalities (or mental disorders, as the case may be). And there&#x27;s never just an atomic dozen lines of code; at best you can reference five subroutines across two PLCs to describe what may be going on. And like good literature, you can&#x27;t spoil the ending, as the joy is in the retelling of the story (of how you tracked down what was <i>really</i> happening).<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be a fascinating travesty, but I&#x27;ve yet to see a boring, dull, straightforward control system.

1681179,comment,1680149,1681084,0,0,_delirium,,,"> Here's a challenge: I would really love to see someone write a full-featured web browser (at the level of a Firefox, Chrome or Safari) in Forth. You can do that in C, C++, Java, Python, and probably in dozens of other languages I could name. [...] I think that any web browser that anyone attempted to write in Forth (without local variables, naturally!) would never get finished.<p>Do those languages actually pass the test, though? I see the point, but I think this particular challenge problem is a bit too hard in terms of size of teams and resources needed--- hard enough that as a descriptive matter, Java, Python, and every other language that isn't C/C++ has actually failed the test. Many people have tried, and all of those browsers have, well, never gotten finished. People have been writing a pure-Java modern web browser since at least 1997, when Netscape decided to rewrite Navigator in Java (in a project, ""Javagator"", that was never finished). Along the way, there've been a half-dozen other half-finished Java browsers (HotJava, Lobo, etc.). There's a half-finished Common Lisp browser, too (Closure). But nothing outside of C/C++ competes with Webkit, Opera, IE, and Firefox.<p>I do agree that Forth isn't a great language for writing to complex predefined specifications. I like its general ideas, though, and the principle of deciding to solve a simpler problem rather than a harder one actually seems fine to me, if you really are in a position where you have the choice. Not that I'm big on Forth, personally, but it's somewhat philosophically consonant with my own preferences, which are in the suckless.org vein.",1284191821

1681174,comment,1680149,1680976,0,0,pauldirac137,,,"Factor has local variables (implemented as a library) so this problem doesn't really exist.  However, Factor programmers try to avoid using locals as much as possible, so in reality the problem does exist.  It's almost like some people have a religious aversion to locals.  Locals do make factoring harder, and perhaps Factor code can be optimized better without locals, but I think that not having bunches of swaps, dups, rots, nips, tucks (or some of the even more complex Factor stack shuffling words -- you have no idea!) makes locals look very attractive in comparison.",1284191602

1681155,comment,1680149,1681084,0,0,pauldirac137,,,"I've re-read the article, and now I think it's even more fantastic than I did at first.  There are just so many deep insights in it, I'm in awe.  Kudos to the author.  I especially like this statement:<p>""Because you need superhuman abilities to work without layers.""<p>The extreme Forth approach described in the article is all about doing away with all abstraction layers and optimizing everything at all layers simultaneously as much as possible, much like (brilliant analogy from the article) bacteria optimize every base pair in their DNA.  But humans _don't_ optimize every base pair in their DNA.  The author didn't pursue this, so I will, because it's important: humans don't do this because you couldn't evolve a system anywhere near as complex as a human _without_ having abstraction layers and the (unfortunate) lack of optimality that this entails.  The layers mean that the subsystems can evolve in a reasonably independent fashion (like software engineers not needing to change the hardware), but you sacrifice ultimate optimality for that.  It's a worthwhile trade-off: you get scalability.  With extreme-Forth you don't, which is why Forth programs solve small-scale problems, and Forth programmers simply avoid large-scale problems (or on a bad day, whine about how those large-scale problems shouldn't exist, yadda yadda).  Again, I point to my web browser problem; you may think that CSS is completely unnecessary, but it's a layer that makes life easier for people who do not have the time or expertise to optimize software or hardware, so it's part of the problem domain, deal with it!  Gimme my abstraction layers!<p>Seriously, I've seen Chuck Moore quoted as saying that we shouldn't name constants but use raw (magic) numbers instead, because by naming them we throw away valuable information that could be used for optimization.  That is serious layer-hatred going on there.<p>I personally am interested in stack languages for a completely different reason: stacks allow you to compose functions in a way that is much more cumbersome without a stack, and I think that's neat.  Not world-shaking, but neat.  I like to have the option to use local variables if that's the natural way to decompose the problem (an expression graph, as the article describes) and use the stack if _that's_ the natural way to decompose the problem (expression trees).  Why have only one tool in your toolbox when you can have two?",1284190120

Particularly where companies like Facebook are actively blessing private placements, and waving the ROFR, employees are pretty much getting most of the IPO benefits.  I'm not sure how much of this is a result of SOX, and how much is a result of squeamish CFOs not wanting to have to subject themselves to the requirements for transparency and predictability that the street requires - but we're certainly seeing a lot of private companies stay private a year longer than we did a decade ago.",1284189474

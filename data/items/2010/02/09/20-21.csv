I've never used them in Scala myself, but they are highlighted as a positive feature of Scala in this article, and I am inclined to believe the author when he says they are.<p>The insight here was just that implicit type conversion is very bad when you don't know it's happening. When you DO know it's happening -- because you imported the conversions -- and it's used to save brainstrokes (""codetree nodes""), then it can be very helpful.",1265749199

Are you suggesting that we should limit our opinions of other actions and only discuss legality? He never argued it should be illegal, but he argued we can do better. I fail to see the problem. There was a time when email spam wasn't illegal. Your attitude would have kept us from judging it (Hey, they need to make a buck too! Grandpa needs his viagra, and Nigerian's gotta eat) and ever making it illegal.<p>Note: I realize that ""applying your moral standards to others"" gets us people hating gays, etc. But the alternative  of not applying your moral judgment to anyone but yourself is also ridiculous. That would mean you can't call out lying politicians, greedy corporations, ""scamville,"" or anything else that most people don't support.",1265749185

They didn't ever sit down and say DOS or BASIC or Word was going to be the cornerstone of their business, they just did what they thought would be useful at the time until they managed to hit on something. You can tell because, though I can't say anything for their old BASIC's, DOS wasn't even very good! As Microsoft got big enough to parallelize this strategy, it turned into a kind of shotgun strategy where they simultaneously tried to build web browsers and gaming consoles and mobile phone operating systems and MP3 players and webmail and everything else. If you read <i>The Road Ahead</i>, Bill Gates writes about Wang, which was enormously successful but missed the PC wave just long enough to go out of business. After Microsoft's own close call with the internet (ironically around the time <i>The Road Ahead</i> was written and first published), I'm sure these fears intensified to the point where Microsoft started jumping after every hot new thing, be it multitouch, MP3 players, search engines, or whatnot.<p>The contrast to this is Apple in the respective Jobs eras, which focused intensely on building a few great products. It's a far riskier strategy--if Apple invents the Macintosh and no one wants one, what then?<p>Google's had a shotgun approach as well--I don't know why, but it seems like a good use of the talent they seem so intent on recruiting. Part of the shotgun approach is that some products are better than others, but a likely bad part of the approach is that you are prone to go chasing after every new trend.",1265747243

The only real question is whether someone is able to figure out a hack that makes brute force unnecessary and bumps the timetable forward, but as I mentioned above, so far nobody has, so we may just have to wait for full brain simulation to be feasible.<p>Apart from that, I'd agree with you: with a few notable exceptions, most Singularity inspired ""work"" has been very low ROI, amounting to little more than speculation about the future and how great it will be rather than actually doing something to ensure a good outcome.  There also seems to be a common delusion (again, with a few important exceptions) that AI will <i>automatically</i> be friendly without us needing to spend significant efforts towards that goal, which is very misguided.<p>...especially since a lot of the best funded and most focused AI research is taking place in China right now.  In the rest of the world the past failures of AI have made people assume that it's a fool's errand, so there's not a lot of money going towards it, which could be a real disaster - regardless of how friendly AI can be made in principle, it's pretty much assured that if the Chinese government gets there first, we're going to see some pretty nasty stuff (though an argument could be made that once any government gets there we're all screwed).",1265746729

If I didn't know my business well enough to close our first partnership with the top 4 US health insurer (paying) to develop an app we designed that will generate two patents, I'd bow out. We've closed a 5k deal, another 10k deal on the books about to close, and taken only 10k in angel money. That's not only understanding the company, it's understanding where the company is headed, and then working with my tech cofounder to implement like crazy til we get there. Plus, 'tech' of any type is a means to an end. One founder working on the tech and one founder working on the rest of the stuff that forms the means to the 'end' isn't always a recipe for disaster.",1265746540

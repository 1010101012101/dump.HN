I think the main problem would be to prove that you are not living in Sweden (the burden of proof is on you for the first 5 years). It seems that the requirement for not permanently living in Sweden is to permanently live  somewhere else - perpetually traveling the world doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough, you have to prove that you are a resident  somewhere else, usually by applying for residence and paying taxes there...",1408813155

8216241,comment,8214264,8215342,1,0,vidarh,,,"It&#x27;s not that &quot;anybody can achieve anything&quot;, but that we can almost always get <i>far better</i> at almost anything if we put effort into it.<p>E.g. I do powerlifting to stay fit. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be a world class athlete, but through consistency through the last ten years, I&#x27;m lifting at an advanced level for my weight/age class on all my lifts.<p>Could everyone do that? Probably not. Thought <i>most</i> people can likely get to my level with enough effort.<p>More importantly, <i>every</i> untrained person can improve massively, because the average untrained person is so massively far from their potential.<p>I lift 10-15 times more today than I did when I started. Unless you&#x27;ve got severe health problems or disabilities, start at a very advanced age, or a very good starting point, most people will &quot;easily&quot; be able to increase their lifts by at least a factor of 5 in a few years with 30-40 minutes 2-3 times a week. In fact, most total beginners can double or even triple their working weight within a month or two.<p>The same applies for most mental disciplines as well: We may not all make it to expert level in every discipline, but we can almost always multiply our starting skill level enough times over with some effort that most people who have not put in any effort in the field will be impressed.",1408813091

While I have no doubt you can find a company willing to hire you as a digital nomad, I definitely have a bunch of reservations about it.<p>We&#x27;ve had folks on the move quite a bit in the past (including traveling around in an RV). The biggest issue is that they tend not to be quite as plugged in as everyone else. Internet connections always seem to be spotty and there always seems to be other issues tugging at their attention (finding places to work, exploring, etc..).<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean they produced bad work (often it was very good), but it came at the expense of the rest of the team. When we needed them to answer a question or hop into a quick discussion they often weren&#x27;t around. It&#x27;s just a bad dynamic as far as the rest of the team goes.<p>We do hire contractors for very specific and targeted projects. In that mode nomads are just fine! They don&#x27;t need to fit into the broader team in a meaningful way and there is no expectation that they will. They come in for a few weeks or months and then move on. It works well and both sides are really happy with the arrangement.<p>Point being, you might have better luck both finding a job and being successful at it if you&#x27;re looking less for full-time roles and more for contract positions that complement the type of lifestyle you want to pursue.",1408813062

Every one I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it is primarily designed for dealing with large numbers of homogeneous machines, and only serve to add overhead (new syntax, a level of file name indirection) when dealing with individualized ones.<p>What I&#x27;ve ended up doing instead is keeping a simple tree of config files, which get run through a templating engine and then rsynced to the target host. For simple things there is zero overhead - etc/hosts is just the plain file that goes to all machines. But this system allows me to have eg one smartd.conf which contains all my disks, which is then split between machines.<p>A few things currently fall through the cracks (users,groups), but overall rebuilding a machine is a relatively painless process. I feel like there must be a better more standardized way though (which is why I keep looking at these tools). Any comments/experiences/etc ?",1408812826

I will say the docs are open source, so if you want to add a note about how to get something easier compiled on OS X or something, click the GitHub link in the upper right and you&#x27;re off and running :)<p>We get a lot of strong positives about how awesome our docs are, so I&#x27;m really interested in what you think we could do to improve them -- but they were absolutely not modelled on Chef and Puppets.  Chef has about 1000 pages of docs, Ansible covers the majority of everything in a dozen pages.  Most folks get up and running (with working playbooks running real applications) in 30 minutes or an hour.<p>My philosophy on docs are mainly to address things in the order folks will want to learn things, but also make it easy to hop over sections people will not.  Show examples, don&#x27;t make a reference manual.  Though there&#x27;s a need for reference content, which is where stuff like galaxy.ansible.com content and github.com/ansible/ansible-examples steps in, so you can see it put together.  More tutorials I think would still be useful in the main docs.  But yeah, a discussion on what you like to see differently would be interesting.<p>While I do understand you have to do something to install the program, what you have to do to configure it once installed is pretty short, and the install itself should still only take a few minutes.  I&#x27;ll give you the fact that Macs are not Linux, but they are getting there :)<p>I&#x27;m interested in your Mavericks error and you should definitely stop by the list about that one, or just consider the homebrew install.<p>Another great thing to do since you are already are on a Mac is just start doing your development on Linux in a VM :) Not that we require it, we don&#x27;t... but it&#x27;s great when you&#x27;ve got a real package manager stock!<p>Another easy thing you can do is just checkout the git source and do &quot;source ./hacking/env-setup&quot; and then you are running straight out of source.

I find posts like this delightful, because I can point to them and say &quot;see, here is proof that even code written with the best of intentions can still have bugs.&quot;<p>Programmers tend to fall into (at least) two camps: the skeptics and the pragmatists.<p>Sometimes when I report a finding, programmers accuse me in one way or another of messing something up because “that can’t possibly be failing.”  Those are the skeptics, using incredulousness almost like a shield to protect their worldview.  They tend to have an up-close/what’s right in front of them approach to programming, are prolific and usually take a positive stance on programming.<p>At other times, reporting a finding is met with resignation, almost like “please work around it because we just don’t need this right now”.  Those are the pragmatists, taking the long view/forest for the trees approach, knowing that programming is more than the some of its parts but also that it’s a miracle it even works at all.  They are the daydreamers and sometimes are perceived as negative or defeatist.<p>I was a pragmatist for as long as I could remember, but had a change of heart working with others in professional settings.  I saw that certain things like databases or unix filesystems could largely be relied upon to work in a deterministic manner, like they created a scaffolding that helps one stay grounded in reality.  They help one command a very mathematical/deliberate demeanor, and overcome setbacks by treating bugs as something to be expected but still tractable.<p>But here is one of those bugs, where the floor seemed to fall out from under our feet.  One day I mentioned that “SSL isn’t working” and about half the office flipped out on me and the other half rolled their eyes and had me track it down:<p><a href=""https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=694667"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=694667</a><p>The gist of it is that OpenSSL was failing when the MTU was 1496 instead of 1500, because of path MTU discovery failing and SSL thinking it was a MITM attack and closing (at least, that is how I remember it, I am probably futzing some details).<p>That was odd behavior to me, because I see SSL as something that should be a layer above TCP and not bother with the implementation details of underlying layers.  It should operate under the assumption that there is always a man in the middle.  If you can open a stream to a server, you should be able to send secure data over it.<p>Anyway, we fixed the router setting and got back to work.  All told I probably lost a day or two of productivity, because the office network had been running just fine for years and so I discounted it for a long time until I ruled out every other possibility.  I’ve hit crazy bugs like this at least once a year, and regret not documenting them I suppose.  Usually by the time they are fixed, people have forgotten the initial shock, but they still remember that you are the one weirdo who always seems to break everything.",1408810797

By the time of the Alexander Sarcophagus the subtlety of the sculpture has far outstripped the colors identified and applied by Brinkmann. This does not mean that Brinkmann has left the path of accurate reconstruction; it may mean that his ultimate goal is impossibly distant. The colors he has identified on later pieces are clearly just underpainting for a far more realistic final finish. This was the process used in Renaissance oil paintings of equivalent visual sophistication. The assumption that the painting was as sophisticated as the figures is an extremely conservative one. The artistic and manual skills required for realistic sculpting are far greater than those required for life-like painting of a finished figure. And the painting task was a relaxed one, far more amenable to messing around until the artist got it right. So painting was easier, less risky and, because of weathering, constantly in demand. It is reasonable to conclude that until sculpting reached its zenith, painting of figures was substantially more sophisticated than the figures themselves. With luck, Brinkmann will eventually find a piece with all the layers intact.&quot;</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://100swallows.wordpress.com/2008/08/20/greek-statues-were-painted/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://100swallows.wordpress.com/2008/08/20/greek-statues-we...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.simorgh.de/objects/091008_1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.simorgh.de/objects/091008_1/</a>",1408810719

You might be eating high-carb but low calorie, causing insulin spikes, extreme hunger, and protein wasting. It&#x27;s not an easy diet to follow and it might even be counterproductive.<p>This is based on a false dichotomy of dieting sustainably low carb or unsustainably starving yourself.<p>Let&#x27;s say we have someone who is 6&#x27; and 260lbs.  To get to that state you need to consistently eat a diet of around 4000 calories.  If that person eats 2000 calories of ANYTHING for the rest of their life, which should be completely sustainable, they will not only lose the weight (down to about 180 lbs), they will keep it off.<p>On the other hand, if that person continues to eat 4000 calories but they change their diet entirely to a ketogenic diet, guess what: they will still be fat.<p>The point is that when we are dealing with the 30% of Americans who are now obese, the low hanging fruit is in simply eating less.  There may or may not be a suboptimization in macronutrient composition, I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s definitely wrong.

I&#x27;ve heard art critics refer to the color as a sign of the &#x27;pristine&#x27; and &#x27;pure&#x27; aspects of Greco-Roman[0] art, completely ignoring the fact that they were actually painted with incredibly bright colors 2000 years ago.<p>(Of course, one can make a somewhat postmodern argument that the piece of art with the colors as they appear today should be evaluated in its own right, independently of what it was 2000 years ago, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what they were going for).<p>[0] Another fun fact - we actually have very few Greek art (statues) to study. Most of our knowledge of Greek sculpture comes from Roman reproductions, along with a few pieces that were hidden in tombs, etc. for centuries and forgotten. The Greeks, unlike the Romans, made a lot of statues in metals, and these were subsequently melted down for the materials[1].

Whenever someone gets injured, they think back to the last exercise they did and find some imperfection in their form.  They then attribute their injury to not using perfect form.  Similarly, whenever a bug appears, there is a tendency to find a unit test that would have caught the bug, and therefore attribute it to insufficient testing.<p>The real value of testing (and good form) can only be demonstrated by having a criteria for good testing and seeing if following this reduces the number of bugs.",1408810509

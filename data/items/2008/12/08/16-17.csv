How much of this applies to you depends on your age (I'm 22), but this is when most people should be setting aside a little money for higher-risk investments.  Risk doesn't mean invest into a poorly-performing company and start praying, but try to find a couple profitable micro-caps or small-caps and stick $500-$1k or so into them.  Personally, I look for foreign micro-caps that run great profit margins and make physical products that people need (primarily healthcare / transportation).  Patented products are even better.<p>Not only that, but right now there are plenty of large-cap companies that have lost a lot of value not because they're bad companies or losing money, but because everyone is simply dumping stocks out of fear.<p>Either way, do your research on the balance sheets + income statements, take a good look at how they well they approach their core competencies/products and make an informed decision.

If I remember correctly Newton was of the opinion that light is particle in nature.

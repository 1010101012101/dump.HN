6068972,comment,6068360,6068694,14,0,kragen,,,"Yes, the scoping in your example is lexical.  That&#x27;s why ugly returns k regardless of where you call it from; we can reason lexically to show that.<p>The i in ugly is lexically resolved to refer to a particular declaration, the one on the line below it.  Scheme&#x27;s lexical scoping rules are not the only possible lexical scoping rules.  A lexical scoping system does not cease to be lexical simply because it is not the same as Scheme&#x27;s lexical scoping.  For it to be non-lexical, the scoping would have to depend on something other than the lexical structure of the program.  For example, you could just as well have a dynamically-scoped JS in which ugly&#x27;s return value would depend on its caller&#x27;s binding for i, and in which calling a function with a free i from within example would make example&#x27;s binding for i visible to that other function, but that isn&#x27;t the way JS works.<p>It&#x27;s quite reasonable to argue about whether that scoping is <i>sane</i>, and indeed with &quot;let&quot;, the ES folks are giving us a saner binding construct; but it is certainly the case that the relationship between the declaration and the use of a variable is established by the lexical structure of the program text, not the dynamic structure of the executing program.",1374223861

I struggle at them, and written below is why:<p>Assumptions:<p>1. You follow around 100 people.<p>2. 50% of them tweet 5 times a day.<p>3. 20% of them tweet once.<p>4. 10% of them tweet once in a week.<p>5. 10% of them tweet 10 times a day.<p>This is a rough estimate for the people I follow.<p>If you calculate there is a total of 250 + 20 + 100 = 370 tweets per day.<p>Ignoring 50% of tweets as junk.<p>You have aproxly 200 tweets.<p>How I use twitter?<p>I like going to twitter.com and reading all the tweets.<p>But skimming 200 tweets is again a pain, so much of trouble. Besides few of the tweets might call for action. There would be some links that you would want to read later, there would be some friends who would be going out for coffee, and you might want to join them, etc. etc.<p>One idea would be to unfollow people, few of them might get offended and then your relations might ruin or something like that.<p>Another would be to create a fake profile and then follow only the ones you want to and are interested in.<p>Third would be to have some desktop plugin that would notify with the tweets, but that would be a distraction if you are working and are in the middle of something.<p>Fourth way is via lists, I do not like going to twitter.com/<my_user_name>/lists/xyz  // the url does not look good.<p>So here is the question:<p>1. How do people on HN manage their timeline?  (Like there are things like Zero Inbox http://inboxzero.com/ rule for managing email)<p><i></i>Is there something for tweets as well, or collectively can we brainstorm over here and come up with something?<i></i><p>2. What other functionalities do you wish tweeter had, like categorizing a tweet in your timeline, saving it for further action etc. etc.",1374221422

Or before/after each commit?<p>What would you guys recommend to track the performance of your own website over time, or gather deep-level metrics?<p>Could you use something like PhantomJS to achieve this?<p>Are there any existing open-source projects that already do this?<p>Cheers ,
Victor",1374221179

They were actively developing ways to help the NSA.<p>Google, Apple, Yahoo, Facebook, etc. have lost trust because of this whole spying thing. To say that these companies were somehow &quot;victims&quot; is troubling to me. As far as I can tell the Constitution of the U.S.A is the law. Anything introduced to purposely subvert the constitution is illegal and should be challenged.<p>With companies like Google who have a lot of weight (money) to just hand over <i>anything</i> private to the NSA without actually calling them on it, is disturbing. These NSA programs have been going on for a very long time; collecting everyone&#x27;s (american AND their allies) private communications. I&#x27;m sorry, but victim? No way. Instead of keeping to the &quot;cloud&quot; mentality there could have been more work on protecting users with proper encryption techniques. No body has done this. Yes, Yahoo may have lost in secret, but they also didn&#x27;t fight the NSA&#x27;s spying by creating technologies or build upon current technologies to protect their users.<p>I trusted Google to keep my gmail/youtube/etc. information private for me and those whom I talk to. Advertisements bothered me, yes, so I stopped communicating about confidential things to do with business, etc. I have been a Google user since a week after gmail was introduced.<p>I have deleted all my connections to Google thanks to these revelations.<p>In order for Google, Facebook or Microsoft to gain my trust again, there needs to be innovation in the encryption world where I can seamlessly encrypt ON THE CLIENT and decrypt ON THE CLIENT machine with out storing <i>anything</i> to do with the private keys on the cloud or trust Google with the private keys. Would this ever happen? Probably not. Google is an Ad company. Privacy isn&#x27;t exactly their biggest strong point. Same goes for the others.",1374220952

Portman brought the two adults and four of the children back to Port Blair. But the man and the woman soon started to get sick and then died, probably from exposure to Western diseases like smallpox, measles, and influenza, to which they would have had little or no resistance. So Portman returned the four children to North Sentinel Island and released them with gifts for the rest of the tribe.

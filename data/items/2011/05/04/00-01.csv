I love vingnette on my phone, the filters and effects open up a whole new realm of creativity with shooting photos.  im not usually trying to go all photojournilistic and document things as much as im trying to convey a feeling or state of mind.  also, my phone camera may be 8 mp, but that doesent mean jack without good glass, the lens is crap on my phone, its just the modern replacement for polaroids. so why not tack on some effects to make it more ""human"" and try to convey the feeling u may have had at that time.  Also, if u take thousands of photos, and dont take the time to swlect a few ""winners"" every so often, then your just lazy.  it takes supprisingly little time to pick out whats good, u know as soon as u see it.

My father is disabled and my mother passed away during my junior year of high school, so I had zero financial support from my family for school.<p>Due to financial considerations, I chose a state school where I had some scholarships instead of the big name tech school that accepted me. Let me tell you, I have regretted it ever since.<p>The simple fact is that if you -can- get into a top tier school like MIT then you should go. The caliber of your fellow students will be much, much higher than at a state school, and that alone is priceless. One of the best things about college is networking and, for hackers, finding like-minded individuals to make things with. Once you factor in faculties, facilities, and opportunities, it should be a no brainer.<p>Regarding money, almost no college students have credit history, but that doesn't stop almost all of them from getting loans. I would be very surprised if you didn't qualify for student loans, even if you have to get them from a private organization / bank. I would talk to MIT's admissions/financial aid office, as they can probably help you piece together how you can pay for things.<p>Don't let money stand between you and your education. The connections you'll make and the experiences you'll have at MIT will be worth the extra money you pay. Of course you'll also like college a hell of a lot more. I know plenty of people who, like me, settled for a state school and have been bored out of their minds.<p>tl;dr -- Go to MIT and find a way to make the finances work.",1304469859

This fear is only exacerbated by the fact that no detailed demographic projections for radical life extension scenario have been conducted so far. This study explores different demographic scenarios and population projections, in order to clarify what could be the demographic consequences of a successful biomedical war on aging. A general conclusion of this study is that population changes are surprisingly slow in their response to a dramatic life extension. For example, we applied the cohort-component method of population projections to 2005 Swedish population for several scenarios of life extension and a fertility schedule observed in 2005. Even for very long 100-year projection horizon, with the most radical life extension scenario (assuming no aging at all after age 60), the total population increases by 22% only (from 9.1 to 11.0 million). Moreover, if some members of society reject to use new anti-aging technologies for some religious or any other reasons (inconvenience, non-compliance, fear of side effects, costs, etc.), then the total population size may even decrease over time. Thus, even in the case of the most radical life extension scenario, population growth could be relatively slow and may not necessarily lead to overpopulation. Therefore, the real concerns should be placed not on the threat of catastrophic population consequences (overpopulation), but rather on such potential obstacles to a success of biomedical war on aging, as scientific, organizational, and financial limitations.""",1304469634

To really replicate all of this in code you would have to go beyond the basic data structures and syntax of that programming language. And at that point might as well just have sql. It's a paradigm and an approach expressed through its own syntax, you can't easily copy all of it in a totally different programming language..<p>As for checking for type safety, I think frameworks that do sql-to-object mapping (with type safety), and also handle cache for you, are a very useful thing.

I think it's only necessary when there's incorrect prior knowledge.<p>If interested, here's my take/rant about it:<p>I believe that prior knowledge and misconceptions can change how people deal and interpret new information. This can help or it can hurt the learning process.<p>It can help because it often makes new knowledge more likely to ""stick."" For example, a soccer fan is more likely to remember soccer scores [1]. I know there's other research that indicate more prior knowledge leads to quicker learning, but I don't remember them off the top of my head.<p>It can hurt in much of the same ways Derek Muller describes. When hearing new information it can easily be misinterpreted to match current knowledge. For example, anecdotally, those only familiar with the words ""negative"" (bad) and ""reinforcement"" (adding/reaffirming) are more likely to misinterpret ""negative reinforcement"" to mean ""punishing behavior by adding something bad"" instead of ""rewarding behavior by taking something bad away."" I believe there were similar findings/studies within statistics. Another common one is F=mv as shown in Muller's videos. I'm sure there are plenty more examples.<p>I believe Derek Muller's problem with Khan's videos is that they might not challenge incorrect previous knowledge. I agree with Muller and personally feel that Khan Academy will likely encounter some of these same problems when students watch the videos.<p>But, I also believe that the other half of Khan Academy (exercises) provide feedback that videos alone otherwise do not have. I believe that the requirement for mastery through the exercises can and will challenge at least some of these misconceptions. Particularly if the questions are good questions.<p>I also believe that Khan Academy is going to find themselves in a position where they can potentially have a lot of interesting data. I'd love to be able to see whether they can use this data to find some of these common misconceptions and then improve videos and/or questions. In the very least, I believe that their exercises will serve as a good metric to see where misconceptions are being poorly addressed.<p>We also have to keep in mind that, at least in the pilot in Los Altos school district, these videos are not the only source where students are learning. They still have time with teachers where these misconceptions can be addressed. In addition to that, they'll have the opportunity to review the videos to contrast, reflect on what lead to the misunderstanding, and hopefully reaffirm the new knowledge.<p>tldr - I believe Khan Academy's exercises and class/teacher time might help deal with the issue of misconceptions.<p></rant><p>[1] Morris, 1981 - <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1981.tb01777.x/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1981....</a>",1304467939

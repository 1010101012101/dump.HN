Perhaps a visual ""hello, world"" program. Or a code-golf exercise. My personal ""hello, world"" for learning a new language is usually a basic 1D cellular automata.<p>Once you've written your hello world, you'll have answered many of your questions. Next, rewrite it! Is your code idiomatic? What are some common idioms, and why do they exist? Could you make it shorter?<p>Next, extend it. Can you use it from the web? What would it take? What about letting people customize your helloworld? etc etc. See what it feels like to develop in the new language, even though the entire ""project"" cycle could conceivably be done in a single day. (Disclaimer: not by me. It takes me, at least, two months of part-time hacking to feel affection for a language).<p>After that kind of a learning process -- which isn't terribly onerous; it's the sort of thing you end up doing with almost any interesting language -- you'll look back at these questions and laugh.<p>And, if you aren't willing to go through that sort of ""learning lite"", why bother asking the questions?<p>( If you're looking for enlightenment about the process of actually using Lisp, in book form, I recommend <i>Practical</i> <i>Common</i> <i>Lisp</i>, which is available as a free pdf ).",1253150210

If the latter database still preserves the case, then the underscore on an all-caps name is even uglier.<p>3) driversLicenses.id is not the same thing as vehicles.id. The point is to name the column what it is so the meaning is preserved everywhere. If you don't use aliases then you can't distinguish them in the result set. If you do use aliases then an app that reads and updates has to now remember that the alias isn't its real name.<p>4) I haven't noticed the mental cache problem myself, sorry. But a table called ""vehicle"" isn't a vehicle.

The postfixes don't even encode type, but information about how the value is defined. A books table with a ""ddc"" column isn't hurt by adding ""_class"", but you're also communicating that the value comes from an international standard classification system (Dewey Decimal). I don't know of a database system that can encode this meaning in types, domains or check constraints.<p>On critique of _skidmarks and StudlyCaps, I guess I should have emphasized the concept of coding to what the toolchain and environment's conventions suggests, such as putting ""When In Rome, Always Do As Romans Do"" in boldcase at the top of the sidebar.

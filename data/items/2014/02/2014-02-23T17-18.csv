Even if you don&#x27;t participate in SMS games (quizzes, tv voting, etc) there services like emergency top up (for prepaid sims) that you probably used at least once or twice. Those are usually also provided by mobile aggregators itself or through MA partners, and they do know on which channel request came, what VAS app is that, how often you do this and etc. Ideally they can cross check your phone number on all of their services and content provider services to get plenty info to know who you are and what you will buy next.",1393178351

7286718,comment,7285759,7285759,2,0,kordless,,,"I&#x27;m working on a highly distributed cloud framework that implements a Bitcoin operated OpenStack deployment.  Basically, you install OpenStack at your house or small data center, launch a small instance with some Open Source code that turns the instance into a virtual appliance controller, and then join a pool of other providers/users.  The pool operator provides search functions (like geo) and Bitcoin addresses so others can launch a server by just paying coin to a given address.  No usernames, no passwords.  Secure, reliable payments for providers to get ROI on excess/hobby capacity.  Fast, easy, and dirt cheap.<p>The initial pool run by myself will provide low trust, low cost, highly transient instances.  Chaos Monkey model.  Market prices will likely fluctuate based on instance launch demand.<p>The concept encourages multiple pools running the code, so there will be future opportunity in building up a brand that attracts a given set of infrastructure providers and/or service companies to band together and coop.  This could be done to leverage features like geo location, excess capacity requirements, feature sets, or trust levels through accreditation.  Think about a handful of Silicon Valley companies sharing infrastructure among themselves and being able to balance the costs through Bitcoin.  They could also share cooperatively in the areas of operational competence and security, given they have a good relationship between the companies (which many do).<p>For me, it&#x27;s been a long haul working on the concept, especially considering I had to get OpenStack accessible for the average user.  Now I&#x27;m mostly done with my OpenStack scripts, I&#x27;m finally cranking out the code for the controller and have it launching instances by sending in Bitcoin to the instance addresses.  It&#x27;s pretty slick when you use it.<p>More work has to be done, so it&#x27;ll be a few months before I do a general release of the first pool.  If you or anyone else is interested in this concept, building a new pool brand, or building the services that need to be build around it, hit me up.  My email is in my profile.",1393178282

7286715,comment,7285987,7285987,5,0,IsaacL,,,"I have to admit that I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Ray Kurzweil - he&#x27;s one of a large group of people who believe that accelerating change will almost certainly be good. I think the singularity could be good, but it could also be really bad, and it&#x27;s important to spend some resources on making sure it goes well.<p>MIRI (formally the Singularity Institute) has a mixed reputation around these parts, but after reading fairly widely over the last year I think they have the deepest thinking on the topic of AI. Here&#x27;s a concise summary of their worldview: <a href=""http://intelligence.org/2013/05/05/five-theses-two-lemmas-and-a-couple-of-strategic-implications/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intelligence.org/2013/05/05/five-theses-two-lemmas-an...</a><p>As I see it, their argument goes:<p>1. It&#x27;s tempting to think of AIs becoming either our willing servants or integrating nicely with human society. In actuality, AIs will likely be able to bootstrap themselves to superintelligence extremely rapidly; we&#x27;ll soon be dealing with alien minds that we fundamentally can&#x27;t understand, and there will be little stopping the AI/AIs from doing whatever they want.<p>2. It&#x27;s tempting to think, from analogy to the smartest human beings, that superintelligent AIs would be wise and benevolent. In actuality, a superintelligent AI could easily have strange or bizarre goals. I find this makes more sense if you think of AIs as &quot;hyperefficient optimisers&quot;, as the word &quot;intelligence&quot; has some misleading connotations.<p>3. OK, well surely we can leave the AIs with weird goals to do their thing, and build other AIs to do useful things, like cure cancer or research nuclear fusion? The trouble is that even an innocuous goal, when given to an alien superintelligence, will very likely end badly. An AI programmed to compute PI would realise that it could compute PI more efficiently by hacking all available computer systems on the planet and installing copies of itself. Or developing nanotechnology and converting all matter in the solar system into extra computational capacity. You have to explicitly the program the AI to not do this, and defining the set of things the AI should not do is a hard problem. (Remember that &#x27;common sense&#x27; and &#x27;empathy&#x27; are human abilities, and there&#x27;s no reason that an AI would have anything like them).<p>4./5. OK, well, we&#x27;ll build an AI with the goal of maximising the happiness of humanity. But then the AI ends up building a Brave-New-World style dystopia, or kidnaps everyone and hooks them up to heroin drips to ensure they are in constant opiated bliss. It&#x27;s really hard to come up with a good set of values to program into an AI that doesn&#x27;t omit some important human value (like consciousness, or diversity, or novelty, or creativity, or whatever).<p>I&#x27;m glad that Peter Norvig (director of research at Google) is concerned about the issue of friendly AI. I&#x27;m curious to hear what other HN readers think of these ideas.<p>Anticipating some common objections I hear from friends:<p><i>How could a superintelligent AI have a stupid goal like computing Pi?/Wouldn&#x27;t it be smart enough to break any controls we put on it?</i><p>I think this objection assumes an AI would be wired together like a typical intelligent human mind. If you think of an AI as a pure optimisation process, it&#x27;s clear that it would have no reason to reprogram the ultimate goals it begins with.<p><i>If they&#x27;re smarter than us, we should just let the AI take over/AIs are like our children, ultimately we should leave them free to do whatever they want</i><p>Again, this assumes the AIs are like super-powered human minds and that they will do <i>interesting</i> things once they take over, like contemplate the deep mysteries of the universe. But it&#x27;s clearly possible for the AIs to devote themselves to really trivial tasks, like calculating digits of Pi for all eternity.",1393178267

7286712,comment,7285522,7286676,1,0,huxley,,,"To clear up my own confusion, the 56 bytes only comes in when using bcrypt for encrypting vs hashing, however the &quot;72 character&quot; password limit for hashing is actually 18 words of 32-bits.<p><a href=""http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/wiki/wikitech/430719#430719"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/wiki/wikitech/430719#4...</a><p>&quot;Note that much confusion on the web about key lengths with bcrypt (&#x27;72&#x27; vs. &#x27;56&#x27; bytes) comes from the fact that there are TWO algorithms called &#x27;bcrypt&#x27; which both happen to use Blowfish. One is an encryption algorithm, and the other is a hash algorithm. While they share a common core component, the purposes are thereby entirely different. For the sake of the bcrypt HASHING/key-strengthening algorithm (which we care about now), the 72-byte input parameter is in no way a theoretical problem at all, even for non-Latin UTF-8 based passphrases which eat up 3 bytes per unicode point. The reason is because the text-based passphrase itself needs to &#x27;somehow&#x27; be converted into 18 words of 32-bits each anyway. (If we were _encrypting_ then the 56 bytes limit for THAT algorithm would come into play.) Even if you restrict your attention to ASCII it would not be ideal to simply convert ASCII code points to a (zero-padded) juxtaposed stream of 32-bit chunks anyway, because, well for one thing, you would be throwing away entropy due to not using the upper 1-bit range in each char, not to mention the range of unavailable non-printable ASCII characters.&quot;",1393178243

I got much better at motivation over the last year by thinking in exactly the opposite way from what this article recommends. I accepted that I had virtually no willpower, and that I wasn&#x27;t just going to just magically develop some, and that I didn&#x27;t need it anyway. Instead I needed to get more skilled at &#x27;coaxing&#x27; myself into doing things – at steering my feelings into more constructive areas, and then letting my desires drive my actions. I applied my tiny amount of willpower to this &#x27;steering&#x27;, rather than trying to use it to drag myself kicking and screaming into doing things, which it clearly is not powerful enough to do. It worked, and I&#x27;m much happier. You can&#x27;t &quot;just&quot; do stuff if you don&#x27;t feel like it, as this article suggests. That&#x27;s completely unsustainable. Any approach amounting to &quot;just fucking do it&quot; is going to last only as along as that little glimmer of resolve lasts, which is obviously short term. Instead you need to break down the wall between your gut desires and your cerebral strategies, and make those two parts of yourself acknowledge each other and collaborate.",1393177990

This is very profitable to those who print money and very unprofitable for those who holds these money but need resources instead. So printing money is just a redistributive program that takes resources from savers. In severe form, from anybody having money, even for a short term (this is called hyperinflation). So when we&#x27;re talking about &quot;money has to come from somewhere&quot;, we&#x27;re of course talking about resources, &quot;printing money&quot; is just a sneaky way to extract resources from those who delayed their consumption of resources they produced, foolishly trusting the government to preserve their value by exchanging them for a government-controlled money. And these resources are not infinite, they are scarce. Moreover, if you start extracting a lot of resources from those foolish people, they start noticing and no longer entrust their savings to the government that takes too much from them. And then the government finds itself with a lot of people who were promised non-scarce money but don&#x27;t have any resources to back them up.

What works and doesn&#x27;t work tends to vary wildly from person to person, and at best people tend to find answers that let them scrape by, not answers that really fix the problem.<p>And I think it&#x27;s quite possible that there <i>isn&#x27;t</i> an organizational solution. It seems very likely to me that humans have evolved to basically be as lazy as we can get away with.<p>It makes sense as a survival strategy to put in exactly as much effort as it takes to get your basic needs met. For most of us throughout history, this meant working our asses off to subsist. Pushing ourselves further than that would be a dangerous gamble on our resources.<p>So in first world countries today, many people have this problem where we can subsist on relatively little effort, compared to, say, a farmer in 8000 BC. So our motivation scales down to that context. Send someone with that little motivation back to 8000 BC and ask them to start farming, and they&#x27;d starve - except that their motivation would probably rescale to fit the new context.<p>And yes, there are those who find motivation easy, who don&#x27;t have these problems. But I think they are significant outliers.<p>So my point is that I&#x27;m not sure we can really ramp up our motivation without finding ways to stress ourselves the hell out. And I don&#x27;t mean &quot;this report is due tomorrow&quot; stress, but &quot;winter is in one month, and I don&#x27;t want to die&quot; stress.<p>I&#x27;d really rather have the pill that turns me into an outlier.",1393176407

Data Plane Development Kit, which lets you skip the kernel IP stack (which takes thousands of CPU cycles to process) and do packet processing in userland taking just tens to hundreds of cycles per packet. <a href=""http://dpdk.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dpdk.org/</a><p>I wish OS developers saw this as a problem. There is no reason kernel stacks should be so slow for tasks where all processing is done in the kernel. (For packets destined to userspace, you&#x27;ve got the syscall overhead to deal with.)<p>I recently tested the Linux network stack&#x27;s PPS performance with an Intel X520 10GbE NIC. I used Debian testing, with the 3.12 kernel. My destination machine was an i7-3930K at stock speed. I wrote a simple kernel module adding an NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING hook returning NF_DROP with no processing, which would be the simplest possible code path. For a packet generator, I used another older machine with another X520, using the &quot;pfsend&quot; tool included with PF_RING, and the card in PF_RING DNA mode. That was easily able to saturate the link at line rate (14.8M PPS).<p>The result: the kernel was only able to sustain about 2.8M PPS.<p>I then loaded the DNA driver on the destination machine, used the included &quot;pfcount&quot; tool, and no packet drops - it was receiving the full 14M PPS.<p>I tested DPDK recently and had similar results.<p>I also modified the Linux ixgbe driver ixgbe_clean_rx_irq() function, and added a step in between the &quot;fetch packets from RX ring&quot; and &quot;put packet in SKB and send to network stack&quot; functions. Even when I added a bunch of useless comparisons for each packet, I was able to get ~12-13M PPS. I could get line rate by just dropping and not doing any processing.",1393176215

If there could be an incentive to make money with solar a lot more people might be willing to &quot;invest&quot; in it.<p>So my idea is similar to carbon credits. It is a lot easier to measure the amount of energy generated by the solar panels. So the amount of clean energy generated by  the households could be sold off the organisations with a bigger carbon footprint. Similar to how advertising networks sell page views to the advertisers.The unit of energy is well established. We could set the price of 1 watt of clean energy to a bidder.<p>So the question remains why the bidder would want to buy this clean energy? I don&#x27;t have an answer to that besides that it could be a good marketing tactic. For very large cooperation it could be a chance to gain some good PR (if they really care about that).<p>The people participating in this program would have to install a chip that would monitor the generation of this clean energy. With networked chips like tessel and spark.io coming out soon it could become pretty easy for people installing solar panels to connect these panels to a local cloud where there could be an automatic transfer of funds to bank accounts of people depending upon the amount of clean energy that they have generated. Now for a give area this energy should be the same for a standard solar panel since the are will receive more or less the same sunlight.

I&#x27;m not too concerned either way, to be honest.<p>2) Memory / CPU issues: Anyone concerned about these issues wouldn&#x27;t make a game in Python and Pygame.  I&#x27;m just a hobbyist who enjoys the language and the particular library I used.<p>3) Audio Latency: That is purely from the screen recording.  There is no latency when you play it on your machine (to my knowledge).<p>4) Purpose of this project: I have been programming for 7 months, 2 of which I spent on this project.  I never expected this project to get this much attention, but I suppose the cross-over appeal of Python and Mario is quite high.  Fundamentally this was a learning activity to create something I thought was cool.  Like I explained here: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBbzYKMfx5Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBbzYKMfx5Y</a> , I knew basically nothing about making a platformer before this project.  I still have a lot to learn.",1393175387

You&#x27;re assuming Dualism.<p>No.  Dualism is the idea that our minds are non-physical.  I say minds are fully physical, and all thinking happens in the physical realm.  But somehow the results of this thinking are perceived and sensed by a self-aware being as &quot;self&quot; in a way that other physical processes are not.<p>> The patterns of electro-chemical reactions that occur when I inflict pain on another human cause that human to emote in a way that I can relate to because of the electro-chemical reactions that have been happening in me and those around me since before my birth.<p>Exactly.  You are extrapolating <i>by analogy</i> that other people experience pain in the same way you do, because you cannot experience their pain directly in the way that they do.  But this analogy of thinking is just an assumption.  And it certainly offers no insight into why you are self-aware and a computer (a very different but still complex electrical system) is not (we assume).",1393175240

But they&#x27;re practically irrelevant to password hashing†. It does not matter if you use a constant time comparison for your password hashes; to see why, try to design the actual timing attack on the password hash compare (if you&#x27;ve never done this before, start by demonstrating to yourself that you can design a timing attack against an HMAC comparison).<p>The OWASP site&#x27;s password storage guidance is particularly bad, and I recommend that developers avoid that page altogether. The page began as a litany of very bad advice (reversible encryption, salted hashes), and when it was pointed out that secure password hashes like scrypt were the right answer, the authors decided instead to &quot;teach the controversy&quot;. OWASP is very political, and not managed by computer scientists.<p>† <i>The post we&#x27;re commenting on inaccurately says that the hypothetical timing attack it describes has been done before, but links to Boneh&#x27;s TLS timing attack paper.

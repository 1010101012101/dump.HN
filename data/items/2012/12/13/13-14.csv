The double E is obvious: building the kit. The other two, the potentially Left Brained or Right Brained approach to programming. All three of them have one thing in common: A structured, _logical_ approach to solving problems.<p>If there is anything to lament, it is that we still have the tug of war between left and right brain approaches. The reality is that one size, indeed, does not fit all. We should accept that and move on to getting the work appropriately done.",1355406950

Of course, calculus, statistics, and linear algebra also required. For the university trained, brush up (or curse your university for not requiring you to learn these subjects).

They can even speed up the take over process by giving additional features to the customers. Once the users start to move to the competitors product because they have realized it's much better at doing the job the competitor can start to make the existing feature set user experience better like removing the really not needed additional mouse click.<p>The first products company will be having problems at this point, because they really need to start thinking new features the users will like and think how to make the user experience better, but to match the performance of the features they really need to start digging on the old code which might be messy as hell. Matching the performance of the competitor at this point is really costly, because you either have to create it again from scratch or start digging around the code and see where you can optimize. Once the performance has been optimized you might have lost ton of users and revenue.<p>While the first products company is trying to handle the performance issues the competitor will of course move further and further away and might even incrementally change some of the features of the product and at the same time teach the users to use it.<p>Then again if the first product had good performance from the start the competitor can not take advantage of this and you can keep up by giving the users better user experience.<p>Now someone give me enough money to compete with Facebook!

Wills&#x27; version is also pretty good, but not all that much better than Brown&#x27;s. As you can see, I think Western Swing is great stuff (my last.fm is utterly full of it), and my secret theory is that there were only 3 big Western Swing bands because there were only 3 pedal steel players talented enough in the 30s and 40s to do the style justice. Before it came along, there wasn&#x27;t all that much popular music that really used the electric guitar.<p>Anyway, I digressed pretty hard, but I think I&#x27;ve made my point somewhere in there...",1375844393

6170548,comment,6148512,6148512,1,0,jamespcole2,,,"Having been a dev for 10 years, 5 of which were almost exclusively using .net and the other half using open source web tech I feel like I can add something to the discussion.  I&#x27;ve recently got back into .net for a couple of recent projects after a few years away from it.  First off c# is awesome, it&#x27;s a great language.<p>The main problem I have have with it is the clunkiness of the tools.  Windows itself is pretty poor as a server OS and dev environment(IMHO), it&#x27;s unnecessarily heavy, has too many useless features, is difficult to automate, and more.  Powershell is ok but not really as simple/powerful/portable as bash.  SQL server I guess is ok as a db engine but using it is clunky(again feature bloat really hobbles it).  I find getting an environment set up with vagrant, capistrano etc. with windows much more complex than it needs to be.<p>Also one of the really noticeable differences is the overall quality of the community.  It&#x27;s much harder to find good answers to problems when using .net/Windows than with other environments and platforms in my experience.  In general I find .net devs more interested in maintaining the status quo than exploring new ideas and tech(massive generalisation but I&#x27;m sure I can&#x27;t be the only one to notice this).  Also nearly every tutorial about modern web tech is written for *nix environments as the general community support and interest in .net/Windows seems to be non-existent.<p>An observation that I&#x27;ve noticed lately when attending tech events and conferences is that Windows just isn&#x27;t even on the radar.  It&#x27;s not that people actively dislike it or openly criticise it, it&#x27;s just not even considered or discussed, it&#x27;s old tech, it&#x27;s boring, it&#x27;s clunky.",1375844335

We discovered that almost all these large transactions were the descendants of a single large transaction involving 90,000 Bitcoins which took place on November 8th 2010, and that the subgraph of these transactions contains many strange looking chains and fork-merge structures, in which a large balance is either transferred within a few hours through hundreds of temporary intermediate accounts, or split into many small amounts which are sent to different accounts only in order to be recombined shortly afterwards into essentially the same amount in a new account.</i><p>- Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir, <i>Quantitative Analysis of the Full Bitcoin Transaction Graph.</i><p>Then the perceived value and the actual value would be off significantly.<p>So, while I might not phrase it in quite as strong terms as the person you&#x27;re responding to does, I do find reason to be somewhat cautious about the whole enterprise.",1375844219

There were some text mode browsers that worked on Unix only.  The popular graphical browser was Mosaic[1] which started out as Unix/X windows only.  It was run on Sun, HP, IBM, SGI etc workstations (32 bit).<p>At that time popular Windows was still 16 bit.  It didn&#x27;t even include TCP/IP with various third party stacks (for a price) and later a Microsoft stack for Windows 3.11 for Workgroups.  Some brave people did start porting Mosaic but it was hard because a completely different GUI API and semantics was needed, as well as dealing with the cramped machines compared to the 32 bit workstations.  It was late 1994 before these ports became somewhat usable.<p>Netscape was formed around then, and the big difference was they made their code portable to multiple guis from the very beginning (a lot easier than retrofitting it).  By 1995 every platform had to have TCP/IP and a web browser to be relevant.  The web spread because no one was in charge, and everything had to work everywhere on a wide variety of screen sizes, operating systems and user environments.<p>ie it was the diversity of systems out there that was the cause, not that you could buy the PC architecture from different companies.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)</a>",1375843389

There are also lots of organizations with the power to kill you, yet you won&#x27;t lose your sleep, because they have nothing to gain from that, so you are pretty sure that it won&#x27;t happen. It could be argued that the central banks have a lot to lose to Bitcoin, so they should attack it. But after giving it a bit of thought, I remembered that most people just try to pass the current problems to the next guy (think of presidents, bankers, etc), so why would they bother? Right now, Bitcoin is not big enough to be a threat to anyone. It will keep growing as a threat, but everyone will pass the problem to the next guy, until Bitcoin becomes too big to be stopped. If there is a future that makes sense, this is it. Bitcoin takes over because lazy politicians don&#x27;t do what they have to (in this crazy world, where their function seem to be to ruin everything), and ironically, that will be the best for everyone.<p>> For the same reason you should care about what cryptography theorists, physicists, and doctors have to say.<p>I was thinking about economists mostly (which in many cases will have vested interests), but still, if it works it works. Many theorists have spoken against the phone, the internet, the email, the aeroplanes, etc, and see what happened. I&#x27;m no cryptographer, but Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t seem like something that would require one to begin with since all its crypto was done at the user level, it&#x27;s pretty simple. Satoshi didn&#x27;t try to create his own hashing algorithm or anything like that.<p>> You are calling the informed opinions of dozens of experts in cryptography and economics &quot;raging&quot; because they are saying that the system you love and support is based on dubious technical and economic ideas. It sounds more like you started out believing that Bitcoin is the future and are not willing to accept any argument that concludes anything else.<p>There are quite informed people on the other side too. So what do we do about them? Ignore them? I said raging, because Bitcoin has this crazy effect on <i>a lot</i> of people. They will hate Bitcoin for no reason, spread outright lies, and try to convince everyone that it is a scam. Why?

6170430,comment,6166016,6166679,2,0,6d0debc071,,,"Nope. Not as such anyway. I was saying you can&#x27;t seem to go from paying steady dollars for a brand name to paying pennies per article.<p>Personally I think there&#x27;s a minimum pain point for parting with your money, and if the value of a product falls beneath that for enough people, then it&#x27;s just not viable under any conditions in that market - it won&#x27;t matter how well you do what you do, or how cheaply, you&#x27;ll have to change the product somewhat. I suspect newspapers are going that way for a couple of reasons. One being that to appreciate high quality news requires a high-quality education so they can&#x27;t leverage that aspect of things particularly well to win that way.<p>I think. -chews her lip- I <i>suspect</i> if you want to look at news as a product then you have to look at where its value comes from and start splitting that out and optimising for it. Information <i>is</i> part of it - where does most of that come from these days? Press releases. Journal articles - which is to say when scientists want to push their press releases. Aggregating others news sites - which is to say the press releases of press releases. Most of the information content of news these days is aggregation, not writing.<p>The commentary? The commentary in news isn&#x27;t up to much. (Well, see appreciating HQ news requires HQ ed - not a good value proposition, I suspect.) You read a couple of books on the history of an issue and then read the newspaper about it and the newspaper rarely has anything to say that would impress a first year student. And there&#x27;s a more serious problem represented by comments - if people ever manage to fix the rating systems to allow trust metrics to generalise properly - how many reporters can you retain vs how many commentators are their on the net? Someone out there is going to be an expert, if we ever find a way to leverage trustworthy reputation in a meaningful manner then the odds are the people who are going to be listened to aren&#x27;t in your newsroom.<p>What&#x27;s the other service news serves? I think that one&#x27;s obviously entertainment.<p>So. If you wanted to do news and make money at it... how might you do it? I guess you might make your newspaper a bot, and have it process press releases. And you would tag those with metadata and run a ticker service - like the stock markets. And when a subject was clicked on in the ticker, that would link into short summaries of all the press releases on the subject - ordered chronologically and by how closely they related to the original subject - as objects, linked tiles perhaps, on the same page. Commentary from the top rating authors according to your rating system could be in boxes connected to the individual stories when someone clicked to expand them, or rolled over them.<p>And that might be how people could use your service to explore the information side of things from a perspective that they couldn&#x27;t do on their own. Your service could become an aggregation/visual research tool that people could use to rapidly walk through very large subject areas.<p>And the other side of things? Entertainment? I think we&#x27;ve seen it. I think it&#x27;s reddit. Oh, maybe not Reddit reddit - but something similar. You might organise your front page using drag and drop stack rating of the summary tiles and just do it so that it doesn&#x27;t organise them by relational metadata but by time and popularity.<p>---------------<p>I don&#x27;t know, that&#x27;s one way you might try to shake things up - and that&#x27;s a service that I might consider buying into because it would allow much more powerful capabilities for researching a subject than google does.<p>However, the long and the short of it is: I think news is going to have to change fairly radically to leverage what value there is left in it. Because at the moment you have to look at a newspaper and ask yourself: What does it actually do in terms of creating value? Does it give people any new ways of looking at things, does it make anything easier for people that they won&#x27;t shortly be able to do for themselves?<p>I can&#x27;t see it managing to reach over that pain barrier of actually parting with your money unless there are no less painful alternatives available otherwise. If it&#x27;s just a middle man, and nothing else besides, then I think its disease is terminal.",1375841923

6170422,comment,6150773,6169755,1,0,Gormo,,,"> Is your issue with universalism, then? That the policies fail to discriminate between different groups for different reasons? Would it be more proper to bring in communitarianism?<p>Universalism is wrong, granted, but that&#x27;s not even the crux of it; the issue is that the &quot;groups&quot; you&#x27;re likely referring to are also, in most cases, arbitrary logical constructs.  The appropriate function of law - as distinct from policy - is to mediate disputes among <i>actual individuals</i>, not presumptive categories of people, according to the expectations, implicit and explicit, that give structure to the relationships among <i>those</i> particular people.  (And the proper role of policy is to govern the activities of the state itself, as a particular institution, and not to insert itself uninvited into people&#x27;s social arrangements, overriding their manifest preferences).<p>> Except that this has been true for all of history, and it&#x27;s by systematizing it that we gain some measure of control over it. Instead of conducting warfare every time people disagree, we have means for communicating and compromising as a first resort.<p>This is simply incorrect; for the vast majority of history, law was generated via bottom-up emergent processes, that attempted to map the boundaries of the <i>natural</i> law inherent in each particular dispute.  We&#x27;ve had a functional system of common law and equity operating this way for over 800 years.<p>The notion that law is something that people design, a priori, and apply to society as a whole from the top down, is a novelty that&#x27;s been dominant only for about a century.  I find it bizarrely perplexing that you seem to regard legislation as the <i>only</i> viable form of law.<p>> You keep straw-manning me by implying that I&#x27;m proposing a dictatorship masquerading as a democracy<p>This is a meta-straw-man, considering I said nothing of the sort. I&#x27;m arguing against the &quot;state equals society&quot; formula, which I entirely acknowledge is a form of democracy - no masquerade - but which is also clearly a form of totalitarianism.  In this post, you seem to be articulating a model that diverges from this formula: you&#x27;re re-purposing the term &quot;state&quot; to describe not an organized institution established for the purpose of exercising power, but to any structure that emerges within any social context.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the way we were using the terminology when we began the conversation, and I&#x27;ll point out that you began by objecting to distinguishing <i>government</i> from society, not <i>state</i> (however defined) from society.<p>> I simply do not find nations to be a useful social construct.<p>I agree that nations are far too broad and coarse to be considered substantive social contexts, but - and this is an assumption, so correct me if I&#x27;m wrong - I have a feeling that you would articulate merely smaller versions of nations as the appropriate scope within which to equate the state with society.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to point out is that every particular grouping of individual human beings is a society unto itself, and is in a sense <i>sovereign</i> unto itself: democracy isn&#x27;t about people being arbitrarily shoehorned into classes or categories or purely abstract &quot;communities&quot;, which then &quot;express&quot; themselves in the form of a system of law.  Democracy is about people <i>creating</i> substantive social contexts - families, friendships, businesses, romantic relationships, weekly D&D groups, religious congregations - and <i>manifesting</i> law <i>particular to that social context</i> through their mutually-sustained interactions.<p>What we think of as the institutions of law - judicial institutions, not legislative ones - are merely a failsafe mechanism to be appealed to when disputes and controversies are not sufficiently contained and addressed within their originating social context, and threaten to escalate and spill over into other people&#x27;s lives.<p>There&#x27;s no room here for some legislative body, composed of strangers who you haven&#x27;t met, to aggregate everyone&#x27;s distinct circumstances, abstract them into a conceptual model, and then make prescriptive rules, again in the abstract, on the basis of that model. And when people talk about &quot;the state&quot; and &quot;government&quot; in the sense that began this thread, they&#x27;re talking about this form of legislative state, not using those terms to describe the bottom-up patterns that formalize the mechanisms of concrete and particular social contexts.<p>You say &quot;they aren&#x27;t third parties&quot;, but it&#x27;s absurd to suggest that any actual government operating on that legislative-state model can be regarded as anything other than a particular institution administered by particular people, not one of whom, odds are, is you.",1375841764

Not having a vision for the culture of a startup is, in my experience, plain crazy for the mid-to-long term health of the company.<p>Not having a long-term vision for the company itself also seems crazy for any of the founders. I always have a long-term vision. It usually overlaps heavily with my other founders. It changes when it is clearly the wrong path, but then we come up with a new vision and it certainly doesn&#x27;t take months to develop. Sure, you take input from the team to smooth out the rough spots, but it is the job of the founders to be the genesis.<p>For goodness sakes, the center of my pitch when raising VC money is getting people to buy into the long-term vision.

It involves developing vision for where the company will go, who the customer is and why they would use your product. You don&#x27;t just take a random stab in the dark every time you try to get user adoption and don&#x27;t immediately see 100 million users.

Tried Nestle Boost because I didn&#x27;t want to wait for Soylent.<p>It left me hungry.<p>Reportedly, Soylent doesn&#x27;t do that.<p>I also tried Ensure very briefly, and got the same impression, but I&#x27;m only like 98% sure that, like Boost, it will also leave me hungry.",1375840951

I am a co-founder and can confirm that we are doing something very similar but are only in the Authentication space. LaunchKey supports Private Keys stored on your device among other factors. We have iOS, Android, PHP, Ruby, Python and Javascript SDKs with a WordPress plugin and other integrations coming soon. Our system also allows session based or transactional authentication.<p>That is all good, but one of LaunchKey&#x27;s biggest features is the Privacy. Each site/app you login to is provided a unique ID that cannot be traced or tracked among sites, ad networks, etc. If twitter opens their 2-factor login up for 3rd Party, it will surely be using this login data in other ways.<p>Check out LaunchKey (<a href=""https://launchkey.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://launchkey.com</a>) and let me know if you have any questions.<p>p.s. Our app and system also lets you log out from your device.",1375840887

I&#x27;d guess most modern cars have at least a dozen PowerPC chips.<p>And both ARM and PowerPC outsel x86 by a hell of a lot more than a factor of 2. It&#x27;s at least a factor of 10, and that&#x27;s almost certainly low too. x86, in terms of units sold, is an extremely small market.",1375840834

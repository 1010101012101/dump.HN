2362084,comment,2360411,2361907,0,0,kposehn,,,"Hmm.<p>Microsoft provides the operating system itself and supporting software and infrastructure for that business. Their business model is/was to drive adoption and standardization of the computer operating system by and large with Windows. They did so through aggressive tactics and eventually made it pretty much ubiquitous. However, they only provide the core OS that the machine runs on (and a bunch of other software) - they did not develop, market, distribute and support the machine. Further, they provide no infrastructure by and large to facilitate the transactions themselves.<p>Now, this made sense as they grew. The PC market was a bunch of companies running into an empty room and staking their claim. Microsoft simply said ""let's make sure everyone uses our flag to stake their claim."" Suddenly you had a crowded room with almost everyone waving a windows flag. They did not want to impede the growth of the market by controlling every step of the equation and at the time that was the right way to do it. They allowed an ecosystem to grow up around them, wanting to be the standard by which it all grew and developed.<p>However, the game has changed now. Apple uses the best UX they can make with the nicest hardware they can design to create desire. People want Apple products and that desire relies on everything about the product living up to the expectation placed on it. With this in mind, they ask for their cut of what goes through their infrastructure which supports this marketing machine. It would be different if they did not provide this level of investment or if they didn't actually handle the fulfillment.<p>To answer more directly, I don't think it is a question of fairness, I simply think it is a comparison of apples and oranges. Apple has a fundamentally different philosophy and this reflects in their business model.<p>That said, I do not agree with their policy of not allowing a link from an app to a place to purchase externally - I feel it doesn't add to the UX at all to enforce that and some manner of user choice is called for ( '-')-p",1300924742

I'd like you to give me some examples where people's code is treated like the plague for a prejudice such as those.<p>2) Of course developers are going to be valued more highly in a community _centered_ around development.  Whose valued more highly at an art showing, the painter or a curator?<p>3) Treating disrespect and generalizations with more disrespect and generalizations has proven time and again to be an ineffective technique that's wielded by sensationalists.  I don't see how you can expect anyone to take such melodrama seriously.<p>4) Your value to an open source project is directly correlated to the quality and quantity of knowledge and code you provide to the project.  It should be obvious that more experienced people will be valued much higher than a noob who wants to join.  Everyone initially takes a beating or two for submitting poor patches, but those who aren't deterred by petty bullshit stick around and actually learn a thing or two while becoming developers.<p>Honestly I couldn't care less if people put off by blunt commentary on their contributions don't want to participate.

It was originally built by systems administrators, so I'd say that the system is more ""accreted"" (like a stalactite) rather than really designed.  Samba is incredibly hard to extend and maintain and the primary developers are more wankerish and ideologically motivated than commercial vendors would like.  Primarily for these reasons, but also for licensing reasons, EMC, NetApp, other storage vendors, Oracle, and now Apple have all switched over to private implementations.  I believe Sun's effort started long before protocol documentation was available from Microsoft, but the Samba developers do deserve credit for doing some incredibly painful reverse engineering, even if that reverse engineering is sometimes incomplete.",1300924146

FAB is 'forced to defend himself' <i>cough</i> and after he finishes bouncing the perps head off the walls and is waiting for the police and ambulance to arrive (perp is un/semi-conscious), eh enters the motel room, recognises the three laptops, and puts them in the boot of his car.<p>Police arrive.

My carrot consumption is down since I don't often eat the big ones.<p>There's also way too many baby carrots per bag and most of them go bad within a few days (crusty and dry with white blemishes on the skin). I'm sure you could re-peel them since it's just the skin, but that's a lot of effort for the size.",1300921321

2361879,comment,2359180,2360049,0,0,diploid,,,"True but I think if you look at the grassroots movement of open source a different picture emerges. The hacker appeal of printing a kidney is far beyond that of a vacuum. The only reason it hasn't caught on so far with the hardware hackers pushing these printers is because the open source 3d printers are so far away from being able to actually print that.<p>When the price of open source 3d printers decreases to a couple hundred dollars and their quality has steadily improved for 5-10 years will it matter which cash cows corporations are chasing? In a world where you can just go to your computer and print a kidney for yourself they may just be entirely irrelevant.<p>disclaimer: if you print yourself a kidney, please get a certified doctor to install it :)<p>EDIT: watching the ted talk. He's using custom machines, very impressive in-body printing.",1300921274

I use two imported fonts from Google Web Fonts on the normal version of my site, and it'd be nice to have them on the mobile version too.<p>2. Disqus support. It's a little disheartening to tap View Comments and see ""Comments are closed"" on every entry, especially when they're not. I'm pretty sure Disqus has a mobile view- I've gotten it when using WPtouch.<p>Regardless, this is basically the slickest web app interface I've seen on my iPad. (Possibly a bit slow on my iPad 1, but that might just be my server to be honest.) Congrats!",1300921260

Current leaders are wordpress, joomla, Dotnet nuke, Umbraco and drupal, but there are many others.  Word press has around 13,000 plugins for everything from ecommerce to social networks but all most all them have that.<p>One consideration is that dotnetnuke and umbraco target the enterprise so can be somewhat heavy weight.  More modern CMSs are lighter weight.  Orchard.net, for example is a .net mvc3 application whose core is very small and even the basic features are design as external modules.",1300921230

More analogous would be a Bitcoin transaction vs. dollars sent by mail.<p>Paypal and credit cards are just transactional layers on top a currency, they only represent the underlying currency. The actual exchange of the currency can take an arbitrary length of time (if it even happens at all).<p>Nothing precludes Bitcoin from having the same services built on top of it. When the time comes for Bitcoin to have truly instant transactions, the market will create this necessary layer.",1300921211

Most implementations only check if read() returns -1 then abort, without checking for EAGAIN, not to mention EINTR, or some other subtleties like making sure not to request more than SSIZE_MAX bytes. The randombytes function in NaCl does it right, unfortunately libsodium did their own thing.<p>If you use Python, read from os.urandom, which is a wrapper to the system&#x27;s CSPRNG.

Any strategy that consistently beat the market, and that could be expressed as a deterministic algorithm, and that was something other than a transient effect of no real value, could be used to drain the market of its capital in a matter of months -- and therefore it would be. The market would collapse and businesses would refuse to trust equities.<p>My point?

An aspect of Bitcoin&#x27;s fundamental design (transparent transaction records) was supposed to prevent _exactly_ the sort of thing that happened with Mt.

This is true because only states, organizations which have monopoly control over the legitimate use of force, can effectively provide police protection for transactions to be consistent, reliable and trustworthy. Bitcoin&#x27;s transparent transaction record, designed to make states obsolete in this traditional role, was not enough to fix the problem. It became too tempting to  subvert this design, because there&#x27;s no one who will handcuff you if you try.<p>Consider, perhaps Mt. Gox _itself_ was the perpetrator of this theft.

Identify the three most important decisions that need to get made that week, and who should make those decisions. Who is closest to the work involved? “This is how you push decision-making into the facts,” she says.<p>Citing James March’s book A Primer on Decision Making, she recommends that managers exclude themselves from big decisions as much as possible. “Somehow people’s egos get invested in making decisions,” Scott says. “If they get left out, they feel almost a loss of personhood. So you get ego-based decisions instead of fact-based decisions. The more you push yourself and your managers out of the process, the better your decisions will be.”<p>Most of all, don’t let decisions get pushed up. “A lot of times you see decisions get kicked up to the more senior level, and so they get made by people who happen to be sitting around a certain table, not the people who know the facts. Don’t let this happen.”",1393376503

In every deploy a new schema is created for the deployed version and all stored procedures are added to it from the repository. The new version of the application will use the new schema while the old version still uses the old schema. When the old schema is no longer needed it can be dropped with all procedures.<p>I have seen other ways to deploy stored procedures but these often require being very careful about function API:s and delta scripts.",1393376458

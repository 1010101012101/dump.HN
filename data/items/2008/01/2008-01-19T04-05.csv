There will be other  terms associated with a funding that will have a significant impact on how much you make when you sell (for a reasonable range of exits).

100776,comment,100732,100732,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Don't get locked on the pre-money valuation: the other terms tend to have a much bigger impact on how much you actually make.<p>What's your plan for paying the investor back? Will you need a follow on round? How much, when, and why. What risks about your startup will you have reduced before you need to raise another round. Can you be acquired based on what you will achieve with this first round.<p>Have you talked to other teams this investor has worked with? You have to assign a value to the expertise, advice, and connections that this investor will bring. Most angel investors supply more than money. That's one of the reasons teams want to take money from Ycombinator, they have a well defined methodology and a constellation of other folks they can connect you with who can help you succeed.<p>You are negotiating the start of a relationship that will normally only end when your firm goes bankrupt or is sold: this is not a transaction this is a long term partnership.",1200716996

They will give a horrible valuation and take a large part of your company.  First phase funding in the ~100k range I would look for angel investors or get the people involved to contribute the money.  Either raise 500k from a VC and have a much more aggressive growth strategy if that is the route you want to go, or raise 50k from friends/angels/yourselves and minimize costs as much as possible.",1200716831

It's a consumer, social, Web site. We don't have a lot of users yet, and we don't have revenue, but the concept seems to be a good one, and I think that's how the investor heard of us and approached us.",1200716535
100772,comment,100717,100717,0,0,tjr,,,"As I've mentioned here before, I've done work on avionics software, which probably has some of the strictest development constraints you'll find.<p>Generally, these constraints include some things that we'd probably all agree are good: consistent naming conventions, for example.  But these constraints also encourage very simplistic coding, such as, no recursion.<p>Code that follows the constraints tends to be extremely procedural, and tries to avoid complexities of the language.  This is for the purpose of verifying that the code really will do what we claim it will.  If someone, say, messed up at recursion, it could exhaust too much memory and the box could die.<p>The result is very robust, but it lacks character.  It's rarely beautiful and elegant.  But we are about as sure as we can be that it works.<p>[That is not to say that recursive, elegant code does not work, just that, it's harder for a team of hot-swappable software verifiers, potentially just out of college, to match the code up with the requirements, or to ensure that non-obvious code is correct.]",1200716365

It's certainly a bit of a chicken answer, but you can provide numbers such as revenue, product developments, and users to give an idea of what a proper valuation would be.  The idea is to not price yourself out of their range during the first conversation.",1200715472

There are probably zero investors who are going to put as little as $100k into a company that come anywhere close. So out of the gate I'd require a higher valuation from other investors.",1200715441

How do we vote?!&quot;<p>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll come up with a simple set of universally applicable rules and move on.<p>I do know that my abuse-free internet experience is very much a bubble, and every time I have been given the opportunity to see the experience of a &quot;woman with an opinion&quot; online I get to realize this. So let&#x27;s as a society say &quot;this isn&#x27;t acceptable&quot; and then deal with the much more difficult question of &quot;what to do about it&quot;.<p>In any other commercial venue if a patron started shouting racist and sexist epithets, we would be ok with the owner throwing them out.

It&#x27;s pretty obvious from a common sense standpoint that when the public doesn&#x27;t like a stock, its price goes down...  when everyone absolutely hates that stocks guts, it&#x27;s usually an indication that it&#x27;s undervalued in relation to its fundamentals and it might be a good time to pick it up while it&#x27;s on sale... Likewise, when everyone is enamored with a stock, it&#x27;s probably overhyped and a good time to sell into it...  By looking at this simple graph, you can clearly see that there&#x27;s a distinct connection between the two, and that sentiment leads price movement for sure.  The ECB recently came out with a study that confirms the concept of sentiment leading price...  PsychSignal has an algo here that shows it plain as day! :)",1437069553

I have a twitter account I use for personal marketing and I never ever post anything off topic or related to politics or whatever the hot meme of the day is.  I only post information related to the very specific niche that I am covering.  I pulled up my twitter feed recently and there are biotech people commenting on Greece.  There are startup gurus retweeting Greece.  If it&#x27;s not Greece it&#x27;s whatever is the hot topic of the day like <insert social issue that even saying you don&#x27;t care about will result in social excommunication> or the Ukraine war or whatever.

If it&#x27;s not that much better, then the paperwork/training hassle isn&#x27;t gonna be worth it for my team to switch. One example is the Hipchat/Slack discussion. We used Hipchat before Slack was a thing. Slack looks awesome. But is it 10x more awesome than Hipchat? I&#x27;ve never been convinced, and it&#x27;s just not worth the hassle of setting everyone up with Slack accounts and software for the incremental improvement.<p>Right now, bug tracking is tedious but manageable. You need to make it 10x easier, 10x cheaper, or 10x more features (or some smaller combination thereof) in order for people to consider it a no-brainer to switch.<p>And to be honest, that&#x27;s a tall order. You risk turning into a Salesforce-esque nightmare where you&#x27;re trying to do everything at once.

Credit card companies make money when you use your card. As such, they want you to use your card as much as possible. Anything which increases the friction of a card transaction reduces how much people use their cards, and thus directly impacts their bottom line.<p>Not requiring a PIN is an example of this. If your customers have to memorize and enter a PIN, this added friction will cause at least some of them to pay cash (or whatever other payment method) instead. That&#x27;s lost revenue.<p>Similarly, it shocks many people to learn that credit card merchant agreements <i>forbid</i> requiring customers to show ID as part of the transaction. Seems like a sensible way to fight fraud, right? But it also adds friction, which reduces credit card use rates, which hurts card company profits, so they don&#x27;t let you do that.<p>This stuff is all a careful tradeoff. They know how much they lose to fraud, and how much they gain in legitimate transactions from making things easier. The goal is not zero fraud, but rather whatever level of fraud is optimal for their profits, which is almost certainly not zero.",1437069114

If you cheat (or harass) in one game, your account can be banned across all games. This means that if you care about your account on one game still existing, you&#x27;re disincentivized from cheating in other games, even if you don&#x27;t care about them.<p>I play League of Legends regularly, and Riot Games has put in huge amounts of work in figuring out a way to discipline abusive players that will actually induce them to reform. They have shown that most people, when <i>branded</i> as abusive, will often reform their behavior immediately - as if they did not realize (or did not internalize) what kind of person they were being. See, for example, <a href=""http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/6/7500045/riot-games-league-of-legends-bans-rewards-behavior"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/6/7500045/riot-games-league-of...</a> . But it&#x27;s saddening that all of Riot&#x27;s work in reforming players or banning them if they can&#x27;t get along with others cannot be used to weed out these toxic players in <i>other</i> games. I love gaming, but, for me, the absolute worst thing about this hobby is how awful everyone is to each other, and I would love to see a systematic solution.<p>I wish something like Steam&#x27;s centralized identity existed across online forums. I wish we used one account everywhere, and the use of a widely-connected account was required to sign up to things - but the details of who you are, and how to associate your identity on one site with your identity on another site, is totally masked to everyone. Site owners and users cannot tell that userA on reddit is also userA on, say, some Disqus blog. But your <i>reputation</i> would still be preserved across sites: if you were reported as a spammer or a bully or a cheater on one site, it would be visible to the other sites you were on. And if those sites wanted to ban you based on your common reputation, they could.<p>This puts a large burden on the identity management platform. They have to handle everyone&#x27;s privacy and security, deal with accounts being hacked and used for spam or abuse, provide mechanisms for people to prove their behavior has improved and remove black marks from their records, deal with websites that submit false abuse claims, etc. And (hopefully) they have to be resilient to law enforcement trying to use these records to complete expose users on every website. But at least they could do it in <i>one place</i>, instead of every website having to solve all of these problems independently.<p>It seems to me that good behavior in &#x27;tribal&#x27; human society was enforced by having to, well, remain in one&#x27;s tribe, and having to convince everyone to put up with you if you want to survive.

It also runs the advanced &quot;autonomy&quot; algorithms that allow the spacecraft to check the status of each system and, if necessary, correct any problems, switch to backup systems or contact operators on Earth for help.<p>Guidance and Control<p>New Horizons must be oriented in a particular direction to collect data with its scientific instruments, communicate with Earth, or maneuver through space. Attitude determination – knowing which direction New Horizons is facing – is performed using star-tracking cameras, Inertial Measurement Units (containing sophisticated gyroscopes and accelerometers that measure rotation and horizontal/vertical motion), and digital solar sensors. Attitude control for the spacecraft – whether in a steady, three-axis pointing mode or in a spin-stabilized mode – is accomplished using thrusters.<p>The IMUs and star trackers provide constant positional information to the spacecraft&#x27;s Guidance and Control processor, which like the command and data handling processor is a <i>12-MHz Mongoose V</i>. New Horizons carries two copies at each of these units for redundancy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/139889main_PressKit12_05.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/139889main_PressKit12_05.pdf</a><p>--<p>Detailed specifications for the Mongoose-V MIPS R3000 Rad-Hard Processor:<p><a href=""http://synova.com/proc/mg5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://synova.com/proc/mg5.html</a>",1437068807

For one, does that mean that you need to rev your VCS version every time your language changes? What about when your language revs its AST, but not the language itself? Is your VCS version now no longer backwards compatible with old versions?<p>Second, I think there&#x27;s a significant amount of overhead and new technology here. Most DVCS&#x27;s currently use hash-based filesystems for storing history. If you replace simple data diffs with semantic transformations then you have to find some portable way of encoding that. If you don&#x27;t want the implementation to be language-specific than you have to find some language-agnostic encoding system that can also recognize that the textual diff and the alpha-rename are identical commits.<p>IMHO, I would rather have metadata on commits. That way you can always fall back to plain text and all the old tools (like an ancient vi) continue to still be usable, but more advanced language-specific tooling could recognize these things and provide a simple view to the user.",1437068414

For better or for worse, it&#x27;s how we do things. The American revolution was just a logical extension to the legal structures that had been evolving in the United Kingdom for hundreds of years.<p>I can see the appeal of throwing out the concept of property rights if you, well, own no property, which was entirely the case for the vast majority of people living in Russian in 1917.<p>However, here in the United States, we&#x27;ve taken another approach, and that is to encourage ownership and participation in the legal and market structures that define our society. We want more homeowners, more intellectual property owners, and more equity owners.<p>The more people we have benefitting from these fantasies, the more likely that these fantasies continue.<p>I think for the intents of this discussion, we&#x27;ve already tried out the &quot;communist&quot; approach to digital media ownership on the Internet. We got to where we are right now because we&#x27;ve basically abandoned intellectual property. But we didn&#x27;t get rid of ownership. There are plenty of profitable companies who deal in hosting, distributing and organizing digital media who don&#x27;t track nor care about who owns anything.<p>Just like with the communist experiments on the grand scale of the Soviet Union, property ownership doesn&#x27;t go away entirely, it just lays in the hands of a select few to the detriment of everyone else. It&#x27;s not like you could ever stroll in to Stalin&#x27;s house and borrow his hat without asking.<p>Now, if we could just get more private entities in the Western world to realize that all of their ownership stems from the fantasies of a social contract between a people and it&#x27;s government, we might be able to get somewhere. Acting like the government is always the enemy is absurd. You can&#x27;t have a corporation without government or some other system for managing the state of ownership... hmm, what&#x27;s that technology that showed up recently related to coming to consensus on who owns what on a shared public ledger?",1437067911

9898544,comment,9894342,9897865,0,0,davidamarquis,,,"> Not really, Kahneman is talking about doing better or worse than expected, not about your best or worst performance.<p>At a given point in time there are two quantities we need to worry about: how the teacher expects the student to perform at that point in time and the student&#x27;s ability to perform at that point in time.<p>If the teacher is rational and has seen the student perform many times these quantities will be the same. I think the outcome is probably optimized if these quantities are the same at all times but in the real world there may large disparities in the values which can fluctuate over time.<p>Nevertheless, suppose it were the case that the values are always equal. Then Kahneman&#x27;s hypothesis is obviously wrong. The student will perform better than expected roughly the same number of times they perform worse than expected (in the long run, obviously).<p>Regression to the mean exists, yes, but has no impact on the distribution of the events of being above the mean or below the mean.<p>I supposed that Kahneman would recognize this fact and he his reference to regression to the mean was based on a  more complicated but much more realistic model where the expectation is not always aligned with reality. In such a model there must be a mechanism for relating the two quantities after each new performance/test/review.<p>I tried to think of how this model would work and suggested Kahneman meant that expectations were adjusted based on previous best values. I should have been clearer that other mechanisms were possible and that I was only guessing which Kahneman meant. Then I argued that based on my experience this is a poor model of how teachers punish/reward their students in general because it is unnatural and unhelpful to the task at hand. As this model is not valid his conclusion that people are incentivized to punish each other is specious.",1437067428

9898537,comment,9895790,9898013,0,0,Solarsail,,,"A possibly irrelevant nostalgic detour, but I&#x27;m reminded of a thought experiment I contributed to once [1]..  Called Mars 9 Tons at a Time.  Basically use Zubrin&#x27;s Mars Direct as the baseline plan, but do it without the Ares 5 he described or another HLV.  Which has the effect that we would launch everything direct to Mars, no rendezvous or docking prior to the Martian surface.  Primarily on the hypothesis that docking the parts together would add the cost of an assembly facility, and complicating the components enough to be dock-able together or heavily suboptimal to support simple assembly.<p>But to avoid the costs of the Ares V, we wanted to do the entire thing using nothing but existing off-the-shelf available LVs to do the entire thing. If we&#x27;d gone the route of even a small custom LV, we would have the constant overhead of maintaining multiple launch pads that sat idle for 2 years at a time, just to launch something each launch window to Mars.  Instead, our plan began with the Delta IV-H lobbing payloads trans-Mars.  It has a payload of just over ~9T doing that.  It could also fly three or four payloads per launch window, Vandenburg and the Cape, both at the start and the end of the window for a two week turnaround on each launch pad.  Of course, suboptimal timing and suboptimal inclinations will cut into that 9T slightly.  Further, we could make use of things like the Mitsubishi H-IIA [2], Atlas V 551 or Heavy (would need modest new development, or the 551 which is a bit weaker), Ariane V and maybe Proton (tho Proton is quite weak on high energy flights).  Falcon 9 Heavy could eventually be added to that list (I think we were already talking about F9H in 2007...).  That gets you maybe 6-9 payloads per launch window to Mars, of 6-9 tons depending on the launcher.  That was our working budget for each payload.<p>We managed to account for just about everything to do with the surface base using nothing but those small payloads...  Planned out a standard design for a small descent vehicle in I think 1500kg to 2500kg which could land most of the rest of the mass as payload.  We could do Earthworks (or Marsworks...  dirtmoving / digging) using using some small remote-controlled construction equipment of 2-3T each. [3]  Food, water and other supplies could pretty easily fit in smallish pieces like that.  Used solar panels in place of Mars Direct&#x27;s nuke for political feasibility / scalability to small payload deliveries.  Also talked a bit about assembling a shelter using either the landed capsules for rooms, or assembling rooms from parts (I don&#x27;t remember which).  A part I was a bit uneasy about that some others thought was trivial enough, was building a new launch vehicle from parts on the surface...  We&#x27;d be using small modular segments to build stages, scaffolding to assemble everything together and connect the stages, and all of this would be done outdoors.  I was kinda worried about getting sand between the staging components or in the engines.<p>The part we didn&#x27;t manage to fit into the initial constraints of 9 ton payloads, all direct-to-Mars, was the actual crew transport there (we were fine-ish for the return).  We stretched kinda far, pulled compromises nobody would really take, and got a 1-crew capsule to weigh in at 11T-12T.  And that&#x27;s with basically no redundancy!  The entire thing would be a small can with a solar wing for power, life support for 6 months, and no way for the pilot to survive a launch failure from Earth.  The capsule would fly straight to Mars, pilot would don a suit, depressurize the capsule and get in a MOOSE-alike [4] module and travel to the Martian surface in that.  They would also be dependent on the entry trajectory for their life, as they&#x27;d have to walk to base on landing.<p>From there our plans started to look a bit more &quot;traditional&quot; with either an HLV snuck in there just for the crew (and not the base) or orbital assembly of an orbital ship.  Say, something with plenty of life support of its own, just does Earth-Mars-Earth and gets the crew to and from the base.  The ship itself would be a rather substantial project to build, but at least it could ignore landing much payload.  And the ascent vehicle from Mars would only need to worry about orbit, not escape velocity.<p>[1]<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20070810053610/http://uplink.space.com/postlist.php?Cat=&Board=businesstech&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20070810053610/http://uplink.spa...</a>  Ok, so the thread Mars 9 Tons at a Time wasn&#x27;t archived at all.

Even on a large phone display, viewing the content between the two was very distracting. Also, they both had icons for twitter and Facebook. I gave them some feedback regarding the design and said that I felt it was a UX mistake.  The VP of design got back to me and said, very politely, that he disagreed with my assessment. He went on to say basically that an increase in shares means an increase in page views which means an increase in ad impressions, and thus income. With TNW being an ad-supported company, this directly relates to the quantity and quality of our content. This lead me to feel that the single driving motivation was not that their users had a good experience, but that they maximized revenue. From a user point of view, I feel that&#x27;s wrong. From a business point of view, it does make sense.<p>Regarding who is responsible for the final content, I would assume that if you have a VP of Design, that&#x27;s the person.

For a business model to survive you need to extract something from the end user eventually. With ads there is this turtle stacking problem - revenue comes from a consumer buying something from a retailer > retailer pays for ads on a website.<p>So at the end of the day there is an exchange of money, just not between the content producer and the consumer. If the desire is to kill the relationship between content and ads then the content needs to capture the revenue through another means - sales of hardcover books (internal ads), subscription services etc... there really aren&#x27;t that many models.<p>Publishers are already very available, and sharing exists. Different channels for paying authors don&#x27;t.",1437066728

Rich people, in general, are not sitting on piles of cash or extremely liquid assets that could simply be &quot;taken&quot; from them with no impact on anyone else. Taking away businesses, taking away capital, taking away their ability to capitalize on the human networks they&#x27;ve formed in some industry turns out to hurt the body politic as well. It&#x27;s why none of the large-scale efforts to confiscate wealth that have happened in the real world (most recently Venezuela for one example) ever seem to be going so well five or ten years later, once the first party has ended... removing capital from the people who know how to utilize it is not exactly a great deal for society.<p>Yes, &quot;rich&quot; people can get there &quot;unfairly&quot;, but it turns out &quot;just take it from them&quot; is really a stupid idea.<p>So as to not fit too clearly into a &quot;capitalist&quot; mold, note this line of argumentation argues that such rich people shouldn&#x27;t be able to simply pass this wealth down to their children, unless perhaps their children demonstrate similar facility with using it to their and society&#x27;s mutual benefit.

9898428,comment,9896689,9898107,0,0,jerf,,,"Every last one of your points <i>COMPLETELY</i> applies to C++ -> ASM. It&#x27;s not even like I&#x27;m stretching, except maybe on 4, but even then it&#x27;s only because the tradeoffs are so poor when the compiler is big and complicated. I read about 3 blog posts a month that dig into the actual ASM generated by some C or C++ code (security analysis, mostly, but sometime compiler bug/CPU bug/surprising behavior discussions). Plenty of other compiler output gets picked up as the final maintained output.<p>This raises a minor design concern in the serialization of the final AST to some sort of big deal... but that&#x27;s no different than optimizing your compile for space vs. time vs. compile time vs. correctness vs. any of the dozens of other dimensions you may have to optimize on. We don&#x27;t run around giving them all names. It would be crazy. For instance, you&#x27;re <i>always</i> worried about the mapping of the source to the target language... that&#x27;s hardly special to Coffeescript. How could you possibly create a <i>good</i> compiler without thinking about that?<p>In the meantime, the cognitive damage of people thinking these are somehow different skillsets is bad. Compilers are mystical enough to people without making up a brand new category of thing to confuse them about.<p>Go learn compilers, people. You&#x27;ll find you&#x27;ve automatically learned how to write transpilers too, without a single additional lesson. I can&#x27;t think of a much better proof than that that they aren&#x27;t actually different.",1437066260

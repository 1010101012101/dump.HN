8194953,comment,8193869,8194705,3,0,vacri,,,"It seems to me that you agree with Swizec. &#x27;Great Dragon&#x27; sounds just like &#x27;Great Dane&#x27; when you put other adjectives. Certainly to my mind it sounds like it&#x27;s a particular species of dragon. Given that the only place green-coloured dragons live is in fantasy (the komodo isn&#x27;t green), there&#x27;s pretty free reign to interpret it.<p>And in the context of animals, it&#x27;s particularly unusual to use the adjective &#x27;great&#x27; by itself, without it being part of the breed name. &#x27;Great big&#x27; maybe, but rarely just &#x27;great&#x27;. If you saw a large bulldog, it would sound strange to call it a &#x27;great bulldog&#x27; instead of a &#x27;great big bulldog&#x27; or other adjective.<p>This being said, because of their most prominent colour, we can talk about &quot;gray great white sharks&quot;, and get the colour in on both sides :)",1408399142

As a Developer though, I&#x27;m left with a bit of anxiety after reading this.<p>I think that part of the reason the top 50 E-Commerce sites haven&#x27;t implemented these features is due to the fact that their impact may not have been demonstrated enough, and articles like this will certainly help address that and bring more attention towards solving them.<p>The other part of the reason is that these behaviors are difficult to build (IMHO). I admittedly haven&#x27;t done much research on how to implement complex search features like these, but I bet that the amount of information regarding best practice or established patterns for these search types is lacking.  Without that information, the skill level required to design them is relatively high.<p>I&#x27;d love to implement these features in my apps, I feel the frustration of the users. But what I&#x27;d love to see now is an article or blog post in response to this that pairs each issue or desired behavior with a pattern or solution.<p>Making the problem visible is taken care of now, but the development community needs to come up with and/or share the solutions.",1408398997

8194937,comment,8194239,8194819,1,0,zackbloom,,,"1) One simple reason is if you&#x27;re one of the millions of website owners who is not technical enough to install it manually.  We hope to have the ability to go one step further for example and select from a set of themes to make it even easier to make a beautiful site.<p>Another reason which relates to #4 is to make it easier to update versions in the future.  We hope to build ways of testing those version changes to make version updates something better than the dredded task they are now.<p>Beyond that, when we chose the apps for our launch, part of the decision was based on showing variety and proving out the power of the system (“See, you can do CSS libraries, too!”).  The plan is for anything which can be on a site to be in Eager.<p>2) Very good question. If you log in to the system, we show you the source (<a href=""http://oi60.tinypic.com/21kjn6c.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oi60.tinypic.com/21kjn6c.jpg</a>).<p>In addition to the source, we’ll show you the version (if in say, the case of jQuery), there’s more than one [1].<p>One of the great benefits of client-side code is that all the cards are on the table.  Anyone is able to inspect the content of what we deliver.  We hope that by choosing Eager, you gain safety, by having access to an ecosystem of validated apps.<p>3) Yes! After creating an account [2], you&#x27;ll be able to view the developer dashboard [3] which includes a button to create an app.  You can create an app from any GitHub, Bitbucket, Launchpad, or Google Code project.  Just provide the URL and your tagged versions will be ready for import.<p>All apps come from specific tagged releases of public projects, meaning you can&#x27;t just paste some malicious code into our UI.<p>Right now we manually verify apps through a moderation process.  We are experimenting with techniques that will hopefully allow app developers to specify what permissions they require (similar to Chrome Apps), and for us to validate those permissions in an automated way.<p>4) No, when you install the app you can choose which version you&#x27;d like to install (or we choose the latest version for you if that&#x27;s the only one the app creator has made available). You are locked to that version until you decide to change it. We never change your bundle (the files delivered to your site) without your specific intervention.<p>[1] <a href=""https://eager.io/app/vP1PnpNHAG3j/install"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eager.io/app/vP1PnpNHAG3j/install</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://eager.io/signup?developer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eager.io/signup?developer</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://eager.io/developer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eager.io/developer</a>",1408398947

8194934,comment,8193583,8194760,1,0,depoll,,,"Another important aspect of properties in C# is that they are a target for metadata (i.e. Attributes).  This is something that&#x27;s frustratingly broken with the method getter/setter approach.  And while you can fix it by convention (e.g. a priority list for lookup on the getter, then setter, if those exist), it ends up being inconsistent and unnecessarily painful.<p>Consistency of access in Java is also really problematic for the same reason.  Which pair of getter/setter methods represents a reified property?  This is often done by naming convention, that&#x27;s usually, but not always consistent (getFoo/setFoo is common, but there&#x27;s also isFoo/setFoo, isFoo/setIsFoo, foo()/foo(value), etc.).  Worse (and this is something both Android&#x27;s flavor of Java SDK and Objective-C have fallen prey to), not all properties are written symmetrically (e.g. getText() and the various setText() methods on an EditText in Android, although there are some where all of the setters are subclasses of the only getter -- even worse).",1408398914

The article touches on this with the infinite humans / transhuman stuff at the end.<p>The argument assumes exponential growth in number of humans until the terminal state, but this is not a foregone conclusion.  While this doesn&#x27;t change the reasoning in a strict sense, it may put the &quot;soon&quot; cutoff millions of years in the future.<p>Finally, the prior probability is chosen arbitrarily.  It does matter quite a bit.  Take the exponential argument for evidence as to why:  For any given probabilty p that doomsday will occur on a given day, it is more likely today than on any single other day!  This is simply because if doomsday occurs today, it cannot occur on any future day, making it less likely on each successive day.<p>Except that if p=1E-10, doomsday is fantastically unlikely to occur this year.

A second reflection you could make is to consider, of people who enter the room, what the fraction is of people who ever get out. Let&#x27;s say that it ends at 1,000. Then, 110 people get out and 1,000 die. If it ends at 10,000, then 1,110 people get out and 10,000 die. In either case, about 8/9 of the people who ever go into the room will die.<p>But it&#x27;s not really a problem.\nIf you flip a coin, then 10 coins, then 100 coins and continue until you get all heads then vast majority of flipped coins will be heads while still any particular coin have 1/2 probability of landing heads. There just isn&#x27;t any paradox or even anything surprising.  \nSimilarly here it&#x27;s in my opinion obvious that chances of dying are 1/36 and they are the same for all people in the situation.

But they didn&#x27;t <i>illegally</i> overstay. They simply worked in Germany long enough to became German nationals. Partly, because in the EU (formerly European Community), the concept of a long-term &quot;guest&quot; with no rights is just not recognized: if someone lives in your country for <i>years</i> at your invitation, is able to support themselves and not engaged in criminality, and has learned some language/civics basics, they have a right to apply for permanent residency after some period.<p>I don&#x27;t think I support the concept of a long-term &quot;guest&quot; with no rights, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wrong that such rights exist.

Monads allow you to do two things:<p>1) Lift regular values into monadic ones in a generic way. Let&#x27;s say that we have two Monads - Optional and List. There should be a way such that we can take a non-monadic value (the part that will go inside) and turn it into a Monad. So, assuming Monad is a Java-like abstract class, the following should be possible:<p><pre><code>    Monad<String> m1 = Optional.lift(&quot;hello&quot;);\n    Monad<String> m2 = List.lift(&quot;hello&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n2) Flat-map, typically called bind in this context. Given a monad and a function that takes a value and returns a monad, we should have some way of combining the resulting monads if we were to map this function over the first monad&#x27;s internal value. So for instance, given an optional string, and a function that takes a string and returns an optional int, we should have some way of combining the Optional<Optional<Integer>> into just an Optional<Integer>. So, in the following contrived example...<p><pre><code>  // Returns a UTF8 string value from a database, may fail\n  public Optional<String> getUtf8Name() { ... }\n\n  // Returns the length of a String if it contains exclusively ascii characters\n  public Optional<Integer> getAsciiLength(String str) { ... }\n</code></pre>\n... you can compare the differences between it and the Functor&#x27;s map:<p><pre><code>  Optional<Integer> asciiLength = getUtf8Name().bind(getAsciiLength);\n  Optional<Integer> otherAsciiLength = getUtf8Name().map(getAsciiLength).getOrElse(Optional.absent());\n</code></pre>\nAs it turns out, you can implement the Functor&#x27;s map method in a generic way using lift and bind.<p><pre><code>  public abstract class Monad<A> implements Functor<A> {\n\n    /**\n     * Implements Functor&#x27;s map method.\n     */\n    @Override\n    public <B> Monad<B> map(Function<A, B> fn) {\n      return this.bind( innerValue -> this.lift(fn.apply(innerValue)) );\n    }\n\n  }</code></pre>",1408397300

That is, deployment and service orchestration is a nightmare.<p>I recently experimented with a micro service architecture using Flask, but after wasting time trying to figure out how to properly deploy and orchestrate all the services (especially when running tests), I reverted to a simple backend/frontend model. It&#x27;s still technically a &quot;microservice&quot; architecture, but the &quot;services&quot; are an API and the web-app. They&#x27;re ~1000 lines instead of 100.<p>I get the sense that this kind of architecture is over optimization for a lot of projects. Martin Fowler himself describes it as an &quot;architecture for <i>monolithic</i> applications.&quot; I suspect that for smaller applications, where services are not spread across multiple departments and locations, a microservice architecture is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth. The deployment is simply too much of a headache (again, especially for testing). You&#x27;re moving all of your maintenance work from maintaining one big service to maintaining the orchestration and deployment of dozens of small ones.<p>Again, I really like the idea behind this kind of architecture. But I had a lot of trouble with a solid deployment and orchestration mechanism. I want to be able to be able run tests quickly.

Maybe a teacher would put a wiggly line under wrongly ordered adjectives, but it wouldn’t actually be a serious mistake, just a weird stylistic choice?<p>Also, it’s entirely possible I actually was taught about adjective order, but have forgotten all about it. If you learn English for nine years (with either four or five lessons per week) you do lots of reading and writing, especially during the later years, actual texts from the real world and actual essays. It‘s very possible I picked it up through that and it was never necessary to explicitly teach me about adjective order.",1408396412

I learned about adjective order differences between languages way back in the 1970s when I took my first course in linguistics. These differences can be quite striking between noncognate languages like English and Chinese. Both in English and in Chinese, most grammatical relationships in sentences are communicated by word order rather than by inflection of words. But the word order rules can differ, particularly in the order of demonstrative versus possessive modifiers of nouns (what we call &quot;adjectives&quot; in English). In English, it is very anomalous to say * &quot;my that book,&quot; as the standard word order would be &quot;that book of mine,&quot; but in Chinese it is expected to say, &quot;我的那本書,&quot; which corresponds to the anomalous word order in English. And so on for most phrases like those contrasted between English and Chinese. One thing that gives native speakers of Chinese an &quot;accent&quot; in English, besides phonology, is grammar differences like that, and of course the same is true when a native speaker of English speaks Chinese as a second language.",1408396253

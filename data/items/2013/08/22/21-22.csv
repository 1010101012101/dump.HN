Rational choice theory is a deeply and fundamentally flawed model to start with, but its a tolerable approximation of behavior in lots of important cases (mostly, classes of products which are frequently purchased and used and whose utilities are very clear upon use, allowing any misperceptions about expected utility to be resolved so that most purchase decisions are in fact made with reasonably strong information about costs and utilities.)<p>Look, the rest of the developed world does as good or better (by most measures) healthcare than the US at <i>vastly</i> lower cost (whether measured per capita or per GDP), and they don&#x27;t do it by making patient pay directly for services.

Which makes sense, as security is a huge, incredibly competitive industry, and these people are all competing for the world&#x27;s paranoia dollars.<p>Putting aside the merit of the idea of that the government bidding process ends with purchase of the best product, it&#x27;s worth noting that just like with the government agents, the manufacturer isn&#x27;t actually liable to anyone who suffers when its machines produce a false positive. Insofar as the manufacturer has any incentive to improve in this regard, its incentive comes from the same people who are putting on this security theater.<p>> Because the TSA gained nothing wasting their time on this. [blah blah] What did the TSA, NYPD, FBI, and whoever else gain from this giant waste of time?<p>Not sure why you threw this in here but it&#x27;s so wrong that it&#x27;s kind of hard to know where to begin. First, the superficial and obvious: TSA and NYPD are paid overtime. They had MONEY to gain from this exercise. Their financial incentives are exactly opposed to those of the person they are detaining.<p>Less superficial, perhaps equally obvious: a bureaucracy does stuff because that&#x27;s the stuff the bureaucracy does. It&#x27;s a big, mindless machine whose prime directive is to continue to exist. Everyone understands that they need to be seen to be DOING SOMETHING, and there are plenty of true believers who think doing that something is the most important thing in the world.

The wide range of colors that you can get in stained glass is due to the nano properties of the materials you add to the glass. The effect is due to surface plasmons - electric field waves that travel on the surface of conductors. Much like ocean waves, plasmons are created from light&#x27;s electric field. They bounce back and forth, and since they are only permitted on the surface of a material, there are limits on what waves can exist. This is what gives them the weird properties - the size and shape determine the optical properties.<p>On another tangent (this one&#x27;s pretty cool) - since you can tune the properties of these nanoparticles, you can make them respond in a specific way. Let&#x27;s say we have a cancer cell that we want to kill, and only that cancer cell should die. We can create nanoparticles that bond with that cancer cell, and only that cancer cell. But how do we kill it? We can tune the absorption spectrum of the nanoparticle to absorb infrared light - light that is transparent to the human body. We create a small heater that absorbs tons of the input energy, while keeping the rest of the area cool. Localized heating destroys the nearby cancer cell.<p>Plasmonics are really cool - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmon</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmonic_Nanoparticles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmonic_Nanoparticles</a>",1377206788

The FBI agent&#x27;s admission to having profiled the OP seem to be just that; I&#x27;m not sure how it could have been a ruse to get him to admit something. If we believe the story, it constitutes strong evidence that he was being profiled, and <i>we</i> should certainly see it that way and be outraged accordingly.<p>In terms of courts, I&#x27;m not sure what context we&#x27;re talking about, since there are no courts involved. IANAL, but if the OP were to sue, rules about testimonial hearsay don&#x27;t apply because it would be a civil case, not a criminal one. Even if it were criminal (if the OP had been arrested and was mounting a defense or the FBI agent was, I guess, arrested?), it&#x27;s not obvious to me that the agent&#x27;s statement qualifies, since its purpose has to be to assist the investigation. And finally, the rule that police are allowed to lie to get you to confess (as in your example) is actually separate from whether it&#x27;s testimonial or not, and simply hinges on whether it&#x27;s coercive. If I understand it, the testimonial hearsay rule as applied to cops lying is for when the cop says, &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s no problem; I make bombs at home too&quot; in that it doesn&#x27;t allow the defense to say, &quot;see that cop makes bombs!&quot; So that&#x27;s all to say I don&#x27;t understand what all that has to do with whether the OP was being profiled or not. Possibly I misunderstood something or have my legal facts wrong, though; can you clarify?<p>Edit to add: but regardless, it shouldn&#x27;t change how much we&#x27;re outraged at home, assuming we believe the OP&#x27;s story, which I certainly do.",1377206131

Bush administration. Remember the very warm welcome Obama had when visiting Europe just before the inauguration (for example in Berlin)? This was really an expression of the wish to get back to terms as they used to be and to close the books over what seemed then to have been just an episode. Or take Obama&#x27;s (quite premature) Nobel price as an example for yet another expression of this wish.<p>In the meantime things have changed. But it wasn&#x27;t the change expected. From outside, it looks a bit like the US became out of balance. When naming the State department and other arms headed towards foreign policy, not much of them is perceived outside. (I really can&#x27;t remember when the US State department was in the news last time, but it feels like to have been years ago.) What&#x27;s perceived, is the intelligence, the DoD, drones, the NSA, etc. From outside it appears, as if the US with a self-description as the &quot;blessed nation&quot; has lost interest in co-operation on a large scale as it even targets its closest allies. What had been the epicenter of freedom, cool, and hip, now has started to feel a bit like a looming shadow. (It might be worth to note here that most political parties in Europe have their origins in the revolutions of 1848, which were essentially a revolt against surveillance and police control. Even in the social network age there are some of these values still alive and are nurturing some sensibility on this subject.) There&#x27;s even saying of the cold war returning, but this time with the US featuring the bad guy. This is not, what the allies of the US have learned to expect from their partner. Nor is it, what its friends would wish them to be. This is not, how people would like to perceive the US, but eventually they start feeling being unable to help about it. There&#x27;s a feeling of disappointment. And there&#x27;s a great wish for co-operation and trust.",1377206008

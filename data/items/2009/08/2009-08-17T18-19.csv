Some of my time in this life has been priceless and I wouldn't give it up for anything. Much of it turns out to be near useless, on the other hand.<p>I make ~$12/hr right now, but I'm into what I'm doing (that is, I think it'll generate some of those priceless moments eventually). But given that I'd like to have more money (it may even end up saving me some time!) if you have $30/hr for me you can have a bunch of my time.<p>That's probably a more philosophical answer than you were hoping for.

AT&T was a giant turd that everyone hated 2 years ago, just like it is now. If anything it's gotten far better in that time, and the iPhone has racked up serious sales. It wouldn't surprise me if both parties are very happy with their relationship, and AT&T willing to concede even more for exclusivity.<p>They did it because they thought they'd make more money that way, and maybe they did, and maybe they still will. Maybe they knew they'd sell 1/2 as many phones that way, but make 3x more per phone and therefore come out ahead, and maybe that math hasn't changed. Certainly AT&T will cling to the iPhone the way the Cavaliers will to LeBron.<p>Verizon doesn't need Apple. They'll steamroll AT&T with turds like the Blackberry Storm if they have to because they're far and away the best network in the U.S. and everybody loves them. Apple needs Verizon far more though, which means they won't get anywhere near the deal there they will from AT&T in terms of money, control, etc.<p>So if I had to bet (with someone who doesn't have insider info of course) I'd say we see continued exclusivity with AT&T.

To ""save an hour"" means different things to these people.<p>Time can even be a bit of a paradox.  If you make a task 1000 hours faster, you don't necessarily ""save"" 1000 hours of free time, due to multi-tasking.  Consider a small, repetitive task.

You Google, and a handful of web sites pop up that offer promising solutions. But obviously you don't believe anything you read from vendors, so you check for online reviews. Then you wonder if the favorable reviews are planted by the vendor, and the bad reviews are planted by his competitors. Can you trust reviews from anonymous strangers?<p>You ask your coworkers and friends if they have ever used the product that you're interested in, and no one has. What now?<p>Shopping is broken.<p>How much more stimulated would the economy be if the people who have money, and are willing to spend it, could be reliably connected with the products that they desire?<p>What the world really needs is some way to connect you with the people who already use the sorts of products you want, and are willing to answer an e-mail or two about the topic.<p>About a year ago I had surgery to fix my voice. The information on the Internet about that particular surgery was outdated and didn't address my questions. The only way I could become a consumer of that surgery was by communicating directly with people who already had it, which I did. And since then I have answered questions for dozens of people who have the same questions that I had.<p>Likewise, as my wife and I make a zillion decisions for the home we are building, we prefer products and solutions used by people that we have spoken to personally. The Internet is virtually useless for any of the hundreds of product decisions we have made so far.<p>And what about choosing a destination for a vacation? You're much more comfortable if you have spoken to someone who visited the same place.<p>The obvious problem with connecting past consumers with potential consumers is that while people are generally helpful by nature, no one wants a million e-mails asking how they like their new can opener. So how do you strike the right balance?<p>Imagine a system that works like this: When you buy a product, you agree in advance to answer up to four e-mails from future potential customers, beginning no sooner than one year from when you make your purchase. It's totally optional, but agreeing gives you access to people who already bought the product you're considering today, to help you make your own decision. It would strike you as a fair deal.<p>For privacy reasons, this imagined system would disguise your e-mail address. And the system would have to be administered by some third party, not the vendor selling the product, or you wouldn't trust the strangers giving you advice.<p>Maybe you have a better idea for fixing shopping.""<p>From: <a href=""http://www.dilbert.com/blog/entry/shopping_is_broken/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dilbert.com/blog/entry/shopping_is_broken/</a>",1250535028

If I want to things to interact in software, I just say so and it is done.<p>And <i>that</i> is what gives programming language designers the freedom to do a much better job.

768756,comment,768528,768528,0,0,Dove,,,"This is excellent advice.  I constantly experiment when writing code.  It is one of the main reasons that I'm such a fan of using a scripting language like Perl to shake out an algorithm before committing it to whatever language I'm really working in.<p>I particularly agree with the comment about rewriting code.  I typically force myself to re-type the solution at the end of an experiment (or I'm forced to by the fact that it's two different languages), resulting in clearer expression, better comments, and just generally cleaner results.  The reason is that the second time through, I can focus on <i>presenting</i> the solution rather than <i>finding</i> it.  (Moreover, it is not that uncommon to find bugs in the process of thinking about how to make it most apparent to the reader that the code is correct). I am of the opinion that rewriting an essay or a piece of code almost always improves it, and in some cases this is a sound investment.<p>One advantage the OP doesn't really discuss is that the short dev cycle encourages you to more fully characterize the behavior of what you've written.  When plugging a solution into the larger app, it's tempting to say, ""huh, looks like it works,"" and move on.  But if you've got it isolated and under the glass, you can poke it a bit.  Call it in funny ways, give it unusual inputs, think about how robust it needs to be.  It doesn't really take long -- a few minutes, maybe, if you've got the framework already set up -- and it cuts down immensely on subtle bugs.  Confidence that you understand how important sections of the code work is an immense boon, and can result in weird long stretches of simply . . . writing things that you know are correct.<p>Overall, I agree wholeheartedly with experimenting.  I think it is a faster way to work that also produces significantly higher quality results.  Just don't get carried away -- like comments, you should only indulge when it's useful to dispel uncertainty.",1250534386

Note that iPhone can do this transition smoothly, and applications can <i>still</i> pick up new resources, UI layouts, etc.<p>... at the end of the day there are a few rules of thumb I think:<p>- Users care far more about the fit and finish of your software than they do about its strict functionality - i.e. you can get away with lacking functionality, but nobody will forgive you for poor UX.<p>- Users don't really care if ""there's an app for that"" when it comes to what they consider to be basic functionality. Include the basic goodies (PDF reader for example, music sync software for example) with the box or your users will walk, regardless of how much you point at the app store.<p>This is the gist of the article I think. Android is a capable platform, but so far nobody has gone over with a fine toothed comb like Apple has and gotten rid of all of the little annoying bits.",1250534217

If you go to any lab, they'll tell you they're trying to come up with an accurate model, or trying to create structures with a certain known function. Your name for the process & opinions about it are irrelevant. It should be empirically clear what is happening.<p>I can't make sense of any of that, or see how it is relevant to what you were quoting from my post. Are you suggesting that logical positivism is correct, or that  it's ok for scientists (and for you) to ignore the philosophy of science, or something else? Vague references to ""trying to create structures with a certain known function"" are just impossible for me to interpret without some explanation of what they're supposed to mean.<p>>We did chemistry for a long time without an atomic theory, just memorizing which chemicals should be mixed with which. Of course it was rudimentary, but there wasn't a way around that.<p>Again, this seems completely irrelevant to the statement you've quoted. You're confusing a knowledge of how a method works with a knowledge of how chemical reactions work. The chemists methods were (typically) scientific and rational, even though they did not reach a good understanding of chemistry using these methods for quite some time. You seem to be saying that deciding between theories by a coin toss would be scientific if it turned out to be effective (which it might, in principle). But surely effectiveness is not the only criterion we apply. We also require the methods used to be in some sense rational, although (as you would discover if you bothered to read the philosophy of science instead of sneering at it), it is very difficult to figure out exactly what this means.<p>>They are statements about what people think people should do.<p>I don't agree, I think they are simply statements about what people should do. Certainly, if our brains were different we might have different moral beliefs, but that does not imply that those beliefs would be equally correct. (One can imagine a scenario in which everyone has brains which cause them to think that squares are circles, but that wouldn't imply that facts about geometry are merely facts about a consensus of human thought.) I'm not sure what you mean when you say ""this is also empirically true."" Are you suggesting that it has somehow been /empirically/ established that moral statements are statements about what people think people should do? I don't see which empirical facts about the brain could adjudicate between different positions regarding the nature of moral statements. I am curious, though, why you are so sure that moral facts must be reducible to physical facts. There is no reason whatever to think that this is the case (and though you persistently assert that is is, you never bother to provide any), but this idea really seems to have captured your imagination.",1250533490

768693,comment,767971,768588,0,0,ErrantX,,,"> Do you use an alarm clock to wake up? If so, are you sure you're not sleep-deprived?<p>Originally for a few months to train me into it. Now I wake up automatically at a few minutes to 7 :)<p>I never slept much before anyway - 7 hours is the best I have slept for years. I cant physically sleep for more than 8-9 hours (I will always wake up - tried it :))<p>Weekends I wake up at 8-9am (I make that a bit flexible; basically just rely on my body to wake me up when it feels like it) and the lie in is a great ""weekend feeling"" boost (part of feeling a lot more positive).<p>> What do you eat for breakfast? I'm usually hungry within 2-3 hours after eating cereal, oatmeal, or a banana.<p>Cereal. Then either a bacon sandwich, or a boiled egg or a bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon. I eat a BIG breakfast and lunch but a small tea.<p>> Where do domestic tasks fit in? Weekends only? I can't cook, eat, and do dishes in half an hour, and if you're cooking fresh vegetables, waiting a week between grocery trips seems to be suboptimal.<p>I do have a slight confession here: in that I live at home (an annoyingly necessary arrangement for the time being) so my family shares the cooking. I cook maybe twice a week and those are my 10hr days. Chores I do in the morning before work - im less than 10 minutes walk away so I basically have 2hrs for ""doing stuff"" in the mornings. Other domestic chores give me my breaks<p>I pick up fresh veg on my way home every few nights (and because I only live 10 mins away I have an hr to get home, do chores and chill till I start to work again).<p>Actually the last few weeks i have been slipping. Prior to last week I spent a month on standard 8 hour days and (unusually for me) a lot of time in bed due to a tooth and ear infection. It's been really useful to find I can get back into my rythm really quickly again :D The onyl downside is I felt awful those few weeks of illness - more so than I should have. I think I was actually ""crashing"" because of being out of the routine (a doctor friend has confirmed this is something he has seen before) so some of the caveats as with the drugs apply! I suspect my recovery was extended substantially because of feeling like I did. Which is something interesting I need to explore.",1250532398

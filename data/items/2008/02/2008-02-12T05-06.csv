113830,comment,113779,113779,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I know this isn't the case at my Architecture firm.  When we do get paper in the office (snail mail, etc), we scan it (pdf) into our system and put the original in a box in sequential order for easy retrieval later if we need it.  That is the last time the original usually sees the light of day.  We typically work with pdf files with clients for invoicing and for presentations.  In the past we'd have sent out prints, now a pdf file is all we need.  The main time we are forced to use actual paper is to comply with government regulations and permitting etc.  But effectively, we are paperless and radically more efficient because of it.

Even though that is only a 2 fps difference.<p>A 400% performance gain is a constant performance improvement. I don't think a system like nginx + memcached have linear performance benefits in the first place.",1202794049

113818,comment,113720,113720,0,0,ironwill,,,"The discussion here goes to show how valuations are still stretched. In any ""normal"" times (i.e exclude late 90's bubble and the mini-bubblet of the last couple of years), valuations like 3-4x revenue would be considered perfectly reasonable, for a relatively mature yet risky play like this (risk because the audience could get bored and leave, as seems to be already happening).<p>After a prolonged downturn (Japan anyone?) we wouldn't be arguing whether 3-4x revenue is too low. We would be surprised any deal at all got done.",1202793009

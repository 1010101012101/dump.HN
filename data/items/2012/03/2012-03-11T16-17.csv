It is literally, the prisoner's dilemma.<p>- Absent posting bail, you stay in jail until you go to trial (which can be a long time in a scenario where everyone is in fact going to trial).  The ""excessive bail"" clause of the 8th Amendment, in practice, has been eviscerated.  Bail is routinely set so high that the only way it is affordable is to pay a bondsman.  This means that it's easy to punish people prior to a trial for exercising their rights.  A stay in jail prior to trial can be as or more destructive than being convicted - you likely lose your job, your housing, possibly custody of your children, all without any process.<p>The judicial system has ~ a thousand years practice at maintaining control and getting the outcomes (overall) that the State desires.  It is not a simple matter to ""force"" it to do anything.",1331485005

3690627,story,,,59,39,pbj,"Tell HN: Steal my ideas",,"I've got a few ideas and I'm not sure if they'll ever see the light of day. I'm happy to share them with HN in the hopes that you work on them or they help give you other ideas. Some may already exist, and if so, I apologize!<p>Idea #1) A scholarship service/site that doesn't suck<p>You'd think finding scholarships wouldn't be that hard, but you're in for a surprise. My wife is fixing to start graduate studies and I've been pouring over scholarship/fellowship sites for her. I've spent countless hours just looking for ones for her to apply to, and I've visited 20+ scholarship search engines.<p>They're filled to the brim with scam/""you could win $100,000! sweepstakes"" type scholarships. They also have tons of extra offers from paid for profit universities. Lastly, they display scholarships that she isn't even qualified for, despite narrowing the filters to ones that she is supposed to be qualified for.<p>I've found different scholarships on each site, so there's not even a single site that has all of the same scholarships on it. I'm starting to wish at this point that there was a paid service that someone could just pay $X for. They'd research for you and send you back a huge list of scholarships that were tailored just for you.<p>For that matter, you'd think there would be a better service out there that would research anything like that. Kind of like Google Answers/MTurk, only for in depth things. For example, maybe I'm interested in opening a bakery and I want someone to do the research for me for all the competitors in the area, what they charge, what they have on the menu, the size of their bakeries, the available properties in the area, the legal requirements of opening a bakery and getting licensed in the city, etc.<p>Idea #2) An expat job site that actually helps you immigrate, aka overseas recruiters<p>I've flirted with the idea of immigrating elsewhere for a while now. But the sheer volume of things you'd have to do just to immigrate is mind boggling, not to mention different for every country. Some professions can help you get a green card in X country, but not Y, etc. I wish there was a site that would be designed for hopeful expats that would connect them with jobs from employers in other countries that hire foreign workers. The site could also guide you through the immigration process, kind of like Legalzoom does for creating a company.<p>Idea #3) Sortfolio for X<p>Sortfolio is a neat tool because it's a great way to browse web designers visually. There's lots of other things that could benefit from having this, like what about Web/Mobile app developers? Videographers? What about a way to browse local/regional bands for weddings/gigs?<p>Idea #4) SponsorMe<p>How many hours in a given week do you spend on Youtube? What about your friends? Tons of Youtube members easily have 10,000+ subscribers. It's true that they can choose to display ads on their videos, but what about cutting youtube out of the equation? If someone has a video series where they review phones, wouldn't it be neat to be able to reach out to the content creators directly and have them mention your app in their video, or wear your company TShirt? American Idol for instance does this with Coke cups drank by the judges (or at least they used to). Think about how much time they get of their product being on screen.<p>The site could basically be a marketplace that lists both youtube members who are willing to take on sponsorships and possibly their rates, as well as companies looking to advertise their products. You could browse by category to find the best people to partner with. The site doesn't have to stop at youtube, as there are also traditional bloggers out there that might be interested.<p>Idea #5) ""Beat Mine"" restaurant, aka the reddit restaurant<p>A brick and mortar concept for a restaurant. The restaurants menu is driven by the patrons. For example, let's say the restaurant offers a chocolate cake. You try it but you know your homemade chocolate cake is better. You submit the recipe and the restaurant offers it temporarily. If enough patrons vote for it, that chocolate cake takes the place as their chocolate cake. You could offer a tiny percentage of sales of that dish as commission to the recipe submitter. This would provide constant incentive to keep trying to top that item. But who knows, maybe people (and/or the kitchen staff) demand familiarity when they go to restaurants and this would be a horrible failure.",1331484467

Low value posts but high karma?  So I wasn't sure what ""avg:"" was if not post points.<p>But I believe it is post points.  So, for high ""karma,"" bully must post a LOT, but his posts are not well received (even though high ""karma"" would suggest otherwise).

Pulling up stumps and moving in search of work and prosperity has ALWAYS been risky (hell, I've done it three times so far, once while massively in debt).

And yet more and more people remain complacent in a 13% jobless rate area when 3.3% is available for the taking.<p>Of course, the good news is that for those who ARE adventurous, there's never been a better time to move and take advantage of the opportunities created by the fear of the majority.",1331484126

3690610,comment,3689478,3689478,2,0,tokenadult,,,"There are a lot of interesting comments here, and I especially appreciate the comments from people who know India (a place I have never been). The author of the submitted article says he grew up mostly in India and in Minnesota, the place where I was born, grew up, and now live. The article seems to suggest, with its anecdote<p>""She leads a simple life (impoverished even, by American standards), but she is immeasurably better off than she was a couple of decades ago. She grew up in a thatch hut. Now she lives in a house with a concrete roof, running water and electricity. Her son owns a cellphone and drives a motorcycle. Her niece is going to college.<p>""But not long before we talked, there had been a murder in the area, the latest in a series of violent attacks and killings. Shops that hadnt existed a decade ago were boarded up in anticipation of further violence; the police patrolled newly tarred roads.""<p>that crime will increase when ""Americanization"" happens to a society. I think that is a mistaken conclusion. I have lived overseas, for two three-years stays, in Taiwan, both before and after Taiwan's democratization. Reduction in crime seems to depend crucially on both effective law enforcement and on a civil society that builds cohesion and community norms against crime. Rapidly transforming societies--in whatever direction they are transforming--seem to suffer a breakdown of social order and an increase in crime rate. That's just what was happening in the United States as I grew up. But today crime rates in the United States are actually much lower, for nearly all types of crime, and especially for violent crime, than they were in my early adulthood. My Minnesota neighborhood and the whole large suburban municipality surrounding it is essentially crime-free, with almost the only life-threatening form of crime being driving while drunk. My whole family, including my young children, can walk or bicycle anywhere within more than a five-mile radius at any hour of day or night and have no fear of any kind of crime. I have urban habits formed in childhood of looking the door of our house every evening, but it's no worry if we ever leave the house without looking it up, and possessions like bicycles and skateboards and patio furniture can be left outdoors unattended for days on end with no one stealing them or damaging them.<p>More generally, in view of the many interesting comments here, I think India has a much brighter future from today than, say, China. India has a great many problems, according to every person from India I know, but India has a free press and moderately fair elections and a great deal of openness about talking about societal problems. China, by contrast, does not permit such open criticism of corruption, political favoritism, and police inaction against crime as is routine in India. Both because India has a government that must be accountable to voters and a free press to watch the government, and because people from India have access through the English language to the consequences of different political and economic systems around the world, I expect India to fix more of its problems more smoothly over the next few decades than China, and ultimately to be a leading example for countries around the world in how to build a cohesive, diverse, and thriving society with much freedom to choose the best of the traditional and modern.",1331483983

Hmm, just trying to reassess this myself: While playing with Clojure, I found I had to use the Java libraries for basic stuff like file i/o (at least that is what all the examples pointed me to). I'd have been much happier playing with native Clojure libraries for things like that as I found the syntax became really unLisp like. I'm hoping I missed something, and that there are in fact ways to avoid the Java libraries when you want to. In which case I'd agree that ""JVM is <i>just</i> Clojure's underlying implementation"" and might in fact take another stab at Clojure.",1331482692

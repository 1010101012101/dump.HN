There’s an ingenious shortcut, based on the observation that if Y is relatively prime to each of X1,X2,…,Xn, then it also has no factor in common with the product X1×X2×⋯×Xn. Thus it’s possible to detect the presence of shared factors with just n GCD operations, instead of n2.&quot;<p>Can someone explain that shortcut in more detail?",1382921884

Unless you replace the gasoline motor with a generator, having a gasoline engine still necessitates a lot of mechanical parts you can just drop if you have a pure EV. Transmission, exhaust, clutch, gas tank and a lot more. This increases both mechanical complexity (repairs) and cost.<p>Once battery tech gets sufficiently cheap, EVs will blow all the competition out of the water for personal vehicles. At most you&#x27;ll get EVs with a gasoline-fueled genset for refueling off the grid.

This happens three times, in dramatic fashion, in just the span of about 17 years.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t need more empirical evidence than that.<p>Fortunately we have a mountain of direct evidence to support my position.<p>Monetary policy being simple has nothing to do with its results. Cheap money doesn&#x27;t stay put, it chases returns.<p>Our supposed best macro policy is a disaster. It has neither contained price inflation, nor produced jobs. Quite the opposite in fact over the last two decades of high level Fed tampering with the economy. Said macro policy is not the best at all, it&#x27;s standard issue failed Keynesian policy (Japan has been enjoying a similar program for decades as their economy has rotted and accumulated hyper debt).<p>Not only has the Fed admitted it can create asset bubbles with low rate policies (both Greenspan and Bernanke have acknowledged such); not only has the Fed said that they want to spur asset inflation, to generate a wealth effect (they directly said their goal was to re-inflate housing for example); but the US Treasury and the Fed&#x27;s own governance board has also stepped forward to say that the Fed&#x27;s policies directly drive asset bubbles, including in the stock market. The Fed&#x27;s governance board recently warned that the Fed&#x27;s policies were creating potentially dangerous imbalances in asset prices; that was a year ago.<p>Then all the direct correlation data:<p>&quot;between January 2009 and April 2013, on days in which the Fed POMO was more than $5 billion, the stock market rose a total of 570 points, on days in which the POMO was less than $5 billion, the cumulative stock market gain was &quot;only&quot; 141 points, and when there was no POMO, the S&P gained... -51 points.&quot;<p>OR:<p>&quot;We show that since 1994, more than 80 percent of the equity premium on U.S. stocks has been earned over the twenty-four hours preceding scheduled Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcements (which occur only eight times a year)—a phenomenon we call the pre-FOMC announcement &#x27;drift.&#x27;&quot;<p>The data points are extraordinarily overwhelming in supporting the fact that the Fed&#x27;s policies directly drive the stock market. We have the logical (get rid of yield on cash, money has to chase risk), the empirical (the charts and data), and all of the players admitting it. We also have the perverse: watch CNBC on Fed announcement days.<p>If that doesn&#x27;t convince you, there&#x27;s nothing that can.",1382921527

Eclipse since we&#x27;re required to use it for Java, and LibreOffice for writing papers.

Arch has a reputation for being a lot of work, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s much less work to keep up-to-date then a Ubuntu install, at the very least Arch doesn&#x27;t have massive breaking updates every 6 months. I have yet to have my Arch system totally crap-out on me, as long as I update my packages every few days or so, and check the Arch News before any upgrades that may cause issues, it&#x27;s been extremely easy to maintain.",1382921391

The stock market, if anything, is forward looking.  Even if the fed was causing a bubble, the kind of patterns you are showing wouldn&#x27;t be expected.  Take the second link, for example.  The article clearly states that the stock price gains are made <i>before</i> the FOMC announcements.  So somehow the act of making any announcement is causing the market to react in anticipation.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to explain these patterns, but they are certainly not good evidence for the Fed causing a bubble.<p>Monetary policy is very simple and in accordance with the best macro theory we have.  The Fed lowers interest rates in recessions, in the hope that it will cause people to consume/invest more and &quot;save&quot; less where saving might include holding hard currency, or safe physical investments.  Put in more conventional language, the Fed lowers interest rates to stimulate economic activity.<p>But this should not be interpreted as trying to cause a bubble.  The aim of the Fed is to stimulate economic activity so that both the current efficiency of the economy improves, and beliefs about the future efficiency of the economy are more optimistic.  In doing so, it hopes to cause the economy to move from the &quot;unnatural&quot; state in which people are fearful about the future, expect high interest rates, and are unwilling to invest or consume, to the &quot;natural&quot; state in which people are optimistic about the future and expect low (short and medium term) interest rates.",1382920253

I was in a session just this week that showed a gene therapy cure for two kids who were cured of lysosomal storage disorder. It was incredible. But still an n of 4 I think. The process of growing the cells and transferring the genes is so time consuming and difficult, that&#x27;s the best they could do. That&#x27;s an extreme case to be sure, but even more mundane stuff can suffer. For example, if your study requires a muscle biopsy instead of a blood test, your n is going to be lower because muscle biopsies are a tough sell to patients.

I&#x27;m pretty sure there is a study somewhere about the long-term impact of web-based ads compared to billboards and TV ads, and I&#x27;m pretty sure that study would say that the long-term impact of web-ads would be much lower than TV ads, and basically forgotten in 5 minutes, and if not so soon, probably vaporized within a week.<p>The problem became too much when advertisers and webmasters decided to use other means to gain my attention. An ad in the corner of the page is no big deal. When the page starts to look like a Nascar event with no meaningful content, this is irritating. Since this apparently wasn&#x27;t in-your-face enough, they added in pop-ups, scrolling ads, and most confoundedly, ads that talked. I listen to music when I am browsing, and I can&#x27;t describe how disrespectful this is to me. I sometimes browse with my computer muted, but some of these ads have figured out how to turn my volume on! This is no longer an symbiotic relationship between buyer and seller, but a one-sided fuck you. This is in plain terms, abuse, and it is wrong and these assholes don&#x27;t deserve a dime from my clicks or my views.<p>But the problem gets worse because showing me ads is no longer good enough. Now I have a few thousand companies tracking my every move. I dealt with slow-loading sites via iframes and gigs of cookies on my computer. So now, I turn on Disconnect or Ghostery.<p>I used to earn money from ad revenue on my sites, and I am going to put ads up on my current sites. It would be foolish for me to depend solely on ad revenue, and I certainly don&#x27;t hold any ill-will toward people using ad-block, so I would have to think of other ways to monetize my content.

It did not happen. There are credible observers and market participants who not only believe that tapering is <i>not</i> coming any time soon but that the Fed&#x27;s asset purchases will actually increase.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily agree, but I do believe that the Fed has positioned itself between a rock and a hard place, so I personally wouldn&#x27;t make too many assumptions about timing and magnitude of increases or decreases in asset purchases.<p>> So yes, the market will discount investments that pay off in 1-2 years at a low interest rate. But since the low interest rates aren&#x27;t expected to last, we shouldn&#x27;t expect huge price increases for stocks whose investments will pay off in 5-10 years.<p>You make the mistake of assuming that investors are entirely rational. The empirical evidence clearly demonstrates that this is not the case. You should also consider that many (and perhaps the majority) of the participants in a good number of markets aren&#x27;t really &quot;investors&quot; as most people define the term.<p>John Williams, the President of the SF Fed, recently addressed asset price bubbles in a presentation[1]. It is well worth a read, and I would point you to the following:<p>&quot;For monetary policy, one implication of theories with endogenous asset price bubbles is that the time horizon over which policy affects the economy may be longer than typically thought. In particular, the policy response to cyclical movements in economic activity and inflation may have effects on investor beliefs and the behavior of asset prices that reach well into the future.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.frbsf.org/our-district/press/presidents-speeches/williams-speeches/2013/september/asset-price-bubbles-tomorrow-yesterday-never-today/Bubbles-Tomorrow-and-Bubbles-Yesterday-but-Never-Bubbles-Today.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frbsf.org/our-district/press/presidents-speeches/...</a>",1382919463

6624316,comment,6622394,6624162,1,0,001sky,,,"At the risk of cross-threading the discussion, you need to account for 2nd and 3rd order impacts when trying to figure out where supply and demand will reach equilibrium. In particular, r->0 (asymptotically) is problematic because of somewhat opaque issues with DCF pricing. In particular, R(r) where R is the market discount rate and (r) is the risk free rate. Lets assume the fed is manipulating (r) and that R(r) is directionaly (+). That is fair enough. But R is also impacted by exogenous preferences setting (for risk, weath effects, substitution effects). While these preferences may be stable in theory at &quot;normal r&quot; (~econ 101 assumption), they are empirically not <i>independent</i> of (r) as r-->0 and so are not stable <i>at all</i> in our test case. In fact, as (r)-->0, it becomes more and more rational to take on extreme risk (especially so if (r) is temporarily/ artifically low. After all, you are playing with &quot;free money&quot;. Now, lets assume that you have shifted gears in this way. Lets further assume you have a choice of two investment classes: (a) Low risk and (b) High Risk. Its clear you will weight your portfolio towards (b), purely through the change in preferences. This change in <preferences> will change R(r) and show up in your DCFs (ie, when implied by market pricing). In other words, the only way &#x27;DCF&#x27; will make sense is when you plug in R&#x27;(r)=|=R(r). But now lets consider the subset of (b) in isolation. Given the result above, R&#x27;->0, stocks that have non-transparent, distant income will become relatively more attractive. That is to say, the current prices will look too low. So, you will overweight these stocks (bidding up prices). But not only will you in general bid up <i>all assets</i> (due to little r) you will bid up disporportionately equity vs debt and furthermore non-transparent risk equity vs lower-risk equity.  As a result, you <should> <i>expect huge price increases for stocks whose investments will pay off in 5-10 years.</i><p>Or at least, so the theory goes.",1382919408

I&#x27;m just not buying it.<p>I think, that if the US made a political decision to give this monster - Osama - a chance for a free trial, as well as other Al Quaida members that would be a step in the right direction as far as winning the war goes. Because you play by your own rules. When opposite is being done, like killing children who are US citizens by Presidential Order just because their parent was a suspected terrorist killed a week earlier - that&#x27;s like we&#x27;re Al Quaida now. Because we run this war the same way they do. Like terrorists. The whole point of 9/11 was that we give up our values - freedom, democracy, rights, capitalism - and we did just that. We became exactly what they wanted us to become. Instead of forcing them to play by our rules. Can you imagine bin Laden having a trial? It&#x27;s the concept from our civilization. That even the worst monster - like a master mind behind the Holocaust - deserves a trial. That&#x27;s what differentiates our civilization from theirs. Applying this rule to Osama, and him partaking in it, is showing the Arab world the suporiority of our system. Going there and killing him like a dog when he isn&#x27;t armed, just execution mafia style, is showing them we&#x27;re not better.<p>At this level of decision, I believe that the political decisions always overweight military ones. These are the top SEALs, this dude would stand no chance this or another way. Forcing a trial on him and his organization and sentencing to hanging for crimes against the humanity - this would resonate much more and have better outcome as long as winning the war goes. You show them - you put planes into buildings and kill thousands of innocents - and we still give you honest trial. That&#x27;s what made us great. Believing in freedom. I think Arabs would be totally shocked to see that. They&#x27;d be more inclined to accept superiority of our system. And maybe that&#x27;s why Germans in WW2 didn&#x27;t fight after some point.

6624287,comment,6623459,6623712,1,0,Jare,,,"Mobile/appliance environment is much more portable, and many people invest less in it. A couple of ideas:<p>- Desktop devices tend to last much longer before being completely replaced (unless you&#x27;re a gamer). Even if you change your desktop machine, you often keep your keyboard/mouse, external NTFS drives, etc.<p>- There are more platform-specific apps that can tie you to a certain OS, either because of the app itself mat not be available (Games?), because you&#x27;d have to buy it again (Photoshop?), or because of the investment in workflow (MS Office?) or data (iPhoto?) that you have already made for it.<p>Once a mobile platform reaches a reasonable level of availability of popular apps, it&#x27;s essentially viable for anyone to switch to. Unless you are addicted to Hay Day or rely a lot on Paper, or something like that, it&#x27;s easy to move to a new platform. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s also crucial that aspiring platforms make it totally easy to port stuff, and here&#x27;s a place where Microsoft has made a huge mess with all their awesome but somewhat restricted tools, and constantly moving goalposts and platform strategy (C#? .NET? Silverlight? XNA? WPF? WinRT? HTML5? C++? Native or Managed or /CLR or...? I don&#x27;t even know anymore).<p>All that said, OSX and Macs are much more popular now than say 5 years ago, so there is some ship jumping. The cloud really is eroding people&#x27;s attachment to they desktops, and that&#x27;s the reason Chromebooks and even Linux have even a chance at reaching the mass market.",1382919121

Moreover, it has grown three years in a row, reaching more than half a trillion dollars in 2012. This is true even of live-television ads, which are the most intrusive and the easiest to avoid, yet are nonetheless growing at a healthy paceby eight per cent last year in the United States.</i><p>For every $1 one company spends on advertising, another has to spend $2 to steal your attention. Inevitably this means the industry will continue to grow infinitely as companies continue to try to buy your attention. Look at PPC, it&#x27;s a perfect example of an openly efficient market to buy your attention.<p>My favorite quote that illustrates this is from Seth Godin:<p><i>Attention is a bit like real estate, in that they&#x27;re not making any more of it. Unlike real estate, though, it keeps going up in value.</i><p><a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/07/paying-attention-to-the-attention-economy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/07/paying-atten...</a>",1382919056

The easiest way to do it, in my opinion, is to write the most customizable and modular code from the beginning. Because, inevitably, mid-project you&#x27;ll want to use something you&#x27;ve already written with a slight twist or use a class somewhere else where you didn&#x27;t know you&#x27;d need it - but now you can just drop that sucker in and spend no time making a totally new class for something so it doesn&#x27;t break something you&#x27;ve made earlier. It really doesn&#x27;t take too much extra time to do this either, especially if you&#x27;re constantly thinking like that - future proofing your code for the unknowable and very changeable design requirements. Loosely sticking to MVC has greatly improved my app coding. Here&#x27;s how I set it up:<p>* Controllers<p>* Data Objects<p>* Utility UI functions (making shadows, or anything that can happen anywhere)<p>* Data Managers (sometimes Singletons)<p>* Web Services<p>If I start with this model in my head, the code is self organizing because I&#x27;m not writing data parsing in a controller because I KNOW with 99% certainty that I&#x27;m going to parse something later in another controller or something even higher is going to handle that data at some point in the future.<p>This kind of abstraction is how I do it currently, and I&#x27;ve only gotten here through experience, and I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ll find even better ways as I continue to code into the future (I&#x27;m already thinking of base iOS project templates that contain that structure already).",1382918877

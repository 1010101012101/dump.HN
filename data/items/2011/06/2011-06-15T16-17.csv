2657911,comment,2657175,2657728,2,0,gamble,,,"There's no question that game reviewers can be cruel, but it tends to be limited to games that aren't produced by major publishers, because they can strike back by withholding review copies. Blackballing isn't about cost; (which is trivial) it's about early access to the game so that the review comes out immediately after the press embargo lifts. Gamers want to read reviews before the game hits shelves in the same way moviegoers want to see the reviews before heading out on Friday night. In exchange, game publishers get free publicity. It should be a symbiotic relationship, but the publisher has more power than the reviewers, and in my experience the bias is almost always toward over-kind reviews.",1308157185

Even if you memorize the exact location of the action you want in that tree, for many actions you still need several clicks to perform something instead of just one.<p>And that's not the end of it - you clearly need keyboard input too, in many cases. For example in WYSIWYG editors, you type-type-type, then you need a new header, move your hand on the mouse, select the right header in the select-box (during which your eyes also move from the current line), then get back your hand in typing position and start typing again, until you need another mouse action.<p>This is the reason I wrote my last resume in HTML and didn't even bother opening office, even though HTML sucks for typography (I'll probably switch to Latex next time).<p>That said, the mouse is better for browsing around, exploring stuff or for interfaces such as Photoshop.

Because while the keyboard users have been engaged in a process so fascinating that they have experienced amnesia, the mouse users have been so disengaged that they have been able to continue thinking about the task they are trying to accomplish.</i><p>It's there, plain and simple: keyboarding around switches off (or busy-waits) a part of our brain, while providing nice tactile and quantized visual (every character stop) stimuli in  regular interval. It <i>feels</i> faster, because that's how our brain is wired to measure time.<p>On the other hand, mousing around doesn't provide any cool stimuli until you actually activate the target widget. It feels long-ish, because the brain has to constantly work on adjusting cursor trajectory and nothing serious happens till you actually activate the widget.<p>The later argument is the case of rarely used commands. <i>Of course</i> ^S or ^P is faster than hunting the `Save...' or `Print...' through <i>modern</i> long menus, but that's an exception; an action to be taken once every few minutes. Manipulating text tokens and blocks (that's what we do most often, right?) is inherently faster with mouse than with Vim-ish or EMACS-ish regexps. Same for browsing hyper-text documentation or 'net forums.<p>Tell me you can select and move around a word, line or block of code faster with regexps than with mouse, and I'll gladly do it faster with mouse.

And I'm just engaged in trading.<p>Bitcoin is more <i>like</i> a currency than oil or coal, because it mechanically works a lot like one. But just because you say 'this is a currency', doesn't mean it actually is one. You are missing all of the higher level stuff. There is a reason a dollar backed by the US government is far more useful than a random coin 'backed' by a government of an island nobody recognizes.<p>My uncle is a mechanic, and has traded his time fixing commercial vangs for goods. We've had plenty of parties cartered in exchange for fixing the restaurent's delivery fan, or borrowed plenty of heavy equipment from contractors that need their truck fixed but don't have cash. Does that mean a tray of chicken marsala and a plate of bakery cookies are a currency? Of coruse not. Trade/bartering existed long before currency existed, and it still goes on today. Commodities existed long before currency existed. Being able to trade one commodity (bitcoin) for a good or service doesn't make it a currency.<p>We've learned this lesson over the last 200 years but a lot of people seem to ignore them. Most of the people pushing bitcoins harp on the fact that dollar keeps getting devalued, but they are ignoring the history showing that is a far better problem than a deflationary currency .",1308155372

But if you don't have that hsitory and you still have the need you won't be able to know the quality of people you're hiring except on the least granular of scales (lots of failed and low quality projects). This is a big reason behind so much of the problems of software development in ""the enterprise"". Because people who know how to run a bank or a media company haven't the slightest clue how to run software development, and there generally aren't trusted 3rd parties that people can go to for help.<p>Worse yet, there are perverse incentives at play.

They're one of the few players with a subscriber base close to Netflix (who just passed Comcast).<p>* They have a large network based on good technology. Sure, it's not fiber, but it's a lot better than what most of the RBOCs are sitting on, and Netflix has zero.<p>* As part of NBC, they have established relationships with all the major content providers.<p>* They own the distribution channel from content library, transport, and the end-user equipment.<p>The problem, from my experience, with Xfinity is that the ""experience"" sucks. Their cable box is a slow, buggy pile of crap. Browsing content on my cable box is only marginally better than the craptastic PPV movie systems in a cheap hotel. The new Xfinity apps for my iOS devices are a huge step up, but I'm not convinced that using my iOS device as a remote for my television is where I want to be. This is what the experience is like:<p>* Pick up my iPad and browser for ""OnDemand"" content
* Initiate playback from my iPad
* Switch to the Comcast remote to play/pause, ffwd/rwnd
* Experience huge lag in response to my control inputs from any of these devices<p>I've measured it, and it can take up to three full seconds for my cable box to respond to inputs. Three seconds is an eternity when you compare it to the Netflix app running on my PS3. Not to mention, with Netflix, I don't have to keep my iPad around. I can just use the PS3 remote to browse, select, play, and ffwd/rwnd content. And it's responsive.<p>Comcast has only themselves to blame for this situation.

No, it's not the same thing.<p>-- Also, speaking of seeing everything larger and scarier than it is, you really need to remember how good life is for most Americans. Some of the economic hard-lack stories make pretty funny reading for someone outside the US.

At some point, they will pay for this. This doesn't mean that Americans will be rooting through garbage and living on the street; the US still has the capacity to produce more than enough food and housing. Yeah, the spending binge will be over and it will be unpleasant.<p>-- Europe is not going to default on all its debts. That's a dumb move, and they know it. Argentina had essentially no economy for years after its default; no jobs, no banking, no credit, no business. Iceland is not exactly partying now after its bailout. I don't think they will be standing in line to join this club, and again, this is not a question of a lack of money; Greece has a spineless government and aggressive unions, and they simply don't want to pay up and expect a bailout which won't come, or at least won't be on pleasant terms.<p>-- China has immense reserves to enable it to live through a correction.

If it is to be a currency it must be able to be used to buy any commodity - in particular, dollars. If someone has to think about what they can't ""buy"" it may be useful to them but it's not as a currency. A currency has this property of universal exchange (and security, stability, ...) Bitcoin is questionable on many counts, thus is likely to remain a tradeable commodity only.",1308153862

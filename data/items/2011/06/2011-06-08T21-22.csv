One of the parts of my life where I grew the most in terms of self-confidence, concentration and productivity was a 6-month period where I had daily email checkins with what I termed my ""accountability buddy"".<p>The program is simple - every day, first thing in the morning you send an email to your accountability buddy. Include a list of the two or three most important things to accomplish today, and a short report on how your list went yesterday. (What kind of absurd mental acrobatics you went through to justify avoiding something, successes, failures, whatever...the stories can be pretty pitifully funny at times.)<p>Since it's a mutual thing, you'll probably also respond to your buddy's report from the day before. But the important part is looking at your situation and behavior in a way that lets you explain it to someone else.<p>I started this when I had a relatively high-burn lifestyle ($1k+ monthly rent, etc...), maxed credit cards, 10k of student loans, essentially no work experience and had been laid off my first real job after only 6 months.<p>Making daily promises to my accountability buddy allowed me to get over the daily fear and embarrassment of my situation and just do the things I knew would move me forward. (In my case I started a freelance career that has cleared all my debt and have several ongoing clients with more work than I can really handle.)",1307569928

Of course not.<p>SS isn't a tax because the benefits are (roughly) in proportion to what you pay?<p>> And, nobody in SS is subsidized by anyone -- those who max out don't pay any more beyond the max.<p>Do you really misunderstand this or are you just being annoying?<p>For low-income/low-contribution folks, the ROI for their SS ""contributions"" is positive.  The ROI for high-income/high-contribution folks is negative.  The positive return for the low-income folks is the money that the high-income folks lose.<p>On the off-chance that you think that SS problems can be solved by removing the cap, I'll explain why SS advocates introduced it.  They wanted a system that had popular support and didn't encourage organized opposition.  For popular support, they wanted to cap payouts.  To avoid organized opposition, they wanted roughly proportional payouts.<p>If you want uncapped contributions, do you want uncapped payouts?

There are simply perspectives trying to describe to the best of their vantage point.<p>This sort of claim is vulnerable to a popular philosophical dilemma: the more plausibly you interpret it, the less interesting it is; the more interesting an interpretation you give it, the less plausible it seems. (The tl;dr version of this argument is ""vacuous or false"".)<p>Here's a plausible interpretation of what you might mean: everyone puts their own spin on things, and no view of history is completely unbiased. This is <i>very</i> likely to be true, but it's also not very interesting. Everyone is likely to agree with it.<p>Here's a radical and interesting interpretation of what you might mean: all historical statements are completely perspectival; no perspective is more valid or more likely to be true than another; there is no way to choose among perspectives; all perspectives are equally valid. Now that's a bold, interesting claim. It's also preposterous.<p>Consider: two people arguing blame about WWI. One person laying all the blame on Germany. The other laying quite a lot of the blame on France. Well and good. Now a third enters. He lays all the blame for WWI (and the Great Depression to boot) on the Alpha Centaurions who (secretly) invaded our planet in 1912. These are all perspectives. Are they really equally valid? Are we unable to choose between them? Be careful how you answer: if you say, ""Well facts are facts, but when I say 'history' I mean interpretations of those facts only..."" That will only push your problems one step back. Are even all <i>interpretations</i> equally valid? Do you <i>really</i> believe that?<p>If I had to guess, you're aiming for the radical end (based on how you defended your original post), but I'm not really sure.

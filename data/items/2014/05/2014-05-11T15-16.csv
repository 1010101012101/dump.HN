7728956,comment,7728692,7728692,12,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"The main source of ideological disagreement between pro-systemd and anti-systemd users is just how much an init should handle. Anti-systemd side insists on init being just an init and not exceeding its duties, whereas pro-systemd are willing to make the init handle various other functions, due to the alleged benefits.<p>I think at this point it&#x27;s erroneous to call systemd an &quot;init system,&quot; it&#x27;s far more than that and Lennart himself freely admits it in (ironically) the article meant to dispel systemd myths (<a href=""http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/the-biggest-myths.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/the-biggest-myths.html</a>):<p><i>Well, systemd certainly covers more ground that it used to. It&#x27;s not just an init system anymore, but the basic userspace building block to build an OS from, but we carefully make sure to keep most of the features optional. You can turn a lot off at compile time, and even more at runtime. Thus you can choose freely how much feature creeping you want.</i><p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure about how optional the whole package really is. I know for a fact LXC tools like systemd-nspawn, Python bindings, etc. can be removed from the build using ./configure, but I don&#x27;t know the full extent to judge the veracity of his claims.<p>Olav Vitters of GNOME and Debian (I believe?) later echoes the same sentiment in a somewhat self-contradictory manner: <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/575790/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/575790/</a><p><i>Systemd is meant to do one thing and do it well: be the basic building block for Linux.</i><p>Of course, one must first define what a &quot;basic building block for Linux&quot; is, although that isn&#x27;t really elaborated.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t have any strong opinions in favor of or against systemd, but I do feel it was introduced in a rather rushed manner. I think it would have payed off better for the community if people researched certain alternate init schemes that were already present before systemd (not talking about launchd/Upstart), such as Richard Lightman&#x27;s depinit: <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20050206182736/http://www.nezumi.plus.com/depinit/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20050206182736/http://www.nezumi...</a><p>However, it&#x27;s probably a bit late by now, since systemd&#x27;s place has been set in stone, for better or for worse.",1399823349

The fundamental assumptions of shot noise are that you have distinct items arriving at an average rate, and that the probability of a single item arriving in an interval dt is proportional to the length of the interval dt.   Since light arrives in quantized lumps, and you expect an avg number of lumps that increases linearly with collection time, there is shot noise associated with it.   It could describe the arrival of buses, which also happen to arrive in quantized lumps, if you could somehow convince the drivers to increase your probability of being picked up proportionally to how long you wait at the bus stop.<p>It&#x27;s a nice enough hack, but the medium article is overselling &quot;probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics to produce a sequence of entirely random digits.&quot;   The arxiv paper is clearer and is much less of a sales job.<p>FWIW, the tough thing here is the nature of shot noise:  In some interval of time, the expectation value from a constant power of light is N photons in a single pixel.  The RMS deviation over a series of trials is sqrt(N).  So the phone needs to measure sqrt(N)/N accurately enough to pull out random digits.  The ratio sqrt(N)/N implies that you wish to measure low N, or low numbers of photons.  That a cell phone has such sensitivity is the key observation.  I expected the paper to have a plot of RMS(photons) vs LED output power to show definitively that the noise is photon-induced shot noise (there are other sources), but it is a nice paper nonetheless.",1399821442

7728852,comment,7728043,7728423,2,0,analog31,,,"That sounds reasonable. For a camera sensor, the noise budget is made up of four primary terms:<p>1. So called &quot;fixed pattern noise,&quot; i.e., a pixel by pixel pattern in the measured value that isn&#x27;t reduced by averaging. This pattern would be a &quot;fingerprint&quot; of the camera, probably long term if not forever. You can make a well averaged measurement of the fixed pattern (somewhat temperature dependent) and subtract it from subsequent exposures.<p>2. Thermal noise of the amplifier that converts charge into a signal that can be read by the analog-to-digital converter. This is referred to as &quot;readout noise.&quot;<p>3. Shot noise in &quot;good&quot; photocurrent, i.e., photons from the scene being converted into charge. This becomes dominant at higher light levels, as it&#x27;s proportional to the square root of photocurrent.<p>4. Shot noise in &quot;bad&quot; photocurrent, i.e., a constant leakage current in the light sensitive elements, whose magnitude is temperature dependent.",1399820894

7728850,comment,7726177,7726881,3,0,mavam,,,"(Disclaimer: Bro team member)<p>First, Bro is a Turing-complete scripting language (&quot;the Python for the network&quot;) and Snort/Suricata a system centered around regular-expression matching [1]. These two paradigms have fundamentally different levels of expressiveness.<p>Second, Bro&#x27;s core is <i>policy-neutral</i>. That means has no preconceived notion of good or bad, it simply provides information about activity. On top of that, it ships with numerous policy scripts to detect actual attacks. For example, there exists an SSH analyzer simply reporting the banner for each connection and byte-heuristic for detecting successful logins. On top, there exists another script that attempts to detect brute-forces by simply counting connection attempts per unit time. On the contrary, operators feed Snort/Suricata with rules which feed the system with malicious data. Your analysis is only as good as your rule set. As such, the systems spit out mostly attacks, which are useful iff calibrated to not emit a ton of false positivies.<p>[1] Snort features numerous enhancements for state tracking, but these are one-offs and hard-wired. For example, Snort supports &quot;pre-processers&quot; written C, which integrate at a much lower level of abstraction.",1399820866

Even today after this stuff has gotten cheaper, you&#x27;re costing them bandwidth fees, and likely increasing their server storage and CPU fees if it&#x27;s on a metered hosting service, which is quite likely nowadays. If you degrade their site&#x27;s functionality, you may chase away paying customers.<p>While technically correct, you are conflating the issues, because in none of the cases (that I&#x27;ve seen mentioned so far in this thread) the problem is with bandwidth/storage/CPU costs of <i>retrieval</i> to any significant extent.<p>Instead, it appears that almost all of the costs are incurred <i>before</i> retrieval: curating, sorting, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that it&#x27;s okay, but it&#x27;s just as much not stealing / thievery as downloading movies or music isn&#x27;t.",1399820841

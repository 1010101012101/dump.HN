Also, NY gives you a different experience based on where you live and the season. I moved in early winter and it was brutal! Also, be very aware of cost of living. My jaw dropped the first time I went grocery shopping. I never felt poor in the Bay area. In Manhattan, I was poor making low six figures.

Some of them might even be registered Republicans. Your constant repetition of the claim that voting for Mitt Romney was somehow an endorsement of a national version of Romneycare when the candidate himself explicitly campaigned on the opposite is, not to put too fine a point on it, silly. It is 100% consistent with federalist principles to believe that Romneycare might be great for the voters of MA, single payer might be great for the voters of VT, but that Obamacare is bad for the voters of the USA. It&#x27;s also not inconsistent to believe that Romneycare was a horrible idea, but that Romney was still preferable to the alternative Republican candidates and/or preferable to President Obama.",1383360725

6657927,comment,6650122,6653037,1,0,PavlovsCat,,,"Second-class? What about people in Gitmo, people without security clearances, people not in the NSA? Sorry, classified. On principle. Outsiders are not guilty until proven innocent, they are guilty, period. Insiders are innocent, period. That&#x27;s how I see it when I max out the contrast. That China or other countries are that way is no excuse to do the same, it is even more reason to be not like that. The US is not the only country doing it, but it&#x27;s the most powerful and it has the people in it that are used more than any to freedom. If the US falls too deep, the world would get real dark real quick, that&#x27;s how I see it.<p>> &quot;How many people have been tortured?&quot;<p>How would I know? e.g.<p><a href=""http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2012/1212/9-11-trial-Any-mention-of-torture-is-classified-military-judge-rules"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2012/1212/9-11-trial-An...</a><p>This blob of classified is, to those without clearance, just one, big, and in parts kind black, blob. It seems to like to snatch up things and return them 50 years later. Anything connected to that blob is by default important to me.<p>There also was something recently about something like this on HN, but I couldn&#x27;t find the link since the exact title escaped me. IIRC the defense attorney mentioned the plaintiff had been waterboarded 118 times, and the judge called him to order, because torture is classified. The question is, are some things mistakes just mistakes made in good faith, or does this structure of power consider itself beyond accusation out of principle?<p>> I don&#x27;t even know how to guess. A few hundred? Divided by 6 billion? 5 X 10^-6 percent of the world&#x27;s population, maybe?<p>It would not be 0.00something of some imaginary unnamed unit, it would not be a pure number in a vacuum, it would hundreds of <i>people</i>, each of them indivisible. And the severity matters, too. Don&#x27;t forget the drone strikes; being killed and then first responders getting hit with a second, delayed strike, is &quot;just&quot; one event, but for how much torture does it count? Why can&#x27;t honest mistakes not be acknowledged, and maybe even explained? Why can&#x27;t there be consequences for mistakes out of neglect or other reasons? Because everybody else has to go first? Then we&#x27;re fucked, because everybody else says that, too.<p>I would love for US media and citizens to expose such shortcomings in my country and all, nothing could be more helpful and welcome. It&#x27;s not about pointing fingers because others aren&#x27;t as bad as the US, not to mention worse, or because anyone could claim to sit on a high horse, it&#x27;s <i>about</i> everybody else being that bad <i>or</i> worse, and the US being so immensely powerful and influential. In my mind, the US should be the best bet against such things, not the country that does them the best.<p>And to me a deep, continuous concern is not &quot;outrage&quot;, either. Declaring something &quot;too much outrage&quot; is not a valid argument for something, and a useless argument against something. It&#x27;s really kind of a red herring.<p>How total has control to become before you start worrying about it falling into the wrong hands, into real deep shit at some point down the road? How would total control be safeguarded? Would even honestly striving for total control for the sake of &quot;good&quot; not be an argument for all other states to completey controlling their own territory, too? How would you try to ensure that you&#x27;d a.) always stay &quot;two-tiered but good&quot; and b.) never loose the race against the other fascist systems?<p>So, assuming the answer is &quot;you really can&#x27;t, you just have to hope and work hard and what not&quot;, how is the race itself not bad and crazy? Then why play with such kind of fires? Because it&#x27;s like a social nuclear bomb and we can&#x27;t even comprehend the scope before we detonated a few, a chain reaction with states that are just interacting with each other and all have more scapegoats than things to excuse? Why can&#x27;t the information age not be the age of being well informed, instead of being well informed on?<p>> Politicians live in the public eye.<p>Are you serious? In their private lives maybe, but these power structures are decisively not (trying to be) in the public eye, and as far as individuals <i>are</i> in the public eye.. if almost all things they say are soundbites, and if the public stops adding all those little soundbites and actions together, and has hardly any long-term memory, then the systems the &quot;visible&quot; individuals work for and enforce on others still becomes effectively invisible and untouchable.<p>> This has been shown time and again, in the US and elsewhere, that especially in the Internet age they get all the oversight needed.<p>Please, take me to that planet, I just don&#x27;t see it sorry :/ The internet tells me more and more about how much oversight is lacking, am I holding it the wrong way or something?<p>> Obviously the same is becoming true for agencies, given the prevalence of leaks and whistle-blowing.<p>Yeah, and given how those are being treated and mostly ignored, up until Snowden anyway. In reaction to which the NSA said they&#x27;d cut down on employed engineering a bit and use more machines, and effectively you&#x27;re saying this is getting better, well enough fast enough, so nobody should worry about this particular thing - because there was this one guy with this one set of documents, and because you&#x27;re sure there will be more?<p>The thing is, the worse stuff like <i>this</i> gets, the harder blowing the whistle on it will be. How much <i>change</i> did whistlebowers achieve so far? Any, at all? And do you think it made secret police in general more transparent, or more opaque?",1383360663

6657918,comment,6654341,6654341,2,0,dannysu,,,"I wish there was a good open-source POS 6 months ago! But I didn&#x27;t find any that fit my startup&#x27;s needs. I think it&#x27;s awesome that you&#x27;re doing this as it&#x27;ll help retailers a lot. We can exchange notes. A basic POS is the type of thing
that should have been solved already so we can move onto newer and better things.<p>I&#x27;m one of the co-founders of AvidTap (<a href=""http://avidtap.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://avidtap.com</a>). We&#x27;re a mobile retail company providing additional value by bringing the latest mobile technology to help retailers engage customers and enable a better way to shop. Think mobile wallet using NFC and Bluetooth LE (iBeacon), mobile loyalty, personalized experience, etc. We want all of our partner stores to be able to say hi to their customers by name, remember what their regular orders are, and just generally make it a more personal shopping experience.<p>In the beginning we looked around for an open-source POS since we believe we&#x27;ll be adding value on top of it, but unfortunately all the existing ones don&#x27;t fit our needs or can&#x27;t enable our target pricing. We ended up building one.<p>For a brief look at what we do, check out our HyperDrive demo day pitch here:
<a href=""http://hosting.desire2learncapture.com/Communitech/1/watch/393.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hosting.desire2learncapture.com/Communitech/1/watch/3...</a><p>You&#x27;re spot on in terms of the pricing. When we looked at the market, we talked to people that are still using the old fashion cash registers bought at Costco between $100 to $300. Then at the other end of the spectrum there&#x27;s the really expensive POS system costing $10K per station just to start. Or nowadays you can go with Square Register and get dinged a lot more per transaction than the rate an established shop would be able to get. We&#x27;ve been able to convert people using all of these systems to our system.<p>My company&#x27;s solution (<a href=""http://avidregister.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://avidregister.com</a>) is a complete POS package that sells for $425 for the hardware. We also let our customers buy the hardware themselves if they want. After that it&#x27;s $15/month subscription fee to help us add features, for support, and for the additional mobile features we provide. Some people really need the tech support and hand-holding. If you&#x27;re interested, AvidRegister is downloadable on Android Play Store and has a demo mode. Note that it&#x27;s only optimized for certain screen sizes. The good thing about it is that it&#x27;ll still work if the Internet goes down. It was one of our requirements.<p>We worked hard to get our pricing to basically the cost of an old fashion cash register so that everyone can have a modern system. That way AvidTap can then bring everyone to the mobile retail age like what Starbucks is doing already.
We&#x27;re using well known brands for receipt printer and cash drawer. If we use cheap no-name ones, then our hardware cost can go even lower. We also looked at potentially using Raspberry Pi but we had supply issues with that, on top of
having to find touch screen that&#x27;s within our price range. We ended up developing our own POS system to run on Android tablets. It&#x27;s a really nice system IMO. Android tablets can go below sub-$100 now btw.<p>Let&#x27;s get everyone a modern system so all retailers can move onto better things. I&#x27;m happy to exchange notes should you wish to look into Android tablets too.",1383360481

If the HOA&#x27;s insurance found out that an HOA board member or property employee knew about a residency violation, they might have grounds to cancel the policy, which would just end up costing the HOA money, which would raise the monthly dues of all owners.<p>Your (as the hypothetical owner of an apartment unit) insurance cares about whether you are occupying the unit as you said you would. I&#x27;m sure you can purchase a policy for primary residence, long-term leasing, and short-term leasing. If you&#x27;re violating your policy, it could be declared void at any time, in particular if you ever make a claim.<p>If I were a good insurance agent, hypothetically, I also wouldn&#x27;t write an insurance policy for short-term leasing in a property where I suspected such use wasn&#x27;t allowed. It would probably be in my best interest to get proof from the potential insuree that such use was permitted.<p>As for that rebellious streak, we&#x27;re talking about an investment here, and ways that people might be breaking voluntarily signed contracts in order to make a few extra dollars (the real-estate agent should offer the HOA terms to any potential seller, and then you sign the HOA contract when you purchase the apartment).

This, to me, is not helpful, since I have no way of knowing which are any good, even after reading them.  On the other hand, Info documentation will give me the official, up-to-date, correct, and mostly well-written documentation.<p>Internet searches certainly have their place if I want forum posts, mailing lists or blog posts, which I sometimes do.  But I often want the official documentation corresponding exactly to my installed version of the software, and this is often <i>harder</i> to find using a web search than simply using the Info documentation, because of the above issues.  Also, something to keep in mind in these modern times is that web usage is monitored.  Local reading of Info documentation is not.<p>Tools for searching Info pages are built-in to most Info browsers.  I use the Emacs Info browser, which has both the usual Emacs way of searching (C-s and C-r searches both in the current node and in the whole document), and the Info Index, which is what I start with when looking up the reference documentation for something.<p>Also, contrary to what you claim, Info documentation can and do contain images.  For example, the HTML GnuTLS documentation here: (<a href=""http://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/OpenPGP-certificates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/OpenPGP-certificates.html</a>) was generated from Texinfo, and the images are still there when I browse the corresponding Info documentation with the Emacs Info reader.

The master gave an order, the first mate repeated that order, the second shouted that order and so on, until one of the navvies translated the order into colorful language that a lady would blush at.<p>Just as we need to express our code in two different ways for the main codebase and the test codebase, we also need to express our intent in two different ways.

I fully admit that I don&#x27;t have all the answers. I&#x27;m hoping I can encourage competition in this field. Right now, I think there is a lot of irrational fear around payment processing and inventory tracking (seriously, they aren&#x27;t <i>that</i> hard, once you know what you&#x27;re doing. The difficulty comes from making early mistakes that you then have to either fix or live with). That fear keeps the market segmented into a variety of local monopolies.<p>Square didn&#x27;t think the local tax issue was that insurmountable to keep them out of the market. There are only just so many ways to slice-and-dice taxes. It&#x27;s leg work, but it&#x27;s not difficult work.<p>I&#x27;m going to get a little cynical on your last point. All my years of consulting have taught me that users don&#x27;t know what they want. Users see themselves as bosses, and like all bosses, they want to justify their existence vis a vis the system. If they don&#x27;t have input, they don&#x27;t feel like they have gotten their money&#x27;s worth.<p>That&#x27;s part of the motivation for making it so cheap. You can drive around the corner and open your bag and realize your McDonald&#x27;s cheeseburger for which you paid a whole $1.00 did not have cheese on it. And you&#x27;ll still eat it, because a regular burger was only $0.99 and it&#x27;s more important for you to get down the road than it is to argue about missing cheese for a whole penny.<p>But if you&#x27;re paying $15.00 for a burger, it better be the best damn burger you&#x27;ve ever had, exactly the way you want it, even though nutritionally it&#x27;s no damn better than the slag that McDonald&#x27;s is shoveling at you.<p>I don&#x27;t expect anyone but a true data and accounting geek to understand the best way to work out the data entry for a POS. There will be a lot of people who have opinions on it, but they will mostly have the wrong opinion. I&#x27;ve dealt with this in so many business intelligence situations: the client doesn&#x27;t know their numbers and <i>certainly</i> doesn&#x27;t know how to crunch their numbers. They will have opinions, but they will be extremely goofy notions of double-counting and comparing unlike units and dividing by magic numbers.<p>So by making POS dirt cheap--and democratizing the parts--I am hoping to be able to say &quot;take it or leave it&quot;.

Our target audience are the business-people who make decisions about technologies to use inside of companies. The rare few are engineers. Most are not. If you can connect well with these people (the challenges of working inside a big co., getting projects out the door, playing the political games, etc.), then you will get more bonus points! :)<p><i>About the Work</i><p>We are creating a series of guides as a part of a larger content-marketing vision. The guides we write will cover topics like, &quot;How to vet and hire a great mobility firm,&quot; &quot;Best practices for creating a compelling mobile experience,&quot; &quot;Advanced guide to understanding the cross-platform tools available&quot;, etc.
We have 2 full-time, awesome designers, who you will work closely with to make the pieces super-compelling. We will loosely borrow the style of these guides:<p>* <a href=""http://www.quicksprout.com/the-advanced-guide-to-content-mar.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quicksprout.com/the-advanced-guide-to-content-mar...</a>.<p>* <a href=""http://moz.com/learn/seo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moz.com/learn/seo</a><p>Looking forward to connecting.

The discussion thread: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6653827<p>My claim was that a project that took weeks or months to implement in RoR and Angular could be completely implemented in Meteor in 1 hour or so. My statements were not meant to attack the original author because he did a great job thinking out the UI, user flows and structure of the project, which I simply copied. Many users got angry at my claims and downvoted me, challenging me to prove my assertion.<p>Meteor is perfect for this type of rapid prototyping and I wanted to show the community what could be completed in 1 hour (56 minutes to be precise) on a Friday evening after work.<p>As promised, I cloned the functionality of the showcased project in Meteor in 1 hour.

6657831,comment,6657112,6657112,1,0,mcherm,,,"I would start with this:<p>First, research salaries in your area. In principle (practice never quite matches this) it&#x27;s your SALARY that matters, not your RAISE. For instance, many companies give much smaller raises to employees who are already well paid for their job title.<p>But if you can find evidence (from GlassDoor, surveys, any source is reasonable) that your salary is below what would be expected for someone of your experience and skills (or is only slightly above average while you are well above average), then get together some notes showing this before you go talk to HR.<p>And don&#x27;t go talk to HR. At most companies, they don&#x27;t have the authority to set salaries. Talk to your boss. (At many companies your boss doesn&#x27;t have the authority to change your salary either, but she DOES have the ability to go talk with those who CAN authorize it.)<p>Don&#x27;t threaten (unless you are ACTUALLY seriously considering leaving). Just explain in a matter-of-fact way that you feel like your are achieving quite well, but you do not think that it has been recognized and reflected in your salary. If you have evidence that others in your city or state are paying better for the same role, then mention that. Then ask &quot;Is there anything that you can do for me?&quot; or better yes, &quot;What is there that you can do for me about this?&quot;<p>Then shut up. You <i>WILL</i> feel uncomfortable having this conversation. In fact, you probably should have practiced with your spouse or a friend so that you can sound smoother than you feel. Act like it&#x27;s a perfectly normal conversation. But the truth is that your boss probably isn&#x27;t comfortable with the conversation either (most managers aren&#x27;t). So leave her hanging, and see what she says.<p>And be VERY open (you can even suggest this) to your boss taking some time to talk to people about it. Just don&#x27;t leave it open-ended: set some reasonable deadline (2 weeks?). You can also be open to some creative solutions. Perhaps they can&#x27;t change your salary, but they can offer you a bonus if you succeed at a major project. Perhaps they can&#x27;t offer you a bigger raise but they might be able to give you some stock options. Encourage them to find some way to make you happier.<p>And after the discussion is over, be sure to communicate how you feel. If you think that they made a real effort to meet you half-way and you appreciate that, then say so. If they said there was nothing that they could do for you then let them know that you&#x27;re not leaving (are you?) but that you are disappointed, and that you hope they will reconsider after you prove your worth on the projects you are now working one.<p>PS: If you find that your existing salary is actually a bit high for your current job title in your area, then you can still approach it, you just need to talk about the value you are adding to the project instead of the price that competitors pay.",1383358660

one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he
possessed was his own; but they had all things common.<p>4:33 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the
resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.<p>4:34 Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were
possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the
things that were sold, 4:35 And laid them down at the apostles&#x27; feet:
and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.<p>4:36 And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is,
being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the
country of Cyprus, 4:37 Having land, sold it, and brought the money,
and laid it at the apostles&#x27; feet.<p>5:1 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a
possession, 5:2 And kept back part of the price, his wife also being
privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles&#x27;
feet.<p>5:3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie
to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
5:4 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold,
was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in
thine heart?  thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.<p>----<p>He died, by the way.  Do you feel lucky?",1383357723

It&#x27;s stylish and affordable and Nokia is known for building things that last. The phone is great. But my feelings for Microsoft haven&#x27;t improved. Shortly after I purchased the phone, Microsoft announced they wouldn&#x27;t provide an upgrade path for Windows Phone 7 to 8. Then they announced they would release a mini-update to Windows Phone 7.8 for us that would bring some of the features. I waited six months or so for a tiny update and then they took it away and never released it on my phone. As long as Nokia is running Windows Phone, I will never buy another. And I certainly won&#x27;t ever buy another Windows Phone anything again after the way they treated their users. I feel like my phone is running a beta version of Windows Phone and will never get updated to the real thing.",1383357613

More often than not, I never actually read what I&#x27;ve written, the act of writing just makes it easier for me to retain the information.<p>Similarly, I&#x27;ve found that I can retain the content of electronic documents more easily if I type them out in a text editor. Sometimes I just delete the text, other times I retain it as a more portable version of the content.<p>Most members of my family think it&#x27;s strange that I work with paper so much (and continue to buy most of my books in paper form), given that I&#x27;ve made a living writing software and websites for almost 20 years.

I wasn&#x27;t doing it for any real reason except to see what it was like. Strange enough though afterwards I had no intention at all of continuing smoking tobacco and I now get extremely nauseous at the slightest smell of tobacco.<p>You can find quite a lot of information on psychedelic therapy although a lot of research was halted after those drugs became stigmatised and illegal.

No people on balconies, no people walking about. It&#x27;s like some kind of apocalyptic mirage. City planners really need to take a closer look at New York. It worked because small consumer shops exist on the ground level and people live and work on the upper levels. As pedestrians walk down the street they have amenities there for them. Contrast that with streets where there is a big building with not street level shops. It adds no value to the community. Very much like the design intentions of the projects in NY.

10142643,comment,10142019,10142384,0,0,unabst,,,"> Every facet of human knowledge is premised on how humans experience the universe<p>Absolutely. But that is why this is where we <i>start</i>. Before science, we had no way to invalidate illusions and validate what was real because assumption on their own are neither. They are naked intuitions pending validation. For the longest time we were unable to validate them and we ended up with the mess we had before science. Basically, no one would ever have made it to Mars.<p>But with scientific validation knowledge becomes more than just an assumption or an intuition based on an experience, or a theory we came up with that we find ingenious because, well, we came up with it. By overcoming our assumptions we achieve objectivity, universality, and factuality. We discover knowledge that has rigid practical persistence. In this process something transcends from our subjective personal ideas to becoming objective impersonal facts. There is no <i>self</i> in science. And it is from this arduous feat that technology is born. There is nothing in this monitor or the components of this phone that are based on assumptions. These devices are selfless.<p>&quot;Assumption&quot; is as evil a word as &quot;metaphysics&quot; and &quot;subjective&quot; in science. Yet, there are still people who use the word as a synonym for axiom. This is simply bad word-choice. The correct term here would be &quot;premise&quot; and you used it yourself. Theories can have premises, but not assumptions. Are the premises assumed? No. They are <i>granted</i>.<p>Since this is HN, here is an analogy to software. A program that assumes certain behavior code or of external APIs will be rigged with bugs. Every aspect of it&#x27;s execution must be tested, and the assumptions of the programmer must be eliminated by production. Of course, being human, we start with assumptions - such as &quot;this would be the perfect library for this project&quot;. The &quot;assumptions&quot; that we being with however, eventually manifest themselves into &quot;premises&quot;. And in software, these are the dependencies of a program. It is only natural for software to be dependent on other software. What is unnatural and anti-software would be to make assumptions about other software especially within its own execution.<p>The path from the assumptions of subjective raw experience to the subjective consumption of reliable technology is paved with the work of competent scientists (and analogously, by competent programmers).<p>> Given your definition, I don&#x27;t think anything we know would be considered a fact.<p>If fact is to mean truth, then sure. But there is an abundance of statements that have been backed by evidence. And all these statements are truer than most. Measurably truthier, rather, and that is what counts because that leave room for progress. This is a better definition of &quot;fact&quot;.",1440920987

I think one of the more interesting problems we have is that cyclists are treated as an outlier group within the UK.<p>There are certain cities that &quot;get&quot; cycling e.g. Cambridge ( <a href=""https://vimeo.com/133736570"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/133736570</a>) but persuading the general public that it is worth spending money on cycling is extremely hard. We have recently taken the approach to educate people that attend the Police Community Liaison meetings where they can spend 50%+ of the time discussing illegal pavement cycling, as to why it happens. <a href=""http://cyclebath.org.uk/2015/08/24/how-to-solve-pavement-cycling/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cyclebath.org.uk/2015/08/24/how-to-solve-pavement-cyc...</a><p>I truly believe that the transport policy of your local authority defines the health and wellbeing of your residents. I think the fact the cost of healthcare in the UK is &quot;hidden&quot; as it is &quot;free&quot; has subtlety enabled a car centric culture to persist. My father who lives in Florida stated that people are demanding cycle tracks. They want to keep fit and keep their healthcare insurance low.<p>In the UK obesity in boys is around 16%, in the Netherlands it&#x27;s around 1.6%.<p>The other problem with cycle infrastructure is that if it&#x27;s not good for a 7 year old to ride on, it&#x27;s not going to work for the general public. Segregation is key and definitely do not allow your local authority to create shared space where pedestrians and cyclists mix &quot;happily&quot;.<p>Then you have the biggest issue. Cycle infrastructure is only as good as the weakest link. So local residents can massively impact the quality of the network and thus the ability for people 5 miles away to make a decision to choose to cycle. So you get a piece-meal approach to cycle network development in the hope that it will join up eventually :(<p>As an aside, I noted somebody felt 10miles was too far on a bike. I would suggest investigating e-bikes. They are rather good these days and can happily tank along at 15.5mph (Europe), even faster in some countries.",1440918359

Biology draws from many disciplines, and it&#x27;s taken a lot of computer science to get to where it is now. But I think that the infosec community generally is pretty underwhelming in its application of statistical methods to big data. People seem to have limited imaginations when it comes to pattern matching, and too quickly jump to heuristics and &quot;machine learning&quot; without properly understanding the limitations of the data and techniques they&#x27;re working with.<p><pre><code>    To paraphrase provocatively, &#x27;machine learning is statistics\n    minus any checking of models and assumptions&#x27;.\n    ~Brian Ripley, 2004 [1]\n</code></pre>\nWe should really check out some of the stuff bioinformatics people have been doing. That&#x27;s not to say that <i>cryptography</i> has more to give to biology, quite the contrary. But I think the broader infosec community should try harder when it comes to doing stats properly. I think there is a lot more in common between bioinformatics and infosec analytics than most (on either side) realize. Huge amounts of messy, un/semi-structured data being the common theme.<p>In my (admittedly limited) experience, I find that wetlab biologists tend to have a better understanding of the limitations of the experiments they&#x27;re setting up, in terms of interpreting the significance, limitations and meaning of their results at least - than the computer science types playing in biology. But good stats is the one universal skill that all good scientists should master.<p>I spent a few years where part of my work was supporting evolutionary geneticists manage and figure out their data. Enormous amounts of data. So much raw data that the very large scientific institution I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve heard of couldn&#x27;t accommodate it in their normal data repositories (at least not if every researcher started doing so). Having multi-million dollar research projects conclude and then archived to a handful of redundant sets of HDDs curated by teams and departments that now no longer exist is unnerving (supposedly things are better these days).<p>In any case, it&#x27;s a fascinating area to work in for budding computer scientists. There are many problems to sink your teeth into, even basic stuff like repeatable analyses on research projects running for more than 10-15 years. &quot;Yes, there are faster/more robust/more appropriate MCMV (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) solutions out there but we don&#x27;t feel like re-running a decade&#x27;s worth of work to ensure they&#x27;re comparable&quot;. But I digress.<p>It amused me that each research team seemed to be either computer-science heavy (and ignorant about the quality or nature or &quot;ground truth&quot; of their data and the possibly embarrassing impacts on the signals they thought they were seeing), almost wilfully ignorant or at least dismissive of &quot;old-school&quot; biology methods and data...<p>... or were very wet-lab savvy and grounded in the raw biology side of things but limited their research questions according to the types of analyses they were comfortable doing themselves, using well-established methods, tools and software that would run on their biggest $20k PC under someone&#x27;s desk. Although that was seriously changing by 2013 when I left (partly due to nice big web-UIs in front of HPC clusters, partly due to better mixing of team capabilities).<p>Now, it&#x27;s easy to dismiss the latter group as just being not &quot;up to date&quot; or unskilled in &quot;big data&quot; (recent biology grad programmes are hopefully improving). But what was surprising was the obvious opportunities (to me) that highly CS-capable teams (inside and outside of the organisation I worked for) seemed to be deliberately staying away from. On more than one occasion I asked some of these people why they were ignoring the rich, machine-readable, highly-curated datasets from more traditional biology science (Eg. taxonomy/ID/phenotype/ecology info).<p>The answers are varied: they aren&#x27;t even aware this data exists in machine-readable form; they seem unfamiliar with the very biology discipline they&#x27;re playing in (they&#x27;re more obsessed with algorithms); but a disturbing trend seemed to be a generic distrust of manually curated data. I guess because there&#x27;s no repeatable algorithms to reproduce human curators :-)<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying everyone should go out and use that data as a source of truth, but it should at least be a reference to sanity-check or compare to. And imagine if you actually did augment your sequence data with this stuff - one (admittedly naieve) thought was that there might be a fun way to look for at least some phenotype influences in a given genome, &quot;for free&quot;, without having to start new wetlab work - i.e. just repurpose existing data.<p>When countering the aversion to manually curated data, I tried to point out that the very &quot;garbage in&quot; being dealt with - the genome sequences, spatial records, environmental layers etc. - all involve an element of human curation. I mean, that&#x27;s how we end up with nearly 20% of non-human genomes containing human DNA [2] in the first place. And that&#x27;s before we even consider whether stuff in the &quot;good&quot; 80% are even representative of the species group(s) of interest - you wouldn&#x27;t believe how easy it is for people in the field (or the lab!) to get species identification completely and utterly wrong. Or scrape up DNA samples of some infection or parasite instead of the actual thing itself...<p>... and yet even with all these imperfections in the molecular data, we find that some of the old-school morphological (phenotype-driven) taxonomies are still 80%+ unchanged (hazy on the numbers now) when reconstructed with purely DNA-derived phylogenies. And that&#x27;s on groups where we&#x27;re still fighting over what the best DNA markers are to build those molecular phylogenies in the first place! A lot of people don&#x27;t realize that the same DNA evidence can give different pictures of the evolutionary tree, depending on what genes you&#x27;re picking on...<p>Apologies for the over-sized rant, it&#x27;s been a while since I had to think of this stuff.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/6/the-two-cultures-statistics-vs-machine-learning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/6/the-two-cultures-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/science/17genome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/science/17genome.html</a>",1440918122

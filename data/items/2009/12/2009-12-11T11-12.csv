But where's the satisfaction?<p>And really, companies are going to look at you strangely if you say ""1 year Perl experience"". They'll think ""why on earth is someone learning Perl in 2009"". No, go with one of the newer languages - python or ruby.",1260532660
989548,comment,987693,988053,0,0,snprbob86,,,"Even if you overestimate ridiculously, it seems perfectly reasonable to keep the entire dataset in ram: 1 TRILLION tweets, at 500 bytes each is a data set of less than half a petabyte. A quick search shows I can get 4 GB of ram for $66 USD. Assume no redundancy, no bulk discount, and all other hardware is free, that is a cost of $8M or so (about half of their last round of funding, iirc).<p>Consider now that you don't need to keep non-recent tweets in ram, bulk buyers can get it significantly cheaper than individuals, and the dataset is far smaller than that, then throwing hardware seems far less impossible. I'd imagine that they could keep the last month in ram trivially.",1260532625

989546,comment,989392,989526,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"Firefox is not what it used to be. Remember the days when it was called Firebird and Phoenix? When it was actually a fast browser? Decisions at Mozilla now made with politics and not the user in mind. I'm hugely disappointed by Firefox's poor codec support for the HTML5 audio and video tags. This will make either the audio/video tags or Firefox irrelevant but there's one thing it won't achieve; making Ogg Vorbis and Theora popular. Seriously, what they're doing is pretty much an abuse of their market position. Firefox might be popular and mainstream now but if things don't change it will lose its relevancy really quickly.<p>I think at this stage the best solution would be forking Firefox. Remember when they forked out Phoenix from Mozilla to create a lightweight and fast browser that offers features that users actually want? I think it's time to do it again.",1260532405

989544,comment,989392,989526,0,0,indiejade,,,"I have trouble reading criticisms of Mozilla from just about every person who jumps on the ""Google can do no wrong"" bandwagon.  There's a definite benefit to the user to have a separation of control over the data that various tech entities have on it.  Firefox isn't selling anything; it is the only browser that truly allows users to decide what data websites gather from them as visitors.<p>Google developed Chrome because, for some reason, they thought that there's just _not enough_ ""Google Advertising"" online already, and they wanted to make sure that people can't easily disable advertisements, tracking cookies, etc.  I tried Chrome on Linux, and really . . . was not that impressed.  Firefox revolutionized the ""tabbed browsing"" concept, and that's the main fancy feature of Chrome.  In a way, Chrome kinda just stole all the great things about Firefox (things that have taken <i>years</i> to develop), put those things into a shiny blue curvy-cornered UI, and slapped the Google name on it.",1260532277

989536,comment,987366,987380,0,0,mock,,,"Because as a PHP programmer Perl will have areas of familiarity which may make the learning process easier.  In return, you will gain a greater appreaciation for why the PHP developers made the decisions they did by seeing how it was done in a language they borrowed heavily from.  As a bonus you'll learn to use a language that is ubiquitous in all sorts of sysadmin tasks, and have another tool that you can use when PHP isn't the right one for the job.  Finally, knowing Perl will allow you to use the huge wealth of CPAN modules available to help you solve almost any task.  At worst it will enable you to port them to your language of choice.",1260531295

989526,comment,989392,989392,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I have trouble reading just about any recent criticisms of Google from Mozilla as anything other than a crybaby's temper tantrum. It sounds like they are disappointed that Google acts as an independent company rather than merely a money train straight into Mozilla's coffers. It also sounds like they are more than a little upset that Google managed to put together arguably the best-in-class web-browser on the planet in a very short time frame just when they were getting comfortable with the idea that inevitably Firefox would be not only the best but also the most popular browser.<p>It seems that the Mozilla corporation was quite satisfied in its leading position in the special olympics race that has typified web browser development (Netscape under AOL failed so hard they killed their own once dominant brand, Mozilla took years to achieve reasonable quality, Microsoft is still putting out versions of IE competitive to the browser market in about 1999, Opera is a permanent bit-player, and Apple loathes the idea of writing a decent version of any of its software products that runs on windows). Now that there's some honest to goodness competition (in speed, usability, robustness, standards compliance, cutting edge standards adoption, and security) it's nothing but whine, whine, whine.<p>Dear Mozilla, stop whining, Firefox is an excellent browser, keep the effort going to make it even better and you won't have to worry about what big-bad-Google is doing because it won't matter.",1260530642

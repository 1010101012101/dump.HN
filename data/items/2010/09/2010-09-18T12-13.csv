Parents would groom one of their children to become a priest who might have otherwise gone on and been an average person in the laity. This was a respected position, and a pretty good living up until the last hundred years or so, so many would aspire to it. In many places in the world, to some extent, many still do. However, it is much, much harder to find priests than it used to be.<p>The church really needs to consider the fact that there were a significant number of women and married people in the early church, and that even though Jesus asked the disciples to put God and service to their neighbors first over family, he did not say that women can't be priests, nor that priests couldn't marry.<p>But, I respect that the Catholic church is doing the best it can given what has happened, which was awful, and my heart goes out to all of those affected, as does every Catholic I know.<p>I think anyone protesting the Pope though is probably less interested in actual reform than just emitting anger and promoting division in the church.",1284814628

1704126,comment,1702975,1702975,0,0,StavrosK,,,"This post only touches on the actual way that Shazam recognises music. The meat of the algorithm is in the feature detection, which must be much more robust than what the author did. His way is very sensitive to noise and maybe other manipulations (e.g. dilation), I didn't take too good a look at it.<p>Basically, to get good features you need to find a set of candidate features (points in the image that stand out) and then filter them according to some desirable properties (in standard image recognition, for example, you want them to be resistant to rotation, translation, stretching, etc). There exist very good algorithms for finding these features, which is what Shazam uses. Of course, after finding the features, you need to hash them in a way that is able to match any time in the song, resist noise, etc etc, so it's a very interesting application.<p>I was very surprised to learn that the best way to recognise a song was to convert it into a picture and then try to recognise that picture. It seems like a roundabout way to do it, but it works very well.<p>You can find more information in this paper: Viola and Jones, ""Rapid object detection using boosted cascade of simple features""",1284813917

One of the most frustrating things about using stackoverflow.com is finding a good question and having it be marked off topic or moved to another site to die.<p>I was recently trying to compare ereaders (with the iPad in mind) for technical PDF's. I thought stack overflow might have other programmers asking the same question, so I searched and found the page/question I was looking for. However, it was moved to superuser.com. Then, it was moved to some gadgets stack exchange. By the time it was on the gadget site, nobody was adding to it. Now, the gadget site is closed due to inactivity and I can't find the question's active URL (if there even is one anymore).<p>For reference, I think this was the original question on stack overflow:<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3000902/e-readers-for-pdf-nook-kindle-ipad-etc-closed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3000902/e-readers-for-pdf...</a><p>Overall, a very frustrating experience.",1284813865

For example, I've had great teachers - politics teachers, English teachers, professors in law school, etc - who didn't practice what they taught i.e. my high school politics teacher wasn't a politician, my university film studies professor didn't make movies, my law school professors were not practicing lawyers or judges (in fact my contract law professor was brilliant yet had only practised law for a year before turning to academia), etc. So it is conceivable that someone could teach or communicate something of value without having the personal experience of practising the profession they're teaching about.<p>Having said all that, when it comes to someone making grand statements about what constitute the keys to success, etc this may not be something that you can truly and credibly teach purely based on persoaln observations or academic study (as would seem to be possible regarding subjects such as politics, film and law to repeat the examples given above).<p>This seems more like someone attempting to teach or make statements about what it takes to successfully climb a mountain. Mountain climbing is one of those subjects - to which I would definitely add building a business - that can't really be taught by someone without personal experience. These are subjects where the 'lab' is the real world, so unless someone has been in the real world, they really don't have helpful lessons to offer.",1284813382

1704112,comment,1700623,1700623,0,0,kmfrk,,,"Create <i>one</i> edition of Windows at each release - at least keep it simple (stupid). Peope rarely figure out exactly what the differences are, what with abstruse spreadsheet explanations. When they finally get their hands on a version that isn't Ultimate, they are left with the feeling that they don't get the full experience, which detracts greatly from the joy of getting a new version of Windows.<p>In other words, it's detrimental to the brand and marketing of Windows - and Office, which seems to suffer from the same. There is no ""Windows"", ""Windows 7"" or ""Office 2007"" there is Basic, Somewhat Basic, Student, Enterprise, Ultimate, Blue, Purple, Turqoise, Cyan edition. I don't want Microsoft to <i>be</i> Apple, but just consider how easy iWorks and Mac OS X is to market by comparison. And fit into just one page.<p>I like that you'll call the next version of Windows ""Windows 8"", which, to me, is a step in the right direction. But the aforementioned is one of the many things that ensures that ""corporate"" will always be a part of a sentence about Microsoft.<p>I'm open to something along the lines of a ""Private"" and ""Enterprise""/""Business"" version, but I find it hard to believe that private super users won't want the features in the E/B edition. If you have to create separate versions, maybe you could make a ""Basic"" and ""Advanced"", which separates the users who don't need - or understand - the exclusive features from the companies and super users who do, and allows them to get a cheaper version without all the complex dingus.<p>(FWIW, I use Windows 7 and intend to do so for a while, but I'd love for Microsoft to be more of a start-up than a corporation. It feels complacent in some respects or just out of touch, which I assume is because it has to appeal to many platforms and customer types at the same time - but does it really have to show so much?)",1284812864

At that point (i assume) Google will do one of the following:<p>1) Make the requested changes and get it approved.<p>2) If they don't like the requested changes, they will make a very public post on the Google Public Policy or Voice blog like they did about their complaint to the FCC about the original app rejection (<a href=""http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2009/09/our-complete-letter-to-fcc-regarding.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2009/09/our-complete-...</a>)<p>Also to note, it is possible that the original Google Voice app submitted last summer would not work with changes Google has made to Voice in the past year.  So theoretically now that they know (or found out) that Apple will accept gVoice apps, Google could be working on updates to the app to get it to work before re-submitting it to Apple.<p>Either way, I think (hope?) that at some point in the near future the official app will come through.",1284812745

1704093,comment,1704023,1704023,0,0,po,,,"Keep in mind that that ""Why Django Sucks"" talk was given by a guy who very much loves Django.<p>I doubt that the Python community will ever spawn a web framework as <i>slick</i> as Rails. I think that the people who choose Python tend to have a very pragmatic, engineering bent and I don't think they value the slickness as much as the Rails community does. Keep in mind that Python is one of the few languages that Google writes code in.<p>Probably if Rails closed up shop today, more of the people that value that would move to python. Rails tends to draw what I would call the ""web 2.0 crowd"" who make very slick, very stylish websites. You can do that in Django too but you have to be willing to hire a designer. Ruby/Rails tend to see that as a core competitive advantage. Python has a much longer history and therefore tends to be more conservative. You can see that reflected in Django's release/deprecation schedule. Neither of those approaches are bad things. Diff'rent strokes for diff'rent folks.<p>I think both of those languages/frameworks are better for each other although Python frameworks are better at borrowing ideas from Rails than the other way around. That's probably true of many frameworks though. They're not all that different, and I think you should probably learn and/or try out both.<p>I think both Django and Rails need to look out for the winner of the web battle in what I see as the up-and-coming language/framework: Javascript/Node.js<p>This is all, of course, just my opinion.",1284811264

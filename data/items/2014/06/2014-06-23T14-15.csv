7932289,comment,7931218,7931222,1,0,bunderbunder,,,"> Where is this going?<p>Not far&#x27;s my guess.  If BTC gets too popular as a tool for extortion and money laundering, then the authorities in developed countries are going to start carefully monitoring people who sell large quantities of BTC for sovereign currency or commodities. It would just be another part of their general efforts to combat organized crime.  That would make major speculators feel less welcome.  If major speculators decide to take their ball and go play somewhere else, the price of BTC will probably tank.  That&#x27;ll discourage everyone else.  At which point BTC becomes a terrible medium for money laundering because nobody wants to buy them.  I also suspect that the relative anonymity of any one transaction is closely related to overall transaction volume in the BTC economy.",1403535570

7932280,comment,7932013,7932013,5,0,krapp,,,"Wordpress dominates, I think, for a number of reasons. Primarily, low technical debt for users - it&#x27;s as close to a plug and play application as i&#x27;ve seen, and nowhere are you expected to understand &#x27;arcane&#x27; concepts like version control or the terminal. Want a plugin? Done entirely through the web GUI. Want to upgrade? Same thing. New theme? Same thing. The vast community also helps, obviously, but that community is only as big as it is because the barrier for entry to setting up and modifying a Wordpress install (assuming all you want is to use existing plugins and themes of course) is so low.<p>Also, many existing webhosting accounts come with an option to install Wordpress on the account. Wordpress even has its own self-hosted service. Many of the alternatives i&#x27;ve seen, in terms of frameworks and CMS software, haven&#x27;t been able to replicate the relative painlessness of Wordpress&#x27; model.<p>A contender would, first, have to deal with the network effect of Wordpress which is considerable, but also (if it&#x27;s written in a language other than PHP) the network effect of PHP. Since the UX in Wordpress generally works pretty well, switching to another CMS would be a difficult sell to the general user (why switch from something that&#x27;s easy and works and you can hit a developer for by throwing a rock out of the window?) meanwhile most of what is terrible about Wordpress is only apparent to coders, who frankly don&#x27;t really matter in this dicussion, since they&#x27;re probably using Octopress or something anyway.",1403535472

7932278,comment,7931744,7932134,6,0,Peroni,,,"When the site was originally designed, there were only 4 or 5 sizes, one for the feed, one for the product page, one for related products, one for thumbnails, etc.<p>As the design changed, extra sizes got added to the image processing, and as with most early stage start-ups, it worked therefore there was no need to fix it.<p>We eventually ended up in the position of having 2.5M products all with preprocessed images of certain sizes from our design history. As we wanted more flexibility with design, but also knew that a lot of our images would have a very low likelihood of being accessed (fashion items have single runs and are never remade in future seasons), a big batch process didn&#x27;t seem appropriate. Additionally, it would mean storing several different copies of images in our S3 bucket, even if we knew the product would not likely be seen again.<p>A more attractive solution (at least to us) was to do the hybrid approach, where we would resize on demand, and then cache for a long time. This way, we only do the processing for images that need it, in almost a functionally identical way to large scale batch processing, but the process is demand-led.",1403535465

But what I noticed was back in the early 2000&#x27;s PHP was the craze; a simple language for the web, it was those one-click LAMP/XAMP installers. All in all it was just a bunch of small circumstances drawn together that snowballed into enough momentum for the mainstream spotlight.<p>A ton of budding &#x27;techpreneurs&#x27; whose $family_relative_or_friend &#x27;knows PHP, therefore can wrangle Wordpress&#x27; could get them a site up and running when they &#x27;come over to their house for some snacks and chips over a weekend&#x27;<p>&quot;Why aren&#x27;t there any contenders?&quot; Those entrepreneurs are now successful businessmen who have enough budget to keep being on Wordpress, because &#x27;it just worked&#x27;.

It&#x27;s more of the can I get my $son to do that for me on a saturday afternoon given the following X things I need.<p>&quot;Clearly WordPress thrives on its massive community, and maybe its just a matter of time until a worthy opponent emerges to gain the necessary momentum.&quot; Yes, empires rise and fall.

It had its limitations, but it worked as a laptop, desktop, and a tablet. Each scenario had its limits and the most limited one was the laptop perspective. As a tablet it worked great with movies, browsing the web, light gaming, etc. As a desktop it was powerful enough to run the adobe suite on an external monitor. But as a laptop the kickstand and keyboard were not ideal.<p>The Surface Pro 3 removes some tablet usability and improves on the laptop experience. I am not sure if this is ideal. I recently upgraded from the Pro 1 to the Pro 3. I am having a hard time using the 12&quot; screen as a tablet in bed and on the couch. Using the device with pen in hand is harder due to the larger screen real estate. Even using the Metro side of things is more cumbersome due to the larger screen. Tiles and settings on touch interface are too far apart now.<p>After a few days, I have concluded that the Pro 1 was a better &quot;tablet&quot; with the ability to be a desktop and laptop. The Pro 3 is more of a laptop/tablet hybrid with a focus on laptop-ability. Even with all the new enhancements, I think I will return the device and purchase a Pro 2 instead.<p>Edit: I used the Pro 1 as my main machine for almost a year. The pen was useful in photoshop/illustrator. I also used it for gaming; Fifa 2013, Civ 5, and some indie games.",1403535049

I am sure there are loads of companies that are perfect for you, because they only require blue collar programming drones.<p>First of all, I care about my coworkers to the extent it is necessary to work together. Also, if they ever run into hardships, I am willing to help out if I can. It&#x27;s just basic human decency that I will afford to anyone in my life, not just coworkers. But at the end of the day, I am primarily seeking a mutually profitable business relationship, not an emotional relationship.<p>Second of all, I don&#x27;t have the need to become friends with my coworkers. If it happens spontaneously then fine. Work is a good place as any to make friends. If it doesn&#x27;t happen, I&#x27;m really not going to lose my sleep over it.

If he assigned it 0, no matter how good the experimental design was, and no matter what the test was, he would be unmovable from this position. 0 is forbidden if you want to accept it as a possibility. This is why he says this.  He also is being honest about his appraisal of the general likelihood of ESP. It&#x27;s very low. He doesn&#x27;t bother to explain how low because it turns out it&#x27;s IRRELEVANT.<p>You literally have to believe ESP is the most likely explanation among all the usual alternatives ALREADY in order to think it was ESP after ingesting the data, because the data in this test is not EVIDENCE for ESP, because P(E|sort of works ESP) and P(E|one of the assistants wore glasses and Stewart could see some reflections) or whatever your remotely plausible alternative - all look pretty identical.<p>It is not evidence, in the sense that you cannot do 500, 37,100, or a 1 million card guessing attempts in this setup with this level of detail and expect it to shift belief of a rational agent.

Go to the public research body rather than the general internet and spend some time finding some reviews (I mean proper peer-reviewed reviews), look for ones that are highly cited and ~5-10 years old. Then start following up, with standard procedures. This seems an important topic to you, and you&#x27;re unwilling to follow the modern wisdom - which is completely fine, no criticism from me over that. So I would recommend spending at least a couple of weeks on this, go down to the primary experiments that the reviews draw on and see what the researcher&#x27;s are really debating with each experiment. Look how the experiments being done have informed recent reviews and why viewpoints are changing. Make sure everything you&#x27;re reading is peer reviewed, or you will waste a lot of time. Without two years+ in a subject, filtering the bull is hard.<p>I would also be very careful about whether the researchers are indirectly or directly being paid by the recruitment industry rather than centrally funded, since commercial funding makes the validity of the results more uncertain.<p>So I&#x27;m not saying &quot;Google it&quot;. I&#x27;m saying do some bare minimum reading on the research corpus.<p>-----\nJust to go back to the above message. I&#x27;m not saying have no hiring process, obviously you need to evaluate the candidate. But for me, once I&#x27;ve checked for egregious personality flaws, they don&#x27;t need to be my friends. Think of it this way: falling out with friends is terrible and likely to be very destructive to morale on your team - people will take sides and within the space of an hour your company has been ripped apart. Office politics will be much greater, while bad decisions based on emotion - &quot;can&#x27;t fire him, we had a real heart to heart last night&quot;, &quot;let&#x27;s do this because I like x more than y&quot; are much more likely.<p>If you&#x27;re pros, then melodrama becomes much less likely.

But an honest &quot;I don&#x27;t know/am not sure, but I think...&quot; is a much, MUCH better answer than trying to bluff. If you&#x27;re right after prefacing it with that, it&#x27;s nearly as good as having bluffed correctly (the interviewer knows you didn&#x27;t know or were not sure, but your knowledge of the tech is sufficiently good for you to deduce what unfamiliar constructs do), and if you&#x27;re wrong, it counts nowhere nearly as badly against you as if you bluffed incorrectly (as you at least are showing you know and admit to what you don&#x27;t know).<p>Now, obviously this is also partly dependent on the level of knowledge needed to answer the question. If you are, say, applying for a Java job and don&#x27;t know what private means, you&#x27;re probably not getting the job. But if you&#x27;re applying for a Java job, and are asked for the difference between soft, weak, and phantom references, and respond &quot;I&#x27;m not sure...I know the first two have to do with keeping references to objects that should not prevent garbage collection, like when adding items to a cache or something, but I don&#x27;t remember the difference between them, I&#x27;d need to look that up. And I&#x27;ve never heard of a phantom reference&quot;, and then asking about them if there are no follow up questions, is still pretty damn good. And &quot;I don&#x27;t know; I&#x27;d imagine from the name they have to do with referencing an object in a way opaque to the garbage collector?&quot; is also very good. &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; is okay, it just might mean we&#x27;d not be willing to hire you on as a senior dev, but if you nail everything else maybe one level below that.",1403533956

However, on a technical merit perspective, the web is much more evolved, and much more a technical feat, than either Android or iOS.<p>Android and iOS are a reiteration of what has been done cyclically through times, ever since the first OS got written. A set of libraries and associated APIs on top of a constrained set of hardware.<p>The web is, as an application platform, a set of APIs. That&#x27;s it. There&#x27;s no defined hardware, no defined set of libraries. Guess what? Designing the API alone is much more difficult, a lot harder to get right, and much more of a technical feat.<p>On one side, some libraries got written and then documented. On the other, everything is defined conceptually (well, not really; if done like this it would be really impossible instead of just difficult, but the point stands).",1403533719

The site, allowed a restaurant/shop/bar owner setup a couple types of deals ie &quot;Buy X get Y Free&quot; among others. Each restaurant had a QR code, and when someone would purchase something, the customer would scan it and get a &quot;punch&quot;. The owners could track everything via the web. Due to all of us having a 9-5, and this being our first project, we failed, because we didn&#x27;t realize beforehand that you had to hit the streets every day, and we didn&#x27;t have the capital to quit our jobs when we figured that out. The only way, to really sell a product like this, was cold calling. Adwords, facebook, etc etc, does not work when trying to reach a small business owner/manager. They are too busy working, to go out randomly searching for stuff. Needless to say, we learned a ton about selling. So, I developed Sales Invaders!. A &quot;sales staff as a service&quot;.

By moving the stingray around, authorities can triangulate the device’s location with greater precision than they can using data obtained from a fixed tower location.&quot; This technology could very well advance, and allow them in the future to collect much more maybe.

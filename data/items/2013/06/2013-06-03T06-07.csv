5811794,comment,5804134,5810730,3,0,infinity0,,,"Maximizing individual payoff is not necessarily contradictory to more intuitive notions of ""fairness"". One ignored variable is the timescale you're maximizing over. If your company spends money on other things than exec pay, you (and others) are very likely to do better in the long run, in ways that are not mathematically (or computationally) quantifiable, at least by existing theories (or resources). But just because something is not quantifiable does not mean that considering it is ""irrational"". Rather the opposite, you are using what computational resources you have personally (emotions and intuition) to judge this, rather than ignoring it completely.<p>This is why I get supremely annoyed at claims that a specific non-mathematical argument is ""irrational"".<p>(Examples of non-computable things: company spends resources on R&D and makes more long-term profit; company spends resources on higher pay for everyone else and boosts morale; reputation of company increases and you attract a wider pool of potential employees; etc.)<p>In more mathematical terms, greedy optimisation algorithms in the name of short-term ""rationality"" most often lead you to a local, not global, maximum.",1370242744
5811793,comment,5809724,5811109,2,0,Pamar,,,"Sorry but this is pretty naive. The link you proposed is for a Chess variant.
Now, in an abstract game like Chess, I may agree that using a square grid (and allowing diagonal moves) may be ok. In a wargame, though, or anything trying to ""simulate"" reality (e.g. a role playing game) using a square grid with diagonal moves will result in the ""interesting"" phenomena where moving your tank towards North-West would boost its speed by more than 40% (square root of 2=1.414...). And this would be even worse in case of favorable terrain like roads or plains.
The reason why hexagons are favored is because they can perfectly cover a plane and at the same time you move a constant distance no matter which side you are exiting.<p>So you should at least qualify your ""overrated"" statement by saying ""for abstract games where speed/range of units is not considered an important feature"".",1370242740

But I can't interview everyone whose resume I receive: I can only pick the best resumes.  When a candidate failed the interview process, I tried to figure out the error I made (if any) in order select better resumes in the future.<p>And I agree that schools are different.  I occasionally considered candidates from schools that people snicker about, like San Jose State.  But they had better have aced everything and really stand out from the pack to overcome that handicap.  Sometimes, great people have life circumstances that corral them into lame schools.  On the other hand, I'd give pretty serious consideration to a candidate from Harvey Mudd or CalTech with a 3.1.  (But even at those great schools, the < 3.0 rule seemed to apply: candidates with a really low GPA couldn't pass the technical parts of interviewing.

5811779,comment,5809012,5810227,5,0,waps,,,"To convince C users why Haskell has the potential (but currently only potential) to optimize better, it is best to just point to one example that C can never hope to optimize : deforestation.<p><a href=""http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/profiling-and-optimization.html#id679430"" rel=""nofollow"">http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/profiling-and-optimiza...</a><p>C will never be able to do that. Before optimization : the programmer requests a list to be created, fill it by calling functions and then passes the completed datastructure list (or tree) along to another function, which executes commands according to what the list contains.<p>After optimization there is no more list. Instead the function the list is passed to will call a generated function that generates exactly the needed elements of the tree just-in-time. Result: no list, no memory (aside from 1 element on the stack), no allocation, no clearing of memory afterwards.<p>Of course the downside is that it's very tempting (and encouraged) to write programs that don't contain these optimizations you'd have to do manually in C/Java/... and just have them run. What you'll miss as a Haskell programmer is that the program is effectively dependent on those optimizations for it's complexity (for example: optimized program is O(n), program as written is O(n^n). Then you insert what looks like a tiny change, say, sorting the list, which prevents optimization from happening and <i>boom</i>, your binary switches from O(n) to O(n^n). All tests will obviously pass, yet your boss is unlikely to be happy ... At this point it is extremely hard to figure out what just happened)",1370242446

They always pop into Hacker News with dramatic headlines, begging you to see what the author's radical notion is.<p>In reading this post, I have a <i>very</i> hard time sympathizing with this author's point. He's taking his personal expectations and experience of Facebook and projecting it to a catastrophic failure of the entire company to reach its audience - that's unfair at best, and honestly narcissistic. Nearly a billion people use Facebook, it's not a failure. This is like saying Google has botched search. No, Google and Facebook practically <i>control</i> their domains.<p>Is there room for disruption? Sure. Is Facebook perfect? No. But I believe the author is using Facebook the wrong way based on his points. It's not a professional platform. I don't use it the same way I use Twitter.<p>A rebuttal, in order of points made:<p>><i>Jump through hoops...share selectively.</i><p>News flash, most people <i>don't care.</i> I actively use Facebook and I've literally never touched the selective buttons for what to share with who or what to delineate between friends. I use Facebook for <i>friends</i> - there isn't a boilerplate for this when you sign up. It's for <i>friends</i> - the only reason Facebook introduced this was so that you could share that funny, raunchy video and your girlfriend's mom won't see it.<p>><i>As you use Facebook...you accumulate friends.</i><p>This entire point is null and void. You set it up by implying you have no control over the friends you make or the groups you join. That's blatantly false. Just don't friend professional coworkers or acquaintances. Again, not difficult.<p>><i>Loudmouths now have gigantic megaphones.</i><p>Dude, <i>skim</i> or <i>limit</i> your newsfeed. Are you so intolerant that you feel didactically opposed to the feature? It's not as painful as all that, you pass a status, read the first sentence, and decide if you have interest. If not, move on, don't comment. If it really offends you, defriend the person or limit what you can see from them on your newsfeed. There's a button literally <i>next to their name.</i><p>><i>Social media scamsters.</i><p>I'll give this to you. However, I personally find more amusement than anything. And while I don't want to criticize you, you <i>might</i> want to be more selective in who you see sharing from on your newsfeed. I find the people who share this (gullible friends) are outliers and you can deal with them individually in the same manner as the above bullet point.<p>In summation, I believe the author doesn't understand <i>why</i> his qualms are actually <i>features</i> - it seems as though he's using it for the wrong reason. I'm not going to say Facebook is flawless. It's not, there is a lot to critique and it has things that could be improved. But all of this is not constructive criticism and it's mostly doom-seeking. Does he have a better idea for a social network? How can he condemn Facebook as a failure? His authority and points don't support that claim.<p>If you're looking for a system where friends are not just friends, but <i>everyone you know</i>, and you need selectivity in sharing or conversations, go to Twitter or Google Plus. If you want to kill time and have more or less the same experience with friends, with the same annoyances (native to social interaction, not the medium), go to Facebook.",1370242007

Personally, I find that there's too much friction between choosing which friend belongs where and then further choosing the appropriate group when sharing content. I might just be lazy but it just doesn't work for me.<p>I also think there's a certain value in being well behaved when sharing content if you have people on there that you wouldn't want them to see, for example colleagues, managers and, more importantly, children. For example, I look after a  2.5 year old boy and I do not use curse words in his vicinity nor do I look at pictures of boobs when he can see. It's just not proper. However, I'm free to do those things when he is in bed and out of the way (with regards to boobs, I don't but me and my fiance will behave like adults).<p>Based on this, rather than a whole bunch of categories for your friends, why not set up certain filters? This could be quite simple: Do not allow friends under the age of x to see my content at all after HH:MM and before HH:MM. These can also be set on a per-friend basis so if you have a couple of colleagues as friends that haven't set their workplace, you can set something like this up for them too.<p>A way to only share to certain people is great but FB has this and it's adequate: groups. I founded a number of programming groups and I will share stuff relating to that to them rather than my news feed since it's more suited to them AND there are many people in there I'm not friends with. It's a great way to get good, categorised discussion and the added bonus of meeting new people.<p>As I said, I don't think it's very valuable, not in terms of technology but in terms of society, for people to be able to share unlimited amounts of content at all times which you wouldn't share to the whole public.<p>""- Facebook gets worse the more you use it...""<p>The disagreement with this is good too: it's the way you to use it. I use FB slightly differently but, as said above, setting up my programming groups and inspiring others to do the same has created a great community within Facebook and I can honestly say I've had some very decent conversations as a result of this, even with people I don't know or never met. This isn't what FB sells itself as but it can be done quite easily and I see value in that.",1370241937

The implication is that you don't want to be parallelizing at too low a level. You want to be doing it at a much higher level if you possibly can.<p>If you have an 8-core machine and thirty independent tasks at the top-level, then all the functional programming research and parallel algorithm wizardry in the world isn't going to make you want to parallelize anything except the top-level tasks. So even if that's a verbose and error-prone task due to procedural programming constructs, at least you only need to do it once. Heck, in my own (admittedly limited) experience 90% of the hard work I have needed done has been handled by my OS's process scheduler and Redis.<p>The fact is that business applications, the web, and consumer software are all perfectly happy to accept the current limitations of hardware -- 12 processes running on 4 cores is efficient and easy, even with no parallelization at all below the OS process level (with the possible exception of GUI threads in desktop applications).<p>The only really interesting work happens in areas like HPC where you have 1 task and 900 cores and if you can't parallelize you are dead in the water, and latency-critical applications where the sacrifices made to run intra-task parallelization pay big dividends.",1370240835

Often there are hundred of people following a tornado warned cell out in tornado alley - its been called Chaser Convergence, basically a traffic jam around a tornado.

Moreover, Chrome depends on system and external libraries that provide C/C++ headers. Any viable alternative would need to work with C/C++ headers without needing large amounts of glue code, which isn't necessarily easy.<p>People still use C not because all of their code is so performance-sensitive that they can't deal with the overhead of bounds checks and garbage collection, but because there still aren't reasonably high-performance alternatives can easily integrate with existing codebases. Go and Rust are two promising contenders in this regard, but the former has only recently achieved C-level performance, and the latter is still not ready for production use. With that said, Mozilla is writing a browser in Rust (Servo), which shows their aspirations.",1370239569

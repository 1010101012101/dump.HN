When to arrive, can I have a coffee in the morning, how large are the offices, how much do I need to use my phone or anything.<p>The other question I like to always ask - how do you treat professionalism? Of course every employer says that you need to be professional and your work has to be professional. But there are many places where quality is not really matters (lets say it this way). So why do they need professionalism then? (I hope I was clear.)<p>Also asking about possible challanges is a good thing in my opinion. Some employers might mean high workload and high stress under the term challange. (Dynamic, young team is also a term which makes me afraid sometimes.)",1386334782

6860814,comment,6845585,6858766,1,0,frowaway001,,,"> You think Scala helps achieve those goals, I think Scala is detrimental to them. I abandoned Scala about 5 years ago and I have no intention of using it again, especially now when there are languages which I find superior to Scala in every respect that I think matters. If you feel Scala works for you I&#x27;m not going to convince you otherwise. For me and for the organizations I&#x27;ve worked for it didn&#x27;t work at all.<p>I think this explains all of it. The thing you are talking about has pretty much no resemblance with Scala today. You can bash Scala-from-5-years-ago as much as you want as long as you stop misleading people that your claims are in any way relevant to what Scala is today.<p>Really, look at how your extrapolations from pre-historic Scala versions worked out til now. You only embarrassed yourself. I recommend being honest next time and just sharing your experience about Scala 2.5/2.6/2.7.

We&#x27;ve got a PM who&#x27;s going to give a presentation on contracts and scoping work in January, and we were chatting about problems freelancers face.  A couple guys in our group have been getting abused in much the same way you describe, although f2f and in the same town, not remote via odesk.  And... trying to get people to go through a full &#x27;statement of work&#x27; process before getting started is just something that will fall flat with most projects under a certain amount, however informal you try to make the process.<p>What we all agreed on is that there are some number of abusive people out there, much like you described.  No amount of process, formalizing agreements, etc will save you from dealing with them.  They have to be avoided, but you have to know how to identify them first, and you have to be willing to walk away from work, sometimes even in the middle of a projects.  None of that is easy for some people - especially younger folks.<p>And yet... by the same token, I get contacted from people who tell me &quot;my last guy just quit - just quit responding to emails - he flaked out - etc&quot;.  I used to think those people were just irresponsible idiots, and I was going to provide great customer care, etc.  I now realize there&#x27;s 2 sides to the story, and sometimes the original party &#x27;flaked out&#x27; because the employer in question quit paying or bounced checks, or is abusive, or a micromanager who&#x27;s never satisfied and wants an ebay clone for $25 and will call you at 1am because they need help setting up their wife&#x27;s email on her new iPhone.",1386334083

He&#x27;s specifying a bunch of fields like this:<p><pre><code>    &#x27;zone_2&#x27;: 0,\n    &#x27;zone_3&#x27;: 0,\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nMy SQL query already handles that simply by making `zone` one of the columns. Seems I missed the `shipment_type`:<p><pre><code>    SELECT date, carrier, zone, shipment_type, COUNT(id), SUM(price)\n           FROM shipments GROUP BY date, carrier, zone, shipment_type;\n</code></pre>\nThat replaces another 7 of his lines (`next_day_air: 0, ...`). It&#x27;s also future proof - if a new shipment type or zone is added, the bog standard SQL code still works.<p>Those fields would need to be on the create table. The simplified create table I wrote was simply to illustrate the fact that SQL also handles the issue of &quot;We rarely used most of these entities without the other&quot;. Or maybe you would join against them, in which case my 3 line solution becomes 4-5 lines.<p>It&#x27;s not for nothing that people like to build SQL on top of Hadoop (see Hive, Impala). SQL queries are nearly always a lot simpler than comparable MapReduce code. (I find these efforts misguided, but separate issue.)",1386334075

It&#x27;s write once per segment. Once a segment is written, data is save and it&#x27;s (apart from disk corruption) impossible to corrupts, since the file is never opened for writing again. However, segments are not written immediately after a document is received - so when yanking the power cord right after a write to the cluster, you&#x27;ll loose data - however without any danger of corruption since the last, partially written segment is discarded. Couchdb behaves in a similar fashion: If the last bit of the storage file contains corrupt data, it is discarded. I&#x27;m not absolutely certain atm about the default durability settings in couch, so I can&#x27;t say if the write happens before or after the &quot;ack&quot; from the server. However, since disk controllers cheat and sometimes a &quot;flush&quot; to disk doesn&#x27;t actually flush, you can get data loss regardless of the promises your database makes.",1386331927

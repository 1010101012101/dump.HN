Fortunately, I had a great manager with whom I could talk freely on many subjects including this one. I had kind of &quot;rebelled&quot; once about the work-life balance. He did say one which stuck with me. There are cases where one might have to work extra:
1. Your own screw up (includes productivity)
2. Screw up by other teams which affects your work
3. Bad project management which includes unrealistic deadlines<p>The only thing that you can control is #1 by becoming more productive and more automation.<p>The #2 is interesting because it is a 2-way street i.e. there will times that someone else might have to work more because you or your team screwed up.<p>About #3 .. well there is nothing to be done Either endure or leave.",1422586724

Results in visually cleaner and more compact code, especially when dealing with large objects.<p>* Requiring backticks to do string interpolation seems like an ugly hack.<p>* CS uses dots to slice and splice ranges:<p><pre><code>    host?.split(&quot;.&quot;)[-1..][0] == &quot;dns&quot;
</code></pre>
BTW, notice in the example above two additional CS features that don&#x27;t exist in ES6:<p>* The existential operator `?` soaks up null/undefined references.<p>* `==` is compiled to `===`<p>* Expressions always return a value in CS, just like in Lisp, so no need to explicitly `return`<p>* Block strings and regular expressions.<p>And more: <a href=""http://coffeescript.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coffeescript.org/</a><p>Plus, CS just seems like it&#x27;s always a step ahead of JS. In using it, you can code in a more intelligently designed language that enforces best-practices better than JS does. Doing so supports diversity, innovations (after all, many of these ES6 features are obviously inspired by CS).<p>Why abandon such a wonderful language when it still has so much to offer, and at the same time seems to be driving innovation in JavaScript itself?",1422586423

8970218,comment,8969778,8970051,0,0,jessriedel,,,"The question of whether AI is dangerous in the hands of people with good intentions is more difficult than the one of whether it&#x27;s dangerous generally.  I was only trying to convince you of the former, in response to this:<p>> AGI will completely upend society by giving every human being access to practically infinite resources...But the idea that it is therefore &quot;dangerous&quot;, is nothing but a pre-theoretic misunderstanding of very complicated machinery.<p>But to get at the harder question, I think you misunderstand the paperclip story.  It&#x27;s <i>not</i> supposed to be an general argument for the danger of AI, and the danger is not that people will design a machine which can be easily predicted to fail. The danger is that they will design one that fails for reasons they did not foresee, and the point of the paperclip story is just to illustrate that the simplicity and mundaneness of the goals you give a goal-driven AGI doesn&#x27;t bound how bad the impact can be.  This arises because of the monumental shift between (1) telling a machine explicitly what to do and (2) telling a machine what you want.<p>The paperclip example is used <i>because</i> we can understand both the goal (paperclips) and the action that produces the goal (grab atoms, build paperclip factories).  Whats fundamentally different about an advanced goal-driven AGI arising from recursive self-improvement is that, for sufficiently difficult goals, you won&#x27;t understand the actions.  Therefore you must get the goals right.<p>Now you can certainly dispute whether people will build a goal-driven AGI (e.g. something that has an explicit utility function) rather than something else, but that&#x27;s really an empirical question about the choices of the designers and, more importantly, what the easiest way to get an AI to recursively self-improve is.<p>EDIT: Also, have you read the book?  I think it has flaws, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t contain &quot;the _most absurd_ arguments&quot; so I&#x27;m just afraid you might be misled.",1422586201

These are all calculations we aren&#x27;t conscious of, but when we create a database that can accept a million connections a second, and route them all, we&#x27;re thinking &quot;wow, we did great.&quot;  What I think is that the brain processed all those signals from literally millons of sensors, in a smaller chunk of chemicals, while having a layer on top of those autonomic functions that allows for complex communication.

For very restrictive subsets of self-modifying code that can preserve invariants it&#x27;s not clear if it can be powerful enough to allow the required level of self-introspection and self-improvement.

Instead of just checking in changes, maybe fork or branch it, do the work, and far more importantly, document what you did. Then tell the company you&#x27;d like to talk about this project and talk about what you have learned, and how you are working on self improvement. I don&#x27;t care if somebody doesn&#x27;t know something; I do care whether they have the drive to learn, because this job is often drinking from a fire hose. Also, I&#x27;d be very impressed with somebody who is thinking about things like how to best present themselves, that take initiative to try to solve my problems, where the problem in this case is how do I accurately measure this person in a short time period.

Even in a very conservative and best case scenario, the world would completely change when we can have computers do everything we can do now.<p>However it will very likely be much crazier than that. Imagine minds hundreds of thousands of times more intelligent than the best humans. They will be able to design technologies we can&#x27;t even conceive of. They will hack computers better than the best human hackers. They will be able to manipulate people better than any human manipulator.<p>The idea that we will be able to keep these things under control is just absurd. They will get whatever they want. And making what they want compatible with what we want is an incredibly hard problem: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/</a><p>A lot of people are guilty of anthropomorphizing AI. Assuming they will be just like really smart humans. And that they will just somehow develop human emotions and values like empathy. Or that if they do kill us, at least they will be something like us and so be like our (genocidal) descendants in some sense.<p>Have more imagination.

We could quite easily get something like a computable version of AIXI. AIXI has no consciousness, no emotions, nothing like humans. It&#x27;s just a mathematical function which calculates the best action.<p>Our current best AIs are essentially just approximations of it. Use some machine learning algorithm to fit a model of the world, and use it to predict what action will lead to the most &quot;reward&quot;. We keep making better and better learning algorithms. It&#x27;s the entire goal of the field of AI. There is a huge economic incentive to do so.<p>But no one is interested in making better utility functions. As long as they make better predictions or get higher scores in a video game, who cares? Wait until you are the scorer in the &quot;game&quot; and the AI tries to exploit you.",1422583521

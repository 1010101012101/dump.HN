These things are both directly counter to the jury instructions, which do not require prior art to be binary compatible and state damages should only basically fix the amount of money lost by the other company, not be extreme to make a point.

People have and do write code which is usable, and unchanged, in both major version, which seems to contradict your statement that doing so isn't possible. And people continue to work to make that easier, while also advancing Python as a language.<p>Your proposal, to be able to ""mix and match new and old code"", does not work. At least, not without a lot more development effort behind it. The object models are different enough to make it not work. Remember, Python 2 has both old-style and new-style classes, while Python 3 does not. There's Python 2 code which probably still depends on Python 2 old-style classes, and will break.

They can rewind your PC activity 10 minutes (or whatever) prior and see exactly all the steps you took for the error to occur.

4566487,comment,4563914,4563914,2,0,SolarNet,,,"This is why I hate all modern programming languages (I'm actually writing an article on that >.>). The conclusion to this article is the same as many others. Programming language feature X is better in situation A and Programming language feature Y is better in situation B. Where the features are often incompatible (or fulfill similar areas, error handling in this case). The solution is of course to have multiple programming languages in your projects that have both situation A and situation B<p>But languages are so annoying to integrate (where they can call into each other and support each other's features, without ridiculous glue code. Let alone swap code in the middle of a file), unless they were designed to (e.g. python and C). It is hell to set up the library dependencies and get the compilers to cooperate with each other. Which is why most just pick the language that's best for the majority of their project (or spend large amounts of developer time integrating other programming languages (not scripting languages, that's related but not quite the point) into their project).<p>Which is why we need the ability to change semantic languages within the same programming system, and have the programming system resolve the differences between the semantic languages automatically. So you can have one semantic language with features designed for situation A and another with features designed for situation B and just swap between them as needed and have them compile together automatically. This is what my Masters thesis and probably what my PhD dissertation will be on.",1348515221

Each outer sphere full of helium would contain a large inner sphere of hydrogen. The He would effectively insulate the H2 gas from atmosphere, reducing the fire hazard, while taking advantage of the superior lift provided by H2; to descend, they could simply vent hydrogen (via a valve out the top of the lift cell). Unfortunately the US helium export ban put paid to that plan, forcing them to use only hydrogen. The rest is history.<p>(Another key breakthrough in the early noughties (of the 20th century) was the invention of Blaugas -- a gaseous combustible fuel that was of neutral buoyancy in air. You could store fuel in gas cells and pump it straight to the engines without having to make any trim adjustments.)<p>Blimps -- non-rigid airships -- use concentric gas bags as well: there's an inner cell hidden within the outer lift cell that can be inflated or deflated with air to maintain internal pressure (keeping the outer bag taut but not over-pressurized) and regulate lift. But the ability to compress or liquify helium is indeed a valuable new technique that will reduce operating costs enormously for future airships.",1348514277

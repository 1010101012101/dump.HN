9388843,comment,9377951,9384458,0,0,_delirium,,,"On the last point, I think that&#x27;s a risk, but the dead-end can still be big enough to make a small company quite wealthy. For example one of the more successful niche-tech companies in Denmark makes a portal that many Danish doctor&#x27;s offices use. They did a good job really digging into how their market worked and what it wanted, so it&#x27;s very customized to the way Danish healthcare works. Although it has some benefits for patients too (if a doctor uses this portal, patients can book appointments online, etc.), the real selling point has been that they identified what administrative work produces a lot of the per-office overhead at small offices, and offload much of that, so the doctor saves more in administrative salaries than they pay for the PaaS. They also have a fairly &quot;high-touch&quot; sales process to convince doctors that their product really will help them out. This company is probably not going to grow outside of Denmark, but it makes a lot of money in Denmark (comparatively speaking), and its market is so specialized that it&#x27;s somewhat protected from external competitors.",1429199914

9388837,comment,9387929,9388513,0,0,harshreality,,,"They need to be able to stabilize the rocket&#x27;s landing in all sorts of conditions if they want to have any hope of landing it on another planet.  It&#x27;s not like interplanetary launches will be able to schedule launches to choose optimal weather conditions for the landing.  Maybe, if they&#x27;re lucky, they&#x27;ll be able to orbit briefly to avoid bad weather at the landing site, but moderate winds and wind gusts are going to be a problem.  If it&#x27;s impossible to reliably land under those conditions, the whole idea is flawed for the purposes of interplanetary flight.  You can&#x27;t have rockets going to Mars, and only have 50% or 75% surviving for relaunch.  That&#x27;s not the kind of cost reduction that will make interplanetary travel and resupply feasible.<p>It would obviously help with LEO launch costs, though, or any return landings on Earth.  Even if rocket stages are only recovered some of the time, and not reliably, that&#x27;s a significant cost savings and well worth doing.  It&#x27;s just that Musk is so intent on interplanetary travel driving all this technology.  If it&#x27;s only for cost savings for Earth landings, a parachute system or a specially designed (more accommodating) landing complex/barge could work too, right?<p>> (paraphrasing multiple comments) &quot;but this is to re-land rocket stages on Earth&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s an interview where he specifically talks about his long term goal of landing rocket stages on other planets. He says parachutes negatively affect reusability, I&#x27;m not sure how much of that is potential damage or off-site landing and how much is the necessity to reinstall a parachute for the next launch.  The point here is that he is clearly not thinking only of Earth landings in developing this technology.  I think some sort of assisted landing or more developed landing site could increase chance of recovery and reusability for Earth landings, decreasing total launch costs for Earth orbit missions, at the cost of not being applicable to landings on other planets.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOpmaLY9XdI?t=11m30s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOpmaLY9XdI?t=11m30s</a>",1429199858

He&#x27;s not wrong.  I can smell the jizz from the pants of the PR guy who coordinated this article with Observer.  Unless these new drugs are rigorously studies and their efficacy is independently verified, we&#x27;re going to be bombarded by all sorts of pseudo-drugs and supplements that are unregulated, untested and potentially dangerous.  You&#x27;re going to see marketing guys, PR men, and all sorts of phoneys trampling over themselves to get a piece of the nootropic action.

I was amazed by how well the touch instruments worked and how easily I could record riffs and flesh out small snippets of songs.  It ran almost flawlessly on the 4th gen Touch.<p>Next, I decided to buy an Android phone - a Motorola Droid 2. I was surprised to find that despite the power advantage over the iPod, none of he music apps I tried were usable. The drum programs, for instance, we&#x27;re so lacy and unpredictable as to be worse than useless. Hit a drum, and you may hear it seemingly instantly, maybe 1/8 a second later, maybe half a second, possibly never. Meanwhile the tiny iPod could play Garage Band instruments so well one could use it for live performance.<p>I upgraded my phone twice, first to a Droid X, then a Galaxy S3...

Using a 16MHz or 13.714MHz pixel clock would probably be more convenient for a 96MHz microcontroller.<p>Composite NTSC will create some interesting new challenges, though. I suspect the fact that some of your pixels are 6 cycles and some are 7 cycles will cause visible banding. It might be possible to eliminate this by taking your 14.318MHz source data and doing a proper band-limited resampling of it to 16MHz or 13.714MHz instead of the nearest-neighbor interpolation you&#x27;re essentially doing at the moment. You&#x27;d probably need an output DAC with more than 1 or 2 bits of dynamic range to do that, though. One of my pending projects is to do something very similar, generating composite output from a VGA card (pixel clock 14.161MHz).",1429197933

Only if the application can be guaranteed to receive interrupt service and/or thread timeslices at a 100 Hz rate or better is it possible to achieve audio latency of 10 milliseconds.  That&#x27;s a difficult thing to guarantee in a modern consumer OS.  It can be done, but it won&#x27;t happen by accident, only by design.<p>The penalty for failing to service your 10-ms buffer is a dropout that sounds much worse than slightly higher latency, so there&#x27;s an incentive to use larger buffers than necessary at every link in the signal chain.  From the point of view of the OS vendor, musicians might complain about latency, but everyone will complain about dropouts.",1429197586

You can turn on jack when you need it, turn it off when you don&#x27;t, and all of the pulseaudio stuff will get routed through it so that you don&#x27;t lose sound from your other applications.

An estimated 1,517 lethal accidents occurred with lawn mowers through the years 1997 to 2010. It is reasonable to assume that many of these injuries and deaths would not occur if consumers used a robotic mower. More than 17 million gallons of fuel, mostly gasoline, are spilled each year while refueling lawn equipment. Abattery poweredRLM will reduce emissions, gasoline spills, fires and other such accidents.”NRAO: “iRobot cited multiple statistics of grim accidents and spilt gasoline to assert the public benefit of approving its wireless robotic lawn mowers. However, there is already a competitive market for robotic lawn mowers using wire loops [buried edge wire], which has somehow failed to stanch the stream of ghastly accidents and spilt gasoline that iRobot associates with the mundane practice of lawn-mowing.”&quot;",1429197164

I&#x27;d done a number of real-time systems before, and written OS schedulers and NTP-like systems and so forth. A little audio work should be a walk in the park, right? A little manly-man programming from the wrist and we move on to <i>real</i> problems. So I walked into an audio project thinking that &quot;Oh, this latency and synchronization stuff, how bad could it really be?&quot;<p>Bad.<p>Nailing down buffer-bloat and sources of latency and jitter in an isochronous system took several months, the last few weeks of which were 80-100 hour weeks just before ship. Several times we thought we&#x27;d fixed the issues, only to find that our tests had been inadequate, or that some new component broke what we had built.<p>I remember nearly being in tears when I finally realized what the clock root of the audio system actually was, and that it wasn&#x27;t what people had been using. From there everything fell into place.<p>Don&#x27;t pull the number of buffers you have out of thin air (&quot;Oh, six is enough, maybe twelve, don&#x27;t want to run out in <i>my</i> layer of the system, after all...&quot;) Don&#x27;t assume your local underflow or overflow recovery strategy actually works in the whole system. Don&#x27;t assume your underlying &quot;real time&quot; hypervisor won&#x27;t screw you by halting the whole god damned system for 20ms while it mucks around with TLBs and physical pages and then resumes you saying, &quot;Have fun putting all the pieces of your pipeline back together, toodle-oo!&quot; Put debug taps and light-weight logging everywhere and attach them to tests. And know what your clock root is, or you will be sunk without a trace.<p>Isoch is hard.",1429196650

I can honestly say, you didn&#x27;t miss much.\nPsychiatrists are very expensive, and very few will accept your insurance.  They want cash.<p>Before I saw these people, I just believed they would help.\nI had no idea their were no magic pills.  In fact, I believe they have pills that were studied so terribly, they should be pulled of the market.<p>Your problems with anxiety popped off the page.  I too have battled crippling anxiety after a breakdown in grad school.  You will eventually find a Psychiatrist to prescribe benzodiazepines(usually a benzo with a long half life).  Yes, it works at first, but is addictive.  And--that doctor will want to see you for office visits.  See today, very few Psychiatrists do any real therapy.  They just basically prescribe, and drag patients on for office visits.  Legally they only need to see you once a year, but how are they going to make a living?  Oh, it&#x27;s always for your benefit though, and you will be paying for these visits.  In essence, you become a hostage to these drugs.<p>Real therapy?  Exactly what is real therapy.  I have no clue.  I went.  I cried.  I paid.  I felt just as bad afterwards.  When they did offer advice it was just not right, or right for a previous generation. (And yes, I tried CBT.)<p>Back to Psychiatrists, they don&#x27;t do therapy, unless you have money.  They basically see two to four patients an hour, and it basically just to charge for an office visit, to refill the medications they prescribe.  Medications that have a huge placebo component.  Medications that are addictive.  Yes, it&#x27;s quite a racket.<p>Psychologists are a bit different.  They can&#x27;t prescribe.  They can only offer talk therapy.  Yes, some are very nice, and well meaning.  The problem, I found, is they didn&#x27;t help me in the slightest.  Oh, that&#x27;s my fault!  I was only in therapy for one year, 2x a week, at $65 a visit.  I am ashamed how I came up with that money, but thought Therapy would save my life.<p>I could yak, on and on, but it&#x27;s one thing you should probally experience first hand.  It&#x27;s kinda like test driving a car an older sports car.  Some people will enjoy the experience.  Others will wonder what all the fuss is all about.  Bad analogy--just tired!<p>I&#x27;m not giving advice.  I&#x27;m just dissalusioned with the system.  I&#x27;ve been on a prescribed, addictive drug for years.  \nI&#x27;m trying to get off, but don&#x27;t want to push it.  Basically, I don&#x27;t know how healthy I am.  I don&#x27;t want to die in a crappy detox, praying to a higher power, because I can&#x27;t find a psychiatrist/doctor to refill my prescriptions.  I have a feeling my doctor is getting ready to retire.  I don&#x27;t want to start over with a new psychiatrist who&#x27;s dragging me on for an office visit every eight weeks, and charging me Whatever he/she wants.  See, I&#x27;m a different person than I was years ago.  I don&#x27;t have the same fears/problems.  I know what most psychiatrists are about to say before they say it.  I don&#x27;t have any big questions that need an answer.  I don&#x27;t need to cry.  I just need my prescriptions refilled.  That&#x27;s it.<p>As to &quot;Let&#x27;s look into getting you off these medications?&quot;  If you&#x27;re young, and healthy it&#x27;s fine! If older--it&#x27;s a crap shoot.  Some of the compassionate doctors will taper you off the prescribed drugs, but you have bathed your brain in a medication for years.  What do you think the outcome will be?",1454272884

As early humans started cooking and processing our food, we made fewer demands upon our teeth, which started shrinking as a result. They gradually retracted into the face, while the part of the lower jaw that held them did not (or, at least, did so more slowly). Hence: chin.<p>> Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, who coined the concept of evolutionary spandrels, liked this hypothesis. So does Nathan Holton from the University of Iowa, who studies facial evolution. “It seems that the appearance of the chin itself is probably related to patterns of facial reduction in humans during the Pleistocene,” he says. “In this sense, understanding why faces became smaller is important to explaining why we have chins.”<p>> “But why did the lower border of the jaw also not shrink?” Pampush asks.<p>It then elaborates on the diversity of hypotheses:<p>> It may seem frustrating to have so many imperfect competing hypotheses, but that&#x27;s part of the joy of chins: They reveal something about how scientists think about evolution. Some see the sculpting power of natural selection in everything, and view chins as surely some kind of adaptation. Others see natural selection as just one of many evolutionary forces, and so gravitate towards a spandrel-based explanation. “The chin is one of these rare phenomena in evolutionary biology that really exposes the deep philosophical differences between researchers in the field,” says Pampush.",1454271613

It&#x27;s none of you business, but I take an SSRI and do cognitive behavioral therapy for OCD. The behavioral therapy is for learning and developing good habits and the medication helps prevent intrusive and obsessive thoughts. Nobody is &quot;thinking for me&quot; (It saddens me that this is the prejudice you have). These professionals help me help myself, by giving me tools, information, and guidelines I would not have access to otherwise.<p>A college-level course on object oriented programming isn&#x27;t going to magically make you a good Java developer, but it may help you learn in a more sophisticated way than a self-taught curriculum. Either way, you wouldn&#x27;t shame someone for &quot;not helping themselves&quot; or &quot;taking the easy way out&quot; by enrolling in such a course.",1454270638

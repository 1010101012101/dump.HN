Although I&#x27;m curious how that paywall is working out, I doubt it&#x27;s doing very well. Many visitors have probably replaced Pando with content from elsewhere already. I wonder why a publisher won&#x27;t innovate with advertisers instead of users - create static, non-tracking, unintrusive ads and tell advertisers that they are protecting the user experience instead of selling out access to their visitor&#x27;s metadata and profiles. Sell that to advertisers until they get their heads out of the sand.  No, I won&#x27;t ask someone for a Pando link, support the paywall approach or share Pando content with others. I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;m an acceptable loss for their bottom line - at least for now.",1436655460
9871885,comment,9870029,9870941,0,0,derpderpdrep,,,"The difference between philosophy you read because you want to be well read in philosophy, and philosophy you understand because you&#x27;ve lived it and perhaps come to similar conclusions yourself, is vast. Philosophy, especially of the modern era (not including the last 20 years or so), is mostly limited to the individual (existentialist sort of stuff).<p>You create technology that links people together in a myriad of confusing and obtuse, symbolic, mush of ways, treating link between person to person like it is an identifiable, atomic thing (of which a computer has limited understanding of compared to that of someone who is socially affluent), that seems to make &#x27;okay&#x27; sense just because nothing better has replaced that &#x27;yet&#x27;. Then after this is done, you don&#x27;t expect the academic world philosophy to go completely nuts for a brief period in time?<p>In colleges we educate on philosophy but to most students that are brought into the classical philosophers, they haven&#x27;t had the kind of living experience for philosophy to make sense to them, and those that stick with it find themselves in a world that is fundamentally separate and distinct, from the ones that Locke, Hegel and Heidegger wrote about (or not, but it&#x27;s different enough to make you a little kooky).<p>There&#x27;s more connectivity in theory and reason between the stuff that computer scientists dream up, and the stuff that post modernists seemingly automate as of logical consequence, than is capable of being seen. I&#x27;m a computer scientist and an artist, and I know it&#x27;s not as simple as calling one field crap and the other field correct, when I find myself often standing in the middle of a storm. I&#x27;ve read some post modern philosophy that makes a great deal more sense to me than some computer science literature, or developer superstition.<p>Logic can really fool you into believing there is a singular way to perceive the world with. And it&#x27;s tempting, because it just seems to prove itself correct, continuously, it creates a reduction in what is otherwise chaos made from white noise trying to perceive itself as anything besides white noise. But with that, I feel there is a great loss in individuality, creativity, freedom of thought itself. You can chase yourself in circles finding every logical and cognitive bias you may succumb to. Is that a reason to step on every misshapen and imperfect sappling before it can turn into a tree?",1436655460

For an example of the precise issue losing the type within a container causes, see this example[1] of where a Go developer was struggling with an issue that is non-existent when types are retained.<p>As for using an external tool to do &quot;template generation&quot;, XDoclet[2] did that well over a decade ago.

By having the ability to create a &quot;software singularity&quot; at any point by producing a null, everything will have to be _manually_ checked at the invocation site.  Just like what had to be done in C for decades.<p>Can you guarantee that everyone involved in the lifetime of a project will always use the same approach, have the same assumptions about how the behavioural contracts are fulfilled, and will _always_ check everything that needs to be ensured &quot;non-null&quot; at the call sites?<p>With option types[3], or even better with disjoint union types[4] where the type contains either an error _or_ the desired result, this simply isn&#x27;t a concern.  The developer _must_ deal with the possibility of maybe not getting something back from a call (or of getting an error _instead of_ the desired result).<p>1- <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20087233/golang-get-the-value-from-list-element"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20087233/golang-get-the-v...</a><p>2 - <a href=""http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net/xdoclet/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net/xdoclet/index.html</a><p>3 - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_type"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_type</a><p>4 - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union</a>",1436655408

9871872,comment,9870347,9870347,0,0,ender7,,,"If you, like me, or tptacek [1], were confused why this is a big deal, that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s common practice for online articles to be changed after they are published, especially as new information comes in. If the article originally contained factually incorrect information that was later corrected that would be one thing, but that&#x27;s not the case with this article; new information and context was added.<p>TechRaptor, the site that hosts the article, is strongly associated with the GamerGate community, and that is the source of this concern of this new non-existent &quot;danger&quot;. Standing up for &quot;ethical journalism&quot; was and continues to be one of GamerGate&#x27;s most popular smoke screens. In this case, the NYT article was modified to include context that TechRaptor author didn&#x27;t like. However, it doesn&#x27;t look good to say &quot;no, this totally wasn&#x27;t about the fact that Ellen Pao was a woman&quot; because that&#x27;s easily disprovable: there are a trillion and a half Reddit threads out there displaying some of the nastiest sexist invective you&#x27;ve seen in a long time, all targeted at Ellen Pao. Instead, TechRaptor attempts to attack the article via a sidechannel discreditation. It attacks an unrelated feature of the article (that it was modified after it was published), which casts a pall over the entire thing, effectively undermining the main argument simply by association.<p>There is a ton of talk in this discussion thread about how the NYT article is &quot;biased&quot; or trying to present an &quot;opinion&quot;. This seems to me like just another way of disagreeing with the argument without seeming like you&#x27;re disagreeing with it. Claiming that this should be reported on like any other CEO being fired is not a cry for journalistic integrity, it&#x27;s a request to willfully ignore the very, very special context that this firing took place in. The behavior of the Reddit community during this process, a behavior that was blatantly sexist and clearly occurred at an outsized volume and level of rancor <i>because Ellen Pao was a woman</i>, cannot and should not be ignored. To do so would be, well, unethical.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/edit?id=9870891"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/edit?id=9870891</a>",1436655169

Here&#x27;s your first point:<p>>1. <i>Pao is a hero to many online for her gender equality fight, but was ousted by people online as well.</i> This is mostly beyond dispute, except for the presumption that the Reddit mob actually did oust her, which all the principals in the story deny. That interpretation favors the Reddit mob.<p>Who is she a hero to? How many is &quot;many&quot;? What evidence do they have of this statement? Is she actually fighting for gender equality? You were also right to question whether the &#x27;crowd&#x27; (the current wording) is the cause of her ouster, but it is also worth asking just who is to be included in that group, and whether they can legitimately be thought of as a single coherent entity.<p>That&#x27;s just one sentence. Your second point:<p>>2. <i>Pao&#x27;s resignation was abrupt and happened amidst a torrent of misogynist drama, renewing concerns about SV sexism.</i> It&#x27;s indisputable that her resignation was abrupt. It&#x27;s indisputable that the story has generated concern about online sexism. Some people may not appreciate that concern, but that doesn&#x27;t make its existence not a fact.<p>We can split hairs about what is meant by &quot;abrupt resignation&quot;, but the community has been unhappy for quite some time. The change.org petition has been around for about a month. &quot;happened amidst a torrent of misogynist drama&quot; is a phrase nearly without empirical meaning. Certainly there was &quot;drama&quot; involved, as with any other significant occurrence, but one must ask to what extent was &quot;misogyny&quot; involved, how was that relevant, and what criteria do they use to qualify that term. And of course, &quot;renewing&quot; what &quot;concerns&quot; to whom?<p>One can continue down your list in a similar fashion.<p>Furthermore, the context is certainly manufactured. Pao is famous for her lawsuit, and as a consequence gets associated with &quot;sexism in tech&quot;. Ironically, while the outcome of the lawsuit determined that she had not suffered gender discrimination, any news about her now assumes as context a narrative that she is the victim of sexism.<p>The new sexism angle is a red herring, and the article is worse off for it.",1436654957

I&#x27;ve lived in several european countries, each with strikingly different styles of media, and none of them are as shockingly <i>bad</i> as the american media.<p>Just like Pepsi and Coke, there&#x27;s a symbiotic relationship between various media outlets where &quot;rivalry&quot; just helps drive the views up. Instead of having a handful of neutral stations where the reader can do their own research and form their own opinion (something which most readers are not interested in doing anyway), they divide their readership in camps, willingly driving away one camp while cultivating a soundproof echo chamber for the other.

It has everything I look for in a password manager, even without any updates or changes since it&#x27;s been open sourced.<p>On a different note, even though I&#x27;d pay to use it, after following the Google Group pretty closely, it seems like Mitro has been unable to foster any sort of development community in the short time the project has been open source.

It seems that they&#x27;re shutting it down primarily because of lack of development interest, including lack of interest from the original creators. It could be naturally assumed that they were &quot;expecting&quot; a community to form around Mitro, and embrace the open sourceness of it, but that obviously didn&#x27;t happen.

It was soon obvious to many that the sale had been premature, the site was unmanaged and under-resourced under the old-media giant who simply didn&#x27;t understand it and could never realize its full potential, so the founders and their allies in Y-Combinator (where reddit had been born) hatched an audacious plan to re-extract reddit from the clutches of the 100-year-old media conglomerate.<p>> Together with Sam Altman, they recruited a young up-and-coming technology manager with social media credentials. Alexis, who was on the interview panel for the new reddit CEO, would reject all other candidates except this one. The manager was to insist as a condition of taking the job that Conde Nast would have to give up significant ownership of the company, first to employees by justifying the need for equity to be able to hire top talent, bringing in Silicon Valley insiders to help run the company. After continuing to grow the company, he would then further dilute Conde Nast&#x27;s ownership by raising money from a syndicate of Silicon Valley investors led by Sam Altman, now the President of Y-Combinator itself, who in the process would take a seat on the board.<p>> Once this was done, he and his team would manufacture a series of otherwise-improbable leadership crises, forcing the new board to scramble to find a new CEO, allowing Altman to use his position on the board to advocate for the re-introduction of the old founders, installing them on the board and as CEO, thus returning the company to their control and relegating Conde Nast to a position as minority shareholder.<p>> JUST KIDDING.

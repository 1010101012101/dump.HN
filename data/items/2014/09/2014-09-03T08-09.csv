And I&#x27;m from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, generally considered a pretty open-minded, progressive, tolerant and caring place. My friends are educated, middle-class. They&#x27;re caring and generous to friends and family and have disposable income.<p>But they&#x27;re extremely hesitant to something even like Kiva - a charity which allows you to lend money to business projects, and actually get your money back. I&#x27;ve lent thousands and got all of it back and relent it over and over again. Worst case is you miss out on $0.10 a month in interest while putting  $100 to work charitably, infinitely, in a way that can&#x27;t in any way be described a handout, as going to corrupt governors, as creating  a relationship of dependence or be used to buy drugs.<p>But they really don&#x27;t give a fuck. Trust me. May not be the case for everyone, buy my very generous friends are only generous to the people they know and love. Outside of that, they don&#x27;t give a shit.<p>> That&#x27;s blatantly untrue.<p>I disagree. The numbers are clear. About 5 thousand people die each day from <i>preventable</i> causes, such as a lack of clean drinking water. That&#x27;s 9/11 every single day, completely preventable, mostly children.<p>On that statistic, here&#x27;s a quote<p>> It is estimated that it would cost about US$ 23 billion per year to achieve the international development target of halving the percentage of people unserved with improved water sources globally (currently at 18%) and improved sanitation services (currently at 40%) by the year 2015. But governments presently spend US$ 16 billion a year in building new infrastructure. The additional US$ 7 billion a year needed to supply good water and sanitation to some who lack it is less than one tenth of what Europe spends on alcoholic drinks each year, about the same as Europe spends on ice cream and half of what the United States spends each year on pet food. Compared to what governments expend on military weapons, the cost of providing people with the means to improve their health is small.<p>Yes, one country spends twice as much on our pets than is necessary to spend to worldwide solve one of the biggest tragedies the world knows, that kids die each day from entirely preventable trivial issues like diarrhea. That&#x27;s why the whole ice bucket challenge rubbed some people the wrong way, because it was one big tragic joke that was hard to criticize because at the end of the day, it did raise money that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be raised.<p>These quick notes are but the tip of the iceberg. There&#x27;s a lot of data and we can do a lot more with very little, but people don&#x27;t care, and don&#x27;t seem to care enough to know or consider to change their mind, either.",1409734611

[I don&#x27;t know the generally accepted figure, but I&#x27;d say anything with headways of greater than 10 minutes or so is not suitable for just-turn-up-and-go usage.]<p>Obviously frequent service is good, but there&#x27;s a large variety of lines and sometimes very frequent service isn&#x27;t warranted (or isn&#x27;t possible because of funding/politics/etc).<p>For a line with non-frequent service, &quot;just look at your smartphone&quot; isn&#x27;t a good solution, as (1) not everybody has a smartphone available, so it&#x27;s a bad idea to make a transit service that requires one for decent service, and (2) more importantly, in many cases with less frequent lines not being able to plan can be a significant burden, especially when you need to make transfers along the way (in which case you always have to assume the worst case, and all the required uncertainty padding quickly adds up).<p>So for user convenience either you want frequent service, so planning isn&#x27;t needed, or you want scheduling that&#x27;s at least a little accurate, so planning is <i>possible</i> when necessary.<p>[There are also technical reasons for scheduling even very frequent trains in some cases, because when trains become frequent enough, the line itself can become a bottleneck, especially with complex services.  For instance on many lines in Tokyo, both ordinary, express, and limited-express trains share the same tracks, with the expresses using in-station bypass tracks to overtake the non-expresses.  The track network is also in many cases very non-linear, with many different lines sharing portions of tracks in some places, and different operators running onto each others&#x27; tracks.  To do all this with high frequency services requires a delicate timing dance, and if you screw up the timing beyond some point, the whole thing very quickly falls apart.]",1409733408

It&#x27;s <i>wonderful</i>, and like you say, you just don&#x27;t care. Go to platform, board a train. Time-to-trains are acceptably low that you can go an wait. (looking at a random T schedule, if you arrive on the platform randomly, it&#x27;s ~2-5 minutes wait on average if things are on schedule.)<p>That&#x27;s not CalTrain. Trains are not as frequent (they I transit daily from Mountain View to SF: during the morning rush from 7-9am, trains are anywhere from 7 minutes to 34 minutes apart.) Missing a train also doesn&#x27;t just mean the time waiting for the next train, but also lost time due to the train itself. (For example, the 8:05 is 7 minutes behind the 7:57 in Mountain View, but 15 behind in SF.)<p>Exceptional delays are significant, and not that exceptional. Trains hit things, catch up to other trains and follow them at a snail&#x27;s pace, break down, stop for blocked tracks, can&#x27;t be boarded due to overcrowding, departed early due to being &quot;full&quot;, or are just missing without cause.<p>That said, if there was good data that just told me when trains would leave and when they would arrive, that&#x27;d be nice. I don&#x27;t know of such a thing, and given the article, what exists looks clunky, complicated, and incorrect.<p>> Why should a transportation authority move heaven and earth to satisfy some moralistic concern about keeping exactly to schedules?<p>Because you&#x27;re wasting people&#x27;s time?",1409732800

I just disagreed with the notion that their funding could be cut off this easily - even if Google retracted I&#x27;m sure they could reach some agreement with Facebook for example.<p>I still hope Mozilla is investing the money wisely, because this arrangement is temporary in any case.

8261957,comment,8260498,8261569,2,0,quaunaut,,,"Part of the issue there is that Golang doesn&#x27;t have any mature ORM-type packages. The one I&#x27;ve heard the most about is [Gorp](<a href=""https://github.com/coopernurse/gorp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/coopernurse/gorp</a>), but none of the current Golang web libraries really sanction anything- but that&#x27;s part of Go&#x27;s nature. Go by default doesn&#x27;t encourage big frameworks. It encourages you to use the rather well-built standard libraries to get most things done, and do the rest of the augmentation yourself.<p>However, as it&#x27;s being looked at more and more as a great systems language, people are building bigger, more frameworky systems in it all the time, and as a result it&#x27;s getting friendlier. It&#x27;s going to be chaotic no matter what for the next year, but that&#x27;s how new languages, especially popular ones, are. If you&#x27;re looking for easy choices, it might be better to wait for now. If you want to get your hands dirty, I guarantee you&#x27;ll find something you want if you keep looking, or you&#x27;ll get good enough to run with it yourself.<p>(Just be sure you know your web basics to do webdev on it, as no one is going to hold your hand in Goland.)",1409731524

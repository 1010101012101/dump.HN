537388,comment,537303,537306,0,0,etal,,,"As a PhD student, I get criticism for taking on tasks that are short, useful and possibly clever, but not novel. If it can't go into a published paper, it's a waste of time, apparently.<p>And really, there are so many minor improvements that can be made in academic life -- like maintaining the public web server for an app or database you published a paper about, or getting source code documented and ready for release -- that if you take all of them on as they appear, you'll have almost no time for writing papers, grants and a dissertation. PhD students are trained to neglect the simple stuff in order to get through school.<p>So I can see how a PhD dropout could be positive. The best coworkers are the ones that can either prioritize and take care of the simple stuff so quickly that it's not a problem, or can switch back into ""get things done"" mode when it's needed.",1238338597
537387,comment,536947,537130,0,0,ramchip,,,"It's decent, but I switched to Qt when the licensing changed and definitely do not regret it. YMMV, but I find it the most pleasant and complete GUI toolkit of any language. wxWidgets makes you do more stuff manually. For example, I've found sending custom events to be a fairly complex and error-prone process, requiring badly-documented macros, while Qt makes it a breeze with the signals/slots mechanism. Qt also offers much better integration with VS, eclipse, etc. wxWidgets does have a fairly usable stand-alone designer.<p>I don't know about dabo, but having used both toolkits, and now that Qt is LGPL, I don't see any serious reason for choosing wxWidgets over Qt. Personally I use it from C++, but if you want Python I'd suggest having a look at <a href=""http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt</a> .",1238338544

Which is one reason Google works so very hard at the competitive advantages it <i>can</i> build, such as PR, patents, tools (gmail, docs, maps), and improving search.<p>All you need is better search. Is that possible? Google would like you to leave that research to them, with all their money, experience and PhD's, what's the point in trying? Surely there are better prospects anywhere but there? <i>This</i> is one of Google's competitive advantages.

537378,comment,535212,536833,0,0,time_management,,,"In my experience, it was about 1/3. Then again, I wasn't a great player.<p>In 2003, I came up with a Magic-like game that solved a lot of these problems. It wasn't a kill-your-opponent game, but a German-style TCG with a Victory Point (VP) system, making it more amenable to multiplayer games. There were no ""life points"", but you had Action and Focus points that you could use to draw extra cards or resources, to give creatures an advantage in combat (making it more nondeterministic), etc. The number of strategic options per turn was vastly greater than in Magic, so it was harder for a player to get ""stuck"" and unable to do something useful.<p>Unfortunately, at the time I knew nothing about programming, nor had any money (I was 20). It was pretty obvious that the only way the game had a shot would be to take it online. Now I could hack it up, but I've forgotten most of the mechanics.<p>The disadvantage of this game, and why I think it wouldn't have ever taken off the way M:tG did is that, despite having ""better"" design from a Euro-style perspective, it wasn't a game that would finish within 30 minutes. A turn involved multiple players (most phases of turns were concurrent) and had a lot more strategic options than Magic's ""untap, draw, cast, attack"" formula that describes 90% of turns, so a single turn would last 3-10 minutes.",1238337989

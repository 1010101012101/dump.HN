449976,comment,449457,449620,0,0,azanar,,,">I think the optimal strategy is to pick something you enjoy but that can pay the bills. Most people could probably enjoy multiple professions. Choose the one you would enjoy that pays the best.<p>I think this is pretty good advice, but with a caveat. Enjoyment is not just a boolean function, but varies from unbelievably painful to completely enjoyable. I think is more of a two-dimensional optimization problem than a simple matter of picking the maximal paying element from the column named 'fun and interesting'. Doing java development at a large company and doing python development at a small company would both rank 'fun and interesting' relative to the rest of the total set of available professions, but I would still seriously consider the python position, even though the java position is bound to pay a lot better on average. But maybe you meant that, and I am just misreading.",1232941424
449975,comment,449230,449230,0,0,mdipierro,,,"Before investing time in learning a new language you may want to consider other ""features"" of a web framework that may help you choose. For example, give a try to web2py since it does not require installation (just unzip and starts). It includes sqlite and ssl enabled web server. You can do all development and maintenance via the web interface. In 5 minutes you should be able to write a simple app like:<p><pre><code>    def hello(): return ""Hello %s"" % request.vars.name\n</code></pre>\nThen you decide if it is worth your time to learn the language. Usually learning the APIs of a framework take more time than learning the language it is based on.",1232941411

449951,comment,449457,449784,0,0,azanar,,,"This is quite an assertion. To make sure I'm getting this right, I can't be happy without money to buy my happiness, and if I ever believe I can, I am simply giving into the group-think that the upper class has foisted upon me. Either I'm driven by the insatiable desire for money, or I am a cog of the bourgeoisie?<p>I think this is complete crap. The most unhappy person I can think of right now doesn't buy into the money is evil philosophy; quite the opposite in fact. The problem he has is that he doesn't know what he wants, so he is defaulting to money as an indication of wealth. And I can think of a number of people I know who are happy, but aren't particularly high on the social ladder, <i>nor do they really want to be</i>. What they consider wealth right now -- their children, and time to work on their hobbies -- is something they can't trade for on the open market. Please keep this in mind: wealth is <i>not</i> the same thing as money. Wealth is what you want, money is simply one means, but not the only one, of getting what you want. For those who don't know what they want, it seems that they default to treating money as an end, rather than as a means.<p>To be clear, I'm not arguing the opposite of your claim, I am arguing that the desire money is not good or evil; it is neutral. The real question of motives becomes where that money will be spent, or if not to be spent, why it is being hoarded. If hoarded only as a metaphorical yard stick of worthiness to the people supposedly oppressing the rest of us, it seems like a waste of time. If it gets you the things you need to make you happier, then it isn't a waste of time.",1232939643

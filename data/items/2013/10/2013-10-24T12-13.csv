What about when you&#x27;re debugging and something just isn&#x27;t working the way you expect because you&#x27;ve unknowingly stepped outside that subset?  (Most of the important concepts here aren&#x27;t syntactic constructions you can avoid trivially by typing Y instead of X, and may or may not be detectable statically).  Also, maybe you&#x27;re missing opportunities to better insure your code is correct at compile time - I&#x27;m not sure whether it falls within your subset, but for instance I recently put together a macro that asserts statically that two expressions have the same type (and without any runtime cost).<p><i>&quot;I&#x27;ve also seen some C &#x27;experts&#x27; fail to come to a proper solution even if they know all the features.&quot;</i><p>Obviously.

Electrical bicycles can indeed be deceptive, as in you see an elderly lady zipping by whilst slowly pedaling (usually the elderly ladies are only barely faster on bike than on foot), and since they don&#x27;t make extra noises they can be a bit dangerous if you don&#x27;t look out.<p>But it&#x27;s still just an assisted bicycle. Before electrical bikes, we had assisted bicycles with a small two-stroke combustion engine, the Spartamet [0]. These were iirc registered in a separate category, &#x27;snorfietsen&#x27;, which is a class lower than mopeds (TIL those would be called &#x27;mopas&#x27;) [1], or basically, &#x27;assisted bicycles&#x27;.

But your variables/objects should go on the stack unless you have a reason not to put them there.  As the slide suggests, if you need a lot of stuff on the heap, a standard std::vector will often do.<p>In C, it can be tricky to ensure that every <i>malloc</i> has a matching <i>free</i> and every <i>fopen</i> has a matching <i>fclose</i> etc.  This style of resource management is error-prone, but it comes with the C territory.<p>Java throws its hands up in the air in disgust and basically accepts that you will generate a lot of garbage.  Then it slaps a mandatory garbage collector on top to clean everything up, which I guess is an okay way to deal with memory, but it sucks for other resources that aren&#x27;t managed by the garbage collector.<p>C++, on the other hand, makes it easy to write garbage-free code.  But it&#x27;s only easy if you avoid using <i>new</i> or similar functions that allocate resources such as file descriptors, locks, network sockets etc.<p>If you see people using &quot;new&quot;, there&#x27;s a good chance they&#x27;re misguided C or Java programmers.<p>C programmers often think they should use <i>new/delete</i> as often as they used <i>malloc/free</i> in C.  Java programmers sometimes try to use <i>new</i> every time they instantiate an object.  Java did steal the <i>new</i> keyword from C++, and it&#x27;s perfectly normal for Java code to be riddled with <i>new</i>&#x27;s because there&#x27;s no other way to do it in Java.

Stay positive. Negative thoughts make you perform worse. You have to believe in yourself and tell yourself that it&#x27;s okay if you miss something but fix it next time.
*Recognize what makes you unhappy and try to figure out why.
Beware of sappers, or people who don&#x27;t like to see others get ahead. They are the people that come around in an attempt to assert control over you during one of these activities. For instance, let&#x27;s say that someone sees you reading and then asks you to mow the lawn. Most people, to avoid argument, just go out and do what they are told, There are times however when that is a poor precedent to set. It says that whenever your task is enjoyment, anyone can come around and override that task. Not only can that lead to resentment, but it is also the beginning of habitual unhappiness.
&quot;Believe in yourself&quot;, entire books can be summed up in those words... The &quot;power of belief&quot;, or &quot;power of prayer&quot; or &quot;placebo effect&quot; are all words that have the same general meaning, and all can be scientifically demonstrated to have a real effect(positive or negative) on people&#x27;s lives. Basically it is using one&#x27;s imagination to manipulate oneself or the world around them, and the longer and more one believes something to be true the greater the effect and or likelihood. And also believe in others a little, allowing others to be free can sometimes free oneself.
Develop a non-defeatist attitude toward life, start looking at your life as you in control of everything, no matter how out of control your life truly is, pretend it&#x27;s all up to you, use your imagination... no one is controlling your destiny you make your own destiny you are the master of you life, and everything depends on you to praise or blame. It is very common for people to unknowingly develop a defeatist attitude toward life and give up or say things like &quot;it&#x27;s all in god&#x27;s hands&quot;, or it&#x27;s genetics, or it&#x27;s destiny, karma etc., or to have been belittled by others into believing there are things one can&#x27;t do, it is easier to assume a defeatist attitude based on bad, unlucky, or inaccurate experiences and subconsciously and automatically assume we can do nothing so why try in the future, this is a good way to save needless effort that we would perceive to be wasted based on our experiences, it is learning, and it saves time and energy if this is the attitude one wants.",1382617000

Antibiotics help reduce the infection to the point where your body can do the rest.<p>If the resistant bacteria are a small minority, taking antibiotics long enough to kill most of the non-resistant ones will let your body kill the remaining resistant ones.<p>If you stop too early, the battle tide has not yet turned. Instead, by killing, say, half the non-resistant ones, you&#x27;ve made the resistant ones a larger proportion of the whole infection. Then both groups continue to multiply.<p>If you repeat this several times, starting and stopping the antibiotics depending on how you feel, the resistant bacteria could go from being 1% of your infection to 50%.",1382616597

The six[0] library is a wrapper for making code compatible with both versions. There are tools like 2to3[1] and 3to2[2] that convert code from one version to another. They&#x27;re not perfect but do catch the most common differences. Such things help with making the change.<p>However it is the availability (or more exactly lack of) of famous and widely used libraries that hinder or speed up the adoption. For example, Django recently started offering a Python 3 version[0].

We had been brought up on the good stuff and nothing that came along subsequently was anywhere near as compelling. Even the licensed versions of Elite on other platforms were a pale imitation. Because of this I gave games a wide birth, probably until the Playstation came along a generation later.<p>What Bell and Braben were able to achieve was tantamount to magic in many areas. As explained in the article the 8 galaxies with 256 stars was quite amazing. We all knew there were only so many banks of 16K RAM so how was this possible?\nThe display was also quite incredible, even if you thought you knew a lot about the display modes. The top 3/4 was hi-resolution black and white and the lower dashboard was chunkier 4 colour. Swapping display mode mid-screen-refresh was truly out there.\nAs for the 3D graphics, there was no openGL back then. Anyone that has had a go with openGL knows it is hard enough as it is. Bell + Braben did 3D with no library and in pure assembly language, hidden line removal included.\nThe game may not have been networked however that was not a problem, there was plenty to talk about. This word of mouth aspect meant that a lot of Elite gameplay (such as the missions, getting stuck in hyperspace, mining asteroids and the consequences of trading in contraband) was part myth. There was no knowing what extent the gameplay really involved, friends could tell you things they found and you might not be able to find out for yourself.<p>There were plenty of other BBC micro games that were excellent, obviously not to the same degree as Elite, however, Elite did captivate a whole generation for months at a time. I wonder what the opportunity cost of this was.

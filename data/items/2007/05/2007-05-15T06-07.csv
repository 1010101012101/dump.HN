22149,comment,21974,22040,0,0,sbraford,,,"Yes, ""investors"" here is a bit broad.<p>Reading posts like this make it seem really pointless to spend too much time seeking investment.<p>Just go out and build a solid business.  Either:<p>A) It will work.  You will have profits and/or investors will be beating down your door.<p>B) It won't - you've run out of money and no one wants to invest in you.  Just give up!<p>Luckily there are angels and groups like YC who don't take the ""don't fund founder salaries"" approach.<p>For a small web 2.0 startup -- server costs are around $100-500 a month for even a modestly successful app.<p>What else are investors funding, if not founder salaries??",1179210175

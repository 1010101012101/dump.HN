7975874,comment,7974072,7975847,3,0,maest,,,"It would seem there is more demand than supply when it comes to Tor relays. If there were a safe, anonymous way to pay for using Tor relays (Torcoin?), then there would be a lot more incentives to have people run relays. That means the speed will be bumped up and at one point there will be an equilibrium between supply and demand. The system might also provide preferential treatment to users who are willing to pay more.<p>Discuss.",1404291572
7975873,comment,7974072,7975243,3,0,csandreasen,,,"You&#x27;re absolutely correct in that it is a trust issue.  However, when Comcast forwards my packets they have both a profit incentive to not go stealing my all of my credit card info (their customers would quickly take their business elsewhere) and a legal incentive (they&#x27;re a known entity inside the US - someone&#x27;s going to court).  With Tor, I&#x27;m putting all of my trust in someone likely on the other side of the globe who has only given me no more identifying information than an IP address and promises no more than that they&#x27;ll offer me free bandwidth.  That person could have set up shop a few hours ago and may be gone tomorrow.<p>And what if they did sslstrip your connection to your bank&#x27;s website?  Would Tor catch it if the exit node only did it for a week or two and only to .5% of the connections?  Would any of the victims be able to determine the source of the attack?  How many people on Tor actually keep track of what exit nodes their traffic is going through?",1404291546

(...) The closest he comes to a clear thesis statement is at the beginning &quot;Hackers and Painters&quot;:<p>&quot;Of all the different types of people I&#x27;ve known, hackers and painters are among the most alike. What hackers and painters have in common is that they&#x27;re both makers.&quot;<p>To which I&#x27;d add, what hackers and painters don&#x27;t have in common is everything else. The fatuousness of the parallel becomes obvious if you think for five seconds about what computer programmers and painters actually do:<p>Computer programmers cause a machine to perform a sequence of transformations on electronically stored data.<p>Painters apply colored goo to cloth using animal hairs tied to a stick.<p>It is true that both painters and programmers make things, just like a pastry chef makes a wedding cake, or a chicken makes an egg. But nothing about what they make, the purposes it serves, or how they go about doing it is in any way similar.<p>Start with purpose. With the exception of art software projects (which I don&#x27;t believe Graham has in mind here) all computer programs are designed to accomplish some kind of task. Even the most elegant of computer programs, in order to be considered a program, has to compile and run [1]. So just like mechanical engineers and architects, computer programmers create artifacts that have to stand up to an objective reality. No one cares how pretty the code is if the program won&#x27;t work.<p>The only objective constraint a painter has is making sure the paint physically stays on the canvas (something that has proven surprisingly challenging). Everything beyond that is aesthetics - arranging colored blobs in a way that best tickles the mind of the viewer.<p>This difference is what makes programming so similar to engineering, which also tries to create beautiful things in the face of objective constraints, but it&#x27;s a parallel that really rankles Graham.<p><a href=""http://www.idlewords.com/2005/04/dabblers_and_blowhards.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.idlewords.com/2005/04/dabblers_and_blowhards.htm</a><p>= = =",1404291327

Statistically there is much less than a fraction of a percent of that occurring by chance alone, so being suspicious is absolutely justified.<p>But a dice is the antithesis of human behavior. The example I was talking about was almost completely subjective in nature and with 5 samples from an (assumingly) untrained observer (given he/she was a reporter, not a clinical researcher) leads to a whole lot of observation/experimenter bias.<p>So while my original if n=5, reject may not have been 100% accurate, in the case of human behavioral analyses, I stand by it.",1404291307

Not big deal really, as it was only advertised for about 14 hours before I noticed and disabled it. It was only after a few weeks when my girlfriend was complaining she kept getting messages from websites refusing to show her content on the basis that she was connecting over the Tor network (which she wasn&#x27;t) that I realised my home IP was blacklisted, and it took a while for me to get a new lease and IP.<p>I&#x27;m not telling people to not run exit nodes, but people shouldn&#x27;t just go and spin up a Tor relay with default settings, because it will by default run as an exit node, and depending on the hosting provider, this may or may not be an issue.",1404291244

7975817,comment,7965759,7974294,1,0,mrow84,,,"What you&#x27;ve said sounds very reasonable to me. I find it interesting that the line of reasoning you have presented doesn&#x27;t appear to require super-fast trading. That there has been an &quot;arms race&quot; to become faster and faster fits perfectly, because the competition is over who is the fastest market maker. Given that the skill of people/firms engaged in that race has been to be as fast and smart as possible, it also makes sense that they would be less than enthusiastic about any limitation on their competitive abilities. Neither of those points, however, implies that being able to trade as quickly as possible is actually &quot;useful&quot; to the wider market - only that it is a consequence of that market.<p>It seems possible that there is a lot of effort being put into that endeavour that is, in some sense, wasted - it is spent on competition rather than &quot;production&quot;, and with a judicious rule change the cost of competition could be reduced. The inevitable free market counter-argument is that the market will have already selected the best balance of cost/benefit, but I don&#x27;t find that convincing at all, even if only because obtaining a sufficiently free market is impossible.<p>Anyway, thanks for your response, it certainly seems (to a layman such as myself at least) to be a good description of the basis for HFT.",1404290048

7975749,comment,7971354,7971354,1,0,sytelus,,,"The problem with Go is that it wasn&#x27;t designed to implement any large projects like C was. So the designers would typically make trade offs on perceived beauty and elegance rather than utility and potential pain in the real world. Another side effect of this is optimizing for compiler simplicity rather than optimizing for expressiveness of the language. It&#x27;s easy to forget we build compilers not for compiler&#x27;s sake but for its target user. Here&#x27;s the quote from Go&#x27;s history:<p><i>we started off with the idea that all three of us had to be talked into every feature in the language, so there was no extraneous garbage put into the language for any reason.</i><p>I would also argue C++ started in similar fashion but it went exact opposite route. The balance between minimalism and feature creep can only be achieved if you are designing language as a side effect of building your own large scale project combined with a sense of urgency.<p>Go is currently a lucky language. There is a huge vacuum that Java has left after Oracle acquisition plus its prolonged stagnation. People who need compiled languages for their relatively new code base, Go would end up becoming their choice regardless of its shortcomings. People will enjoy its minimalism until code base grows to be monster and features starts becoming sorely missed. This is nothing unusual in world of programming languages. We have seen COBOL become a gold standard at one point and PHP is still pretty hot.",1404288421

Millions of users lost their home security and surveillance systems instantly due to this ill-advised decision.\nWe should hold the federal government and Microsoft directly responsible for any losses that happened today, and any that happen in the future as a result of any such action.\nWe might as well go ahead with emotional damages for causing the concern in the first place.",1404288271

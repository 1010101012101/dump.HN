Yeah, there are a huge number of people who &quot;believe&quot; it.<p>It has historical relevance, the influence of the church throughout history not the stories in the Bible.  AKA Inquisition, influence on the Monarchies, crusades, etc.<p>It has a huge base of believers who listen to a clergy man every Sunday and some (not all) take to heart what he has to say, this is passed down from the head of the church (the pope and cardinals).<p>It has huge political sway.  Just like the revelations that Snowden did.<p>In contrast, Snowden revealed something of great importance to the First World (which is probably why you are all fired up about it).  He pointed out something that really could be disastrous for our nation.  However, the adoption and acceptance of Homosexuals in the third world is also important and Francis could have an affect on that.<p>>There&#x27;s about 2 billion Christians. And about 6 billion cellphone subscriptions.<p>And if the poles are to be believed only 50% of Americans care about this.  I can guarantee you there are less Bolivians and Haitians (who have cell phones too) that give a crap about NSA Surveillance.  Rest assured, I&#x27;m in the percentage that cares, but I&#x27;m also not going to write off the contributions of Pope Francis.  But this isn&#x27;t as relevant to EVERYONE as you seem to assume.  Also, these are very bad metrics for the affect EITHER Snowden or Francis will have on history.<p>>So please don&#x27;t go yapping about how fucking important some half-dead fairytale is.\nThis is inappropriate and you were being a dick.  Yapping? Seriously?  I&#x27;m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you are just being silly here...<p>Edit: TL;DR; Even if you take away the belief system in the Catholic church and the Pope has an affect on a huge number of human beings, and that is really what this is all about...",1386798724
6891058,comment,6888623,6889539,1,0,shykes,,,"You&#x27;re right, today there are many systems which cannot run docker. There are several things we are doing to remediate that. Obviously there are no miracles, if you run a kernel which doesn&#x27;t support namespacing, you won&#x27;t get namespacing :) However:<p>* We can make the &quot;docker in a vm&quot; option much better. In another thread I mentioned boot2docker (<a href=\"http://github.com/steeve/boot2docker\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://github.com/steeve/boot2docker</a>) which is the smallest possible VM to run docker - currently 25MB. Of course there is a performance tradeoff but for, say, a developer&#x27;s mac or a server which is underutilized anyway, it may be exactly what you need.<p>* We are adding swappable execution drivers to docker, so that you can replace lxc (the current default) with openvz, or gracefully degrade to a simple chroot. Also a tradeoff - obviously you get very little guarantees of isolation, but for production servers which only run trusted payloads and don&#x27;t need to extra resource isolation within each server, it is a great option.<p>In both cases, you still get the benefit of a unique (as in byte-for-byte unique) payload which can be transferred across machines and executed with strong guarantees of repeatability and consistency. That is often a big improvement from shipping provisioning scripts which will dynamically pull dependencies each time, giving you &quot;good enough&quot; repeatability at best. Maybe you forgot to pin a dependency and the mirror was updated between 2 deploys? Maybe the python build on Fedora (staging machine) is not the same as on RHEL (production). Docker solves that. Yes, there are caveats and it&#x27;s not a silver bullet. And yes, god knows it is over-hyped. But the claims are not bullshit :)",1386798716

It&#x27;s a known problem since the dawn of computing: How do you control multiple users accessing a binary file cleanly over the network?<p>The solutions that are generally accepted as the right solutions are:<p>1. Version control systems. So in this case, SVN or Sharepoint (yes it is a version control system for documents).<p>2. Collaborative editing.<p>3. Synchronisation.<p>In favour of point 1 which I always suggest using, history is possible to tie to a user always, centrally controlled, archivable on your own site, actually really easy to manage and allows people to work entirely offline. It scales to mega-sized documents as well. Imagine our typical formal specs (sorry we&#x27;re too finicky about quality to do agile) which are 200-280 pages long in Google Docs?<p>Point 2 can lead to odd corruption.

I&#x27;m certainly not an expert in the matter, but perhaps my observations can relay some insight to others who just can&#x27;t seem to grasp it.<p>Snapchat is a tool that primarily allows a user to become closer to (1) acquaintances, and (2) existing friends who may have drifted away over time. Let&#x27;s rephrase this a few ways to unveil the value. Snapchat is a communication tool that&#x27;s useful for overcoming shyness. Snapchat allows users to break the ice, facilitate conversation, and overcome awkwardness. Snapchat allows the user to converse with acquaintances and distant friends that would otherwise be too awkward via other methods like texting, email, Facebook, etc.<p>In fewer words, Snapchat makes communication trivial.<p>Just Snap a picture of something, add some silly text or a drawing on top, and push it out to everyone. After all, what&#x27;s the harm? The picture goes away, and if no one Snaps back it doesn&#x27;t really matter. There&#x27;s no evidence of a failed attempted communication, e.g., an un-responded email, text without a reply, comment on a wall without a Like or a response. In this way, Snapchatting is a lot like fishing. Cast your snaps, see which old friends or acquaintances reply, and strike a conversation, hang out, hookup, etc. later on.<p>The disposable aspect of Snapchat provides a new medium for conversation starting. You know what conversation leads to? Deeper friendships. And who&#x27;s really interested in knowing who your friends are? If you aren&#x27;t making &quot;new friends&quot; on Facebook, but elsewhere, you can see why Facebook might be startled. But that fear starts to compound when you consider aging relationships are being nurtured on Snapchat as well.<p>After all, if you aren&#x27;t reconnecting with your current friends on Facebook, what good is it? All that&#x27;s left is the News Feed and what everyone is up to. Hm. Enter Snapchat&#x27;s &quot;My Story&quot; feature, where you can essentially create a 24-hour lasting Snap, very similar to status updates on Facebook. Interesting.<p>I&#x27;m not sure Facebook being cool or uncool has much to do with it. I suggest the bigger factor is being able to communicate with peers, despite shyness. Overcoming awkwardness, facilitating conversation with a lack of confidence, or whatever you want to call it... Snapchat is a layer below Facebook. Said another way, turning acquaintances into friends (Snapchat) pre-empts the need for maintaining friendships (Facebook).",1386797912

As far as I can tell, my resume is decent (modeled after careercup&#x27;s resume), I have stuff on my GitHub (no one really asked me for it though), but I still rarely get any replies (especially with resume black-holes like Jobvite - 0% reply rate). I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every approach from contacting people individually and &quot;showing passion&quot; for their company, to blasting my resume to anything I can find (ironically, response rates are about the same). I&#x27;m not particularly confident in my skills, but my get-an-interview rate is 100% for whenever I had to do a programming test/challenge for the initial application, so I can&#x27;t be all that bad, but it never works out in the end. I even had an interview at a (mid-sized) startup in Seattle that went from &quot;we&#x27;ll make you an offer&quot; to &quot;you&#x27;re not a good fit&quot; as soon as they found out I&#x27;m not a US citizen. The prevailing advice on HN for &quot;I can&#x27;t get a job&quot; seems to be &quot;get an internship&quot;, and that you just have to not drool during the interview to get one, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be as easy as some people make it out to be. I&#x27;m pretty desperate and at this point I&#x27;m looking for pretty much anything that would pay just enough for me to be able to survive the summer (I&#x27;m finishing up my junior year, so this is pretty much my last chance of getting a job that will allow me to stay in the US after graduation), but has depressed me to the point where it&#x27;s starting to affect my day-to-day life in pretty severe ways.

I&#x27;m finding it difficult to put into words what I&#x27;m thinking.<p>Pursuing pleasure as an end goal rarely leads to pleasure. A lot of addictions seem to stem from the pursuit of pleasure as an end. We <i>treat</i> people for doing something that makes them &quot;happy&quot; to the exception of all else (whether that be gambling, alcohol, drugs, etc.). I honestly think if there was a happiness pill we would consider treating people for taking it.<p>When I talk about doing something, I&#x27;m talking about what you do with what life throws at you. Everyone has different circumstances, but what is common is the ability to choose how we respond to those circumstances. Whether we make something (whatever that means to us) of what we are given or not.<p>Taking a happiness drug and checking out from the rest of life is deciding to do exactly nothing with what life has given us. And I honestly don&#x27;t think most people would want that.<p>I&#x27;ll end with a quote from Viktor Frankl&#x27;s excellent book Man&#x27;s Search For Meaning:<p>&quot;By declaring that man is responsible and must actualize the potential meaning of his life, I wish to stress that the true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man or his own psyche, as though it were a closed system. I have termed this constitutive characteristic &quot;the self-transcendence of human existence.&quot; It denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something or someone, other than oneself--be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself--by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love--the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself. What is called self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.&quot;<p>I am sure I have butchered my own thoughts, but hopefully this helps make some sense of what I&#x27;m trying to say.",1386797714

6890831,comment,6889027,6890616,6,0,dgacmu,,,"AFAICT, it&#x27;s a result of their internal architectural decisions vs. the structure of some of these crypto operations.  The simplest example is that AMD offers a hardware bit rotate instruction and NVidia doesn&#x27;t.  (The newer compute_35 devices have a funnel shifter that gets halfway there, but it requires using a 64 bit op, which is still slower).<p>But beyond that, for scrypt, AMD has an internal architecture that encourages using a internal 4-wide vector ops (the key being that threads in a stream can diverge and the scheduler handles them, but the vector ops are strictly locked).  This seems to give them an advantage in several &quot;stupidly parallel&quot; workloads that consist of basic operations in huge parallel, whereas Nvidia&#x27;s architecture regains ground when the control flow/etc., becomes a bit more complicated.  But calculating 64k SHA-2 or scrypt hashes in parallel doesn&#x27;t stress the thread scheduler or divergence handling at all.  Also, scrypt internally does well when you parallelize it into groups of 4 uint32&#x27;s - that&#x27;s actually the key optimization I added to my version of the miner.  Which, again, maps quite nicely to AMD&#x27;s preferred optimization path.",1386797064

Gmail is able to operate because users allow it to mine their personal messages to better tailor advertisements.<p>Google is built on top of and depends on the public- both to be its customers and to be the source of its products.

When the efficacy of your technologies is limited, then a technology that only gives you a small percentage edge over your opponent&#x27;s technology - say Iron vs Bronze - is survivable for the defender provided they have an edge in some other area, though not necessarily pleasant. However, as the efficacy of technology increases, you only need a small percentage edge over your opponent in terms of relative efficacy of technologies to have more than enough power to destroy all that you need to in order to remove them forever.<p>Consider that armies could be separated by hundreds of years of technology in the past, and still fight on a roughly equal footing. Technology did not more very fast, nor was it very powerful. Then imagine what an army of today would do to an army of a hundred, or even fifty years ago. In the Iran-Iraq war two armies with Cold-War level technology faced each other off for eight years. The Iraqi army were, however, swept aside very quickly by a more advanced force.<p>The timespan in which there&#x27;s a rough parity in power shortening. Even small difference in development with respect to time can rapidly become insurmountable when you&#x27;re dealing with a high rate of change and powerful technologies. What you&#x27;re defending is more or less static: people, land, resources, they&#x27;re not getting any more durable, while weapons are always becoming more powerful.<p>You only need one world ending plague. The defender has to be on top every time, the attacker only has to surpass them once. There is no chance to adapt to what they make, or to try again any more than biological evolution can adapt people to a bullet in the head - because any minor adaptation in that direction makes no difference when compared to the sorts of forces that are imparted.<p>And I don&#x27;t think we should have much confidence in the idea that the defender is going to be on top every time.<p>The questions seem to me to be ones of whether a reluctance to destroy the world is characteristic of organised systems, and whether organised systems will always have the edge over individual effort.

I&#x27;ve been stuck for over a week now trying to word this any other way possible because, in the current ordering of the sections, I&#x27;m covering determinants before linear transformations.\nPerhaps there is no better once sentence than talking about the volume and I should reorder the sections...<p>You&#x27;ve raised a very important point regarding &quot;routes to concepts&quot; which really should be asked more often!<p>> (ii) you can&#x27;t teach key insights just by saying a few words.<p>Generally true, though we have to say that the key difficulty in communicating insights is lacking prerequisites. Therefore, if you think very carefully about the prerequisite structure (i.e. model of the reader&#x27;s previous knowledge) you can do lot&#x27;s of interesting stuff in very few words.<p>> (i) the key insight varies from person to person more than you&#x27;d think,<p>Let G=(V,E) where V is the set of math concepts, and E are the links between them. Then there are as many ways to click on a concept x, as there there are in-links for x! In this case we have at least three routes:<p><pre><code>  Route 1: geometric\n   lin. trans T_A = {matrix:A, B_in:{e1,..,en}, B_out:{f1,..,fn}} \n   ---> what happens to a unit cube 1x1x1,\n        represented  (1,...1) w.r.t. B_in,\n        after going through T_A?\n        ---> output will be (1,..,1) w.r.t. B_out\n             ---> observe that cols of A are f1..fn\n                  therefore \n                     det(A) = (hyper)volume of (hyper)parallelepiped \n                              formed by vectors f1..fn\n   \n   Route 2: computational\n    det(A) = { formula for 2x2, formula for 3x3, ... }\n    ---> a easy test for invertibility of an n by n matrix\n    sidenote: see Cramer&#x27;s rule for another application of dets\n   \n   \n   Route 3: algebraic \n    given a 2x2 matrix A, \n    find a coefficients A T D that satisfy the following matrix equation:\n         B*A^2  + T*A  + D   = 0,\n    the linear term is the trace T = sum_i a_ii, the constant term is D = det(A).\n    sidenote:  B*λ^2 + T*λ + D = {characteristic poly. of A} = det(A-λI)\n\n</code></pre>\nSo perhaps the task of teaching math is not so much to try to find &quot;the right&quot; or &quot;the best&quot; route to a concept, but to collect many explanations of routes (edges in G), then come up with a coherent narrative that covers as many edges as possible (while respecting the partial-sorted-order of prerequisites ).",1386795875

The idea that the matter may be discrete rather than continuous is quite old; the word &quot;atom&quot; after all from ancient Greece. Wikipedia also mentions Indian philosophers had the idea. Of course, they never were able to prove that the idea was correct, and a modern educated viewer can not help but bring in the modern view of the atom when they see the word &quot;atom&quot; (protons, quarks, gluons, etc), but the modern view would not match either the Greek or Indian conception. The word choice of &quot;stated&quot; is correct enough; they did not prove, they did not demonstrate, they could not resolve the argument, but the very fundamental root idea was recognized.<p>Similarly, the modern ear hears &quot;relativity&quot; and can&#x27;t help but think of Einsteinian relativity, but the adjective &quot;Einsteinian&quot; is not redundant as it is not the only idea of relativity. Relativity as a concept also goes back a long way, but it looked more like Galilean relativity (if indeed it was even that formalized, which it probably wasn&#x27;t), which contains certain contradictions in it which can be determined with pure reasoning, and indeed may have been (see [1]).<p>The summary leads to misleading ideas about what the Indian philosophers really knew/discovered/thought, if for no other reason than there is no way to accurately summarize the ancient ideas in modern words that briefly; it is not clear to me whether the author of the linked web page is himself confused or being deliberately mendacious.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://mathpages.com/rr/s3-07/3-07.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mathpages.com/rr/s3-07/3-07.htm</a> , and indeed, the entire first half of that book or so.

Telling people to be rational isn&#x27;t going to make them that way.",1386795828

There is as much as 2,000 years of divergence between the earliest speculative date and absolutely attested known date for the <i>Vedas,</i> for example. A good outline of the issues in historiography of India can be found in <i>Mathematics in India</i> by Kim Plofker[1], who was trained both as a mathematician and Sanskrit scholar. Not always knowing when a particular text was composed has a lot of influence on knowing or not knowing which ideas appeared in what era in the development of science and mathematics in India.<p>(One difference between India and either China or the near east is that the writing materials used in India, often plaited sheets of palm leaves, were much less durable than the silk sheets or bamboo slats used in China, or the fired clay tablets or papyrus sheets or parchment hides used in the near east. So many of the earliest writings from India have perished, while remarkably old writings still exist from either China or Sumer.)<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-India-Kim-Plofker/dp/0691120676\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-India-Kim-Plofker/dp/06911...</a>",1386795621

6890663,comment,6888852,6889287,4,0,kyrra,,,"I went from a fully MS Office company, to a different company that used Google Apps, which was recently bought by another company that uses MS Office (that we are now moving to).  I&#x27;ve had extensive experience with both products at this point.<p>===Outlook vs Gmail===<p>Outlook has a lot of things going for it.  One of my main complaints is the functionality difference between the PC and OSX versions of Outlook.  Outlook on the Mac just isn&#x27;t as polished and is missing a number of features that the PC version has.  On the plus side of Outlook, it has much more powerful searching/sorting abilities.  You can sort messages by a large number of fields.  Searching allows you to filter on different fields as well.  The big part of searching is that Outlook will do substring searching (gmail will only match on whole words).<p>Gmail excels at labels and visual presentation.  As it is geared towards the basics that a user will need, a lot of data that you just may not care about is hidden away.  This makes the bulk of what is important more visible.  Also, I feel it presents long email threads in an easier-to-follow manner.  Plus, once you learn keybinds in Gmail, it works the same on PC and Mac (which is totally different for Outlook).  The other big plus for Gmail is proper handling of HTML.  Outlooks HTML engine is pretty atrocious.<p>Calendars: both are pretty comparable to one another.  Outlook is nice as you get desktop alerts even with Outlook closed (google can do this with the 3rd party apps).  But Google is nice in that you can set multiple people as being able to edit/update an event, so management of events can be easier.<p>=== Word vs Docs ===<p>I&#x27;d say the only way Google wins in this is collaboration.  Being able to work on the same document with multiple people at the same time is such an amazing feature, I&#x27;m sad to lose it.  But at the same time, there is so much that Google Docs just can&#x27;t do.  So much advanced formatting, numbering bullets, and layout that it just isn&#x27;t all that great at.  If you just need simple documents, Google Docs can handle it, just don&#x27;t expect anything too fancy.<p>=== Excel vs Sheets ===<p>Sort of the same argument as Word vs Docs.  Collaboration is amazing in Sheets, but it misses a lot of advanced functionality and formatting.  It&#x27;s ok for basic stuff, but don&#x27;t try to do anything to advanced.<p>Funny enough, in this category I feel Apple&#x27;s Numbers is a really great tool.  The D&D game I&#x27;m part of uses a Numbers sheet to handle characters, and one of the big features I like is embedding multiple tables into a single view (something Excel or Sheets can&#x27;t do).<p>=== Powerpoint vs Presentation ===<p>Powerpoint again is similar to the Word vs Docs argument.  Collaboration is the one main feature Google wins at.  Google Presentation has 2 major issues for me: 1) it doesn&#x27;t auto-resize text if you go beyond the size of the box (it just overflows).  2) layout of slides can slightly differ between edit view and presentation view, which can be very annoying.",1386795615
6890662,comment,6890464,6890464,1,0,dmlorenzetti,,,"Search could learn to handle a hierarchy of mailboxes.  For example, if you have labels &quot;project1&quot; and &quot;project2&quot;, each with sub-labels under them, it doesn&#x27;t seem possible to make a search in &quot;project1&quot; to go into the sub-labels.<p>Grep-based search would be good.<p>When replying to a message, it would be nice if the controls for breaking the window loose of the rest of the application didn&#x27;t require four or five actions, in different parts of the screen.  Here&#x27;s what I mean.  Hit &quot;reply&quot; to a message.  If you want to pop that window loose, so that it&#x27;s actually useable while you run through other messages, you first go to the upper left corner of the editing area, click the drop-down, and hit &quot;Pop out reply&quot;.  Then go to the upper right of the subwindow that just opened, hold down shift, and click the arrow that points up and to the left.  None of it is intuitive, and it&#x27;s just too much clicking for such a simple action.<p>It would be nice if the editor wasn&#x27;t so forgetful about the insertion point.  For example, if you&#x27;re editing some text in a reply, and click on the &quot;...&quot; icon to see the message you&#x27;re responding to, the insertion point hops to the top of the editing window.<p>Ability to remove an attachment.<p>When you delete a message, and you&#x27;re looking in Trash, have the quick-preview line (i.e., the first few words, shown in the main screen listing all the messages) show the contents of the message you&#x27;re actually looking at, rather than the first sentence in the most recent e-mail with the same subject.  I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve panicked, thinking that I deleted an important e-mail, rather than some formulaic &quot;Catch you tomorrow&quot; or &quot;No problem&quot; message that I had trashed.<p>I&#x27;ve long ago given up hoping that some organizational capability would come to Gmail that went beyond the pathetic &quot;conversations&quot; mode.  Gmail&#x27;s idea of organization pretty much amounts to this: (1) you either want to list all e-mails by subject all the time, or you want to list them by time all the time; (2) you only rarely want to switch back and forth between those two views; and (3) if you want to list them in any other way, then it&#x27;s a &quot;search&quot; which delivers limited results, and disappears the instant you navigate away from it.",1386795614

Google did not &quot;mug&quot; anyone - it is the reason for your traffic to begin with. The fact that you even ever had discoverability  among a billion or so websites is a beautiful thing. Additionally, have some perspective, the search is a free tool that is very tough to get right. This might sound harsh, but I believe the effort in complaining could be better allocated into promoting the authors&#x27; sister&#x27;s business. To emphasize, Google search is a FREE tool - use it to get business but don&#x27;t make it your bread and butter because it is optimized for users, advertisers - not the content creators.

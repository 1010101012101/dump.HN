I could straighten my hair every time I get out of the shower, dye and pluck my eyebrows every other week, keep my roots dyed monthly, devote 20 minutes to make-up daily, keep my nails in shape, take better care of my skin, tan, shave often, and tone my abs. Frankly, I don't have the time or motivation. Why bother when I could read, code, or do a million other interesting things?<p>There are a few women who don't have to do as much to be beautiful - I was always envious of people with dark complexions and straight hair for this reason. But for most people, it does take time. It's not something that just is. Nearly anyone can look wonderful with the right lighting, clothing and make-up, and vice-versa.<p>Also, I've never met anyone who admitted to being attracted to morons, yet many are.

Scale to 100000? Add many servers, and load balancers, maybe master-slave replication for database. Scale to 10 million? Putting more boxes in your data center help you anymore because your data center is full, you don't have enough bandwidth and even the master-slave database setup you had overloaded. You need to setup multiple geographically distinct data centers in the world and shard your database. What if you have 100 billion users? Adding more data centers on the same planet won't help anymore; I don't even know whether anybody is technically capable of serving 100 billion concurrent users.<p>Sure, the latter architecture can serve 1 concurrent user, but it's also 100000 times more expensive.

563126,comment,562827,563065,0,0,metaguri,,,"I was under the impression that Netflix looked at your ratings, found people ""similar"" to you, and made recommendations based on that. Since signing up for Netflix, I""ve found that at least on the UI side, it's as you describe: driven by actor, genre, etc.<p>The beauty about the raw data approach is that it finds people with similar preferences to you. This is, I think, the real manifestation of O'Reilly's ""Web 2.0."" Rather than a semantic web, with ontologies and categorization the data do, indeed, speak for themselves.<p>Even if we were able to extract categorizations based on the preferences in the underlying Netflix data, it'd be difficult to map them to actual categories that we're familiar with. I'd envision it more like a PCA decomposition, where the principle components will be the strongest characteristics among each clique of like-minded movie watchers.<p>But alas, my Netflix home page is filled with crappy movies (the Matrix has a near-5 rating, but most other movies with its actors are complete crap). Instead I rely on friends with similar preferences for recommendations... which is what Netflix was supposed to offer. If that functionality is hidden somewhere, then they need to do a better job of exposing it.",1239781361

But this is not a start up revolution, it is a technological revolution, the revolution is not the start up culture but the advances made in communication technology. As such it is not any different than the industrial revolution as far as the importing of technological aspects is concerned. Nor is it any different from a power plant, every nation must have internet and with Italian internet comes Italian Google, which as it happens I think it is libero.it although that might be more like yahoo than google.

I was still in college and was a co-op student at ""big blue"".  Great job, I worked 7 days a week and actually slept under my desk at times.  This one night I was driving home around 2am.  I think it was a Thursday, could have been Friday.  A cop in Decatur (That's home to Emory) pulls me over in front of the courthouse for a having a broken headlight. Fair enough, I was a poor college student, but I'll take the ticket.  Not good enough for him, he was trolling for drunk drivers.  He spent a lot of time asking me questions and after shining a flashlight throughout my car asked me if he could search my trunk.  I told him ""no sir, I don't think that has anything to do with a broken headlight"".  The next words from him were ""get out of the car, boy"".  It went downhill from there.  It was a very abusive next 30 minutes...he was careful to tell me it was only him and me out there, no witnesses, until he finally searched my trunk anyway (which he could do now that I was arrested)...in the end, the judge sent me home knowing full well what happened and didn't so much as admonish the police.<p>Since this happened to me, I've been careful to notice the stories of others.  There are some great police officers throughout America; they deserve our respect.  Unfortunately, the ""brotherhood"" protects the bad ones as well.",1239780502

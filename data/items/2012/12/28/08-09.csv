The parts of the project that touch twisted is always the most complex to explain to anyone else. However, async code is always hard. It also doesn't help that the code base shows it's age.. non-PEP8, strange naming conventions etc.<p>However, one thing that I've noticed with recent projects using Tornado (<a href=""https://github.com/rhettg/Dynochemy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rhettg/Dynochemy</a>) is that some concepts that I thought was overly complex in Twisted makes sense eventually. For example, handling errors in async code is really hard. The framework twisted came up with with Deferred, callbacks and errbacks is pretty smart. You almost have to re-invent twisted before you can appreciate it.<p>I'd recommend reading the original paper for more information: <a href=""http://www6.uniovi.es/python/pycon/papers/deferex/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www6.uniovi.es/python/pycon/papers/deferex/</a>",1356684034

I still think that the degree in Physics was the best thing I could have done at the time, and I learned a ridiculous amount from it.<p>During grad school I learned that academia involved far more grant-writing and politics than I enjoyed, and that I really did enjoy working with computers more than doing bench science.

I love what I do and I love that I'm still supporting scientists and engineers, though I do miss the lab bench occasionally. I still read a lot about physics, but my work and most of my side projects are focused on HPC.<p>More importantly, I have a wonderful wife who plays roller derby and two cats that demand an inordinate amount of attention; I fence epee, and have since college; I play a lot of board games, read a lot of science fiction, and still pick up my trumpet every once in a while.

Also, Credit Card implies independence and privacy. If you need a loan in India, almost always, parents will come through.

This means that textbooks need to meet stricter standards. Which mean that there needs to be some kind of review. Which means that someone needs to pay for that review.

By your phrasing (""force..other people who purchase insurance..to subsidize their care with or without an employer"") it seems you are opposed to that idea (sorry if I presume incorrectly). If so is the idea seriously that if you get diagnosed with a serious medical condition then no one should subsidize care and you should basically be driven into bankruptcy or death due to lack of medical treatment? Perhaps this is an issue I am too close to since I am currently seeing an endocrinologist and just had a brain MRI, but prior to that (and likely still) I would say the insurance companies cleaned up on me / I subsidized a lot of other people since I have rarely had any medical conditions / costs for the entire time I have had medical insurance. But that doesn't bother me, so I guess the idea that insurance being a pool to subsidize / provide a safety net in an organized society regardless of employment somehow being portrayed as a bad thing is something I am having trouble wrapping my mind around.",1350617827

Here is the legal situation as far as I understand it (IANAL, standard disclaimers apply).<p>The Wikimedia Foundation hosts content on its servers provided by the community. Usually, the individual contributors own the copyright to all the content. And when they submit content to a WMF site, like Wikipedia, they  explicitly agree to license the work under terms such that others can use it. (I am ignoring the case of fair use for now).<p>Certain kinds of contributions, however, are not original to the contributor. This gets confusing because then you have to prove that it's okay to reuse.<p>Depictions of national flags are often ineligible for copyright, or are explicitly granted to the public domain, in their country of origin. However, ""public domain"" has no legal meaning internationally.<p>The CC0 license is really designed for creators who want to dedicate their work to be freely copied, like public domain, but want something that is legally meaningful.<p>But - there was a large collection of flags licensed CC0 which became the basis of the Wikimedia Commons collection. Other flags have specific justifications for why they are public domain, sometimes quoting laws from specific countries. This is the good thing about Wikimedia Commons, it doesn't force you into any straightjacket to explain how the license works. But that also means that everything's kind of a mess if you want to get a straight answer to a question like ""under what license could I republish all the flags on Wikimedia Commons?""<p>And that's where it sits. If you squint, everything's not so bad. But maybe Wikimedia Commons should relicense <i>all</i> the flags as ineligible for copyright -- it would make things a lot simpler.<p>Of course, because copyright is taking over the world, I would not be surprised if there are some nations that would insist they <i>do</i> hold the copyright to their flags. For instance, the EC insists it holds the copyright to their flag and the Euro symbol.

Relying on ppl to be semicolon hunters is poor for readability.<p>It also means you can't put more expressions on the same line because doing so requires a semi-colon which then eliminates the special semicolon behavior.

To an extent, the inherent risks that come with starting a new business is a good thing -- it forces would-be-entrepreneurs to assess critically what they would gain or lose before taking the plunge. The inextricable dependency on company health insurance, however, should not have to play a role in that risk assessment.<p>Maybe I'm just being picky over semantics, but instead of creating a ""wide safety net for failure,"" which to me sounds like something that encourages poor business judgment, I would be in favor of reducing the extrinsic risks of starting a new business (e.g. insurance) so entrepreneurs could focus on the risks relevant to the business itself. But like I said, I might be nitpicking over choice of words, so forgive me.<p>Knowing there's a risk of failure isn't so bad -- it makes me try really hard at, well, not failing.",1350616459

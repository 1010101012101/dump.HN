It's true that the US hasn't ever attacked or declared war on a nuclear state (well, i'm not sure what the engagement between N and S Korea last year should be called), so we're in hypothetical territory on that subject.

So, theoretically (heh), even the worst licensed MD/architect/etc has met the minimum requirements for practicing. I'm not saying they can build an 80-story skyscraper, but in software we have no such means by which to measure potential practitioners.<p>And getting a pilot's license is a little bit different from being licensed to practice medicine. It also depends on whether you're referring to a private or commercial pilot. Private pilots only need 40 hours[1] of time in the air. And even once a commercial pilot is licensed, there are other regulations in place. And a driver's license is an even lower bar, of course.<p>So no, licensing (in any form) does not ensure that the licensee is ""good"" or ""brilliant,""\n but it does allow us to ensure a minimum bar that does not currently exist in the software industry today.<p>(And no worries, it's a pet peeve of mine as well.

This is definitely great in a company where mainline may move fairly fast and rebasing by developers is a way to have the history look linear, without merging ""master"" into a feature branch.<p>- Git has support for short-lived play branches, Mercurial has this as well with hg strip, but it is an extension and not part of the core, or you have to clone a full repository, makes working with others harder too as I can't just push the play branch up to my clone on the server (assuming a Github model).<p>I've found that once I realised how Git works under the hood that it made so much more sense, not only that I feel that it is more powerful, for example here is a gist of something I recently did for a repo at work:<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/878192"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/878192</a><p>This helps with other internals projects in that we are not pulling in the full ""master"" branch, instead we are just pulling in a very specific sub-set of files, which is easy to keep updated with git pull -s subtree.<p>I'm sure that I have only touched the least significant parts of what Git has to offer, and that there is so much more waiting for me, but that is my reasoning and why I like it so much.",1300772594

The current basis of it being an inbox for files is already on the right track, and something I haven't seen attempted before, but it needs a little more verisimilitude to email:<p>1) The requirement to invite / induce signup / confirm ""connections"" needs to be ruthlessly optimized out â€” I should be able to just send a file to any email easily, forming a 'weak' connection. Maybe they have to do a 3 second signup to download the file, but it needs to be all in one motion. This obviously brings up a ton of issues like how to display the now 4 types of connections and unsolicited files, but it's essential to you getting traction.<p>2) 'sent' files need to behave like a outbox â€” remember that one of the biggest uses of email attachments is just sending stuff to yourself. Really you should just implement that straight up, it's the biggest use I'd have, and one I think you would find yourself as soon as you get the iOS client going. The dropbox iOS app's UI is terrible for it (pick one photo at a time and wait), plus really the filesystem metaphor is all wrong anyway!

The reason for this is that a certain amount of ""demonstrated irrationality"" is required to make the prospect of mutual assured destruction convincing to all players. Which means that if the world were truly rational we would expect some use of nuclear devices.

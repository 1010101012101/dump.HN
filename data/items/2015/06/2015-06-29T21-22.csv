No just because the program never writes to spi.S does not mean you can delete the while loop.

I don&#x27;t define &quot;difficult&quot; as &quot;showing absolutely no regard for your own and other&#x27;s safety by maintaining a speed not suitable for the area&quot;.<p>What that translates to is I go faster on the open canyon road and I go slower in areas with more pedestrians. It isn&#x27;t more physically or mentally taxing, but simply requires me to maintain a safer speed. Similar to how the speed limit on a freeway is 100-120km/h but on a residential street is 40km/h.<p>To me, your argument sums up to &quot;I want to go 120km in the residential&quot;. Which indeed would make safety more difficult.<p>You should treat your bike like a car. Sure it doesn&#x27;t weigh 1,500 kilos and won&#x27;t necessarily kill someone if you strike them; you&#x27;re still a potential hazard for walking pedestrians and should respect that by maintaining a <i>safe</i> speed. Not the one you desire to go simply because you <i>aren&#x27;t</i> in a car.

1) that a fast reactor can be waste-negative, I.e. transform existing waste to energy.
2) a fast reactor destroys the long lived waste- instead of trying to store waste for a hundred thousand years it&#x27;s on the order of a hundred.<p>Both of these are critically important for existing waste but also having an emission free energy source with a closed fuel cycle.  No other energy source is better than a hundred thousandth as energy dense and no other energy source could produce clean energy for its own recycling.<p>It&#x27;s obviously just a cool technology but more than that it&#x27;s amazing what that could mean for the environment and remote communities.

Fossil energies are just a very large chemical sink for the energy of the sun, and we just burnt it away at once in geological scales. If humanity now starts to deploy nuclear fission or fusion, it will heat the earth even more. Because that energy was basically trapped inside the atomic core, where it didn&#x27;t play a significant role for the global climate.

Stripping that reduces the size at the obvious cost of debugging ease.<p>- When an OCaml module is touched for a single function, the entire module is included at present.  OCaml 4.02.0 included module aliases to make it easier to break down module hierarchies into less monolithic chunks.

Porting this to native code is on the TODO list, but needs some fiddling with frame pointers in the generated binaries to do a good job.<p>So the overall answer is that reducing the deployed binary size is now a compiler problem, since the unikernel architecture lets us provide it with much more information (configuration files and  OS libraries as well as the application logic).",1435613385

You have to put trust into closed source software at some point - do you drive a car?<p>> You &quot;hope&quot; Chrome is &quot;based on&quot; Chromium---what relevance does this hope have for a factual discussion?<p>Like I said before - relating to security I hope certain systems like OpenSSL and CAs are not compromised. I&#x27;m a realistic person and I assume they aren&#x27;t. Do you check and pin every SSL certificate you come across? How do you know that you don&#x27;t have a bad CA certificate in your store right now?<p>I&#x27;m not saying I have irrevocable proof that Chrome&#x27;s code is a fork of Chromium - but there are enough indications that suggest this[1]. I&#x27;m not saying you should or shouldn&#x27;t use Chrome - go use lynx if that makes you feel better.<p>> And what about Microsoft and Apple?<p>What about them? I&#x27;m not saying they are perfect - but I&#x27;m also not totally paranoid that I&#x27;m going to refuse them on the basis that I can&#x27;t see their code.<p>> And the many well-reasoned criticisms of browser-based encryption?<p>That&#x27;s a loaded question if I ever saw one. Web applications like cryptocat are bad because they send the keys with Javascript.

The Sellafield site has been and is still home to a very large spent fuel reprocessing plant that handles spent fuel from numerous UK reactors.  Reprocessing plants are an entirely different beast.  And a lot of the activity at the Sellafield site is generally from older, messier technologies as well.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sellafield"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sellafield</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnox</a>",1435611913

All hail orcas!<p>But all kidding aside, i do have appreciation for arguments against anthropocentrism, or at least suppositions of human superiority. Sure, there&#x27;s a spectrum regarding to how “intelligent” (read: advanced faculties of empathy, planning, language, <i>etc.</i>) different species seem to be in general, but i definitely believe we as humans are very much on the bad side of the spectrum regarding how we treat non-humans.  We have a long way to go yet.  Locking up animals in zoos, through to slaughtering them for food after a life of misery, all don&#x27;t seem to me behaviours befitting a species which calls itself empathic and intelligent. As somebody wise once said, a society should be judged on how it deals with its weakest members.<p>But yeah, i guess the article is preaching to the choir in my case, since i would be in favour of more protection of non-human rights, not only for orcas (presumably rather high on the intelligence scale) but also for most non-humans we use for food, medical trials, <i>etc.</i> Whether that means they should be granted personhood, however, seems a tricky question, which i assume is best fought out by lawyers. The thing is, as mentioned elsewhere in this thread, that probably entails many responsibilities and prohibitions (<i>e.g.</i>, no killing each other) which would simply be impractical/absurd (having said that, i like the idea lower down in the thread, that inter-species violence could be considered in a similar fashion to crimes outside of a given jurisdiction). Still, if not personhood, i would at the very least be in favour of universal rights for all sentient beings (ha, i hear you now, what is the cut-off for sentience? Mice? Flies? Earthworms? Bacteria? This is a hypothetical and hand-wavy argument)—they should not be kept in zoos against their will, and (more pertinently) not be killed for our sustenance/experiments/gratification. Basically, they should not be property.<p>...but none of that seems to be very broadly underwritten by society at large. One can dream, i guess.",1435611837

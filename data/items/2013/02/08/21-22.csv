I never said anything about wiping data or canceling a contract...</i><p>You said:<p><i>You don't officially transfer anything when you sell a phone or a Kindle...</i><p>But that's not really true. That's my point. You would follow some procedures, involving the phone company officials (not government officials) to avoid paying the buyer's phone bills or Kindle bills. In this way, the phone and the Kindle are like a car. The transfer of ownership requires official help because the Kindle, the phone, and the car are in a sense just nodes on a network. Other goods, from pencils to diamond rings, are fundamentally different, and don't require the involvement of officialdom when they change hands.<p>You believe that you can cleave the car example off as a special category of property, different because it's encumbered by government papers. My point is that a lot of electronic gadgetry is already encumbered in the same way. The papers don't have to be government ones.<p>I don't see the problem as one of proof of ownership. Information that could have helped an investigation supposedly existed, was offered, then the offer was rescinded, then the information was ""lost."" If a police department had behaved this way, the readers of HN would call it corruption.",1360360677

I recently took a vacation on a leg of the California Zephyr Amtrak route (which goes from Chicago to San Francisco).  During a wait one of the stations, I picked up copies of the industry rags.  Though I never would have guessed, it seems that there are strong political and financial forces that are very much <i>against</i> a prolific public transit system in the US, with California being quite a battleground of the pro and anti crowds.<p>Whether or not the tech giants in Silicon Valley are in fact trying to improve the public transit situation, they have a steep hill to climb in order to make any progress.<p>Though I am constantly surprised by public transit initiatives in smaller inland cities.  Salt Lake City has made substantial public transit improvements in the past decade.  Tuscon, already having a decent bus system, has a modest 3.9-mile light rail project slated to be completed late this year.<p>So I have some hope for public transit in the US as a whole.",1360360596

And yes - it's a punishment, as the expected outcome of a jury trial tends to be much harsher than a plea bargain. I really doubt under 10% of defendants would demand a trial if there weren't effectively a penalty for doing so. (Aaron never would have gotten 10 years, but even 12 months would still be much harsher than the 6 months they offered).<p>The only reason to plead guilty should be to save time, costs, and establish contrition (sorry judge, I did it, and I feel bad ... can you give me a slightly lower penalty?)<p>I understand that public prosecutors and judges are underpaid and overworked, but if they can't do their jobs there's no shortage of law grads out there. It would cost a little more, but if you're locking someone up for 6 months and can't afford give them a day in court (Aaron's case may have been a bit more than a day, but I doubt the average court case would take much time at all) then you shouldn't be prosecuting them at all.<p>I guess there's not as much scope for corruption though.

The letter C does not tend to be used by itself as often or as widely as the word ""go,"" so even if C hadn't already had an unfair advantage, it would have less of a problem just on this basis. The odds that an arbitrary programming article unrelated to C will have ""C"" scattered about are not all that great. The odds that an arbitrary programming article unrelated to Go will use the word ""go"" are actually pretty decent. Put another way, ""Go"" is a more common word than ""C,"" so it generates more noise.<p>I don't find this issue to be all that problematic anymore since the search engines seem to have learned that ""go"" in conjunction with programming terms indicates an interest in Go-centric material, but I did find it vexing when Go was younger and I was first trying to learn it.",1360359778

It's pretty common to find text that is ridiculously thin, mostly on designer's websites. I'm no devotee of Windows or Mac (though I don't own a Mac yet), but it seems pretty clear that the design crowd needs to start at least spinning up a simple Windows (or even Linux - Ubuntu's text rendering is in between OS X's and Windows') VM and make sure that their text is readable on the platforms that nearly everyone uses. Even Android and (I believe, though I wouldn't be surprised if I was wrong) iOS don't render text as thickly as OS X. Failing to optimize for different text renderings and making your text extremely thin alienates both the mobile market and 95% of the PC market.<p>Also, Chrome has terrible, evil, nasty text rendering in general, at least on Windows.

The fact that one still has RubyMotion, eero, MonoTouch, and a host of others, despite their original stance of no is a nice circumstance.

Become an expert at applying the basic methods of proof""</i><p>This may be good advice if you want to get into pure mathematics, but huge parts of maths are not pure.<p>Applied mathematics is very relevant for programmers - especially game programmers. It's not a sin to sacrifice mathematical rigour for the sake of discovery.<p>It doesn't even have to be a direct map (e.g. actual implementations of calculus or such). Just understanding various bits and pieces in granular detail can help you get precise and testable quantitative ideas for problems.<p>For instance, a while ago I wanted to implement a kind of smooth up-and-down motion for an object in my game. Almost immediately I thought of equations of this form:<p>(y position) = (some amplitude)* sin((some frequency)*(time)) + (some value to denote the origin)<p>This is a first step for some fairly interesting up-and-down motion - the rest is all a matter of finding suitable constants.<p>Similar things come to mind when you want to move an object smoothly to another position along a line, with a decreasing speed:<p>position = ((position you want to move to) - (current position)) / (some constant) + (some minimum speed)<p>This stuff just flashes before your mind if you've done plenty of physics (or 'mechanics' in mathematics) before. What's more, you'll know countless other ways of increasing the complexity of your equations without having to do much trial & error hacking (except to find things like constants and such).<p>For games, I'm convinced that there's still an incredibly huge variety of mathematical behaviour that has yet to be harnessed for the implementation of actual game mechanics. (Games usually just use some game engine's implementation of only some parts of classical mechanics, for instance.)<p>Never underestimate the relevance of applied mathematics to real-world programming, even though it doesn't really occupy a spectacularly prominent position in CS-focused courses.",1360359254

(I'm a non citizen on a temp work visa, so I'm all for getting easier immigration paths, but still I think the risk to the local job market is not just giving more visas, the risk is better offshore / remote options in the not so far future, like faster bandwidth allowing 3D video conferences, remote presence robots, and simply growing improvement in offshore talent offering, this might sound funny now, but I'm sure a few years from now, YC will even fund a few companies that do it)",1360358645

Markets have always been able to crash quickly, but without computers you're not going to get phrases like ""paused for five seconds"" to mean anything.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash</a>",1360357886

There is no such thing as inherent value unless you are describing a use and not the price someone would be willing to pay for something. For example, wood can be used to fuel a fire but that doesn't tell us anything about its' inherent value in exchange. That it has inherent value on these terms is obvious enough. For me it has almost none because I don't have a stove to safely burn it. Others feel differently.",1360357871

Having tried a few games in this category, I generally realized about ten minutes after installation I didn't download a game, I downloaded a money funnel.</i><p>Widespread scammy/spammy feeling greedy money-suckage? Sounds like great news to me! That shouts opportunity.<p>I think Valve has a formula that could do well in a market like that described above. You keep the size of the company small, so expenses are low, thus minimizing the temptation to money-suck. On top of that, you emphasize user-generated content. This increases the game's value, harnessing resources to compete with content ground-out by larger shops' payrolls, while offloading development risk for content to the users. The game makes money as a marketplace.<p>Most importantly, build your brand on an emphasis on quality and playability. Steer clear of the mentality that you give people something for free so you can addict them using variable schedule of reward to suck money out of them. Be genuinely focused on delivering fun and build the brand on that.<p>It's those companies who will eventually stand out over self-deluded hacks who can't see up over their own swollen greed.

In the USA, parcels were squarish, requiring roads everywhere, requiring everyone to have automobiles. Whereas Canada made theirs long and narrow, to optimize farm-to-market transportation. Subtly different initial conditions causing very different land use.<p>In the jurisdiction I live, better transit has been actively thwarted for decades by the suburbans. For example, years ago, we got an Oregon-style Growth Management Act, which tries to slow sprawl, preserving farm lands and habitat. The suburbans frame it as anti-growth. But in fact GMO is pro urban and opposition is anti-urban.<p>I am fascinated by the increasing urbanization of the under 30 demographic: It's happening <i>despite</i> the pro-sprawl incentives and policies. An example of society way out in front of policy.<p>Locally, I think this is perfectly captured by the head quarters of Microsoft and Amazon. In the 90s, Microsoft created a campus atmosphere in former second growth woods (Bellevue/Redmond). Having nearly everything newly minted university graduates would need right there on campus. It was very desirable.<p>Now in the 2010s, Amazon is transforming an urban area, South Lake Union. The area now has housing, hip food, great access to parks, culture, etc. In fact, in order to attract the young talent they need, I can't imagine Amazon locating anywhere other than an urban environment.",1360357245

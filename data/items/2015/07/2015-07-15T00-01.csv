While prices gradually started creeping up, DLC/IAP/microtransactions were really all that was left to them to find new ways of maximizing revenue and shareholder value.<p>When you are legally mandated to do what is right for shareholders, is it really <i>your</i> fault that you have to optimize for what makes the most money vs. what is right for your customers, especially when the two are not always perfectly aligned?<p>As an avid gamer I remember way back in the day when we first started getting a whiff of microtransactions becoming a &quot;thing.&quot;  I knew it was going to be the new reality and fought it tooth and nail.  To date I&#x27;ve only made a small handful of microtransactions to support games I truly love that have tried to do the right thing for their users.<p>That said, they really have brought out the worst in gaming companies and while gaming has finally &quot;hit the masses&quot; with mobile gaming, there has definitely been a drop in the average game&#x27;s quality in the gold rush.<p>The reality is though that whales drive gaming, and microtransactions facilitate whales spending massively more on games than the &quot;buy it once&quot; model. So game developers optimize towards that, and unfortunately that tends to skew towards addictive treadmill models that have to make the game <i>less fun</i> to maximize revenue.  At least with old school expansions and such, they had to actually make the game awesome and enjoyable to get people to buy more content for it.",1436921692

People <i>have</i> asked why that decision was made. The only answer I&#x27;ve seen is that Pocket popular as an add-on, which just raises more questions.<p>> If you&#x27;re not using Pocket and it is not sending any data because you&#x27;re not using it, having that feature present is actually harming you?<p>I work with intelligent, technically knowledgeable people who didn&#x27;t realize Pocket was a third-party service. Or they assumed that Mozilla wouldn&#x27;t ship a feature like that without client-side encryption. My parents don&#x27;t understand &quot;client-side encryption&quot;, but they understand &quot;even Mozilla can&#x27;t see your bookmarks&quot;, which is what made them comfortable with Firefox Sync. They don&#x27;t understand why the new kind of bookmark is different.<p>I no longer trust Mozilla to clearly communicate when, how, or why privacy has taken a back seat to developers&#x27; convenience or other goals, so I have to spend time scrutinizing every new feature.

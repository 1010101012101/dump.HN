Some argue its a waste and an environmental disaster that people change phones every couple of years, but it drives a technological development which trickles down to less lucrative, glamorous and mass market applications.

What kinds of positions have you been looking for?<p>If you&#x27;re just sending your resume online you need to do a lot more. Don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out to recruiters or individuals at companies directly (but be professional about it). You have to treat finding a job as a job in of itself. Track leads, use multiple forms of communication (online, email, social, snail mail, in person even), and follow up on positions you apply to if you don&#x27;t hear back in a reasonable amount of time.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve found the best leads are through people I already know or people I meet. I would look if there are any meetups or networking events nearby you can attend. If that doesn&#x27;t work, perhaps you can virtually create a presence online by contributing to open projects or be more active on visible forums (HN, Stack Overflow, etc.).<p>Also, maybe you can broaden your scope to a wider array of positions so you can just get started working somewhere. Sometimes once you start at a company other positions open up that you can transition too.<p>That aside, a few notes on your site:<p>* The Voter link doesn&#x27;t work.<p>* The Mlinar link opens a page with the same CS:GO language.<p>* Your grammar is a bit stilted. I&#x27;m guessing English isn&#x27;t your native language, but if English speakers are your your target audience you may want to clean it up.<p>* The individual portfolio pages need richer descriptions of the kind of work you were doing.<p>* You have a few mailto links, but you don&#x27;t actually list your email anywhere.",1416696719

8646945,comment,8643248,8646485,0,0,jpgvm,,,"I was a big Xen guy back in the day.<p>The big takeaway from Hamilton&#x27;s talk was actually something that dawned on me when they released the c3/m3/i2 instances which is what they have done with SR-IOV.<p>The software stack that implements the AWS VPC fast path must be running on the NIC itself. This is a big deal.
Being able to implement the require isolation/tunneling/encapsulation logic and routing in the NIC is a huge performance boost and drastically simplifies the hypervisor. Well, the software portion of the hypervisor atleast.<p>If you listened closely to the talk he laid out the differences in latency impact of each layer in the networking stack, from the fibre (nanoseconds) up to the software stack at some number of milliseconds, several orders of magnitude worse than anything else in the stack.<p>The reason why the quoted latency is so large is how para-virtualized networking is implemented. In order for it to be (bandwith) performant it needs to use large ring buffers with many segments. This is very throughput optimised and latency suffers a ton as a result.<p>By moving all of the queuing to the NIC you get a bunch of benefits, namely the dom0 (basically the host in Xen terminology) is no longer involved in pushing packets and you are not incuring the cost of the Linux networking stack 2x. In the paravirt model the skbs are transferred across the circular buffer into the host OS where they are injected into a virtual interface, thus traversing the full net stack again.<p>In the SR-IOV model the address space of the virtual NIC is mapped into the guest OS using Intel&#x27;s IO-MMU extensions and the guest is then able to communicate directly with the NIC, thus 100% bare metal performance.<p>If SR-IOV was the only improvement it would be impressive, however it&#x27;s the consequence of it&#x27;s existence which makes the biggest difference. If the guest is talking directly to the NIC, then all of the encap/decap is HW accelerated too and in theory this means the full networking stack is end-to-end in HW.",1416696458

And you can get a heavier weight either by using more expensive material (why use a cheap one? it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s going to wear or anything), or a larger hole.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what determines the cost of digging a whole, but I suspect depth matters more than area.<p>Also, does the shaft has to be vertical?  You could dig it with a sharp slope, and put your weight on rails.  That would make the shaft longer for the same depth, but it would probably be easier to build and maintain.",1416696404

This is because the best defence against bleeding is tamponade. As in, a finger applying pressure.
I work in an emergency department and recently we had a trauma patient that was bleeding. The trauma fellow was doing his assessment and a emergency consultant was getting very anxious and stating that the patient had to go to theatre right now as he was bleeding out. The trauma fellow was trying to complete his primary survey and wanted the emergency specialist to shut up so he stuck his finger in the wound, the patient stopped bleeding, and he turned around and got on with the rest of the survey.<p>The point is that bleeding is very rarely life threatening, and te couple of applications where is would be are military and intra operative.<p>The intra operative application would be particularly useful when a patient had a lacerated spleen or liver or when these organs are operated on. Currently we use a product called geloseal to stop bleeding on these organs - it works pretty well. But if this product works as suggested it may be better.<p>No-one needs this in their first aid kit, and until it is approved for use in surgery I don&#x27;t think we will save any lives with it, but it is still a very cool product.",1416694480

The meme is invoking it to dismiss a study with no further thought and no specific content.<p>Small samples get overinterpreted, many published findings are false, etc.—it&#x27;s all true and the community here is well aware. But it&#x27;s a gross overreaction to dismiss small-sample experiments wholesale. Even a few seconds&#x27; reflection is enough to see that.<p>For example, assuming this experiment was rigorous, it didn&#x27;t need more than 16 subjects to find that greater saturated fat in diet doesn&#x27;t <i>automatically</i> cause greater fat in blood. Additional resources might be better spent on future samples (i.e. replicating the finding by other researchers) than on a larger single sample, which is probably a game of rapidly diminishing returns. And so on.<p>The point is that HN wants reflective comments, not reflexive ones. It takes no work and no real thought to pick out one detail that people are currently primed to fuss over and make a post of it. That&#x27;s not reflection, it&#x27;s habit, and its payload is not learning, but reinforcement. Reflection requires engaging with the material—this specific material.<p>There are two ways to do that. One is to dig in and learn the material, think about it, and report your findings to HN. The other is to happen to know something about it in the first place. The first takes work, the second luck. Comments based on neither work nor knowledge are likely not to be substantive. That&#x27;s why want to avoid generic dismissals as opposed to specific ones.",1416693642

It also may be more reliable on some browsers (as it does not rely on the browser keeping the previous page's scripts and requests operating as you move to the next page).<p>Honestly, given the behavior of when Google chooses to deploy this feature, I believe it to be an unintended bug. I believe that Google's intention with these links is for them to work as normal: to be simple <a href=""<a href=""http://example.com/>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/></a>, and to only change as you click on them to go to the next page.<p>This would then explain why they require JavaScript: in order to pull off the feat of having the link work correctly normally but only change as you click it requires JavaScript; that then explains why they only serve this to clients that have JavaScript.<p>If you check the link out: they actually are shipped from Google as simple anchor tags. They they have an ""onmousedown"" that converts the link to a Google indirect URL only as they are clicked. With the caveat that this makes clicking the links really slow (due to the synchronous round trips to Google that sometimes even fail due to SPDY), this would seem to be ideal behavior.<p>However, right-clicking the URL, or clicking on the link and dragging it, also cause the link to be changed to the indirect URL. This could very well have simply been an oversight: a mistake caused months (even years) after they originally deployed this feature, and no one noticed or remembered it shouldn't work like that.<p>(edit: Hacker News seriously won't let me put a closing "" on the href= of my <a> example tag... :(.)",1325444119

3413525,comment,3412891,3413325,0,0,its_so_on,,,"right; very inexact metaphor.<p>It's only helpful because code doesn't LITERALLY get consumed, in the sense that if you want to run a piece of code 1000 times (ever) you need 1000 copies, and you have one less every time you run it, or every one hundred times you run it a copy disappears or whatever, like a bag of chips that disappears when you eat it, batteries that get used up (after one full discharge with nonrechargeable batteries, after a while with rechargeable ones), or paper cups as in my example.  Literally it's (in reality) very durable, it just becomes inappropriate or stop working or being effective because of the context, not the bytes themselves, which don't deteriorate.  It doesn't deteriorate or disappear like a consumable good does, you don't need to buy another bag of it when you run out, it seems to be a bag of something that never runs out: so it seems obvious that if you're going to build a bag of something that never runs out, why not make that something absolutely perfect, you know?<p>It leads to engineers buiding everything like a ship (durable good) and coding nothing (or sys-oping) nothing like something consumable that they cannot see as using forever.<p>of course the metaphor is inexact:<p>any line of code you have on a reliable medium is in the same condition (literally the same characters, literally 0 difference) as when it was last written or updated.<p>Consumable goods get consumed or deteriorate, but code seems to ""be forever"" i.e. subject only to the license imposed on it and not its physical quality; this quality leads to overengineering, given the mentality that since it will be available forever, you might as well code it ""for forever"".<p>What I'm suggesting is that sometimes it's useful to look at code as though it were bags of manure (consumable) instead of a lot of land you or apartment/house you own in perpetuity.<p>This is just for resource allocation/investment decisions an engineer is making.  A typical example is that it is VERY hard for an engineer to say, ""I will write this in this one language/framework that I know really well, and is totally inappropriate, in 10 minutes, it will be like a paper cup.  Then I'll direct resources elsewhere, and when I need a glass I will throw this cup away.""<p>The tendency is to say ""I can't fortify this paper cup, it doesn't scale, so 'why build sand castles'...""<p>I am saying that a consumable good (sand castle code) is often very appropriate given resource restrictions.  It is also often VERY inappopriate, as when people do not own a dishwasher and tableware, but buy a bag of plastic and a bag of paper plates every week and throw it out every week.  (People do live this way.)<p>It's a delicate balance; this is one tool in many in your arsenal for deciding where to allocate your resources.  I should also specify that renting a durable good might be more akin to subscribing to a web-based service or whatever.  Again, all these are analogies to help you make good time and resource investment decisions, and think of something in terms that are appropriate.  It's easy to throw out a paper plate if you bought it once as hosting a very rare party that temporarily overloaded your capacity.  It's very hard for engineers to realize that sometimes it's time to write that same paper-plate code and throw it away without ever washing it (investing more coding into it or trying to engineer a scalable architecture into it after the fact).  Things to know about what you're doing up-front so you can make informed decisions and stick to them as your ""household"" evolves.",1325443853

I quit pursing my film career for now, as the signal to noise ratio is not favorable for me here (India). Then, I bought my first computer to kill some time, to pirate some movies etc. Then I thought, I should learn web design, So, I made a decision to learn Photoshop, HTML/CSS and build cool orkut like websites in 6 months (yea I know, what a dumbass). I got upto speed in Photoshop, HTML/CSS in 6 months, (I realized, I can't make dynamic websites with HTML/CSS), then learned PHP, PHP was a mess. By, this time, I had a few clients through referrals from friends, after successfully completing the job, I thought, ""hey may be we can start a web design business"". So, Me and a friend agreed, we should start a business, so we rented the cheapest place you could find for an office space ($50 a month), and started our gig.<p>Since then, we are only 2 people, I was kind of demoralized, when I saw PHP frameworks and ugly OOPs syntax. It seemed like a lot of work. Then, I stumbled upon Ruby on Rails, I learned enough Ruby and Rails, Last year.

I remember reading a few months ago about how to do a hexdump on /dev/urandom to create a Matrix-style scroll, and to ""look busy in front of your boss"". So I did a Google search for ""look busy with /dev/urandom"" and sure enough the blog post I was looking for is the first result:<p><a href=""http://jeromenicholas.blogspot.com/2011/03/look-busy-when-your-boss-comes-around.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeromenicholas.blogspot.com/2011/03/look-busy-when-yo...</a><p>Now, I don't know if it's just the first result for me (I'd like to hear what others get), but that post doesn't come up in the first 50 results on DDG, using the same search string.

3413489,comment,3411475,3413347,0,0,peckrob,,,"I totally agree with you about the need for better drivers' training, especially in the United States. Quite frankly, my ""driving exam"" was a joke - a 5 minute drive around the courthouse square (again, I lived in a small town - cows outnumbered people where I grew up). Fortunately, my parents spent a lot of time teaching me how to handle the responsibility of driving a car.<p>Driving is a responsibility, just like owning a firearm or having root on all your company's servers. With great power comes great responsibility.<p>However, many of the items the parent mentioned, short of having an accident, are not even concerns for me and I would classify as minor inconveniences. Running out of gas is a minor inconvenience. A flat tire is a minor inconvenience (assuming you know how to change a flat, and even more minor if you don't). The others, again short of an accident, are things that are not likely to happen assuming you are aware of your surroundings. Don't park where you aren't supposed to. Don't leave valuables in plain sight - pretty much the same precautions you would take on public transit to avoid becoming a victim of crime.<p>I don't want to seem as though I'm opposed to public transit. I think it's great where it works and, if it were an option where I lived, I would probably use it when it made sense to. I was thinking about this last night and I've noticed I tend to use it more on the west coast than on the east coast. I actually like TriMet in Portland, and I've used Caltrain, VTA and BART when I'm in the Bay Area with little to no issues. But I would probably avoid the subway in NYC again and MARTA in Atlanta was one of the more terrifying experiences I've ever had as far as feeling unsafe.<p>The thing is, a large percentage of the population of the US lives in areas that have no public transit at all. Articles heralding the death of the car (like the link) tend to focus on cities, and suburban areas near them, that have adequate public transit while completely ignoring the remaining segments of the population that live in areas where public transit is not, and probably never will be, a viable option. For these areas there are simply no other options other than cars.",1325443123

See Scott Meyers' ""virtual copy constructor"" snippet half way down the page:\n<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=azvE8V0c-mYC&lpg=PT159&ots=46cf4cGhZg&pg=PT158#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=azvE8V0c-mYC&lpg=PT159&...</a><p>You can't do it that neatly without covariant return types. Ergo, you can't do that while returning safe, smart pointers.",1325441001

They then took over two months of constant hassle to actually cough up the money. Note that I didn't actually start complaining until a date was fixed etc. and they missed it, so I think your remarks about being silly are off-base.",1325440928

But note that this is a two-way street: they don't owe me anything without a contract, but neither do they have the right to use my work. Authors generally let that slide, but they are setting themselves up for a world of pain if someone objects. (I did so on the book, and suddenly they had no negotiating leverage.)",1325440847

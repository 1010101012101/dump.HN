The complaint people have about iOS is that it is locked down with regards to native apps. Mozilla themselves have made this exact complaint about iOS -- that they wanted to write a browser for iOS but could not because a) HTML/Javascript are not suitable for writing a browser so they have to go through the app store and b) native apps in the app store on iOS face restrictions that would limit performance of a Javascript VM, so Firefox would not have competitive performance compared to Safari.<p>FirefoxOS solves neither of those problems.<p>More generally, the idea of all user facing software being targeted to a single sandboxed standard API is very restrictive and worrying. It means developers giving up complete control to a small cabal of 4 or 5 large organisations that decide what gets standardised. Organisations that have conflicting interests and financial motivations that certainly don&#x27;t align with my own. That&#x27;s assuming that various competing web based platforms would even be sustainable; I don&#x27;t see it lasting more than 5 mins before platform specific extensions are added to provide additional value over the competitors.<p>I want to be able to write software for my device and have full access to the hardware without some third party being able to decide what I can and can&#x27;t do with my phone. FirefoxOS doesn&#x27;t get me any closer to that goal, in fact it&#x27;s a step backwards. Web platforms are great for SV startups where raw user numbers are the most important thing, but to be honest I don&#x27;t give a shit about the ability of the latest photo sharing startup to &#x27;exit&#x27;. I do care about people doing much more interesting things and all I can see is web based OSs being a restriction on that.

There are certain things I need when I travel that I can&#x27;t afford to go without in the case my checked bags don&#x27;t make it to my destination at the same time as me. Things such as prescription medicine, contacts and my retainer (though not nearly as important as the previous two but still important none the less) are things I always carry on because they are things I can&#x27;t easily replace if my bags are lost. Then I bring the entertainment, usually a laptop and/or a tablet and books/magazines. All of that stuff would need to be in at least one carry on.<p>Most, if not all, of the airlines I have flown have a limit to how many bags you can carry on. So it isn&#x27;t like charging for check bags is going to have people start bringing 10 carry ons, it would have them bring the max if they wanted which as far as I know is 2 for most airlines.",1373379887
6012797,comment,6012009,6012009,5,0,salmonellaeater,,,"The fact that UTF-8 and UTF-16 are often exposed to programmers when dealing with text is a major failure of separation-of-concerns. If you had a stream of data that was gzipped, would it ever make sense to look at the bytes in the data stream before decompressing it? Variable-length text encodings are the same. Application code should only see Unicode code points.<p>In general it was a mistake to put variable-length encodings into the Unicode standard. A much better design would have been to use UTF-32 for the application-level interface to characters, and use a separate compression standard that is optimized for fixed alphabets when transporting or storing text. This has the advantage that the compression scheme can be dynamically updated to match the letter frequencies in the real-world text, and it logically separates the ideas of encoding and compression so that the compression container is easier to swap out. And, of course, an entire class of bugs would be eliminated from application code.<p><i>Edited first paragraph to clarify: </i>Variable-length <i>text encodings are the same.</i>",1373379880

6012713,comment,6011659,6012522,9,0,Yoric,,,"> Android and Firefox OS both also have a VM to run managed code, along with a JIT compiler. Android&#x27;s VM, Dalvik, was specifically designed to be memory efficient in the case where several apps are running as separate Unix processes. Is the same true of SpiderMonkey?<p>Short answer: yes, SpiderMonkey has been designed to be quite memory efficient.<p>> But on top of this, Firefox OS and its apps add:<p>Actually, let me clarify something, if not for you, then for our readers: &quot;on top of this&quot; means essentially &quot;on top of the kernel and HAL,&quot; rather than &quot;on top of Android.&quot;<p>> [valid points] So how can you say that Firefox OS is more resource-efficient than Android? Perhaps the Android platform developers have gotten sloppy lately, since they&#x27;re primarily concerned about high-end phones. But that can be remedied.<p>All your technical points are valid. However, you have not taken into account the fact that Android is much larger than that not to mention, conceptually, very old. Just the Core Libraries, for instance, offer at least three or four ways of reading/writing files. Most of these APIs should be removed for the sake of performance, as they were based on Java 1.0 designs from the 1990s, a time at which industry believed that disk speed would keep improving as fast as CPU speed and that concurrency was too expensive to be used. But these APIs cannot be removed, simply because too much code depends upon them, both in Android itself and in applications that Google would not want to lose. Sadly, this means that all such code is a performance hog, especially on mobile devices, since mobile storage is horribly slow in comparison to PC storage.<p>Now, while I am less familiar with the rest of the architecture of Android, I seem to remember this is true of many features and that many features are accidentally implemented several times in the kernel, Dalvik, the libraries and/or the frameworks, in the interest of (partial) compatibility with Posix, Linux, J2SE, etc and tutorials.<p>While it would theoretically be possible to get rid of all these inter-layer duplications, and to only keep the good APIs, this effectively means breaking too much of both Android itself and of many applications. Google cannot afford to do that, as they would risk driving away all developers and users. Moreover, Google does not need to do that, as Android has always been targeted towards high-end phones. A new operating system, by opposition, with everything to win and nothing to lose, can start from a blank state. Moreover, since Firefox OS offers only high-level APIs and no NDK-style access, it is easier and will remain easier for a number of years, to perform whichever low-level refactorings are necessary to improve performance and/or memory efficiency without breaking applications.<p>Note that this is almost the reverse of Chrome vs. Firefox. Firefox is burdened by the number of add-ons that need to be supported, and the low-level APIs provided to these add-ons, while Chrome, starting with a blank slate and restricted public APIs, managed to rise the stakes of performance quite harshly.",1373379054

When the flight recorders were finally found (an astounding feat of salvage BTW), it turned out that the airspeed indicators did fail...but then they came back online, and the pilots flew a perfectly good aircraft into the ocean anyway.<p>So as we look at this SFO crash, the lessons from Air France are mixed. On the one hand it&#x27;s possible that the early theories of pilot error will be wrong, and it will be some subtle or previously unknown software or hardware error. On the other hand we know that modern highly trained pilots <i>can</i> make enough wrong decisions in a row to crash a sound airplane.",1373379054

6012671,comment,6011659,6012522,9,0,soapdog,,,"mwcampbell,<p>Thanks for your reply. =D<p>In the high-end market, it doesn&#x27;t matter, everyone is good. In the low-end market, Firefox OS has better performance than Android.<p>From a high level analysis, your comment appears spot on but unfortunately it is not that simple. Dalvik VM is GREAt and we all know the bad parts of JS. The problem is that there is a lot going on on android phones. Its not as if there is only Dalvik and your app. In Firefox OS Gecko is so close to the hardware that it doesn&#x27;t need to go thru hops. Firefox OS can be said to be nothing but a browser running on bare metal. Android is not slow, but on low-end hardware it is not as responsive as it should be. Pick a Galaxy Ace for example, its specs are similar to ZTE Open (ZTE Open has better specs) and the price is similar but the experience is much better and more responsive on ZTE Open.<p>Dalvik was created to be efficient, and it is. My comment is not about Dalvik being bad, it is not. Its about low end phones running android offering a bad experience. I don&#x27;t know if you ever used those phones or if you ever tried a Firefox OS phone.<p>> Hacks on top to turn this combination of hypertext markup language and poorly designed programming language into a tolerable UI toolkit and application platform<p>HTML evolved. The current standards and practices are pretty good. Check out new JS proposals, the language is evolving and becoming better. While you may perceive the combination of HTML/CSS/JS as something horrible, others like it. Check out enyojs at <a href=""http://enyojs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://enyojs.com</a> for example, it is a great framework for app development that shows the potential for pure web based solutions.<p>As you said:<p>> What matters is that, as far as I can tell, the Android platform was designed for efficiency, while the Web platform was not.<p>And yet, the web runs pretty well inside a browser in Android right? Even with all Android around it, open web apps running in a browser (when built correctly) do pretty great. Now remove Android and just leave the browser. Imagine how much complexity went away. How much CPU cycles and memory you saved if you have nothing but a web runtime.<p>We all agree that Android is a great platform. As I said, this is not an attack on Android. Firefox OS is a return to simplicity where you have just a web based architecture that is being optimized and refactored into a great mobile platform. We&#x27;re not picking Desktop Firefox and shoehorning it into a mobile device. Firefox OS is being built for mobile.<p>You certainly know your tech and so I will leave you with an invitation. Android development is not open, Google releases new versions of Android when it wants to and then you see the source code. Even so, Android is hard to hack. On the other hand, Firefox OS is developed in the open. All source code, including whats is being worked on is live on github.<p>Better than me sprouting opinions and experiences here is for knowledgeable people such as you to check the code out. See how it is being built and how things work together. Help shape a better platform for everyone. Everyone is encouraged to contribute to Firefox OS. If you think SpiderMonkey (or IonMonkey or OdinMonkey) is slow, help improve it, we could all use some help! :D<p><a href=""https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/</a><p>As I said, one of the key thinks about Firefox OS is how open it is. Want to try to develop new features? Check out the repo, hack away and if it good enough, talk about a pull request on IRC.<p>If you want to check out the system without building it, pick the Firefox OS Simulator, it is just a add-on for Firefox at <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/firefox-os-simulator/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/firefox-os-simulato...</a><p>For example, you will notice that we use the Android kernel and parts of Android SDK tools such as adb and fastboot. The cool think about open source is that you can reuse the good bits and not use what you don&#x27;t want to.<p>So I invite you to check out the platform. The web may appear badly designed and not build for performance but there are more and more people working on it and it just grows and surprises us. No one believed in JS for gaming until people saw the unreal engine running inside the browser without plugins. JS and its friends will keep improving and cross-plaform open solutions tend to win in the long run.",1373378518

6012668,comment,6012400,6012400,2,0,kellros,,,"Thanks for sharing, I agree with the points you made. The only thing I would add is that not everything is testable in the sense of given: input, expect: output.<p>A common scenario I encounter is that sometimes when you are refactoring a method and refactoring it into multiple methods (for better readability or segregation); that you are required to make the new (sub) methods publicly available for testing purposes. This goes against the intention of improving readability because now you have to expose certain methods that you would rather haven&#x27;t be called independently. In such way, TDD helps identify artifacts with too many responsibilities.<p>The best tip I can think of to give someone approaching/doing TTD is to make a check-list beforehand of what you are trying to achieve. This helps to focus your attention on usage patterns and identify &#x27;end-points&#x27; (end points being testable artifacts). Just because you&#x27;re doing TDD, doesn&#x27;t mean you don&#x27;t have to have a plan to start with.",1373378426

Some business centers offer small company. They offer furnished office space that has telephone, fax, and receptionist services. \nWhen you are a virtual assistant, you should work in an ongoing relationship with your clients as people who you are working with daily. You should have to get closer with your client as you become the right hand of the client that you are assisted. You have to know about his/her business, family and life experiences in order to build a continuous relationship. You should have to share also about your personal life experiences if possible so that your client can also relate with your backgrounds as his/her business partner because the more knowledge and learning you give to clients, the more they will be able to support you in the future and will give value to you as well.  You also do secretarial works but even more than that, like some personal matters, you should have to do what the client demanded as a partner. You should always create value to your clients through a professional and dynamic process of learning. \nA virtual assistant can also be described as a special job because of the kind of relationship build between a VA and a client. For me, this kind of job is very much exciting and challenging because you will know several people in some several foreign places that you are able to learn much more than what you expected ahead of time.",1309409016

It's about popularity. It's social. It's cute. It's flash-based. And yet, damn it, I am having so much fun with it. Even in rooms built around specific web communities that therefore cause music to run anywhere from techno to hip-hop, to 80s music, to <i>Smell Yo Dick</i> to . . . yes . . . tracks from Steve Martin's banjo performances.<p>I've participated in multi-hour long ""songs with a space theme"" mixes. I've participated in 90s night. I've participated in bouts of idiocy where we just try to drive a room full of people (and ourselves) nuts playing the most obnoxious songs.<p>And it's just a damn good time. The best part is that even if someone plays something I don't care for, at least I know it's something a human being who likes the song chose as opposed to the automation of every radio station on earth.<p>Over time, I hope they improve how you build your playlist. Maybe given you the option to have multiple lists and a better way to search and organize them. Maybe improve the chat function. Make the interface better (it's just so tiny and limited, right now). Maybe move to HTML5 or something other than Flash. Add some hotkeys, instead of mouse-only.<p>Over time, there will be just a handful of very targeted rooms and then lots of tiny rooms build around communities that have less musical coherence. I think it's bound to get better over time. If not, the next person to come along will surely improve upon it.

2712515,comment,2708595,2712442,2,0,jacques_chester,,,"Complexity.<p>The law isn't complex for the sake of it. The law is complex because the world is complex (cf. essential and accidental complexity). A single person is complex and hard to model reliably -- sure, you can get the first 90% right, but that's not enough. Then you scale that up to pairs of people, people in families, people in businesses and so on.<p>Law tries hard, <i>very</i> hard, to boil this intractably vast variety down into general, abstract systems. But corner cases frequently arise that don't <i>quite</i> fit the current rules. The rules need to extended by analogy, or broken, or turned inside out, or ignored, or not ... in order to make it work. Every once in a while enough of these little oddities accumulate that a new generality can be perceived.<p>But, like any model, the first 90% is easy. Everything else is recursively more difficult as you go into sub-sub-sub-sub categories where millions of dollars or people's lives and freedom can turn on a tiny distinction that only humans could, currently, tease out.<p>I did not come to think of law this way while studying law. It was when I began writing software that I realised how complex the world really is. How difficult it is to change established, complex systems.<p>The computer is a useful brute, but not too bright. Explaining all those corner cases, all those once-in-a-turquoise-moon exceptions in nauseating detail, is a useful lesson in humility.",1309407077

Microsoft designed Direct3D with games in mind and  the culture surrounding OpenGL gave priority to productivity applications for engineering and design as is appropriate for something that was developed by Silicon Graphics.<p>The characterization of Microsoft being disorganized because they were working on OpenGL at the same time as Direct3D is a direct result of misunderstanding this difference. Microsoft had to address to entirely different markets: gamers for whom high frame rates were much more important than fidelity  and engineers for whom accurate rendering was important (Even today, high end graphics cards for Windows workstations run OpenGL.)<p>[<a href=""http://www.nvidia.com/object/autocad_pd_perf_drivers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nvidia.com/object/autocad_pd_perf_drivers.html</a>]\n[<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_engine#Reducing_3D_complexity_to_increase_speed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_engine#Reducing_3D_comple...</a>]<p>3dLabs involvement with the development of improvements to OpenGL is symptomatic of OpenGL's emphasis on fidelity in rendering and the legacy of SGI from whence it evolved. The slow pace was perfectly acceptable to a group of serious people who care about standards and don't care about games.<p>3dLabs is also an example of the distinct segmentation of the consumer and engineering market for graphic cards in the PC market.

10721621,comment,10720176,10721073,0,0,astrofinch,,,"It might be useful to differentiate between technological equilibria that favor either attackers or defenders.<p>* Two guys with pistols in a crowded bar: Attacker is favored.<p>* Trench warfare during WWI: Defender is favored.<p>* Nukes: Attacker is favored, although with the invention of nuclear submarines that could lurk under the ocean and offer credible retaliation even in the event of a devastating strike, the attacker became favored less.<p>In general equilibria where the defender is favored seem better.  Venice became one of the wealthier cities in the medieval world because it was situated in a lagoon that gave it a strong defensive advantage.  The Chinese philosopher Mozi was one of the first consequentialist philosophers; during the Warring States period his followers went around advancing the state of the art in defensive siege warfare tactics: <a href=""http://www.tor.com/2015/02/09/let-me-tell-you-a-little-bit-about-the-mohists/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tor.com/2015/02/09/let-me-tell-you-a-little-bit-a...</a><p>Notably, I&#x27;m told that computer security current favors attackers in most areas: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/dq9/work_on_security_instead_of_friendliness/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/dq9/work_on_security_instead_of_frie...</a> (BTW the author of this post is a potential Satoshi Nakamoto candidate and knows his stuff.)<p>In equilibria where the attacker is favored, the best solution is to have some kind of trusted central power with a monopoly on force that keeps the peace between everyone.  That&#x27;s what a modern state looks like.  Even prisoners form their own semiformal governing structures, with designated ruling authorities, to deal with the fact that prison violence favors the attacker: <a href=""http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2015/03/david_skarbek_o.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2015/03/david_skarbek_o.htm...</a><p>Thought experiment: Let&#x27;s say someone invents a personal force field that grants immunity to fists and bullets.  In this world you can imagine that the need for a police force, and therefore the central state authority that manages the use of this police force, lessens considerably.  The enforcement powers available to a central government also lessen considerably.<p>This is somewhat similar to the situation with online communities.  We don&#x27;t have a central structure governing discussions on the web because online communities favor the defender.  It&#x27;s relatively easy to ban users based on their IP address or simply lock new users out of your forum entirely and therebye keep the troll mobs out.  Hence the internet gives us something like Scott Alexander&#x27;s idea of &quot;Archipelago&quot; where people get to be a part of the community they want (and deserve): <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-...</a>  Note the work done by the word &quot;archipelago&quot; which implies islands that are easy to defend and hard to attack (like Venice).<p>Let&#x27;s assume that superintelligent AI, when weaponized, shoves us into an entirely new and unexplored conflict equilibrium.<p>If the new equilibrium favors defense we&#x27;d like to give everyone AIs so they can create their own atomic communities.  If only a few people have AIs, they might be able to monopolize AI tech and prevent anyone else from getting one, though the info could leak eventually.<p>If the new equilibrium favors offense we&#x27;d like to keep AIs in the hands of a small set of trusted, well-designed institutions--the same way we treat nuclear weapons.  It could be that at the highest level of technological development, physics overwhelmingly favors offense.  If everyone has AIs there&#x27;s the possibility of destructive anarchy.  In this world, research on the design of trustworthy, robust, inclusive institutions (to manage a monopoly on AI-created power) could be seen as AI safety research.<p>The great filter <a href=""http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html</a> weakly suggests that the new equilibrium favors offense.  If the new equilibrium favors defense, even the &quot;worst case scenario&quot; autocratic regimes would have had plenty of time to colonize the galaxy by now.  If the new equilibrium favors offense, it&#x27;s entirely possible that civs reaching the superintelligent AI stage always destroy themselves in destructive anarchy and go no further.  But the great filter is a very complicated topic and this line of reasoning has caveats, e.g. see <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/m2x/resolving_the_fermi_paradox_new_directions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/m2x/resolving_the_fermi_paradox_new_...</a><p>Anyway this entire comment is basically spitballing... point is that if $1B+ is going to be spent on this project, I would like to see at least a fraction of this capital go towards hammering issues like these out.  (It&#x27;d be cool to set up an institute devoted to studying the great filter for instance.)  As Enrico Fermi said:<p>&quot;History of science and technology has consistently taught us that scientific advances in basic understanding have sooner or later led to technical and industrial applications that have revolutionized our way of life... What is less certain, and what we all fervently hope, is that man will soon grow sufficiently adult to make good use of the powers that he acquires over nature.&quot;<p>And I&#x27;m slightly worried that by virtue of choosing the name OpenAI, the team has committed themselves to a particular path without fully thinking it through.",1449889196

They are simply explicit and blunt examples to make a point, more relatable examples would be traditional models of miasma causing disease or of the Earth being flat. But you also reinforce my point - it <i>feels</i> more explicit when the consequences of a misguided social order have physical ramifications in the immediate, rather than the sociological spanning the entirety over a long time. Probably the greatest relatable yet poignant example would be the cultural view of women as helpless or lesser than men for most of history since cultivation of crops began. It started as a tool of control, and was passed down in an ingrained psyche we have still not fully escaped. But we can fully understand both that people borne into it assumed it to be an absolute of the world, the same as how many think copyright and intellectual property <i>must</i> be, while also recognizing how wrong they can be.<p>> Almost everyone I&#x27;ve ever discussed copyright with is perfectly capable of appreciating the systemic perpetuation of privilege that inheres in copyright monopolies. You&#x27;re waving a bloody shirt for the moral equivalent of a paper cut; it&#x27;s not OK to borrow the vastly more intense sufferings of others to make more of an emotional impact.<p>This is <i>also</i> the point. It is not about the privilege of the owners, it is about the damage inflicted by it. It is not about money earned but history, knowledge, and potential lost. You can see the immediate consequences of slavery, but also recognize that such a sin of culture has consequences in the potential of everyone involved beyond the subjugated. If a debate on copyright devolves into pursuits of wealth or privilege, the macro impact is already lost. In addition, anyone you are having a debate with is probably already putting in the effort. I speak of the other 99% of peoples who give it no consideration and assume it as natural as gravity or light.<p>And I&#x27;m not claiming to be some enlightened saint. As others have said, these flaws in social organization of peoples require mental effort to grasp and overcome. You always want to presume what you know is what is right, and I am certain I have my own assumptions that are as moralistically wrong as copyright that I have not yet, or may never, challenge. And hopefully whatever we are in that thousand years looks back and sees them all as backwards and unreasonable as we see so many historical practices as wrong.",1449888548

I implemented (one of?) the only major carrier settlement capable applications prior to this ban for a preloaded flagship application for Samsung in 2010. We billed AT&T and T-Mobile, both of which had almost the same API for client billing running through the Israeli (now apparently rebranding to appear American) company AMDOCS. (The rumours are true: by providing &#x27;outsourced billing&#x27; they can basically spy on most mobile networks&#x27; customers... read the public portion of their client list sometime) Anyway, we were already doing pay by text (a carrier-specific configuration) for many years all over the world before that. There are providers who set up these integrations for you and provide global multi-market pay-by-SMS services, but the problem is that the average mobile carrier does not have a unified view of its customer: particularly pre-pay and post-pay customers may be subject to very different limitations on pay-by-text availability and maximum charges. Then there&#x27;s backend settlement, often time-staggered on a monthly basis and incorporating exchange rate risk exposure, etc. It&#x27;s a PITA to do manually for multi-market, but a real solution (settlement method neutral and incorporating the real qualities of a settlement chain, including risk, legal jurisdiction for issue resolution, insurance, maximum and minimum settlement time, maximum and minimum volume, supported asset types, etc.) has been indefinitely deferred by the likes of Google who seem happy enough to cozy up to the existing financial establishment instead of rocking the boat.

I applied to a couple dozen positions (mostly asking for more experience than I have), had interviews with a decent number of them, and was eventually  hired for a position that had asked for a lot more experience than I had. Turned out they hadn&#x27;t managed to interview anyone at the seniority level they wanted and decided to go with their best interviewee rather than go through another search (at a big place where HR mandates searches as a waterfall process to use a SDLC analogy).

This means it&#x27;s rather difficult to get data races, deadlocks, etc. Go&#x27;s scheduler certainly does not give you that, trades it for spreading work over different cpus.<p>So it has problems:<p>1) necessity of locking, using IPC mechanisms, ... (like preemptive schedulers, and let&#x27;s face facts here : channels aren&#x27;t enough in real world apps)<p>2) everything gets blocked by large calculations (like cooperative schedulers)<p>3) more generally, easy to crash by misbehaving thread due to unrestricted access shared resources (not just cpu) (like cooperative schedulers)<p>And advantages:<p>1) Actually uses multiple cpu&#x27;s/cores/... (like preemptive schedulers)<p>2) integrated event loop that scales (like cooperative schedulers)<p>If you want to see a programming language with a &quot;scheduler&quot; that doesn&#x27;t have the bad parts of cooperative schedulers, check out Erlang. If you attempt to crash erlang with infinite loops, bad memory allocation, ... (on a properly configured system) that just won&#x27;t work, the offending threads/&quot;goroutines&quot; crash leaving the rest of your program running fine. The offending threads will restart if you configure them to do so (which is really easy).<p>The same can be achieved, with much more work, on the JVM, or, also with much more work, with python&#x27;s &quot;multiprocessing&quot; library, part of the standard library.<p>> > On the linux scheduler with proper ulimits it&#x27;s bloody hard to crash the system, for instance, forkbombs, memory bombs, ... won&#x27;t do it.

It is not clear what &quot;crash&quot; means here, and it is not clear how it would apply to a runtime environment. All that stuff, forkbombs, etc, means that you can configure the system so arbitrary code can&#x27;t affect the system in those particular ways.<p>Crash means that the system/&quot;program&quot; doesn&#x27;t respond (in a useful manner) anymore.",1449887964

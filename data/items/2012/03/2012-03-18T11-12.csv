There are a lot of things that you can cut from a product to make it minimal. I don't believe quality is one of them.

3719549,comment,3718508,3718508,3,0,bbx,,,"I have a question about the way keyboard shortcuts are implemented: are the keys mostly chosen for their value or their position?<p>For example (and please correct me if I'm mistaken), ""Copy"" is ""C"" because it's the first letter, and ""X"" is ""Cut"" because it looks like scissors. But ""V"" was chosen because it's next to the two others, despite not hinting at ""Paste"" at all.<p>The reason I come up with that question is that I use a French keyboard (AZERTY) which modifies a dozen of key positions, and it makes some shortcuts hard to execute. Sometimes, they're even <i>impossible</i> to execute. For example, the numbers row needs SHIFT to type a number. In QWERTY, to get a ""1"" you just type ""1"" but on AZERTY you type ""SHIFT+&"".<p>I'm sure other international keyboard layouts have the same issue and wondered how those who implement those shortcuts deal with that.",1332071618

3719539,comment,3718928,3718928,2,0,CPlatypus,,,"I really wish they'd give more information about their methodology.  For example, I've used the SoD SSD servers for some of my own testing, and they pull 30K IOPS for small random synchronous writes.  How does that translate to ""361.62""?  WTF are the units here?  What workload were they even testing?  Yes, I know they list the random grab bag of tools they're using, but most of those are capable of generating many different kinds of I/O and they don't say what arguments they used.  ""361.62"" seems very precise.  I'm sure the two digits after the decimal point really impress the pithed snails or MBAs who are the benchmarkers' apparent target market.  However, given both the bogosity of combining disparate measurements like this and the well known variability over time of cloud performance, that precision is not justified.  Numbers that are more precise than they are accurate or meaningful are just decoration.<p>P.S. I expect someone will ask for more specifics, so here are a few.  First, Bonnie++ sucks.  Many of the numbers it produces measure the memory system or the libc implementation more than the actual I/O system.  I've seriously gotten more testing value from building it than running it, so its very presence taints the result.  Second, fio/hdparm/iozone might be redundant, according to which arguments are used.  Or the results might be non-comparable.  Either way, the aggregate result could only apply to an application with exactly that (unspecified) balance of read vs. write, sequential vs. random, sync vs. async, file counts and sizes, etc.  Did they even run tests over enough data to get past caching effects?  That's particularly important since they used different memory sizes on different providers.  Similarly, what thread counts did they use on these different numbers of CPUs/cores?  Same across all, or best-performing for each component benchmark?  With such sloppy methodology anything less than an order-of-magnitude difference doesn't even tell you which platforms to test yourself.",1332071116
3719538,comment,3714269,3718839,2,0,Produce,,,"As another anecdote for the lack of social mobility that the vast majority of people experience, how many people born into wealth has anyone witnessed transition into the working class? What's the ratio of that population to people born into wealth who stay wealthy? Just as it is extremely difficult to be born poor and end up rich, so it is the other way round. People often forget the ever looming hidden factors in these situations; morale and mind-set. From all of the research I've done on what makes people successful, it's all in the mind. From all the research I've done on what makes people change, it's all in the environment. In other words, mindset is intimately linked with the conditions one finds himself in which in turn dictate actions. A nuance of this is that mind-set also modifies environment which, in turn, affects mind-set again. It's a self-modifying system; the feedback loop that is your consciousness.<p>This is all hardly surprising - just as individual physical particles have inertia, so do we.",1332071057

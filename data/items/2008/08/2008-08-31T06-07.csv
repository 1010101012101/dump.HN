Even if the browser does stop sending cookies to google, they could do pretty good tracking based on useragent/ip.<p>However, a browser that doesn't support cookies correctly, isn't very useful.<p>The browsers history is completely irrelevant.<p>From the article: ""others using the same computer will not be able to see which sites have been accessed.""<p>That is not the same as ""Cookies sent from google will no longer work""",1220164273

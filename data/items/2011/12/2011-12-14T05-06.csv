Python I believe also closes over self as a variable, and Ruby has similar behavior for local procs, even though  self  is a special form in Ruby.<p>This is in distinct contrast to JavaScript, where the value of the special form  this  goes nuts inside closures because it's attached to the function:<p><pre><code>    foo = { x: 3 };
    foo.bar = function(baz) {
        return function(thud) {

The reasons are very similar to yours, and I got some results from it.<p>1) I was very less popular than I thought. Even 3 months after, some people says "" really, did you really quit facebook?"". This shows me that maybe the 'socialization' and be friends with everybody was not true. People only care about themselves, and care if you liked their pictures and their stories.<p>2) I'm treated weird. ""Why you don't have facebook???"". And I have to come with a new story. Most of my male colleagues says that was because of my girlfriend( Here in brazil, for some reason, the man is supposed to have more than one girl).<p>3) I feel more free and less-overwhelmed. Man, Why do I need to know that Gabriela's Uncle in hospital? And Why do I need to know that your last trip to argentina was so amazing and you  met all those beautiful girls? Well, now I don't know those things anymore, and dont miss it.<p>4) My friends have to reach me by the old channels. I'm receiving more email and sms messages. In facebook I had 700 friends. Now I have fewer friends ( of course!) but I'm so close to them, that I dont miss the other 680 that stayed in facebook.<p>Of course there are things that I miss, like when I went to a party and met new people, I think "" man, I should friend them to facebook"". But I don't anymore. If I got to be friends, I will met them personally. And I miss some events, people now create an facebook event, and invite all their friend list. Of course they will not remember you, they just invited everyone!<p>Anyway, I feel better for quitting facebook, and once and for all, twitter is still up and is a greater communication tool for me.

By language, I mean all the nuanced understandings, cultural concepts, non-verbal stuff that is impossible to gain without being in it. And, as an adult I'm still learning.<p>One example that I've recently become frighteningly aware of is that I have a vastly different understanding of what 'property' means than those who came from middle class US cultures. It's taken many years for me to understand this because in fact I know and understand the English definition of property as well as my counterparts. But, there are subtle differences in meaning that fundamentally filter my perspective. For instance, I never understood why my college friends became upset when I borrowed things and never returned them, nor why they thought it bizzare that I'd tell them, of my stuff, to just keep it.<p>There are countless other examples.  The article particularly makes me think of my adult friends and their relationships, in and out, rarely 'settling down' from an outsider view. But, just because they get divorced a lot and re-married, or cheat a lot, etc. It doesn't mean that their social conventions are any less valid than those of the middle class America.

The colon syntax is just syntactic sugar -- self isn't actually bound.<p>function Foo:Bar(baz) is the same as Foo.Bar = function(self, baz); invoking Foo:Bar(""rebar"") is sugar for Foo.Bar(Foo, ""rebar""). self is never bound - it's just passed in (explicitly, via . syntax, or implicitly, vs : syntax). In all cases, the caller is always specified.<p>You can pass Foo.Bar around (as it's a function reference), but if you have something like:<p><pre><code>    Foo = {}
    function Foo:Bar(baz)
        print(baz)
    end

    local baz = Foo.Bar
</code></pre>
Then baz has no binding information to Foo; defining the function with the : syntax is just syntactic sugar. To invoke, you would have to call:<p><pre><code>    baz(Foo, ""woohoo"")

Just calling<p><pre><code>    baz(""woohoo"")

populates self with ""woohoo"", and the bar parameter would be nil, demonstrating that there is no contextual binding to the function itself.",1323839232

Piracy isn't stealing, it's copyright infringement.<p>I'm still curious about the bandwidth costs. 110, 000 people is 110, 000 gigabytes which is 110 Tb of bandwidth. How much does that cost??<p>Also, since some of the torrenters did indeed pay for the video, they can be included as profit and they didn't add to the bandwidth costs. They were also a small amount, 10k is listed as the number of downloaders on one site. That's 10,000 out of 120,000 people who downloaded using torrents. That's around 8.3% That's really not bad at all and I'm thinking that this is the case for many things. And like I said, some of those people did pay for the video which bumps that percentage down; I would say down to 8% if you're a pessimist, and down to 5% if you're an optimist ;-)<p>Anyway, piracy isn't a problem here.

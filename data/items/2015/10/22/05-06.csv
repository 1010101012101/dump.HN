When you need to <i>reason</i> about the details about a complex system, all analogies fall apart. The juries need to reason about details in a complex system and comparing Twitter to a &quot;car engine&quot; won&#x27;t help a lay person understand why Twitter&#x27;s fictional database layer is deadlocking and why the repair function shouldn&#x27;t run during a transaction.<p>><i>If your car pollutes more than other cars and runs on the blood of innocent consumers, hiding that in the explanation of how a regular car works is not an excuse.</i><p>I think the takeaway here, is in the real world cars don&#x27;t visibly run on the blood of innocent consumers. The means of procurement of gasoline is wrapped up in many different corporations, industries and nation-states which makes it incredibly difficult to ascertain blame.<p>I could make the argument that your volkswagen runs on the blood of innocent servants in Saudi Arabia.

Some define it as someone of one culture adopting qualities of another culture wholesale- which begs the question then, what&#x27;s the difference between that and appreciating another culture?<p>Others define it as adopting said culture in a disrespectful way. This ends up closer to a mark I could understand and be on board with- but then you get situations like that defined in this article, where so much of the complaints seem to be on another&#x27;s behalf.<p>In general, I&#x27;m not sure how the concept of cultural appropriation lasts into the future as anything more than a way to steer people away from letting their ignorance walk over another culture&#x27;s traditions. Considering how quickly sacred cows are slaughtered in modern pop culture, in nearly every technologically-engaged culture on earth, it seems just so difficult to not have the phrase lose what little meaning it might have.<p>Then again, I know that I&#x27;m ignorant on many pieces of this subject, despite dozens of hours reading and trying to educate myself on it.

This way an artist can spot T-junctions, irregularly shaped model, too much density, too less (other things I don&#x27;t get, but they do)<p>- LOD (Level of detail). This usually comes at different stages - e.g. initially your outsource would do the highest (or lowest LOD), and then progress. But you need to be able to see them.<p>- Annotations/Comments - ways to select, leave comments feedback what you like, or what the outsourcing artist may ask.

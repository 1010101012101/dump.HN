226002,comment,225396,225396,0,0,thwarted,,,"""They asked various political leaders and generals to evaluate the probability that the USA would withdraw its ambassador from the Soviet Union. They then asked the same people to evaluate the probability that both (a) The USSR would invade Poland AND (b) as a consequence, the USA would withdraw its ambassador from the USSR.""<p>This seems to be worded funny, such that it is easy to misconstrue that as the conditional ""If the USSR invades Poland, THEN the USA would withdraw its ambassador"".  That is, the consequence is not viewed as separate from the condition if the subject considers the consequence as the only possibility of the condition, then the condition portion occurring alone and the condition and the consequence occurring have exactly the same likelyhood in people's minds.  After all, the consequence has no reason to occur if the condition isn't met.  The USSR invades Poland and it snows in Florida are two events that, if taken together, have a smaller chance of being true than either of them occurring independently.",1214293865

225995,comment,225764,225938,0,0,zenspider,,,"You're quoting Larry ""I've done more than anyone to fuck up programming languages"" Wall as an authority on programer clarity?!? Um... no?<p>here are some examples from real python (twisted)... let's see how much clearer they are than anything else:<p><pre><code>  ''.join([''.join(['\x1b[' + str(n) + ch for n in ('', 2, 20, 200)]) for ch in 'BACD'])\n  ''.join([''.join(['\x1b' + g + n for n in 'AB012']) for g in '()'])\n  msgs = [os.path.join(b, mail.maildir._generateMaildirName()) for b in ('cur', 'new') for x in range(5)]\n</code></pre>\nIt is code like this that makes me run for the hills... Even ignoring the list comprehensions, I use join as an example of how python gets everything backwards...<p><pre><code>  ary.join(', ')  # ruby   - oop: tell the array to join its elements with a str\n  join(', ', ary) # perl   - fun: join ary with a str\n  ', '.join(ary)  # python - wtf: tell the str to join the elements of some other ary?!?</code></pre>",1214293401

225989,comment,224861,224861,0,0,bokonist,,,"I agree with most of his criticisms, but disagree strongly with his conclusion.  My main beef with the Ivy League is that it neither trains people to be productive nor broadens minds.  I don't really don't think it's possible for a government funded institution to broaden minds ( and yes, even the Ivy's have massive amounts of government subsidies).  The professors in the humanities and social sciences act much more like an insular priesthood than purveyors of free thought ( which is not surprising considering the origins of the university and the selection process of professors).  Comments on news.yc show far more free thought than I found in sections at Yale.  I also do not think Joe carpenters' tax dollars should be subsidizing Yalie English literature majors. It's amazing how professors advocate that the government should do more to tax the rich and give to the poor, while never realizing that state funding for higher education is among the most regressive government spending that exists.<p>The university functions essentially as a gatekeeper to various credentialized professions ( scientist, professor, doctor, lawyer, civil service).  As gatekeeper, it really does not need to educate you.  Students have been selected for high enough IQ that they will learn what they need in grad school or on the job.  The school's main job is to teach you to love the school, that the school is responsible for everything good in your life, and that the school makes you special.  That way, when you end up making money, you will be sure to send money back to the school that was responsible for such happy times.",1214292973

If you'll recall, in the late 19th century farmers in the United States wanted to legalize silver as currency because deflation was making it hard for them to pay back their mortgages.",1214292781

Yes it does seem to be pretty expensive to print up the physical magazines.<p>I'm liking the idea of getting it in an area where the readers may not have access to the internet (specifically plane rides). If I know I'm going to be on the plane for 4 hours and I can't use my laptop for the internet, what better way to calm the panic than by having a magazine full of 10-15 or so blogs that I can read?",1214292183

Let me explain.<p>1) Why does everyone think that they'll have trouble from blogs for republishing?  It's huge extra exposure - I feel that you'll get tons of people interested.<p>2) Go away from publishing blog posts to stories about the bloggers (egos), about how they started their idea, features on getting started, new stories by bloggers, etc.  The TOPIC is blogging, not the posts that they've written.  Remember that and you have your focus.<p>3) It's simply not a topic covered by any major magazine<p>The bad -<p>1) Magazines are indeed dying.  Ad revenues are down and continue to drop.<p>2) It's ironic to cover such a new media with such an old one and the irony will hit people as they read it.<p>3) You're going to need a good deal of money to start this up and do circulation.",1214291145

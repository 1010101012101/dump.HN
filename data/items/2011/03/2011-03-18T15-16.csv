Or learn you some iPhone/'roid programming so you can earn some $ on the side.<p>Or manage your investment protfolio.<p>Robert Kiosaki (of Rich Dad/Poor Dad fame) in one of his books gives a couple of examples of people who became millionaires while working for the man and collecting mediocre paychecks.  Both were in jobs with plenty of downtime or waiting around for other people.  One was a fireman who would read the financial news/stock reports looking for bargain stocks, the other was (I think) working for the Postal Service and he would spend his 20% time looking for real estate bargains.<p>Alternately, you could start preparing now for your next job.<p>I worked one time for a boss that I really didn't see eye to eye with (his behaviour included being intoxicated at work to give you an idea).  The company had done some semi-disastrous change over of an old reliable minicomputer that customers would access directly via modem to some new fangled dodgy and unreliable web based system.  So to punish me for not sucking up to my boss, I got stuck in another building with no computer and had to take phone calls of people complaining bitterly about this.  Basically our script boiled down to figuring out which browser they had, and then walking them through the upgrade to the latest version, and if that didn't fix whatever problem they were having, there wasn't anything we could do.<p>I was, of course, mortally offended.  Tech support?  The lowest of the low?  the janitors of IT?  <i>ptooiee</i><p>But at the time I was reading through 7 habits and got to the bit about the guy in the concentration camp who decided that the only person that could decide whether he was unhappy was himself.<p>Anyway, that humbled me a bit.  Tech support might not be glamourous, but it's certainly no death machine.<p>So I decided to enjoy it, even though I had to deal with angry people who had nothing to do.  During the downtime I worked on adventures for Shadowrun or AD&D or something like that, basically just doodling.  It filled up the time pretty fast.  When someone angry would call I would empathise with them a lot more (which calms them down really quick), and I'd be apologetic that they'd been put in that situation by my company.<p>Eventually my evil ex-boss figured out that I was actually enjoying the tech support.  So he took me off it, and gave me <i>nothing</i> to do.  So then what I did was I took to wandering around, asking other people how they were doing, helping other programmers debug their code (there's something semi-magical about sitting down at the code they've been banging their head against and then indenting their code properly... half the time they suddenly see the problem, the other half the time it gives you time to figure out what the problem is but to them it looks like you find the problem instantaneously :D )<p>I'd also put my hand up for any work in obscure and dreadful old languages, things Man Was Not meant To Know.  you know, like COBOL or C++  :D  In a sufficiently large and sufficiently old organisation there's a surprising amount of that stuff lurking in the background that desperately needs maintenance.",1300463586

2340795,comment,2340732,2340732,0,0,mindcrime,,,"That is one awesome story, congrats!  I was especially struck by some of the stuff you said about product/market fit.  To me, this bit is pure gold:<p><i>We started engaging with our prospects on what they were currently using and what problems they were facing. In many cases people were telling us clearly what they really wanted to see in their customer support software.</i><p>Yeah, that's the key, right? Actually engaging with the customers and finding out what problem they're really trying to solve.  This cuts to the core of sgblank's Customer Development stuff and the whole Lean Startup movement.<p><i>We were surprised to see that a lot of what customers wanted were their core problems solved and not some fancy features of supporting customers from their Facebook wall or converting tweets into customer support tickets. While we understand that these are definitely the way of the future, many many customers do not need this today.</i><p>Heh, perfect example of how us techies can get caught upin the fancy, glitzy, ""cool"" stuff and maybe not realize that customers are not so concerned about that, as they are getting work done.  Really, really good reminder to focus on the customer's needs!<p><i>Another important learning for us was that customers did not want to be dealing with separate invoices for their helpdesk, their contact management software, for their customer feedback forums and customer satisfaction surveys. The SMB customer wants one invoice and as much functionality as possible in the customer relationship management solution.</i><p>That's gold too... It reminds me that sometimes the ""problem"" isn't so much a technical problem, as a structural problem with the existing business arrangements.   Wanting one invoice instead of 3 or 4 is a wonderful example of a problem an entrepreneur can solve, and it doesn't have anything to do with product features or technology.  Reading this is like having a glass of cold water thrown in your face (well, for <i>some</i> of us!)<p><i>We also identified underserved market segments (companies with multi-brand support requirements) and segments which were getting priced out because the current solutions were expensive.
So we reprioritized  our feature set to what we thought is the ideal product/market fit for us. This means that things like Twitter and Facebook integration can wait. But things like multiple support emails or support for SLAs and Business hours are in.</i><p>Very inspiring.  Thanks for sharing such details about your experience.  I think a lot of people can learn something useful from your experience.  You've certainly given me some thoughts to chew on.",1300463508

For example 12590 is drawn accurately (as I recall, haven't lived there in a decade), but when I enter 12603 I get the same map for 12590, when 12603 should be farther north as it's poughkeepsie.  I tried this in two separate browsers so it wasn't a caching thing unless you're caching by client IP.<p>Another example: 11202 shouldn't have a map at all, it's reserved for the central PO in Brooklyn (Cadman Plaza GPO), instead it's being drawn as a region in North Brooklyn.<p>Another example from outside Brooklyn: 60515 (Downers Grove, IL) looks accurate, but 60516 (southern Downers Grove) appears to be drawn using the 60517 (Woodridge, IL) boundaries, and when I punch in 60517 it gets drawn using the boundaries for 60561 (Darien, IL).<p>I haven't played with GIS data for several years but remember than there was a set of ZIP code data sets around 2005 which had accurate latitude/longitude points but the ZIP codes were frequently off by one (I ended up having to manually massage the data because I couldn't find a pattern to the way the ZIP code was appearing in the data).",1300463504

2340777,comment,2337745,2340608,0,0,KirinDave,,,"> The only reason anyone even paid attention to this article at all is because 98% of what everyone hears, all the time, is pro-big startup, pro-VC, pro-liquidity event, pro- this and pro- that.<p>Perhaps because you're so far out in the (physical) hinterlands of software, you hear a time-delayed different message. Living close to the epicenter of the startup world, I hear very few people really talk about flip-based startups anymore, and the general consensus is to be wary of VC and take it as late as you need it. Indeed, if I had to describe a ""pro-"" that has infected Valley culture right now, I would call it the ""pro-lean startup"" fetishism. It gets a little tedious, but it's a far more reasonable sentiment than the pro-flip culture that dominated the Valley back a few years ago.<p>Really, the difference between the idea put forth in this essay and a game-changing techcrunch-courting startup is scope. I could work on a small lifestyle product (and I have a few in mind that might be fun), but they're not... game changers. I'd like to work on a product that really makes a difference to a large number of customers. Very few independent products have the resources or scope to achieve this.<p>Coming out of college, people think they have to work either for a big company or a big idea. The truth put forth in this article is that you need not do either, And That Is Okay. Indeed, there is a great deal of freedom that comes with it.<p>> Look, dominant paradigm: You need to chillax.<p>""Dominant,"" you say? Hardly. ""Glorified,"" perhaps. The vast majority of people do what you do; sell small-scale contracts and services to small-scale partners and customers. And that's fine and good and noble and grist for the mill of global economics.

2340767,comment,2340286,2340286,0,0,hemancuso,,,"I've never understood how people can use EBS in production. The durability numbers they quote are bad and they wave their hands around about increased durability with snapshots, but never quantify what that means.<p>Hard drives are unreliable and they certainly don't fail independently of one another - but the independence of their failure is much more independent than EBS.<p>With physical dives and n-parity RAID you drastically reduce the rate of data loss. This is because although failures are often correlated, it's quite unlikely to have permenant failure of 3 drives out of a pool of 7 within 24 hours. It happens, but it is very rare.<p>With EBS, your 7 volumes might very well be on the same underlying RAID array. So you have no greater durability by building software RAID on top of that. If anything, it potentially decreases durability.<p>You could utilize snapshots to S3, but is that really a good solution? It seems that deploying onto EBS at any meaningful scale is a recipe for garunteed data-loss. Raid on physical disks isn't a great solution either, and there is no substitute for backups - but at least you can build a 9 disk RaidZ3 array that will experience pool failure so rarely that you can more safely worry about things like memory and data bus corruption.",1300463061

Even better, if you finished the job in <i>less</i> time than you estimated, they'd complain and tell you that you missed low and needed to do a more precise job of estimation next time.<p>I suggested to my boss once that if they insisted on having all this documentation written (seriously, we were supposed to write up docs on what the function names were going to be, what the arguments were, and what they'd do -- <i>before</i> we were allowed to write any code) then we should probably build some time into the schedule to make sure we could update them based on what we'd learned during the actual process of writing the code. He told me ""I understand what you're saying, but that's not possible. We need all of the documentation done up front so that if we're behind schedule, we can add more people to the project and they can read that documentation to get up to speed quickly.""<p>I looked at him for a few seconds, stunned speechless, then basically said ""In my experience, that never works.""

Canonical example: a typical web page resource is a collection of links to other pages, links to css files, links to js files, links to images, etc.<p>Each item in the list is going to have a URI for the item, probably some text that briefly describes the item, and if necessary it can have a value that identifies the type of item.<p>If I'm understanding correctly, your playlist resource is an ordered list of song identifiers, the song identifiers can appear more than once, and when you ""delete a song"" you're removing a single one of those identifiers. That sounds to me like an update of the playlist resource. The simplest model would be:<p>GET /playlist/{playlist id}
... client modifies representation ...
PUT /playlist/{playlist id}<p>That's not atomic and it puts some application-logic burden on the client, but you _are_ writing an API to allow others to develop full-featured clients, and maybe the burden also provides flexibility for operations you haven't thought of.<p>Another approach would be for the representation of the playlist to include a unique id for each item in the list: your song id + index. You're not using a DELETE method here though, because you're not deleting a resource. You would use POST to update the playlist resource:<p>POST /playlist/{playlist id}
operation=removeitem&songid={song id}&index={index}<p>This is the general RESTful pattern for doing a partial update of a resource, so the client doesn't have to GET and PUT the complete resource.",1300462513

They might also be a bad example, because I remember that one of them had a successful sale...it's true for a lot of other ideas, so work with the example.)

Add three more. You're not waiting for a shipment of servers to the datacenter to handle a sudden load from a positive mention on HN.<p>Saying that the cloud is a fad and we should all own our gear does two things: (a) increases humanity's carbon footprint, since most organizations never utilize hardware to their full potential, and (b) guarantees that only those with significant capital to buy a fleet, a cage, and power will ever compete in the Internet space, which is where we were many years ago.

The entire web development is being outsourced and should be ready by April 1st. It's my first ""online venture"", but it's not innovative. I'm just replicating a successful business model and using it to do a few things:
1) Generate income independently
2) Learn more about outsourcing projects
3) Get my 'foot in the door' in the online business world
4) Use this to gain some recognition amongst like-minded peers so I can expand my network.<p>I just had a new housemate move in and as luck would have it, he's a Java Developer with a masters in comp sci.

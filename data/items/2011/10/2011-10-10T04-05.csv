No external memory bus to tap into. So you'd need the sort of equipment used to remove layers from dies to expose the cells for reverse engineering, testing, etc. If someone with these resources is after you, you're already fucked regardless of the exact technological vector.<p>Secondly, a system designer could trivially add some amount of volatile storage for holding security sensitive data. Various schemes of encrypted pages that are decrypted using a key stored in volatile SRM within the CMS could be used. In other words, we could do the same things we currently do with hard drives between the memrister array and SRAM that acts as a decrypted cache.<p>Thirdly, you're applying an expectation to all memristers that is not applied to existing storage technologies. It might be a fair criticism of a concrete product that operates in an insecure way, but it's absurd to apply this expectation to an entire technology.",1318221085

Few in the mainstream media care about your technical achievements.<p>As for the Kathy Griffin thing, eh, so he's seeing someone famous.  Who cares?

3092252,comment,3089352,3091705,3,0,wvoq,,,"> You make it sound like Anwar al-Awlaki had a beer with al Qaeda so we decided to whack him.<p>Well, that's practically all that we know-- he was killed for propagandizing on behalf of some terrible ideas.  But it isn't illegal to propagandize on behalf of terrible ideas, whereas it is illegal to execute US citizens because you find them loathsome and geo-strategically inconvenient.<p>Wouldn't it be nice if we could learn publicly what Anwar al-Awlaki actually did, and whether his actions were criminal?  As far as I can tell, it's unclear whether anything al-Awlaki did would actually satisfy the ""imminent lawless action"" test in a civilian criminal court.  I suspect the senior officials responsible for his assassination understand this too, which is why they would prefer to dispense with the niceties of extradition and trial.<p>So here's where we find ourselves: in a world in which the US government openly assassinates US citizens who have not been convicted of any crime, and no one bats an eyelash.",1318219652

In particular, that Puppet has much better documentation (especially for doing the initial setup) and a more sysadmin-friendly language, but that Chef makes it easier to carry out complex tasks.<p>Despite some cool things I've been able to do in Chef, Puppet is probably going to end up the winner, if for no other reason than it having much much better support for RHEL and clones (ie Scientific Linux).  Chef was extremely unimpressive there in many ways, and anything related to deployment where the wiki includes the line ""RPM installation via ELFF has been deprecated"" is going to be a non-starter in the HPC world. (Or doesn't, anymore... any mention of RPM seems to have been scrubbed now.)<p>We're probably only going to use it on infrastructure/head nodes though: our compute nodes are provisioned on ramdisk statelessly using Warewulf, and are easier to reconfigure with a reboot/redeploy than via CM.<p>(edit to clarify)",1318219272

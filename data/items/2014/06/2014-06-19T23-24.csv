7918929,comment,7917361,7917361,3,0,gedrap,,,"Some people hate the idea of shifting everything to Web. Other people hate how unsuitable HTML5/CSS3 is for replicating native appearance.<p>But I think overall, it&#x27;s a good middle ground. There will never be a perfect solution in the real world (where resources are limited, and companies are motivated to lock-in).<p>Web is not a perfect medium, it has it&#x27;s disadvantages. Web apps were definitely not in mind when developing and designing Web. But on other hand, it works and it&#x27;s proven, it&#x27;s been here for a while. There are solid technologies supporting it (nginx, apache, programming languages with their frameworks). Some say why not native? For the reasons we shifted away from native. Could we improve current situation with native applications? Maybe. But it requires a major player to get involved (read: money and skill). Would they be motivated in pursuing something philosophically right and all, while current technologies generate a lot of money? Doubt so.<p>Yes, HTML and CSS were not meant to be used for mobile apps, mimicking native appearance. As an alternative, we can stick to vendor, and learn vendor specific stuff which doesn&#x27;t share much in common, not even programming languages. Meanwhile HTML/CSS is something much more developers are familiar. It allows more developers to develop iOS/Android apps. Maybe we should just make it DRYier like we were doing with so many problems? At first, grid frameworks came for CSS layout, then Bootstrap. And in future bootstrap-which-gives-native-iOS/Android look will come? There must be something like that already. We could throw it all away and create some new API (some suggest JS + WebGL). But again. It requires major effort, major resources and current technologies are money machines. So why to stop?<p>Not everything can be perfect and correct in real world, with real constraints. Some people prove that wrong from time to time. Will someone do this time?",1403222212

7918914,comment,7917475,7918800,2,0,bconklin42,,,"There isn&#x27;t a whole lot of need for buffering since we&#x27;ve got all the tweaks in place that make our system as fast as it is, but we do have a couple of levels of buffering incase of network issues, downtime before a replica set member takes over as primary, etc. so that we can try to avoid any isolated failure from slowing down the processing that comes before that point in the work flow.<p>Working from the end backwards, the first (or last) buffer is a Go buffered channel running within the process on the router which feeds into the database. These channels work as a sort of queue between concurrent Go-routines, or &quot;workers&quot;, which have a set amount of allocated space in memory. These are empty most of the time, but if there is a failure with pushing to the database they can start to fill up in order to not block the process before it in the workflow until the system recovers. Before those Go workers on each of the &quot;Router&quot; servers that push to the database is a Redis queue which basically serves as a holding pin in between the CDN servers and the database cluster, which is the data&#x27;s first stop after leaving it&#x27;s originating servers.<p>On those originating servers is the Go process which reads the logs and pushes the data to Redis on the routers, these also utilize buffered channels. So all these layers of buffers work to prevent a block in the workflow during momentary downtimes while the system recovers. However, each of these layers of buffering do have a limit and if they fill up will begin to block on the process before them. In the event of a major failure (such as all members of a replica set being down or the network between the CDN server and the Router being down) the Go process running on the CDN server will stop reading the logs at a position where it lands when it is unable to feed more logs into the channel and hold that position until the channel starts to be drained from the other side and space in the channel becomes available.",1403221899

This should be the thing that the CEO is most engaged with, especially if the CEO is doing his job as &quot;culture minister.&quot; Now this doesn&#x27;t mean that a CEO is the only person who talks to a new hire, but it does mean that the CEO should be the lead face that interacts with the possible hire from first contact.<p>This also doesn&#x27;t mean that the CEO is only doing recruiting. Ideally the recruiting team would offer to the CEO a top ten list of candidates for a position and then the CEO makes the decision to contact and woo the possible hire until he/she is confident that this person is a good fit and has the skills necessary.<p>Nothing is more important than the people in your company, so treat them that way and you don&#x27;t have to fuck around with A/B testing emails.",1403221868

Video files, even files compressed with modern codecs, are really big, and the concepts are generally really hard for most people to grok. The knowledge is so arcane that if you have a basic grasp of ffmpeg you are already a wizard. Most people&#x27;s eyes will glaze over the second you start talking about how they should use a different container, or codec, or whatever. That&#x27;s why GIFs (for sub-one-minute videos) and Flash (for long videos and/or videos with sound) became the universal language of video; there was no more &quot;Here&#x27;s this video, but you have to install WMP/RealPlayer/QuickTime/Bonzai Buddy to see it!&quot; In fact, Flash probably became the standard because it did such a good job at integrating with the rest of the browser and didn&#x27;t shove obtrusive branding in the user&#x27;s face.<p>The tl;dr is that the support needs to very near universal for this to work, and no one is interested in WebM. Google probably could&#x27;ve forced the issue with YouTube, and they initially claimed they were going to, but they chickened out for some reason. I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s because VP8 didn&#x27;t live up to expectations and that they&#x27;ll renew the push when VP9 is done, but whatever the motive, the reality is that if you want HTML 5 video to work, you must use H.264, as even Mozilla has been forced to admit.",1403221077

For example, SSD explicitly exposes to OS, where new blocks are written and which blocks they are overwriting. This would allow FS to cheaply track multiple versions of files. When a portion of a file is overwritten with some new change, this version is discarded and SSD is instructed that rest of blocks that were storing changes for that version of the file are expendable as well.

The problem is that such patterns of language can and do easily harden into norms -- i.e., you may only use masculine nouns for probabilistic reasons, but this pattern of speaking, if sufficiently widespread, can give rise to the view it is abnormal (in the normative, not the merely descriptive sense) for women to hack or start hacker blogs.

At the moment, WebGL support on mobile tends to be incomplete and suffers from poor performance on most devices anyways.<p>Mobile will always lag behind desktop in terms of browser performance and features, but browser optimization and mobile hardware is improving every day. Keep in mind that both desktop and mobile browsers already utilize GPU acceleration in some aspects of rendering normal content.",1403219055

I only notice it at night, lying in bed when it is quiet. To me, it sounds like an idling car sitting within a few hundred feet of my house. At first, I suspected cops were sitting near my house (on a corner, near a stop sign) waiting for people to run the stop sign, but I never found any idling cars when I went to investigate. Fortunately I&#x27;m not bothered by it.",1403219017

7918753,comment,7918691,7918691,1,0,blystad,,,"Hello,<p>As part of a school project in Software Engineering, I had to help my team understand and use Git.<p>Making them commit their work is fairly simple, that they can do with little guidance. The problems occour when they have merge conflicts.<p>We all worked in the same branch (stupid, I know, I didn&#x27;t know better then) which created a lot of merge conflicts. The team had some issues fixing that in the beginning, but tools like SmartGit / SourceTree made their experience better.<p>Based on my limited experiences, I would recommend the following:<p>1 - Start with the simple parts, checking out code and committing.<p>2 - Then, introduce the concept of feature branches. Do not go all the way that Git flow does in the beginning, keep it simple for now, and then, when more of the organisation understands Git, you can go over to the full Git flow model. Ensure that people focus their branches, and let them only live for a short amount of time. This so that work can be synced up regularily.<p>3 - What can go wrong? Show them a somewhat advanced merge conflict and how you solved it.<p>4 - Try to introduce it to them using a GUI client (SourceTree / SmartGit) if they&#x27;re not into the Command line. It can make adoption easier and less painful.<p>Good luck!",1403218917

366389,comment,366114,366114,0,0,DomesticMouse,,,"As a ten year veteran of Java, currently learning C# (the world is full of irony), I can say that Java is a simpler language. There are a bunch of bones thrown to c++ and assembler focused guys in C# making it a more complex language to master. And I dispute that VisualStudio is a better IDE than IntelliJ. So, my honest opinion is start with Java.<p>Spend time writing code, and just as importantly, reading it. Read through Spring, Hibernate, et al. Understand the architectures, the trade offs, and the code tricks.",1226876244

A friend of mine wanted to join Doctors without Borders (a non-profit that goes places where people most urgently need help), but was strongly discouraged to do so by her colleagues. The reason? All of them suggested she would fall behind far too much in the 3 years or so that she wanted to be gone for.<p>Yes, anecdotes!=data, and surely web programming has also moved on enormously in the last three years, but I would not underestimate (misunderestimate? ;)) the continued education a good doctor has to complete.",1226876242

You can copy the Aphex Twin's sound, but he's already done it. Even if he depends on a brand of synth to sound like that, that means you can't use the same synth without sounding the same. It's a no-win situation.<p>I think the term is first-time advantage.",1226876109

Is there any way to do this?<p>You've got to give the secret out in some fashion or another - otherwise the application won't be able to decrypt the picture or whatever is it.. Even if you obfuscate it, it'll still be somewhere (in memory or whatever).<p>Maybe this requires a rethink of your security model? What are you trying to secure?",1226875964

366370,comment,366114,366341,0,0,icey,,,"I don't think the time-line has as much to do with it as the scope of the changes do. Again, this is personal opinion; and I'm speaking from the angle of someone who has spent many years doing consulting work on the Microsoft stack, and having to deal with figuring out which ways the 9-to-5'ers are going to break things next.<p>Version 1.0 of the C# specification clocks in at 405 pages. There was an addendum in 1.2 that I'll leave out, because it was a respecification of 1.0.<p>2.0 came along and added 117 pages of specification - including generics, partial classes, iterators, and a handful of other things. On pure specification, that's a growth of 25% to the core language. (I know this isn't really scientific, but I think you get my drift).<p>Then in 3.0, just 2 years later, the spec is back to over 500 pages (just for the language!). This version added a bunch of functional paradigm stuff to the language, lambdas, linq and the like.<p>And now in 4.0, they're talking about making C# essentially a dynamic language.<p>Now, all this being said, I really do like C#; but I think that it behooves everyone who likes C# to admit that it's a large and evolving language; the paradigms that Microsoft keeps adding to the language don't really seem to fit from one version to the next.",1226874692

There are lot's of people who say that you are subject to Microsoft's directing of the language, but if you go with Java, you are subject to Sun/OS direction just the same.

Not just in ads, the programs themselves are propaganda for a certain way of being and acting in the world. True, the bbc is using it's hold on your people's monkey brain to program people with a slightly elitist, more educated (to the extent an 11th grade reading level is better then the 5th grade one in the US), hiply cynical reality.<p>People don't understand how much or deeply their reality is created by the reality created for them that they watch for hours at a time. I don't care if your reality is programmed by whorish ads in the US or high quality satire in the UK. The point is that entering a vulnerable semihypnotic neurological state and giving control of your brain to some other people is what does the damage. It's not just the content of the electronic magic that causes you to enter that vulnerable state. It's a feature of the medium. Britan is less malevolent then the US to it's TV viewers, because what it does to it's hypnotized masses is healthier for them.

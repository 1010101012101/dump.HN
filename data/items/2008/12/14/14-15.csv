This is just a rhetorical flourish on the part of the writer. There are no such ""ambitions"" visible on the ground.<p>Of  course the writer has conveniently made the subject of statement ""the city"", and has given no supporting evidence.<p>There are many MNC research labs, but nothing like what the article implies. And very often these Indian research labs don't produce high quality research. Just ask someone in Microsoft or Yahoo Research how good the Indian ""labs"" are.<p>Intel seems to have a more succesful offshore lab, but it is the exception, not the rule.<p>It looks like the journalist took a couple of weeks tour of the city, swallowed whatever Nandan Nilekani and other corporate CEO types  told him (Infosys Labs is a joke within Infosys. ""Innovations"" often have to do with ""process improvement"" and so on, hardly cutting edge CS research) and wrote a sloppy article, thin on logic and facts.",1229266219

Also the jury didn't really care (Robert Scoble did play solitaire while evaluating the contestants). Two of the 3 finalists were companies that exisited 2 to 5 years. The criteria of choosing them were that they were profitable. They were more like a success story than a startup!\nLeweb didn't even release a one liner describing each startup. I wouldn't be too surprised if the startup videos will never be released.",1229265394

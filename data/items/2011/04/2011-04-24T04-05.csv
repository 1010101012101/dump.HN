let say x = m XOR d. Then x must has at least one 1 bit (or else m == d). Call the bit p. So now we can separate A into two list A0 are those with bit p == 0 and A1 are those with bit p == 1. So we have separated m and d into two different list.<p>Step 2: Iterate through I, maintain two number x0 and x1 as the results of XOR operations of those elements with p bit == 0 and == 1 respectively. Do the same for A to get a0 and a1. Then we know that m is either a0 XOR x0 or a1 XOR x1. One more linear test in A to confirm the missing element m.<p>In the end, the running time can be squeezed into 2 N.

2478304,comment,2477877,2478151,1,0,byoung2,,,"<i>If most startups implement this solution wouldn't the problem just replicate itself to regions instead of availability zones?</i><p>I think the problem would be less severe across regions than across availability zones within a region and here's why.  A major benefit of multiple availability zones is the low-latency connection between them.  That encourages you to copy instances, EBS volumes, S3 buckets, and RDS data between them, most of the time en masse in the event of a failure.  Across regions, you're sending data over a slower connection, so you have to take care of replication on an ongoing basis.  So your instances, EBS volumes, S3 backups and RDS instances and replicas would already be in the secondary region when failure occurs in the primary.  I'd compare it to having a vacation home and spare car in another state when an earthquake hits, instead of looking for a shelter near the disaster area.",1303620765

2478287,comment,2465002,2477876,4,0,jasonlotito,,,"I disagree.  First, disconnect the actual score with something that indicates a high quality comment.  You can display something as high quality without showing a score.<p>Next, a high quality comment need not have comments.  Some of the best comments do not need followup.  We should also discourage comments that merely parrot the parent and offer no content of their own.  This is probably the biggest argument I have against not having any soft of indicator.  If a comment is good, it deserves an up vote to indicate quality.<p>Next, replies still do not solve the scanning problem.  For me to deduce the quality comments using replies requires I read through all the comments.  Sometimes this is not an issue, but posts with a larger number of comments, this becomes problematic.<p>Finally, the above also means that replies of comments, and replies of replies, suddenly makes it really difficult what others deem quality content.<p>At the end of the day, up voting comments is meant to distinguish good, high quality comments from the normal run of the mill comments.  If it's not being used for that, then up votes are merely being used as a way to obtain karma.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that by removing karma from showing which posts are of higher quality, it serves no real purpose other than to obtain more karma.  I'm more interested in reading quality comments than obtaining karma, something the current system doesn't assist with.  It only makes karma something to ""brag"" about.",1303619774

If I understood you, you advocate using a low level language, mainly because that makes it hard to ""get fancy."" But by doing so, you are forcing complexity to go up significantly in a different way. For example, how much harder would it be to code a make tool like Rake in C than in Ruby?

If somebody wanted to give Dr. Stallman a Nobel Prize for contributions to humanity, I wouldn't bat an eye.<p>But to ""the outside world"" a lot of these things are hidden behind a personality that is incredibly off-putting, and that's a little bit tragic.  I wish Stallman was a tiny bit more ""normal"" just because I want more people exposed to the things that he has done.",1303617943

The big, conspicuous, open-to-everyone up and down vote arrows feed into an agree/disagree poll whose total (agree votes minus disagree votes) is displayed by the comment.<p>Meanwhile, the useful/useless votes are smaller or perhaps harder to access, like the current ""flag"" system for comments where you have to click through to the comment's own page first.  Perhaps voting <i>either</i> agree or disagree automatically registers your vote for useful, and to vote useless you have to click through like with ""flag"".",1303617827

Then d + m can be in [a + 2^(k+1),a + 2^(k+2),...,a + 2^63].<p>We will have less than 63 cases. In each case, after we find d and m, make sure they are in range and then linear test.<p>So in the end, we may need to run at most 63+3 = 66 N. But it still linear though.",1303617770

Will players actually notice or care about this? In a 2D games, it probably makes a lot more economical sense to add some kind of procedural effect to show this, such as tinting them red, making them flash, or showing a bright red outline.",1303617710

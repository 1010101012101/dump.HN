I mean, if you wanted to argue about it, you could say that the problems with Zimbabwe are politics, and certainly aren't new: they've been covering that country's decline for years in The Economist, and if I recall, had one of their reporters kicked out of the country.",1219039030

278999,comment,278704,278948,0,0,olefoo,,,"The two reasons javascript is not widespread on the server are:<p>1. limited database access libraries, there are no standard libraries for talking to mysql/postgres/oracle/sybase/mssql<p>2. lack of namespace support in the language itself, which means that you can't rely on external code to not step on your variables.<p>Also there's a minor usability issue with using the same code in two different environments; the server side and the client-side are not the same and confusing the two can introduce whole new classes of bugs and security holes. Not that anyone here would ever lose track of where the file they were working on was supposed be run.",1219038841

Many people believe that ""what is the probability of X?"" really means something like ""if we were to re-create these exact conditions many times, what proportion of those iterations will X be true?""<p>This problem seems to be a good thought experiment demonstrating that those two questions are not equivalent.

SOAP sucks and it's largely due to MS' influence, but Winer merely came up with XML-RPC, which is pretty close to Damien's idea that maybe POST is enough.<p>Not that I'm a Winer fan -- his behavior oddly reflects his surname -- but facts is facts.

278979,comment,278704,278969,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Because it has already become a common tongue, and with rich web apps becoming the norm, it'll only increase..  It's the language pretty much everyone building web apps knows.  I work predominantly in Perl (and in the past in Python), and I've tinkered with other languages.  But, throughout all of that, at least for the past five years, JavaScript has been part of the job.<p>Imagine the meeting wherein a handful of developers are tasked with choosing a language and platform for a new app.  Say, four people...one likes Ruby, one likes Python, one likes PHP, and the last likes Perl (and they all agree that Java and C# are too damned verbose).  Which language wins?  Well, they <i>all</i> know JavaScript, because every web developer knows JavaScript, and they think jQuery is pretty swish...assume there's a high quality server-side environment, of course.<p>Obviously, it's not a foregone conclusion that JavaScript will move into a position of strength on the server.  It requires too many pieces to fall into place (good implementation, good libraries, good integration with web servers, etc.) for anyone to call it a done deal.  But I think it'd be foolish to bet strongly <i>against</i> it happening.",1219037200

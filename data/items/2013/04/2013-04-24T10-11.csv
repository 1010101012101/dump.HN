5600734,comment,5600538,5600538,51,0,michaelochurch,,,"Here's my stance on the problem. Most people here have heard of the MacLeod hierarchy (Losers, Clueless, Sociopaths). The VC-istan cult is about Cluelessness. (The MacLeod Sociopaths are the investors and executive implants who live outside companies and, smartly, get to diversify.) The whole ecosystem is built up around extracting value from young, white men who have a high proclivity toward Cluelessness.<p>When you're in school, deadlines are well-tested because everyone's doing approximately the same work. Unless you have a health crisis or death in the family, you don't have an excuse for a late assignment and the typical 10%/day policy is more than generous. When you're at work, though, 90% of ""deadlines"" are just someone's opinion and a good 50% are impossible. VC-istan is about exploiting young kids who haven't learned that yet and who would rather stay at work till 3:45 am than miss a ""deadline"" set by some VP with Shit's Easy Syndrome. See: <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2009/04/have-you-ever-legalized-marijuana.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2009/04/have-you-ever-legali...</a><p>The older programmers <i>are</i> really good at what they do, and they're a lot more flexible than the stereotype gives them credit for. The problem, however, is that they're a threat to the cult. Bring someone on board who does his best work between 8 and 11 (when the kids are just starting to roll in) and goes home at 5:30, ignores the deadlines that don't actually matter (i.e. the ones set by egotistical bosses, not hard deadlines that must be met if at all possible) and suddenly there's a breakdown of the Cluelessness. Couple this also with the Dunning-Kruger effect in reverse; the Clueless young people don't see that the older guy is 4x more efficient than they are (because they're inefficient and don't know it, cf. D-K). All they see is a guy putting in significantly fewer hours. Either the young Clueless will see him as a piker for his shorter work hours, or as a badass for his high effectiveness (making him a legitimacy threat, as the younger engineers see him as the real alpha).<p>I would also add that there's a culture of extremely harsh age-grading. VC-istan is most concentrated in high-COL areas where you can't raise a family on a (non-financial) programmer's salary; at two you can do it, but two career jobs, plus kids, necessitates maids and daycare and that's expensive and complicated, too. Because the only way to own a house in these cities is to become an executive or financier, you have a lot of 22-year-olds who see themselves being executives-who-code in 5 (!) years-- having managerial control of the division of labor and using it to give themselves the fun stuff, but being full-time programmers-- never mind the fact that that's extremely impractical in almost every organization. Very rarely do executives spend less than 20 hours per week in meetings. A 40-year-old who's been around the block and still programs might tell them as much. That's a problem. To counteract this, the 35-year-old VCs and 30-year-old founders discredit the 40-year-old programmers as ""bitter"" and he reacts by leaving, just after the one-year cliff so as to take a couple lottery tickets out the door with him because, well, strange things happen.<p>The short way to say this is that older programmers aren't the problem. The issue is that most of these formulaic startups are founded on exploiting young talent that overestimates the career value of low-end engineering work (because these people don't have the experience to tell what quality work is) and most older people can see through the bullshit. That's dangerous, insofar as it represents the threat of the <i>younger</i> Clueless engineers also learning to see.",1366799658

It borders on blaming the press for lack of market fit.<p>I'm not saying the world doesn't need a social network for families or a social network for pets or whatever.  I'm just saying I wouldn't use one, and the people I know wouldn't use one, but I'm sure you've done your research and there very well may be people that will.  I sincerely wish you best of luck with it.  But if I were you I'd be listening to negative feedback just as much as to positive feedback.<p>Frankly I'm just trying to help.  I think EveryMe is a really nicely done app, and I love the fact that you had the balls to do a big launch and get everyone hyped up about the product.  Launches are supposed to be big bets with high risk and potentially high reward.  I wouldn't want that to disappear.  Just because a product didn't resonate with consumers as much as you hoped it would, it doesn't mean the idea of a big launch is bad.  I wouldn't want Apple to just release products without ""launching"" them.  Facebook is a counter example, but I think they would have succeeded if they had a big launch as well, their product just didn't need it.<p>Personally I prefer the idea of EveryMe over Origami, so a bit sad to see you change direction because the launch didn't go as planned.  I think there are a lot of iterative things you could still try with EveryMe (eg automatic location based groups).  Will be interesting to see what you can do in Origami that you can't already do in EveryMe.",1366799508

My point is that the articles headline is overly dramatic: Mailbox.app is not a complete security failure because of one hack that requires physical access. Given that Mailbox only supports GMail, Id be more worried to put my email in Googles hands than worrying over someone grabbing my phone out of mine.<p><i>Mailbox is BIG. We are not talking of an average app here!</i><p>Mailbox.app is a free app that has been downloaded a couple of million times, I wouldnt call it BIG yet. Its very new, its still on version 1, so its not expected to be perfect.",1366797913

Unlike the Series 60/Symbian series, these Nokia phones are snappy and do not slow down with time.<p>These feature phones were quite capable for basic phone features, but never evolved to the Facebook era. This effectively led to the mass adoption of touch screen based phone. If Nokia has solved the social app problem with this phone, I think they have a winner.",1366797890

Once you hit 2nd grade, teachers were going to start tearing up your homework unless it was written in cursive.<p>The next year, it was ""3rd grade"" when teachers would start tearing up non-cursive papers, then 4th, 5th, 6th and ""definitely in junior high"".  But it never happened in reality.<p>In my 20s, the Big Scary Thing In The Future was ageism in tech.  Once you hit 30, you'd never find work again in this industry.<p>Then it was 35.  Then 40.<p>I've given up listening.  Every year, in addition to getting better at what I do, I find that more people want to pay me more money to come program computers for them.<p>Now it's certainly possible that the <i>real</i> number is 45, and you'll find me living in a cardboard box and begging for nickels at the off-ramp in a few years.  But at this point I'm not overly worried about this particular myth.",1366797785

You should really check it out if you have large amounts of images to be organized and want to bulk-optimize them. It takes some dedication to get used to the workflow and the available set of tools (many!), but it's worth it. Also, Adobe dropped the price significantly some time ago, making this great product available for a bigger audience.",1366797657

However, I don't see the harm in 'launching' down the line (6 months/year) or re-launching when you've got product/market fit.<p>For example, the people that made pebble had made other smart watches before, Facebook was used for 2+ years in collages before it was 'launched' to everyone. Mozilla spent 6 years developing it's plaform before it launched Firefox (which was 99% the same code as Mozilla anyway).<p>I'm not saying have a closed/private-beta - just don't go out of your way to call the press, until you have product/market fit.",1366797628

It's entirely conceivable that by then the increased solar output and our own tech advances will have made it possible to take up residence in other places in the solar system, which may even have become slightly more habitable by then due to the increased solar radiation.

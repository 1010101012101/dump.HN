I suspect most people don&#x27;t understand how subtly <i>addictive</i> TV can be, as it takes at lest that month to break the habit. While I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s part of the same effect, there seems to be something similar for advertising: you don&#x27;t realize the huge cognitive load it puts on you until you&#x27;ve been away from it for a significant amount of time.

Up to this point, these technologists have been only moderately successful in permeating the market.<p>Ads are so terrible, and ad blockers so effective, that it&#x27;s a risk for media companies to even talk about ads and ad blockers. It&#x27;s bad PR for media companies, and an argument against ad-blockers is more likely to simply make more unaware people aware of ad-blockers than it is to persuade ad-blocker users to stop blocking ads. Ad blockers are a problem for media companies, but not a big enough problem to warrant taking the risk of talking about ads.<p>All that changed when Apple decided to include ad blocking in IOS9. Now ad-blocking will permeate a very large portion of the market, and since Apple is a trendsetter in the mobile market, it&#x27;s likely that other mobile manufacturers will follow suit. Obviously Google is not going to support ad-blocking in Android, but they&#x27;ll have a hard time preventing Samsung/Motorola/etc. from shipping with their own ad-blocking software.<p>Now it&#x27;s worth the risk for media companies to talk about ads and ad blockers, because if they don&#x27;t, their entire business model is going to die anyway. So they&#x27;re trying to persuade consumers that ads are actually in their best interest so that there will be consumer pressure on Android phone manufacturers to allow ads.<p>I don&#x27;t think it will work. Consumer pressure only happens when consumers feel pain, and there&#x27;s no ad-supported media so great that losing it is more painful than ads. The only people who are actually feeling pain from this are people whose businesses are ad-supported, and frankly, I&#x27;m quite happy about that: people who tie their business to an immoral, unethical business model <i>should</i> be punished. It&#x27;s rare that the bad guys actually get what&#x27;s coming to them.<p>Anyone who is worried that this is going to hurt technologists: it&#x27;s only going to hurt the ones who deserve it.

It&#x27;s <i>one</i> valid utility function (even in accordance to VNM theorem), which is why I don&#x27;t understand the saying &quot;there is no utility function&quot;.<p>If you read what I wrote in response to gress below, I of course have no hope that utility theory would unveil a good utility function in itself; indeed you cannot do it within mathematics exclusively.

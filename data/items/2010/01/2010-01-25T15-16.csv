But how can I make it as secure as possible to collect votes or other feedback in an online venue?  Who is researching this?  Are there already techniques in use that I don't know about?<p>Banks do a pretty good job, but that's partly because they do thorough physical-world validation of identity before going on to online venues.  Is there any way for me to set up an online polling system and still be, say, 99% certain that people aren't gaming it?",1264435184

It's also why different investors can come up with a wide range of valuations when they get down to considering an investment. In my personal experience, few financiers place significant reliance on projected financials - it's the underlying assumptions / notes that matter.<p>Just because it's difficult to forecast a year out also doesn't mean that it shouldn't or can't be done especially since investors themselves have to assume that they won't be able to exit within a year.  Coming up with better projections for ROI just adds more datapoints from the very people/entrepreneurs who should know their space/market best (especially in more stable industries - I note that Wilson emphasizes that this is how he thinks of non-tech businesses).",1264435034

1075303,comment,1073205,1073660,0,0,fexl,,,"That is precisely why I criticize SSL.  One of the primary goals of SSL is to <i>authenticate</i> a site so that Grandma can rest assured she is not being scammed.  ""Phishing"" represents a catastrophically expensive failure to achieve that goal.<p>Trusted root CAs have ""verified"" millions of SSL certificates to one degree or another, from simple checks for domain control all the way up to brick and mortar audits.  The problem is, any one of those millions of certificates can be used to phish customers of building-and-loan.com and steal massive amounts of their money.<p>A scammer simply sends Grandma an official looking email saying ""We have recently received a request to wire money out of your Building and Loan account.  Please log in <i>here</i> to confirm or deny this request.  This extra level of precaution is for your safety.  Sincerely, [insert signature of CEO here].""<p>Now when Grandma clicks the link, she is taken to an SSL-protected site called ""building-and-loan-confirmation.com"", which to Grandma's delight and comfort is ""verified by Equifax"".  This misplaced trust costs Grandma $25,700.<p>I am thinking the <i>very least</i> browser writers can do is give Grandma a simple way to ""confirm"" a site which she has visited.  Once she has confirmed it, and maybe given it a ""pet name"", her browser will display an especially reassuring theme any time she visits that site again (e.g. green border, friendly picture, familiar name, whatever).<p>Grandma still needs to know that she should <i>only</i> log in when she sees that reassuring theme.  Any time she visits a non-confirmed site, she will only see a plain looking neutral theme.  (Note:  NOT alarming red, because then she'd be see red constantly as she browses around.  Just neutral.)<p>Note that the suggestion I just made actually has <i>nothing</i> to do with SSL.  Keep in mind that a phisher could easily send Grandma an <i>unsecured</i> link in an email -- no HTTPs at all.  If Grandma clicks that link, she will only see a neutral theme, and if she remembers her lesson, she will NOT log in because she does not see the reassuring theme.<p>Of course, you could also say that Grandma should remember this lesson:  don't click links in emails.  Only visit sites by (1) typing in the name yourself or (2) using a bookmark.  But I'm just trying to suggest a way to help Grandma <i>after</i> she has forgotten that primary lesson.<p>Here's another idea.  You know how Firefox remembers passphrases for you, protected by a master security passphrase.  That could help here.  If Grandma visits the real building-and-loan.com site, her user name and password will be filled out for her automatically.  If she visits a phishing site, it won't.  That is another ""hook"" where browser writers might do something to help dear Grandma protect her property from predators.  Something along the lines of:  ""This site is asking you to log in, but you have never logged into this site before.  Are you <i>sure</i> you want to do this?""",1264434800

It really has very little to do with C or Lisp specifically.<p>The more different the language you are learning is from ones you have used in the past, the more new approaches you learn. For instance if you already know C++, you'll learn a lot less from learning Java than you would if you learned Lisp (or ML, or Haskell, or Smalltalk) - purely because the delta is much larger. Similarly, if you already knew Ruby you'd probably learn fewer new techniques learning Smalltalk than Haskell, and if you already grok Scheme you'll learn very little from Common Lisp.<p>If you are a C hacker, and especially if C is your first and primary language, Lisp just happens to be on the far other side of the wheel of languages, so you'll learn a heck of a lot from it.

In the beginning, there was only one app that used our services and it became a top-10 paid app.  Within weeks I found there were 6 or so apps that sprouted up in the App Store with similar names, exact functionality, yet they were not licensed to use our API and content.<p>The common thread?  They stole the original app's SQLite database, repackaged the interface, and off they went.  We blocked these apps from using our platform until they were licensed, but to this day I weekly see apps sprout up that are following the same nefarious business practice.  They steal content from a popular innovative app, repackage as their own, and throw it to the masses for the quick buck.<p>It is disgusting ecosystem.

However, I want to point out that if you want, you can sit and nitpick each one, pointing out how C is just fine on that front, and talk yourself into a position where it's not that big a deal, by focusing on one thing at a time and appearing to knock out each thing one by one. For this reason, ""enlightenment experiences"" tend to resist concretization; focus on just the words and you can talk yourself right out of them without much effort.<p>But the point is not the laundry list of bullet-point features, the point is the whole totality of the experience. There isn't a thing that Lisp can do that C can't be beaten into doing; for one thing, writing your own Lisplet isn't that hard (and a good exercise, too!), and there you have it, ""all of Lisp"" right there. But it makes those things so hard that you won't really want to do them. You can intellectually learn the value of some of the things that Lisp provides, but until you live for a while in an environment where they are <i>easy</i> you will never fully grok them.<p>Even though Lisp teaches nothing that could not be theoretically learned in C, in practice you won't learn them in C. The bar is too high, and if you're really trying to do it from scratch you'll make too many mistakes on things that were worked out 40 or 50 years ago. Learn something like Lisp.<p>(Haskell is another choice on that front; Lisp will teach you better metaprogramming, but Haskell has some advantages in <i>forcing</i> you to completely follow through with an alternate paradigm. Arguably Lisp is more practical for permitting such things, but less educational.)",1264433531

On the scale of things a closed product such as the iPhone is a fairly minor aberration.<p>Anyway to direct address your conclusion - pricing is always relative to quality/performance. Delivering clearly superior hardware at the same cost is also 'pricing'.

9762255,comment,9757913,9759889,0,0,wcunning,,,"So, upon further reading, I was less informed on that than I had thought. The best explanation I could find is here[1]. Basically, ANC does reduce sound pressure level when it lines up correctly. If you&#x27;re listening to the sort of ambient noise that it does well with, it gets the phase offset close enough to right to significantly reduce the mechanical force applied to your ear drums. If, on the other hand, you&#x27;re in an environment where it does a mediocre job, it will still be producing a cancellation waveform, but it won&#x27;t actually cancel anything, and that will increase the mechanical force applied to your ear drums. So, in an office environment, you&#x27;d expect a reduction from the ambient noise of the HVAC system, but an increase from the random nature of your coworkers&#x27; conversations. It&#x27;s hard to say whether you&#x27;d have a net reduction or not, but it&#x27;s not certain, whereas passive noise isolation is certain.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1ios4u/does_producing_antinoise_double_the_amount_of/cb6li32"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1ios4u/does_prod...</a>",1435024787

9762251,comment,9761769,9761769,0,0,geophile,,,"I visited Container Park in April, after having read a few articles about the Downtown project. I really wanted to like this place, and architecturally I thought it was pretty interesting. But the place didn&#x27;t make sense to me.<p>Container Park has a bunch of very narrowly focused businesses, in a small, 2-story space with insufficient traffic to support them. There was nothing resembling an &quot;anchor&quot; store to draw crowds and get this place going. As a result, it just seemed dead, lackluster.<p>Downtown LV is quite far from the strip, so tourists aren&#x27;t going to stumble on it. And it&#x27;s not even in the heart of downtown LV. To get there, you have to make a point of going there. And of course, LV makes it very tempting to stay in the big hotels and not venture all that far.<p>Some examples of the businesses: There was one store devoted entirely (I think) to socks. Another sold groceries, locally produced art, and art supplies. One store sold used designer bags and shoes. There were a few bars and restaurants, but nothing I&#x27;d go out of my way to patronize. In general: an odd collection of niche stores, with a few places to eat and drink.",1435024616

Each industry has enjoyed access to a wide and somewhat captive audience, and the accompanying profits, during a comparatively short period of time when they controlled the means of distribution. For music it was the era of the LP and CD. For journalism it was the era of the big print publications, and network radio and news. All that is done. Some other model for getting entertainment to people will emerge (is emerging), and some other model of letting people know what has happened will emerge as well (and perhaps is also emerging now).",1435024562

Notably that project:<p>- uses the JavaScript Math.random() API which is known to not be cryptographically secure.
- is not served over an HTTPS connection.
- requires re-download of all files to change language.
- tracks all page views with Google Analytics
- leaked information about the users preferred language via a URL query string parameter.
- used inline script tags which make it incompatible with lockdown via a Content Security Policy.<p>So I remedied all of these issues and re-factored and modernized the code. The source of randomness is now the well supported window.crypto.getRandomValues() API which is cryptographically secure. It now also uses a fully Bootstrap based UI and provides password strength feedback using the excellent zxcvbn library from Dropbox (<a href=""https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-pass...</a>).

Odds are that it is NOT algo&#x27;s.  Give your interviewer some really sloppy code to refactor into something beautiful. Give them a few hours to work on it, watch how they put the pieces together.<p>If your position isn&#x27;t going to require someone to write advanced algorithms on daily basis, testing for them only cuts out a huge swath of potential talent.

So in this case &quot;unstable&quot; really refers to the ubuntu &quot;distribution channel&quot;, not the kernel itself.<p>But really, you should expect it to take at least a few days to migrate to a more &quot;stable&quot; &quot;distribution channel&quot;. On Arch Linux, they often don&#x27;t migrate it before the &quot;x.x.1&quot; release. That&#x27;s because they make sure various out-of-tree kernel modules are still working, and they sometimes do need to apply a patch to fix a strange issue related to some hardware that&#x27;s being used slightly differently, and isn&#x27;t caught until after the &quot;x.x.0&quot; release which gains much wider usage than the release-candidates.<p>Ubuntu isn&#x27;t even a rolling-release distro like Arch is, so what you linked to is a special repo you can add for super up-to-date kernels if you really want them for some reason. But if you have no particular reason, you shouldn&#x27;t bother.

The state&#x27;s roll now is to further the interests of business.<p>This is great if you&#x27;re an employer but what are the consequences of shifting from a capitalist economy to a capitalist society?

The first one is straw man argument; not many people are arguing in favor of a Marxist paradise. And the market as a system of nature is simply delusional. A market economy is fine, most people agree on that. The problem is when the market model invades every last aspect of society and opposition is neither mon-existant or rendered impotent. The end result is a dictatorship of market fundamentalism.

That is due to many reasons I believe: 1) most people are not interested in learning about their own history, economy, geography, so it is hard to expect them to want to learn about another country. 2) the lack of role models or ambassadors; growing up in Africa we all knew a lot about the US mainly because of its economic strength, its history, but perhaps more importantly its ambassadors: pop stars, Michael Jordan and other NBA players, etc... I do not know many Chinese actors. I love Asian movies, I just re-watched IP Man I and II yesterday, but I am not even sure those actors are Chinese, Korean, Japanese, etc... China could do more to further promote its Arts and Culture.

It started off as a short reply but I kept coming back feeling &quot;It&#x27;s a programming language discussion, ugh. I really should elaborate.&quot;<p>Lots of people contributed to the Unix philosophy, but ESR&#x27;s contributions alone are 17 rules and people only tend to talk about 1-2 of them so that&#x27;s why I referred to them as &quot;oft-butchered.&quot;<p>I would say FP satisfies the Unix streams ideal due to how you transform data through functions and pass this data to other functions. Elixir&#x27;s pipe macro just makes this read more naturally. The modularity comes from the Erlang concept of &quot;applications&quot; and Elixir takes this further with umbrella applications.<p>I&#x27;ve written quite a bit of Elixir and I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve ever really needed to interop with the kernel or POSIX APIs at all. One of the reasons I use Elixir is because BEAM handles all of the crap I used to write in other languages (Async I/O APIs) to make them &quot;fast.&quot; Heck, a lot of people even think Erlang got microservices right nearly 30 years ago!<p>I did write some Go long before I ever wrote any Elixir so my experience is similar to OP. Go has a great niche in infrastructure tooling due to compiling to a binary, having a nice stdlib for tedious server-related things (TLS, crypto, etc). and supporting cross-compilation. That said, I&#x27;ll never write servers or business application logic in Go again. Elixir is just the better tool for the job there.",1435022757

Me too btw. :)<p>I see your point, yes that is absolutely true. I think one reason why Erlang is great because they realized that exposing the POSIX threading APIs to software developers is harmful. :) Why would you ever want to know how many cores you are running on? If you know it you have to keep track of it and adjust it on different systems and bunch of other issues. On the top of that POSIX threads are so expensive that it totally did not make any sense to implement a system that allows the developer to create a thread. I think Joe & team made an excellent decision there. On the other side, you can&#x27;t really access these low level primitives so this is I guess what you are talking about. For the low level stuff you need a systems language (C,Go whatever).<p>Oh, yeah, JVM based actors are kind of interesting. I am not sure how can they meet any latency SLA.

I hope people don&#x27;t mind me posting this here, please share and help me sell these domains and the website! Its all going to help a good cause and help me on my way to finish what I believe will be a great project in which hopefully some amazing hacks will come out of to help people like myself with cancer. Be it social networks or mole checker apps I am sure we are going to get some awesome stuff built at the hackathon.<p>Cheers

In 1998, you had to be somewhat diligent to get to a vantage point from which you could inject bogus BGP, and the Venn diagram between those people and &quot;nihilistic assholes&quot; is not that scary. In 2015, you can still <i>technically</i> fuck up BGP, but probably not for very long, and not without burning a lot of assets. Why would anyone bother?<p>The hunting and taxidermy of corrupted BGP advertisements is basically what got the NANOG crowd out of bed every morning; it&#x27;s a pretty big chunk of the job. I always felt like the alarmism over BGP was a bit tone-deaf. Certainly, nothing Peiter said came as any surprise to anyone who&#x27;d ever managed default-free peering.",1435021893

9762128,comment,9761470,9762003,0,0,istvan__,,,"&quot;However, they will not replace Go for a rather simple reason. Erlang is an application runtime first and a language second. It&#x27;s not meant to play with the native OS all that well, instead relying on its own scheduling, semantics, process constructs and the OTP framework. It exports a minimum set of OS libs for things like file system interaction, but you wouldn&#x27;t write a Unix subsystem daemon in it. Though, you certainly can - if you want to hack with NIFs, port drivers and C nodes. But then you put the global VM state at risk if some native caller blows up.&quot;<p>I have to disagree here. One of the best applications of modern times ever written in Erlang is Riak. It has lots os system services, they do IO a lot (it is a key-value store after all) and it works beautifully. It is using LevelDB under the hood for storing the data on disk and it is written in C++. Erlang makes it possible to have a distributed service using Erlang for the distributed parts and C++ for the disk IO combining the best of both worlds.<p>You are right about the potential NIF problems, but one shortcoming that can be possible worked around does not invalidate the rest of the system that is cutting edge.<p>How can you be sure that Erlang is great? Just look into projects like Akka and many more Scala project, they pick up features from Erlang because it simply works, easy to understand and reason about.<p>The notion of Erlang replacing Go is funny anyways because Erlang existed for much longer time than GO and even if you are looking in the web stack in Erlang it is pretty cool. Webmachine is one of the most stable tools out there, providing absolutely amazing latency and a state machine to handle HTTP requests.<p>Go as a language is new and certain way immature (like debugging and generics for example). It is an ok environment to develop in, but I would use Erlang/Elixir much more willingly for HTTP services (saying this after tried to use Go for a while but I just gave up, it was too much hassle for not too much gain).",1435021465

I can do so confidently because if Christianity is indeed the truth I believe it to be, then it will hold up, and if it&#x27;s not, it won&#x27;t.

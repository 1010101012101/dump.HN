3938116,comment,3937927,3938058,1,0,its_so_on,,,"I don't know.  Take contractors.  For many types of heavy lifting, a good contractor who is also a lead dev etc may be justified in asking for 100 dollars an hour or more, simply due to the complexity, their accumulated experience, and just how good and fast and right they are in a tech that's in demand.  However, for every person like that, there are n who do not justify a hundred dollars an hour.  So, isn't an OK compromise to start at 40 dollars an hour and see if they can do the work of 3 days (or a week or three weeks, or 'unusable') of one of the 'other' devs, more quickly or just better and more reliably, and if so, bump their rate to 100 dollars an hour as they're asking for?  Think like Oracle/SAP specialists etc who would do something like build a complete database and web shop, front-end, back-end, everything from scratch for a traditional brick-and-morter store.<p>To take an opposite example, consider a designer and logo creator.  Short of a portfolio, which many designers are not able to provide except to say, look at this, this, and this web site, which they did not work on alone, it is simply hard to know how much they contributed and how much was the art director, other designers, etc.  Some designers are independent and bring customers who pay well and basically justify any rate for themselves. (e.g. fifty thousand dollars for a new worldwide corporate logo for a fortune 500 company).  Others are worth fifteen dollars an hour.  Don't you think a good compromise might be a decent rate (25-40 dollars) for something small, then bump to awesome rate if, well, they're awesome?<p>Naturally this only works if there is actual trust from both sides.  But you would never pay fifty thousand dollars for a logo by someone who only knows microsoft paint and sucks using it -- or even ten thousand or even five thousand -- nor would you pay 100 dollars an hour to a ""hadoop engineer"" (your requirement) who turns out to not be a hadoop engineer, barely know some html and php, and even with php can't do anything that you want or need.  Nor would you pay 80 dollars nor 60 dollars an hour to that person.<p>So if there is trust that you're really looking for top talent -- and the dev's bullshit detector doesn't go off -- why not do this: ""Rather than you doing 10 hours of unpaid phone calls, resumes, interviews to get to 100 dollars an hour -- your next gig --  why don't you do 8 hours of work for me and get to the same place.  This applies only if you're worth 100 dollars an hour""<p>Then if the person is not lying (they're worth 100 an hour, they're an actual hadoop contributor and ju one of the best in the world), and you're not lying (you really want to pay that, for really such a person), it all works out.",1336377502

If he's using ""average"" in the sense of ""mean"" (not median), then he's saying that starting a startup has a lower expected return <i>and</i> is higher risk than working a normal job, meaning it's inferior in both regards (assuming diminishing marginal utility). Entrepreneurship is a classic ""high risk, high return"" venture.

Without seeing your posts and/or comments from around the time it happened I can't offer any suggestions or advice as to why it happened.  Do note that sometimes it happens by accident.  It happened to me the other day, and in a reply to an email I sent asking about it, PG said I'd been ""fat-fingered"" by accident.<p>With regards the algorithms, I have no inside knowledge, just deductions based on what I've seen and some experiments I've run.  However, if you consistently get flagged, or get downvoted vigorously, I suspect there is an automatic hell-ban, possibly preceded by a ""slow-ban"" (wherein everything slows down and responds like molasses for a while).  If PG was being completely honest (and I'm not suggesting he wasn't, but as a mathematician I tend to try to cover all bases) then some (and perhaps all) hell-bans are actually performed by the moderators, possible in response to flags thrown up by automated detection systems.<p>As an aside: Do you understand the effects of flags, downvotes, and their differences?<p>So if you want to know more, perform searches for ""hell-ban"", ""flag"", ""downvote"", ""dead"", and combinations thereof.

That in recent years we've got a couple of indie games that were successful, that's only because on mobile devices the expectations for CGI quality are for the moment low. Plus, with these app stores, the budget required for marketing has decreased, if you're lucky enough to have your app featured.<p>And while you can create indie games for the desktop and be successful, as Minecraft shows, the expectations for quality CGI are much higher and so it takes an insane amount of creativity to fill the blanks.<p>Now, of course, Zynga games are not really on the same level as what id Software or Blizzard are releasing and you can certainly picture yourself pulling off games of the same quality, as Zynga games are nothing special, except for the social-network effects.<p>However you shouldn't underestimate the effort required to build a game from scratch.

Component assemblers are the people fitting out bathrooms.<p>Creating new components is high-end engineering. It needs to happen far away from the day-to-day challenges of making a client happy.<p>To a large extent, this division is already present, but it doesn't go far enough. There has been amazing progress - nowadays we work on top of an incredible stack of technology that we don't have to re-invent, but so far we've not achieved the ""last mile"".<p>We'll know when we're there because component assembly (i.e. making something for a client) will start to look more like a trade.<p>Today, just getting a regular been-done-a-million-times-before database-driven website (or whatever), requires FAR too much low-level code.

Those indicators are processed within Toceas TechDebt.org database, therefore allowing you to assess the technical debt of your application vs all other projects that have already been analyzed as depicted in the boxes below. In addition to the benchmark information, the analysis results that are specific to your projects are made available in a dashboard you can access with a simple click from your Sonar platform. It provides you with valuable information for improving if needed the settings/quality profiles of your software quality measurement tools (ie: Sonar, PMD, Checkstyle), smartly managing the code remediation tasks, assessing the opportunity of a code refactoring, and the associated costs and savings.

3938085,comment,3937871,3938047,8,0,michaelneale,,,"Exactly - this article makes the very common (still) (1) mistake of thinking construction of software == writing code. Construction of software is compiler/interpreter/all the machinery that kicks in to take some text or instructions and makes it do something. To correct the analogy with building physical things - you could compare the architect designing a bridge (and arguing with engineers about materials and budgets) with writing code - that would be a fair comparison. The construction of software has been automated for some time.<p>This works just fine for construction of physical things because the cost sunk into to the ""non construction"" bit is tiny compared to the whole project - so no one spends too much time thinking about methodologies and automation of an architect coming up with the concept of a building.<p>(1) I note in the article the person mention spent time as a consultant in a big consulting company - this view is still held by them at least with the last brush I had with organisations like that (and they are incredibly frustrated by it).",1336376893
3938084,comment,3937871,3937871,3,0,manmal,,,"The analogy the OP establishes - building a house vs making software - is good (I've actually used it too in debates), but things are not as tightly regulated by the government as the OP claims:<p>* While there are certain constraints a house has to satisfy, architects do have freedom to be creative. They MUST plan such that it will resist certain standard incidents, and they have to plan it such that the floors can carry ~10x the weight you would ever expect there. These regulations vary depending on the region you live in. E.g., in Austria there is the possibility that meters of snow lie on roofs, and architects (or their structural designers) have to keep that in mind when calculating the max weight. You won't find this constraint in Portugal.<p>* Keeping to these constraints does not guarantee a building won't break. Constraints (like requirements) are prone to grow outdated, or be incomplete. In Austria, roofs will sometimes break down when it snows for some days in a row (4m of snow are very heavy).<p>* As incidents in e.g. Turkey and China show, plumbers or other construction workers can do such a bad job (""botching"") that buildings just break down after some years. Governmental constraints don't assure quality. Some countries like Dubai won't let local workers unguarded near any expensive building for this exact reason - most of the times, German and other Western workforces are hired to oversee the construction process.<p>I think one could compare governmental constraints on construction work with requirements. A building's floor must be able to carry a weight of 100 tons, and a software system should be able to serve 1000 requests/second - I think that's comparable, and software constraints might even be easier to test.<p>What I think this really boils down to is that software requirements evolve much more quickly, and due to this it's not feasible to establish legal requirements - government would have to issue new requirements every week, adjusting them for technologies like nodejs. Also, how do you establish best practices for bleeding-edge technologies within weeks? Not at all. We are in a constant state of learning and experimenting.",1336376831

Easy commoditisation is directly related to the tools one has at their disposal. Creative fields like photography or movie-making also face the same issues.<p>Interestingly, if we are given a choice to constantly upgrade our tools then we would always prefer to. For eg: I don't find most people using the cork screw on a swiss-army knife. I would rather have a lighter multi-tool. But redesigning, testing and manufacturing a new multi-tool takes a long time.<p>Software has relatively speaking a much shorter lifecycle. Most of the clients recognise this and sometimes have higher expectations of the turnaround times. This leads to unintentionally short timelines or bug-ridden software.<p>As in any uncertain venture, it is often better to go with iterative and agile methodologies rather than a big bang approach.",1336374649

You can do this for any objects for which it makes sense...  And it vastly improves the ease of coding and reading code.<p>In objective c, you simply can't improve it.  Tons of operations with containers and objects are unnecessarily syntactically unwieldy.  Higher level languages like Ruby do this as well, but C++ is fast and explicit.  If you want to know what the operator is doing, you can step into it.  You can read the code...",1336374584

Sure, hire for a trial run but don't insult your developer with old ""just do this one thing cheap and there will be properly paid work later"" line.

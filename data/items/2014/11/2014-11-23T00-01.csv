8647355,comment,8645571,8647303,0,0,ctchocula,,,"> Top play uses huge tradeoffs depending on what the progamer thinks they are facing; that would require an AI which can dynamically scout and effectively adjust its build based on what it sees. That isn&#x27;t even taking tricks into account.<p>I was thinking about that. Like what if they hired Flash to tell them everything he looks for when he scouts/scans at some time interval and then they factor them in as adjustments to build order or play using if-else statements. The possibilities are endless, but it must be a pain to test.<p>I never got into competitive Starcraft, because spending hours to acquire the mechanical ability in doing repetitive tasks seemed a waste of time to me. Perhaps they could build a rudimentary hard-coded bot that will aid the human player in all the boring tasks in executing a build order (base maintenance, unit building) and the human player scouts/combat micros against real players. Then later on, the replay gets analyzed and is used to train the bot in the next level of adaptive play. And the process is repeated, say the human player only does combat micro now. In each level the human requirement is reduced as the AI takes over increasing responsibility.",1416704283

In fact it is so common for sites to screw up here that browser vendors often resort to sending specially crafted UA strings to certain sites in order that the content become accessible. The most extreme example of this was pre-blink Opera which had much better compat than it was given credit for, but was often blocked — acidentially or intentionally — from sites that effectively whitelisted certain browsers. As a result it used an auto-updated list of sites for which it had to send an alternate UA string [1] as well as a sophisticated system of javascript injection to work around more complex bugs in these sites [2].<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/operasoftware/browserjs/blob/master/desktop/spoofs.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/operasoftware/browserjs/blob/master/deskt...</a>

I know these conversations are a dime a dozen--the odds that this leads to an acquisition are extremely low--but I want to approach it properly.  Should I share our financial metrics in a first conversation?  Should I try to push for anything to come of this or leave it to the analyst and her team to take the next step?<p>I&#x27;m not actively looking to sell the company, but I would certainly be interested in entertaining any partnership or acquisition offer if the terms are right.<p>(Throwaway account since I don&#x27;t want my thoughts on acquisition/partnership strategy tied to the company.)",1416702402

OpenSSH, PF, and now LibreSSL were all fairly rapidly developed at inception due to issues with the original projects they replaced. They made it into the base system within 1 or 2 releases (every 6 months in OpenBSD), so there&#x27;s no reticence to change or rapid development. However, they did take care to limit the projects to a well understood, readily achievable scope thus allowing them to ship on time (what a novel concept in software development!). OpenBSD also pioneered some major concepts in modern OS design such as privilege separation which has since been adopted by most other comparable operating systems. Yes, they do an excellent job of maintaining consistency, but a lot of that has to do with good design and careful choices, and not because they&#x27;ve avoided change.",1416702360

8647242,comment,8646787,8646787,0,0,apsec112,,,"Let&#x27;s do out the math on this...<p>A subway tunnel might have a diameter of about 6 meters, so cross section = 3 * 3 * pi = 28 square meters. Digging subway tunnel through rock costs about $100M per kilometer. On the one hand, these holes would be vertical, which is harder than horizontal; on the other hand, they wouldn&#x27;t need ventilation and train tracks and stuff. Let&#x27;s handwave and say it&#x27;s $100M for a 1 km deep hole.<p>Now, you can&#x27;t fill the whole tunnel perfectly or the air can&#x27;t escape, so our total volume of mass will be about 25 m^2 * 1000 m = 25,000 cubic meters. If the weights are made from lead, that&#x27;s a total mass of ~280,000 tons or 2.8 * 10^8 kg, at a mean depth of 500 meters, so our total potential energy is 2.8 * 10^8 * 500 * 9.8 = 1.4 TJ, or 1.3 TJ net assuming you get the efficiency they claim. 1 kWh is 3.6 MJ, so you can store ~400,000 kWh at $100M capital cost (ignoring for the moment the cost of weights, generators, etc.), which is $250 per kWh installed capacity.<p>That&#x27;s pretty good... but you also have to pay for weights and a bunch of other stuff. Bulk lead costs about $2,000 per ton on the current market, so that&#x27;s $560M for the weights, which puts you back in the $2,000 per kWh range which doesn&#x27;t beat lithium batteries. So you have to use iron or some cheaper material... but then you don&#x27;t have as much storage capacity because the density is lower, and even with iron you&#x27;re paying $400 per metric ton or $80M for all your weights. So this isn&#x27;t obviously impossible like Solar Roadways, but even in the best case it won&#x27;t make storage dramatically cheaper.",1416702263

If you&#x27;re going a build order that gets you straight-up killed by one of the most popular build orders, something is going wrong. Even if the enemy timing hits 5s before you get turrets up, your build should have a fallback e.g. marines in the base to hold off mutas until turrets complete, which is what a lot of progamers do off a 4-rax opening. Your (x-2) minutes statement seems to assume that AI builds can&#x27;t cut corners and are forced to play the safest build possible every game.<p>> Since even the top humans are able to trick each other in these manners, you&#x27;d basically need general/strong AI to be able to compete.<p>This flies in the face of game theory, which is focused on solving exactly the problem you deem impossible to solve without strong AI. In 2008, poker bots (researched by the same university, the University of Alberta) have been able to defeat human experts in limit heads-up poker [1].<p>Perhaps the problem statement the researchers are working with is different from the one I&#x27;m envisioning. Maybe they are training their bots with only replays from other bots, rather than with replays from the top players in the world which constitute what we currently regard to be optimal play. I am thinking that the researchers may overlap with the poker research group, which suggests that the entire project is more focused on using superior game theory as the winning condition rather than exploiting areas where the computer is already known to be better than the human e.g. micro (giving hundreds of units unique instructions) and macro (sending build commands to buildings on the clock). The former is shown in the wraith vs. hydralisk video [2]. This may not work as well as in poker and may not yield as impressive games in the short-term as focusing on micro and macro, but the research is definitely fascinating!<p>[1] <a href=""http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/man-machine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/man-machine/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcjQhig88wE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcjQhig88wE</a>",1416702224

So far, only a few thousand miles of road have gotten the treatment .., The company frequently says that its car has driven more than 700,000 miles safely, but those are the same few thousand mapped miles, driven over and over again.<p>... Safety is at stake here; Chris Urmson, director of the Google car team, told me that if the car came across a traffic signal not on its map, it could potentially run a red light, simply because it wouldn&#x27;t know to look for the signal. Urmson added, however, that an unmapped traffic signal would be &quot;very unlikely,&quot;<p>...

Caches for geographical distribution are actually a form of decentralization! The problem with the existing ones is that they are mostly under centralized control, but there is no technical reason why that has to be, and an ISP&#x27;s caching web proxy (which weren&#x27;t that uncommon back in the day) is a simple example of caching infrastructure under decentralized control that could help an ISP reducing the load on their upstream connection for often-requested content. You don&#x27;t need youtube to copy a video from your machine to the cache at some viewer&#x27;s ISP, that&#x27;s just the way it is commonly done right now because in that way youtube can make money - or, if you want to decentralize further, you could copy to a cache on the machine of some customer of said ISP in some geographic region: The more requests there are for some content, the more likely it is that there is a copy in your neighbourhood that doesn&#x27;t need to be transferred from the original source.",1416701146

That's a rhetorical question, because I'm 99% sure the answer is ""no.""  So I suppose my real questions are:<p>1. Isn't that a conflict of interest?
2. How do I know the money is going where you say it's going?
3. If you're donating this revenue to charities via the affiliate fees you pocket, are you getting the tax benefits of that?  i.e., Amazon credits your affiliate account via the activity of your users.

1170591,comment,1169875,1169875,0,0,mcantor,,,"I enjoyed the point about prepending sentences with ""I think.""  I have found that, during emotional discussions with friends or loved ones, it also behooves us to prepend many phrases with ""I feel like.""<p>The common nerd defense to this approach is to cry, ""But <i>I'm</i> saying it... of course it's just <i>my</i> opinion!"" or, ""Of course it's just my feelings!""  However, prepending a sentence with ""I think/I feel like..."" indicates that you are not one of those frustrating people who refuses to consider other people's emotions and opinions.<p>Additionally, ""You don't consider my emotions enough"" and ""It feels like you don't consider my emotions enough"" are two <i>wildly</i> different phrases, no matter which way you slice it.<p>By prepending that sentence with ""it feels like,"" we profoundly alter its meaning.  The first sentence indicates an objective truth for which the listener can be <i>blamed</i>.  The latter sentence indicates nothing except the speaker's <i>internal feelings</i>, which--for the most part--cannot be consciously controlled.<p>No one is to blame for feelings: they simply <i>are</i>, and denoting a sentiment as ""a feeling"" rather than ""a fact, which may be your fault,"" is a vital tactic for communicating constructively on a deep emotional level.<p>Many nerds approach debates and communication with a feeling of entitlement to being understood.  ""I have spent a lot of time learning what I know, and if someone else can't understand it when I explain it to them, it is their problem, not mine.""  Unfortunately, this leads to severe communication issues with everyone, including other nerds.<p>If you want someone else to understand something, and they don't get it, <i>it is your problem</i> as much as it is theirs.  Maybe if you never have to deal with that person ever again,  nor anyone else who <i>they</i> have to deal with, and so on, it is not your problem.  But if they are a friend, colleague or loved one, it inarguably behooves you to go out of your way to make them understand what's going on in your head.  Only mutual understanding of needs and desires will provide us with the opportunity to reach constructive conclusions to our problems.",1267826030

That's why it's illegal to deny a job applicant based on those attributes.<p>But when it comes to dating, those attributes are relevant! Incredibly relevant!

It's Stockholm's sprawl, built in the 60's to handle population growth as Sweden urbanized.<p>The subway runs parallel to the highway, with regional draws (factories for employment, big shopping like Ikea) by the highway and local shopping like a grocery store, a small mall (Skarholmen Centrum), post office, etc clustered around the subway stop (the ""T"" on the map).  There are apartments (3-6 stories) clustered around the Centrum, then townhouses beyond that and some houses beyond that.  Nearby stops have small grocery stores (similar to a CVS or Walgreens) and apartments around them, and if people need more stuff they ride the train to Skarholmen.  For specialized stuff they ride into Stockholm or drive/bus to the big stores by the highway.  So most people don't need cars even for work or shopping.<p>Overcrowding?  No, apartments are very affordable so people don't need to pack into them.  Concrete jungle?  Hardly, there are parks between every apartment building and raw forest less than a mile away.<p>So what's missing from here?

A big help (if you're new to them) is viewing the threads as players in a turn based board game where your lines of code are squares on the board and everyone gets a random roll.<p>Some uses (personal (of various sizes) and enterprise):<p>- Background worker that wanders off, does some shit and then says: ""yo, I finished"".<p>- Subsystems and services: Sometimes you just have ""stuff"" that is going on. An example would be a little doohickey I got monitoring the USB. It handles a little protocol so it can identify stuff our system knows about that gets plugged in (on any port). This is so when the ""main"" part of the app asks for an ""external XYZ"" device it can return the device (or a ""null"" Object if it is not connected).<p>- To preserve your intentions: If you broadcast events with your own thread it is possible for a consumer to chomp on your thread's processing time, so sometimes you need to spin off a background thread/s to do the event firing to free you up so you get back to your job.",1267824719

(My wife is a doll - ""You want to visit a neighborhood outside of Gainesville?  O...K..."")<p>To address the major criticism (affordability and lack of economic mixing): each NU development requires haggling over special zoning, density, and street engineering, so there's a greater up front cost and risk for the developer which gets passed on to buyers.  Second, there are very few NU housing units relative to standard suburban houses so demand outstrips supply, keeping prices high.  Third, they make a conscious effort to be attractive and pleasant, both in the houses and neighborhood as a whole, so people are willing to pay higher prices.  With explicit zoning approval, developers could build more units and there would be more competition so prices would go down.  The end result would probably be prices about the same as standard houses, with a smaller lot, slightly smaller house, but in a more attractive, liveable neighborhood.<p>The biggest weakness I see is that they have only been done on the scale of a subdivision so it hasn't really effected shopping or employment patterns.  Sure, many of them have pleasant town centers, but they get low traffic and are therefore much more suitable for professional offices or a few local things like a dry cleaner or child care.<p>New Urbanism is useful mainly as a showcase of how residential development could be.  The work that has the potential to change the built environment much more are form-based zoning codes, also by Duany Plater-Zyberk.  It basically specifies the envelope you're allowed to build in based on where you are but doesn't specify function.  So in a dense district where 6 story buildings are allowed, it doesn't matter whether they are offices, condos, light manufacturing, etc, just as long as they're consistent with the form of the neighborhood and the road and transit capacity.  Form based codes actually deal with the entire economy of residential, commercial, and office/light-industry, while New Urbanism only (in practice) deals with residential.<p>If a fast-growing municipality were to adopt these, it would give a good feel for what level of density and urbanity people were actually willing to buy.  Urbanity and density that is a) low crime and b) has acceptable schools is extremely high priced because zoning has made it illegal to build almost everywhere.",1267823788

So the girls desperately respond to every message, and the guys don't seem interested -- there is a large supply of girls they like, and a small supply of guys.

Haskell isn't quite <i>unique</i> in that (Erlang arguably falls here too), but it is very unusual.

Technically, you can figure out the bytes needed out of the packfile from the index that is downloaded, so I suppose it is possible.  However, it would still be way slower than smart-http, because you would have to walk the refs one by one on the client side - one GET, figure out the next object, another GET, etc.  With smart-http, you do a short back and forth until the server can figure out the entire list of objects you need and then build a custom packfile for you.<p>And it still wouldn't help push in any way.",1267823041

It's entirely dependent on the brakes involved and the engine involved; any given vehicle could go either way.  I personally have witnessed steel brake rotors melted and dripping off the vehicle; the brakes had locked up at highway speed and the driver had continued driving, reporting afterwards that the vehicle seemed a little sluggish but not excessively so, so he hadn't stopped.  For that vehicle: the brakes lost.  For other vehicles, perhaps ones with dinky engines and big fat brakes: the brakes may win.  It's certainly not the sort of thing where one can say ""brakes always win"".<p>Car and Driver's article ( <a href=""http://www.caranddriver.com/features/09q4/how_to_deal_with_unintended_acceleration-tech_dept"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.caranddriver.com/features/09q4/how_to_deal_with_u...</a> ) seems to assume that Toyotas don't cut the engine power when the brakes are applied, but their own tests belie that.  I would guess that Toyota's software cuts the power LESS than the competition's software does.  But if you're stopping from 70mph with and without the throttle at full, and you notice a minimal difference - as C&D did - I can guarantee you that the throttle is being reduced when the brakes are applied.  Maybe not to zero, but reduced.",1267822986

Running ""git push production"" is as explicit as ""./deploy-to-production.sh"".<p>Also, nothing against scripting. Mercurial needed a small hook, too. But Git's default push behaviour is not only worthless, it's dangerous and risks unexpected reverts of changesets. I already explained this in: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1158563"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1158563</a><p>Git should either have a <i>sane</i> default implementation, or should refuse to push to non-bare repositories. But its current implementation doesn't make any sense. Providing dangerous defaults because people shouldn't use it anyway? That's plain ignorance.<p>(However, I agree that automatic deployment is indeed a bad idea, no matter whether it uses push or pull. But that's off-topic.)",1267822909

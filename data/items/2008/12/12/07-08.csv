This is the restructuring of a global economy that had become far too reliant on debt. More companies and industries will go under; more jobs will be lost. Remember, the employees may not have chosen the company strategy, but they chose to be with that company.<p>I will dance on the grave of every company and industry that dies now because it means the restructuring is working. Nobody is putting them on life support. Nobody is saying, ""It's okay you royally fucked up."" They're dying, as they should be.",1229068530

395466,comment,395389,395457,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Auto industry jobs will only be lost due to lowering demand, which won't change with or without the bailout. For one, American car companies won't disappear. Read up on Chapter 11. They'll be restructured. Some layoffs may occur, but they need to anyway, otherwise this bailout would only forestall the inevitable. The only way American car companies can compete long term is to get down to similar cost basis to foreign ones, which means their cars have to take a similar amount of man hours to build.<p>And if they did fold, people won't just stop buying cars. They'll just buy different cars that were made mostly here in America, which employee the same number of people to build that a viable American car company would.<p>It's easy to say bailout = jobs, but that's sadly just not true. In the long run it won't save any, and it will cost a fortune. If it's done right, it will ensure viability, which means loss of jobs. If it's not done at all, it will mean restructuring and/or a shift to Japanese cars which means the same loss of jobs.",1229067362

Its an industry that scales easily.<p>The auto industry on the other hand, is getting grilled left and right over a measly 15 billion. The money comes with a ton of strings attached. Even though unlike the financial industry they produce a tangible product. And there are no other competitors waiting to fill the big boy's shoes, because it takes billions to scale.<p>So it seems to me that the Congress is being penny smart and pound foolish, they give away vast sums w/o a second thought, and then turn around and penny pinch when it comes to a tiny amount.",1229067040

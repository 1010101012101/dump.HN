And Moore himself wrote a memo endorsing a more general use of the term &quot;Moore&#x27;s Law&quot; for any chip performance metric that doubles regularly.  I can&#x27;t find a copy online but I have it in my old Computer Architecture lecture notes.

The language doesn&#x27;t try to help the programmer with even the most basic of these sort of resource management problems. Most modern languages offer tools to handle some subset of them (e.g. GC for memory in managed languages, or destructors for memory and more in C++/Rust), reducing the burden on the programmer for normal resource life cycles and hopefully making it easier to handle the abnormal cases better.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s not generally possible for a language to perfectly manage every resource all the time, but this doesn&#x27;t mean we should just give up and throw away computer assistance in cases when we can have it.<p>C is an important language, but there&#x27;s no need to look at it through rose-coloured glasses.",1445263122

JS is too weak a language to implement this syntactic sugar inside of it, so there is a need for an external tool.

It&#x27;s really an issue of maintenance. The more technical debt you have on a project, the longer any round of maintenance will take. Even simple tools that are just slapped together quickly might be easier to rewrite than modify, but rewriting them each time results in a different sort of technical debt. Implementation X has features used by user A, implantation Y has features used by user B, so now both tools have to be maintained or you try for Implementation Z that tries to pull it all back together (but probably fails, because you&#x27;re still not properly budgeting time and engineers).<p>Overengineering is still a problem, but underengineering is the one I run into more often.",1445262733

The approach taken is the right one: we do something very similar with the Squire rich text editor (<a href=""https://github.com/neilj/Squire"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/neilj/Squire</a>) which I wrote for FastMail&#x27;s webmail. Basically the browser can&#x27;t be trusted to do any formatting itself, which is a slightly depressing state of affairs, especially as there has been zero improvements in this area for the last 5 years. I guess it&#x27;s not shiny enough for browser devs to focus on.<p>Looking through the code, a few things jumped out that should be looked at:<p>* Native TreeWalker implementations are buggy in some browsers. In the end we decided it was safer to just implement the bit we needed ourselves (see comment at top of <a href=""https://github.com/neilj/Squire/blob/master/source/TreeWalker.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/neilj/Squire/blob/master/source/TreeWalke...</a>).<p>* The HTML sanitisation using document.implementation doesn&#x27;t account for DOM clobbering so is currently bypassable with the right malicious content. I recommend using <a href=""https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify</a> for this rather than writing your own. It&#x27;s tricky to get all the edge cases right, so better to use something that&#x27;s been reviewed by several people (and in DOMPurify&#x27;s case also undergone a formal security review).

10412845,comment,10412270,10412517,0,0,jerf,,,"In the 1990s when Python et al were being created, static typing <i>really sucked</i>, plus you were almost always working in a really complicated environment like Windows or something where the details of the OS were sticking out of the types of way too many of the function you wrote.<p>So it was easy to switch to Python and come to the conclusion that it was all the static typing&#x27;s fault, because that was the most obvious difference between the languages of the time and Python/Perl/etc.<p>But it&#x27;s 20 years later now, and the statically-typed languages have not been standing still. They&#x27;re a lot easier to work in now, even for prototyping in my experience. Go, which I mention since it&#x27;s on topic, is reasonably fluid with its interfaces and structural typing. It isn&#x27;t quite Python&#x27;s level of fluid, but I also find it doesn&#x27;t take <i>that</i> long before the static typing wins start to balance out anyhow when it tells me about problems before they&#x27;ve metastasized because I didn&#x27;t know about them and kept going.<p>The whole functional programming world with its type inference is fairly fluid to work in, and when it gives errors, I find they tend to be <i>real errors</i>, even in your prototyping code, that really do need to be addressed before you can compile. (If you get good at it, prototyping is actually <i>really easy</i> in Haskell, but there is an up-front investment.) Optional/incremental typing, despite my general distaste for them [1], also can be easy to work with. And even some of the old school statically-typed languages are easier than they used to be, because you can find some abstraction layer that isolates you from the sort of thing that made the 1990s a really crazy time to program in.<p>So, it helps to use a language that doesn&#x27;t date back to the time of Python&#x27;s origination.<p>The only thing inconvenience that truly static typing brings to prototype code in my experience is that it really wants you to push a given change all the way through the code base, when you may just want to experiment with it on one code path. Generally there&#x27;s a way to just beat the compiler down, though. And when you&#x27;ve learned the art of using types to mean things, and when you&#x27;ve learned to read what type errors mean and that they are not just a content-free shouting of &quot;NO!&quot;, the ability to harness what the errors mean and react to them quickly in your design, rather than bake them into your code accidentally, can end up being a net gain, even in mere hours of work.<p>[1]: Mostly a consequence of the fact that, as I&#x27;m describing in the rest of this post, static typing is a lot easier than it used to be, which means I consider incremental typing to mostly be solving a problem that no longer exists. YMMV.",1445262375

The other had a mother that came from a very poor background with uneducated parents but paid her way through college and become a high end Executive on Wallstreet, and pushed her daughter to have the same ambition she did.<p>All three of our ex boyfriends however came from multigenerational inherited affluent wealth with stories about their grandparents creating legacies at fancy boarding schools and their parents played a role in everything they did. While this did print them a resume to get into a good college (and they were also smart and did actually perform well in school but that&#x27;s ALL they had to do, was show up to classes chosen for them and do well). Once they got there, academically they were unmotivated and did poorly in classes while playing video games. When they graduated all three of them had &quot;no idea&quot; what they wanted to do post college. They all got ok jobs making entry level salaries but have sat in those positions for going on 5 years, miserable.<p>Meanwhile the three of us females were, in college: doing graduate research, taking grad classes, working part time jobs and had both started, taught ourselves investing etc etc. and now going on 5 years post college we are all age 26: one is the director of Marketing for a top ranked Bank, One of the cofounder of a trending tech startup, and I work in Engineering for a nonprofit in energy resources setting precedents in the Supreme court and free market economics for challenging resource monopolies and making energy resources more competitive, and all have surpassed our ex boyfriends salaries years ago....<p>All three of us one night discovered that not only had we all done our boyfriends resumes in college and updated them since college, all three of them asked us to do it for them, because their parents were sick of doing them as they had created them for their college admissions as well. Hmm...interesting...<p>Our exes  were sitting at home in dead end jobs they admittedly hated, but couldn&#x27;t stop playing Halo to update their resume unless their mothers called them and told them to do so, or their dads offered to look around for an opening in their respective companies. It boggles our mind but more importantly..<p>this same lackadaisical &quot;wait for somebody else to swoop in and solve this problem for me&quot; attitude became a problem in our interpersonal relationships. All of them had a hard time expressing their emotions or even being in touch with them, or knowing what they wanted or even verbalizing their own perceptions of problems because all of those things? someone had been doing that for them their whole lives.<p>This left all of  usfrustrated with emotionally disconnected exes sitting at home not even knowing how to work on their own problems, much less adequately address issues in a relationship that involves two independent humans. All three of them kept running back to their estate to take time &quot;off&quot; and pout whenever a problem occurred at work or personally and hide from their problems while their mothers doted on them.<p>It also caused us to decrease our sympathy for them over time because they had everything handed to them yet still had excuses about why they hated their jobs and life so much. But we came from a world where excuses were not a luxury we had if we wanted not even a successful life but an even slightly comfortable one.<p>Meanwhile, we are traveling the world, doing well in our careers and also trying to figure out how to verbalize their perspective and then ask them if what we said was what they were feeling. Like, we had to present multiple choice options for them because they had no voice of their own.<p>Needless to say, these relationships did not work out. Everyone has issues and we were willing to admit to our own and take constructive feedback, but there was no constructive feedback, because they had never had to do that in their lives.<p>The most heartbreaking part was, in their careers and in their personal lives, they wanted a good career and they didn&#x27;t want us to leave them, but they had burned their bridges and were left clueless on how to go about to their next phase of life. It was sad but we did not have time to raise children as 25 yr old females busting our tails in the tech environment. There&#x27;s a reason we don&#x27;t have kids right now, because we don&#x27;t have time.<p>We each loved them dearly but we needed emotional equality and people who supported our ambitions and also had their own.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if these issues were also paired to be more likely outcomes with their personality types, or what the true root cause is, as I&#x27;m an Engineer, not a psychologist, but being able to talk to someone else going through the same thing, we saw some eerily similiar trends, and it always related back to their parents effectively babying them in areas of their life, that were embarassing from the perspective of highly independent and motivated people we had to be to effectively reach the same socioeconomic status they were born into.<p>Moral of the story: While having an Engineer Degree is important for Engineering (but not so much coding if at all)<p>the MORE important factors in success are\n1. Knowing what you want and going after it<p>2. Being self motivated<p>3. Being able to clearly communicate your position whether its emotions, needs, or negociating a raise or why you feel you are up for the challenge of a new job position, etc<p>4. independent ability to not only\na. identify\nb. define, but\nc. solve problems on your own<p>Sorry helicoptor parents but your missing the point. As someone else said earlier (whom I completely disagree with) he said &quot;helicoptor parenting is working, get them into stanford and then they have the rest of their lives to fail&quot;<p>woops, college is not the ends to a means, its a means to an end and if the means is handed to them, then they will not be able to fish in the real world by themselves.

Since there are behavioral and psychological traits influenced by genetics that promote greater desire for children, this seems far fetched. (I don&#x27;t have a citation, but this seems almost certain.)<p>Rate of evolutionary change depends on the selection pressures on the allele in question. There are formulas for calculating both the probability a mutant allele goes to fixation[1] as well as the expected number of generations for it to do so[2]. With high selective pressures evolution on the scale of a few thousand years is certainly possible - the time taken for lactase persistence to develop in humans is estimated at around 3,000 years.[3] In the extreme case, if all individuals lacking a given dominant allele are removed from the population, it would only take a single generation. So, no. Though I admit the number of generations does increase with the natural log of the population size, so it would take longer with greater population sizes.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biomath/tutorials/applications/MutantGene01.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biomath/tutorials/application...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=2zVqBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA466&lpg=PA466"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=2zVqBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA466&lpg=...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase_persistence#Evolutionary_history"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase_persistence#Evolutiona...</a><p><i>Buffalo</i> - Current population estimates are around 500,000 in the US. Given that large herds of protected buffalo and many locations with low light pollution still exist, you&#x27;ve failed to provide any examples of experiences that are forever gone.<p>Of course some situation can always be constructed. You can&#x27;t find 20-30 million buffalo anymore, just as extinct animals are gone (ignoring current work by George Church and others on de-extinction), just as no two people can simultaneously be the US President or first man on the moon. Some <i>particular version</i> of experiences are constantly being made unavailable, and that&#x27;s a fact of life regardless of population.<p>As for the Plains Indians, I don&#x27;t think that genocide was caused by overpopulation so much as the US government&#x27;s desire for westward expansion. Sure, it might not have happened if the population had stayed much smaller, but those aren&#x27;t the only two possible outcomes. It&#x27;s not as if resource availability had been exhausted in the east.<p>Aside from that, if you go back and read, you&#x27;ll see my claim was that there are advantages to larger population, not that it was necessarily a moral imperative. (The only argument for it as a moral imperative I can think of would rely on the assumption that future unborn lives should have moral relevance to us now.) Even if I were arguing that claim, it would be equally paternalistic for one to dictate what state the world should be in simply to protect experiences they prefer.",1445262258

This is a tremendous historical discovery, especially for historians of the early English Reformation. The KJV formed the mind of British Christianity for centuries, which in turn formed the mind of the British Empire. In other words, the KJV translation is important not merely for early Reformation studies, but for world history more generally. Anything that could give historians greater insight into the process of the KJV translation, as well as the theology (theologies?) of its translators, is a great discovery.<p>(A side-note regarding the Empire and Christianization: in the early centuries of the Empire, the British were primarily interested in trade and conquest, but not so much in evangelization and conversion of native peoples. The East India Company (EIC) was a good example of this: as long as profits and goods flowed in from India, the leaders of the EIC were content not only to leave native religions alone, but even to intermarry with native Muslims and Hindus and allow each wife to raise her children in her own particular faith tradition. Hence the creation of a new ethnicity: the Anglo-Indian. However, in the 19th century, an evangelical revival effected a sea-change in British Christianity, and thus the Empire became a vast instrument of evangelization and conversion. At this point, I think, the KJV became important for world history, rather than British history in particular.)",1445260887

Under their leadership many English Catholic gentry families settled in Maryland. However, the colonial government was officially neutral in religious affairs, granting toleration to all Christian groups and enjoining them to avoid actions which antagonized the others. On several occasions, low-church dissenters led insurrections which temporarily overthrew the Calvert rule. In 1689, when William and Mary came to the English throne, they acceded to demands to revoke the original royal charter. In 1701, the Church of England was proclaimed, and in the course of the 18th century Maryland Catholics were first barred from public office, then disenfranchised, although not all of the laws passed against them (notably laws restricting property rights and imposing penalties for sending children to be educated in foreign Catholic institutions) were enforced, and some Catholics even continued to hold public office.<p>- The Province of Pennsylvania was founded by Quakers, but the colony never had an established church.<p>- The Province of New Jersey, without official religion, had a significant Quaker lobby, but Calvinists of all types also had a presence.<p>- Delaware Colony had no established church, but was contested between Catholics and Quakers.<p>- The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, founded by religious dissenters forced to flee the Massachusetts Bay colony, is widely regarded as the first polity to grant religious freedom to all its citizens, although Catholics were barred intermittently. Baptists, Seekers/Quakers and Jews made this colony their home. The King Charles Charter of 1663 guaranteed &quot;full liberty in religious concernments&quot;</i><p>Per a following table, Connecticut and Massachusetts retained their established religions for 2-3.5 decades, and New Hampshire and South Carolina for a couple of years after the Constitution was ratified.<p>Moving to interpretation, if you believe self-defense et. al. are natural, unalienable rights, the 2nd Amendment merely acknowledges that, and its current near total abridgment is meaningless outside of what various governments believe they can, and indeed do.<p>By that, I mean that while <i>Heller</i> and <i>McDonald</i> say we have a right to keep a gun available for self-defense in the home, D.C. and NYC can and do effectively forbid this, and there&#x27;s no prospect that&#x27;ll change for NYC, while the court cases in D.C. look to drag on for many more years (Chicago&#x27;s ban got zapped by <i>McDonald</i>).<p>But then there&#x27;s that pesky &quot;and <i>bear</i> arms&quot; bit, not covered by the Supremes except in the context of your home (yep, D.C. forbid that), and not recognized outside of the 7th United States courts of appeals (i.e. Illinois) or by the Supremes, and being litigated in the 9th, where it will probably lose, and D.C. where it&#x27;s dragging on like mere ownership.<p><i>Anyway</i>, the point of the above three paragraphs of details going into the weeds for most people is that even based on a much more solid textual and contextual foundation, the simple English words of the 2nd Amendment <i>in practice</i> allow for about as much interpretation as we see in practice happening with the Bible.

This certainly makes for some very amazing products, but I can’t help feeling a little disillusioned. The amount of time and energy that goes into fun, but ultimately useless ideas, rather than fixing some of these hidden problems is mind-numbing.<p>On the other hand, the older generations are exposed (aware or unaware) to a lot of these hidden problems. They have experience on how to solve them because they understand them. Yet by that time, most of them have to provide for a family, pay of their mortgage, tuition fees, healthcare, yearly vacations and the 3 cars. They also often lack the imagination on how to solve things in a new technological paradigm.<p>So I now realized that there is a potential goldmine of problems we simply don’t know of, because the people who are exposed to them aren’t connected with the people who have the opportunity and creativity and energy to solve them.

Other architectures focus on either bandwidth, parallelism (but often without a great synchronization story), and optimizing power usage. So I doubt that Go lang would benefit from moving to Power.<p>Some choices the Go people made about how channels how limited their options for optimizing channels / increase the complexity of a lock-free implementation (don&#x27;t have the mailing list link handy).

I&#x27;ve thought a lot about the slashdot/HN mispredictions of future successes and my random thoughts:<p>1) A flawed Theory of Mind applied to the general public:  I think it&#x27;s fairly safe to say that the technical crowd (which includes commentators of slashdot/HN) will lean towards the Asperger/autism spectrum.  It&#x27;s easy for geeks/nerds/experts (especially vocal ones) to misjudge how products could be accepted by the masses (who are <i>not</i> geeks/nerds/experts).  The famous examples being the slashdot dismissal of the iPod in 2001 and the iPad in 2009.  (And Sara McGuire&#x27;s article that this thread is about has more examples from HN.)<p>2) Skepticism/negativity is easier to itemize and write, and as a strange bonus, it is <i>perceived</i> as smarter and more insightful analysis.  Looking at all the things that are &quot;wrong&quot; with a product might be described as a type of &quot;closed-ended&quot; thinking.  On the other hand, imagining the different ways a product could succeed involves more &quot;open-ended&quot; analysis.  The problem of writing open-ended thoughts is that it looks like naive futurism, or unsophisticated cheerleading.  (E.g. haha, Back to the Future&#x27;s Bob Gale thought we&#x27;d have hoverboards in 2015!  Dean Kamen thought Segways would sell millions of units and would revolutionize the world! etc).<p>Because of the combinations caused by faulty Theory of Mind and biases towards the shortcomings of products, the commentary on new business ideas will almost always end up being negative.",1445260403

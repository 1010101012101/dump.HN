  trace of bitterness. Every cup of coffee was excellent to my taste.""
</code></pre>
Italian espresso is good because of consistent dosing. If you go in a coffee bar in Italy, chances are they don't have a grinder in house. They're using vacuum-sealed pre-ground coffee, and dosing very exactly before making espresso.<p>The industrial grinders they use to pre grind all of that espresso you were drinking give extremely consistent grinds, and the packaging lets it sit on shelves for months at a time. It's not even particularly high-quality coffee.<p>Don't take my word for it though:<p><pre><code>  In Italy, espresso is a mass consumption item, mostly made from 
  coffees of the same low quality as is found in supermarkets 
  everywhere. Since the aromas of such coffees are not all that 
  great, staling is of little consequence, while keeping doses 
  precise and yields high is of great consequence, since one 
  needs to extract every iota of caramel to make the shots 
  palatable. So the ground coffee sits in dosers going stale, 
  but is precisely dosed, 6.5 grams into single baskets, 13 
  into doubles.

The article is 20+ years old, yet it somehow seems universal even today. I did a LOT of overtime, and often ""just"" to make a decent work that I wouldn't be ashamed to put my name on. I also met other grad students who wasted most of their time at the office on trivia (lunch, coffee, newspapers), people who rarely talked to their supervisors, people only superficially interested in their work, as well as people who did not really like what they were doing, yet they were striving to do their best. During my PhD years I learned at least as much about myself, academia and different kinds of people that I'm going to meet later in life, as about CS. One of the most important lessons was learning how to handle people who treat their work as a 9-5 chore instead of something to excel in.<p>--<p>Long time ago, while I was still an undergrad student, I asked one of the professors about grad studies.

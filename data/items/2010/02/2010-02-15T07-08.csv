But a possible risk is that they do scan for cloaking and automatically deduct for that. Though that would be a rather sophisticated system. Then again, they are Google.<p>Oh yeah, Google's tech support system sucks btw. Someone would make big bucks if they found a way to make that fun and efficient for their tech support staff. Tech support in general. It's rarely fun to call in to tech support. Shouldn't it be fun? Zappos style. Duuude: SMS text support. Text your initial question, and someone calls you.

This makes the reservations a bit more reliable, as no one throws money just like that.<p>The seller doesn't consider these as actual purchases yet. It is only a demand aggregation, meaning grouping people that care strongly about the price. After the deadline or max quantity, the item closes. At this point the seller gives real payment instructions, but at a different price. Of course there is the risk that not all will complete the purchases but isn't that already included in the price? The seller can count lets say a 50% completion rate already when making the prices?<p>What you described is awesome and a real hacker's view. I think it is very cool and have to admit I have been thinking similar in this direction at the beginning. But.. I have an obvious problem getting this solution explained to  a hacker community (see my comments here). I wonder how I would explain the solver to consumers and sellers. :D I need a solver for a headache later.<p>Thank you for awesome reasoning and comment!

What I'm implying is that the vast majority of values only have one static type, if your static analysis is good enough.<p>The question of ""which is better"" wasnt really a factor in my decision to build a static compiler instead of a JIT.

For example, revenue per day in a subscription business is going to be dominated by the anniversary dates for existing accounts.  Is that useful to know?  No, that is noise.  Condense it into revenue per month and then you have a useful top-level overview of whether your efforts are bearing fruit or not.<p>3)  One line on one graph.  At most, two.

5749430,comment,5748924,5749128,10,0,yk,,,"3/50 is I think a meaningless failure rate. If the system overlooks 3 out of every 50 pedestrians standing on the road by themselves and happily runs them over, then it is certainly unacceptable. If there is a test, in which the system is shown groups of pedestrians, in total 50 and it mistakes a group of 3 for a large immobile object, then it is probably acceptable, as long as it always labels pedestrians as 'do not run over.'<p>And for the entire fleet of autonomous cars, the system does not need to be safe. It just needs to be better than humans driving. Realistically to gain acceptance they would need to be an order of magnitude better, which translates to roughly 1 fatal accident per year per 10^5 self driving cars. The current numbers for the US are 36000 fatalities and 250M cars.",1369209151

I've used FeedDemon and Reeder (and NetNewsWire before that) for so long I'm really used to low-latency feed UI. I think web UI can match that, but NewsBlur isn't quite there yet.<p>I also think the new design, while much better than the old design, is still quite heavy, in the sense that there is a lot to take in, lots of little details. Personally, I really liked the more sparing design in for example Reeder for the Mac. It would be great if there was an option in the NewsBlur UI to point to a stylesheet (or an inline <style> block) that would allow me to play with customization a bit.<p>Of course, I also haven't found anything better so far, so it looks like NewsBlur will still be my reader of choice for the foreseeable future.",1369209138

But that wouldn't stop a politician from promising all of the above. :-)<p>That said, we did find broad agreement on many things that are completely off the political map in the USA.  For example we could reduce the size of our military, liberalize drugs, get rid of the DEA, and reduce prison populations.  All of that saves money.  We also agreed that none of us actually expect Social Security to still exist when we need it, and so we'd prefer it replaced in the long run by something out of the hands of the politicians.  Something along the lines of Australia's Superannuation would make sense.  (But it wouldn't be fair to do it like Bush suggested - where it is privatized but with cutoffs that massively reduce what people can expect to get.)<p>Absolutely none of that is in the public discourse.  But it would have been more popular in that office than anything being offered by the political parties.<p>In other conversations we also agreed that in general it is better to make rules simple and clear with the right incentives, rather than trying to add rules and counter rules that are guaranteed to give perverse incentives and a field day for lobbyists.  For example we have laws mandating fuel efficiency standards, with complex exceptions saying that different types of vehicles get different treatment.  I can't say anything about the net result other than that I'm sure that it lets politicians say that they solved the problem, while giving established Detroit companies some benefit.  (The most obvious candidate for a benefit is that the regulatory mess is a barrier to entry for competitors.)  But if you simply tax carbon fuels steeply enough, then incentives will be right.  And then if you redistribute those taxes back to people in direct payments, then people can afford the taxes, and are left pushed to choose efficient vehicles for economic reasons.",1369207844

5749346,comment,5748778,5749188,10,0,drawkbox,,,"Agreed.  Working in games you really do get to work with smart people, yet with the power of C++ everyone wants to recreate their own String class, data structures etc.  Game industry largely hates STL. There is also a distain for boost, another large collective of reviewed and hardened standard libraries (POCO is another nice one).  The ego is immense at places like this. Programmers feel like they have to do this to compete or deliver over shipping and delivering products that work. Granted there are reasons for doing this such as keeping memory allocations through a common engine library to reduce memory and fragmentation but in most cases it is a moot point.<p>Performance does mean the most many times in this field for the AAA games out there, but not for most games. In web or app development if you are using custom data structures instead of native, in most cases that is wrong. How about consistent data structures that have been built and tested outside the company? The thing is though when the programmer that makes your 5th string class and data structures moves on it will be rehashed by the next, as other developers won't be as effective with them and recreate.<p>It is much more important to understand what data structures to use when and what impact they have on performance. Most of all can the developer ship and understand what is best for the product (not the ego or what will make them look like the hardest programmer of all time -- i.e. Rewriting the string class again and it is 10% faster, even though that is not a problem at all). I have seen some horrible, leaky, buggy data structures in situations like this, because they thought that was the job as led on by the interviewing. I have only really seen this while working in the game industry which I love but it is a problem with shipping product when this bike shedding happens over improvements to the game, engine or real custom needs i.e. the UI libs, event/messaging systems, naming/conventions are typically horrible in situations like this.<p>I also blame consoles for many of these problems as the libs are so jacked, incomplete and old that performance becomes a huge issue and you have to have custom structures just to use the hardware right especially in graphics, physics + networking libs.  Yet mobile I have seen less of this problem even though there is less hardware to work with. The next time you play a game and the networking totally sucks, or a game takes forever or simply doesn't ship, understand the culture of the company and the industry might have something to do with it.",1369207310

Do you expect them to find two days of absence from their present employer to test themselves at your company?<p>I mean for me that's no problem, but I don't live in the US and therefore have pretty liberal employee leave arrangements. I know that many companies in the US are a lot harder on giving out leave. That said, it wouldn't surprise me if this issue is minimised in the tech sector with their progressive business approaches.",1369206130

5749292,comment,5748924,5748924,2,0,robomartin,,,"From my vantage point the utility of self driving cars is in highway driving.  I don't really care for auto city driving.<p>In that context perhaps the problem is somewhat simpler if one assumes the infrastructure will be modified to help these cars.  A lot could be done if each car communicated with roadside beacons and other locating systems. Some will voice concerns about privacy. I couldn't care less.  Your movements are already far more traceable than they were fifty or a hundred years ago.<p>If I could manually get on the Golden State; engage auto pilot and be alerted a couple of miles before my exit in San Jose I'd be thrilled.  I wouldn't even care if the thing pinged me every 15 minutes to see if I am awake.",1369206027

This will limit the useful range of such cars, but imagine manhattan decked out in these things and taxis or busses that only work in Manhattan. Could still have huge savings, especially if combined with computer vision as a fallback.<p>Edit: To be honestly my idea's probably not worth pursuing. I fully expect the cost of LIDARs to come down drastically in the next five years.",1369206024

Harder than aluminium, sure, but not anywhere close to hardened steel.<p>Titanium can be heat treated to an extent it doesn't gain that much. Also you really need a furnace for that kind of temperatures.<p>You need coolant if you use high cutting speeds, it also helps to remove swarf. It's still possible to machine titanium dry with appropriately formed cutter and get a fine surface.<p>(Source: I also turned two titanium rings)",1369206014

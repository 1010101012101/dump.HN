I've tried treating it with drugs, sticking to routines, exercise, meditation, diet, controlled lighting, and quite a few other methods. Eventually, I just stopped looking at it as a problem. I sleep about 5 to 6 hours a night now and I feel great. I just accepted I don't have the same sleep patterns as everyone else and moved on with my life. I've read about reaction times and how sleep affects cognition but I really don't believe it, <i>for me</i>. I've tested performance by going shooting and recording scores after various amounts of sleep and found that after more than 7 hours of sleep a night I get worse scores.<p>Science is averages, you might be average or you might not. Test your own performance and find out what you need. If you only need a few hours sleep and your performance is not affected, do that. Many people with insomnia worry about it or try to fix what might not be broken. You might be an outlier and not the average.",1324259916

Ready for it?  1 to 2 per month. 2 per month would be generous.  I'm not the type to block ads either (at least, not currently).<p>I'm a typical advertising network's worst nightmare.  I click on virtually nothing that someone is trying to push on me.  I rely on curated advertisements that... often aren't advertisements.  For example, blogs and tweets from very trusted sources.  Advertising networks like The Deck have a <i>better</i> hit rate, but, not amazingly so.<p>On top of that, while my conversion rate is high, the amount of things I buy overall is rather small.  What I buy is exactly what I want (or I think I want), and nothing but.  Random noise almost never sways my opinion.

I'd vote for them.""</i><p>Get to know the people who are running. By law they are contactable (Election Commission rules) and by design they care about you voting for them. So take a moment this round of elections and personally talk to everyone you can who is running. Really, its not that hard. If you put the sweetener in that you've got your $100 donation to the campaign of the person you find acceptable, its even easier.<p>It is very important to note that ""almost nothing"" is not ""nothing."" The tea party has had a disproportionate effect on the republican party votes because they are enough to swing votes one way or the other. The 'career' politicians give every impression of hating them (from both parties).<p>Personally I find the tea party 'line' way more conservative than I like but I massively respect that they chose to volunteer for serving the public.<p><i>""But sadly the way things are setup to work guarantees I pretty much get two equally bad choices.""</i><p>This misplaces the blame and that is why it doesn't get 'fixed'. It is <i>not</i> 'the way things are setup', it is the <i>participation</i> of the electorate (or lack thereof) which currently creates the situation you dislike so strongly. A majority of elections for Congress in 2010 were decided by significantly less than half the number of people who didn't vote. Think about that for a minute. The people not voting are screwing up the country. They have been 'trained' to not vote by stories and folks who would rather they not realize that their not voting gives folks who want to run the system power.<p>Talk to people running for office.<p>Vote for the one that isn't corrupt.<p>Get at least two and as many as you can of your non-voting neighbors and friends to vote.<p>You will help change the world, I guarantee it.",1324259268

3368104,comment,3367952,3367952,1,0,glimcat,,,"I've explored this idea before. There are a few problems, although not necessarily fatal ones. Major categories are engineering and sales.<p>Engineering, you have to build the thing. The best solution I found was bistable mechanical relays. A solid-state approach will have limited current handling and a lot of waste heat, while a monostable relay will consume power continuously in one state. The catch is that the fabrication cost is nontrivial. You'll also want some various things like current meters and a programmable controller. You also need to pay close attention to usability and ensuring that it behaves intuitively. Safety needs to be adequately addressed, probably including certifications despite the significant time and cost.<p>The key sales obstacle is that the end result is going to be expensive compared to a passive power strip. You'll want to constrain the fabrication cost as much as possible while still affording the most important features. It may be worthwhile to go with basic and premium versions, although this significantly increases your development, certification, and production costs.<p>I haven't had the time or capital to do this, but I'd be glad to see you pull it off.

Higher clock rate, more heat is generated, heat can't get out of the chip fast enough so chip temperature rises, transistors fail.<p>Leakage current, that is to say the current that flows through transistors because they cannot be fully turned 'off' is a sort of power 'floor.' If you use the 'water flowing' model of heat transfer (its not useful for simulation but it can explain behaviors) the leakage current results in a fixed amount of heat being dumped into the chip.  Active power dissipation gets added to that and the combination is the total power created. Chip designers build systems to transfer that heat into an ambient cooling fluid (typically air) and away from the chip. You can do that by blowing air over a large surface area (as room temperature air goes by, it becomes warmer and the heat sink becomes cooler).<p>The transistors have always been small enough for 'weird quantum effects' the most well known is quantum tunneling of electrons into the gate area. Those effects are known and designed around but so far have not prevented the shrinkage of transistors (increasing the areal density of same).",1324258449

In a (tiny) nutshell, our best answer for general images and objects is:<p>1) Instead of using the full color pixel image, use an ""edge image"" with some simple additional normalizations. If color is important, do this per color channel.<p>2) Create a dataset with as many cropped examples of the target object as you can find (mechanical turk is useful for annotating large datasets); every other crop of every image is a negative example.<p>3) Train a classifier (SVM if you want it to work, neural network if you're so inclined) using this dataset.<p>4) Apply the classifier to all subwindows of a new image to generate hypotheses of the target object location. This can be sped up in various ways, but this is the basic idea.<p>5) Post-process the hypotheses using context (can be as simple as simply finding the most confident hypotheses within a neighborhood).<p>If you're interested in object detection, an excellent recent summary of the recent decade of research is due to Kristen Grauman and Bastian Leibe: <a href=""http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00332ED1V01Y201103AIM011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00332ED1V01Y2...</a> (do some googling if you don't have access to this particular PDF).<p>A cool paper from a few months ago that should be mentioned when commenting on a post called ""Where's Waldo?"" is <a href=""http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rahul/data/WheresWaldo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/rahul/data/WheresWaldo.ht...</a>",1324257689

I think this was developed out of some big idea to try to gain favour with the MAFIAA, and I'd be very surprised if YouTube was in fact required by any law to develop a tool that makes it convenient for rights holders to pull content.<p>I think I see where the misunderstanding came from here.  I never meant to say that the DMCA explicitly said they have to provide a tool for ease of use, what I meant is that given the volume of requests they likely deal with the only economical option is to automate the process somehow. I don't agree with the decision, I don't know if I would make the same one, but given the volume and mandatory time-frame I don't think there are many other acceptable scenarios.<p>With regard to your anecdote, it sounds to me like the volume of take-down requests you deal with is manageable by a group of one or more people, I'm just saying I don't think throwing a group of people at the volume of requests YouTube gets would be enough to meet the safe-harbor time-frame and we both know they will do whatever it takes to get indemnity.",1324257290

However, if one does it without at all acknowledging the massive problem that feminism has been addressing then it looks a lot like a tactic to prevent any serious discussion of male privilege.</i><p>In the context of sexy females in comic books.  Give me a fucking break.<p><i>Which is something feminists have had to deal with for more than a hundred years, so it's not surprising they react poorly to it.</i><p>If this is the topic feminism must now address, the war is over.  It's time to pack up your shit and go home.  Feminists are starting to look like Genghis Khan, riding around slaughtering everything.  Especially when there are massive <i>actual</i> gender inequalities <i>caused by feminism</i> like the huge advantages that women have in the legal system, the fact that women are given preferential treatment in college admission and hiring processes, and the fact that women earn more money for equal work.  Or for example, that female owned businesses are given price preferences, or that women now vastly outnumber men as college graduates, while dominating the education system that is failing men.<p><i>For all your bold talk of ""both sides of the coin"" I haven't seen you give the slightest hint that you even admit the problem or have considered its nature, let alone devoted any energy to solving things.</i><p>That's probably because I don't see this as a problem.  It is pathetic.  I have never read a comic book and have never been in a comic book store, but I see no fundamental difference between comic books and magazines for teenage girls.  They are both full of fantasy-land bullshit designed to appeal to young people going through puberty.<p>What can I do to solve things?  I don't know.  Perhaps start fighting for men to be able to have financial abortions before a child is born.  Or maybe make it a felony to commit paternity fraud.  But probably just start calling feminists on their bullshit when they start pontificating.<p>If you feel there is a market for female-centric comic books, why not develop them, tap a huge market, make something women want, and get rich?

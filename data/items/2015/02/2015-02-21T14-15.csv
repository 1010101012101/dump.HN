Both USA and Russia are interested in limiting Chinese influence in South East Asia, and assisting India is a natural way to do so.<p>Oh, also, you should probably think through what the actual goal of foreign support is. Aside from short term humanitarian aid, the stated goal of these funds is to allow systemic uplift. The actual goal is more likely to combination of domestic feel goodism, and permanently crippling the recipient country&#x27;s ability to uplift on their own will.",1424530720

It&#x27;s basically saying that many cancers are not necessarily influenced by external factors and can be predicted by nothing more than the number of cell divisions and the probability of DNA mutation compounded.<p>That, in itself, is a <i>fascinating</i> scientific result. Arguing against the statistics here is probably not a good idea, unless there was a serious error in the math or an order of magnitude error in the probability of mutation. Certainly there are other possibilities of error in the data or methodology.<p>But the article in opposition (OP) is doing something odd that doesn&#x27;t appear to be a scientific argument: it&#x27;s railing against the language and the implications of the very concept of statistical analysis applied to the problem. It&#x27;s assuming that because we discovered that, perhaps, cancer has a certain probability of occurring independent of external factors, that it will somehow slow research or cause us to throw up our hands and give up on prevention strategies or research.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case. Rather than understanding the absolutely fascinating statistical analysis here, the OP article comes across as reactionary and unscientific.<p>Assuming the data is sound, the statistical analysis is profound. Most often, statistics such as that are profoundly misunderstood as well: people have an incredible capacity for attribution bias and data disbelief.

Compare Sargon, who took his throne about 500 years prior, or Narmer, who unified Egypt over a thousand years before Hammurabi was born. And we only know about them because they left records. The Egyptians also left records of various near-eastern peoples who clearly had flourishing civilizations at the time, but left no records of themselves. These great conquerors come from a backdrop of states that are already old.<p>Seven thousand years ago, pre-Egyptian nomads left religious art in what is now the Sahara desert (though at the time they used it to pasture their animals). Nomads aren&#x27;t traditionally considered civilized; we like to use agriculture as the threshold.

That&#x27;s why most Facebook/Instagram stores in Thailand always have at least 2-3 bank accounts for the buyer to pay to, each from different banks. Inter-bank transfer cost from 25 THB to 35 THB (about $1) depends on bank and amount while same-bank transfer is free.<p>This fact plus how hard it is to get payment processor to talk to you is really hurting the credit card adoption rate, despite acquiring a card is very easy here in Thailand (I have 5, 3 of which they ask me to have one). For example, K-Bank Payment Gateway requires you to sign lengthy documentation and need to pay them 200,000 THB ($6,500) as a reserve fund and still require redirection to the bank website to make payments (with 3DS, success auth callbacks and all.)<p>Using PayPal is possible, but transferring money from PayPal to bank account here still isn&#x27;t very straightforward. It involves either cheque, or routing the money through BBL NYK, each with its own set of fees. I&#x27;m not sure if this has changed because it has been a while since I used PayPal to accept payments, but for social network merchant it is still a hassle.<p>In Thailand (and Vietnam) there is <a href=""http://get.page365.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://get.page365.net/</a> who tries to tackle this problem about managing social network stores and payments. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of their successful stories, which may implies there&#x27;s still a lot of opportunities in this market. (Disclosure: one of their founder is my close friend.)",1424527944

9085539,comment,9085429,9085429,0,0,11thEarlOfMar,,,"The assimilation, via evolution, of tools as an extension of our physiology is pretty easy to contemplate and understand. Not so straightforward is the evolution of emotions. I believe that love, anger, awe, longing, etc. are not learned emotional responses. They are also passed via DNA and therefore, evolved attributes. If one accepts that our emotions are evolved and that, for us, evolution has been suspended by our use of technology (basically since adoption of agriculture), then our emotional response patterns are the same as our prehistoric ancestors. But the inputs that drive those response patterns are not.<p>This is a weighty discontinuity, since we are not living in a prehistoric world. Considering this discontinuity helps a great deal in understanding the, many times, illogical behaviors of myself and others. Take the affinity for team sports, for example. It is a huge business, but why? I&#x27;ve spent many Sunday afternoons screaming at the TV as the quarterback throws yet another interception. Why do I get so worked up? Why do I react so much like I am participating in the team&#x27;s successes and failures?<p>My theory is that, emotionally, being part of a team of people that accomplishes tasks that individuals could not accomplish is key to my survival. With a team, I can take down a mastodon, kill a marauding saber tooth tiger, fight off enemy clans. Alone I&#x27;d have little chance. So evolution selected for teaming behaviors by using emotions to provide both the reward (elation when the team succeeds) and punishment (despair when it fails). Couple that with the need to belong to a group of people (loneliness if I don&#x27;t), and you have &#x27;fanatics&#x27; or &#x27;fans&#x27;.<p>There are many such thought experiments. So when I get some free time (ha, ha) I want to take a course in evolutionary psychology:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology</a>",1424527758

It remembers my login better than websites do (probably a security risk, but my phone&#x27;s encrypted), it integrates photo-taking direct into the app which is handy for selling and buying e.g. buying: if you have a minor dispute with a seller you can just blast off a photo in the built-in messaging system. It sends notifications for watched items. The UI is also better than the mobile site - the click targets are nice and big and the lists scroll quickly - but that could possibly be improved in the site. The native integration is mostly what makes it nice.",1424527531

I get to talk with nice people, maybe learn something, etc. Afterwards, I tell my friends that they should try to work there.<p>The pre-interview part of the job search for companies that don&#x27;t use outside recruiters leaves something to be desired.<p>Advice for companies trying to hire:<p>1) Remember that you will probably be hiring again - don&#x27;t piss off your future applicant pool because you don&#x27;t need them for your <i>current</i> position. Treat them how you would like to be treated i.e. communicate with them even if it is automated.<p>2) Post a salary range - If you want to know what range applicants are looking for &quot;so we don&#x27;t waste your time&quot;. Post a range, problem solved. Oh, posting a range will upset your current employees? Maybe you should pay your current developers at the market rate.<p>3) Do the work. I realize that making candidates jump through arbitrary hoops is an easy way to limit the number of resume&#x27;s your hiring team has to look at but don&#x27;t be surprised if the best candidates go to companies that actually put in the work (read the cover letters, look at the portfolios, talk to the candidates, etc).<p>I would love to know how long a position has been open. I&#x27;ve seen job ads running for months, possibly years. Obviously this wouldn&#x27;t be in the interest of the hiring companies. For a job searcher it would be a way to weed out the companies that aren&#x27;t going to hire anyone.",1424527308

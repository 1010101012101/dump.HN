With no one looking, ads on your site have no value.<p>There have been a half dozen other ""hackers find co-founders"" sites spawned here at HN, and so far all have been free...and <i>they</i> haven't really gone anywhere (though there may have been some traction gained since I last looked).  I'll be absolutely stunned if a pay site like this goes anywhere.  If it is to go anywhere, you need to get your biz dev down to a science...and it needs to be what you're doing every single day.",1236844386

Unless there's a credible threat people will go to another engine for natural results, for Google to degrade their own natural results slightly can improve Google's quarterly revenues!<p>Let's say Google is A/B testing a ranking tweak. Option A results in more searches (because people don't find exactly what they're looking for on the first try), and more clicks on ads (because they look relatively better). Option B results in one click on a natural result and nothing further.<p>Are we sure they'll always choose option B?<p>Maybe Google can add a new advanced operator: [-src:googlesyndication.com]. That is, don't return results that 'source' (as in <SCRIPT SRC="""">) Google ad units.<p>I won't hold my breath.",1236844366

Sorry you think it had zero value.<p>For what it's worth, I never said nor meant to imply that I thought the website of the lady who wanted a job with Twitter isn't suitable for HN, though I don't find it to be exemplary. It's a whole lot more on target than (as previously stated) articles on macroeconomics, politics, or flirting.<p>None of this is to say that I actually disagree with your point on the silly nature of what garners karma and what collects down-mods, but that is a topic for another time.",1236843710
513165,comment,511888,511888,0,0,MartinKleppmann,,,"I'm developing a free Ruby Gem called Invoicing -- <a href=""http://ept.github.com/invoicing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ept.github.com/invoicing/</a> -- it basically provides a miniature accounting and invoicing system inside your app, it's very powerful (flexible tax handling, multi-currency, support for resellers/affiliates) but easy to get started with too. At the moment it doesn't include particular payment method implementations out of the box, but I want to start including those soon. I am also working on integrating it with OAccounts <a href=""http://oaccounts.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oaccounts.org/</a> -- a (work-in-progress) open standard for exchanging financial data between different accounting systems.<p>The important thing is though that with the invoicing gem, you end up representing the data in an accountant-friendly structure, without having to think like an accountant. And that makes things a hell of a lot easier when you start scaling the business and need to know what's going on in your accounts for tax, legal and management reasons. Just taking payments won't do; you also need to know who is paying for what, keep statements of accounts etc. If you're a business in the EU, selling to another EU country, tax is different from selling within your own country. And so on.<p>Would love to hear your opinions on the Invoicing Gem; I agree that a standard framework is needed, and this is my attempt to contribute one to the community.",1236843594
513164,comment,512801,513062,0,0,fhars,,,"Actually, no. These tag bits are usually stored in the lowest bits which are zero for all pointers (you would be mad not to align your data structurs to the four or eight byte boundaries your hardware uses for memory access). So you get the full width for pointers, but reduced width for your fixnums, because you have to set one of the least significant bits of the machine word to one to distinguish it from a pointer.
That you still can't use the full 4GB of a 32 Bit address space is due to the fact that the OS needs some address space for itself, the details of this vary from OS to OS and what the runtime of your language does with the addresses the OS allows it to use. So beeing able to use more than 2GB on a 32 bit architecture should not be taken for granted.",1236843497

I tried to download Daemon Tools to mount a linux iso, but Daemon Tools isn't compatible with Windows 7 beta. Other than that, no problems with hardware or software compatibility.<p>And I installed it when I was putting in a clean hard drive in my laptop and was basically choosing between the iso's on

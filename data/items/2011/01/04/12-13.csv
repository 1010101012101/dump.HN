For these functions, we use floats because it is a rigid body sampling and is very tolerant to clashes.

2066748,comment,2066552,2066552,0,0,korl,,,"Whatever, idiocracy-like event occurred thousands of years ago, I think the one happening now will dwarf it. At least in most western countries and Japan where successful people have less children. It's almost like an anti survival of the fittest, if you are successful, less people in the next generation will carry your genes.<p>Brain size might or might not be related to intelligence. In any case, this is what Wikipedia has to say ""In general, these studies have reported that East Asians have on average a larger brain size than whites who have on average a larger brain size than blacks.""[1]<p>If you ignore who is having children among whites (successful people or not), you still have the white population rapidly declining with a birth rate below replacement levels, I believe that this coupled with mass immigration and the high birth rates of immigrants, specially in Europe, in addition to race mixing in other places like the US, will ensure that brain size in these places decreases at a fast rate. Unless we have mass immigration from East Asian countries, like Vietnam.<p>In the ""racist"" comment above, I didn't lie, I didn't insult anybody and I didn't say that one race is more intelligent than the other. I agree that my opinion might not be politically correct.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence#Brain_size"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence#Brain_siz...</a>",1294145734

2066737,comment,2066066,2066066,0,0,dalke,,,"I've worked in molecular modeling, bioinformatics, cheminformatics, and related fields. My observation has been that a large percentage of the people in those fields start from the sciences and learn the software development. This likely reflects the length of time it takes to become productive in each field.<p>I don't do much with bioinformatics these days so can't give you much specifics, but Dan Gusfield at UC Davis is an example of someone who started from algorithms development and (I believe) with collaboration entered bioinformatics. Jim Kent, now at UCSC, was a professional programmer who developed GigAssembler to assemble the data for the public Human Genome Project. But he entered grad school and was working on a PhD in biology before doing that.<p>But in general there are a number of groups which have people with science and people with programming backgrounds working together, both in industry and academia. The research group I was in in grad school had PIs and students from the physics, chemistry, CS, and math departments. I've worked with a number of companies which have research groups with either direct IT support or they've hired their own software developers.<p>If you specifically want a company hire the two of you, which means paying two salaries, and there's no history of how well the two of you work together, then I think it's going to be hard to convince them. What's the advantage for them to hire a pair than to hire two people out of the general population, with equivalent backgrounds?",1294145455

If we don't, then passport will be stuck somewhere for months and months without coming out. Even for knowing why it is not getting processed, you have to pay bribe. So finally, everyone has stopped questioning and started giving money to agents to get the things done.<p>The problem is no one is responsible if the citizen is not getting the promised services. We cannot see the status about why it is pending online, we don't know whom to contact online, no helpdesks. You just have to go to the office and wait and wait for turn only to be turned away without even getting a chance to speak.<p>If one person is made responsible for citizen satisfaction for services and he is like the manager in the office whose compensation is dependent on the rating the citizen gives for the services, then I think this will change.<p>How to make government officials answerable to the people? \nThis is difficult, because a government is voted for a period of 5 yrs into power and they have 5 yrs to loot without doing anything and then bribe their way into power again. \nIf this vicious cycle can be broken by clear communication about the government performance, so clear that people can't ignore, then they may vote for another government which is not much better than this.

2066674,comment,2066095,2066338,0,0,silencio,,,"I feel like people just have this need to pile on and add their negative review to things when they see other people doing it. Or maybe out of spite in a public place, just because they feel they have no other recourse and must warn others about their problems.<p>I own some Vizio products I'm perfectly happy with that have never had issues to date (TV, bluray player). Some of their products are hit-or-miss in terms of what you pay for, but all companies have that thing going on with products here and there and that's what product reviews are for. The one time I contacted support to figure out how to get wifi working on my bluray player because I couldn't find the settings, I felt like I had an average experience and my problem was solved. But overall, I really think that it's the value Vizio gives you that makes it worthwhile. Their products are never exceptional in any other way.<p>I bought a Samsung LED HDTV a few months ago that was reasonably priced and looked nice, but has some ""features"" that annoy me to no end to the point that I almost feel ripped off because my TV was advertised as being able to do something and I really didn't consider it functional (<i>especially</i> those damn apps and the app ""store""). Whenever I ran into a roadblock, I couldn't even find a support page (apparently my TV model was too new) and support was very unhelpful. I don't hate it enough to seek out venues to vent and I didn't hate it enough to return it (all TVs seem to have this problem to me), but I will bring it up should it ever come up in conversation anywhere. I bought this TV to replace a Sony plasma that stopped turning on, but it was out of warranty so I couldn't expect miracles there.<p>My Logitech Harmony remote and Apple TV are so awesome I have written gushing reviews and have recommended both to at least two dozen family members and friends during this past month. I will go out of my way to say a good word about these devices that I honestly don't think I can use a TV without.<p>I guess my point is, Vizio isn't really in the market to sell exceptional products, so people either remember it as 'oh, whatever' or have some real big gripe and typically the product will be out of warranty at that point or it was the user's fault and... basically, just take it with a grain of salt. If anyone was objecting to Vizio based on their trade and labor practices, fine, but a row of bad comments months after the story is published is lame :(",1294143404

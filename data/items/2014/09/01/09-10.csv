I&#x27;ve been running a Windows Phone for over a year now, and although I loved the OS, constant remarks regarding the app gap made me wonder if I was missing out on the full smartphone experience.<p>Thus I obtained a Samsung Galaxy and logged into my old Android account, eagerly anticipating all those exciting apps I&#x27;d soon have access to at my fingertips. Going thought the Play Store was a great experience - Instagram, SnapChat, Yo, etc. - I installed every hyped app like I was on a crazed shopping spree. This included apps that simply replicated a web experience, e.g. Amazon Shopping, Quora, and even Go Daddy (in case I ever wanted to check my domain renewal status while out and about!)<p>The first week or so was exciting, I was in thrall of all the things I <i>could</i> potentially do with my phone and how (by some unknown means) these apps would help me live my life. However as the weeks went on I found that even though I had all these apps, I simply didn&#x27;t use them. I realised that just having the technology available isn&#x27;t enough, you have to have a want and need for it.<p>From this experience I&#x27;ve recognised what I personally need from a smartphone. For me it&#x27;s about a good camera, music player, calendar, and a way to directly and privately communicate with my friends and family. Add to this a few key apps, covering transport/maps, gym, ebooks, podcasts, etc., and I&#x27;m good to go.<p>I now have a Nokia Lumia on its way to me in the post. I won&#x27;t have the latest hot apps, but that&#x27;s okay. And when the next big app does come around, hopefully at some point it will come to my platform, and if not I&#x27;ll happily just get on with my work.",1409563682

Not that bottom 20 wasn&#x27;t worth reading, but there is no limit to absorption if you don&#x27;t make one.<p>Second trick is &quot;Stay Focused&quot; Chrome extension. You can add there your favorite absorption sites and set time limit how much a day you can spend on them. After you use your daily quota it shows you &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t you be working page&quot;. Pro tip: change it for redirect to Google or your corporate page. You don&#x27;t want your boss seeing that page and having first thought: &quot;So, he hasn&#x27;t been working!&quot;. It makes worse impression than seeing you actually reading some tutorial.<p>For the procrastination enemies use Block Site Chrome extension to block them completely.<p>At the end, I think it&#x27;s ok to absorb reasonably in work. Your work is not repetitive manual job. Once in a while, you have to give your brain a rest to be productive. Unless it turns into procrastination (I bet it happens sometimes) I think HN widens your horizons.

When you delete a photo from an online site, it&#x27;s often the case that the photo is moved from its original folder to the &quot;deleted&quot; folder and stored there. This is how Google Drive works (using a folder named &quot;trash&quot;). Then, if you&#x27;re especially diligent, you can delete the contents of the &quot;deleted&quot; folder, in which case, and finally, the content is deleted.<p>> Isn&#x27;t that a severe accusation about iCloud services?!<p>Consider the alternative: &quot;I unintentionally deleted my magnum opus. Where did you put it?

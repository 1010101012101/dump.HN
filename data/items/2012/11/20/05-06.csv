I ask because I went to a top 5 undergrad but never did any research so I'm not attending a top 5 grad school.  However, I think the research I am doing now is possibly eye-catching, so how much does what-research vs. which-grad school matter?<p>(By the way, I actually like my grad school significantly more than my undergrad so ranking of course isn't everything).",1353391163

To make it relatable, you have to tie it into the elements of music-- for this, I use Copland's ""What to Listen for in Music"". Once students can generally grasp and talk specifically about Melody, Harmony, Rhythm, and Tone Color, you can relate the music theory to it.<p>I have about 200 6th-8th graders that are able to perform basic figured-bass analysis on major-key chorales in about 3-4 months by progressing in an orderly fashion from notation to rhythm to major scales to the Circle of Fifths to minor scales to intervals, to chords, and finally, to cadencial analysis. Some of them pretty much view it as a game we play with written notes, but, when reinforced by practical experience in private lessons or participation in ensembles, it is remarkable how much they <i>like</i> it and are sad when we move on to Music History in the second half of the year.",1353389308

Staging carpet for example, when you start carpeting its rolls and rolls and rolls of carpet, lifted by crane to various floors, and later cut to order.

So now, when I get the urge to spend on games, I try to remember to support indie gaming first.<p>I will mention that news of Nintendo's support for indie devs on the Wii U is an unexpected trend in the right direction. This probably puts them on part with the PS3 & Xbox 360: not great but better than nothing. While MSFT has XNA, the iOS and Android ecosystems are killing the outdated distribution & publishing models of the consoles. Hopefully this ends well for everyone.<p>---<p>[0]: PC & Mac being the least encumbered, iOS and Android with similar developer access but distribution control. Also see kickstarter projects like FTL, which rocked my socks off.",1353387734

I don't think PG addressed this in his essay, but I was wondering about the fear some startups have - whether their idea may be easily rolled into the product of an existing encumbent.<p>E.g. I read below someone's startup idea is for a new type of movie rating system (""because 5 stars just isn't good enough anymore"") - but couldn't this be easily wiped out if an encumbent like IMDB just rolled the idea directly into their rating system.",1353387691

The fastest production car today will do damn close to 100 mph more than that (Bugatti Veyron Super Sport).<p>Certainly the top speed of either of those cars isn't practical, but the reason that the Veyron can go so much faster is that there have been massive improvements in automobile technology since the 60s, in just about every every way imaginable.  Safety, efficiency, control, materials tech, aerodynamics, etc.   That we still drive so slowly can be probably attributed to momentum in automotive laws and/or driver skill / lax license requirements.  If we were willing to invest more in our roads and stop thinking of driving as a right instead of a privilege, we could be driving <i>much</i> faster today.",1353387677

4807803,comment,4804818,4807246,2,0,pirateking,,,"I don't believe that is true, you can use class_replaceMethod to dynamically swizzle methods at runtime. This gets rid of compiler error and warning messages that appear when just using categories to override existing methods. From my understanding, the compiler enforces compilation unit visibility for methods implemented in a category, but the methods actually are actually added to the global scope.<p>There is no ""top level"" object or class_eval in Objective-C, so the situation is quite different from Ruby.<p>Here is an interesting paper about classboxes[1] (same concept as refinements), and the source code for the Objective-C runtime[2]. I found them to be useful in my research.<p>[1] <a href=""http://rmod.lille.inria.fr/archives/papers/Berg05a-CompLangESUG04-classboxesJournal.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rmod.lille.inria.fr/archives/papers/Berg05a-CompLangE...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://opensource.apple.com/source/objc4/objc4-532.2/runtime/objc-runtime-new.mm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.apple.com/source/objc4/objc4-532.2/runtime...</a>",1353387663

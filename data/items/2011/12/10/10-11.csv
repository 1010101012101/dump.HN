That is, the frequency/intensity of interactions, especially facilitated by involuntary sharing, is beyond what the biological system can handle and the result may be maladaptive behaviors.<p>From Wikipedia:<p>""When forced interactions exceed some threshold, social norms break down. Thus social density is considered more critical than geometric spatial density.""",1323514774

Even though his prognosis was very bad, he got top notch care, got MRI/PET/CAT scans whenever they were needed, got put into an experimental chemo program, and generally received fantastic care. Although it wasn't enough, and from a financial POV was probably a Poor investment, I cannot in any way fault the care he received. There are certainly problems with the Canadian system, but every experience I've had with it (even and perhaps even especially the unsuccessful ones) has been fantastic.",1323514541

Then I learned how to execute using a very lightweight web app that I paid a consultant to build and hired people who were smart enough and trained them from scratch.  In 2 years I've gone from one person and $0 in cash to a business w/ great margins & nine people w/ all growth paid for by sales by focusing on a single idea and always holding onto it.  Pretty soon I'll be able to pay for the people I need to scale the business to much larger.<p>In my opinion calling ideas worthless shows a lack of vision and creativity.  It is very possible to engineer a business that can dominate from a single idea; doing so takes some fortitiude, cash, moxie, luck, strategy, determination, and a bunch of other adjectives.",1323512306

3337355,comment,3336656,3337061,10,0,ljf,,,"Thanks for sharing, similar story:<p>Here in the UK a program was started sending out postal tests for bowel cancer to men and women of an at risk age.<p>One arrived for my father, he wasn't going to bother, he felt fine, and to do the test you had to paste a bit of poo into the kit and post it back, which grossed him out a bit. My mother persueded him to do it, and 3 weeks later he was called up by the hospital, as they'd detected blood.<p>2 weeks later he was having internal test and a month after that had a tumour and a couple of feel of colon removed.<p>It's now 3 years later and thankfully the tumours have not returned, though he has 6 monthly check-ups until the 5 year mark, then down to yearly.<p>All this was free (well paid for by tax). By pre-emptively catching the cancer early the NHS was able to both save a mans life, and also save a huge amount of money that could have been spent on late stage care.<p>I am forever indebted to the NHS and universal health care. As a self employed artist my father wouldn't have been able to afford private care, and I hate to imagine the state of care he would have received in another country, where universal free healthcare did not exist or was underfunded. The money we pay here in tax is far less than that paid in other countries in insurance, and covers everyone equally.",1323512158

Granted, a lot of this influx has been in the software development industry, but I really don't think that it's much of a leap to assume that it will also flow into other industries - especially considering that it is flowing through general acceptance by the average person in society.<p>The optimistic part of me thinks that although it may have a bit of a rough transition, the next few generations after us will end up as being <i>very</i> open as far as accepting whatever behavior people indulge in with consenting parties.",1228154259

The open-source business model is broken.""<p>Yes, if you haven't heard that open source as a business strategy is broken, it's because you aren't paying attention.  Or perhaps the real reason you haven't heard that is because not many people are reaching this conclusion anymore after so many astonishing open source exits in the last year alone.<p>""This will require many to adopt a new mindset, viewing open source more as a means than an end in itself.""<p>Agreed, giving away software and source code for free does not directly translate into revenue.  Point scored for knocking straw man on his ass.<p>""The traditional open-source business model that relies solely on support and service revenue streams is failing to meet the expectations of investors.""<p>I think the only thing disappointing investors about open source business is missing out on opportunities like:<p>""Consider Sun MicroSystems' (JAVA) $1 billion acquisition of open-source database software vendor MySQL.""<p>Now I know it wouldn't have supported the position about how much open source business sucks, but it's worth mentioning some more examples here:<p>January 2008 - Nokia buys Trolltech for $150M<p>One from my own industry, open source network security:<p>March 2007 - Sourcefire raises $75M in IPO<p>I'm not sure exactly how many other software companies went public in 2007, but it wasn't very many.  5? 10?",1228154252

Unfortunately, now that I have the reputation of a business to worry about I have to be far more careful, but it's still not that big of a deal.<p>Life is about trade-offs. You trade some anonymity for some convenience or a useful service. Being anonymous on the Internet, in the sense of nobody knowing your true identity, hasn't really gotten any harder. Sign up for whatever you want, just don't use your real name.

I ran the IT and plant-floor systems operations for a now-defunct Ford plant (Dearborn Glass).  This was about 14 years ago, for reference sake.<p>As a sideline I was also building and selling PCs to various coworkers, including a lot of fairly high ranking UAW negotiators.  As such, I would go to their houses after hours to fix various user-inflicted issues, we would have a few beers and get to talking...  Let me just say that there was little room for ""management"" to negotiate in the grand scheme of things.  The majority of the demands by the UAW were completely unreasonable and unscalabe, and underneath it all they knew this.<p>Your first sentence is correct in that the UAW seeks only to increase its membership and payroll, but they go about this in a very non-beneficial parasitic arrangement.  I am not saying that management is/was all saints either... But when I had to almost physically drag a forklift operator away from a poker game to move something, or witness a guy whose sole purpose for being was to make sure the ""knobs"" (thing the rear view mirror attaches to) were properly installed on finished windshields (he managed to do this job while simultaneously reading the paper) something was clearly wrong.<p>The non-American automakers really had to make only 1 critical business decision: keep the UAW out of the factory.",1228153326

One example might be illegal drug use, which could have serious, trivial or non-existent repercussions depending on where you work and who you run with.

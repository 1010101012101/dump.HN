Others want to fix it over github or through open source.<p>The site was released this month, publicly.  Should we really analyze the site that quickly and only take the pessimistic view.  I know the site is a political football already, let&#x27;s not make snap decisions before even the month is up.<p>* I am curious how analysts got a hold of the code?  Is it closed source or open source.  If auditors were allowed in to look at the code, then  why not analyze the code over the life of the project and critically analyze it early on as opposed to weeks after release.<p>* If you don&#x27;t have access to the full repository of source, then how can you call the project a failure?  Who looks at snippets of JavaScript and then declare the project horrible.<p>* And why just this site?  I have heard of CGI and SAIC and QSSI.  There are many enterprise software firms out there that work with government contracts.  Why is suddenly this one abyssal failure?<p>* I feel that the customers of the site (whoever launched the contract with CGI/QSSI) should have the last input on how the site should be enhanced or fixed.   Random people on the Internet throwing out there suggestions can&#x27;t be healthy.  And I even wonder if Obama suggesting that he would talk with industry leaders was nothing more than politics.  The contract was not between &quot;industry leaders&quot; and the government.  Apparently the contract was awarded to CGI.

There&#x27;s nothing any hospital can do for you except sedate you until you&#x27;re dead.<p>What? We never had effective antivirals. We have a few useful drugs (oseltamivir, protease inhibitors, etc) for particular viruses, but there has never been a point in human history when rabies was a treatable disease. The Milwaukee protocol, which is the only effective[1] non-vaccine treatment for rabies, isn&#x27;t even drug-based!<p>You may of course be confused. The major antiviral used in replications of the Giese case, amantadine, was also an anti-flu drug, resistance to which is now widespread <i>in influenza</i> (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amantadine#Veterinary_misuse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amantadine#Veterinary_misuse</a> ). However, I do not believe amantadine resistance has ever been described in rabies, which in any case is usually treated with vaccination -- the challenge is to get the immune system to respond to the virus before the host dies! Giese herself was treated with both amantadine and ribavirin. In any case, your claim is confusing at best, misleading at worst.<p>[1]: controversial, see <a href=""http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/712839_7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/712839_7</a>",1382585463

I couldn&#x27;t find a source for the 3.5 to 7 kWh figure, and their are a lot of ways it could be wrong or misleading.  Firstly, you don&#x27;t refine gasoline in a vacuum; when you refine a barrel of oil, you get roughly 45 gallons of refined petroleum products, including about 19 gallons of gasoline.  Are they assigning the full cost to the gasoline, dividing it by volume, or by energy cost?  And 3.5 vs 7.5 is a full factor of two.  What is the average cost?<p>Even taking the energy cost as gospel, it still tells you a heckuva lot more about the vehicles than the fuel.  ICEs peak at about 30% efficiency, so you ought to be able to apply a solid 12 kWh from a gallon of gas to making cars go.  If the fifty miles you can push a particular electric car on 7.5 kWh is more than your typical car, that&#x27;s hardly the fuel&#x27;s fault.  And indeed: the current record for fuel efficiency is 209 mpg.<p>So it&#x27;s duplicitous to say that electricity is more efficient for running cars than gasoline, or claim gasoline is somehow energy negative.  We get so much energy from gasoline we can be extraordinarily wasteful in how we use it.",1382585455

6603256,comment,6567261,6574805,1,0,jimzvz,,,"You are describing the processes in our universe that allow the existence of the created universe. From within that universe, the actors would have no knowledge of these processes or even the existence of our universe unless the creators explicitly provided them with this information. To them, their universe would appear to be everything in existence just as ours does to us. That is why, to me, these universes are analogous to our own and since they are the only universes we know to exist besides our own (even though they exist within our universe), I think it makes sense to consider the possibility that our universe is no different and that our universe may exist within a parent universe and that our universe has a creator in the parent universe just as our child universes have creators in ours.<p>As far as evidence goes, there is no tangible evidence (and if the theory is correct, it would probably be impossible to get evidence unless the creator allowed it) but if you have 100 bags and in 99 of those bags there is an egg, it can be reasonable to assume that there is an egg in the 100th bag. That isn&#x27;t really evidence though especially because that 100th bag is different from the other 99 as it contains them. It could be argued however, that this is is a type of evidence. I&#x27;m not sure how exactly but I think someone smarter than me could.<p>Regarding scale, I don&#x27;t think that that is such an issue for three reasons:<p>1) If something is contained in something else, it is reasonable that it&#x27;s container is larger so just as our universe is on a larger scale than our child universes, our parent universe could be on a larger scale to our own.<p>2) Only the actors and what they observe need to be simulated (I may be the only actor, maybe it&#x27;s you) the rest can be approximated. Perhaps this is why it is so difficult for scientists to come up with a unified theory. Maybe macro and micro events within our universe are simulated in different ways and the simulator that runs our universe is inconstant when these two simulations need to be merged.<p>3) Perhaps it takes the equivalent of years in our parent universe to simulate a second in our universe maybe this very moment is the only one that has been simulated and the past is just the initial state.<p>edit: The bag/egg analogy isn&#x27;t great but I am sure that you know what I mean.",1382585249

But I think neither statement is totally satisfying, and the more interesting question is why different languages settled on different encodings for strings in RAM.<p>Microsoft had reasons to pick UTF-16 for C# and the CLR. The Windows API speaks UTF-16, and when C# was first announced way back in 2000, UTF-8 was not yet a widely used encoding on the Web; Unicode was sadly not that widely used on the Web, period. The decision to use 16-bit Unicode in the Win32 API went even further back, to the development leading up to NT 3.1&#x27;s release in July 1993. At that point, UTF-8 was a relative baby; it was presented at USENIX in January 1993. Also, back then, code points basically <i>were</i> 16 bits because surrogate pairs were but a twinkle in the Unicode Consortium&#x27;s eye. The Unicode 2.0 standard added surrogate pairs to help them expand their CJK selection and generally let them add more chars of all sorts; it wasn&#x27;t released until 1996. Now here we are and we have , U+1F603.<p>Go came along in 2009; by then, many Web sites were being served in UTF-8, and Go&#x27;d be used in significant part in Web operations, and UTF-8 was also the default encoding in many Unix environments. Go initially didn&#x27;t run on Windows at all and was ported by the community, so fitting in with Win32 wasn&#x27;t an issue. Code points that wouldn&#x27;t fit in 16 bits were a fact of life by &#x27;09, too. Arguments about inherent merits of encodings aside, it probably would have seemed to lots of folks that UTF-8 was a natural choice for that task at that time.<p>Also, Pike and Thompson are two of the three co-designers of Go and co-designed UTF-8, and UTF-8 was the encoding used by the Plan 9 OS/environment they built at Bell Labs, so, again, technical details aside, it was kind of a foregone conclusion which encoding they&#x27;d build the language around. :)<p>The one thing I do <i>not</i> want to do here is get in an argument about the inherent merits of character encodings, so I&#x27;m just not gonna do that. :)<p>On UTF-16 and Windows NT: <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/99884"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/99884</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_3.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_3.1</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode</a><p>On Unicode adoption on the Web, UTF-8, and Plan 9: <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/unicode-over-60-percent-of-web.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/unicode-over-60-perce...</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs</a>",1382585216

This ability is limited by the range of a cars sensors and by the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of a complex situation. &#x27;Maybe the driver is completely distracted,&#x27; Werner Huber said. &#x27;He takes five, six, seven seconds to come back to the driving taskthat means the car has to know [in advance] when its limitation is reached. The challenge is very big.&#x27;&quot;<p>My dream is the dream of fully door-to-door driverless cars. I think the article &quot;Why Driverless Cars Are Inevitable--and a Good Thing&quot;<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390443524904577651552635911824"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000087239639044352490...</a><p>by Dan Neil of the Wall Street Journal, published last year, is a good commentary on why ordinary people will mostly be glad to use driverless cars, and regulators and insurers will be glad to nudge drivers to use them. But that&#x27;s only if they work, and it&#x27;s not clear how soon driverless cars will work reliably and be manufactured inexpensively enough to become routine on our streets and roads.",1382584793

It was not taken seriously as an application platform. None of the built-in apps used it, never mind it being the basis for system programming. Android is a Java OS in a more meaningful way than running a CLR for some subclass of apps, which certainly doesn&#x27;t make Windows a &quot;C# OS.&quot;<p>Try writing a non-game Android application with every Activity component as a NativeActivity subclass.

Prior to Android being released, I was working on wireless device OS that used Linux and a Java VM for userland software. I am very familiar with the performance increment obtainable using a JIT in a mobile device, and, as an alternative, in using a precompiled Java runtime. As in Android, the heavy-duty pixel-pushing in that OS was done in a graphics stack implemented in native code. Much of Android&#x27;s widget set is also in native code.

385580,comment,385403,385558,0,0,jwilliams,,,"Def a good idea to completely cycle your battery every now and then (i.e. use till your laptop totally runs out of juice and then totally charge again).<p>Battery chemistries have improved since the old NiCad days, but they will still exhibit some memory.<p>Also, batteries tend to have a lot of smarts in them nowadays - cycling the battery will let the electronics have a better idea of when the battery is actually full or empty. This will result in a better charge when you use the battery for real.<p>Afaik, that last point is why Apple recommend power cycling your battery every now and then.",1228391928

385575,comment,385400,385512,0,0,dazzawazza,,,"I think everyone who uses Python seriously understands that the 'break', while annoying, is necessary to create a better language.<p>No one really expects 2.6 to be abandoned any time soon (within the next 3 years or so) so there is plenty of time for projects you are dependant on to move over to 3.0.<p>I think the difference between PHP and Python is that the Python community is smaller and less antagonistic toward it's '(benevolent) dictator'.<p>I'm guessing a key difference is that most people (IMHO) that use python are programmers and understand that a little pain now is preferable to a dead language. A lot of PHP users aren't programmers. They are people who admin a PHPBB and for them it was just a huge PITA researching what worked and didn't between PHP4 and 5.<p>Of the 30 or so python packages that my work is dependant on none of them are moving to 3.0 solely and most of them haven't finished moving to 2.6 yet. They all support python 2.4+ I'm really not worried (I am aware that that statement could bite me in the arse within the next year :).",1228391486

Lysenkoism being the prime example.<p>Also how would any research done now rehabilitate Lamarck? He had no evidence for his hypothesis and his theory was incredibly vague.

385572,comment,385392,385392,0,0,neilk,,,"I'm a bit disappointed in all this ""bah humbug, I can manage my credit cards"" attitude.<p>That site is specifically for people who are struggling to manage their finances. I'm not really sold that their reasons for not accepting credit cards make sense (lack of fraud protection is the biggest problem). But it makes some psychological sense. You don't see a lot of AA meetings held in bars.<p>Also, complaining that the average yokel can't manage their credit is like complaining that users can't deal with a command-line interface. Sure the discipline to learn it would pay off, but most people aren't wired that way. Furthermore the credit system as we have it now is designed, by very talented professionals, to prey on common flaws in the human mammal's ability to assess risk and future obligation.<p>Everybody has something that they're irrational about. Don't make me ask you how much time you've spent on WoW this month.<p>Lastly, those of us on this board are probably lucky to have relatively high-paying jobs, even if we were less-than-perfect students or tried startup life for a while. The demand is just that great. But software is a huge anomaly in the North American economy. Wages for most people have been flat, relative to inflation, for decades. And furthermore, the risk of sudden and prolonged drops in income has been much higher since 1970 or so. For hackers that means <i>okay, okay, I'll take the stupid J2EE job</i>. For the average North American worker, it might mean accepting some stupid low wage service job.<p>Anyway, the point is, most families have been making up the difference with credit cards. They're not living extravagantly and still they're falling behind. See this lecture by Elizabeth Warren, ""The Coming Collapse of the Middle Class"". (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akVL7QY0S8A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akVL7QY0S8A</a>) that punctures some of the myths with hard stats.",1228390837

385570,comment,384606,384606,0,0,istara,,,"Large organisations are modelled on the military.  So were schools.  And many more countries had compulsory national service.  Now schools are evolving and university with all its freedoms is more likely experience than military service for most new entrants to the workforce, it's not surprising that a huge, rigid, hierarchical structure is no longer relevant or even tolerable to many people.<p>Another point to bear in mind: more small companies means more outsourcing, particularly for legal, HR, IT support, and so on.  We should also see masses more companies using shared business premises, with shared receptions and so on.<p>Small companies should also mean more teleworking, since (1) people in small companies are generally more open to the idea of it, and (2) it's easier to keep track of what everyone in a smaller company is doing, even if they are working remotely, and (3) it means small companies can have international representation which may be one guy in a specific Asian country working from a bedroom-office.",1228390644

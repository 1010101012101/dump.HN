If the point is artificial happiness, why all this simulation stuff at all?",1187178939
42617,comment,42398,42398,0,0,robg,,,"Finally something I know a bit about...<p>I think where it's easy to believe the simulation theories is where they're so in line with what our brains do on an everyday basis. We simulate reality when we're getting ready for the day and deciding what to wear. Or when our stomach rumbles for lunch and we mentally compare General Tso's finest masterpiece against the toasty cheese of Quizno's. Indeed, I'd argue that the human brain is at it's best as a simulation engine - predicting the future and understanding the present based on past experiences<p>Don't fall for the 90% myth. We can't be sure where it came from, but it simply isn't true. The brain is a simple organ only in the sense that if you don't use it, you lose it. <p>Consider: You were born with 10x the number of cells you end up needing. The ones that survived are ones that found connections and strengthened them with their neighbors.<p>Indeed, that's what makes ""mind transplants"" so difficult to pull off. Your mind is a unique product of your development.<p>Now, neural implants for boosting abilities and restoring function after damage....",1187178853

It went from a money-leaking embarrassment to a top-tier release for MicroProse. The weekly meetings got easier, more developers were brought on, and the team managed to put together one hell of a game.""",1187178200

42614,comment,42540,42606,0,0,dood,,,"My reading was that the Cool Cam galvanised the management and the dev team, when they were feeling pretty stuck. It gave them a taste of the coolness that the project would be when done.<p>I sometimes do something a little similar, say I'm bogged down in something frustrating and complex, knocking up a protoype of something cool can breathe new life into a project. But its entirely possible that you're better at keeping yourself motivated and focused (without shiny things) than I am.",1187177951

42611,comment,42540,42540,0,0,bootload,,,"I own that game and I can't seem to remember all the faults as mentioned. I do remember the <i>""cool cam""</i> which was featured in demo mode.  But far from being the <i>technical failure</i> looking at how the graphics have been upgraded and mods contributed I'd say this game is a roaring success.  Maybe there's a lesson there to learn. Don't believe all you read. As a user the bugs mentioned did not distract from the game & game play. And just because there are some failures in the product doesn't mean you can't make money off it.<p>Check the Hi-Res terrains in the link below.<p>- <a href=""http://www.xmission.com/~mmagleby/eaw/downloads.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xmission.com/~mmagleby/eaw/downloads.htm</a><p>- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Air_War"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Air_War</a><p>Makes me want to find the disks right now to use the mods and look for those pesky bugs!",1187176778

One negative is that for those of us outside the Silicon Valley or YCombinator, it's possible that the articles and comments would focus more on programming than startup advice.  On the other hand, maybe it would be great to refocus every 6 months.  It would be a very unique idea.  This is not to disrespect what you've done--thank you for the articles, startup school, this site, community, and ycombinator.",1187176074

Even without any magical circular reasoning, the computer built on atoms and physics that we're being simulated in is just as deterministic as the computer I'm using, so I'm not sure I even see a difference.",1187175833

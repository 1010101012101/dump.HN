16575,comment,16566,16570,0,0,rms,,,"I think you would be better off charging $20 to host a game of up to 50 people. $2/person just seems really high to me. It's gotta be relatively cheap for the organizer to take money out of the pot and put it towards your site.<p>edit:   Read the article... you seem to be getting a decent amount of business, maybe it's worth charging significantly more for an unlimited option. It's certainly a hard service to price.",1177483357

16568,comment,16566,16566,0,0,jward,,,"I wouldn't exactly call that negative PR.  They didn't blame you, or come out and call you a monster.  It was more of a casual reference.  If my company was featured that way in a large publication I'd be fairly happy.<p>As a side note, nice idea for a site.  Every game I've been involved in was run by hand.  I'm not sure I'd be willing to pay $2 a person to organize it though.  Have you considered having an 'unlimited' account or the like for $100 or so?",1177480900

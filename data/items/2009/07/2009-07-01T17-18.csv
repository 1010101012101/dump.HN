Startups of decent calibur will not fail because the founders don't know closures, continuations, design patterns, etc; they'll still be able to build products.  They just wont have the vision to know the full range of products they are capable of building.  If that's the case, you'll only last as long as it takes for a better hacker to enter the market.

It is mostly used by very non-technical teachers and parents -- something on the order of 1,800 paying customers and about 100k free trials floating around out there.<p>What is new: While this app was a very good choice for desktopification 3 years ago, these days I thought I have both the skills and the OSS libraries to actually make a fair go of webifying it.  So I thought I'd try making a version in Rails.<p>Feature-wise the desktop version is still superior but I think the ease of use of the web app is fairly compelling.  (Your comments are appreciated.)  As of the next release of the desktop version it will feature integration with the web app (allowing people to, e.g., save their cards on my server so they can move them between computers, etc).  That feature is not demoable today.<p>Things that I rather like about the web version:<p>1)  Live preview on card editing.  (Prototype + Prawn + ImageMagick if you were wondering.)<p>2)  Guest logins, with an ""upsell"" while you're waiting for cards to print.  (Not a feature I would have included normally, but HN has convinced me of the utility.)<p>3)  Copious backend analytics.<p>4)  Time from front page to bingo cards coming out of printer: less than 30 seconds.<p>N.B. This is not the production system, since I want to do some tighter integration with the rest of my site and a bit of load testing prior to launch.  Anything you do will eventually be wiped.",1246468478

A few months ago, I was surprised to learn that the daughter of my wife's friend was not accepted to Ohio State.  She was an in-state resident with a 23 on her ACT.  Hardly a stellar score, but above the National average.  Back in my day (15 years ago), she would have been rubber-stamped.  Apparently, OSU was able to parlay its success on the football field into lots of undergrad applications.  So, they were able to become more selective.  This may be the start of a positive feedback loop that results in a reputation more like U of M than some random state college.<p>[No, I don't think reputation is everything.  But, if that's what they wanted to improve, sports may have been a very efficient mechanism for all the wrong reasons.]",1246468444

This has a 'just works automagically' aspect that's going to make it very popular, enough that it might well show in camera firmware within a few years if it can be sufficiently optimized.<p>Although this will be greatest interest to indie film and TV makers right now, selling to that market is a loss leader for most companies - the big bucks come from hobbyist consumers that want to shoot pictures or video but are happy to get an assist from the camera - hence the obsession with good autofocus on most camcorders, whereas pros are willing to pay a lot more for manual control of the focus plane.

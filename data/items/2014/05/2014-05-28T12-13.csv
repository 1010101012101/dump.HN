It would likely be false too, as it is less of a punishment, than it is not maximizing your chance to rank (to put your best foot forward as a website).<p>Accessibility is not a numbers game. In many countries it is a legal requirement. And adhering to the WCAG means providing non-JS fallbacks or progressive enhancement. RMS not being able to access your content is an accessibility issue too, it does not have to involve a disability. It can be technical in nature, like disabling JS or being behind a corporate firewall, or your browser not supporting pushstate.<p>If you want to look at stats, take a look at the stats and surveys on accessibility of dynamic web applications. Just because your screenreader supports JavaScript does not mean you have no accessibility issues due to JavaScript. Rich internet applications should use WAI-ARIA. I don&#x27;t think people who create websites without a fallback (avoiding this issue entirely), will worry about creating websites with ARIA-support. And if they do care about such accessibility, they should also provide a non-ARIA non-JS fallback.<p>Google making this change makes it possible to have your non-fallback JS-only application be indexed. It does not make it more attractive from an SEO or accessibility viewpoint.",1401281843

For a similar idea, note that if I select a number uniformly from the interval [0,1], the prior odds of choosing whatever number I did choose were also zero, but by the construction of the problem I had to end up with something.)<p>This means that if you find a rational number, you should immediately suspect that it&#x27;s like that for a good reason.

It&#x27;s just diverting money from other uses. To get increased economic output, you have to spend the money you are getting on something that expands production.<p>In other words, landscaping is a consumptive activity, not a productive one (and that&#x27;s fine).<p>So as far as I can see, your analysis falls prey to the same fallacy I was trying to guard against.<p>The fallacy is that it doesn&#x27;t matter if money is miss-spent (e.g. by government) because it all gets consumed, anyway; it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere. If there was only purely consumption (or, rather, exactly enough production to support existing consumption), in the net, it would be a zero sum game. Someone who holds this fallacy doesn&#x27;t understand production or appreciate its significance. When production exceeds consumption, then consumption can and does expand to equal it out, but the expansion of production has to come first.<p>Re: The stock market. When you buy a share of stock from one of the original founders, you are locking up your money, but freeing up his money to go be invested in something he thinks will be more productive (otherwise he wouldn&#x27;t want to sell the stock). He may also invest in a publicly traded company, but eventually, on down the line, the money gets invested in expanding productivity, such as venture capital. That&#x27;s why the venture capitalist profession exists.<p>By the way, the reason those companies are so valuable is because regular investors are willing to pay X (which turns out to be huge) for a certain % of the company&#x27;s earning potential. (Even if that potential is getting reinvested in the company instead of paying dividends, it&#x27;s the same principle.)",1401280236

The default assumption that I have is that advertising companies that deal in user profiles (such as Google) will collect everything they can about you because this benefits their ability to sell advertising. Google&#x27;s terms of service states what they capture, in other words no matter what their user interface is telling you their <i>privacy policy</i> (which I consider to be the leading document in cases like these) tells a totally different story and and generalizes to all of google&#x27;s services, including search (they even use that as the example of what they capture).<p>The fact that things like cookies are in those logs that they do make (again, according to the privacy policy) makes it trivial to re-construct the data that they ostensibly do not keep. If it is trivial, makes good business sense, enhances the value of the profile and makes more money then you can bet dollars to donuts that unless there are <i>strong</i> statements to the contrary from the company involved that they do not engage in such behaviour that they do.<p>Privacy policies are generally written in favour of the company writing them and it would be terribly naive to assume that if it could be written more strict but wasn&#x27;t that this is an accident or oversight. Note how long google fought the EU commission to have any limits set on their permission to retain user data, and how they tried to spin it as a user benefit when they eventually caved in.<p>So if google re-writes their privacy police to state explicitly that they do not datamine their logs and that the data is used only in a statistical sense and never in a personally identifiable sense then I would agree with you (and I would even believe them), but until they do it is fairly safe to assume that they in fact do use that information.<p>Of course &#x27;only to enhance your user experience&#x27; and never to improve the bottom line for google.",1401278675

I think people are just using this as one example. Personally I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a very good example, but you won&#x27;t see a thread on HN about Apple purposely breaking X so Y is more difficult (for example the android imessage fiasco), or the fact that many &#x27;innovations&#x27; by Apple, like thunderbolt or retina, are really just &#x27;one-upping&#x27; the competition and attempting to lock the consumer in to something that&#x27;s no more than a gimmick.<p>Sure thunderbolt is fast, but it&#x27;s not something that any tech company couldn&#x27;t design, it&#x27;s just something to break compatibility between systems. Microsoft and many other tech companies are guilty of the same thing. Maybe google could make lighteningBolt on their chromebooks that goes just a little faster then thunderbolt, and then MS can make FTLBOLT on the surface that goes just a little faster than lighteningBolt, and then we can have no universal standards.<p>Next every company can come up with their own formats for their devices to make cross-compatibility impossible!<p>Like I said, Apple isn&#x27;t the only company that&#x27;s guilty of this, but they certainly seem to be the worst offender, especially when it comes to the consumer. If you&#x27;re an investor it&#x27;s great though, because they do everything they can to hook the consumer and make sure they can&#x27;t go back.<p>Personally I&#x27;m not a fan of the Apple ecosystem.

You say in your article:<p>>While having this sort of HTML fallback was technically possible, it added a lot of extra work to public-facing single page apps, to the point where many developers dropped the idea...<p>A JS-driven site with an HTML fallback is a normal page. Then you don&#x27;t need any tricks or force Google to run your application and hopefully make pages out of them. Start with the fall-back and enhance.<p>This is a serious mistake with consequences. Tor bundle and Firefox shipped with JavaScript support, because disabling JS broke too much of the current web. It causes accessibility issues (remember when Twitter changed to hash-bang URL&#x27;s?), if not for Googlebot, then for regular users (From the Webmaster Guidelines):<p>>Following these guidelines will help Google find, index, and rank your site.<p>>Use a text browser such as Lynx to examine your site, because most search engine spiders see your site much as Lynx would. If fancy features such as JavaScript, cookies, session IDs, frames, DHTML, or Flash keep you from seeing all of your site in a text browser, then search engine spiders may have trouble crawling your site.<p>>Make pages primarily for users, not for search engines.<p>I am still going on the assumption that you created a one-page application without a time-consuming fallback, and you rely on Google to make rankable pages from them. Then you leave some users standing in the cold, so why deserve to rank equal to a user-friendly accessible web page?<p>> ... single page apps might rank differently or worse than normal pages ...<p>From the original article, the most current source on this:<p>> Sometimes things don&#x27;t go perfectly during rendering, which may negatively impact search results for your site.<p>> It&#x27;s always a good idea to have your site degrade gracefully. This will help users enjoy your content even if their browser doesn&#x27;t have compatible JavaScript implementations. It will also help visitors with JavaScript disabled or off, as well as search engines that can&#x27;t execute JavaScript yet.<p>> Sometimes the JavaScript may be too complex or arcane for us to execute, in which case we can’t render the page fully and accurately.<p>> Some JavaScript removes content from the page rather than adding, which prevents us from indexing the content.<p>In the SEO community Googlebot&#x27;s improvements were noted for a while now. See for example: <a href=""http://ipullrank.com/googlebot-is-chrome/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ipullrank.com/googlebot-is-chrome/</a><p>Single page websites or application-as-content-website&#x27;s are not popular among SEO&#x27;s. One reason for this is that it doesn&#x27;t allow for fine-grained control on keyword targeting,  and keeping the site canonical, and it can waste domain authority when you have less targeted pages in the index than you can rank for. Experiment and find out for yourself.",1401278596

7362377,comment,7359992,7362287,2,0,saurik,,,"> Time and time again, ignorant and lazy human beings are the enablers of security breaches. You can blame humans all you want, but if systems aren&#x27;t designed with such human factors in mind, they simply won&#x27;t work in the real world.<p>This same statement, however, underlies my argument in the other direction: that ignorant and lazy human beings build systems that don&#x27;t have entropy pools that fill fast enough at boot to make /dev/urandom secure for the things they are running there. If the software were using /dev/random instead, it defends against the systems integrator making this mistake by blocking until the system has enough entropy.<p>Now, it <i>also</i> will potentially block later as well, which sucks: however, this is going to happen to a subset of users building systems under heavy load. Rather than letting the user run rampant, profiling the code, finding /dev/random to be the bottleneck, and replacing it with a file of hardcoded &quot;random numbers&quot;, how about giving the user a setting &quot;if you are reasonably confident you are not using this during boot before the entropy pool is ready for /dev/urandom, turn on this non-default setting and the software will never block&quot;?<p>Under the assumption, however, that this somehow has to be a black/white &quot;choose one, only one, no options, no workarounds&quot; issue, defending against the ill-informed system integrators seems like a much more reasonable position than defending against the downright-idiotic system integrators. The downright-idiotic system integrators probably also left a bunch of other holes in their systems: let&#x27;s help out the ill-informed ones a little, and use defaults that are more difficult to break.<p>> > Look: that just isn&#x27;t always possible. I say this not from theory, but from the trenches of information security.<p>> I&#x27;d have to say that you&#x27;re confusing &quot;not possible&quot; with &quot;hasn&#x27;t been done yet.&quot;<p>The argument in that paragraph involved an Android device. If my Android device doesn&#x27;t sufficient entropy when I go to run the software I downloaded from the Android Market at the moment that software attempts to generate an encryption key I need, it is &quot;not possible&quot; for any of 1) me (most devices have locked bootloaders), 2) the developer of the app, 3) the developer of any cryptography libraries the developer used, to fix the problem.<p>> The security field needs to start using some of the same pragmatic strategies the NTSB uses to prevent plane crashes. We can&#x27;t just stand around wishing programmers know more about crypto and security. We need to put measures in place that actually work.<p>I agree: how about someone makes it so that Linux itself has the FreeBSD behavior of blocking /dev/urandom until the entropy pool has reached the critical mass required to make its randomness generation secure? ;P Alternatively, how about someone gets it into all the common init daemons to read enough data from /dev/random at boot to guarantee work around this kernel limitation? It sounds like everyone is just asking for mistakes by encouraging people to write software that uses /dev/urandom to run on systems that have a known-limitation in the usage of /dev/urandom.",1394222192

At issue was whether the definition of &quot;aircraft&quot; applied to the model aircraft that Mr. Pirker was flying. You&#x27;re correct in stating that every aircraft, as defined under the regulations, must have FAA approval (in most cases, a COA). The judge concluded specifically that &quot;aircraft as defined in 14 CFR  Part 1, Section 1.1 does not include model aircraft.[1] The conclusion to be drawn is that the FAA approval process does not apply to model aircraft. This finding was in addition to finding that the FAA policies on model aircraft - including the ban on commercial use - are not legally enforceable.<p>[1]&quot;Neither the Part 1, Section. 1.1, or the 49 U.S.C.

7362349,comment,7360076,7362183,6,0,bane,,,"Thanks for providing some clarification and color to my very hazy brain dump.<p>I <i>do</i> remember my parent&#x27;s &quot;climate controlled&quot; filing room and filing system for client artwork and other sundry. It was basically a big storage room filled with racks of old paper shipping boxes and large grey envelopes. The customer order would get written up on triplicate carbon free paper (customer, contact info, type of job, ink, references to artwork, due date etc), one color for the front office, one for the &quot;lookup&quot; catalog (organized by customer name) and one would go on the front of the envelope. All the artwork, disks, negatives, proofs, a few final samples and other assets for the job would go in the envelope and get organized onto a shelf.<p>Every job generated a new job number that was something like yearmonth-sequential# so a job coming in today might be 201403-38 and jobs folders were roughly organized by the 201403 part.<p>If a customer came in and said &quot;I want another 10,000 of that job I had you print lat Oct&quot; we&#x27;d go to the catalog, lookup their name, find the 201310-# job and go pull it from the shelf to review. It usually took just a few minutes to find something. I think every 7 or 8 years we&#x27;d go through and purge old files just because there simply wasn&#x27;t the physical space.<p>They&#x27;d also use the job # part of the serial, when writing up jobs, to keep a rough estimate on business volume. Since every month the job # started back over at 1, and you knew that you&#x27;d on average do 600 jobs a month, you could get a feel if the month was slow or fast just be seeing what the next job id was going to be on a given date.<p>The job id&#x27;s were then used in scheduling. For a <i>long</i> time my father drew up the schedules by hand. He had a grid printed up on large format paper, and I remember him coming home every day with a stack of the front office carbon-free copies for the day and drawing up the production schedule on the grid.<p>I think the hours of the work day were along the top of the grid and the equipment operator was along the side. He used some kind of color coding system (with the full job # and a legend) to trace the job through the work-day as it moved through various pieces of equipment and such, and he&#x27;d use some known metrics for how long it&#x27;d take to do that kind of job on this or that equipment, and budget it out. There was quite an art to it. Especially for big jobs that spanned multiple days that needed to be kept track of.<p>It was kind of a Gantt chart, but a little different. And it provided a clear visualization of all the production going on at a glance. He&#x27;d make a couple copies and one would go in the production room so any operator could go check it for their next job, or to see if they were on schedule (sometimes they didn&#x27;t agree and they&#x27;d go make their case for a schedule adjustment).<p>Sometime in the late 90s he finally got a computer and reproduced the entire thing in Excel, which meant he could do all the scheduling at work instead of at home. When they finally sold their company, the new owners were impressed enough with the system that I think they adopted it for their business.",1394221982

The F-15 doesn&#x27;t have that. Instead, what it has is a system where the stick is connected mechanically to the hydraulic system. On top of that, two electronic systems (the Pitch/Roll Channel Assembly and Aileron Rudder Interconnect) can provide an additional variable control input to the hydraulic actuators, to even out the feel of the stick in varying flight conditions. It also provides inputs to improve the dynamic flight characteristics of the plane: <a href=""http://www.f15sim.com/operation/f15_flight_control_system.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.f15sim.com/operation/f15_flight_control_system.ht...</a> (see the paragraphs under &quot;Control Augmentation System.&quot;)<p>So the F-15&#x27;s control system provides additional electronic input to the control services to improve flight characteristics, but isn&#x27;t totally in charge of the airplane in the same way as a true fly by wire system. For example, the electronics cannot move the control surfaces through their full range of motion, and are strictly reactive to the pilot&#x27;s stick input.",1394221105

You do not know on what operating systems or at what point in the bootup process it will be used. You know it works fine <i>if and only if</i> /dev/urandom has been seeded, and so use /dev/urandom.<p>However, apparently, people install your daemon at boot and generate the keys at boot, on VMs that are created often from scratch. There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with these computers: they have entropy sources, they just don&#x27;t have any entropy at boot, the referenced &quot;boot-time entropy hole&quot;.<p>Your code now &quot;doesn&#x27;t work&quot;. It isn&#x27;t that it crashes, it doesn&#x27;t block: in fact there&#x27;s no way at all to tell that anything wrong happened, except that some point a long time later someone finds out that every encryption key you generated from it is from a limited, guessable, &quot;weak&quot; subset.<p>The argument here seems to be that this is the fault of the person who built the computer. Honestly, I somewhat agree. However, let&#x27;s imagine the real-world conversation that would happen if the developer of this library/daemon actually stated this limitation up-front in their README somewhere.<p>README: &quot;Note: this program only works correctly if the entropy pool is adequately seeded before running it.&quot;<p>User: &quot;Wow, ok; can you tell me if Ubuntu is up to the challenge?&quot;<p>Developer: &quot;No. It isn&#x27;t that simple: the system doesn&#x27;t block boot for the entropy pool to fill, so whether your system is setup correctly is up to whether entropy fills fast enough; your chosen distribution is one aspect of this, but we will also need to look at what kinds of hardware you have attached and external factors such as whether the network you are using gets much traffic.&quot;<p>User: &quot;Seriously? Is there some simple test I can run on my computer that would let me determine if my system is broken?&quot;<p>Developer: &quot;No. These are complex factors that are difficult to verify statically. Your attempts to analyze the data yourself will also almost certainly come long after the entropy pool has already received the critical mass required for /dev/urandom to become secure. Your attempting to run the test would also affect a lot of the entropy sources directly, including network and input.&quot;<p>User: &quot;But it <i>is possible</i> if I spent more time on it?&quot;<p>Developer: &quot;Well, sure: there was a paper published where some researchers instrumented the kernel attempting to analyze these issues. They were able to determine that OpenSSH on RedHat was generating its host keys only just barely after the entropy cutoff on standard desktop computers. You could make similar patches to your kernel and attempt to see whether your usage seems safe.&quot;<p>User: &quot;That sounds ludicrous... was there really no way for you to code around this?&quot;<p>Developer: &quot;Oh, sure, we could use /dev/random; but then sometimes the program would block under heavy load when it really didn&#x27;t need to; rather than just changing to /dev/urandom, some of our users were responding by hardcoding the randomness of our program entirely, defeating all of the security in our system. To protect these people we decided to switch to /dev/urandom ourselves.&quot;<p>User: &quot;Couldn&#x27;t you have made that an option, choosing the most generally secure option by default, but providing /dev/urandom as a sane alternative &#x27;when using under heavy load&#x27;, thereby guiding people who have this issue to not do something insane? Maybe you could read /dev/random once when your program starts, to get the blocking behavior, and then switch to /dev/urandom for later repeated use?&quot;<p>Developer: &quot;No. This is apparently a black and white issue, and we have to decide emphatically whether /dev/random should <i>always</i> be used or should <i>never</i> be used. The idea that this might be a complex issue that requires nuance in thought and might have to be decided on a case by case basis, or for which there might be some solution that involves working around the issues with one by using the other momentarily, should not occur to us.&quot;<p>[edit:] (So, it sounds like maybe the correct solution at this point is that the user seeds /dev/urandom themselves using /dev/random. Of course, this solution only works if the user is smart enough to do this and has access to do it, neither of which are likely true on many Android devices. The developer could do this for the user, but that&#x27;s back into the &quot;nuance&quot; discussion. Instead of being so emphatic that &quot;/dev/random should never be used&quot; people should be advocating developers use actual solutions, potentially &quot;workarounds&quot;, to the problems that come up in real-world deployment :/.)",1394220946

I worked for an ad agency, typesetter, publisher, and finally in the art department of a flexo plate maker. When I first started, we used drafting boards, T-squares, X-acto knives, and rubber cement. Type was of the hot variety - photo type was only for display type, not body copy. In the late 80s I was trained on two SOTA production machines: a DuPont VASTER system (used both vector and raster graphics), and later a Context system that ran on Sun workstations.<p>The typesetter your parents bought was likely either a Compugraphic or A/M (Adressograph Multigraph) - in the pre-DTP days, they seemed to have most of the market for phototypsetting systems (at least for smaller businesses). I worked with both, and your description would fit either of them.<p>I guess I would somewhat dispute your assertion that layouts (or paste-ups/mechanicals as they&#x27;re more properly called) took &quot;forever&quot; or that it was a &quot;very long&quot; process. Using the &quot;Thin and Pretty&quot; layout in the article as an example, the last place I worked we probably would have budgeted an hour for the job - typesetting, mechanical, camera work, and (maybe) printing plates (all done in-house). I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s terribly out of line with the time it would take using DTP. (That doesn&#x27;t include design time!)<p>When we were first making the switch from the old manual operation to digital, we often found it took longer to do the work using DTP; it wasn&#x27;t unusual to hear an artist say &quot;Screw it&quot; and go back to his light table to finish a job. But that was to be expected - unfortunately, a number of my co-workers had little or no computer experience. Over time that ended, although the company did keep two full-time artists on staff who did nearly everything the &quot;old&quot; way until about 2000. The huge advantage of DTP, especially early on, was that changes/additions/corrections were so much easier. And in our case, it was considerably easier to actually <i>find</i> artwork on the computer. All our paste-ups were done on #20 illustration board (for dimensional stability) and they were filed in row after row after row of architectural file cabinets. Unfortunately, no one had ever devised a good filing system, so it would often take 2 or 3 or 4 times as long to find the freakin&#x27; art you needed to make a change on as it took to actually make the change...",1394220312

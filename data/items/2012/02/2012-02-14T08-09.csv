At this point, she abandoned her scientific career to fill this enormous vacuum.<p>Thatcher got a bachelor's degree in Chemistry, but within three years of graduating college she was in politics and another three years later she had a law degree, I don't think I'd call her a ""scientist leader"".<p>I'll admit my ignorance about the Chinese Communist party. But that whole system is very different, especially because the leaders don't need to get elected, so it's a much more technocratic system in general. In the US, there's a difference between people who come up with new policies and the politicians who get them implemented, I suspect this is less true in China.",1329209702

Why should we? Who said scientists are better in protecting one's rights than, say, cops or doctors or lawyers or plumbers? I do not see anything in scientific training that makes scientists uniquely suitable for that. I would prefer, naturally, to have smart people protecting my rights, as this way they will be more effective in it, but one can be smart without being a scientist.<p>Of course, the government would always have a lot of purely technical questions where scientific training would allow one to decide them efficiently - but these always would be secondary roles and rarely need to be elected, but rather properly hired, which can be done by any decent manager.

I am mainly a programmer and not a natural designer.<p>After about a day or so of trying out to move my existing UI (of a fairly successful app) to bootstrap, I found it a bit limiting in some ways. The commonest one being to try and change the color of the nav bar.<p>Also the 'brand' style in Nav bar should support logos too. Perhaps provide a css code for it.<p>Also in general there is just one way(albiet good) you can do for all things, which I also did not like.<p>In a comparative way, jquery UI themes, give me a better default option over there. And I can choose a theme from several themes.<p>Another thing is that many of the bootstrap's components example 'TypeAhead' are again jquery plugins, for which you get competing options in the Jquery UI.<p>I also think, that creators of bootstrap are hurrying up with version numbers. 2.0 is a very aggressive call. In the light of, just a few months back, we just heard of bootstrap on HN. Opensource versioning has to more trustworthy than corporate versioning (a recent good example is node.js they are .6xxx . Jquery itself is still 1.7.xxx)<p>The above are my brief thoughts after playing with it for a day or so. Hope it helps somebody.",1329208071

Do influencers lose influence when they lose objectivity? What the fuck is an influencer, anyway?<p>If a journalist is ever an influencer, he or she is doing it wrong...<p>Buh, I could go on a giant rant here about how journalism is dead, or at least, extremely sick... How am I going to write about people places and events when those people places and events are writing about themselves?<p>Fortunately, it would seem there is still a consumer for quality, deep journalism on specific topics.<p>I don't even know what I'm really saying here, anymore... Just that Lyons really hit a nerve. It's super frustrating to be in an interview with someone who makes 10X what you make, and is completely unaware of what's really going on in their industry.... All too common an event.",1329206705

I'm in KY and our local high school team always does well, and our college team, while never great, had a good season last year, as well, and has a few bright stars amongst its roster. March is crazy here. It's nothing but basketball, basketball, basketball, and my Facebook and Twitter feeds fill up with commentary every time there's a game. The local community gets behind it, even at the high school level. The school district closes school for the day if the team has an out-of-town game in the state tournament, so people can attend, etc. (As a parent, I don't agree with this action, but none the less, it is interesting from a social perspective).<p>I'm not a huge fan of the sport, but even I find it hard not to get sucked in.",1329206441

I would not want my neighbors regularly renting their apartment while they are out of town. There is already a substantial enough difference in decorum and responsibility between owners and renters that condo associations as well as the mortgage industry (as well as FHA) establish maximum renter to owner ratios.<p>I live in a high rise that also contains a hotel, but with different lobbies and elevators, and that doesn't bother me. I think this is because a hotel has a management staff that maintains common area decorum and holds occupants responsible for their actions during their stay. An apartment rented on airbnb has no similar oversight or responsibility for common facilities.<p>[<a href=""http://delmar.typepad.com/brianbrady/2011/06/owner-occupancy-ratio-in-condominium-complexes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delmar.typepad.com/brianbrady/2011/06/owner-occupancy...</a>]",1357934354

another promise framework is Silex based on Symfony , it's easy to wire any symfony component through services and unlike Laravel it doesnt rely on Static methods or Singletons.

Hence the precision one is aiming for, does not seem like an improvement on the original brevity of the yes/no.""</i><p>I completely understand this response, I actually really do mean I will do everything I possibly can to meet this obligation, but also recognize my commitment is not equivalent to other commitments by people who might use the same phrase.<p>I find myself stuck in this dilemma:<p>1) I can say ""no"" which cuts off the conversation and makes me appear unsupportive.<p>2) I can say ""No, I don't think I will be able to."" Which at least invites the requestor to inquire further.<p>3) I can say ""I'll do my best"" which accurately conveys my personal intent but sounds weak to the recipient.<p>4) I can say ""Sure, I can probably do that"" where I signal that my intent is yes but I can see issues which may interfere with my execution.<p>5) I can say ""Sure"" and 'bet on the come' as they say in Vegas which means that if things outside of my control happen in the best possible way I'll be able to fulfill the obligation, and if they don't I'll fail at filling the obligation and let you down.<p>I have observed that option 5 is the normal usage. It results in experiences like the one Bruce had where there are lots of commitments and not necessarily a lot of follow through. And at low ""value"" in terms of the commitment/cost the discussion of how much trust is impacted is interesting.<p>I've also observed that people in management that always say ""yes"" even if they only deliver a smaller percentage of the time on their commitments are more successful (in terms of raises, promotions etc) than people who actually only commit to things they actually think they can do[1]. So as a success strategy always saying yes, regardless of your understanding seems like a winning strategy.

Productizing the concept led to me understand some of the problems inherent with goal setting, and what you can do to counter them.<p>Most people share a similar set of vague goals. ""Eat healthier."" ""Make more money."" ""Do what I love."" ""Fall in love."" But very few want to take the time to break down how they would accomplish it. The more time you spend on this step, the closer you'll get to understanding challenges you might face and learning how to overcome them.<p>The act of sharing your goal makes you put less effort into achieving it[0]. We get a kind of high from imagining ourselves completing it, and this partially satisfies the urge to complete it.<p>How do you set a time limit for your harder goals? And what happens when you don't achieve them within your established timeframe? For many people, failure can be depressing. Know in advance that timelines are fluid and that missing a milestone is okay.<p>It's hard to group daily life tasks under your broader, overarching goals. Take time out daily (ideally at the start of the day) to remind yourself why you're doing what you're doing. At the end of the day, review whether what you did helped or hindered your stated long-term goals.<p>Just a few suggestions from a year's worth of seeing how 20,000 people try to accomplish their goals.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_you...</a>",1357932910

Newspapers, magazines, billboards, TV ads, and other physical media don't have the equivalent of cookies and companies still pay to advertise that way. I don't know anything about advertising but I don't see why an online ad couldn't just consist of a jpg or text, a url and a contract between 2 parties. Obviously that type of ad wouldn't just be a JS snippet you drop into a page. I'm picturing a process like 1. Create some good content 2. Show it to an perspective advertiser with a 'Your Ad Here' placeholder 3. Agree to display an exclusive ad for a certain amount of time. The advertiser can check you're actually showing the ad however they do for physical media. They can also estimate it's effectiveness however they do for physical media. Obviously reputation would play a big role. If the content creator becomes popular enough advertisers will flock to them, if they're just starting out they'll have to solicit companies to sell advertising at a super low prices or give it away for a while. People would have to talk to each other, establish a little trust with each other and take a few monetary risks but isn't that what business is all about? The JS snippet ads could stay around too, but if this law spreads, which I hope it does NOT, it's going to annoy the hell out of people, a browser plugin is more annoying IMO, so that's not the solution.

Keep in mind, this is going from <i>absolutely zero</i> organization to at least a basic system, so if you're already a structural person, YMMV.<p>I use Workflowy for this, and it's nearly perfect for the job.  If you've been thinking of doing something like this, I recommend you try this out.  It's <i>extremely</i> fast and I feel like it has greatly improved my life.<p>My workflowy layout looks like this:<p><pre><code>  Goals
    - Weekly
    - Monthly
    - Yearly
  
  Todo
    - Today
    - Tomorrow
    - etc
  
  Backlog
    - These are proposals for things to fold into my todo list.  They include current projects, things I want to learn, hobbies I want to start, etc.
  
  Roadblocked / not ready
    - Items that cannot be accomplished yet due to another person or event
  Projects
    - This is a repository for notes about my current projects.  I use workflowy's @ and # tags for this, and link specific labels to items / groups in my Todo list.  (This is one of the cool things about   Workflowy)
  
  Ideas for applications
    - I have a large repository of ideas I've had.  These range from half-baked ""in the shower"" ideas, to fully flushed out business models with market research, presentation text, etc.  
    - This is a very subtle but extremely useful way to record your thoughts.  There's almost no friction between typing ""ctrl + t, w, return, @ideas"" any time I'm using a web browser with a keyboard.
  
  Random thoughts
    - Other things I'm thinking</code></pre>",1357931578

The good news is you can very easily make this your reality by changing a setting in your browser.<p>There are tons of reasons why ""read-only"" could make use of cookies. Here are a few, using your ecommerce example:<p>1) A/B test
2) General site analytics, to see how many unique visits your shop gets
3) More detailed conversion analytics to figure out things like the value of a visit, how long someone takes before making a purchase, knowing the origination of all conversions, etc. 
4) Remembering viewed items so they can be promoted on a future visit
5) Displaying a ""Welcome back"" message to second time visitors<p>If you don't do these things you will be beaten by people that do. eCommerce might be the absolute worst example you could have come up with for situations where cookies are not needed.",1357931567

You cannot do a frequency cap without cookies. I could have instead tried to sell a static image or whatever you think would work, but that deal would not have gotten done. This was a CPM campaign, so let's forget that as a possibility. How would affiliate advertising work without cookies (hint: it doesn't). So that's out too. Let's try CPC. Perhaps you can do the leg-work for me and find someone willing to pay me per click for anonymous users that may or may not exist, but I have yet to find one.<p>This is all ignoring the fact that without cookies you have absolutely no idea how much inventory you have and what its profile looks like.

A forum with 1M page views could have 10k members and be nearly worthless to advertisers, but a blog with 1M page views could be 500k unique visitors that are very desirable for advertisers.

The problem I have is that I sometimes need basically all my RAM for simulations (yes, occasionally even on my laptop) and my current only has 4GB (with OS X eating up about 1.5GB on startup for ""kernel tasks"") so it's dangerous to run a VM with more than 2GB.

Bitcoin, as far as I can tell, ignores structural biases preventing people from accessing the cryptocurrency. We can see evidence of this in the &quot;Bitcoin in Africa&quot; startups, which on the surface seem benign and even benevolent, but are hiding an uninterrogated colonialism: their chief assumption, it seems to me, is that the developed world will always control more of Bitcoin&#x27;s limited resources, and the value of spreading a small portion of those resources to the developing world comes from lock-in. It&#x27;s a classic unfair trade agreement, and it doesn&#x27;t take much thought to see how problematic this situation can become.<p>eBay can bend you over with fees because they control the market; Bitcoin&#x27;s limited resources are susceptible to the same kind of market control.

9146018,comment,9145284,9145284,0,0,mrb,,,"The author&#x27;s post is full of misguided opinions, and inaccuracies.<p><i>&quot;Reason 1: Bitcoin will not replace retail payment systems&quot;</i><p>Bitcoin is more of an enabler than a replacer. There are many financial transactions that do <i>not</i> take place because current financial platforms do not let them happen. For example with Bitcoin I could in theory pay an artist in Namibia who makes little sculptures and ships them to worldwide. This economic activity does not exist today because there is no safe/efficient way to pay some random guy in Namibia who does not have a bank account.<p><i>&quot;Scenario 2 [transaction count must increase 250 folds] and 3 [Price increases 250 folds to $65000/BTC] are not likely to occur&quot;</i><p>So the author hand-waves that and says it cannot continue to happen with zero reasons? To see a combined 250 fold increase all we need to see is a number of transactions increasing by 25x (which will happen with the upcoming block size increase) and a price increasing by 10x. Consider that:<p>- the number of transactions has already increased 1,000 fold (and more) in the past few years, and there is no sign of it slowing down: <a href=""https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?showDataPoints=false&show_header=true&daysAverageString=7&timespan=all&scale=0&address="" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?showDataPoints...</a><p>- the price has already increased 1,000 fold (and more) in the past few years: <a href=""https://blockchain.info/charts/market-price?showDataPoints=false&show_header=true&daysAverageString=7&timespan=all&scale=1&address="" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/charts/market-price?showDataPoints=f...</a><p>So the author ought to explain to us why he thinks such increases would suddenly stop.<p><i>&quot;Fiat conversion makes Bitcoin transactions even more expensive&quot;</i><p>The author completely ignores the economic incentive of transactions within the Bitcoin economy itself. When I give 1 BTC to my father, he can spend 1 BTC on Dell.com. No fiat conversion takes place.<p><i>&quot;Reason 2: Bitcoin will not end the need for trusted central parties&quot;</i><p>I agree with this, but I do not see at all why the author listed this as a reason why Bitcoin will not succeed. In some cases having a central trusted party does make sense, in others it does not.<p><i>&quot;When is censorship resistance so important that it is worthwhile to make those trade offs? The answer is: illegal use cases&quot;</i><p>Or: oppressive governments who seize the bank accounts of dissidents, Paypal when they decide to shut down the accounts of donation receivers (because their fraud system incorrectly interprets such sudden flows of money as fraud), etc. You see, the world is bigger than you. There are many instances where censorship resistance is important and is needed for <i>legal</i> use cases.<p><i>&quot;Whereas most Bitcoin users are primarily using Bitcoin as a speculative asset and illegal transactions&quot;</i><p>The author provides no source for the &quot;illegal transactions&quot;, because he has no data to back this up, because this claim is false. In fact the biggest illegal shops have been shut down (SR 1.0, SR 2.0). And the number of legit merchants continues to increase (now surpassing 100,000 merchants accepting Bitcoin worldwide).<p><i>&quot;Internet did not make design trade-offs to primarily focus on censorship resistance at the expense of other qualities (such as speed)&quot;</i><p>Yes it did make trade-offs. Internet was designed to be decentralized to make it resilient (which is similar to censorship resistance), at the expense of complexity (it took decades to develop a stack that works well: BGP / IP / TCP / UDP / DNS / HTTP).<p><i>&quot;If online gambling were to become legal and widely accepted by banks, Bitcoin would not be used to gamble online&quot;</i><p>Another flawed argument. Let me try this: &quot;if <i>online reselling</i> were to become legal and widely accepted by banks, Bitcoin would not be used by <i>online merchants</i>&quot;. Yet 100,000 merchants are using Bitcoin...<p><i>&quot;However, Bitcoin has shown us the promise of blockchain technologies&quot;</i><p>The author does not understand that Bitcoin&#x27;s block chain technology simply cannot exist without Bitcoin (the currency): why would miners mine if they received no bitcoins rewards? For the block chain technology to succeed, Bitcoin needs to succeed, and vice versa.",1425491785

It&#x27;s calculated for AMT, so if you&#x27;re already paying AMT, or would be paying AMT with the addition of this income, then yes: You&#x27;ll be paying that tax now. This is true for many in California with the high state taxes and a relatively high gross income (versus national averages).<p>However, if the intrinsic value portion of your exercise (i.e. fair market value minus your strike price) as an addition to your AMT worksheet does not indicate you&#x27;ll owe AMT for the year, then you will NOT see a tax event. This will be true for many non-Californians exercising after their first year, or even after 4 years, depending on the growth of the fair-market-value.<p>If you are at risk of paying AMT and your intrinsic value is in the low 6-figures (or lower), one solution might be to wait until the beginning of a new tax year, exercise, and quit your job... then take a year off from wages and work for equity (i.e. form your own startup).  You&#x27;ll avoid paying the 26% on that money due at exercise. If you&#x27;ve been paying AMT in the past, you&#x27;ll even get a tax credit at the end of the year. Obviously, this plan is not without risks, should only be carried-out if you believe in solid growth in the startup for which you own equity and believe in the ability of the new startup you&#x27;re founding and/or joining.  Also, and obviously, you should consult with an actual accountant before considering this crazy idea ;-)",1425491577

Depending on the department (and faculty) they&#x27;re administered differently. In engineering (where I did my Ph.D.), you had to do a proposal which was submitted to your committee. Then, you had an oral exam. Half of which was questions on your proposal and the other was about your background knowledge in the field. It could take as long as they wanted. Mine only ended because they wanted lunch (it was 3.5 hours long). Also, you were required to take 3 courses, which you were pretty much expected to complete before your comprehensive exam.<p>The 3 papers makes a thesis also ignores the fact that it needs to be a coherent whole and pass the thesis defence, where the committee includes both a person external to the department and one external to the university. While I&#x27;ll grant 3 papers is probably a thesis, it entirely depends on the papers.<p>Everybody in STEM courses at my university did both an RA and a TA unless they had a large scholarship and didn&#x27;t need any extra money. In the CS department, it was actually expected (I was co-supervised by a CS prof for my Master&#x27;s so I know what the other people in my lab did).<p>I had a girlfriend who did her PhD in Mechanical Engineering and she was actually required to do contract work in her lab. She couldn&#x27;t even get paid for it and was still required to do it. She was in the Canadian military and they were paying for her to do the doctorate so she couldn&#x27;t get paid from anyone else (but she had a scholarship which was allowed). The contract work delayed her thesis research, but the professor required her to do the work.

As a founder, how does one balance one’s evangelical passion about the product/mission with the responsibility one has to explain the risks of a job to new employees? Should one just be super passionate and expect the employee to have a “caveat emptor” approach, or is there a minimum threshold of kimono-opening one should do in order to advise potential hires of the riskiness of both the market generally and one’s startup specifically?<p>2. In the case of the people who were fired from 42Floors, being a good broker is a very fungible skill and is relatively agnostic of firm affiliation; either you’re good at selling real estate or you’re not (compared to, say, being a good designer, where a given individual might be excellent in one role and terrible in another, depending on team and mission). Anyway, question is: when hiring employees with fungible, broker-like skillsets, is it appropriate to be more — I don’t know what the term is, risk-tolerant, freewheeling, forward-leaning, etc — in deciding whether it’s appropriate to hire a new person? The logic here being that if things go bad (as they did at 42Floors), those people will be able to land on their feet relatively easily, compared to others who are going to need more time/effort to find a new job.
3. If you have raised a lot of money and have cash in the bank, and lay off an entire division of people, what is your obligation to give them severance / extended health care / etc? My inclination would be to be very generous in this regard (i.e., firing good people who had to be fired because I realized I made a mistake hiring a bunch of people with their skills, not them specifically), mainly on a moral basis rather than a reputation-saving one. However, does doing so make one look weak in the eyes of the Valley VC community? Say you gave everyone something generous, like 3-6 months of severance….would it be hard to raise money later because investors think you don’t have a hard enough heart to run a profitable business?<p>I know this is a relatively stale thread and not a lot of people watching, but very interested to hear thoughts on this.",1425490702

Let&#x27;s think about git, however, as a tool for automating existing workflows, though:<p>Person #1 is a developer. His workflow looks something like  &quot;git fetch public; git checkout -b new-branch public/master; $EDITOR; git commit; git push incoming new-branch&quot;. His &#x27;incoming&#x27; remote goes to a repository of everyone&#x27;s unreviewed feature branches, and each feature is parented from the last commit that was in the public repository.<p>Person #2 is a reviewer. He has two remotes, &quot;incoming&quot; and &quot;reviewed&quot;. His workflow is &quot;git fetch incoming; git checkout incoming/branch-to-review; git log --stat; $VIEWER;  git push reviewed branch-to-review&quot;<p>Person #3 is an integrator who&#x27;s responsible for the state of the &#x27;master&#x27; branch on the &#x27;public&#x27; repository which is visible to everyone. He only wants to merge reviewed branches. His workflow is &quot;git fetch reviewed; git checkout master; git merge reviewed/branch1 reviewed/branch2 reviewed/branch3; $BUILD_AND_TEST; git push public master&quot;.<p>This is the sort of real-world use of Git that goes on in large organizations. It&#x27;s actually harder to think about using Git in a single-developer project, because one person is playing the role of developer/reviewer/integrator, and typically doesn&#x27;t think consciously about what role he&#x27;s in at any one point in time: so his workflow is sort of a mix of all of the above, which ends up being overly complex.<p>Tools like SourceTree really don&#x27;t help the situation either, because they try to give you a graphical interface to git commands in general (since they don&#x27;t have any insight into the development process for a particular project).",1425490342

9145811,comment,9145126,9145126,0,0,AndrewKemendo,,,"I read a lot about how employees get screwed over with stock options, so what we decided to do was to just give employees vesting stock straight up as a buy through.<p>Basically the way this works is that we give new employees an up front lump sum in the amount of how much it costs to purchase the shares of the company. The employee then purchases those shares from us in line with a vesting agreement. All warrants and conversions are exactly the same as the founders shares.<p>This means that they pay tax on this purchase as regular income rather than capital gains up front with the money we give them for it. This prevents a heavy tax bill at conversion and allows them to retain their vested shares regardless of if they work for us or not after the first 12 month vesting period.<p>We calculated that the up front taxes are magnitudes cheaper in the long run because the increased valuation will cover those differences handily and there is no waiting period like there is with capital gains tax.<p>In the end though our intention was to make a simple way for our employees to actually own the stock we give them as compensation and it not be something that they can lose or be restructured easily. If a VC or acquisition wanted to restructure that away for employees then they would be forced to restructure everyone&#x27;s, so we are all in.",1425490097

  * Eighty-five percent of this year’s cases were in people not vaccinated because of religious, philosophical or personal objections, Dr. Schuchat said.
  * Almost half the cases were part of a continuing outbreak in Amish communities in Ohio 
  * In an unusual twist, over half were ages 20 or older. They may have included adults whose parents refused to vaccinate them years ago, she said.
  * Forty-three of the 288 who contracted the virus were hospitalized, most with pneumonia. None died.
  * There were 60 cases in California, mostly in the San Francisco Bay Area and in Orange County, where large numbers of wealthy parents refuse to vaccinate their children.

9145755,comment,9142871,9142871,0,0,JoshDoody,,,"This is a great blog post because it confirms that hiring managers ask wacky questions all the time. (I confess I&#x27;ve done this as well.)<p>I&#x27;m writing a career management guide right now, and one of my chapters is explicitly on this topic (&quot;How to ace your next interview&quot;). I think about this a lot (I&#x27;m a hiring manager, currently building my team, so I&#x27;ve been on both sides of the desk). I break the interview phase down into four phases (Preparation, Pre-interview, Interview, Post-Interview). I think &quot;Preparation&quot; and &quot;Interview&quot; are really appropriate here.<p>Here&#x27;s what I recommend thinking about when preparing for an interview:<p>PREPARATION<p>- Do basic company research. You should understand the basics of the company: what they do, how they make money, how big they are.<p>- Know which job you’re applying for. Read the description a few times to make sure you understand it well.<p>- Know which other jobs the company is trying to fill. You can learn a lot about a company by looking at their job openings. See if you can get a sense of where they’re currently focused and how you can either contribute directly to helping them get there, or how you can contribute indirectly in this job. Take note of other jobs you might be a good fit for, just in case.<p>- Prepare for the dreaded salary question. They’ll probably ask what you’re making now, and what you want to make. I recommend telling them your current salary (because they can probably figure it out anyway), and not telling them your desired salary. For the desired salary piece of the dreaded salary question, I usually say, “I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation.”<p>INTERVIEW<p>- Be early. Don’t keep your interviewer waiting—that’s a horrible way to make a first impression.<p>- Bring a notebook and your resume. You should take notes, and it’s possible your interviewer won’t already have your resume. Be prepared.<p>- Try to relax and be honest during introductions. It’s ok to make small talk for a few minutes so you and your interviewer can get settled in, but don’t spend too much time on this.<p>- Come prepared for different types of questions. Here’s a partial list of common types of questions you may be asked:<p>* Questions about your resume<p>* Questions about you personally<p>* Questions about tools and technology<p>* Technical questions<p>* Questions about your career goals and aspirations<p>* “Why do you want to work here?”<p>* Questions about “a challenging situation”<p>* Questions about special projects or side projects you’ve done<p>- Don’t be afraid to ask for some time to think about your answer. This shows intentionality and may help you formulate better answers to tricky questions. But don’t do this more than a couple times during an interview.<p>- Don’t be caught off guard by crazy questions. If your interviewer asks you something wacky, just gather your thoughts, listen carefully, and formulate the best answer you can. Make sure to account for any constraints that are part of the question as well.<p>- When things start wrapping up, look for opportunities to ask questions to learn more about the company and the role you’re interviewing for. Here are two good questions you can ask if they haven’t been addressed already:<p>* “So what does a typical day look like for this role?”
* “What are the greatest challenges for your team right now?” or “What is the greatest challenge for this particular role?&quot;<p>If both of those questions have already been covered, see if any of your Pre-interview questions might work.<p>- Only ask questions if you can learn new information from them. If you’ve already covered everything in your interview, it’s ok to say, “I think we actually covered everything already!”<p>That&#x27;s a summary of each phase, and the chapter itself goes into quite a bit more detail.<p>You can get the full chapter for free here: <a href=""http://JoshDoody.com/interview?ref=hn4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://JoshDoody.com/interview?ref=hn4</a>",1425489600

To me, that seems kind of silly. I can imagine there a lot of legitimate reasons the Secretary of State would not want their email to be publicly accessible.<p>Security doesn&#x27;t mean everything is inaccessible, it means you control who, when, and where the data can be utilized. Obviously not all of the Secretary of State&#x27;s email should be publicly accessible, but 1) the law as implemented by the government, and not a private individual, should control access, 2) someone needs to ensure control is maintained and prevent unauthorized access, and a private individual probably doesn&#x27;t have the resources to do it.",1425489292

Here&#x27;s the crux of the first argument:<p>1. At the same number of daily transactions, fees must increase 250 folds. Or,<p>2. At the same fee level, transaction count must increase 250 folds. Or,<p>3. Price increases 250 folds to $65000/BTC. Or,<p>4. A combination of all 3<p>#4 seemed like the question answered itself. Instead the author doesn&#x27;t acknowledge #4 at all:<p>&quot;However, neither one of these scenarios is likely to occur. Scenario 1 represents a per transaction fee of $10. Scenario 2 represents 290 transactions per second and close to 25 million transactions per day&quot;<p>The second part of the first argument is comparing Bitcoin costs to credit card costs. What the author is trying to say is that Fiat->XBT, buy something, then XBT->Fiat is more expensive than credit card fees of 3%. But on Coinbase, for example, that would be ~2% in transaction fees and that will only go down as XBT inventory is held and pooled so not every purchase transaction results in a fiat conversion. That&#x27;s only being done now as a bootstrapping strategy (and it seems to be working).<p>I think the author has some good points here but didn&#x27;t seriously address them, only thinly speculated on them. I&#x27;m giving it an up-vote to hopefully have some deeper discussion especially around the first argument of Bitcoin&#x27;s inherent costs.<p>A quick side note: I&#x27;d like to see an analysis of electricity costs of mining vs. mining fees. Mining fees eventually need to surpass electricity costs for mining to be sustainable after inflation-payments are gone. The difference between costs and fees is the margin the miners will make.

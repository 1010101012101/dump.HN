8680493,comment,8679394,8679394,0,0,ThePhysicist,,,"Accuracy aside, from a scientific point of view Interstellar was one of the most interesting movies in a long time, and it really made me think about Physics a lot again.<p>It&#x27;s really cool to see how much you can actually learn about the universe of Interstellar by making use of some Physics knowledge and the information given to you in the movie.<p>An example: The first planet they visit orbits Gargantua (the supermassive black hole mentioned in the movie - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole</a>) at a distance very close to its Schwarzschild radius (or event horizon). In the movie, they say that the time dilation there is such that one hour passed at the surface of the planet corresponds to 7 years (!) on Earth. Interestingly, with that information alone we are already able to calculate how close the planet is to the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole by using a really simple formula: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius</a> (here we have to assume that the black hole is not rotating very fast).<p>Making some assumptions about the mass of the black hole then allows us to see how large the actual Schwarzschild radius is in fact, and if the time dilation shown in the movie is possible (it is). Similarly, if we use the information they give us about the gravity constant on the planet (about 1.3 times Earth gravity if I remember correctly) as well as an estimate of the height of the tidal waves they find there (maybe 200 meters?), we could even estimate the rotation period of the planet.<p>There are many more examples of clues like this in the movie, which offer great &#x27;Fermi problems&#x27; (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem</a>) and allow us to learn many things about the universe presented to us in Interstellar.<p>Of course I also have to mention the absolutely stunning rendering of the black hole, which incorporated the gravitational lensing effects (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens</a>) that make the accretion disk of the black hole appear like a halo surrounding it. Also, the rendering of the wormhole as a four-dimensional &quot;hole&quot; embedded in three-dimensional space was absolutely gorgeous.<p>Amazing movie, amazing science, amazing universe.",1417434496
8680492,comment,8680175,8680175,0,0,wheels,,,"There are a couple of things that have pushed me towards buying more vinyl:<p>- Increased prevalence of bundling high quality MP3 downloads with a vinyl purchase.  Independent artists often do this and (at least in Germany) Amazon&#x27;s autorip also is usually good for vinyl purchases.<p>- Flea markets.  I often find albums I&#x27;d like to own for €3.<p>I kind of have mixed-mode listening -- in the living room, when guests are over, it&#x27;s nicer atmosphere-wise to say, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s plugging in their smartphone to play some track from YouTube; we&#x27;re listening to records.&quot;  But on my own, even when I buy CDs (which I still do) I usually rip them and then listen to them exclusively from my MP3 collection.  With the bundling of vinyl and MP3s, it makes it easy to replace the album that goes in my physical collection (I have several hundred CDs and about 100 records) with an LP, and still get the benefits of having high quality digital music.  For those of us that still have a bit of a fetish for physical collections of things (I like paper books for the same reason), that hits a nice sweet spot.",1417434477

8680490,comment,8677788,8680424,0,0,dalke,,,"Embedded in that is the premise that increasing the number of working hours is a good thing. If the law insists upon a maximum of 30 hours per week, then the number of hours that one is willing to work is no longer a way to distinguish between employees.<p>This thread started with the observation, quoting bato, &quot;as work gets &quot;easier&quot; the way forward would be to reduce hours worked, not increase them&quot;.<p>If you build into your analysis the assumption that working more is better, then of course you&#x27;ll end up with that conclusion that working more is better.<p>You believe there is a negotiation lever by not having a cap in the law. To start with, I would rather have strong unions able to negotiate the cap as appropriate for the given trade. Failing that though, the US has laws limiting the number of hours to work, such as the Libby Zion Law in New York, which limits the amount of resident physicians&#x27; work, and hours-of-service rules for truck drivers.<p>Regarding the maid example, I believe you are suggesting that it&#x27;s rare enough that it can be ignored for purposes of economic analysis. My suggestion is quite different - your justification says that we should not do things that reduce the GDP. I question the primacy of that argument. We make policy decisions to have our country more in the way we want it to be. GDP is easy to measure. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the right metric, or even a good rough gauge.<p>If we wanted a country where people had more time for personal enrichment, then we would have a lower GDP. So what?

If you have accurate understanding of the sensitivity and specificity of a test, then you can take action to maximise the utility of the expected outcome.<p>This means, for example, not necessarily performing a biopsy just because something is there (but it&#x27;s probably benign). The cost of invasive procedures such as biopsies, and risk-increasing tests such as CT scans has to be balanced against their benefits.<p>Of course, there is no risk with a full-body MRI scan. The machine itself is expensive, but otherwise it nominally only costs electricity, maintenance and operation. If full-body scans were, as you say, routine, the cost of the machine would be amortised and an economy of scale should prevail.<p>The problem is legal; if a doctor sees <i>something</i> on a scan and doesn&#x27;t take action, they can be sued.

My preference and long-term bet is definitely on the web - app stores are mostly a tool for locking customers in; they&#x27;re superficially attractive to both customers as devs, but in the long run they&#x27;re also too restrictive for both and too tied to the interests of the app store producers - the Apple app store for example has been used to effectively ban alternative browsers, force Google apps to be second class citizens on the store, stop Amazon from selling ebooks with a buy button in their app, etc, etc - all actions which are in the interests of Apple, but not of customers or developers. That&#x27;s before you get into the problems of rewriting your stack n times because the different platforms want to force you into using their stack to develop with and constantly work to make creating a cross platform product infeasible, with n increasing each time a new device is announced.<p>For all the faults of web development, I also prefer it over having to work within the blessed stack chosen for me by the OS vendor, and being forced to migrate every few years as they decide their old stack isn&#x27;t worth maintaining (secretly I wonder if this constant churn is not also useful to them on some level, it stops app devs every considering other platforms, they&#x27;re running just to stay still). In contrast web development means you can choose your own tools, you are not limited to using javascript <i>if</i> you don&#x27;t subscribe to this latest fad that all logic must be in the front-end written in javascript (which never appeared interesting and unstoppable to me at least), and adhere to the original interfaces of the web which was so dumb and simple it was incredibly powerful:<p>Simple text files (markup, styles) sent over the network to the client, which interprets them in a predictable way to show your UI and data (the predictable part has improved much over the last decade).<p>I do agree with you though that not having a bytecode for the web is a severe restriction on front-end development, and means that I prefer doing backend web work and using js in a limited way for ajax etc, not trying to use it to generate entire documents/UIs. Personally I find JS is fine for limited tasks, but not for writing apps in without quite a lot of pain. I expect that to be addressed at some point soon though, either by asm.js (not optimal), or something like Nacl. Till then, it&#x27;s bliss working in whatever tools I want on the backend, even switching out tools if I want to, without the end user even knowing that I&#x27;m using a different stack - to them what is important is the app, not what it is written in - that is as it should be, and not something you see on other platforms. That&#x27;s the attraction of web development for me, and one that native development will never equal.<p>I disagree that webapps will die - I think they&#x27;ll just evolve and eventually will become universal applications based on HTML. Javascript will die, but not the web. However that is really a political question about how hard OS vendors will push users towards native apps (where they make money both from sales and more importantly from lock-in).<p>Will OS vendors continue to dominate computing? I think that&#x27;s a more interesting question, and one we&#x27;ll see play out over the next few decades. The web may yet reduce native platforms to a set of badly debugged device drivers.",1417433013

If the standard is a 40 hour week then they can offer to work a 50 hour week for example. The only people who they cannot compete with are those already working at full capacity (say a 100 hour work week).<p>They can realise this extra work either as extra wages or by being willing to work more hours for the same wage. This can be used offset other disadvantages that they may have such as a lack of a degree, lack of experience or lack of connections. If a law was passed that restricted the number of hours that people are allowed to work to a maximum then you remove a negotiation lever that some poorer people might want to use.<p>As far as the maid example goes, it is an outlier because the overwhelming majority of women (at least in the west) who are in salaried employment before they are married continue in salaried employment after marriage.

I mostly like vinyl because its half of its own playback device. As a DJ its definitely convenient to be like &quot;oh I spin this thing and it plays whatever the needle is on&quot;. Vinyl makes for a very nice percussion instrument.<p>But guys, the worst thing to have when you are moving or there is a flood or you are broke is vinyl. It&#x27;s heavy, it degrades (in theory it should last, but in practice...), it sells bad. Once you have a dedicated room for your vinyl collection I will believe you when you say you like the format.<p>Imho the future of vinyl should be a &quot;dubplate&quot;-esque existence. Press them to play them, throw em out when you no longer need it. A consumption good. Collecting vinyl is insane, but making use of it is nice. Play it till its dirty and then get rid of it. I need none of the romance that goes with it.<p>I forgot to say: There are genres which rely on vinyl for archival purposes. That&#x27;s right, we don&#x27;t have backups. We need a grand plan for safe keeping past music. There is so much history going away for a fiver... save whats <i>on</i> the vinyl!",1417431780

There were 2 approaches tried 
1) Direct drive approach where weight was comparatively less but the radioactive gases were thrown as exhaust hence was deemed unsafe.
2) Indirect drive (lockheed martin worked on this) which drove the steam turbine which ran the rotors but thrust to weight ratio was so less that it was shelved.<p>Meanwhile there was an internal competition between U.S. airforce and navy for getting a nuclear fueled vehicle that would have unlimited range.

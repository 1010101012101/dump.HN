Apple will wait for the BlackBerry Playbook, which has close to the specs Gruber mentions Apple will need to support the ""iPad retina display"", and see how it affects (1) the price and (2) the battery life of the Playbook. I expect screen size and resolution to be a big differentiator if we ever start seeing the plethora of Android tablets we've been promised as well, which will lead to fanboyism criticizing Apple's decision to leave the iPad's resolution at its current state until 2012.<p>But, if the iPad 3 does have a 'retina display', I expect it will also have battery life and system performance that will make its competitors look silly by comparison.<p>I think Apple, having been <i>first</i> into the tablet market will wait to do that tablet's resolution <i>right</i>.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_PlayBook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_PlayBook</a>",1295416346

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is designed to reduce management complexity without restricting choice or control. You simply upload your application and AWS Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring. AWS Elastic Beanstalk uses highly reliable and scalable services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to deploy your application within minutes. You can also perform most deployment tasks such as changing the fleet size or monitoring your application directly from the AWS Elastic Beanstalk web interface",1295415851
2118786,comment,2118421,2118421,0,0,EGreg,,,"Technically, it's not illegal to sell a GPLed application. The GPL attempts to confer true freedom to whoever has the code. They may do anything with it... except one thing: they can't make it (or any derivative version of it) non GPL and take away the freedom from whoever else gets the code.<p>The question is, should people be prevented from charging money for something that is GPLed and someone else can get it for free? I guess the answer is no. After all, if these guys aren't violating the GPL, anyone can download the program and then offer it on Amazon for a dollar, undercutting them.<p>The real question is, can you make restrictive trademarks etc. around a fork of a GPLed product? I think you are legally allowed to. In this case, you can actually go after people who try to undercut you, on trademark grounds. And if that is the case, you will get a bunch of people who don't realize that there is a free version called something else. Business opportunity for unscrupulous people right there!

No business wants to cannibalize sales or reduce their prices but these results are almost a given with any form of digital distribution. The music industry tried to avoid this and failed miserably and the film industry will suffer the same fate. The place to look for lessons to be learned is possibly in publishing where so far e-books have been introduced at much the same price-point as the paper versions they might replace. This is greatly aided by the proprietary platforms for delivery so it is not clear whether a similar strategy could the pursued. That Netflix exists and is successful makes this unlikely.

In doubling the resolution they provided a seamless user experience.<p>In light of this I was a little surprises theipad introduced both a new aspect ratio and resolution, a resolution not even fully capable of 720p.<p>It really makes me wonder what Apple will do. Will they repeat the iPhone 4 trick and double it this or next year? 2048x1536 does seem rather high.<p>It's possible there will be an altogether different resolution but I rrwally think developers would need 2+ months notice of that to update their appsand get them approved. It wouldn't be as drastic change as the original iPad as that was a totally new form factor but it'll still be a change.<p>So the choices seem to be no change, doubling or new resolution. All have downsides so Apple seems to be in somewhat of a corner.<p>If the iPad 2 is just a CPU/RAM bump to the iPhone 4 and camera, even if a little thinner, I will be disappointed at this point.<p>The originalipad was a huge gamble and I believe it paid off beyond Apple's most optimistic estimates.

Sure, a bunch of students aren't learning because they are slackers, but why there are SO MANY of them? Are there more slackers as a percentage of the population than in the past? Is the internet/cell-phone/facebook era changing the mentality of students to be more focused on the short term easiest/best solution? Or maybe the percent of slackers in the general populace is the same, but a much larger percentage of secondary students go on to undergrad. Well, why are so many more going on in school, especially those that are slackers? Parental/societal pressures might suggest that going to college is just ""what you do"" after high school. Or maybe peer pressure makes students continue in through school because their peers expect it of them. Perhaps it is sheer inertia that is the driving force; our slackers do whatever is the most expedient at the moment, so when the time comes they'd rather go to a generic college with an undecided major than to go and do something.<p>Or, (and I like this theory the most), students feel a need, from an economical perspective, to get a degree in order to get a job. And then they go to school, with the singular goal of earning that piece of paper so they can get a job. At this point, ""slacker"" has been forced into the role by going to school just to be able to get a job afterwards. It's a means to an end, and incidental value is just that. At this point, it isn't just the college's fault, but the general expectations of employers. Why do you require a college degree? Is knowing the theory essential to doing the work or save a substantial amount of training or ramp-up time?",1295414730

Sending a disc round-trip can cost as much as $1, and Netflix mails about 2 million DVDs a day, whereas streaming a movie costs the company about a nickel. “We’re direct to the consumer, so we don’t give half our money to a cable company,” Sarandos says. “Our money goes directly to the content providers.”<p>Some content comes and goes, as in the case with the Timothy Hutton vehicle Leverage, to which Netflix obtained streaming rights through executive producer Dean Devlin. That didn’t sit well with TNT, so when the channel renewed the show for a third season, it made sure to secure digital rights, leaving Netflix with streaming rights to some seasons but not others.<p>“But TNT had to pay a lot more to secure the rights from Dean — it’s exactly why Netflix is exciting for networks and studios,” Sarandos says. “We’re an exciting new buyer in this space. We bid up the price of content.”""</i><p>Eg, Netflix is good for the creators, not so much for the old-economy gatekeepers.",1295413410

And the infrastructure will get rolled out eventually.  The beauty of it is that independent quick-charge stations could literally spring up anywhere the power is already on.  And for the retailers, consumers stuck for 20 or 30 minutes while their car is recharged probably sounds like a dream come true.

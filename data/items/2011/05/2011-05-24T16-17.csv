My apologies for not doing this sooner, but I wanted to wait till there was a resolution to report. And with bureaucracy, that can take time.<p>As expected, I lost the fight to be kept from being defined by the government as a ""business."" However, aided by a capable professional person (reference available on request) who is also a fan of the site, I filed to incorporate etymonline, and did it honestly here in Pennsylvania instead of pretending to be from Delaware to save money, as some corporations do.<p>Then, again with the help of our accounting volunteer, my wife and I refiled our taxes for the year in question, with apporpriate deductions, and managed to erase the bulk of the debt. They even sent us back a check for about $20 in interest. I cherish that like a bartender who gets a dime tip from Scrooge. If this was a shop, that bill would be framed and on the wall.<p>All this should put the site on a solid footing. The non-profit option was tempting, but it turned out to be just not feasible in the current situation. The contributions from supporters got us over the hump.<p>So, etymonline is in business now. That shouldn't make a difference in the site. I anticipate continuing the  Google ads, which, though they led me into this mess, generate sufficient steady income and require no extra work.<p>The next step will be some updating to the mechanics of the site. With a guaranteed income, I can now devote money to paying a professional web designer (who is working at a discount, as a frequent user of the site) to tweak the ""search"" function, make etymonline more friendly to the hand-held devices, and otherwise bring its functionality up to date.<p>Again, thank you personally for your help in getting the site through a trying time.<p>Best wishes,
Doug Harper",1306256367

Often times I can find something to fit my needs right off the bat and every one of the projects provides a great resource for learning.<p>My experience in .NET has been that, while there are communities of developers providing how-tos, tutorials and code samples, the community as a whole is more closed off. I can often find plugin solutions to problems but, in general, it feels like I'd better have my wallet ready.<p>The major difference, I think, is that with .NET you are buying into an entire ecosystem and a pretty expensive one at that. This reduces the impact of the lone developer who is far more willing to share his code.<p>I know you can get into .NET for free/cheap but a lot of the allure is the toolset.",1306256352

I'd expect that as soon as the stock price dipped below the value of the expected discounted dividend stream the smart money would swoop in, and could profit even without having to care about the future stock price.<p>EDIT:  I should point out that this doesn't happen with vicious circles or rising stock prices in any reliable way.  Well, people shorting the stock can have sort of the same effect but not as well.<p>Some companies manage to get by on investor's hope for future huge dividends someday without ever having to issue any right now, like Apple, but I don't think its a loss for society is investors lose their confidence in ""someday"" and start forming their expectation based on past performance.  So I guess I'm saying that to the extent that negative articles can and do drive down a company's stock price those of us who haven't invested in them should be happy.",1306256279

We have management software that meters application utilization. 85% of application runtime on PCs is devoted to: Microsoft Word, Outlook and IE. Most of the other 15% are in-house apps, with a long tail of various tools that people use.<p>Yet the per-seat cost of a desktop is over $100/year for basic licensing, $75/year for Office and about $250/year for hardware, assuming a 4-year refresh cycle. For 10,000 people, that's $4.25M of annual cash flow just to provide clients to workers -- no infrastructure costs, no operational staff costs. (Those costs are easily $50-100/seat, depending on the org)<p>That's a ridiculous amount of money. So there's a huge opportunity to offer a solution that improves productivity by hacking away at that cost. Compare the management features of an iPad/iPhone/BlackBerry to ChromeOS -- they are nearly identical. Lower labor costs plus less licensing means enterprise adoption.

Anyone can say that their software is easy to use, but most people won't believe you.  Apple, Google, 37signals, etc have brands that people <i>trust</i> and people believe that their message will match reality.  I trust Dropbox to work, but no other sync product has built a brand strong enough that I would even bother looking at them.<p>Said another way, brands are an ecosystem of response to a company's product and marketing.  Despite kajillions of dollars spent on advertising, a lot of Microsoft's brand is BSOD, Vista, Clippy and constant restarts.  Despite objective safety numbers and no evidence of failure, people trusted Toyota less, billions of dollars less, when the brake/accelerator ""story"" was happening last year.<p>A brand is what people expect to get.

Is that deception? Intrinsically, why does one bottle of wine cost more than the other? Because it's _better_? What exactly makes one bottle of wine better than the other? It's very subjective.<p>When it comes to products/service that are more quantifiable perhaps the better argument can be made. But that's almost never possible. Businesses distinguish their product/service by other factors that are not easily quantifiable (eg. better customer service, better user experience) that add value.<p>I think deception is the wrong word to use but certainly consumers can save a lot of money by simply being educated about what they're buying (eg. buying the generic version of Claritin/drugs for 60% of the price).",1306256030

Further, that he shouldn't take any credit for thinking through all his decisions and coming up with the more profitable choice enough to substantially beat out millions of other investors?<p>To answer your question, no, we don't laud the winner's coin flipping ability, because, in the absence of cheating, the person's actions and decisions don't influence the outcome. All participants have an exactly equal chance at being the end winner, and nothing will change that. However, some savvy investors, like Warren Buffet, are able to ensure they win over others using the stock market; the difference being that their decision making <i>does</i> directly influence whether they ""win"" or ""lose"".<p>It seems to me you're suggesting investors could use coin flipping to make all investment decisions, and that makes as much sense as trying to decide by other means, since they don't know what they are doing anyway.

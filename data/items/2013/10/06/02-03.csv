You&#x27;re not going to get rich on 0.05% &quot;equity&quot; (inequity?) in some hail-Mary startup, nor are you even going to get the implicitly promised (but rarely delivered) investor contact and the mentoring to be a founder in the next go; get real, the train has left the station. I don&#x27;t know where the next emerging opportunities are, but if you&#x27;re 22 right now and have no inherited connections, the VC-funded nonsense is far along in its decline process that, by the time you&#x27;ll be positioned to take advantage of it, the opportunities will all be gone.<p>Bay Area VC-funded companies are now the conservative, boring choice. They don&#x27;t involve much risk. There&#x27;s almost no upside, because engineers aren&#x27;t respected in that world any more. It&#x27;s what you do if you&#x27;re 22, intelligent, prestige-focused, and can&#x27;t think of anything else. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it, as such-- most 22-year-olds have no clue what the fuck they want to do with their lives, that&#x27;s nearly universal, and it&#x27;s generally not a mark against the person-- but it&#x27;d be better to see more material pointing the young to something that still has real opportunities. VC-istan social climbing ain&#x27;t it. It&#x27;s become like the investment banking analyst program, but instead of getting a bonus every year, you get a get a bonus at &quot;liquidity&quot; <i>if</i> that ever happens-- and if you&#x27;re an engineer, it&#x27;s a mediocre one and you&#x27;d have done better at a hedge fund.<p>If I were just coming out of school, I&#x27;d move to Chicago or Austin before San Francisco, just to avoid the effective debt bondage of exorbitant rents. New York&#x27;s also nice if you&#x27;re into finance, although its tech scene is pretty pathetic.<p>The real goal should be to end the tyranny of location, because it hurts people on both sides. First, it forces people to move out to San Francisco who really don&#x27;t want to be there; that&#x27;s probably half the Bay Area tech industry-- people go for the opportunities that are there, not the place itself. Second, it drives up rents and ruins things for the natives who&#x27;ve lived there forever and love the city-- and it should be given back for them.",1381028084

Instead, the effect is that <i>you can&#x27;t convert Vyvanse into an injectable or smokable form</i> to make it absorb faster. There&#x27;s no simple physical process you can put prodrugs through to turn them into something that will get you high; they need the full biological environment of your liver to be &quot;unlocked&quot;, and it will only do so at a rate safe for you. (Or it&#x27;ll create cytotoxins if you overload it, but this still won&#x27;t get you high.)<p>And because of <i>this</i>, it&#x27;s much safer <i>statistically</i> to prescribe it; with Adderall/Ritalin, there is a high chance that any voluntary self-diagnosed case will turn out to be a junkie/drug-seeker/drug-seller. With Vyvanse/Strattera, that potential for &quot;malicious use&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist[1]. There are still all the same <i>medical</i> dangers, to be judged by doctors on an individual basis -- but there&#x27;s a far lower worst-case downside in prescription.<p>(Further, prodrugs aren&#x27;t addictive when taken at recommended dosages, since addiction is [likely] caused by your brain correlating <i>spikes</i> in its chemistry with recent memories, and prodrugs aren&#x27;t &quot;spiky&quot; in the way their raw agonist or reuptake-inhibitor forms are.)<p>---<p>[1] Well, it does, but only in the nootropic/&quot;study drug&quot; market; not on the street.",1381027664

Think of long multiplication: it assumes you can multiply by a one-digit number, and lets you get from there to multiplying by a many-digit number. This is the same thing, but it only assumes you can multiply by two, instead of by any one-digit number. So this is a variant of long multiplication, and equivalent to performing long multiplication in binary. But it only makes sense if you have a compact representation of your numbers, since otherwise you may indeed just perform the multiplication directly by counting out 7 stones for the first goat, 7 for the next, and so on.<p>It is the version described by Lienhard - which involves counting out the whole number anyway, which you could just as easily do without any special algorithm - that is pointless.",1381027170

She told me about a conference she went to recently, where someone presented an interesting paper.<p>> Apparently, there was an amazing study done relatively recently (last five years), in which they demonstrated that, in mice, exposure to nicotine during pregnancy results in higher rates of ADHD in the grandchildren (passed down through the female offspring exposed to nicotine in utero, not the males).<p>As with any study conducted on animals and not humans, there&#x27;s an asterisk next to it, but these findings would be monumentally significant for understanding ADHD.<p>Separately, I&#x27;ve never understood why Adderall isn&#x27;t approved for use in Europe (or, futhermore, why Vyvanse should be approved, if Adderall isn&#x27;t - Vyvanse is just a more concentrated version of the d-enantiomer, making it more effective[0] and reducing the side-effects).<p>On an unrelated note, it looks like the copy editing on the article was a bit off. Concerta is a long-acting drug, just like Vyvanse (the article makes it seem like it isn&#x27;t).

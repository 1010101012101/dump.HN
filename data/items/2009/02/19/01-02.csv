You are not doing things right if you are not shaking things up and scaring people. That is what disruptive technology is about.<p>Many startups face similar challenges and this reminds me of the struggles ones such as GlassesDirect.co.uk had to go through before becoming successful (they could have been crushed many times by Goliaths but fought through) - it had to close several times when major competitors and retailers tried to sabotage its business by forcing manufacturers/suppliers to drop GlassesDirect (else they would withdraw their vastly larger orders) and running smear campaigns in the press with false allegations about why using the service was illegal and substandard.<p>In this case, yes, content providers have a right to choose where/how their content is shown, but this is probably more to do with not getting licensing fees from Boxee than anything else. However, if they do not adopt/embrace legal methods such as Boxee (and insert extra adverts etc. to make the revenue they want), then they only encourage illegal methods.<p>---<p><i>Concerted efforts to sabotage the new venture have proved fruitless.

486536,comment,485701,485906,0,0,patio11,,,"This may sound like a mini-rant, if so my apologies in advance:<p>I work at a software company in central Japan.<p>On a day to day basis Japan is a lot like England, with rather less white people and much more expensive cheese.  The language is a language, the people are people, the business challenges are business challenges, and it is all rather less exotic than people make it out to be.  But I get the ""of all places"" vibe a lot whereas I don't think I'd get it if I worked for a big ol' publicly traded firm in London.<p>Its not exactly rocket science getting a job here.  We have big freaking companies which do lots of business with international customers.  This is sort of a necessary prerequisite for being an economy of Japan's size.<p>Many of these companies have significant need for IT.  The percentage of local engineers who can speak English is truly abysmal -- not quite as bad as the number of American engineers who can speak Japanese, but its still far below the requirements of industry.  So when you need an English-speaking engineering services, how do you get it?  The same way Japan gets every other resource they can't make locally: buy it from abroad.<p>Step one to getting a job as a professional here: achieve proficiency in the Japanese language, where proficiency means ""I can read a design document written in Japanese and extract the business requirements from it, then defend my implementation choices in oral Japanese to my colleagues"" and not ""I watched anime and learned some phrases すごいよね"".<p>Sidenote from my personal version of hell: Imagine the worst tech interview you have ever participated in.  Now imagine that the interviewee has less working vocabulary than a second grader.  Now imagine he is damned proud of it.<p>Its difficult but a lot less impossible than routinely made out to be.  I recommend studying at university, if you have the opportunity.<p>Step 2: Network.  This primarily consists of figuring out a way to get your business card into the hands of someone who will be asked the question ""Do you know of any engineers who speak English?""  The ROI on a set of $20 bilingual business cards is truly stupendous.  There are hundreds of Japanese companies with business in America, hundreds of American companies with business in Japan, and tens of thousands of people routinely flying between the two countries on business.  These might be good folks to chat up.  You have a built-in edge because people who are bilingual in English and Japanese are rare and people who are bilingual AND can perform as developers are as rare as hen's teeth.<p>Technical skill is also a requirement, obviously, for engineers -- exactly what technical skill depends on the particular industry and company's requirements are.  I'm hired to write CRUD apps for universities, not to work for some amorphous Japan, Inc.  The most popular developer job in my town, on the other hand, is writing embedded software for cars.

Adobe Reader and Java are the nearest competitors and the install base is much lower.<p>Why? Initially - download size. For several years (while most people were still on dial-up) the Flash plugin was kept under 200K. Macromedia deliberately kept the plugin as small as possible so that it wasn't a burden to install it. They did internal testing where they artificially increased the size of the plugin and there was an immediate drop in download numbers. At some point as the size increased, the numbers would drop dramatically and they'd know that was the limit they had to work to when adding new features. Upgrades and installation was always kept as easy as possible.<p>They then cemented the install base with video playback that didn't act like it was stapled onto the browser. Prior to Flash with video, all the web based video options were clunky and almost completely closed to customization. Until there is an open standard for video playback, supported across all browsers, I think Flash will remain ubiquitous.<p>I can't see Silverlight taking over. It's not cross platform for a start. 3D isn't enough reason for people to install it and, other than Microsoft, no self respecting web site wants to risk alienating users by forcing an install.<p>Disclosure - I used to work for Macromedia. So I'll freely admit some bias!",1235005568

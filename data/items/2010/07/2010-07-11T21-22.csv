But a lot of presales people are not tech people - they are product people. And these people can make the transition to sales well.<p>What I'd add to your list above is passion. The best sales team are those that really believe in what they are selling. Of course, great sales people can sell anything even when it's rubbish - but for that you need a superstar sales person. For mere mortals passion is key - and that often comes from those who knew the product inside out- ie SE.<p>What I haven't mentioned is those that made the SE transition to sales very much left SE behind. They could do their own demos but they don't. They need to transition to all the stuff you have above. But if you can retain the product passion - and the marketing/benefits/product knowledge background, you have a good advantage.",1278885535

Ari Gold can't act, and a top salesperson might barely know how to use the product. From what I've seen, effective salespeople:<p>* Are persistant and laser-focused on getting deals to close.<p>* Can turn off every part of their brain that would prevent or delay them from asking for the sale.<p>* Have a nose for the org chart and for figuring out who needs to be sold to how.<p>* Can accurately gauge where they are in the sales process for any prospect, engagement, or eval --- this rarely has anything to do with technology and usually has everything to do with budgeting, MBO's, and getting bakeoffs started.<p>* Take meetings and make visits relentlessly.<p>* Appear confident, like the guy-in-the-rated-R-movie.<p>Most of this isn't helped by product knowledge, and some of it is actively hindered by in-depth knowledge (for instance, by creating doubts about whether now's the right time to ask to close a deal with someone considering or evaluating).<p>I always sound like I know exactly what I'm talking about, and often I don't, so don't hesitate to tell me I'm wrong; I'll learn from it.

1506194,comment,1503137,1504069,0,0,rwl,,,"Actually, a lot of contemporary philosophy -- at least as it is practiced in the English-speaking world -- strives for exactly the ""plain, clear, specific definitions"" and ""verifiable logic"" you're looking for.  I think the overgeneralizations and nebulous explanations you refer to are more typical of ""Continental"" philosophy and related disciplines like ""critical theory.""<p>The former style of philosophy does produce work that is clearer and easier to read, but it has its own limitations: in the worst cases, philosophers get so hung up on being clear that they shy away from discussing the difficult problems that bring people to philosophy in the first place, and instead spend their careers arguing over minutiae or practicing pseudo-science.  Clear definitions aren't going to provide you with the final word on how to treat others, how to organize society, what really exists, or how we know about it.<p>Then again, the latter style of philosophy doesn't necessarily do much better on addressing these ""big questions.""  Sometimes it is better at keeping these questions in view, but (as you point out) it is often extremely esoteric.<p>The best philosophers, I think, understand that clear definitions are a starting place, a model that needs to be developed.  They see that model as a tool for addressing the thorny, complicated, and tangled questions that philosophers are asked to answer, not as a truth that must be defended in its own right.  The goal is to find real philosophical truths.  Where a rigorous, methodical approach helps us attain that goal, it should be welcomed; but where that approach becomes a hindrance, it should be left behind.",1278884596

1506175,comment,1505792,1506081,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Yes. I agree, with this addition.<p>American Democracy is about the consent of the governed. It always has been. If you read both the Federalist Papers and the people who were arguing the other side, it's quite clear that the anti-Federalists had some really good points. Many of the predictions they made about the future course of the country were proven correct. Their arguments caused so much concern that a Bill of Rights was a precondition to adoption of the Constitution.<p>There has always been two strains of thought in America. Strain 1 says that people should be led by their betters. Heck, even Jefferson privately acknowledged that there is a natural aristocracy among men. These people feel that with the right people in charge, working the right system, the sky is the limit. If things are wrong, it's a problem of not having the right person. Government consists of doing whatever it takes to make the quality of people's lives better.<p>Strain 2 feels that all systems of government are broken, mainly because it's impossible to have a government that doesn't involve men, and men are fallible. I agree that this has some religious roots, but it also has roots in a study of history. As Thomas Paine pointed out -- not the religious person by any means! -- a man who has a king for a tyrant knows who oppresses him. But a man who is a serf to a complex system of bureaucrats is just as oppressed, only he has nobody to point a finger at. Strain 2 believes that every time structure is added, the system becomes more and more broken. That even if you had a super smart person, they'd more as likely be a dictator than a savior. Government consists of doing as little as possible to prevent people from harming each other.<p>This fight continues today. The constitution was a compromise between these two strains of thought. That's why it's worked for so long. Good government consists of a balance between these two schools of thought, with some kind of reset option every now and then when the system gets too much cruft in it(in my opinion)<p>So Joe Sixpack who knows nothing votes, but he votes instead of marching in the street with guns. Clyde Wineglass (Joe's cousin who went to Harvard) votes, and by voting he also blows off steam. The major parties exist solely for giving the illusion that things are changing every few years, which makes Joe and Clyde feel better about voting. Over time, each of them builds up a long narrative about how their party almost did this or that, but the other party stopped them. By having a ""good"" party and a ""bad"" party in their mind, each of them is able to deal with their frustrations about government without actually becoming angry with the government. This allows our civilization to continue.<p>It's interesting to observe how different the idea of parties (or ""factions"" as I think Madison called them) turned out to be compared to what the founders thought would happen. Sometimes you get it right even when you screw up :)<p>Sorry if that was a little cynical, but that's the way I currently understand it. And I agree with grellas, these guys are off-base. This entire line of science-of-irrationality, as it applies to politics, is a threat to this system of consent, because it threatens to put people in boxes.

I have read a few science articles claiming the price of distillation is coming down and a viable alternative than pumping water great distances.<p>I can't find the one from Popular Science, but I did a quick google search and found this article. Though, I don't know its accuracy.<p>from <a href=""http://www.freedrinkingwater.com/water_quality/quality1/1-make-seawater-drinkable.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freedrinkingwater.com/water_quality/quality1/1-ma...</a><p><i>Here's a few reasons why...Seawater provides an unlimited, reliable water supply for coastal populations worldwide; brackish water is a plentiful, relatively drought-proof water resource for inland populations and reduces dependency on imported water. And, of all the Earth's water, 97 percent is salt water, only 1 percent is fresh water available for humans to drink, and 2 percent is frozen. Of the more than 7,500 desalination plants in operation worldwide, 60% are located in the Middle East. The world's largest plant in Saudi Arabia produces 128 MGD of desalted water. In contrast, 12% of the world's capacity is produced in the Americas, with most of the plants located in the Caribbean and Florida.</i><p><i>To date, only a limited number of desalination plants have been built along the California coast, primarily because the cost of desalination is generally higher than the costs of other water supply alternatives available in California (e.g., water transfers and groundwater pumping). However, as drought conditions occur and concern over water availability increases, desalination projects are being proposed at numerous locations in the state. Desalination costs are decreasing as technology improves and more plants are built. Today there are more than 15,000 desalination plants in 120 countries. The desalination market is forecast to grow more than $70 billion in the next 20 years. About half of the world's desalted water is produced with heat to distill fresh water from seawater.</i>",1278883775

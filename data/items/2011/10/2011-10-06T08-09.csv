We are persons, we have minds. We have developed into something that goes beyond the substrate from which we came and we owe it to ourselves to some day outgrow the need for that substrate completely.<p>Imagine what our minds could do if they had centuries to develop. Imagine what our culture could be like if we didn't have to start from scratch every 70 years. Imagine a society without loss and scarcity. I know it's not an idea that appeals to a lot of people, but it does appeal to me. And I do believe it's an inevitable next step. In the end, it doesn't matter what most people think of this idea. It's not a development that the majority of humanity has to sign off on - we'll just move along without you, no harm done.",1317891447

3079477,comment,3078128,3078564,1,0,paganel,,,"> Death is not good; it is very bad. If given the opportunity to live ""forever"" (and not age), you'd take it. In a world without death, nobody would think introducing it was a good idea. But because we currently can't do anything about it, we try to tell ourselves it's a good thing.<p>That doesn't explain self-sacrifice. And, honestly, I wouldn't want to live an ""eternal"" life when everybody I love and know around me would be dead at some point or another. Maybe this is also why I've come to see Christianity's  ""promise"" of eternal life as ridiculous and almost scary at times.<p>As Seneca used to say, it doesn't matter how long you live, it's what you do with your life that matters (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Brevitate_Vitae_%28Seneca%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Brevitate_Vitae_%28Seneca%29</a>)<p>""""""
The philosopher brings up many Stoic principles on the nature of time, namely that men waste much of it in meaningless pursuits. According to the essay, nature gives man enough time to do what is really important and the individual must allot it properly. 
""""""<p>And to finish in an even more pathetic tone, I don't think we should strive for living an eternal life, but rather do what Julius Caesar did when he realized that Alexander had already conquered the world by 30: weep, and then try to conquer the world by ourselves.",1317891157

For chiropractic to be valid they need to be able to prescribe a specific treatment to a specific condition for a patient. If the prescription is valid then if the patient undergoes a different manipulation it shouldn't have the same effect. If it does then the idea that it was that specific manipulation is potentially invalidated.<p>See: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10519559"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10519559</a><p>You could actually even double blind it by having one chiropractor diagnose and prescribe treatment, and then have that treatment randomised so it was either done as prescribed or substituted for a sham treatment. That treatment would then be administered by a second chiropractor who was unaware of the diagnosis and not allowed to speak to the patient about it or modify the treatment.<p>Even if that was too complex or otherwise flawed a properly constructed single blinded RCT trial is still valid evidence, even if it's not the best of the best.",1317890725

People making an actual effort for their reward, and having fun doing it. The effort made (playing the game) is something I feel strongly about, especially as companies freely customize the deal offered. This amongst others means that the company is able to track what people are prepared to do for what. I know this is sweetened by the fact that they're playing games, and different games have different effort levels. I feel this will be much more effective than low-ball dealsites like groupon. I have my feelings regarding groupon, which almost anonymizes the actual vendor, leaving them feeling raped by the scavanger-like clientele, only looking for the cheapest possible, I am talking from personal experience having launched a few campaigns.<p>As the the businesses in article state;<p>""We prefer Dobango over other sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, because Dobango has helped bring in higher quality customers that are more likely to come back rather than clients looking for one time low-ball deals, who are not likely to become repeat customers.""<p>This is where the money's at.<p>User adoption is incredibly important. However, having a community with a large userbase, you have a responsability to keep them happy. To do so, having an inventory/product/service to offer your users is what will keep them coming back, ergo, keeping your suppliers happy is equally important.<p>Groupon is great, but me in my expertise as a marketing manager/consultant, the cost of marketing was far too great, and the clientele produced wouldnt really come back again to our hotel. I'm sure groupon works for businesses that can support that high level of discount, such as established franchises and larger corporations, but our hotel, with 15 in staff and 30 rooms, could never run more than one promotion every quarter. It creates a scavangerlike mentality, which is great for groupon but useless for the businesses. Its appealing to the most basic of their animal instincts cheap=awesome. Its a cheap form of marketing that I highly dissapprove of. I could make a lot more money just telling every single client I've worked with to slash prices and simply undercut the competition, but this is no way of driving innovation forward. You want to create more business, innovate and sell at higher price. Perpetually pricing yourself lower than your competition will eventually leave you like one of the now many defunct, outdated and out-right shitty hotels populating the Cancun beaches.

Cancer is subject to epidemiological trends suggesting that there are definite causes related to lifestyle or the environment.<p>3. You can reduce your risk of cancer/dying of cancer by not smoking, exercise, maintaining a normal body weight, and participating in screening programs. There are no guarantees of course.<p>4. Some cancers are curable eg testicular cancer can be cured even if widespread, with chemotherapy. Also Hodgkin's lymphoma and of course early stage cancer of the breast and bowel.<p>Incidentally, Steve Jobs had a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, which is distinct from the normal run of the mill pancreatic cancer that has a poorer prognosis.",1317888217

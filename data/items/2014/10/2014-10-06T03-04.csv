8414248,comment,8414180,8414180,1,0,simoncion,,,"> As recently as 2013, a leading file systems developer was still arguing that file systems didn’t have to save file data reliably by mocking users for playing computer games.<p>Tso neither mocks users for playing games, nor argues that filesystems should not be required to be reliable. He says:<p>&quot;[Lortie, that filesystem operation that you said was guaranteed to be safe actually isn&#x27;t safe. You mis-read the docs. It&#x27;s racy, and here are the two races that you could lose. Losing both could lose your data. Here&#x27;s an analogy to illustrate the races: ]<p>The failure scenario would probably be something like the user who plays tux racer all the time, and uses crappy proprietary drivers that crash the system every single time an OpenGL application exits. If they think that&#x27;s normal, and are willing to live with the crap proprietary drivers, and they are also the sort of people who carefully position all of their windows to be precisely just so, and if the !@#!?! desktop libraries are still bogusly rewriting the entire contents of every single registry file, regardless of whether the application changed anything --- then eventually, said user will whine about how the hours she spent obsessively setting up their window layout got lost after Tux Racer creashed (sic) their system <i>again</i>.&quot;<p>Notice the carefully constructed persona used in the illustration:<p>* Tolerates terrible, crashy, OpenGL drivers.<p>* Makes use of the OpenGL drivers by playing a video game.<p>* Spends a lot of time meticulously positioning application windows.<p>* Uses a WM that stores application window position in a single file that gets updated all the damn time for no reason at all.<p>* Whines when the enormous amount of work put into positioning windows gets wasted when the poorly-designed software they&#x27;re using crashes and takes some of their data with it.",1412567895

8414237,comment,8414055,8414055,1,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> But increased interest rates or a sudden stock-market chill could slam on the brakes.<p>ZIRP <i>will</i> end. The stock market will <i>not</i> continue to be an easy source of double-digit annual returns forever.<p>The question is always timing, but anybody who is following the Fed and looking at the action in the market can tell you that we&#x27;re closer to the end of the current environment than we are to the beginning. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean a meltdown is coming (it&#x27;s of course a real possibility), but even modest changes that inflict minimal pain overall could have significant implications for the startup scene.<p>For all of the genuinely smart, successful people in the Bay Area, I&#x27;m constantly amazed at how few people here seem to be looking at how the broader environment has made the most recent boom possible. Mention ZIRP and the majority of people will ask &quot;What do they do?&quot; thinking ZIRP refers to a hot new startup.<p>> More worrisome, Mr. Moeller says, are startups with small teams looking for massive spaces and locking themselves in to long leases. Startups are signing five- to seven-year leases on spaces that used to require two, and more landlords are pushing for 10-year leases on new construction. Those could become a burden if financing tightens.<p>Generally speaking, the landlords are far savvier than the entrepreneurs they&#x27;re leasing to. They&#x27;re not pushing 10 year leases to help tenants lock in a good deal.<p>> Mr. Altman says he met a few months ago with an entrepreneur who drove up in a new Porsche sport-utility vehicle. The man’s startup had completed a $10 million early round of financing the previous week. Mr. Altman says he looked at him sternly, asking him, “What message do you think you’re sending to the rest of the company?”<p>The message the entrepreneur is sending to his employees is irrelevant. If there&#x27;s anything of importance in this anecdote, it&#x27;s what such behavior says about the mindset of some of the founders investors are lavishing with millions of dollars of investment.",1412567591

At least she has a very impressive resume and is fully qualified. EDIT: And you imply that people with the opinion in #1 caused that to happen; it&#x27;s very hard to believe that is true or that they even have the influence to affect the choice of HP&#x27;s CEO.<p>3) The necessary assumptions behind #1 and #2 make your statement read as if you believe there is some sort of conspiracy favoring women in tech and you are pushing against it. I&#x27;m not saying you believe that, but the argument looks that way.<p>If there is a conspiracy to promote women in tech, it is doing very poorly.<p>I agree with this statement: Cultural changes don&#x27;t happen overnight.",1412567258

8414217,comment,8414078,8414165,1,0,vladd,,,"You could use other definitions, such as picking an arbitrary number of years and call anything younger than that a startup. But maintaining a high growth explains so many aspects of a startup&#x27;s life (why founders give up parts of their company to investors, why most are focused in technology etc) that it seems any other way of looking at it would be misleading at best. Why would a 6-month restaurant be called a startup if it&#x27;s not designed ever to scale beyond its neighborhood, or why would you no longer call a startup something that keeps growing weekly at 5%?<p>>> If you want to understand startups, understand growth. Growth drives everything in this world. Growth is why startups usually work on technology—because ideas for fast growing companies are so rare that the best way to find new ones is to discover those recently made viable by change, and technology is the best source of rapid change. Growth is why it&#x27;s a rational choice economically for so many founders to try starting a startup: growth makes the successful companies so valuable that the expected value is high even though the risk is too. Growth is why VCs want to invest in startups: not just because the returns are high but also because generating returns from capital gains is easier to manage than generating returns from dividends. Growth explains why the most successful startups take VC money even if they don&#x27;t need to: it lets them choose their growth rate. And growth explains why successful startups almost invariably get acquisition offers. To acquirers a fast-growing company is not merely valuable but dangerous too. <<",1412566933

These municipal areas show the pattern:<p>Bakoor City ( <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Bacoor+City,+Cavite,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Bacoor+City,+Cavite,+Ph...</a> )<p>City of Las Piñas ( <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/City+of+Las+Piñas,+Metro+Manila,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/City+of+Las+Piñas,+Metr...</a> )<p>Parañaque ( <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Parañaque,+Metro+Manila,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Parañaque,+Metro+Manila...</a> )<p>Taguig ( <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Taguig,+Metro+Manila,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Taguig,+Metro+Manila,+P...</a> )<p>Muntinlupa ( <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Muntinlupa,+Metro+Manila,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Muntinlupa,+Metro+Manil...</a> )<p>City of San Pedro ( <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/City+of+San+Pedro,+Laguna,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/City+of+San+Pedro,+Lagu...</a> )<p>Dasmariñas City ( <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Dasmariñas+City,+Cavite,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Dasmariñas+City,+Cavite...</a> )<p>---<p>I could keep going but Dasmariñas City shows another interesting pattern, the suburb names are pretty generic, such as:<p>BGY Zone I - B ( <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Bgy.+Zone+I+-+B,+Dasmariñas+City,+Cavite,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Bgy.+Zone+I+-+B,+Dasmar...</a> )<p>Area 1 ( <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Area+1,+Dasmariñas+City,+Cavite,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Area+1,+Dasmariñas+City...</a> )<p>Area 3 ( <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Area+3,+Dasmariñas+City,+Cavite,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Area+3,+Dasmariñas+City...</a> )<p>Area B ( <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Area+B,+Dasmariñas+City,+Cavite,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Area+B,+Dasmariñas+City...</a> )<p>Area C ( <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Area+C,+Dasmariñas+City,+Cavite,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Area+C,+Dasmariñas+City...</a> )<p>Area G ( <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Area+G,+Dasmariñas+City,+Cavite,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Area+G,+Dasmariñas+City...</a> )<p>Area K ( <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Area+K,+Dasmariñas+City,+Cavite,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Area+K,+Dasmariñas+City...</a> )<p>Some interesting things like Area 2 and Area B not being present seem conspicuous but not necessarily a pattern, these names are so generic its entirely possible they represent some kind of placeholder policy.<p>---<p>Edit 2:<p>Open Street Map shows the same names. Definitely looking deliberate, possibly a historical quirk of some kind that i haven&#x27;t been able to unearth through Google translate and searching for Filipino phrases to do with road naming.<p>Further down [1] it was suggested that this is some kind of new development, implying a property manager just named them all in a batch. Well, the fact that the open street map data clearly shows &quot;Chicago&quot;[2] and &quot;Atlanta&quot;[3] located in the very heart of Manilla&#x27;s industrial port district. This makes it rather hard to consider a &#x27;new development&#x27; as an option.<p>Further, to this, Chicago shows up as the first discrepancy in these names which may lead to some answers. The southern end of &#x27;Chicago&#x27; doesn&#x27;t match up to what Google displays when you view this [4] area on Google maps. It shows &#x27;Chicago&#x27; as &quot;Delgado St&quot;, and the southern disconnected street is also called &quot;Delgado St&quot; which in the OSM data shows up as &quot;Antonio C. Delgado&quot;[5].<p>From the look of it, some of these names may be attributable to mistakes, but the underlying question of where these seemingly place holder names originate, remains unanswered.<p>---<p>Edit 3:<p>The seemingly weird names are widespread, subsections of the old section of Manila, the Tondo district, are utterly awash with oddness, several dozen marks consisting of just numbers, are evident here on this map level on google maps [6]<p>Moving further away, I find &quot;Sunshine&quot;[7], and &quot;2.91km&quot;[8] in Quezon City. 2.91km also seems to give Google grief as the name seems to be incorrectly handled on that street, with most of the north end labeled as &quot;2.91km&quot; and the south end &quot;Saint Martin&quot; but when you zoom in, Google starts overlaying both names and the north end isn&#x27;t recognized as &quot;2.91km&quot; when you ask Google what&#x27;s at the location.<p>---<p>Spreading the net wide over the whole country, the names from the northernmost end, at Basco show a difference when viewed in OSM[9] vs Google maps[10]. Google displays the names with &quot;St&quot; added to most of them, all the roads are marked the same on these maps, but on OSM, all the street names lack a suffix indicating as such. Moving south, the names in Calayan on the island of Cagayan seem to lack names on both OSM and Google Maps. Continuing south to the main island, the town of Aparri shows the same pattern on Google[11] and OSM[12] with OSM having no street suffixes.<p>---<p>Jumping all the way south now, Digos City demonstrates this weirdness nice and clearly. We find &quot;Luna&quot; in Google[13] and OSM[14] with Google not even having the label. Moving around some more, we go to &quot;Apple&quot; in South Cotabato, on Google[15] and OSM[16]. I could keep browsing but I&#x27;ve run out of time to keep digging for now, at least I&#x27;ve ruled out &#x27;local quirk&#x27; and found evidence the pattern is evident across the entire Philippines.<p>Speculatively, if there was no native history of naming routes back before Spanish and then later American rule, or the colonial governments simply didn&#x27;t care for the native names, its entirely possible that with thousands of streets and roads lacking names or names they could pronounce, early colonial governments merely went over the map and gave each of them one, the mindset of &quot;cant govern what you cant name&quot; being present throughout history, government wanting to be able to refer to places by name in various reports and meetings effectively requiring them to find a way to give all these a name. However this doesn&#x27;t really cover what are clearly relatively modern urban roads, such as &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;Atlanta&quot; found in the port district of Manila, which leaves this theory with a few shortcomings.<p>---<p>---\n1 - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8414256"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8414256</a><p>2 - <a href=""http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/29170930"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/29170930</a><p>3 - <a href=""http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/16176658"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/16176658</a><p>4 - <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Manila,+Metro+Manila,+Philippines/@14.5896406,120.9673723,19z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3397ca03571ec38b:0x69d1d5751069c11f?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Manila,+Metro+Manila,+Phil...</a><p>5 - <a href=""http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/16176619"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/16176619</a><p>6 - <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/@14.6128113,120.9634945,15z?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/@14.6128113,120.9634945,15z?h...</a><p>7 - <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Sunshine,+Quezon+City,+Metro+Manila,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Sunshine,+Quezon+City,+...</a><p>8 - <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/2.91KM,+Quezon+City,+Metro+Manila,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/2.91KM,+Quezon+City,+Me...</a><p>9 - <a href=""http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/198496785"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/198496785</a><p>10 - <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Port+Rd,+Basco,+Batanes,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Port+Rd,+Basco,+Batanes...</a><p>11 - <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Aparri,+Cagayan,+Philippines/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Aparri,+Cagayan,+Philip...</a><p>12 - <a href=""http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/198505523"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/198505523</a><p>13 - <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/@6.7474661,125.3659606,18z?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/@6.7474661,125.3659606,18z?hl...</a><p>14 - <a href=""http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/97401719"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/97401719</a><p>15 - <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Apple,+General+Santos,+South+Cotabato,+Philippines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Apple,+General+Santos,+...</a><p>16 - <a href=""http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/60237885"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/60237885</a>",1412566049

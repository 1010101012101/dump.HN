One part I love about Ruby is being able to drop into an irb/pry session nearly instantly or run the Rails console and test out code and ideas interactively and being able to quickly restart the dev server if configs change. JRuby has always been appealing to me but it's kind of annoying to use for development due to the JVM startup time. I used to do Java development full time and had the same annoyance with needing the compilation/restart step to see changes.<p>Does Clojure address this problem or are there workarounds (like Guard/Spork for testing in Rails)? Is there anything fundamentally different from JRuby that would alleviate the slow restarts, or am I simply thinking about the problem wrong?",1347292681

You could argue that even protein binding sites that have no biological outcome titrate away transcription factors from other ""active"" regions. The system would have evolved with these sinks in place and therefore they constitute an active, useful part of the genome. Another way to look at it is that if you were trying to generate a computer model of the entire genome, you would have to account for the extra binding sites, even if they had no output in terms of protein or even RNA.",1347292473

But, in that case, you almost never see a broken website running on its primary database. Inevitably, the site has already tried failing over to the secondary before it gives up and yells for help.<p>On the one hand, this is not a good thing, because if you've got a problem that's unrelated to the database (e.g. too much traffic is choking up your supply of DB connections) and then you do a failover, now you have two problems - or, at least, more moving parts to sort out before the situation is resolved. So it's tempting to design a more clever failover scheme. But, on the other hand, cleverness is itself a risk: Not only might your clever algorithm have an even-more-clever pathological failure mode, but it's harder to understand in an emergency. When your stuff is broken, simplicity is your friend. All else being equal, you don't want your front-line emergency responder to have to understand complex failover logic. There is nobody more frustrated than an ops engineer who can't make the system use the primary database because some stupid bot keeps forcing the use of the secondary, or vice versa. In the heat of battle, they're liable to comment out your clever bot and replace it with a one-line shell script.<p>Engineering is a difficult balancing act.",1347291782

Or when someone posts a copy for free download by complete strangers on the internet?  That seems to bring no benefit whatsoever to the initial producer.  (It's possible that the video or picture could come with ""Made by <name>, send donations here"" or something, but I'm sure that's not the case most of the time.)  Would you be in favor of legalizing free online distribution of unattributed child pornography, then?  If so, please recognize that this is at odds with existing laws (although your position would at least be self-consistent).  If not, please explain yourself.<p><i>Also, the owning of the object e.g. ivory is not illegal; the selling is illegal, right? So a little off the mark there.</i><p>I see, you're right.  But the effects--ruling out legal producers as competition, and raising the price on the black market--are still the same kind, just probably less pronounced and less likely to catch civilians in the crossfire.  And, again, it seems to mean that your argument doesn't support the criminalization of possessing or freely distributing child porn.  (Also, no objections to child porn whose production demonstrably caused no harm to the child?  Perhaps you'd even assent to ""the burden of proof is on the prosecutor to establish that a child was harmed"", rather than ""the burden of proof is on the producer to establish there was no harm"".)",1347291158

The first message is clearly highlighted and all replies are shown as comments.
If you enter the site for the first time you see nothing. Maybe there must appear a friends-suggestion. 
If you search for friends you get a list of whom you received mails and whom you wrote mails. If you add them as friends all mails between you and your new friend appear in your stream. The other one will not get informed, that's not necessary.
You can comment or reply to every message. If you comment your own message the receivers of the message you comment on will get your new comment as email.
If you reply to someone else message, the sender and the other receivers will get your comment.
The idea is not to force other people to use this system. If it fits for me, that's enough. The others will get my messages as regular mails and their mails got to my message-stream. There is no media break. 
Maybe the outgoing mail is styled so the receiver notices that I use a very interesting system and want to try this himself.
An idea for the future is to send hidden information within the outgoing mails. If two friends use this platform to communicate and maybe they hit the ""like""-Button for a message or picture this information can be send afterward with your next email to this person. His system will get informed to display the ""like""-info.
To avoid privacy concerns I though of making this open-source so that everyone can install this on an own secure server. But what about those who do not have the skills to install a php-script with database-interaction? Maybe a standalone-php2exe-version can help?<p>What are your ideas about this? Is it to fail?

We then used that info and went through a redesign using backbone/node/etc. That brings us to the current v2 that is now live.<p>The point of HouseFix is to provide a simple interface to track the home improvement or home maintenance projects that you need to complete. You can upload pictures of the current state of the project, pictures of what you want it to look like, and then the community can share insights and ideas about your project. Once we get enough people using it, the idea is that you could also open the project up to bids for contractors to provide ideas / estimates for your project. We have 10k+ registered users and are tracking engagement to see where there are issues with the UI/UX and see where we can optimize the funnel.<p>Would love to get some feedback from the wisdom of HN on ways we could improve any part of the site and/or things we may have overlooked regarding user flow.<p>Thanks",1347289268

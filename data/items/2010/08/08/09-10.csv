1585131,comment,1584988,1585111,0,0,barrkel,,,"For the HDD route, I'd probably prefer lower density storage, heaps of redundancy, and a good spread of HDD manufacturers.<p>A quick Google of HDD MTBF suggests that 1 million hours (over a century) is wildly optimistic, and typical failure rate is 2-4% per year, possibly as high as 13%. If e is the failure rate (as a fraction of 1), and assuming a constant and independent failure rate over time, then the survival chances for any one drive are:<p><pre><code>    (1 - e)^50\n</code></pre>\nSo the chance that any one will fail is:<p><pre><code>    1 - (1 - e)^50\n</code></pre>\nWith n mirrors (assuming a reliable checksum to verify data in the event of only a single copy of a mirror surviving), the chances of all failing, f, are:<p><pre><code>    f = (1 - (1 - e)^50)^n\n\n    log(f) = n log(1 - (1 - e)^50)\n\n    n = log(f) / log(1 - (1 - e)^50)\n</code></pre>\nSo, for a reliability of 99.999%, and hoping you can keep the individual yearly failure rate at 3%, so f=0.00001 and e=0.03, n would need to be at least 47.",1281261120

1585129,comment,1584019,1584019,0,0,ww520,,,"It's a radical idea, on the same level of jumping from monolithic kernel to micro kernel system.<p>The main idea is to use a safe language (Java/C#) to provide process isolation instead of relying on the OS imposing separate process address space.<p>Safe language codes can be proved that they do no harm, cannot corrupt another program (the bytecode verifier will stop it).  For the unsafe language programs (C/ASM), the current way to prevent them from stepping on each other is by putting them in separate address space processes with limited privilege (ring 3).<p>The main advantage with a safe language only system is that everything can be trusted enough that they can run in ring 0 in the kernel, thus very fast.  There will be no more slow user mode to kernel mode system calls, no more ring 3 to ring 0 transition.  It also allows all programs to run in one process address space, no more expensive process context switch (though thread context switch is still there).  Inter-program messages will be very fast since they are in the same address space.  Code quality will be improved with whole classes of bugs removed in safe languages.<p>Remember the complaint about microkernel?  That most of its OS services are in user mode servers and thus incurring extra kernel-to-user mode transition?  Imagine a system that has no kernel or user mode distinction and no mode transition.<p>The disadvantage of safe language system is that everything has to be in safe language, user program, kernel services, device drivers, etc, which is kind of impractical.  Singularity allows ""trusted"" drivers written in unsafe languages.  I don't know how well that works.<p>IMO a hybrid approach is more feasible.  An OS with the traditional kernel (preferably microkernel) that supports unsafe language programs and drivers, and a safe-language kernel that allows verified safe-language programs and drivers to run in ring 0.  This would maintain backward compatibility and allow radical new development that improve on quality and safety.",1281260936

And when I say unprecedented, I mean it in the literal, absolute sense.<p>The fact that many of them are working in unpleasant factories completely overshadows the fact that their parents were subsidence farmers and that their kids will have access to decent/good education and healthcare.<p>China isn't perfect, but the velocity of the development is central.

1585118,comment,1584988,1585043,0,0,barrkel,,,"It depends on who's doing the storing.<p>A4 page, which has 210x297mm, say a border of 10mm all around non-printable area, gives 190x277.<p>Say we print at a resolution of 0.5mm, and in 16 shades, so we get 4x4 = 16 bits per mm, or 2 bytes. That gives 105,260 bytes per page. Probably we can squeeze more bytes in than this, but let's allocate those to redundancy and error correcting codes.<p>So for 5TB (in hard drive size, 5e12) would take about 23.75 million sheets of paper printed on both sides. At 5g per sheet, that's about 119 metric tons.<p>1 ream (500 pages) of the 75g/m^2 A4 paper I have beside my printer here is about 50mm thick. Say 215x305x55mm including some slack for packaging, is a little over 3.6 litres in volume; total volume for 23.75 million sheets is 171,285 litres, or 171.285 cubic metres.<p>A room with a ceiling height of 3 metres would need to be only 8 meters on each side to store this. Of course, the room shouldn't have any windows and should be at the appropriate humidity, etc.<p>The cost of the paper, assuming $5 per 500 pages, is less than a quarter of a million. Much more forbidding is the labour and temporary acquisition of printers required to transcribe the data to paper. A good printer @50ppm would take nearly 2 years, assuming zero downtime and very quick paper and toner changes. To do it in more reasonable time and with more reliability, you'd want a bunch more printers; and of course, you'd need to hire the people to do the work of shuffling paper and carting it around, but I'd bet you could probably do it for less than the cost of the paper, particularly if you did it in a cheap labour country.",1281259736

Given enough space I'd also stick a couple of machines capable of reading the data just in case.<p>Removing that constraint and completely ignoring cost I'd also setup a low-risk savings account with $1M in it and put the data on S3 and Rackspace Cloud.  I'd store access credentials in the capsule.  Odds are pretty good one of those 2 will be around in 50 years (and you'll have a chunk of money left over in interest).<p>Try to keep everything ASCII, with really good text descriptions of data formats.<p>Realistically 50 years is not a long time: I would bet we'll still have legacy access to USB, SATA, and probably ext3 & NTFS (though probably not IDE).  Tons of computer folk who used these technologies will still be alive to work them.  English will still be the primary language in the US.<p>An interesting problem is what to do when the timescale allows these things to change.  What if nobody remembers USB, or what spinning platters are.  Or the English language?",1281259705

1585114,comment,1584260,1584260,0,0,AlexMuir,,,"I think one of the biggest reasons for Twitter's success has been the users it attracts (in chronological order):<p>1. Geeks - were not put off by 140char limit, abstract usernames, @-syntax, and appreciated the openness of the API.  Blogs like Techcrunch loved it because it is an extra distribution channel for their content = Huge media coverage in the tech media.<p>2. Celebrities/Media - It's ideally suited for this - in fact it could have been launched as a stand-alone product for celebs to communicate with their audience.  Because celebrities were using it = heavy coverage in the mainstream media.<p>3. Social media types - because of the media coverage, and the usage of the above two groups, social media people began trumpeting that Twitter was/is something special = business taking an interest.<p>4. The rest of the world - I don't think we're at this stage, and I don't think we will be.  It seems to me that most people use twitter to push their content - they aren't really engaged in a conversation, and following someone really means nothing.

There are social and environmental factors that are causing profound differences in disease rates; there's no reason to suspect that mental diseases are any different.<p>For my money, I would say that increase rates (real rates, not diagnosed rates) of mental disorders have gone up considerably due to, in no particular order:<p>* dietary changes<p>* environmental toxins<p>* less time spent outdoors (in bright sunlight)<p>* more sedentary lifestyles<p>* more low-level, long-term stress<p>* broader, shallower social circles (more severely exceeding Dunbar's number)<p>* changes in social norms (less physical contact, more space and time spent alone)<p>Some of the above probably have no effect, and there are probably important factors I didn't mention.

I mean, stealing a candy bar is wrong, and it has a real, measurable impact; stealing a car is also wrong, and has a real, measurable impact. but most people (and the law, at least in my jurisdiction) would make a distinction between the two crimes;  one results in a 'slap on the wrist'  while the other usually involves jail time and a felony record that makes it quite difficult for the perpetrator to get a legitimate job.<p>For that matter, there's another difference.  In both sports and finance, most of the money is in the surrounding ecosystem, not in the traders or athletes themselves.   The difference here is that if one athlete wins instead of another because of doping, this doesn't really effect the ecosystem all that much.  Okay, so reebok gets the extra shoe sales rather than nike, but you are going to probably move about the same number of units at about the same price with about the same labour input.  One athlete winning over another has nothing to do with the actual efficacy of the reebok or nike design or manufacturing operations.  The wronged party is mostly the athlete that doesn't dope.<p>But the stock market is different.  The stock market is how nearly all the corporations we work for and buy stuff from are owned.   Stock prices directly effect things like how much labour is put towards food production vs. car production.  There are real consequences to miss-allocated capital that are much larger than what brand of overpriced shoes is popular this week.

So if you blow an interview, it doesn't necessarily mean that you're stupid, it could just be that you drew a bad question or a bad interviewer or just weren't what the company was looking for.<p>I've been struggling with this for a while in the context of dating, which is another area where you'll face <i>lots</i> of rejection that usually isn't your fault.  I think that's a lot healthier than to phrase it as ""blame others"" - you should respect others, but realize that what they want is not necessarily what you want.  Heck, put that in a dating context and you can immediately see the problem: somebody who blames the girl when they're rejected is a creep, not a success.",1347442338

4509817,comment,4508873,4509390,7,0,nkurz,,,"<i>Does it really work?</i><p>Statistically, CBT combined with medication is currently the most effective clinical treatment for depression.  Personally, having tried a number of sessions, I think it works very well for some, and not so well for others.  If your tendency is to blame yourself for things that are beyond your control, it may be a great aid.  If instead you want to understand the world so as to make it better, CBT probably isn't a good choice.<p><i>I'm seeing people throw blame all the time, precisely because it's easier to cope with failure.</i><p>See, you've already got it.  Stop there.<p><i>But it's not healthy to pass the blame,</i><p>Why?  The studies seem to show that for most any measure of 'health', it is better not to blame yourself for the mistakes you make. You'll be happier, and live longer.  You (and I) might wish that taking personal responsibility would always be the better choice, but statistically it's often not.<p>My conclusion was that CBT is effective to the extent that you are willing to give up on the concept of truth.  People who train themselves to see only the positive are happier than those that insist on truth.  I decided that truth was more important to me than happiness, dropped the CBT, and stuck with the meds.",1347441070

4509814,comment,4508873,4509390,2,0,kahawe,,,"The example was very simple but basically it was correct. The difference is, in CBT it is a lot deeper, there is more going on. You will work on discovering where certain thought patterns come from, what triggers them and that alone can be very helpful. And then you will work on changing these patterns.<p>It is not so much someone ""slim"" berating a fat person; therapists actually don't tell you what to do or think and they never judge you. In CBT they interact with you a little more than in psychoanalysis but you never get told ""that's just because you are lazy!""... but you would discover e.g. you are (ab)using food as an escape mechanism to counter fear, anxiety or depression. By knowing that, you already have your finger on a harmful behavior you might not have understood before and then you can do something against it. But it all comes 80-90% from you, the patient. The therapist helps you understand what's going on, they can frame or re-frame situations for you, give you a different insight or share stories of other patients in similar situations. Often, the real problems are things, thought patterns which have been with you your whole life and typically were established when you were a child; you aren't even aware of them, they have always felt and come natural to you. You just end up feeling bad, afraid or depressed but all the behavior and patterns ultimately leading to that feel normal and ""right"", natural.<p>And at the very least, the fact you are talking about your problems and there is someone who actively listens can be beneficial.<p>Also, no, this is NOT something ""a friend would just do for you"", no matter how much it might seem like that at first. I made the mistake to listen, to show empathy to a severely depressed and suicidal friend and it caused a chain-reaction in my own mind to the point where I now firmly and consciously tell myself that I will never ever do that again for anyone. Not because empathy for friends was wrong in any way but because in a very selfish, very self-preserving way I do not want to bleed energy and thoughts into a black hole and when people who are so close to the edge ever open up then that's what they are... they cannot help it. But you best let an expert deal with it, it will be much better for you and the person suffering. I know this sounds terrible and cold but I think it is for the best for everyone involved. Be there for the one suffering but don't attempt to be an armchair-therapist to them, don't become their dump for all their negative emotions and problems. It WILL overwhelm you and will show you a side of life and the human mind that you cannot un-see.",1347441033

Browser vendors need to provide just basic access to bare metal and let OSS do the rest.<p>One way to help is to ask for lower level OS apis to be exposed by browsers, so that the open source community can do the rest:<p>1. Ask for UDP to be exposed to trusted web apps installed by the user. This will let the P2P community race ahead without having to wait for WebRTC to get released and then fixed.<p>2. Ask for TCP to be exposed to trusted web apps installed by the user. This will instantly enable things like SMTP clients running in the browser without the need for WebSocket proxies/proprietary gateway servers.<p>3. Ask for POSIX to be exposed to trusted web apps installed by the user. This will lead to an explosion of database innovation in the browser. IndexedDB is design-by-committee. Insist on proper POSIX not the FileSystem API. Borrow from the Node API. Impedance mismatch is crippling browser storage.<p>4. Low-hanging fruit: ask for LevelDB to be exposed directly (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=128865"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=128865</a>).

You see such shortcomings in the standard library as well, for instance for the ParseFloat string conversion functions in strconv, you have to specify the number of bits of the data type. It would be much better if the return type was some generic type for fractional numbers. Now, if you want to have a single precision double, you have to specify that you want to have a 32-bit float and then cast it to a float32.<p>That said, I believe that Go needs generics, but I'd rather see them implement them properly than to rush.",1347440903

I can tell you anecdotally that it really does work, and it is among the most scientifically verified treatments out there.<p>I'm not sure if I understand your objections to CBT -- there's a lot of them -- so let me restate them. If I've misunderstood please correct me. You seem to be saying:<p>1) One can control one's highest-level, ""executive"" thoughts, but not feelings. CBT is assuming far too much control over emotions, and it's like blaming a depressed person for not ""snapping out of it"".<p>2) It is also bad to throw off blame onto other people when you should be learning lessons about your own failures.<p>Okay, first of all, I think you are quite mistaken about how much your emotions <i>are</i> related to the content of your thoughts. There are indeed people who have chemical imbalances in their mind, but for most people, their thoughts are the primary trigger of their emotions.<p>The basic assumption of CBT is not that you should blame others more, or yourself more. The assumption is that your thinking is clouded somehow and needs to be set straight. This is usually done by rigorously stepping through every part of the thought process to reveal the errors. One should accept the blame that is due oneself, but not go any further.<p>I never followed a program of cognitive-behavioral therapy all the way, but I have done it sometimes. I do remember a moment of revelation that occurred when I was out for a walk. CBT encourages you to slow down and listen to yourself very carefully. I noticed, for the first time, a voice in my head that was constantly leaping to very bad conclusions based on poor evidence (e.g. very minor setbacks, like an untied shoe, are connected into a pattern of lifelong failure). The thoughts were so automatic I had stopped realizing that they were thoughts at all; I only felt the wave of bad feelings that resulted from them.<p>My personal feeling is that a lot of people have this sort of problem, rather than any chemical imbalance. Antidepressants may be primarily useful in lifting the fog enough for one to have the mental energy to start CBT. Some studies show that using both is better than either alone.",1347440724

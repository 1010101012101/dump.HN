336296,comment,336153,336260,0,0,nostrademons,,,"> Proof - if it didn't make majority happy it would be scrapped.<p>That's not a proof at all.  Representative democracy doesn't mean the majority gets its way on every issue - otherwise, it's a fairly good bet that CEO pay would be capped, the Wall Street bailout would never have happened, and we wouldn't still be in Iraq.  Rather, it means that when the government screws up on <i>enough</i> issues and pisses <i>enough</i> people off, we get to throw them out of office.<p>Granted, my experience isn't a proof either, for the reasons you point out.  (Although - talking to random strangers in line for the checkpoint is about as close to a relevant random sample as you can get.)  But then, I didn't claim it was.",1224308588

It keeps us sheeple under the illusion of safety, we keep buying plane tickets and a whole economy springs up surrounding the airport (not to mention the firms supplying the TSA with equipment).  That's good for a ton of voter approval.  Even better, if you don't vote for the TSA your opponent can call you out: 'Senator so-and-so wants our innocent children to die in a fire at the hands of scary men with beards!'<p>Yes.  I'm jaded.

What’s our runway?
   2. What experiments are we running to extend our runway? (e.g. chasing revenue, raising capital, taking debt, writing

I ended up spending a week without and loved the experience so much I delayed buying a new one for a another month.  Once I got the new one, I was receiving less calls as others had gotten  used to not reaching me.  Its been great.<p>I hope to make it a lifetime habit soon enough...hopefully I won't have to acquire as many karma points as Stallman or Knuth to reach this level. ;)",1224306524

Make all but the first group in each route non-capturing, and then replace it with something like &quot; $1 $2 $3 .... $n&quot;, and count the spaces. You&#x27;d have to then do another regex just for that route with all groups capturing.

I say no, the value of messenger bytes is nearly zero unless you can hold the users hostage and extract large sums from them (as AT&T and Verizon did on SMS). All user actions are not created equal in terms of the economic value they generate - one network of actions is not inherently as valuable as another; this premise will eventually burst the myth of Snapchat and WhatsApp being worth their current valuations.<p>How much are all those users worth? Not much if they don&#x27;t actually generate cash, which is why webmail and traditional instant messaging is worthless financially.<p>WhatsApp was a threat to them, and that demonstrates just how financially dark Facebook&#x27;s future is. Facebook will have to perpetually destroy its shareholder value buying up non-performing businesses to try to stall those upstarts from destroying Facebook&#x27;s temporary ad platform. Facebook is likely to get Craigslist&#x27;d (replaced by an endless parade of dirt cheap social apps with no business prospects), because the real financial value of what it does is low.<p>The app itself is very useful to its users, but it&#x27;s not financially worth much, no different than Gmail or Yahoo Mail (which both have hundreds of millions of users that send bazillions of messages per day).<p>Take away: the messages aren&#x27;t worth much financially; the users aren&#x27;t worth much financially. Five years from now, people are going to look back on all of this, and think it was crazy how much was being paid for &quot;users&quot; and &quot;messages.&quot;",1392900940

7270441,comment,7266546,7268872,8,0,nzp,,,"> We know a ton about the brain but so little about the mind itself. We still don&#x27;t have definitive answers to what consciousness is, why it&#x27;s here, what&#x27;s useful for, etc. Some people debate whether the mind exists at all. Also, there&#x27;s still very little understanding of the difference between the conscious and unconscious mind.<p>One of the really, really bad consequences of the Cold War was the scientific divide between East and West.  By that I mean serious lack of scientific data exchange between the blocks.  The consequences are still felt and this area (the problem of consciousness) is the one that suffered.  The problem of &quot;consciousness&quot; was basically solved, at least at a conceptual level, by Soviet psychology and neuropsychology.  Here I refer, of course, to the work of Vygotsky and Luria.  What is consciousness?  Almost nothing at all by itself.  Consciousness as found in humans is a consequence of our cognitive development and the advanced symbolic capabilities of humans.  The subjective perception we have of the thing we call consciousness is &quot;simply&quot; (it&#x27;s not really simple when you get into details) a product of humans acquiring language skills (I&#x27;m simplifying).<p>This is not to say the subject is trivial, it takes volumes to describe what is happening, but the thing we informally call &quot;consciousness&quot; is really nothing at all in and of itself, and the perception we have of it is just a result of the very complicated process of cognitive development.  Thin air, like Lisp&#x27;s cons.<p>If you want to read on it I can recommend Vygotsky&#x27;s <i>Language and Thought</i> (actually, it&#x27;s his only book) and Luria&#x27;s <i>Language and Consciousness</i> (I&#x27;m not sure it was ever translated into English, it&#x27;s a collection of his lecture notes from a university course he did on the subject) or possibly <i>The Cognitive Development: Its Cultural and Social Foundations</i>.<p>Why this line of thinking is mostly ignored in the West I have no idea.  Why do we still cling to metaphysical (even religious I would say) phantasies about &quot;consciousness&quot; is an interesting topic itself.  Is it because it&#x27;s romantic to think there&#x27;s something special, transcendent, about our minds?  Are we really that sentimental?

It's not criticizing Yang specifically in the slightest, nor does it make any predictions about the future, a Yahoo ""collapse"", or what would happen if its founders took over.<p>This submission has a misleading, attention-stealing headline.",1214794739

231658,comment,231153,231605,0,0,smanek,,,"My point is that these various religious books are full of misogyny, intolerance, and violence (which you have agreed with).<p>At that point any reasonable person would say something along the lines of: ""You know what, this book isn't very good. It may have been decent x years ago, and it does have some good ideas, but on balance it isn't that good. Let's keep the good stuff, throw out the bad, and come up with a new canon based on the best thinking of today.""<p>But that isn't what happened. Islam and Judaism have chosen to keep their deeply flawed books at the center of their religions (and yes, they are the center). And we still have wackos using the text in these books to justify their violence and bigotry.<p>So, until Jews and Muslims openly disavow huge potions of the torah and quaran, I have very little respect for them.",1214794646
231657,comment,231621,231621,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Marijuana is a plant containing many chemicals, and this article refers to one of them. So, the word ""Marijuana"" shouldn't be in the headline. When chemicals are actually useful, they tend to be legal, as with Marinol (thc) and cocaine (as an anaesthetic) and obviously morphine. There will never be ""medical marijuana""...no more than ""medical poppies"" anyway.",1214794510

231649,comment,231558,231646,0,0,ajross,,,"I think more charitably it's because mono is in some senses a write-only project.  It's a collection of people who are essentially writing software to an external spec.  Except for design details at the very core (probably handled via private mail between the half dozen people involved), there really isn't any need for elaborate collaboration on development details.  And futures issues (the ""how do I do this?"" kind of discussion) are all directed at microsoft anyway, not mono.<p>I guess I'd have expected it to be a little sterile.

231645,comment,231515,231515,0,0,rory096,,,"This article's outlook is way too simplistic; Chinese won't be the only influence on English's future. China still accounts for only a somewhat small fraction of English speakers, so other languages and cultures will have as much, if not more, impact. Also, this time won't be like Latin- there won't be any collapse of global society, so eventually the various dialects will homogenize, both because everyone has to understand them (otherwise what's the point of a lingua franca?) and because people from all over will be interacting so much. The end result probably won't be exactly like modern English, but I don't expect it to be too far removed, as all the changes should more or less balance themselves out.",1214793114

231643,comment,231381,231462,0,0,vchakrav,,,"Actually, Google does have one major challenge -- how to motivate its people. I'm not talking about fresh college graduates, but rather people who are high up in the organization because they happened to join early on. Many of these people are worth a lot of money, and presumably see day to day work at Google as a way to spend their time, socialize, and to flex their political muscle.<p>In such a place, bringing in new hungry blood is very difficult to do, especially since the old crowd will try very hard to protect their power structure. In the long term, this does cause problems in the ranks, since success within the company starts to become a measure of how well you can navigate politically, vs. the quality of work produced.",1214792937

231637,comment,231589,231589,0,0,raju,,,"Good advice from both mechanical_fish and pivo. The GNU Emacs book is a tad old, considering that emacs is now v.22 but it certainly will help you get from nowhere to a slow jog ;-). Considering I too am trying to learn Emacs, here's one thing that I try and do. Learn one new command everyday, and practice that all day. I mean literally - for e.g. Ctrl-T swaps two characters (I learned that one today). I essentially just started typing random letters into emacs and hitting ctrl-t every now and then (amongst some other commands I learned over the last few days).<p>A good editor has to be an extension of your fingers. Emacs can do that for you, once you accept that the learning curve is extremely steep. Another thing I learned, don't try and bite off more than you can chew. Emacs has several modes and hundreds of extensions that you can install, each with their own commands, and key-board shortcuts (not to mention the initial set up and configuration). Take it one step at a time, figure out the basic commands from the tutorial, and take it from there. Once you have established mastery of moving around within emacs, basic editing, searching etc you will not only be ready, but be much more comfortable with the ""zen of emacs"".<p>Here is another discussion (of several more, I am sure) that I came across on HN today. Some good advice there...<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=230639"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=230639</a><p>Good luck.",1214792582

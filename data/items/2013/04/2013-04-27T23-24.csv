The way I picture it is that if you closed your eyes and held a ball, you would picture a sphere... but it is because you have in internalized image of a sphere.  If you had never seen a sphere, you probably wouldn't be able to imagine one... even if you could feel all it's dimensions.

The article doesn't actually compare the variability among these faces to the variability among a control population of Korean faces, so I don't know to interpret the results anyway, but my guess just by looking at the eigenfaces is that they are capturing pose variation in addition to variation in facial structure.<p>Check out the results page on the Labeled Faces in the Wild site for some better algorithms that are more robust to changes in pose, along with their performance on a sample data set: <a href=""http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/results.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/results.html</a>.

(anything that gives a higher percentage chance to reproduce would tend to beneficially differentially propagate a male-promiscuous geneticly driven behavior, in a way that it would not be selected for among females, since they are generally limited in procreation capacity per unit time in a way that males are not. Elements of this are seen in the animal kingdom, but I don't know whether it's generally accepted ""fact"" or not. If it is, and it's programmed as part of mammalian maleness, it's reasonable to assume that humans would also exhibit it naturally, and not just via locker room social pressure or other ""buried"" influences which might also be present.)",1367106991

Plus I have anecdotal data from several indie musician friends that when they release digitally, online physical sales effectively cease.  I do know there <i>exists</i> the kind of super-supportive fan who will buy digitally and then also buy the physical cd as an expression of support, such as several of my best friends and family members, but in a magnitude sense, I think they're a negligible percentage.  At any rate, I'm having trouble thinking of how my staged process will risk me missing out on any benefits of digital-leading-to-physical.  I'll still release digitally; I'll just do it later.<p>As for piracy, it's a good question.  Keep in mind I'm pretty small-potatoes.  The question is, for a largely anonymous indie-artist, is the piracy risk of releasing physically-only greater than or less than the piracy risk of releasing digitally?  My hypothesis is that it's less.  But I'd have to find a way to measure availability and popularity of my tracks on pirate sites.  If there's a way to measure a spike of demand, <i>and</i> ascertain that it's from people that <i>would</i> buy the digital tracks if they were available, then yeah, it would make sense to speed up the time frame of the digital release.

Pandora and Spotify are not selling goods; they are selling access""<p>except that's always what the record industry has been selling.  at least Pandora and Spotify are honest about what they are.  If i bought your vinyl record, do i actually own that or is really just a proxy for personal usage license?  Can I play that record at my wedding, or in my office, or at a party with more than some arbitrary number of people?<p>Intellectual property is not a physical good.  The recording industry has coasted along for the last 50 years or so on this strange phenomenon that allowed their IP to be sold as though it were a physical product while at the same time getting IP protections <i>in addition to</i> the revenue of a physical good, and they've made a ton of money doing so - more money than they ever should have.  Now the gravy train is ending.<p>Getting paid per-play rather means that artists are finally seeing how people actually value their music.  You can't use law to make your music more valuable.  If you want to earn more then make more music, or go on tour, or put some effort into selling your music for soundtracks and the like.  The rates spotify pays represent the actual value to the consumer - they aren't making a profit, and if spotify were any more than what it currently costs, i wouldn't pay for it.

I printed 300 copies as that was the smallest I could go without it becoming a CD-R instead of a redbook.  They'll arrive in a couple of weeks, and I'm thinking of selling them for $10 apiece.  I spent a few years writing the songs and figuring out how to record and produce them as professionally as I'm able.  I spent countless hours on the project and somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 on production costs.  Despite that, I know the drill - I don't really have expectations of making a lot of money on this, or even meeting my costs.  But I do intend to try as hard as I can to maximize my revenue.<p>It's amazing what kind of culture has sprung up in the selling/delivery sphere.  All these companies spring up to ""empower"" the indie musician and they invest in all sorts of signaling to make sure we know we had better sign up for their services or else we're not taking our career seriously.  Examples:<p>CDBaby: keeps $4 of every cd sale, even though you've already spent $1-$3 per every cd you manufacture.  As opposed to just setting up a paypal link or merchant account on your website, and shipping it yourself.  2.9% + $0.30 sounds a lot better than $4.  (Shipping costs are additional either way and passed on to the user.)  I have trouble imagining at what point I'd want to spend $3.41 <i>per cd</i> to save myself the effort of just sticking a mailing label to a padded envelope and dropping it in my mailbox.<p>Bandcamp: keeps 10% (by way of keeping every 10th chunk of revenue for itself).  It's based around the belief that people will pay more if it's freely available, or will tend to pay more than the ""suggested"" price.  I haven't really dived into their studies but I just cannot believe there isn't a flaw in them.  A lot of it seems based off of the logic that if it worked for Radiohead or NIN (with their already built-in audiences) then it should also work for small indie musicians.  (And Radiohead and NIN have also since stepped away from the free/pay-what-you-want model.)  At any rate, 2.9% + $0.30 sounds better than 10%, since I have to do fulfillment on my end either way.<p>iTunes/digital media: $0.99 no matter what.  $6.93 for a seven-song album, and you can't set your own price.  If you have a major label you can apparently set your album price higher but smaller indies don't seem to have access to that privilege.  Plus, if your digital album costs $6.93, then you've basically destroyed your options of selling your hard-copy.<p>And everyone knows the common complaints about spotify and pandora.<p>At any rate, I'm considering going through a lengthy staged release process, in an effort to measure all sorts of conversion and gather data along the way.<p>1) Release physical cd only, with no music previews.  At this point, the few hundred people on my mailing list are already interested in the cd anyway, so we'll see how far that goes, along with recommendations to friends.  Maintain a list of addresses for people who indicate they won't buy until it's released digitally.<p>2) Marketing music previews of each song and on an album level, through promoted Facebook posts (friends-of-friends) and advertising.  The general principle here is to still not ever release the entire full-length tracks, and funnel people to buying the physical cd.<p>3) Release digitally to services that are not on-demand and can't be downloaded.  This means Jango and Pandora.  Jango also allows me to buy paid plays and get a bunch of demographic data points to see which tracks are popular with which groups.  I can then use that to do more targeted ads over at facebook or maybe through google.<p>4) When things are really dying down physically, finally release through iTunes and bandcamp (allow full previews) and other sites where you can actually buy the tracks digitally, and see what happens with ""discovery""<p>5) When I'm finally ready to just trash the whole project, release it on Spotify and forget about it to start working on the next cd.",1367105241

When it comes to getting _creative_ with the UI component as a developer, though, I've found it tough to do _really_ well. It gets gimmick-y quickly. Path's QuadCurveMenu has been the best implementation of any type of circular menu that I've seen. Summly had a radial menu as well, but I didn't find it particularly useful - just fun to play with.<p>For anyone interested, here are some examples using the radmenu plugin: <a href=""http://tikku.com/jquery-radmenu-plugin#radmenu_tutorial_4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tikku.com/jquery-radmenu-plugin#radmenu_tutorial_4</a>.

And I'm certainly not advocating committing such code.  (Or, let me be more clear, I'm not advocating publishing such code.  I think it's fine to commit it to a local branch, but the code should be clean by the time it's merged to a public branch.)<p>But, if you've prematurely declared a variable and find it's throwing a warning, I see no issue with temporarily commenting out the declaration.  The only downside I can think of is someone accidentally commits a single-line, commented out variable declaration.<p>I can say I rarely run into this specific problem.  I tend to use variables once they're declared.  It's possible my development style is just different.  If I found this to be a big problem, I probably would disable the warning for debug builds.",1367103931

We took investment because to grow your company beyond the first few people you need to pay people money.  Sometimes certain ideas or opportunities you might want to invest in cost money.  And that is what the VCs provide you, money.  Sure, we could bootstrap and generate the money ourselves, but a) it requires short-term trade offs and b) its much slower.  And slower is a problem because time is a really limited resource.  Opportunity cost for all your employees, time for competitors to spring up and try to beat you, etc.<p>VCs are a tool.  They allow people like me to have upside while at the same time make a salary.  They allow me to instill confidence in potential candidates that our business is safe and if they take the job here, the company will still exist in 5 years.  Look, Techcrunch is not an accurate picture of the valley, I'm not going to dispute that with you.  But VCs are not evil people or a scam.  They are a tool that for the right startup, at the right timing, can be hugely beneficial.  It is pretty stupid that the best way to get written about is to raise funding, but then again getting written about is so inconsequential to success you can just ignore it.  However having resources to grow and accelerate can be very consequential to success, and you need to make sure not to confuse the two.",1367103852

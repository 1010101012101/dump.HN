9981764,comment,9981440,9981639,0,0,agentultra,,,"Python, fwiw, is a <i>better</i> BASIC. It includes a built-in Turtle graphics system and a decent IDE. You can teach loops and draw graphics in just a few lines of code:<p><pre><code>    import turtle
    
    turtle.setup()
    turtle.forward(100)
    turtle.turn(90)
    turtle.forward(100)
</code></pre>
And so on. That initial experience has been one of the easiest to teach kids outside of a visual environment like Scratch. Some friends of mine have tried teaching Javascript but it&#x27;s just frustrating: you have to teach looping with intermediate values and mutation, you have to teach the DOM, and if you want to get turtle graphics... well you have to scour the net for a poor implementation that barely works and teach the <script> tag... you get the idea. It&#x27;s painful.<p>The ubiquitousness is a huge advantage. Installing Python on a Windows machine and running programs is not as easy as &quot;just being there.&quot; And being able to share your programs with a URL has so much potential... potential I feel is wasted by the walled-garden nature of code and presentation in modern browsers, crappy developer tools, and a lack of usable built-in batteries.<p>Python will never be as ubiquitous as Javascript. But it&#x27;s pretty close: OS X includes a Python distribution as do most Linux distributions. Windows is the place where it hurts. I don&#x27;t know if it could be, &quot;the new BASIC,&quot; but it could certainly be a better one.<p>(This coming from someone who has fond memories of BASIC on the Apple IIc and Amiga 500).",1438351070

Very few people can, or want to live like RMS and never compromise on their beliefs. Most of us have responsibilities or hobbies that require us to manage our time. The negativity is a reflection that Linux works great until it doesn&#x27;t. An update disables your network card, your GPU doesn&#x27;t fully run under linux, an update to GCC removes your ability to update a port. At some point, people get tired of having to fix things and just want the OS to work out of the box. That being said, there are plenty of free software projects that do work well on Windows, such as Emacs and Firefox.<p>>Although many of you use GNU/Linux daily, it seems that most have failed to truly understand the value, the very significant importance, that the GNU project and the FSF represent in our world.<p>It&#x27;s Linux, not GNU/Linux; only RMS calls it that because he&#x27;s a poor marketer. Speaking of which, the FSF does not realize the value it brings to people. It&#x27;s not free software. The trend for most people is they simply do not care, because the FSF is terrible at marketing. If people do not respond to your campaign, it&#x27;s not valuable. The value of the FSF is not in freedom, it&#x27;s in protecting people&#x27;s choice.

Get your friends to help you, professors, post it here and get hacker news to help (brave!), or even hire a professional service to do it. Find a nice template online and use that. I&#x27;ve seen an astonishing number of astonishingly bad resumes. If you are having trouble even getting a phone screen, it says something about your applications (if you&#x27;re having trouble in phone screens or during on-sites it says something else).<p>Some common problems I&#x27;ve seen with resumes:<p><pre><code>  - Grammar, spelling and formatting problems.

  - Breadth but not depth - people list a million technologies but don&#x27;t mention a single thing they did with those technologies.

  - Overly long - some people have a six month stint somewhere and yet write two pages of what they did there, filled with technical buzzwords.

  - Too short - people worked somewhere for three years and yet only write a single bullet point.

  - Unexplained gaps, especially early on. Not necessarily fair, but this can be a red flag for people.
</code></pre>
The other trap that I&#x27;ve seen people fall into (less fairly) are technological traps:<p><pre><code>  - Someone out of school that only knows one big name language like Java. People interpret this as someone who didn&#x27;t do much outside of class.

  - Windows-centric developers in Silicon Valley. There&#x27;s a lot of bias in SV against Windows developers, and someone with a list of Microsoft centric technologies risks coming off as someone who wants to be a Windows systems engineer in shops that mostly run off of Linux and Mac OS.
</code></pre>
Finally, in the definitely not fair front is names. My Chinese and Indian friends have reported that by putting a Western first name on the resume their response rates more than doubled.",1438349825

There would be some corner cases, but mostly it would just work for the existing code whereas, from the perspective of the 2.x users, now it just doesn&#x27;t. I know, I write compilers for living. The maintenance cost from the point of view of the compiler maintainer would almost invisibly increase (there are much less trivial things to worry about) the benefit for the current users would be significant. The reason it wasn&#x27;t done is much more &quot;political&quot; (&quot;just one way to do it&quot;) than technical.<p>Specifically: once it&#x27;s declared that <i>print</i> is a function, you don&#x27;t need to treat the string print as keyword. Then you can notice comparing <i>print expression</i> and <i>print( expression )</i> that <i>if you know</i> that <i>print</i> is a function the braces aren&#x27;t giving you any new information. So the difference is do you want to encode the knowledge &quot;print is a function&quot; in the compiler or not. That encoding is trivial, and even if it can be called &quot;a special case&quot; isn&#x27;t anything that anybody would spend any significant energy maintaining. It obviously appears to be &quot;less elegant&quot; to describe your compiler having &quot;a special knowledge that print is a function&quot; but there are even ways out of that: you can generalize such constructs (function calls without using the return value). But then &quot;there would be more than one way to do it.&quot;<p>But orders of magnitude more 2.x Python programs would &quot;just work&quot; when started under a such 3.x. Of course, once you accept that the transition should be less painful, you&#x27;d need provide the way for libraries to also have the &quot;newer&quot; and the &quot;older&quot; ways to do it. &quot;More than one way&quot; is potentially contagious. But, sometimes &quot;worse is better.&quot;",1438349594

I ran through the languages I know well in my head: Java, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Javascript, Go, Swift... Wasn&#x27;t sure what to tell him. His expectations are fairly high, due to Minecraft and video games and whatever.<p>So, on one level I agree with the author: Python (or Ruby) is probably the closest to the original feel of BASIC. You can dive into simple statements without wrapping it in a class. You don&#x27;t need to worry about functional vs. OOP or methods or functions. You can just write some code.<p>But, as I thought about it, I realized my son already _is_ programming. He&#x27;s just using Minecraft&#x27;s red stones.

There are a few tools out there that do it, but the gap between the visual building experience and the programming experience is way to wide.

And while the capabilities of Python are vastly greater than BASIC of yore, I think a beginner&#x27;s expectations of what they should be able to do have grown even more quickly.<p>These days, typically someone who wants to learn to program wants to do one of two things: (1) make a website or (2) create an app. For a lot of types of sites Python is still a great choice (Flask is definitely one of the easiest frameworks out there to pick up, and I&#x27;m actually teaching my wife to program by making a basic Flask app with her). However, for other interests Javascript or even Java or Swift may be more appropriate first languages.<p>I guess that what I&#x27;m trying to say is that the best first language is the one that ignites your imagination with its possibilities, rather than the one that&#x27;s the absolute easiest to learn.",1438349540

Learn this and understand how it applies to your systems, your processes, and especially (surprise) your people.<p>This is one quarter of how W. Edwards Deming promoted organizational quality control—understanding how variation works, period. (The other three being understanding psychology, understanding systems, and understanding the theory of knowledge or scientific method).<p>This applies directly to understanding whether observed variation has a common cause (is a natural pattern of the system), or is special cause (something unexpected): <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cause_and_special_cause_(statistics)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cause_and_special_cause...</a> and this impacts how you handle the variation.<p>For those criticizing validity, I&#x27;ll say this is a way to mentally model how to understand variation, and is not meant to be 100% accurate. You&#x27;re trading intuitive modeling for perfect math. But it will allow you to get close in a back-of-the-napkin quick way so you can identify patterns to study in more depth. Also, think of this in the context of many types of systems, not just a tight electrical signal pattern (which are easy systems to understand). Systems of people doing software development, machines in manufacturing processes, complex network error patterns, etc etc.<p>People don&#x27;t often have a good idea of what&#x27;s important and what&#x27;s noise, especially when you don&#x27;t even have a control chart but are just using intuition and a few data points. We see outliers and variations all the time in processes, especially in human processes like those we encounter in most software companies. Estimation and delays, developer performance, load failures; all kinds of complex systems that exhibit variation that people are usually &quot;winging it&quot; to understand.<p>Instead of understanding the variation and the data, people often handle every large variation in the same way, trying to &quot;fix&quot; it or peg it on some obvious correlation they think they observe. This says: hold on, understand what you&#x27;re looking at intuitively first. Then gather more data. Don&#x27;t act without understanding. Deming was fond of saying, &quot;don&#x27;t just do something, stand there!&quot; Lots to be learned from that, and much to be gained from the simple intuitive understanding of patterns in variation.",1438349318

But ads often constitute a theft of attention, a non-consensual transmission of ideas. TV advertisements, email spam, billboards, flashing banner ads…they’re all there to steal a little of your attention. The chances of successful replication are lower of course, but the advertiser only needs a few successes to make it worth their while. Not to stretch the analogy too far, but this non-consensual transmission of ideas could aptly be described as a sort of “memetic assault”.<p>Tl;tr Ideas replicate only through attention, thus the battle for our attention.",1438348758

If I truly hated their software, I wouldn&#x27;t be using it or talking about it at all. For all of Mozilla&#x27;s faults, the only real cross-platform alternative (Chrome) is even worse. That one forces silent updates, won&#x27;t let me download and run older versions, won&#x27;t let me disable WebRTC, was the inspiration for the new Mozilla UI I dislike, sends a lot of data back to Google, etc.<p>The problem with not complaining is that when everyone does it, the developers have no idea why 30% of their market share is gone, yet everyone who remained is still happy with the changes.<p>Further, I think really major software projects like Firefox and Gnome are in a different category. People&#x27;s livelihoods depend on these software programs. Totally changing things around can have serious effects on people, not just those who hate change.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to be a single developer working on a solitaire game and deciding to redesign everything; it&#x27;s quite another to be a multi-million dollar company with hundreds of employees and tens of millions of users and deciding to redesign everything.<p>When you care about your market share, have employees that depend upon your success, and so forth ... you really should make the effort to listen to your community of users.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget the whole reason we&#x27;re having this discussion is because Mozilla just berated Microsoft for removing user choice.

And from the perspective of a landlord, that&#x27;s what matters.  New companies are the least predictable in their needs, their revenue stream, and their long-term prospects.  They tend to have inexperienced managers and flighty owners.  All of these things are true regardless of how they are funded, what industry they operate in or whether the owners are trying to become huge overnight, bootstrap into a comfortable living, or whatever else.<p>Established companies grow and shrink, too.  They close offices and factories, open new ones, and occasionally file for bankruptcy protection.  But they do these things much less frequently than a new company, and they do it with the backing of a much larger and more reliable cash flow.  That cash flow means that even in bankruptcy, an established company&#x27;s creditors usually end up with a significant recovery.  From a landlord&#x27;s perspective, these are the things that make established companies more attractive than startups.

But modern understandings of cognitive biases show how advertising works on deeper levels, and even works despite us knowing about the tricks that are being used on us.<p>>The problem is that there&#x27;s a severe imbalance. Advertisers are getting better and better at attacking -- at figuring out precisely what makes us tick, down to the level of pixels on an A/B-tested website.

We ask them to give Attorney General Harald Range more occasions for intimidation campaigns against journalists.<p>Only extensive mandatory data retention will allow the attorney general to keep track of:<p>- Which journalists report on anti-constitutional practices of secret services?<p>- Who has expressed themselves against surveillance fetishists?<p>- Who prevents the under-cover operatives/informers of the secret service from constructing and supporting extreme right-wing structures?<p>- Who removed the water taps from major construction sites?<p>&quot;We have finally figured out how to dislodge mr. Range from his lethargy&quot; says Dirk Engling, CCC spokesman. &quot;For a long time we thought that the leaking of data about citizens and institutions did not bother the attorney general, but we realize now that we were mistaken.

We are looking forward to receive contributions in the following domains:<p>- Secret services and mass surveillance as well as their commercial partners<p>- Covert investigations and liaison officers,<p>- Reconstructions of shredded documents<p>- Aiding and abetting of right-wing terrorists<p>- Surveillance operations involving unpopular opposition parties.<p>A special prize will be awarded for any revelations that cause the attorney general to reactivate the since spring 2014 weakened prosecutions against foreign and domestic secret services as well as the German government.",1438348132

First of all, speech recognition by itself isn&#x27;t exactly trivial, and that&#x27;s become more and more obvious as we&#x27;ve seen the smallest accent mess with the digital assistants on all the major phones. Yes, technically, Dragon Naturally Speaking existed a decade ago and worked somewhat, but needed a LOT of training, and was dumb as a brick. It doesn&#x27;t compare.<p>But beyond that, understanding the meaning of the spoken word is difficult too. Yes, NLTs exist, and they can be very good, but you really need something that a team is administering. They can identify pain points and do regular updates to help... things like an odd band name that is ALWAYS misunderstood, some odd combination of words that confuses a question with a 911 call, etc., otherwise you&#x27;re just going to end up frustrated.<p>I should also mention that a digital assistant really needs the power of a full search engine behind it. This allows for auto-correction of mispronounced words, but it also allows near-instant lookups for relevant information. If this was running on your local machine, not only will the processing be slow for some things, it will also be more limited in it&#x27;s ability to fully process all possible meanings, and it will need to be updated CONSTANTLY.<p>These companies, by putting the language processing in the cloud, are throwing teams and hardware at the problem, and yet they STILL have embarrassing difficulties when it comes to actually understanding sometimes. Consider that for a moment... hundreds, even thousands of servers running the latest software for processing natural language for multi-millions of people aren&#x27;t capable of getting your meaning 100% of the time.<p>Incidentally, I realize that there some open source projects out there that do some rudimentary voice recognition and processing, however they suffer from the same issues addressed above and are MUCH more limited in many many ways. Many of them still make use of cloud-based services for processing the audio, btw. The one advantage, I will say, is that you have to ability to add your own custom commands and actions, which the major systems obviously don&#x27;t allow.",1438347835

168770,comment,168636,168636,0,0,vesterr,,,"""And the very best hackers tend to be idealistic. They're not desperate for a job. They can work wherever they want.""<p>I've heard PG repeat this but I think it's fallacious.  A lot of up-and-coming hackers can't pick and choose where to work except in the sense that any person can quit one job and apply for another one.  They can't unilaterally get themselves into Google, for example.<p>Established hackers also may have constraints, such as time and family commitments, that keep them working a stable job instead of a startup, or keep them where they are rather than uprooting to go work at e.g. Google for a lower standard of living (possibly less salary and almost certainly higher cost-of-living, if you work at the HQ) even if they'd prefer to work there.<p>Or your company may fold and you may have trouble finding an awesome job right away and have to settle for a tolerable one instead.  Considering that so many start-up founders live hand to mouth, they are <i>quite</i> likely to be ""desperate for a job"" at various points, or at <i>least</i> unable to work ""wherever they want"".<p>They might also find that the startup they <i>want</i> to do is just not as profitable or likely to succeed as some other one, and end up working on the other one instead.  Scratching your own itch does not necessarily coincide with ""making something people want"" on a commercial scale.",1208728479

Not to mention in SV you have a lot of other venues for networking.<p>I talked to a graduate of Stanford's program about his opinion on it. He told me the biggest value the program gives you are new contacts (He didn't really think the class content was anything special), but since he didn't want to go to Wall St/ or to Big Corporation X (where the cred helps at times) he felt that he should have just skipped it and instead just dived into a startup (using his MBA school money for the venture instead).<p>Good MBA programs typically cost from $30000-$50000 per year and it doesn't even include opportunity costs.",1208728217

An MBA experience will help you become more of a generalist, you will interact with people who are different from you and solve problems differently. It will also open up career options you may not have today, hedge funds, investment banks, consulting - some of which are intellectually interesting and pay well. Even if you decide to do a startup later, you will have friends working at VCs & operating companies that you can get help from.<p>If on the other hand you have decided that you want to live the rest of your life as a hacker, maybe it is not such a good idea.

The true purpose of a business is to provide goods & services to its customers.  The ""profit motive"" is essentially a check on the resources consumed by the business, to ensure that it's not spending resources inefficiently, much as PG mentions in the 2nd footnote.<p>Up until the 1970s, it was common for corporations to be managed ""to balance the interests of all stakeholders - employees, customers, shareholders, and the community.""  You can blame Milton Friedman for changing that: he popularized the notion of a corporation existing purely to maximize shareholder value, enshrining it so deeply in American culture that it's become law, and corporate directors can now be sued if they consider anything other than the interests of shareholders.

Success on the Internet is all about scale. Growing faster than your competitors is key because your product can iterate faster and achieve a dominant position. Giving it away for free and being benevolent helps spur growth and is thus a very important strategy.<p>But I'm not sure that this holds outside the Internet realm. In other industries, you cannot be too benevolent and non-profit-like. I can't think of many examples that have succeeded via this route. I'm not sure I agree with your idea that Microsoft started out as benevolent. I think the profit motive was there from day one. To back this up, look at this letter written in 1976 by BillG:<p>""As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software...The fact is, no one besides us has invested a lot of money in hobby software...Most directly, the thing you do is theft...I would appreciate letters from any one who wants to pay up.""<p>(<a href=""http://www.blinkenlights.com/classiccmp/gateswhine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blinkenlights.com/classiccmp/gateswhine.html</a>)<p>So acting like a non-profit is important in the Internet world where scale is key, but I think in other industries the non-profit strategies should be left to the non-profits.",1208725459

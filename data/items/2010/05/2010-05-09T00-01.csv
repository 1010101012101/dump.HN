Proximal telemetry works only at distances of a few centimeters or less and tends to be limited by the sensitivity of the receivers within the implanted devices.  Only after the authentication and key exchange has occurred in the proximal mode is the distance mode activated, which then affords the users several meters of freedom.<p>The assumption is that a person who can stay close enough to the patient for the length of time required for the devices to bond is implicitly worthy of access.  This is the same assumption that has served the industry well for the past few decades, although before the distance devices, the entire session would be conducted in proximal mode.<p>The bigger risk, as I see it, is that an attacker could successfully impersonate an already-bonded device.  In that situation, neither proximal bonding nor UV passwords would help.",1273365830

""Your apology is worthless"", as in ""Bit.ly, your apology is worthless"". Still, she could've been a bit more tactful.<p>Anyway, this is quite an eye-opening article. What bit.ly is doing is a great example of how <i>not</i> to run a business.

I voted for a smaller party, and they still got two members from my area, so I am represented in our parliament by someone that is both from my area <i>and</i> shares my political views. And so is almost everyone else, regardless of who they voted for.<p>In my opinion, this system is better because you have almost the same benefits as your system with smaller constituencies, but the proportional system doesn't punish smaller parties like yours does. If a party gets 20% of the total vote, they will have about 20% of the seats in parliament as well, which is as it should be.",1273363307

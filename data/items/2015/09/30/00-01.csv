I fully expect that if fingerprint access does become the universal security mechanism used on computing devices we&#x27;ll soon enough have fully automated solutions where law enforcement can either download your fingerprint from their existing database or scan it from any available surface in real time and apply an image to the sensor to fool it into unlocking.

It was always called `th` and took the form of an <i>empty</i> struct.  It turns out, if you pass an empty struct by value and don&#x27;t do anything but pass it along, modern C compilers seem to generate identical byte code as if you removed the argument entirely (obviously, this isn&#x27;t something you could strictly rely on, but it made no difference for correctness only efficiency, and if you&#x27;re at the level where you care about that scale of efficiency you should be verifying all manner of assumptions when moving between compilers!).<p>So now at any given point in any given thread-pinned function, you&#x27;ve got a variable in scope called `th`.  Calling another thread-pinned function on the same thread looks like `foo(th, other, args)`.  If that function isn&#x27;t supposed to run on this thread, you get an error about trying to pass something of type `server_thread_t` as an argument of type `main_thread_t` (or whatever).<p>Controlling data access could be done with getters and setters.  I took a slightly different approach (which I&#x27;m not convinced is better, but it didn&#x27;t cause me any pain this project), which was to define a macro used to declare global data that was bound to a thread, which would mangle the name and also create a no-op checking function.  I had another macro that would take the simple name, check the thread, and resolve to the thing with the mangled name (as an LVAL).  Having called that macro `L`, I now can treat `L(foo)` just as if it were a global variable named `foo`, and at runtime that&#x27;s all it is, but at compile time my access to it is checked.<p>I had a few other macros for putting a &quot;lying&quot; `th` in scope for those places I really needed to cross threads (`CROSSTH` for &quot;I am accessing thread X from thread Y, `BEFORETH` for &quot;I am touching this threads data before any threads were spawned&quot;, &c).<p>Oh, the definition of the `th` argument in functions was baked into a macro so it looked like `int foo(TH(main), int something, char else)`.  `TH` also added some attributes - I know there was `unused`, there might have been others...<p>Hopefully that gives some sense of it.  Let me know if you have further questions! :)",1443572528

Money fools us into thinking in this way because you can save money for a long time and then use it, but that&#x27;s really just a promise from the rest of society that they will eventually do something for you in exchange for what you previously did for them.<p>A certain amount of economic activity has to go towards supporting people in their old age, in order to supply them with food and housing and medical care and whatever else. Money is just how you convince working people to do all these things for retirees. It matters less where the money comes from, and more how much of the overall economy that encompasses, and what that means for non-retired people.<p>First-world countries are seeing massive demographic shifts towards old age, which means vastly more economic activity must go towards sustaining the retired, which means less resources available for other activities like building airliners, mining coal, or filing TPS reports.

This poses a threat to our society as it limits the ability of government agencies to monitor Internet communication for the prevention of terrorism and globalized crime. For example, an increasing number of servers use Transport Layer Security (TLS) as default (not only for transmissions that contain passwords or payment information) and also most modern chat applications encrypt all communication. This increases the cost of protecting society as it becomes necessary to collect the required information at the end points, i.e., either the servers or the clients. This requires agencies to either convince the service providers to make the demanded information available or to deploy a back door on the client system respectively. Both actions are much more expensive for the agencies than collecting unprotected information from the transmission wire.\nFortunately, under reasonable assumptions, it is feasible for agencies to fool users into deploying cryptographic systems that the users believe are secure but that the agencies are able to break.&quot;",1443572005

10300768,comment,10256419,10297985,0,0,simoncion,,,"> Is this the study that assumed that all roof falls were due to installation of solar panels<p>I don&#x27;t know what study that is but it doesn&#x27;t appear to be this one. Scott Alexander&#x27;s blog post links to [0], which takes a completely reasonable approach to calculating the number of deaths due to solar panel installation. Search for &quot;Falls are the leading cause of fatalities in the construction industry.&quot; and read on from there.<p>> Designing reactors is not the problem. Running them safely and building and decommissioning them efficiently is.<p>There have been <i>two</i> accidents that caused serious damage of any kind in nuclear power generation&#x27;s 61 year history, [1] Fukushima and Chernobyl. As I mentioned before, Fukushima was hit by the <i>fifth-largest</i> earthquake <i>ever</i> recorded, and a twenty-foot tsunami, and has managed to only <i>maybe</i> kill two people (those guys died of blood loss, rather than radiation poisoning), and <i>might</i> contribute to ~150 cancer deaths as the years go by. This puts Fukushima&#x27;s <i>worst-case</i> death rate at ~3.75 deaths per year.<p>What&#x27;s more, -as I linked upthread- the area is now producing food that&#x27;s 100% safe to eat. We&#x27;re a <i>substantial</i> way down the road to recovering from the second largest disaster in nuclear power&#x27;s history and it only took <i>four</i> years.<p>An <i>absurdly</i> pessimistic estimate of <i>all</i> deaths and potential deaths due to increased cancer risk related to fission power plant operation over the past 61 years puts the number at ~4,500. Even though this is a silly and inappropriate metric, that&#x27;s ~73 deaths per year. If we look at deaths in just the US, choking on one&#x27;s own food is an <i>order of magnitude</i> more hazardous than that.<p>> ...am I supposed to exclude nuclear explosions from the list of risks of a nuclear reactor?<p>Yes.<p>No power generation reactor has <i>ever</i> undergone a nuclear explosion. No currently operating power generation reactor, nor any such reactor that would be approved for construction <i>can</i> undergo a nuclear explosion. What&#x27;s more, modern reactor designs (that is, reactor designs a fair bit newer than those at Fukushima) fail-safe in <i>any</i> conditions, short of deliberate sabotage by super-strong, radiation-proof superheroes that are able to enter the reactor vessel while it&#x27;s in operation and intelligently tamper with the fuel rods contained within.<p>Not even <i>Chernobyl</i> underwent a nuclear explosion. [2] The explosion at Chernobyl was its steam piping exploding due to overpressure. The Chernobyl reactor was housed in an unhardened structure [4] that was more suited to storing goods and foodstuffs than containing fires and explosions. The steam explosion wrecked the containment structure, allowing the smoke from the flaming irradiated carbon control rods to escape into the surrounding countryside.<p>> You think I want coal?<p>I -charitably- think that you want safe power generation. I don&#x27;t see why you&#x27;re spending so much time and effort on combating something that has -worst case- over <i>61 years</i> killed 15% of the the people power generation with coal-fired plants kills <i>just</i> in the US <i>every</i> single year.<p>Fight the big fights first: Decommission fossil-fuel-powered power plants. Dramatically increase the standards for hydroelectric dam design, construction, and maintenance. Institute programs that ensure that <i>all</i> workers who work at dangerously high elevations are properly secured against falls. Design and deploy helper bots to recognize and deliver aid to those who are choking on their own food.<p>Once all that&#x27;s done, move on to shutting down something that&#x27;s less hazardous than crossing the road or eating one&#x27;s dinner.<p>[0] <a href=""http://nextbigfuture.com/2008/03/deaths-per-twh-for-all-energy-sources.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nextbigfuture.com/2008/03/deaths-per-twh-for-all-ener...</a><p>[1] This is the first commercial power generation fission reactor. It ran from mid 1954 until mid 2002: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obninsk_Nuclear_Power_Plant"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obninsk_Nuclear_Power_Plant</a><p>[2] Even though a undergraduate-level physics student can design a bomb capable of undergoing a nuclear explosion, it requires <i>deliberate</i> effort to design and <i>precise</i> engineering to make such a thing. [3] You <i>cannot</i> turn a fission reactor into a nuclear bomb, unless you <i>remove</i> its fuel rods and use <i>those</i> to make a bomb. But then, we&#x27;re talking about fission reactor safety, not the general safety of fissile materials.<p>[3] Note that a bomb that undergoes a nuclear explosion is <i>very</i> different from a &quot;dirty bomb&quot;. A dirty bomb is made by wrapping conventional explosives with radioactive material. The explosives are used to <i>spread</i> the material around as far as is possible. No nuclear explosion takes place.<p>[4] This was widely regarded as a bad idea at the time. <i>No</i> power generation reactor in operation today is housed in an unhardened structure.",1443571340

In other words, they deliberately misstated cutoff times to create a sense of urgency and discourage shopping around or having second thoughts before hitting submit. WTF?<p>In another instance - they canceled one item from an order, sent no notification of such, and <i>completely erased that item from the order history</i>. I was left scratching my head, until I reviewed emails to see if I really had ordered that item. Again, WTF?<p>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re alright if you&#x27;re constantly ordering things from Prime or whatever because there are more good instances to outweigh the weirdness, combined with their policy of crediting people to keep them happy and avoid breaking the illusion.",1443571331

10300764,comment,10300036,10300532,0,0,geofft,,,"Well, the context here is that &quot;doxing&quot; is not about identity in the first place: it&#x27;s about encouraging harassment/crime, by facilitating identity theft, leaking embarrassing photos, giving contact info of family members, giving the information needed to conduct SWATting, etc. Identity happens to be involved in all of these things, but it&#x27;s not the goal.<p>That section of the book argues for distinguishing them because, in some cases, de-anonymizing someone (but no more) is legitimate self-defense by a community, but doxing always intends harassment (which is not legitimate self-defense). If there are rules for actual war, there are absolutely rules for &quot;war&quot; in scare quotes; not inciting crime is one of them. I don&#x27;t think I can make the full argument here concisely, but it is well set-out in the book. (While she has a blog post saying much the same thing, I actually thought that was a much poorer defense of de-anonymization, since it&#x27;s missing context.)<p>Obviously in this specific case there is not even &quot;war,&quot; just curiosity, so that defense of de-anonymization doesn&#x27;t apply.

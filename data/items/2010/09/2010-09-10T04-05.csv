Grasping the concepts of say, quantum physics, is ridiculously difficult.  Once you fully understand it, it is relatively easy to apply. The principles of negotiation are easy to understand, but very difficult to apply.<p>People in hard sciences are typically elitist because they've had to prove themselves right up front.  Making it through school is a more concrete accomplishment.  Who knows if that psyc major will ever amount to anything.",1284094734

Especially the first two points and the last paragraph.<p>While the third point is important, it doesn't have to be a full presentation. Just have the person talk to everyone on the team for a moment or two[1] about what (s)he did in the previous week, and how (s)he thinks the next week will come along[2]. Maybe a quick demo, if anything big was done.<p>For the fourth point, I can't really say. I was the only intern at the company this summer. I was told about a few programs to get interns from various startups together, but they mostly involved going from SF down to Mountain View. I made the trip once to visit somewhere and its too much of a hassle for me to have wanted to do on a semi-regular basis[3]. I spent the time around the city and met a bunch of other people instead. Still had a blast.<p>1. Just ""Added this and that feature, fixed this and that bug that were assigned as well as a few others that I ran into,"" not anything that takes time to prepare.<p>2.

There are a lot of clever hacks our there. Just because you don't see an implementation of it doesn't mean nobody has played around with the idea already.<p>Aside from that, if you do get a patent and Google infringes on it, what are you going to do? If the answer is ""nothing because I don't have (at least) six figures sitting around to take them to court"", then don't get a patent regardless of whatever other reasons you might have for getting one.

When it's a surprise it's even more fun! I love to see their face light up when they least expect. Great feeling.<p>Now, if we are talking about items for myself, not necessarily of great importance, I do indulge on certain things, but I have rules.<p>I have no problem spending money on well designed items that look, feel, and function properly with the quality I desire. Examples include Macbook Pro with Mac OS X, Apple Cinema Display, Water Field Designs Muzetto and I'll tell you why.<p>First, the Macbook Pro. I used to do Linux as my platform of choice, loved the whole idea of open source, freedom, the platform, the options, and it's abilities. However, I would spend countless hours gettings thing like sleep / hibernate working on my laptop, wireless card setup correctly, tweaking my Fluxbox settings, among other things. It got the  point I started to really value my time spent working (this was before I actually had a career) and doing other things I enjoyed. I didn't have much desire to use Windows for my main system, so I grudgingly invested in my first Apple, a Macbook Pro v1. It was hotter than heck, but I loved it. Things worked! Wireless! Video! And most important to me was sleep and hibernate were flawless! it was amazing.<p>For the Apple Cinema Display, you wouldn't think it would be that big a deal, but it made my desk nearly clear of cables now and the extra power connector made it worth every cent. This is the 24"". Since I have this nice display now, I had now qualms purchasing the 13"" Macbook Pro this time with it's smaller screen (and price). I love the portability of this little guy and not having to take out the power supply and just keep it in my bag, pure luxury. The screen is gorgous too!. My other display is a Dell U2711, I have delegated it video games.<p>Finally, the bag, as many call it, a nearly $300 man purse, the Water Field Designs Muzetto (with sleeve of course). Quite simply the most beautiful bag I have ever owned or seen. I love it to death. It looks great, feels like a tank, is easy to just pick up and go. It gets a little cramped with my iPad, power supply, and Macbook Pro, but that's good otherwise I would jam it full of excess items. It forces me to travel lite. I got the cream. It attracts all sorts of people and I get comments almost everytime I'm out and about with it.<p>That got a little long, so I'll leave it at that.",1284093424

If you aren't <i>predicting</i> enjoyment for something that you <i>will actually enjoy</i> at the time it happens, then your prediction circuits are badly calibrated.<p>If you aren't predicting enjoyment, and you are avoiding doing something (procrastinating), you are probably predicting something bad happening as a result of doing or not doing it, which you force yourself past fighting every time.<p>What am I talking about when I say 'predicting'? Feelings. How you feel about it. Do some role playing imagination for:<p>- If I don't start this now, how do I feel?
- If I never get this done, how do I feel?
- If I do work on it now, how do I feel?
- If I do finish this, how do I feel?<p>(that is, deliberately imagine yourself in each of the situations as if it was really happening, and pay attention to what your brain feeds back to you as you do so by way of noticing how the imagination-model makes you feel).<p>Compare between something that you don't procrastinate on, and something that you do. I'm guessing for something you easily do it will go ""if I don't do it, no big deal, if I do, pride and happiness"", and for something you procrastinate on it will be ""if I don't do it, oh no I feel ashamed, and if I do, just another trudging turn of the grindstone"".<p>Can I justify this from your post? Maybe:<p><i>The things I really care about are things that I want to be perfect, so I put off doing them. Pretty soon, I’ve turned a small, simple task into a huge project and the burden of accomplishing it is just too large, so I put it off. Do I really care about this redesign? Yeah, I care way too much about it.</i><p>Ask yourself what it is that you care about, specifically. It's not really the redesign itself, is it? The ""burden"". People don't describe things they enjoy doing and look forward to as a burden, they describe onerous miserable/unpleasant but obligatory tasks as burdens.<p>You beat yourself up with Fort Knox lockdowns, mental discipline and framing it as something you will have to ""fight forever"" and then write a blog post about how to change yourself so you stop procrastinating by keeping yourself the same and changing the world around you - as if that actually could work. As if having an egg timer near you is the change that stops you procrastinating. As if changing your watch is the fix for bubblesort being too slow.<p>NB, I'm procrastinating by writing this instead of working, but don't dismiss this because of my failings, only dismiss it if it's not useful.",1284091754

I only have a couple of things to finish up before I'll be posting up a Beta for you all to play with.  One of those things, at the insistence of several non-tech but lawyerly family members, is to explore getting a patent.  I rather dislike software patents because I feel they're ripe for trolling/squatting, stifle technological improvements, and I think code resembles more a recipe (non-patentable) than an invention.  That being said, I'm alive in a world where software patents are real, and my dislike for the possibility of somebody stealing my beloved idea [and especially implementation of it] is greater than the grudge I hold against software patents.<p>The technology in question is a customizable toolbar that installs as a bookmarklet.  I'm not comfortable explaining what the toolbar does, but rest assured that it's very, very useful, and definitely a novel idea.  The closest thing I've seen to it is Quix [1], which leaves much to be desired.  What I've made is a remarkable feat of CSS/JS hacking, and I don't want it to be stolen.<p>Aside from the obvious advice of ""ask a lawyer,"" I'm looking for advice about the following:<p>1) Assume my App was ""Quix"" (with some very unique twists)... would it be patentable?  Would it be worthwhile, IYO, to patent it?  (Subquestion: How much protection would a patent grant; could somebody copy it and modify something slightly?)<p>2) Assume I did want to seek a patent, how much of the product could I expose <i>right now</i>? Could I still launch a ""Beta"" or would that be putting it in the public domain?  How about a video?<p>I realize the likelihood of this idea being a measurable success is slim... says you.  Yet, I cannot help but be optimistic about it.  I've demoed it to several family & friends (of varying tech-savviness) and while some are indifferent (but see the value), the majority are excited about it and can't wait to start using it.<p>Finally, thank you all very much for taking the time to help me in what feels like a pivotal point in my life.<p>[1] http://www.quixapp.com",1284091423

It may take 5 steps but may only take 30 seconds per item. Pay with your credit card, attach the printed postage labels, and leave your packages with the USPS.<p>If you use the Dymo just for printing address labels, then not only can you start with the cheapest label maker, but you can use the address label for any purpose.<p>For many daily shipments, you can use a Dymo Label Writer with combined address/postage labels customized for Endicia.<p>Endicia's API, unless they changed it, is an always-on program that checks if a certain file has shipping information in it. If it does, it prints out shipping labels and clears the file.<p>Endicia has excellent support; I believe actual developers answered your questions last I used them.",1201060498

I just get the feeling this might be worth reading, but I don't want to have to find out on my own.  I would upvote anyone who read it and found out (I don't think this is a bribe; whoever reads that legitimately deserves a karma point).",1201060385

If there was software which was safety critical (maybe NASA code), then I'm sure that the developers would have the same kind of ethics.<p>I'm a power systems engineer involved in designing offshore oil and gas facilities. We frequently have to shoot down dangerous hare-brained schemes from clients who want to save a little cash. Thank god for the national standards though, they usually back us up.

That might mean trying to live as long as possible, uploading your mind to a computer, spreading memes as a way of spreading your mind piecemeal, or writing and art as a way to leave a footprint.<p>Of course, it would be good to get your cake and eat it too; it might someday be possible to calibrate your brain's reward system so it rewards whey protein instead of trans fats, say.  It might be possible to stop the negative feedback mechanism that regulates dopamine levels.  If you could permanently increase dopamine levels, you could be happy ever after.",1201059521

Laws have been proposed requiring companies to report on privacy breaches, but I don't think they require companies to say <i>why</i> the breach happened, and they don't require an outside audit.<p>The ROC project suggested something similar, although their analogy was not to the NTSB but an internal Ma Bell policy that required a report to be written for all outages. However, most companies don't want to release details about their outages, especially ones that are not customer-visible. When companies do talk about outages (as Joel just did) it's usually as a form of PR damage control.<p><a href=""http://roc.cs.berkeley.edu/#pubs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roc.cs.berkeley.edu/#pubs</a>",1201058432

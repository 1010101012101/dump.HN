That is enough time for me to talk with the customer, scope out a problem, give them quick, simple advice, and prepare a quote.  It is a good idea because it keeps lines of communication open and it makes sure I am in the loop when something goes wrong.  At the same time 10-15 min is also enough time I can get informed consent for paid work and it's a nice value add.<p>It works well for me, actually.

What matters is how the organization/community deals with such cases as they come along. If what the article says about this rogue trustee is true, then he needs to be fired, and fired hard, to send a message to the rest of the organization and its many international branches.<p>I can understand why Wikipedia <i>the project</i> generally does not want to make top-down changes, but Wikimedia <i>the foundation</i> needs strong leadership in order to avoid corruption among its ranks. With great power comes great responsibility, and it cannot be denied that Wiki[pm]edia has gained great power in today's world, whether intended or not. There must be rules. Those rules must be written down and enforced consistently. Yes, that will lead to bureaucracy, but bureaucracy tends to become necessary when your organization reaches a certain level of complexity.<p>I'm not sure who (if anyone) is in charge of granting and revoking ""Residence"" status, but that person needs to be dealt with, too, and swiftly, and harshly, if the allegations have merit. ""Paid PR"" is a vague concept, but openly advertising profit-motivated wiki-editing services is clearly unacceptable by the cultural standards of Wikipedia. If the community can demonstrate that it can enforce discipline even upon its most highly esteemed members, there is no reason to suppose that this incident will be a net loss for Wiki[pm]edia in the long term.<p>Fortunately, it shouldn't be too difficult to find out who made which edits.",1348037688

But this phone, carved from aluminum, should be extremely rugged. The chamfer polish (not the geometry) is ornamental, but beyond that it's a purely functional expression. Apple didn't say, ""Hey, Aluminum's pretty, let's make a phone out of it!""

If only there were more useful articles like this and less flaming.<p>You wrote ""...in MySQL, the application is king and the db a humble servant."" That is exactly my experience, and it leads not only to terrible databases but to piles of awful code written around terrible databases. In 1974 Kernighan and Plauger wrote ""Choose a data representation that makes your program simple"" (Elements of Programming Style). Other esteemed programmers have said the same thing. A well-designed and normalized database schema with validations and access rules implemented in the database will reduce the amount of application code needed.<p>I've written about keeping data management code in the database where it belongs (<a href=""http://typicalprogrammer.com/?p=101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://typicalprogrammer.com/?p=101</a>), but you make a much clearer argument with real examples. A few years ago the Ruby on Rails people championed the idea of ""application databases"" and writing HTTP+XML APIs, which probably seemed like a great idea given that few, if any, Rails applications ever had databases that other applications needed to access. Now the NoSQL folks have taken this even further, eliminating structure from the data and all ACID compliance, separating the data from integrity enforcement, all in the name of scalability problems their app might have if they get as big as Google.<p>I am stuck with MySQL most of the time because I work with broken web applications, and so far all but a couple have used MySQL.

4542390,comment,4538187,4539390,1,0,cbsmith,,,"I think the notion that poor product design can evolve from abuse of data is an interesting discussion, but unfortunately a) it probably isn't poor product design (what function <i>would</i> you put in the areas of the screen most likely to suffer a misclick?) and b) not at all likely due to optimizing click-throughs. Ironically, the misclick problem is a well known issue in online advertising, and the best way to mitigate it <i>is</i> to use the data to dampen the noise.<p>There are obviously a number of ad revenue driven pressures on Yahoo Mail's design. The display advertising market is very different from the search engine market. It is only tangentially about the clicks. The biggest pressures are:<p>""Premium Locations"": these aren't necessarily the places that get high click throughs, but rather the locations which are prominently displayed and noticed by the users, which causes them to stand out in a world awash in banner ads. This competes with good UI design, which wants to put important functions in these exact same locations.<p>""CPM"": just getting way higher impression counts. This translates to filling the screen with as many ads as possible, stealing screen real estate and really disrupting eye flow.<p>""CPA"": Lots of ad networks/DSP's try to arbitrage between CPM and CPA. Misclicks don't generally help much with that beyond hindering optimization efforts to use clicks as signals. Mostly what this does to design is encourage ""rest points"" in applications where users are likely to actually take the time to go all the way through to a conversion (think of it like TV commercial breaks in sports).<p>""Uniques/F-Cap"": You want to raise the bar on the minimum # of impressions seen by every visitor, because those early impressions are far more likely to be people who haven't seen the ad before. Advertisers pay a lot more (10x more is not unheard of) for that. So, there is pressure to spam the visitor with as many impressions as possible before they are likely to leave (which makes it hard to serve ads in a way that is proportional to the value the user derives from the experience).<p>""View based conversion"": The underbelly of the adverting network. In theory this is a good thing. In practice, it creates an incentive to shove ad locations in to the page that the visitor never even notices (ironically the opposite of the problem the article contends).<p>Some people have apparently gotten the impression I was questioning your credentials, your intelligence, or somehow attacking you personally. At least in terms of intent it couldn't be farther from the truth! While I think your navet about online advertising undermines <i>your article</i>, all it might imply about <i>you personally</i> is your curiosity about online advertising is low as compared to other pursuits. If anything, I'd say that is a compliment. If I conveyed or you perceived anything other than that, I certainly apologize.",1348035598

When you are trying to Rule Your Realm, losing money in not a very good way to do it! As an entrepreneur, its important to know what your strengths and weakness are. This way you can either work on those weaknesses or hire someone else to do those things. Believe me, I know!<p>There was a bad habit that I had to fight for years that literally has cost me thousands upon thousands of dollars. What was that habit? It was doing things for free and not liking to charging my customers and clients. Although, I did like getting paid, I didnt like quoting prices or asking for money. That may sound weird to some of you, but there you have it, that was my struggle! See, Im not a greedy person and I enjoy helping people, which are great qualities to have as an entrepreneur, but when its all said and done, you have to get paid! You have bills to pay just like everyone else!<p>It wasnt until I came to the realization that every time I did something for free, or I did a free coaching session, or quoted a very low price on a job, I was really robbing my family!! I was making it harder on my family, all because I didnt like charging people! I realized not only am I making it harder on my family, but I am not Ruling My Realm in my business or finances..<p>So here is what I did<p>First, I decided I was going to charge people what I am worth. I think its very important to know how much your time is worth. Because most of us start out by having jobs, we can get used to others dictating how much we are worth. But, not anymore!! We get to choose now! I do recommend doing some research first and finding out what the standard rate is for someone in your Industry, that way you have an idea of what people are used to paying for your products or services. You have to value what you offer, because if you dont No one else will either!<p>Next, I put an end to allowing people to Pick My Brain for free. It absolutely amazes me the mindset of the masses. Now this is not a put down, but it is true and you need to be aware of what you are up against. I am always amazed by that amount of people that want to pick my brain about this Social Media strategy or that Facebook ad tactic, plus the ones that want me to do a whole job for them for free! I dont know about you, but I dont think I could get away with that if I walked up to a doctor, a surgeon or even a mechanic and expected them to give me free advice or a free service! I guess it could be worth a shot, but it normally just doesnt work that way. But, because we are dealing with more intellectual property and online stuff, peoples mentality seem to skip over the fact that this is how we make our living! Dont you think your expertise you have worked so hard for is worth more than a cup of coffee!?<p>I am all about offering value for free, but whatever that value is that you are giving away for free needs to be done strategically. That way you can still give out good stuff and pay your bills!<p>The third thing I did which really helped was, I setup a proposal and billing system that forced people to see how much I charge and when their payment was due. There are a lot of cool billing systems out there, you can check out Freshbooks and Ballpark just to name a couple.<p>Implementing just those three things really helped me get over my discomfort of quoting and billing people. If we are going to Rule Our Realm and make a difference on this planet, we need money to do it! Otherwise, its just a hobby.<p>Keep on Ruling!\nPaul Cooley",1348035347

The article is based on the reasonable premise that a bigger dispute resolution system contributes to GDP to a point, then starts hurting the economy beyond a certain point.<p>Note bene: you say ""in 1994"" as if we should assume the problem has been getting worse over time, but in reality the size of the legal sector as a %-age of real GDP has been decreasing since it peaked in the late 1980's: <a href=""http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/.a/6a00e55044cbaf883401543574d918970c-400wi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/.a/6a00e55044cbaf883401543574d...</a>",1348035266

You can see this in the second video, it is the red dot in the computer model.

If you're saying that all smartphones at this level are luxurious then why do you care that the term 'jewelry' is being thrown around?<p>Sorry, I'll try to explain more clearly. I'm saying the build quality of Apple products, especially iPhones, is far higher than that of other phones, and is in that respect inherently luxurious. So luxurious, in fact, that it's only natural to be afraid of damage.<p>> Your point makes less sense to me. When has metal been lees durable than plastic? Metals traditionally dent and plastic cracks. I view the latter as being far worse.<p>It's not about the material. It's about what the wear does to the aesthetic quality of the phone. To use a different example, compare a jeep to a BMW. I'm not afraid of aesthetic damage to the jeep, because it's built for that, and built in such a way as to wear the damage well. Not so for the BMW. (Car analogies always work, right?)",1348034771

Had a MacBook and a much less expensive PC laptop from the same generation in the house; I'm still loving the MacBook, while the PC is long forgotten.<p>Even bigger effect with the iPhone. That one looked impressive from the start, but it made a world of a difference to actually hold one in your hand.<p>The iPhone 4 had the Retina display, and so that time the nerds were actually salivating over it, because the higher resolution could finally be expressed as a number and put in a chart. Nah, just kidding, the nerds were adamant that nobody needed that many pixels anyway, and preferred to argue about the ""Retina"" monicker. As for myself: waited until I saw it in person, was blown away again.<p>I'm not going to buy an iPhone 5. My iPhone 4 is still serving me fine. But from past experience, I know that the only good way to evaluate an iPhone is to actually hold it in your hand and use it. That's why I'm more interested in the impressions of a  Gruber holding an iPhone 5 than in those of a bean-counter holding an iPhone 5 data sheet.<p>PS: just a small concession to the specs game: are you sure ""the S3 beats the pants off the iPhone 5""? If you do a google search, you'll find as many people saying the 5 beats the S3 as those who say the opposite. Geekbench scores for the S3 are all over the place (check the browser). Then there's the question of whether most apps can scale to a 4-core processor as well as Geekbench does. And then there's the fact that the iPhone 4 performed much better in practice than higher-clocked Android phones of the same era.

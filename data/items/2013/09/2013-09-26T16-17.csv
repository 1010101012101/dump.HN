Normally, the browser will remember the HSTS response for a period of time. Clearly, a correctly implemented private mode breaks this, and thus breaks HSTS.<p>However, Google and Mozilla are also pre-loading HSTS information. There was a blog post from Mozilla some months ago, describing how they have a crawler that detects long-term HSTS configuration in popular sites and then ships that information with browser releases. In this case, HSTS will work as intended even in private mode.",1380214787

I know it doesn&#x27;t require massive hardware or anything like that because it doesn&#x27;t involve breaking the encryption.<p>My original point is twofold:<p>First, having encrypted/unauthenticated communication is still better because it takes <i>more</i> effort to intercept, while doing so for unencrypted/unauthenticated is trivial (e.g. Google&#x27;s WiFi sniffing debacle).<p>Second, encrypted/unauthenticated can be implemented to be almost completely transparent (for example, server and browser do a key exchange on every request; kind of how gzip compression is automatic), whereas encrypted/authenticated requires certificates (which you have to pay for, renew, copy on your server, etc.).<p>Right now X% of sites use HTTPS and (100 - X)% don&#x27;t. It would be best if 100% of sites used HTTPS. But using _some_ form of encryption for the (100 - X)% is better than nothing, and more achievable than saying &quot;encryption-only is useless, everyone should use authentication as well&quot;.<p>(I can&#x27;t find any stats for HTTPS usage, hence the variables.)",1380214510

Meanwhile, in some other town that happened to be more aligned with increasing demands for human labor (Silicon Valley) people are getting richer. When those peopl visit the small town, their income dwarfs the town&#x27;s inhabitants&#x27; income.<p>All this is mitigated somewhat when a town can issue its own currency. But if they are forced to use the country&#x27;s fiat currency, they may start defaulting on their loans. This can explain what happened with the PIGS countries&#x27; economies after they joined the EU for example.<p>In any event, the income disparity pushes some people around (making them move) . There is an ever greater amount of people unable to earn enough to leave their small town to a &quot;booming center&quot; without significant risk. Those who do are willing to put up with worse conditions in order to get a chance at the big bucks. This happened for 10 years in the Great Depression as farmers migrated to the cities and our country transitioned to be dominated by industrial sector. A sector which has been disrupted in the last 30-40 years much as the agricultural sector was before.<p>However, even with all that, a growing &quot;underclass&quot; of people becomes less economically significant. For example why develop vaccines for them? The overall pictureis that automation increasingly favors the capitalists over the wage laborers. One of the best ways that has worksd to mitigate this is to decentralize the capital, eg have wordpress and linux instead of facebook and windows. Patents work against this, though.",1380213797

I think co-founders are over-rated.<p>> You need to have someone in the team that can fix a crashed server at 3am, or burn the midnight oil to hit a new feature deadline.<p>Almost every contractor I&#x27;ve worked with on elance has been willing to work whatever hours were required. For $5 an hour. Why give up precious equity for something you could hire out for a few dollars an hour?<p>> To date I have been using a contractor to build Satago, and whilst he is very good (one of the best developers Ive worked with to be honest, but sadly based very far away from me in Russia) the fear is that without the large chunk of equity that a co-founder would be working towards, he could just down tools, and then Satago would grind to a halt.<p>If I were you I would find a few other good developers to work with. Elance has them in abundance and they&#x27;ll be more than happy to work for you at $5-$10/hr. (I prefer fixed-budget projects, personally.)<p>Here&#x27;s how I get projects done: I take a few INDEPENDENT features from the product roadmap, set clear expectations with the developers, hand off the code, iterate, finalize, then pay my main developer to integrate their code into the main code-base. In my case I&#x27;m the lead developer so I do the code integration, in your case maybe it would be your contractor from Russia.<p>If the developers I&#x27;ve hired write good code and deliver as promised I keep them. If they don&#x27;t I move on to someone else. In one year I&#x27;ve gone through 6 developers and kept 2 of them. 2 competent, hard working, reliable developers.<p>When I said &quot;set clear expectations&quot;, some expectations I&#x27;ve found useful to establish with a contractor are: clearly define the project specifications (you need to be able to tell them exactly what needs to be done), clearly define the project deadlines (first iteration due in 2 weeks), clearly define the budget ($300 for features X, Y, and Z), and clearly define the communication requirements (respond to emails within 24 hours, provide constant work status updates). It&#x27;s also a good idea to let them know that you&#x27;re looking for developers with whom you can establish a long-term relationship and that this small project they&#x27;re about to work on is a test. If they meet your expectations you will keep working with them, if they don&#x27;t you won&#x27;t be repeating business.<p>I also make sure to tell them that the code needs to be thoroughly documented. It helps the other developers who have to work with their code and it could help you get an idea of what&#x27;s going on under the hood.<p>In summary, I think technical co-founders are over-rated. I see no reason to give up equity for something that can be easily contracted out. Ok, finding good contractors isn&#x27;t &quot;easy&quot;. It takes a lot of time -- it&#x27;s taken me 9 months to find 2 solid ones. But the ones I&#x27;ve found can reliably get the job done, on time, within budget, guaranteed.

There have now been many predictions made for times now in the past based on the same climate models being used to predict disaster, and they are now almost uniformly wrong.<p>The Met Office in Britain is one of the clearest. Are they predicting a wet summer for Britain? Brits should buy suntan lotion. Are they predicting a hot, dry summer? Brits should plant something that likes wet, dark conditions. They are the source of one of the models in the IPCC report, and they&#x27;re predictions for a year or two out are wrong, consistently.<p>And I find the idea that a climate model can&#x27;t predict a year in advance, <i>consistently</i>, but can be used for 10 or 100 years in advance to be absolutely ludicrous. Utter mathematical illiteracy is required to think that is true of a chaotic system. It remains unclear to me whether climate researchers actually understand that &quot;a chaotic system&quot; is actually a mathematically meaningful statement and not &quot;an excuse for why we were wrong, <i>again</i>&quot;. (No sarcasm, it truly remains unclear to me. Chaos theory is a real thing, and I&#x27;d really like to think that climate researchers would know a lot about it, but I&#x27;ve only seen faint traces of it, where I expect the terminology to dominate the discourse.)<p>Given the utter failure of these predictions on a year and a decade scale (as I&#x27;ve said before, had the climate scientists said &quot;hey, there&#x27;s going to be a 15-year plateau because of this and this which will mask the problem but then this is going to happen&quot;, I&#x27;d be fine with that), I see no reason to believe they&#x27;ll work on a century scale.<p>At the moment, the most reasonable explanation is that the models used by the IPCC up to this point have been <i>grossly</i> wrong about their positive heating feedback claims, which if you dig, were never really that well substantiated by actual <i>evidence</i>, they have <i>always</i> been modeling choices. In the real science world, those claims are being walked back quite rapidly with a variety of peer reviewed studies providing both evidence of this and potential models for explanations; this has not penetrated to the political portion of the AGW crowd yet. This is probably because the science, to my eyes, is rapidly converging on &quot;global warming is unlikely to be a problem in this century, and may even be a net benefit to humanity&quot;.

Or make do with less for, say, a year (very unlikely given she doesn&#x27;t really care enough about handsets).<p>Her alternatives are to take the contract and handset bundle or to buy the handset on credit.

(My broker fired me for that)<p>I&#x27;m going to hold on to those bonds as long as I can,  and I&#x27;d much rather borrow against the equity of the &quot;home&quot; I own at a lower rate.  (I bought the home in cash,  so this is my &quot;first&quot; mortgage -- I opened the account when I wanted some capital to take a chance at buying an adjoining property at a tax auction.)<p>One of the first things I did when I quit was write a check from the heloc to the HSA so I wouldn&#x27;t have to think about making contributions for it.<p>It&#x27;s a little more complex than that because I have two houses on one large lot and my wife&#x27;s riding academy and the rental income creates a financial situation that&#x27;s so sweet it&#x27;s almost a scam.  I think last year I got $16k of rent,  experienced a positive cashflow of around $14k from it,  but the IRS says we made $4.5k of income because of depreciation on our property.<p>(I have no idea why anybody buys a single family house;  as much as muggles make a big deal of the mortgage interest deduction,  owning a duplex means you can write off half the principal plus you get a cash flow to help w/ the mortgage and property taxes.  Maybe you even get a cool neighbor.)<p>One key to making this work is that I can get a high deductible health insurance plan through COBRA for $500 a month and that will tide me through until Obamacare comes unless the Republicans defund it.  That&#x27;s important because there really isn&#x27;t any such thing as individual health insurance in NY.  (I&#x27;d better write that letter to my Republican congressman before I forget.)<p>Anyhow,  it isn&#x27;t all roses.  I pay $4k a year in taxes for a &quot;persistently dangerous&quot; school that my son goes to where probably 1/2 of the parents w/ college educations don&#x27;t send their kids to because they homeschool.  They haven&#x27;t had a principal last more than two years so long as I know.<p>The internet sucks out here too.  Github works OK,  but it took 30 seconds to create a trouble ticket with the off-brand project management software at my last job,  which was one of the reasons I quit.  Netflix and Amazon instant video work,  but I can&#x27;t really watch Youtube.

You&#x27;re totally right, there&#x27;s a lot of complexity when you&#x27;re testing complex features in a huge app.<p>Buuuuut, a huge complex app is probably not the right place to try learning any new technology. Do a few small things first, prototype something out, test it along the way. Then maybe something a little more complicated. Slowly expand your horizon of uncertainty.<p>That way you only need to focus on learning one thing at a time. The assert() call that OP suggested is exactly enough to start thinking about testing simple code; once you&#x27;re doing well at it, you can start noticing repetition and opportunities for abstraction (and finding existing libraries that have these abstractions already done for you); then, you start doing testing on more complex code and start learning about mocks to facilitate testing there.<p>Some people do really well in a &quot;big bang&quot; kind of learning environment, but I definitely don&#x27;t. For me, learning works best given: a rough map of where I&#x27;m trying to get (even just a mind map that gives me things to look up when I get stuck), and an opportunity to master each piece before expanding onto new topics.",1380211372

6451653,comment,6449816,6450077,4,0,hackula1,,,"> You can&#x27;t leave your brain at work if your job is mostly mental work.<p>Trust me, you can. I simply ignore emails after 6pm. I will look at them first thing at 8am the next day, but not after 6. If someone presses you on it and they won&#x27;t take &quot;I have a life&quot; for an answer, just lie and say you didn&#x27;t see it or that you were at your kid&#x27;s baseball game. I suspect that the frequency of someone&#x27;s boss actually getting pissed that they did not respond right away to a 9pm email to be extremely low.  In the unlikely occurrence that you actually work in an environment like this, I suggest polishing up the resume, because there are plenty of jobs out there that do not require your brain 24/7.",1380211343

Sparrows and bats, being birds and mammals, respectively, would likely have a common ancestor with less in common between the two than sparrows and pigeons or bats and ferrets, correct?<p>I&#x27;m no expert in evolutionary science beyond the basics, so correct me if I am wrong.

I didn&#x27;t realize (I&#x27;m sure most wouldn&#x27;t know) that Amazon is basically forcing people to price ebooks at 9.99. At prices < $10, Amazon gives 70%. At prices > $10, Amazon gives 35%.<p>I had planned to initially offer my book at $9.99, and then raise the price to $14.99. Unfortunately, I&#x27;d basically have to stop offering Amazon as a vendor, or at the very least stop advertising it as one on my site. I may or may not do that at some point, but it&#x27;s frustrating to say the least that I don&#x27;t have control of the pricing of my product.

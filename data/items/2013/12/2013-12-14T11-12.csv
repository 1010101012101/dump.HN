6905446,comment,6903450,6905266,4,0,h-eriks,,,"In my mind there should be a refund from Steam either way:<p>- If Steam has a thorough quality control, they (sort of) tell you that the game is OK, no obvious bugs. But there could still exist a serious bug that you can find, and I think they should give you a refund. They said it would work and it didn&#x27;t.<p>- If there&#x27;s no quality control to speak of (i.e. they just sell whatever the developers are shipping) and it turns out to be crap, it&#x27;s still Steam who has sold it to you. In my mind they should still give you a refund, apologize a bit, and then deal with the developer.<p>I can&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s Steam&#x27;s responsibility to test the game, but it&#x27;s in their interest to provide high quality, so they ought to do some smoke tests at the very least. But no testing (from Steam and/or the developer) can guarantee that there&#x27;s no problem with the software, and if there is, I think it&#x27;s obvious that Steam should handle the refunds to the customer (since it&#x27;s Steam&#x27;s customer), and then Steam should handle it with the developer.",1387022298

As far as I know that&#x27;s what bribing is pretty much anywhere else. So US has in effect legalized bribing, and almost everyone in US seems to think that&#x27;s &quot;normal&quot; and okay, and that there&#x27;s &quot;little corruption&quot; in US, when in fact the whole government wreaks of &quot;legalized&quot; corruption.<p>Does that happen in other countries, too? Sure. Bribing is everywhere. But at least we see it for what it is, and even if we don&#x27;t catch them in the act, there can be investigations later, and have them arrested. Good luck doing that in US - ever.",1387020757

We all like to trick ourselves into thinking we&#x27;re unique snowflakes (this problem extends into our personal lives as well). But more often than not, when multiple popular standards emerge, it&#x27;s because there are <i>legitimate engineering tradeoffs</i> that are being made.<p>JSON vs. XML? XML is far more capable but complex. JSON is far simpler but less capable. Sometimes when you&#x27;re delivering value to customers, you need that extra complexity, so you use XML. Other times you don&#x27;t need it so you use JSON. It has nothing to do with ego or politics. Multiple different JSON libraries? One may prioritize ease of use to get up and running, the other may prioritize strong typing for serialization speed. One may prioritize strict compliance with the spec, the other might prioritize speed above all else. JSON vs. a binary format? JSON is  more readily compatible and easier to debug. Binary is faster but more complex to setup. It goes on and on.<p>Again, sometimes competing standards or libraries or languages emerge because of political or capitalistic concerns. But usually when you&#x27;re talking about competing open standards, there are multiple because there are legitimate engineering tradeoffs being made because engineering is not a one-size-fits-all science. (Few sciences are, otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t still have people working on them.)<p>When an open source project rejects a contribution, or five projects exist to solve the same problem, they&#x27;re often making legitimate engineering tradeoffs that are in no way arbitrary, and any one project would suffer to try to be every thing to every person. The article in question doesn&#x27;t even point out a single example of a set of standards or libraries that are entirely arbitrary in their differences or could be collapsed into one solution, which further highlights how this is a theoretical argument, not a practical one.",1450348766

It&#x27;s an expression of the mind, and as a nice side benefit, the ability to communicate explicit commands to tireless machines to act on our behalf. There have been a couple of long, recorded speeches that I need to transcribe (for searchability and research purposes) and so I&#x27;ve been checking out the various speech-to-text APIs (Watson and Oxford) as a first step (e.g. before sending it to Mechanical Turk) in automating the process. The APIs are so easy to tinker with that I thought it&#x27;d be fun to pass in clips of Malcolm Tucker to see how well the APIs did. Then I remembered the IDEA project (a collection of audio of people all around the world with various accents attempting to read English) and thought it&#x27;d be interesting to gauge which accents are the hardest for machines to figure out...and all it takes is some scripting to automate the feeding of these recorded clips into the APIs (the analysis is tricky because of the high variance in audio quality, never mind the accents themselves). All of this is useful in figuring out a solution to my original problem, except it&#x27;s a lot more fun and I get to think a lot more about how language works.<p>If I weren&#x27;t a programmer? I&#x27;d set aside a day, brew some coffee, and manually do the tedious work of transcription by re-listening to those speeches several times over just to get them into a text format. How boring.<p>Yeah, programming can be difficult, but it is completely the right level of difficulty for the power it gives us. Even the things that make me nearly throw my laptop into the wall -- such as string encoding -- are a result of something kind of wonderful...the attempt at having an automated, standardized way to translate every squiggle among the hundreds of human languages, and cultural quirks, too, such as a pile of poo.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve said anything the OP would disagree with. But I kind of checked out after he got into ranting about JavaScript, as if the world needed more bundles of words that insinuate that programming == web development. Things could be smoother, and they are getting that way because of how programming coordinates the flow and storage of information and assertions...but a lot of the OP&#x27;s essay is not much more useful than someone ranting about how literacy sucks because we all can&#x27;t agree what makes for great literature these days.",1450346980

And yet, by quoting the people who were actually right in the cases they wrote about, it appears more correct than it is.<p>There are too many wrong &quot;conclusions&quot; and premises in the text, just an example, here&#x27;s the author writing about Babbage&#x27;s and his Analytical Machine:<p>&quot;he was focused on doing math fast and without errors. He didn’t care how complex the machine was as long as it accomplished that.&quot;<p>Of course, not true, Babbage had to care. He was designing a purely mechanical machine for years at the time when nobody had electrical logical circuits. He designed the simplest &quot;universal enough&quot; machine in the limits of the technology of his time. And the design was never built. But to claim that his design was &quot;too complex&quot; the author would have to design a significantly simpler one under the same limitations and goals.<p>The whole article is, unfortunately, like this. Uses something that actually happened or somebody did say, &quot;concludes&quot; something else.

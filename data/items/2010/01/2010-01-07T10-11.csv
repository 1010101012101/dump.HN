1036837,comment,1034087,1035133,0,0,vidarh,,,"I don't consider it a dev box as much as a box intended to satisfy Amiga hobbyists, some of which may use it for development, but a lot of which just want a non-x86 box running AmigaOS at decent speeds... Keep in mind that the people behind this are long time Amiga supporters - they're not in this for the sake of the XCore.<p>For the people who <i>are</i> interested in the XCore, it's cheap to buy USB attached dev-board, so this only really matters if you want to play with a system that <i>may</i> have significantly tighter integration (we don't really know yet how tight).<p>For the Amiga community, an x86 box would've been a non-starter. The people in the most likely buying segment for this box are people that have stuck to ancient ""classic"" Amigas, or at best upgraded to sub 1GHz single-core PowerPC boards running newer versions of AmigaOS, that they've paid more for than what you'd pay for a quad core 2GHz+ x86 box. Most of them would've been happy with ""just"" another PowerPC machine, but the XCore adds some extra excitement and may entice a few ex-Amigans like me to have a go for the fun too.<p>> PS: 1x Xorro slot with a card that's 102400 MIPS is fast. An example of number crunching would be real time encoding of super? HD (4x 1080p). Or a custom high bandwidth router etc.<p>The 102400 MIPS is an example based on a hypothetical card that doesn't exist, though.<p>For comparison, XMOS themselves sells a roughly 25000 MIPS experimental board for $1500, so while you can make it fast, it'd also be fairly expensive and it does require a new product.<p>I <i>am</i> excited about having the XCORE chip there, and I may buy an X1000 (who am I kidding, I will buy one unless the price is absolutely outrageous), but I <i>am</i> an ex-Amiga guy and would buy it in part because I still really love the whole Amiga experience, without any illusion that I couldn't do most of the same things on a PC much cheaper in most instances.<p>When it comes to the XCORE what excites me about it, rather than performance, is that it will be standard. In other words, (the few) people who write Amiga software can soon reasonably rely on having it available in the computers of most users of their software. People are already thinking up all kinds of bizarre uses for it.",1262861781

1036833,comment,1036643,1036676,0,0,CyberFonic,,,"The most convenient way to have config files is to have a sensible default value for everything.  So as much as possible the program should run in spite of config errors.  If that is not possible, then the diagnostics need to be very explicit.<p>Any code, e.g. startup scripts should be ideally in a separate file.  In the *NIX tradition these are usually of the form .foorc where 'foo' is the name of the app, and the '.' hides the file from normal directory listings.  Ideally, it would be nice to pre-parse such startup code and only execute if it is syntactically correct.",1262861086

Have you talked to VISA ?<p>They might be able to give you pointers about which parties can handle the functionality you are looking for, they usually keep pretty good tabs on their IPSPs and gateways so they should be able to tell you.",1262861081

1036826,comment,1036361,1036808,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""You probably want to look at examples where this has been done and try to abstract a method out of those.""<p>Robert Silverberg in his essay "" The Making of a Science Fiction Writer"" (originally published in ""Worlds of Wonder"" and later in ""Reflections and Refractions - Thoughts on Science Fiction, Science and Other Matters"") explains in great detail (40 pages in my edition of R&R) how he used stories of writers he admired as  raw material for extracting the principles of  ""how to write well"" (enough to be be awarded the Hugo and Nebula and sell everything he wrote) and the results of his applying these perceived principles to write stories embodying each technique.<p>Quoting from azgolfer's comment above, ""In music, one huge factor is copying people. Stevie Ray Vaughan not only knew every Albert King lick, he knew them well enough to use them in new ways. To be a good musician, you need vocabulary and facility. Learning to play other peoples licks will help you with both.""<p>Silverberg copied writers he admired. But the principle is the same - study a ""work"" that has already achieved your desired outcome, extract a principle or technique by analysis, embody it in <i>your</i> work, get real world feedback on its effectiveness. Rinse, repeat.<p>Caveat: I am not very sure how this would apply to entrepreneurship.",1262860501

1036820,comment,1036509,1036664,0,0,andrew1,,,"I'm no great fan of unions in general but teaching unions do provide important advice, support and representation to teachers. There have been enough cases of teachers being wrongly sacked over false claims by children of abuse etc. that I can understand teachers wanting to belong to an organisation which will help defend them if they're ever in that situation. You could argue that that could happen in any profession - I could be wrongly accused of stealing from the office I work in - but child abuse is a more sensitive issue than most and schools can feel pressured to appear to be 'protecting children' and perhaps more cynically to not want to take the risk of a repeat incident bringing more bad publicity.",1262859934

1036808,comment,1036361,1036576,0,0,cwb,,,"I don't. It's an excellent question though.<p>There may be literature out there on this -- please tell me if you know of
any.<p>You probably want to look at examples where this has been done and try to
abstract a method out of those. Neil Strauss's <i>The Game</i> (about pick-up
artists) is a marvellous example. And Colvin explains in <i>Talent is
Overrated</i> how Abraham Lincoln deliberately practiced writing by analysing,
simplifying, and trying to reproduce others' writing.<p>If I were to attempt an answer, I'd try something along these lines:<p>1. Figure out what an excellent outcome is.<p>For writing, this might be a collection of articles/books. Tricker for
entrepreneurship. Are Page and Brin examples of excellence for
entrepreneurship? Could you model them and be successful without being in the
specific situation they were in? Is Branson a better example? Is it likelihood
of success, imapct, or profit that you want to optimise? It's worth noting
that many things that have a tradition of deliberate practice -- chess, music,
and sports -- have simple measures of excellence (win, make it sound nice,
win).<p>2. Break out the outcome aspects that matter.<p>Good writing not only has clear and lucid prose, but a storytelling structure
that engages and entertains the reader. Entrepreneurship involves, amongst
other things, identifying a solution, producing the solution, marketing to
customers and investors, inspiring employees.<p>3. Compile specific examples of the aspects.<p>Get articles with excellent prose and books with excellent stories. This is
harder for entrepreneurship, but probably doable.<p>4. Modify the specific examples into exercises.<p>Rewrite the article into bullet points so that you can later write the prose
from those. Split the story into pieces and write on cards so you can later
practice arranging the story. Specify the requirements for a web-app that's a
solution to a problem so that you can practice implementing it from that.<p>5. Perform the exercises and evaluate your performance. Repeat.<p>This is where the deliberate practice takes place (though performing these
steps can also be a form of deliberate practice -- for meta-understanding of
performance improvement in the field). The time-span of each exercise can vary
enormously -- from seconds to months (for some things that can't be easily
simulated).<p>Of course, this process should be iterated and refined. I think it would be
much easier to do this with a partner that have similar goals.<p>What are your thoughts on this?",1262858556

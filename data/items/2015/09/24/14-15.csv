Imagine if you worked at VW and your boss told you to make a change which affected safety, emissions, etc. – how different might your reaction be if you know that if you refused or reported it to the appropriate regulators and there were repercussions the Bitpackers Guild could provide legal representation and expert witnesses for you, stage a strike where no licensed engineer would work for an irresponsible company, or simply ensure a lot of publicity? Suddenly it&#x27;s not “go lean on Sally until she gives the engineering sign-off. She can&#x27;t afford to quit until her kid&#x27;s out of college” but “do we want a team of professional engineers to hold a press conference saying we&#x27;re cutting corners over our experts&#x27; judgement?”<p>There are certainly potential downsides but … anyone who drives a car, uses medical equipment, etc. might reasonably conclude they&#x27;re worth it, particularly if the system was structured to focus on transparency and due process rather than the pathology some unions are prone to where members are always defended even when they&#x27;re in the wrong.",1443106746

SF has a large budget for such a small city, but SF just can&#x27;t solve this problem for the nation at large.  People who are frustrated with these efforts argue that our services will never make things better because we simply attract more homeless people by offering them.  I&#x27;ve read that overwhelming majority of the homeless population in SF did not grow up in SF, but then again, you could say the same for the non-homeless residents.<p>I do see this as a national scale problem.

10271961,comment,10271149,10271853,0,0,pron,,,"> I think Haskell&#x27;s type system satisfies your list of requirements.<p>:) Haskell doesn&#x27;t even come close. Haskell&#x27;s type system is pretty much defined to be any property that happens to be inferrable by the (extended) HM algorithm. It&#x27;s like: &quot;we&#x27;ll prove what we easily can&quot; rather than &quot;let&#x27;s prove what&#x27;s most useful&quot;. Sure, it may be useful in some (or perhaps many) circumstances, but it&#x27;s far from the set of properties I think <i>anyone</i> would list when asked &quot;what properties would you most like to verify about your program?&quot;<p>For example, the two most basic tests for any formal verification system is verifying a sorting algorithm (like, say, QuickSort) and verifying a distributed algorithm (like, say, Paxos). Haskell&#x27;s type-system fails to do both. Again: it cannot verify the two most common examples that people want automatic verification for. In fact, it is even too weak to verify that the monads it so depends on are actually monads. Still, it places a non-negligible burden on the developer that many would deem substantial or even onerous. And because types place <i>some</i> burden on the developer, you can then ask whether the set of verifiable properties is worth it or not (BTW, that any form of formal verification requires effort is pretty much a given; if it didn&#x27;t, that would be a violation of the halting theorem).<p>OTOH, richer type systems (that include dependent types) can no longer infer everything, and they become (much) harder-yet to use.<p>Here are some examples of properties of interest:<p>1. When a request arrives at my server, a response (either a result or an error), is always produced within a given time frame. There can never be deadlocks, livelocks or starvation.<p>2. X and Y are two columns in my data table that must always satisfy certain invariants, and must never be observed to violate those variants.<p>3. My O(n) selection algorithm is correct.<p>4. My (sorting) algorithm requires O(1) space.<p>5. When a user inputs &quot;X&quot; the system will (or will-never) output &quot;Y&quot; within 5 seconds.<p>There are many, many more. I picked those because there are formal verification tools today that can verify all those properties (or at least many interesting instances of them). Of course, some proofs would require your computational model to be non-Turing complete, because the halting problem is real...",1443106664

For an arbitrary and hypothetical example, imagine that Linus woke up yesterday and decided to convert the Linux kernel to an Apache licensed project. The long and almost impossible task would be to contact each and every contributor to the Linux kernel and ask for the permission to change the license of their contribution. The &quot;short&quot; and &quot;easy&quot; task would be to write a new kernel and replace all of Linux with it, applying the new license. The old Linux kernel would still be a GPL project, but moving forward any contributions would need to be Apache licensed.<p>It appears that the latter example is somewhat like what happened here. The old Oh-My-Fish project was some licensed project. It could have even been a WTF Public License[0] that _did_ allow contributors to fork and remove attribution. At some point, all the code in the repo was replaced with new code under the MIT license that served the same purpose, and the repo&#x27;s name was changed. Moving forward, someone continued to merge in the new code to the old repo and tried to remove attribution to the new code, breaking the new code&#x27;s license.<p>The Oh-My-Fish project could have done a classical fork, severing ties with the Wahoo project just before the merge of the re-written code happened and continue to work in isolation, but it seems that they did not.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.wtfpl.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wtfpl.net</a>",1443106600

These researchers, for example, believe they have found EEG test results that correlate with loneliness. It would seem to me that loneliness could change both self-generated behavior and response to stimuli, which could yield reliable measures. Sociality is a biologically mediated phenomenon, so there could be metabolic measures, like how cortisol is an indicator of stress.

Only in the 20th century for something that might seem to an outsider to be fundamental to mathematics (after all, mathematicians sometimes compute, right?)<p>> So why avoid this kind of stuff? Because you want to pick a &quot;cognitive abstraction&quot;, in your terms, which is most useful.<p>Oh, absolutely, but there are many ways and many forms of reconciling &quot;equational&quot; mathematics and computational mathematics, and PFP is just one of them. As I&#x27;ve shown in another comment, Prolog takes this much further than Haskell because it&#x27;s truly equational (or, rather, relational), while Haskell gladly allows a direct (one-way) computation if it defines it as pure, i.e. in Haskell 2+2=>4 is still as different from 4=>2+2 as it is in Java. Other ways are the plain procedural style (which simply lets you name and parameterize a computation), and my favorite (although I don&#x27;t know how practical), temporal logic used in, e.g. Esterel (and TLA+).<p>My beef is not with equational reasoning as a concept, and not even with Haskell&#x27;s flavor of it. Certainly &quot;equationality&quot; in programming languages is a spectrum (as computation is inherently non-equational), and finding useful points on it is a matter for lots of empirical study. My &quot;beef&quot; (if that&#x27;s what you want to call it) is with the claim that Haskell&#x27;s particular design is somehow more fundamental or mathematical than other designs, and, to bring us back to the topic of the discussion, that (cognitive) monads are somehow essential. The reality is that there are many (good) justifications for Haskell&#x27;s design, but they&#x27;ve been made by people to match certain human aesthetics and certain human goals[1] and they don&#x27;t have any transcendent mathematical justification. They are just a point in the design space. Similarly, monads are only (pretty much) essential in Haskell given its design. Some people try to present Haskell (and monads) as the language (and abstraction) God, nay, better -- <i>Math</i> -- has given us, and that&#x27;s just wrong. It&#x27;s just a language like many others, with its own design choices. Besides, everybody knows God uses Lisp. My other &quot;beef&quot; is with the unjustified belief that a certain way of expressing an algorithm is automatically cognitively optimal just by virtue of it being equational (be it either in the Haskell or the Prolog sense).<p>[1]: One of them is a particular balance between correctness and specification effort, which, again, is also arbitrary and defined by the limitations of HM type inference.<p>P.S.<p>To clarify something I wrote in another comment, Haskell&#x27;s definition of purity, while fundamentally arbitrary (from a computational theory point-of-view), makes a lot of sense if you&#x27;ve chosen that particular design.",1443105026

I tried as a bachelor, but I just couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make a tasty meal without a big hunk of meat.<p>When I met my wife, who is vegan, it suddenly became easy to lower my animal product consumption. This was because I had a good example to follow.<p>It&#x27;s a very strange challenge, because meat is so damn tasty.",1443103513

I&#x27;m sure there is a key point for most shows that most who watch up to that point end up watching the whole thing. BSG I remember took 10-12 episodes before I really got into it, and I only went that far because people wouldn&#x27;t shut up about how good it was. There are also shows I really liked but either dragged on or I just lost interest in or was just frustrated by the characters (The Killing, Buffy, etc)",1443103497

Significant gains are certainly easier with significant moral compromise, and while it could be argued that he wasn&#x27;t &#x27;in the know&#x27; (I haven&#x27;t been following the story close enough to be familiar with his purview over these things) if he wants to resign as some sort of reconciliatory measure, in my mind that means actually RECONCILING for the incident and not making out like a robber bandit.",1443103472

As one of an endless number of examples, a well respected, major recipe site has a mechanism to change the servings, and first you have to click on a &quot;servings&quot; button, and then on the actual serving count. After clicking on the servings, several hundred milliseconds later an ad appears exactly where the count input is, and clearly considerable engineering effort went into designing this, and many other, accidental interactions.<p>For what? I can only speak for myself but my immediate reaction is to click back and feel annoyed, and consider ad blocker options. It has never led to engagement or a purchase. Ever. The end result is that the performance of ads simply collapses, and sites have to get even trickier to entice accidental clicks. Rinse and repeat.<p>If you work in the &quot;trick click&quot; space, you are just dooming yourself. It is a race to the bottom.",1443103333

7164052,comment,7163363,7163917,6,0,NickNameNick,,,"Desktops with touch are stupid.\nMy monitor is up in front of my face, and a good distance back on my desk, not down on the front of my desk where my hands are.\nI&#x27;m not sitting at my computer to give my shoulders a workout. Besides which, any idiot who gets fingerprints all over my nice monitor deserves a slapping, even if its me.<p>Having touch sized buttons on the screen makes the mouse and keyboard experience worse - everything has to be bigger, with giant borders and separation because your finger is ~100px or more across, and my mouse pointer has a single-pixel click area.<p>Te problem with the hybrid approach is simply that I, or any anyone like me, can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t use touch for our desktop use, so why should a touch oriented UI forcibly impinge upon our experience?\nThey didn&#x27;t keep the desktop as it was - they removed the start button and a bunch of context menus and hid them in those ridiculous &#x27;charms&#x27; pop-outs. The start screen is an enormous waste of time. If they were optional, or the defaults changed based on whether a touch screen was present it might be different, but they are not optional, or even configurable without third party software.<p>I&#x27;m not saying they can&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t change things. I think the start menu could have been re-drawn as something visually like a charm menu, fading in from the left edge of the screen, so long as it doesn&#x27;t take you away from what you are doing it would have been fine.",1391299120

I don&#x27;t have a need for another file manager any more than I needed another init system, but if this was being done by anybody besides Canonical, the comments would say ~&quot;So stoked to see a new option disrupting the file manager space&quot;.<p>They&#x27;re betting they can provide a better UX with their own tool. If they fail, or can&#x27;t maintain it, or whatever, then that&#x27;s on them, and people will shift onto other distros.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what they do better, in the hopes that other projects can benefit as well.",1391299082

For a single logical concept (e.g. sound, ditto for display), a plethora of layers are involved and they all clash heavily, both in term of settings and abstractions.",1391298990

At least in my usage, it functions exactly like the old start menu did: I either start typing to find a program (most of the time) or I hit all programs and look around for it. What slows you down?<p>The main things I dislike about 8/8.1 are hot corners and the Metro apps being default on desktops. (Seriously Microsoft, I&#x27;m glad you finally implemented a native PDF reader but come on.) I don&#x27;t understand complaints about the start screen.<p>That being said, Windows 8 did one really great thing for the desktop: multi-monitor support finally works the way it should have all along.

For example, a Surface by itself would show the metro UI, but connect a type cover or a keyboard and mouse and it&#x27;d flip to the desktop interface.

The plan was for me to graduate with a bachelor&#x27;s in structural engineering and then we could work together to grow the business further. At 20, I earned my bachelor&#x27;s in structural engineering. Unfortunately my father had died in an accident at work when I was in my penultimate year of engineering. I managed to get enough resources together to be able to attend grad school in the US. I met my wife there. BTW, she has an amazing story too. We now have a startup (<a href=""https://magtag.me"" rel=""nofollow"">https://magtag.me</a>) that received angel investment recently.

That&#x27;s what I meant by “anything not fully developed”: details of active operations commonly need those.<p>The funniest case I had was a company that had scraped the (public) web, asked me to do some statistical studies on the table, and had me sign an NDA saying that I should not reveal to third parties what they had told me, i.e. nothing but the database of public information, and completely transparent mandate (a shoe company wanted to understand what people said about shoes on-line — except it wasn&#x27;t shoes). What I was supposed to send them (original results) was also covered by the NDA (the agreement was written as to cover both parties either way), preventing <i>them</i> from forwarding my report to anyone; they worked for a third party, not mentioned on that contract. They <i>de facto</i> signed themselves into a huge legal risk if I were feeling cheeky. Even funnier thing: I was one of several possible contractors, but the contact covered “all communications” in “any way”, meaning that even if I wasn&#x27;t selected, I could send them the report anyway, and they would then possibly not be allowed to send any elements that I had included in my report, even if the other contractor had found that insight too.

The entropy estimates in the comic, if you prefer to think of it this way, assume a &quot;wordlist attack&quot; (they actually assume the most efficient attack possible, though in this case I guess you could say that&#x27;s a &quot;wordlist attack&quot;). It&#x27;s also assumed that the words are chosen randomly (from the comic: &quot;four random common words&quot;), not &quot;off the top of my head,&quot; so no, human fallibility is not an issue with the scheme itself, so much as the way many people interpret the word &quot;random,&quot; when in respect to entropy, it has a very specific meaning. It&#x27;s therefore an undeniable fact that attacking those passwords would require trying an average of half the possible combinations, or 2^(entropy-1). These passwords are <i>just as strong as fully random character strings</i>, so long as you ascribe the correct entropy values.<p>If it helps, don&#x27;t think of the words as words, but instead as random numbers.

7163986,comment,7163751,7163751,2,0,jeffmould,,,"First, congratulations on making it this far, it sounds like you have done a lot of research and have a good idea.<p>For the investor portion, I am not an investor so I can&#x27;t say exactly what they are looking for in your category. From a personal perspective though I would greatly narrow down the pitch. In stead of focusing on the exact question asked by your competitors and you, I would focus more on how your questions are more focused and more informative to the student. You don&#x27;t need to include the specific questions in the pitch. Show them in the demo, but don&#x27;t go over them specifically in the pitch.<p>Moving on the roadmap section, I would eliminate paying students to write reviews. While this works great initially and will get some base data for you, it absolutely does not scale well. If I were an investor this would be a potential flag to me. In addition, if I am paid to do a survey I tend to immediately have a favorable bias towards the results of that survey. An alternative may be to work with potential advertisers within the communities of each school. Say for example get a pizza shop to advertise 10% on the site if the student fills out the survey. You could probably also get the pizza shop to pay for advertising thus generating a source of revenue.<p>Although this angle is a little harder, try working with alumni associations of various schools. Many of them have mailers and such and advertising to alumni could be a great way to get data.<p>This brings up another point. I did not read all the questions on your survey so I could be off a little here. But in skimming the pitch and questions to me it came across as a rating system for which school has the better social life. While potentially great for prospective students, I don&#x27;t think parents, or the schools for that matter, want students choosing them based entirely on social life outside of class. In particular I noticed questions regarding the physical aspects of male/female students. I would tend to stay away from them in the pitch. Not saying you have to remove them from the application, just don&#x27;t highlight them when pitching or selling the app.<p>Hope that helps and good luck.",1391298139

Instead, any exposure increases your <i>lifetime risk</i> of cancer. It is therefore not useful to talk about how medical imaging causes an individual case of cancer.<p>But for a larger population we can figure out what the cancer risk without medical radiation exposure would be, and what the observed probability is. We can then ascribe the difference to these medical tests. Obviously there are a number of ways to fuck up this analysis. Geological differences in the natural radiation dose shouldn&#x27;t be underestimated. However, almost half of the lifetime radiation dose of a human does come from medical applications, and it would certainly be good to reduce that.",1391297383

Until then even though both Quarks 4 and 5 had been released no one I knew, including printers, had gone further than Quark 3.1.<p>The entire creative suite cost less than Quark and Photoshop was essential anyway. No contest. Plus it had support for OS X, could do transparency (no more creating drop shadows in Photoshop and importing them as a flat TIFF, the joy!), had really good typography support (no more creating a separate text box for bullets and manually aligning them), and getting a press-ready PDF out of it wasn&#x27;t some sort of voodoo.<p>The difference 10 years makes. Now Adobe software is slow, bloated and buggy with only minor reasons to upgrade version to version. It seems like the fit and finish is worse on each release and watching photoshop or illustrator creak into life, even on my SSD macbook, is a painful experience.<p>I think the only reason I&#x27;ve upgraded recently is due to their policy of making newer version file formats incompatible with the older version, so I&#x27;ve had to if I want to open files from colleagues. Creative Cloud is a blatant attempt to extract as much rent as they can before the gig is up, not as a way to provide a useful service. For that reason I won&#x27;t be upgrading from CS6, even though as a designer it&#x27;s the software I use most.<p>We need an Adobe competitor who&#x27;ll either remind them they can write good software when they have to or consign them to irrelevance.",1391297298

Put simply, the person who owns the CT machine makes much more than the doctor who interprets the results. And so we have had a blossoming of imaging centers, and CT machines have moved into outpatient cardiology and even family care practices.<p>One of the major goals of Obamacare is addressing these misaligned incentives and shifting to a model where providers are paid to keep people healthy (outcome driven) rather than on volume (fee for service).<p>Another issue has been the difficulty of sharing/accessing existing imaging data, so tests are just repeated to save time (rather that save cost or adequately balance safety).

3593526,comment,3593134,3593134,14,0,neilk,,,"While he is wrong that Wikipedia is a failure, I wouldn't dismiss this guy's rant out of hand. The editor trends he cites are real. But more importantly, experiences like his are becoming more and more common.<p>If you think of the product that Wikipedia delivers as being editor satisfaction, it's currently succeeding more in spite of itself than because of its virtues. Part of the impetus behind the GUI editor project is to indirectly broaden the editor base.<p>I think a more direct solution may be a kind of karma system, perhaps modelled on Slashdot ""meta moderation"". Most Wikipedians, even the ones that really piss other people off, are usually acting in good faith. If you investigate these disputes, invariably the complainer actually did do it a little bit wrong, or at least there is a legitimate difference of opinion. But the problem is, Wikipedians start a conversation with you by reverting everything you just did. At best you are told to go read a few hundred pages of policies to understand why you were wrong. It would be nice if we had some system whereby the greater community could gently nudge these revert-happy editors, and remind them there are more constructive ways to engage. Just as new Hacker News contributors get downvoted to oblivion when they post memes or GIFs.<p>I know for a fact that some people at the WMF are interested in a karma system. It's not easy for 5 or 6 people to stay on top of what 10-100,000 people are doing. One concern is that the WMF may be paying too much attention to soul-sucking trolls who rant on Foundation-L, and not enough to awesome people who are quietly doing great work. I don't work at the WMF any more, but maybe some hack day I'll do this....",1329292726

If you look at the keyboard for the Apple II, it had a ctrl key, and I believe it was used for control characters. On later keyboards, they introduced the open apple key (ancestor of command) while retaining the ctrl key. Apple manufactured their own keyboards, so it was relatively easy for them to have separate keys for control characters and keyboard shortcuts. Microsoft on the other hand, did not have this luxury. They were inclined to base their software around existing keyboards, and so they co-opted the ctrl key for shortcuts.<p>One cool thing I learned while researching this is that Emacs-style keybindings work in TextEdit or any native OS X text area.<p>^A go to beginning of line

This may well be true, but my own suspicion is that it had as much to do with Apple having hundreds of core system developers already familiar with the C++ APIs, and a limited timeframe to get Mac OS X released. Either way, both assertions point to Carbon being a compromise choice.<p><pre><code>  UFS was blown away and replaced with HFS+

In order to maintain compatibility. And it wasn't just ported code -- HFS+ support was rewritten from the ground up as a UNIX file system.

Proof is that no CS people are talking about Traceur are they? It's essentially adding most of the things of CS (before CS) but with JS syntax. So, as i said, if you want to write CS because you think it looks pretty, well, that's fine, but don't defend CS based on it's functionality.<p>And, JavaScript is different then the languages you listed as those are classical languages. You can't even compare them. JavaScript is NOT a classical language. This is a very, very core concept of JavaScript. Why not read Crockford's post I linked to? The performance hit alone should scare you to not use faux JS classes ever.<p>The languages you listed are compiled languages. CoffeeScript is a transpiled language. Also the fact that it's transpiled is why people say ""Oh, dude, it's just JS!"" and so they send JS people pull and bug requests with CS code and we all laugh. You'd <i>never</i> see this in any other languages. I feel like CS developers are blind to this. Do you see Obj-C programmers claiming they program in LLVM or something or send bug requests written in raw LLVM code? No.<p>CoffeeScript, as I said, is fine as it's own language, but the fact of the matter is that it's <i>not</i> and CS developers assume every other JS engineer likes looking at -> instead of function and all other JS engineers like using classes instead of prototypes or that we can't figure out wtf ""this"" is. We can. If we want added functionality we write it in JS as helper functions. What speed are you gaining from using CS instead of Traceur or Dart? It all boils down to one thing:<p>CoffeeScript developers like CoffeeScript merely because they don't like the look of JavaScript otherwise they'd use something like Traceur.",1329290903

Some outliers can therefore be dismissed easily. On the other hand, people will more seriously consider ideas they might otherwise have dismissed as 'silly' right after they were uttered.

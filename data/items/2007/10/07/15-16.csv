Except for some niches where the flow of data is the <i>primary</i> thing you want to express, visual languages are too cumbersome.

You just gotta experience it yourself.  There's nothing like putting something together and seeing it work the first time.  Even if it isn't perfect, that first output is better than sex.  Still makes make holler and jump out of my chair!  (The output, not the sex.)<p>I would strongly suggest trying out any of the many ""Build an App is x Days or Hours"".  Grab a book or something on-line.  They're everywhere.  There was even a pretty good ""Build You Own Ruby on Rails Web App"" on the forum a few days ago (probably 2nd or 3rd page by now).  Follow the instructions and do what they say.  Build you app.<p>One of two things will happen:  you'll either feel like I do and you'll be hooked.  Or not.  Either way is OK, but to not give it a shot in 2007 would be a shame.<p>(By the way, you'll probably find out that's how the best of us got started.  School is cool, but nothing replaces just doing it.)<p>\n",1191770634

Before making a claim that it says nothing about the cause of growth, we should consult the source [PDF]: <a href=""http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEEI/Home/20666132/WealthofNationsconferenceFINAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEEI/Home/20666132/Weal...</a><p>While I agree that tying this intangible wealth to specific factors such as ""hubs"", ""culture"", or ""language"" in a quantifiable manner may be largely guess work, I think it is difficult to argue that on a whole the sum of these factors don't contribute to total wealth.

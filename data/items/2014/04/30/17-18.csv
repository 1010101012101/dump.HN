No other functionality ever gets used because no one knows what it does/implies<p>Thus a simplistic microwave design would consist of a &#x27;+30s&#x27; button and a &#x27;Start/Stop&#x27; button.

We don&#x27;t like sharing our information with it, because we don&#x27;t trust Linked In.<p>That is the reason many of us avoid using Linked In, rather than an objection to social networks in general.

The cost of meeting those regulatory prerequisites is measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars in the USA alone -- more if you want to get a product license everywhere worldwide. So you need to earn back several hundred million bucks in profit in a single-digit period of years ...<p>But antibiotics are unprofitable.

We haven&#x27;t even had a large-scale war in the time that most of us have been alive. But on evolutionary timescales, we&#x27;ve really lived this way for only the blink of an eye.

(Thank you for saying &quot;correct me if I&#x27;m wrong,&quot; indicating that you desire to learn something here on Hacker News.) In general, an employer has somewhat of a DUTY to hire carefully, especially if the people the employer hires will have access to personal information of other persons, or to dangerous instrumentalities, or could otherwise cause criminal or civil harm on the job. Employers who are well advised about the law of &quot;negligent hiring and supervision&quot; and the legal exposure that companies can have from a careless or evil employee take care to check references, to ask the references for back references, and to include a job applicant authorization for an appropriate background check (usually contingent on a firm job offer, but also as a condition for continued employment) as part of the hiring process. Employers are allowed to find out, and are EXPECTED to find out, reliable information about the public workplace behavior of the people they hire.<p>Thinking that the job applicant can control the information flow in the entire process by how the applicant fills out a resume or an application form is one of the biggest misconceptions nonlawyers here on Hacker News have about employment law (again, at least in the United States, the jurisdiction I know best). To the best of my knowledge, there has never been, and could never be, a successful lawsuit by a rejected job applicant if an employer checked back references (for example) and found out something about the applicant&#x27;s previous PUBLIC, WORKPLACE behavior that suggests that the applicant would be a bad fit for the new job.",1398879180

They have their own vocabulary and grammar.  So right away, let that take the pressure off in terms of how quickly you are picking it up. Some people can pick up foreign languages easily. Others can pick up programming languages just as fast. But even if you don&#x27;t have a natural knack for it, with some persistence practice and time, you will get there.<p>Also, remember that the person you are talking to in your new language (the computer) is the biggest grammar nazi you have ever met. And they will refuse to acknowledge you unless you use the proper form exactly right.  So you can&#x27;t get away with just memorizing &quot;Could you please tell me where is the bathroom?&quot; because one day you&#x27;ll accidentally say &quot;Could please tell me bathroom&quot;, and your previously helpful foreign friend will completely blow you off.\nWhat that means is I think it will be easier if you try to really understand every part of the line you are writing:  What is a function.

I&#x27;m sure he can jump in and summarize it better than I can, but in brief: his company has several pipelines which generate quality candidates for the type of work his company performs (he is a co-founder of an application security consulting firm; the pipelines are a series of crypto challenges that are designed to teach you how to implement and how to break common crypto algorithms, and www.microcorruption.com, a ctf that teaches you to reverse-engineer assembly code and craft malicious payloads to take advantage of legitimate exploitable code, while defeating legitimate exploit defenses). These pipelines are, according to tptacek[1], very good at producing candidates who are interested in security work and are capable of doing same, regardless of prior experience. He has also refined his interview process in an effort to generate quantifiable and comparable information about each candidate, as opposed to e.g. asking candidates to solve brain teasers because it makes the interviewer feel smart.<p>[1]: I&#x27;m phrasing it in this way not because I don&#x27;t agree with him, but because it&#x27;s new enough that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been established as objective truth.

Most importantly, he was one of the earliest practitioners of what we would now call the scientific method, and the one of the first to try and actually link his theories with actual observations.<p>On top of this, he also attempted to link ancient greek philosophical traditions, which posited an unending constant universe, with (then) contemporary christian ones, which believed in a fixed moment of creation. This led to him being one of the earliest people to put forward the idea of an expanding universe, and propose a scientific explanation to the start to the universe.<p>Finally, Durham university is one of the best in europe for studying astronomy, and Professor Tom McLeish and the department he&#x27;s in one of the best.

7674771,comment,7674040,7674040,5,0,EGreg,,,"If the public school system wasn&#x27;t a daycare center for parents who need to work but actually focused on educating our kids better, it would have the following structure:<p>1) Give every family a parental-control iPad if they don&#x27;t have a computer at home.<p>2) Deliver the lecture part of each class via an engaging multimedia presentation bought from a marketplace of these things. Instead of a boring teacher or one teacher teaching 20 students, a great presentation would be repeatable by thousands and millions of students, and every year can be improved. It could also be critiqued and fact-checked by reviewers in the market. The market would update them like textbooks.<p>3) The next day, the school day would start later, so kids could get a good sleep (health and cognitive reasons) and a good breakfast (nutrition reasons), the latter can be delivered in school, for kids to come on time and socialize.<p>4) After breakfast and homeroom, the Tests would begin. Every day, the tests would be testing for real knolwedge that would be obtained from the previous day&#x27;s presentations. They would test two levels: minimum adequate comprehension, and solid comprehension. This would replace homework and the method of solution could also be analyzed.<p>5) Students who did not score high enough to demonstrate minimum comprehension for that day would be quickly identified by their test scores. They would be scheduled for smaller REMEDIAL classes later that day for that subject. That means the main time they spend with a teacher would be more individualized and tailored to where they are struggling as actually determined by their attempts on the tests.<p>6) For a student who scores well on all or most tests, the day would be quite pleasant and free of remedial classes. They could do any number of things - and if they have to remain in the school, fine - there will be plenty of entertainment and socializing there. That is their reward for learning and comprehending the previous day, proportional to how many subjects they were able to do.<p>7) Right after the Tests, all students would still have to take classes which aren&#x27;t only comprehension focused such as Gym and Debate etc. But there are very few of those.<p>8) The students would themselves choose how to schedule their time to study for the next day. It could be a study session with friends or a private study session. No one would force them to sit through a lecture.<p>Benefits:<p>1) Insane amounts of homework from multiple classes are replaced by Tests which are already scored in terms of difficulty, cognitive load, and how much time they take. So the school is fully aware of how much load they are putting on the students. Currently there is homework creep.<p>2) Instead of struggling privately and spending money on private tutors many low-income families can&#x27;t afford, the students would get individual attention after their performance was analyzed in a Test setting. Home would be reserved for a lot more passive learning, mimicking the real world.<p>3) The kids would have freedom and responsibility to set aside their own time to learn, and incentive to learn that they do not have when told to sit down and shut up for 5 hours a day. It would also lower incidents of diagnosis of ADHD, especially in restless younger boys in grades where psychological development and aptitude feedback is crucial to get right.<p>4) Lectures are boring and too variable in quality. An uncommonly great teacher may only be able to reach 20 students while the rest get mediocre or bad lectures. There is no reason to keep things this way when technology can replace lectures with professionally produced multimedia at home. Animations and stories teaching algebra and calculus for example.<p>5) If you go to the bathroom or zone out during a lecture, you are faced with big dilemmas, having to copy notes from classmates. Here you just rewind. A kid can even pause the lecture for 2 hours and go play basketball or watch another one, finishing this one when they want. Truancy would be greatly reduced.<p>6) Note taking would not be compulsory and you wouldn&#x27;t be training kids to be 2nd century Roman scribes. Instead you&#x27;d be ingraining habits about learning online which they will carry for the rest of their life. For 99% of us all the material is already written clearly online. Note taking should be optional.<p>7) It would actually be cool among kids to be educated because these kids would get access to programs the remedial kids didn&#x27;t. So we would foster a desire and self motivation in kids to learn. Both teachers and kids would be motivated in their remedial classes to prepare kids for comprehending lectures of the next day. Going to a remedial class means that the next day&#x27;s tests are likely to be guaranteed pass. If these remedial classes get the kid to eventually start consistently scoring above Adequate, into Solid Mastery, both the kid and the teacher are rewarded.<p>8) Which brings me to granularity, measurability and accountability. The interaction of teachers and students would be in a smaller classroom setting, and more effective. Struggling would be caught early. Each subject would be broken down into very granular modules (one a day). A kid falling behind would be seen a mile away.<p>This is an example of actually refactoring the system to take advantage of existing technology and aligning the incentives and delivery mechanisms of the system with what what technology has made possible. It has been possible for 15 years now via internt and 40 years via VHS. It&#x27;s about time this has been tried.<p>But the question is more about bureaucracy. Given the way public schools are run today, would a principal and teachers ever be willing to try something new? It may be impossible to reform the system so drastically. And what would we do with all those kids and their free time? Wouldn&#x27;t this lead to more bullying and abuse as maturing 11 year old kids are stuck in a daycare center?<p>I believe the only avenue for trying this system are private and charter schools.

7674739,comment,7671827,7671827,5,0,Simucal,,,"Thiago claims that one of Vim&#x27;s biggest problems is its lack of testing infrastructure.  It is difficult to refactor or make changes without the chance of introducing some possibly obscure regression.  This is probably a big part of Bram&#x27;s reluctance to merge large changesets from other developers.<p>I honestly thing if he can successfully pull off this &quot;msgpack UI&quot; and get a solid set of tests written (which the community seems eager to start work on) this project will be a huge success.<p>Here is his quote from the mailing list:<p>&quot;This may not be so obvious, but vim&#x27;s biggest problem has nothing to do with the lack of the above features. It&#x27;s something much more basic: poor testing infrastructure.<p>While vim has some automated tests(about 200 counting with the ~100 tests embedded in test 49) those only catch the &#x27;biggest&#x27; bugs, with many small ones being introduced by patches and only detected at a later time. It&#x27;s a true maintenance hell, and here&#x27;s a post on reddit that illustrates the problem(even though the author himself disagrees with neovim): <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1yjzez/neovim_a_project_to_refactor_and_modernize_the/cfla7j5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1yjzez/neovim_a...</a><p>The problem is that in it&#x27;s current state, vim cannot grow because there&#x27;s no easy way to write automated tests for it. The current test suite is very hard to understand and those that submit patches probably won&#x27;t write tests because it&#x27;s too complicated. But patches need to be tested, especially bug fixes which must acompany a regression to ensure they won&#x27;t be reintroduced. So it&#x27;s easy to see why Bram is skeptical about merging patches, especially new features: He has no way of knowing if those patches will break existing code. In the example given by the reddit comment, Bram &#x27;solved&#x27; the problem by simply picking the lesser of two evils.<p>This is one of the firsts issues neovim aims to fix: By writing a msgpack &#x27;UI&#x27;, we&#x27;ll be able to write well-documented functional tests in a high-level language. Contributors reporting bugs will be able to reproduce them with a test cases and new features will be properly tested. As the test suite covers more code, neovim will be more &#x27;protected&#x27; since there will be a bigger chance of catching bugs the minute a PR is sent(with travis). People need to understand that before posting issues regarding new features or new ideas, as neovim must be properly &#x27;secured&#x27; against bugs first.&quot;",1398878418

The Smalltalk client application has 385 windows and over 5,000 classes. About 2,000 classes in this application interacted with an early (circa 1993) data access framework. The framework dynamically performed a mapping of object attributes to data table columns.<p>Analysis showed that although dynamic look up consumed 40% of the client execution time, it was unnecessary.<p>A new data layer interface was developed that required the business class to provide the object attribute to column mapping in an explicitly coded method. Testing showed that this interface was orders of magnitude faster. The issue was how to change the 2,100 business class users of the data layer.<p>A large application under development cannot freeze code while a transformation of an interface is constructed and tested. We had to construct and test the transformations in a parallel branch of the code repository from the main development stream. When the transformation was fully tested, then it was applied to the main code stream in a single operation.<p>Less than 35 bugs were found in the 17,100 changes. All of the bugs were quickly resolved in a three-week period.<p>If the changes were done manually we estimate that it would have taken 8,500 hours, compared with 235 hours to develop the transformation rules.<p>The task was completed in 3% of the expected time by using Rewrite Rules.

It exists for you to project the optimal image of yourself in a professional context. It is useful because it has a consistent format that makes it much more easily readable than a collection of custom sites.<p>Having a LinkedIn page isn&#x27;t mutually exclusive with creating your own page / blog / whatever.

Nobody gets jobs that way; you usually have to know someone who works there already. LinkedIn helps answer the &quot;who do you know here again?&quot; question because the interviewer who looks at your profile 5 minutes before you walk into his office will already know that you used to work at some startup with his head of development.

Public recommendations are good (the skills endorsements list much less so).<p>If you don&#x27;t have a LinkedIn profile, I assume you&#x27;re either very junior, shady, or clueless, and none of those is good. [Edit: per comments below, you might have some deep principled reason for not using social networks. In this case my metric is wrong, but I&#x27;m okay with having a false negative once in a while.]<p>Expecting everyone to have and maintain their own domain probably isn&#x27;t practical, but even for those that do, the discoverability of that domain is low: I don&#x27;t search google to find developers, I search LinkedIn. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for, and it&#x27;s really pretty good at it.<p>They do some really dumb UI stuff around privacy that is trivially worked around using Incognito. I wish they didn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s not dumb enough to make me abandon the giant utility of the network as a whole.<p>[Update: I took this thread to Twitter and got a bunch of really cogent arguments, including that LinkedIn enables harrassment/stalking of marginalized groups.

Meanwhile, a 15% protein diet needs ~70-80g protein a day/person[4]. The only material protein in this &quot;dinner&quot; salad is 1 egg yolk, and 1 anchovie split by 2x people. That is 3-4g of protein per head, when a typical dinner should have ~30g (off by an order of magnitude).  Twice as much protein actually hides in the cheese garnish. But to increase the protein to reasonable levels,  Its tempting to double or tripple portion the cheese...thus driving up the food cost of the recipe. 4 oz of fresh-grated parmesan is at least $2.50. That would give you 25g protein/head out of the meal, but the cost for the salad would be $8 for 2x portions, blowing the daily budget in just one meal.<p>In any event, this is an increasingly interesting area for cooks and food authors[3].<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-Yields-Purchasing-Professional/dp/111812250X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-Yields-Purchasing-Professiona...</a><p>[1] Assume 2000 kcal/day, 15%=300kcal. 80g protein is 320kcal, 70g is 280.<p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Monroe"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Monroe</a>",1398877791

Some are obvious and some aren&#x27;t.<p>- Hard to test a class in isolation -> too many dependencies<p>- Tests fail intermittently -> mutable global variables<p>- Unable to find a good point to test -> direct access of system externals, i.e., no layering<p>- All tests can&#x27;t run because of resource leaks -> code doesn&#x27;t clean up after itself<p>- Urge to test something private in a class -> usually an SRP violation<p>- ...<p>The list goes on.<p>The real question is why? Why is testability a proxy for good design?<p>I think that the reason it is is because the essence of good design is creating things that are understandable - understandable enough to see plainly what they do and understandable to enough to modify and extend.<p>Automated testing is a cognitive process - it is writing code that understands code. Every step of  test is bit of that cognition. If it&#x27;s hard to write code that &quot;understands&quot; your code, then it&#x27;s probably hard to understand your code.",1398877782

So at $4/day you can afford 8 pounds of uncooked rice.  After cooking it, it&#x27;ll be a whole lot more than 8 pounds due to water adsorption.  But the nutrient content of the uncooked rice (not much washes away) is about 3 cal/gram somewhat pessimistically aka about 1200 calories per pound of uncooked rice.

When the state officials/national highway officials decided to expand the route to 6-lanes plus the RR, they basically leveled a bunch of neighborhoods in Boston and Newton (I assume via eminent domain). The turnpike authority developed a scheme (pushed by a large insurance company/developer in Boston) to lease &quot;air rights&quot; above the pike. That&#x27;s why the Prudential Center in Boston and Star Market were built above the pike in 1963, and a few years later, the hotel in Newton Corner and some buildings attached to the Hancock tower in Boston.<p>The story is here:<p><a href=""http://www.edrgroup.com/pdf/mta-economic-v2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edrgroup.com/pdf/mta-economic-v2.pdf</a>",1398877437

It sounds like your predecessor figured it out. Now it&#x27;s time for you to do so too. Don&#x27;t negotiate a new deal at your current company. Take the new offer and focus your efforts there. It can be scary to leave a role you are comfortable in, but it&#x27;s the step you need to take to grow your career. A $50k/year salary increase is a lot of money. Even after taxes, that alone would cover the mortgage payments on a nice house in many parts of the country.<p>Saying the company is on the verge of growth is common tactic that people like your boss use. It plays into the same psychological effects that cause people to overvalue things that they own. The pain of missing out on something seems greater than the upside of selling, even if you logically know it&#x27;s not true. The truth is that if your boss is cheap and entitled, he will be that way even more so when the company is more successful. Don&#x27;t be surprised if he starts doing things like giving himself a generous salary increase or investing in capital equipment before profits are computed. Also 1% of profits is likely worthless if he cashes out and sells the company (notice he didn&#x27;t offer you true equity). Don&#x27;t let that mirage fool you into getting the paid what you are worth in the market.",1398877432

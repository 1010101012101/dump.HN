Sadly, I don't think Facebook itself can recover from this.<p>Most world-changing information technologies go through a very long life cycle. Somewhere in the middle during mass usage, commercialization takes over and the technology is slowly strangulated by advertising until it's eclipsed by the ""next big thing"". It's slowly happening to radio, TV, newspapers, books, newsgroups, etc.<p>Unfortunately, somehow massive social networks have skipped years of usefulness and have jumped straight to the end where they're 80% advertising and dreck. This is how I feel about Facebook. Every time I use it, it's a chore to mentally filter out all the noise about who likes what or what fucking digital gewgaw someone is trying to ply me with.

This technology wasn't in common use when I went to school, but it seems really easy for the school to slip in something granting them the right to upload this to TurnMeIn into one agreement you sign or another.<p>For that matter, it's not entirely clear to me what the copyright issues are around work you do for your university. I mean you're already handing it over to the Professor with the exception that he'll do some things with it. Can he hand it out to future classes as an example of the kind of thing he's looking for? (This seems common.)  Can he bundle it with other papers and use it as a textbook in future classes? (This seems uncommon.)  I do think it is \ncommon for schools to at least co-own the publishing rights to a Doctoral thesis.

Social ways to deal with incompatibility are superior to the <i>specific</i> technical way that rubygems encourages.<p>> Although it doesn't happen often, an app can break due to reliance on library bugs or unformalized/undocumented behavior/internals. Sometimes a newer version of a library has a regression that isn't found until it's released.<p>> Yes we all know things like these ideally shouldn't happen, but they do. Is it a good idea to ignore the reality that things like this happen from time to time?<p>I'm not ignoring that reality at all. I'm specifically encouraging point releases with backported bug-fixes. These happen all the time in dpkg-land.<p>> According to the logic that supports your point of view, we should abolish protected memory as well.<p>Extrapolation to extremes will destroy any rational argument, so I'll ignore this.<p>> 2. It assumes that DPKG/RPM don't make life hellish for sysadmin and end users.\n> For the most part, DPKG/RPM works fine. For Ruby stuff, not so much.<p>That would be the point.  I'd also point out that it's not just a question of dpkg vs rubygems here. From a sysadmin's point of view, it's dpkg vs (rubygems + CPAN + PEAR + cabal + virtualenv/pip + maven + ...).<p>> Suppose there's an app called frobnicator, and it works on foobar 1.0.x but not on foobar 1.2.x. Thanks to the fact that DPKG/RPM only supports installation of single versions, your distro can only package foobar 1.2.x but not 1.0.x. Now the user cannot use frobnicator at all because you insist on DPKG/RPM.<p>That specific case isn't a problem, because you'd just package foobar 1.0.x and ignore 1.2.x completely. The problem comes when something else comes along that depends on 1.2.x but won't work on 1.0.x at all. That would be a case of either foobar's author not following version numbering convention, or a bug which can/should be patched.<p>> How exactly is this better for the end user?<p>If it's not, foobar's author is responsible.  However, for the distro to be able to turn around and say ""We value stability over all else, and we cannot provide this combination of packages while supporting a stable system, so we're not going to"" is actually fairly awesome.",1285941172

Let's analyze this viewpoint in detail.<p>First a few axioms we must agree on:<p>1. Libraries eventually have to break compatibility, otherwise progress is impossible.<p>2. There must be some way to deal with incompatibilities, either socially (release and compatibility guarantee policies) or technically (package managers).<p>Your point of view: social ways to deal with incompatibility are superior to to technical ways to deal with incompatibility because the latter encourages developers to be lazy about compatibility guarantees.<p>I have a few objections about that point of view.<p>1. It assumes a perfect world.<p>Although it doesn't happen often, an app can break due to reliance on library bugs or unformalized/undocumented behavior/internals. Sometimes a newer version of a library has a regression that isn't found until it's released.<p>Yes we all know things like these ideally shouldn't happen, but they do. Is it a good idea to ignore the reality that things like this happen from time to time?<p>According to the logic that supports your point of view, we should abolish protected memory as well. Protected memory allows programmers to write apps that don't bring down the entire OS when they crash... it makes programmers lazy!!<p>2. It assumes that DPKG/RPM don't make life hellish for sysadmin and end users.<p>For the most part, DPKG/RPM works fine. For Ruby stuff, not so much. Suppose there's an app called frobnicator, and it works on foobar 1.0.x but not on foobar 1.2.x. Thanks to the fact that DPKG/RPM only supports installation of single versions, your distro can only package foobar 1.2.x but not 1.0.x. Now the user cannot use frobnicator at all because you insist on DPKG/RPM. How exactly is this better for the end user?",1285938571

This test, otoh, implies the same information (minus the exact difference in file size), but is pretty easy to set up.<p>2.

One can argue it is evil because its predominant use is to distribute pirated content. But it is not. Similarly, nukes were seriously considered for plugging the oil leak - to name one recent example.<p>If you can't think of any usage of NAT that is not harmful - it does not mean there isn't one. To start, what you mention - the stateful nature of the NATs (one of the reasons why people fight so hard to have them) - is a useful security property and is very frequently sought after by the people who want to put the NATs in IPv6. Check my vid on xtranormal that I mentioned in another message.<p>What <i>is</i> harmful in NATs is that they destroy the end-to-end referrals (and when they remap the numeric ports to different ones, too).<p>Another example of NATs that is useful and is widely used is the load balancer. It is exactly NAT, but put inside-out. Sometimes even doing SSL decapsulation. And you <i>can</i> use round-robin destination NAT as a poor man's loadbalancer technique (how useful it is today, is another story).<p>To summarize: NATs are like recreational drugs. Pleasant in small dozes, lethal when uncontrolled. And people can not control themselves in using them.",1285938271

If you were given one, you can cancel it. If you weren&#x27;t given one, then there&#x27;s practically nothing that could actually overdrawn the account, the only time when that happened to me was when the currency value changed in between me sending the money and the bank processing the transaction, at which time it was too late for the bank to reverse it - so I went like -$2 on my account which wasn&#x27;t supposed to be overdrawn.<p>And $7 to send a money order?

While the numbers are a lot bigger than those discussed in the article, it&#x27;s the same fundamental problem: bad cash flow burnt my credit to the ground, and has cost me untold sums in late fees, interest, high cost of borrowing, tax penalties, bank fees -- the works.<p>No, can&#x27;t plausibly cry poor house in good conscience. Nevertheless, the old NET-30/60/90 day shuffle when one has monthly bills to pay can be quite demoralising, and stops many small-scale entrepreneurial endeavours dead in their tracks. It&#x27;s not poverty, but it&#x27;s still a question of livelihood and, ultimately, survival and purpose.<p>The hard lesson I&#x27;ve learned is: just because one has (e.g.) $100k in gross revenue does not mean one can live a lifestyle and/or run a company as one could on a $100k salary. Effectively, it needs to be discounted to something like $35k to account for lukewarm cash flow, which means making $100k is really like making $35k.",1441698609

What it effectively does is that it gives government more control over the economy. The QE money guarantees the government money that &quot;it has to pay back&quot; but doesn&#x27;t pay interest on. In other words, the government believes (and may be right) that this money never needs to be paid back, and this is what&#x27;s subsidizing government spending at the moment. Effectively a tax on the monetary base instead of on other things like assets (tax the people who only have money to the benefit of those who own houses, stocks, bonds, ... that sort of thing. And this is done without explicitly charging them anything).<p>Currently, every European is paying 120 euros monthly to subsidize banks and stock/bond prices. They are going to keep doing this &quot;for 2 years&quot; (after that, the theory is, governments are going to be offered more free money and say &quot;no thank you, I&#x27;ve had enough&quot;. In other words, fat chance). By that time every European will have paid 3000 euros to push up stock prices, the vast majority does so without owning stock, so it&#x27;s just a cost for them.<p>(The US poor have paid 8333 per-person over the last 4 years to create the current bubble in stocks, house prices, bonds and so on. Currently they&#x27;re not paying anymore. Note that the stock market is doing very badly. Expect the housing market to crash shortly)<p>Now you might think that you haven&#x27;t lost any money, and that&#x27;s true, you&#x27;ve lost value. Those 8333 you paid over the last 4 years mostly went to funds with the purpose of making houses more expensive. Making stocks more expensive, and the like. So you haven&#x27;t lost money ... well no, you haven&#x27;t. You&#x27;ve lost part of the ability to buy houses, stocks, cars, bread, ... But don&#x27;t worry ! The official statistics show no loss of purchasing power (they did take out gasoline, cars, houses, ... you see when those things got expensive, a lot of people stopped buying them. So &quot;it doesn&#x27;t make sense to have them in the consumption index anymore&quot;. Great, and might even be accurate, but let&#x27;s not pretend this remains a useful metric to compare the wealth of the average American to 20 or even 10 years ago).<p>And this is explicit government policy. It&#x27;s not like the ministers and so on don&#x27;t know this. The net effect is to let the government control slightly over 50% of economic activity, which wouldn&#x27;t be sustainable otherwise. So they make sure the extra taxes are well-hidden.",1441698382

Open source is not a popularity contest.  In fact, open source, and specially free and libre software, is a great place for leftfield technologies to flourish.  In fact, Lisp had a place in free software before Github even existed, with various flavours being the scripting language of choice in popular projects like Emacs, Gimp or Gnome.<p>It is rather in the proprietary corporate world where there is often resistance to adopt languages outside of the mainstream.   The more supply of developers for a technology is available, the lower cost of labour.  It&#x27;s hard for the merits of a technology to argue against this fact in the face of management.",1441697269

702462,comment,702304,702304,0,0,callahad,,,"Quick attempt to answer these based on my understanding of the GPL, and just a quick cursory skim of version 3. I am not a lawyer.<p>[Edit: It seems like my answers to the first few are a bit contentious and should really be ""it depends""; see comments below.]<p>1. Yes, by using foo.py as a library, your bar.py must also be GPL'd. This would be different were foo.py under the Lesser GPL.<p>2. Not shipping foo.py does not change the answer to #1; you still depend on it, thus your work still counts as a derivative.<p>3. Not depending on foo.py, but using it if available does not change the answer to #1. Once your code makes use of the GPL'd library, it must also be GPL'd.<p>4. Yes, calling GPL'd libfoo.so via Ruby/DL requires that your code be GPL'd; the full GPL does not have library exceptions like the LGPL.<p>5. Separate distribution does not change the above.<p>6. GPL'd foo.js and proprietary bar.js can be combined into a single foobar.js and retain their respective licenses, so long as they are functionally independent. ""Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate."" (Last line of Section 5 of GPLv3)<p>7. I'm not sure of the specifics of XUL, but I'd imagine depending on a GPL'd .js file and including that in the XUL app would indeed create a derivative work, and require the XUL app to be GPL'd.<p>8. Sharing modified versions between internal teams does not count as conveyance, so long as those teams are within the same business entity. See <a href=""http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html#InternalDistribution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html#InternalD...</a><p>9. Unsure, but I'm learning towards distribution to a fully-owned subsidiary still counting as conveyance to an outside entity, and thus triggering the GPL. If they're different entities to the IRS, they're probably different entities to the FSF.<p>10. Conveyance to a majority-owned subsidiary seems like conveyance to an outside entity, and would thus trigger the GPL.<p>11. Price isn't a factor; the applicability of the GPL is wholly determined by the distribution counting (or not counting) as ""conveyance"" to an outside party.<p>12. As per the FSF's FAQ, conveying the work to a contractor for use off site <i>does</i> trigger the GPL.<p>13. The mechanism matters. If Jane uses the software off-site or is able to make or receive copies, then it would trigger the GPL.<p>14. Giving the modified Foo.exe to consultants does trigger the GPL, as per the FSF FAQ above.<p>15. Using a company-owned terminal with company-modified GPL app does not count as conveyance, and does not trigger the GPL.<p>16. Allowing outside parties to download the modified Foo.exe, even though they are on-site, does trigger the GPL; consider it akin to purchasing software from a brick and mortar point of distribution. Where you received it doesn't matter, it's the fact that you can take it home.<p>17. The Job Applicant is not yet an employee of Initech; if they receive the modified Foo.exe, it's been conveyed to an outside entity, and thus triggers the GPL. The means of conveyance are not important.<p>18. Making the modified Foo.exe freely available on a public web server clearly triggers the GPL's conveyance clause.<p>19. Password protecting the download of Foo.exe does not matter if an outside entity can legitimately receive it; it's still conveyance.<p>20. My shot at a basic principle for laypeople: ""If you can walk away with the application in any form, it is conveyance.""<p>Bonus: Jacob shouldn't have these problems since he's a Django developer; ""Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, if not conveying."" Make the Django site live in a well defined place, and make all the interaction happen in the browser. Congratulations, you've used the software-as-a-service loophole.",1247518526

You can argue over whether it's effective or efficient but it's not anything like the cancer budget. That's like saying that, because of the aid after Katrina, building housing and infrastructure on the Gulf Coast is a <i>policy</i> priority.<p>Yes, there are ways the government could have mitigated or prevented both of these disasters (funding upgrades to the New Orleans levee system, doing a better job at regulating the finance industry, not encouraging homeownership), but you can't compare priorities by comparing emergency spending to ordinary spending.

I would prefer to have someone I trust, is well educated on the subject, and keeps up with the literature who can point me in the right direction.  One result of the specialization in our society and our inability to stay on top of every subject that affects our lives, is that no one can make a truly informed claim on every life decision.<p>Sadly, many health practitioners are less motivated by science and more motivated by process.

702431,comment,702267,702267,0,0,snprbob86,,,"Our team develops a .NET class library. As a game platform, we have the luxury of breaking binary and source compatability between releases because games are atypically short-lived applications. We provide side-by-side frameworks on both Windows and Xbox, so you don't need to upgrade to the latest framework before you release your game. But that won't stop people from doing it and still complaining.<p>When Microsoft releases a new version of a library, some subset of users upgrade instantly. They expect that all of their code to keep working. When we break source compatability (something most teams NEVER do), we do it very carefully. We only break things where there is a clear, large win and the upgrade path is straightforward. Customers have complained when we do this every single time because it is not what they inherently expect.<p>So now back to the original topic at hand: the ""After all, we're all consenting adults here."" mentality. Yeah, that's great and all, but it requires an incredible amount of discipline. See, for example, how the Django project handles this: <<a href=""http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/BackwardsIncompatibleChanges>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/BackwardsIncompatibleChan...</a>. Personally, I love doing things this way. However, consider a large non-software company. They created some internal app and ran into a small bug or shortcoming of a class library. They find out that the new version fixes their problem, so they they upgrade. BAMN. 10 other things break. Ugh, oh. that's not good. They already laid off the dev team that made this program, they have one vendor making a couple quick fixes to handle their new 2010 business rules. This used to work, why are you breaking me? I just want that one new fix!<p>In order to prevent situations like this, you need to carefully monitor your public surface area. This is why the _foo naming convention exists in Python. It lets you say ""We explicitly do not promise not to change this."" Believe me, if you make a type public or a method virtual, some one will instantiate it or override it. I've seen it many times. If you didn't explicitly plan for them to do that, you've still got a backwards compatability bug should you change it. Even if you have it private, someone might call it with reflection and STILL get annoyed when you break them, although this is far more rare.<p>So in summary: this cultural distinction is a meaningful difference in requirements between open source developers and commercial developers. The respective languages have evolved to meet the needs of their respective customers. One is not necessarily better than the other.<p>This is why C# 3 and Python are tied for my favorite language :-)",1247517558

On one side, a number of respected professional scientists conducting a very expensive multi-decade study and publishing the results in peer-reviewed journals.

She claims that in fact the study shows that overweight and obese people are much healthier than the media reported, and they were covering it up.<p>Hm. She takes two major studies to pieces in as many posts.

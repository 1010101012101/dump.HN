Presumably, one of the biggest implications of a paper-based solution is that you get some level of contestability.  In the case of a signature, you get penmanship (at least to a certain degree of expert evaluation); for currency, you get the paper type, watermarking, holograms, etc.<p>You have very little of that in the process described by the OP.  The accountability is ""email is secure, and you know the person's voice.""  That's fine if you implicitly trust your contracting counterpart (heck, then the contract has little purpose).  But it does little if they later recant or refute the signature.  In the end, the most important aspect: It needs to be tested in a court of law before I'd even consider it.<p>I'm not sure what the ""right"" solution is in the digital age, but my hunch is that it will involve some sort of PK Crypto.

The old-style figures are better referred to as text figures and the so-called “usual” ones—which @funkah prefers—as lining or titling figures.<p>The difference between them is not really simply a stylistic choice: text figures are basically lowercase numbers and titling figures are uppercase ones. Saying you don’t like them is like saying you don’t like lowercase letters, and that you prefer everything in uppercase. Using titling figures in running text is like typing in all caps—it’s screaming at you.<p>It’s not so much that the text figures are old and were abandoned, but rather that typewriters simply left them off to simplify things. And since computer keyboards were based on typewriters, they never made their way to computers either. And then they started being used exclusively in newspapers and advertising. If you look at books, though, you’ll see that they never really went away. Only now are we finally getting them back—and that’s the entire point of OpenType and it’s a good thing.<p>Now, the difference between text and titling figures isn’t <i>precisely</i> the same as upper- and lowercase, since titling figures are generally used in titles despite the fact that titles can be mixed case; and they’re also used in tables of numbers. (Although there is another dimension of figure variation—namely, whether they are proportional- or fixed-width—and fixed-width lining figures are typically used in tables so that the places line up.)",1326148131

While pieces of art have always been heavily derivative, it has never been common for artists to forge. The first reason for this being the ethical implications behind it, and the second being the massive amount of effort required to accurately copy a masterpiece. Even those forgeries that have fooled experts for some time pale in comparison to the real thing.<p>Furthermore, whats being discussed now is not analogous to the topic of forgery.  A more apt comparison would be likening the piracy of music to viewing photographs of Vermeer's work. Yet even this isn't a perfect fit, as one can argue ( and quite correctly in my opinion ) that viewing  a photograph of a Vermeer is in no way is the same as seeing it in person. And almost invariably the owners of these paintings charge money for access to them. While these parties are generally not profiting off of these fees money still needs to be paid for access.<p>In the case of audio files, the ease at which one can copy and distribute a perfect replica of the original work certainly does contribute to its ubiquity.

One would want both, but lack of resources forces a 'choice'.<p>Apparently, it typically is better to create new organisms every now and then. That may just be energetically better or it may be because (in particular, sexual) reproduction allows for faster adaptation to changed circumstances",1326146794

Under sufficiently slow and gradual change, it works reasonably well; in the case of a sharp discontinuity, however, the method breaks down: though we may glorify it with the name ""common sense"", our past experience is no longer relevant, the analogies become too shallow, and the metaphors become more misleading than illuminating.<p>There are lots of gems in that essay, such as this:<p>> We can view the program as what turns the general-purpose computer into a special-purpose symbol manipulator, and does so without the need to change a single wire (This was an enormous improvement over machines with problem-dependent wiring panels.) I prefer to describe it the other way round: the program is an abstract symbol manipulator, which can be turned into a concrete one by supplying a computer to it.

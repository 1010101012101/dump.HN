111632,comment,110898,110904,0,0,jraines,,,"This is exactly the kind of philosophical question that pg talked about in ""How to do Philosophy"" that breaks down because of the near impossibility of objectively defining the terms involved, or even coming to a solid consensus on their definition.<p>Obviously, the key term here is ""awareness"".  We ""know"" we are aware because . . . uh, because we think therefore we are, I suppose.  Do our cells know about our awareness beyond their genetic programming to do what they do to contribute to it?  Do we go out of our way to make our cells 'aware' of our super-awareness?<p>My point is that way down the road when there are exponentially more sensors, programs, humans, and other 'resources' connected to the web, how would we even know that it had become . . . something more?  It's probably never, ever going to take over some terminal and say ""Hello there, Dave"".  And we may never know, because just as you can't find consciousness in the brain, you won't be able to find it in the Net.  It would be the ghost in the machine, that had little interest in its component pieces.<p>For those, myself included, who say this or that will 'never' happen, I'd like to add a quote from Freemon Dyson, talking about a multi-disciplinary conference where the future of human evolution was discussed:  ""When the physicists started talking about the <i>really</i> long term, [the others'] eyes glazed over.""",1202431115

It features a set of highly configurable danger thresholds (with sensible defaults provided), verbose alert messages that include the source, destination, scanned port range, begin and end times, tcp flags and corresponding nmap options (Linux 2.4.x kernels only), reverse DNS info, email alerting, and automatic blocking of offending ip addresses via dynamic configuration of ipchains/iptables firewall rulesets. In addition, for the 2.4.x kernels psad incorporates many of the tcp signatures included in Snort to detect highly suspect scans.",1202429607

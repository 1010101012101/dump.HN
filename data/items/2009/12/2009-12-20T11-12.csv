1006036,comment,1005819,1006001,0,0,houseabsolute,,,"But if you look at it another way, a significant portion of what's used in the arc examples would not reach the bar of what's included in the standard libs of some other languages. The fact is that what is in the standard lib of a language is a totally arbitrary decision, and measuring any language's power in a way that's dependent on whether or not a necessary library is in the standard lib is silly.<p>The real test should be, ""How short can you make this code using libraries available for the language which would be generally useful working on some other task as well.""",1261309355
1006033,comment,1005924,1006010,0,0,bdfh42,,,"Interesting question and I suspect difficult to get a sensible answer to. I am assuming that you expect the 20th Century warming period to continue to raise Northern hemisphere temperatures to the levels experienced around 1,000 years ago. Certainly we know that Greenland had a lot less ice then - although we do not know where that water was. I am not sure if we have any information from Northern Canada or Asia. Regretfully I have not heard about any useful data from the South. Was the sea level higher a thousand years ago? Even extrapolating from coastal site evidence might not help as many land masses were still (and are still) rising gently following the last ice age.<p>There is not a lot of evidence that sea levels are rising substantially at the moment - you had best ask an oceanographer - I would stick with the science rather than ask a ""climatologist"".",1261309088

1006013,comment,1005281,1005989,0,0,thirdusername,,,"I think you meant to type the composite word ""varsågod"" (and not ""Be so god"" ^^), it's not a phrase. A similar problem exist with ""lagom"" which roughly means something like: ""enough, not to much or to little."", with a strong positive meaning. It also goes the other way too as computer engineer doesn't have a good exact translation as the English ""engineer"" is more nuanced than the Swedish ""Ingengör"".<p>If you feel like procrastinating and want to have a laugh at how ambiguous and strange Swedish can be I recommend Mastering Swedish by slay radio: <a href=""http://www.slayradio.org/mastering_swedish.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slayradio.org/mastering_swedish.php</a>",1261306963

My daughter, a future engineer, has dropped MIT from her top choice to off the list.  There are many schools that are nearly as good, and despite rankings, better than MIT.<p>Here&#x27;s another cool little anecdote:
I was in a meeting with director from NIST, along with another researcher and our director.  He was in town to give a lecture as part of a regular lecture series we conduct through the school year, and I was meeting with him one-on-one to ask questions about the intersection of IT and power grid operations.  He was relaying a story about some engineering project that they had asked MIT researchers for help on.<p>Suddenly our director burst out laughing.  Said he couldn&#x27;t contain it anymore.  He says, &quot;Yeah, we know about that project.  We&#x27;re the people MIT called when they couldn&#x27;t figure it out.&quot;<p>The moral of the story:  MIT is marketing machine.  As a rule, they are over-ranked in nearly every category, and rely on a historical perspective rather than a current one.",1374202530

(<i>I would add that if you have a good reason for it, that&#x27;s also a reason to re-think companies, and not to simply accept that they can&#x27;t do the right thing because that&#x27;s how they are</i>)<p>I could see a CEO not wanting to see his employees out of a job, or being afraid of his shareholders caring more about the share value than what they see when they look in the mirror; but that doesn&#x27;t automatically justify anything. Especially since even if Google &quot;died&quot;, just for refusing and resisting a little (which I doubt, but I&#x27;m willing to assume it and argue from there anyway), something else would have to replace at least parts of it, and former Googlers would be the first hired for any and all of that.<p>But considering Erich Schmidt says stuff like &quot;<i>If you have something that you dont want anyone to know, maybe you shouldnt be doing it in the first place.</i>&quot;, it kinda seems like the issue sits deeper.

I think it speaks to how much you think the universe makes sense underneath everything, and they see it on a daily basis. Hence, the success and reknown of an Einstein for example: someone who takes the currently-best-known-answers and makes them simpler, more elegant.<p>I think this sort of thinking needs to be applied in many more fields than it is, and it&#x27;s very encouraging to see some people from outside the traditional medicine groups even looking at this supremely important problem.

6068048,comment,6067152,6067591,4,0,fumar,,,"Right now, tablets may be seen as toys. But, who says they can not be used for work. At first cell phones were just for calls and sms. Then some had browsers, they were seen as unnecessary, at the time...<p>My Macbook died a few months back, I tried the Surface RT a few days as a replacement. At first, it was strange, and my work flow suffered. But, alas, after a week, I was back to normal productivity.<p>It has been several months now, of treating the Surface RT as my main machine. I mostly work out of the desktop IE. Sometimes I will snap Netflix or Hulu on the side. I take the device to work, and not need to charge it (awesome). If I need to show the team something, I snap of the keyboard, and pass it around. Microsoft Office is great on the tablet. Since, it is my lady&#x27;s, skydrive is not useful for me. But, it is for her. Her phone uploads everything to skydrive, and she can access the skydrive files, on the Surface. The Surface treats skydrive, like a normal drive. So, if she wants to upload a picture on Facebook (in the browser). She can select any file on the Surface or the skydrive.<p>Most recently, I updated it to the 8.1 Preview. Now that I have outlook, its been even better! The Surface has had constant updates from Microsoft. The first month we had the tablet, it was sluggish and IE, was not ideal. But, it did act as a full fledge browser.<p>This might sound like a glowing review, and it is, but the device is definitely first gen. Besides a few hiccups here and there I am still amazed at how much the RT can handle. At home, I hook it up to a monitor and work of both screens. The type keyboard is great. And, my lady and I will often watch a movie in bed or play some Wordament.<p>Microsoft did a terrible job of communicating what the Surface tablets do.<p>This is coming from a person who grew up using Mac OS. I only used PC&#x27;s in my last few years of high school, then went back to Macs.",1374202466

more <i>old fashioned</i> than he is because
my phone is &quot;dumb&quot; but a <i>wire-line</i>
<i>desk set</i> and not <i>mobile</i>.<p>Why?  Because when I use the phone, I 
want the rest of my relevant <i>stuff</i>
handy -- paper and pen for notes,
various papers, and relevant data on
my computer.<p>But I can&#x27;t make or receive mobile calls?  Right.<p>To receive a call while I am traveling,
my voice phone provider, also my ISP,
has a message recorder, and then I
can get the message via e-mail
and download it.  Really, for most
calls, I would not want to receive a call
while traveling because then
I would not have materials, 
desk, etc. to
be able to handle the
call well.  E.g., maybe I&#x27;m walking
down an isle at a grocery store
looking for a one quart or larger
jar of sweet pickle relish
and get a phone call about something
important where I have no
desk to take notes, note pad,
background info, privacy, etc.  No thanks.<p>For making calls
while traveling, mostly I don&#x27;t
want to do that either.
My work is to write my software, and
I don&#x27;t travel much.  So, when traveling,
I would only call for car emergencies,
and those are too rare to be worth
having a mobile phone, <i>data plan</i>,
keeping batteries charged, etc.<p>And now I&#x27;m concerned about privacy:
As it is, there is no way the NSA
or FBI can track me via my
smartphone signal because I have
no smartphone!  So, the NSA and
FBI can&#x27;t use a smartphone to
track me to my local convenience 
store to buy gas for my car and lawn mower, milk,
French vanilla ice cream, and
wheat bread, to a local pizza 
shop for a pickup for dinner, to Sam&#x27;s Club,
Wal-Mart, and A&P for groceries, 
cat food, etc., to a coin laundry
(until I get my Maytag fixed),
to Chinese carry-out, to 
a hardware store to get epoxy
resin glue to fix loose joints in
wooden furniture, two cycle oil for
my grass trimmer, wet-dry sand paper
to use for sharpening my French chef&#x27;s
kitchen knife -- really top
national security stuff like that!<p>Mostly my information, especially that
relevant to phone calls, 
is on my computer
which is in a mid-tower case on a 
table at home and usually in front of me and, thus, also
not <i>mobile</i>.  E.g., for a phone number,
that&#x27;s on my computer with other
relevant info and easy to find with
some of my software.  And I have a 
little very simple software to
dial phone numbers -- just write
some characters to a COM port
starting with AT and have the
phone wires going into and out
of an old FAX modem (also good
for sending letters via FAX
to my reps in Congress).<p>For a mobile
phone to have my collection of phone numbers, I would
have to copy over the data and, in the
future, <i>sync</i> the two locations of
my data.  Also a <i>smart phone</i>, with
maybe something from Microsoft an
exception, won&#x27;t run my most heavily
used piece of software that, in particular I use for
managing information relevant to
phone calls, my favorite text editor.
If my favorite editor were emacs,
then maybe it would also run on 
a Linux based smartphone.  But, as it is 
a <i>smartphone</i> is a <i>computer</i>
but a pain to use instead of 
my main computer and, then, a
sync issue.<p>If Microsoft wants to do something
to get ahead, then they should
make much more clear how to
do <i>syncs</i>, backups, restores,
including of options on software,
and the boot partition, and how
to use a home computer as a
<i>server</i> for mobile devices,
e.g., give good explanations of
VPNs and other security issues
of opening my main computer to
access from mobile devices.<p>Finally, if I had a smartphone,
then it might get stolen, and
the data on it might be confidential.<p>Even worse, if the smartphone had
an easy way to get a VPN connection
back to my main computer as a server,
then maybe all of the data on my
main computer -- e.g., my software
which should be treated as a
trade secret -- could be stolen.<p>Also, now police seem to like to
take smartphones and look through
all the data, photographs, etc.
there and strain to find excuses
to start big legal cases.  Also,
with my smartphone in their hands
and a VPN connection back to my
main computer, they would 
also have my trade secret software.<p>If I
have no smartphone, then police
can&#x27;t grab it and violate my
Fourth Amendment rights.<p>If 
I had a smartphone and had it
visible and if there were some
police doing something or other,
then the police could go wacko
(they basically don&#x27;t like 
citizens recording or even 
watching what they do and know
that in practice they can
get away with a lot of
bullying of citizens they don&#x27;t like),
accuse me of taking their pictures,
rough me up, arrest me,
search my car, plant drugs in my
car and then charge me with
possession of drugs, take my
smartphone, etc.  They could
take my car.  In <i>searching</i>
my car, they could find excuses
to trash my car, e.g., cut open
the seats.
If I had a dog,
then they could find an excuse
to shoot my dog.  Just having
a smartphone could trigger some
not very nice police to get
me into a lot of legal trouble
for no more reason than my 
just having a smartphone.
Indeed, likely police are afraid
of smartphones.<p>With no
smartphone, police have 
fewer excuses to bully me
around, get their sadistic
enjoys, and get me into a
lot of legal trouble for
no reason at all.",1374202070

I&#x27;d like to work with people who are passionate enough to pay for their idea but might not be able to afford the actual price tag.<p>I currently have 2 apps in the App Store:

Payment: $100 up front, $100 on completion.<p>4. Design: If you have a design ready to go, I&#x27;ll implement it. Otherwise I&#x27;ll be using the native UI components. You&#x27;ll need to provide the app store icon and loading screens.<p>5. Back-end: If you have an API to use, I&#x27;ll use it. I can also use Parse, but you&#x27;re responsible for paying for it. I&#x27;ll also implement CoreData as necessary. If you need a more heavy back-end API component, you&#x27;ll need to build it yourself.<p>6. You own the code, but I can blog about how specific features were implemented. You can see examples of my blog posts on natashatherobot.com.<p>7.

Netflix over Wine works like a charm if not ideal (it&#x27;s broken for me a couple of times but it&#x27;s working again now) and HBO GO works even better.<p>3.

Frequently, the feature which saves Facebook/Google/Twitter login info for desktop apps would forget my password and generate blank popups and error reports.<p>6.

Sure, men may make you uncomfortable, pay you less, and make your overall self-esteem go down, and that&#x27;s an injustice, but the other knows, or can know, <i>everything</i> about you. Every out-of-line or could-be-racist comment that you have ever made, any weird porn site you accidentally stumbled upon one day, every angry message you have sent to an ex, any &quot;private&quot; confession you have made on the internet, everyone you care about, everything that you like or don&#x27;t like, your political and religious beliefs, can be pulled from these databases and used against you. And that is something that I don&#x27;t think the &quot;male gaze&quot; can do.<p>I will also say that I was not terribly surprised either. Neither were a lot of people. How could anyone believe their Facebook accounts would be kept private after reading Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s chat messages with his friends? (&quot;They trust me, dumbfucks&quot;). I don&#x27;t know how anyone believes what they say on the internet is private or &quot;anonymous&quot;, that is just so naive.

Ideally, after a couple of years of being run by a bankruptcy judge, and residents feeling the sting of things being cut, new blood comes into city management and takes advantage of the stabilized financial position to put the city on a course for the future. I think even if the bankruptcy process can&#x27;t bind the city government in the future, it does change the political climate. I think it will weaken the public unions, and I think the end of easy money through bond issuances will force greater fiscal discipline.<p>This might be overly optimistic.",1374199235

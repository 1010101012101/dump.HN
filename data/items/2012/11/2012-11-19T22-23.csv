Then my phone's app drawer would just be a page of words, which would blend themselves into a giant morass of meaningless letters, making it difficult indeed to find the app I'm seeking.  Likewise, I'd hate to see labels disappear in favor of icons--I'd never figure out what some of these things are.  What's that tri-colored Slow Moving Vehicle sign supposed to mean?  Oh! it's Google Drive! Of course!<p>I depend on the labels when I've just installed a new app on my phone.  After a while, when I've learned to visually associate the icon with the app, I depend on the icon to locate the app more quickly than scanning the labels.  The app's position within the app drawer changes frequently, so eidetic memory doesn't serve me well there.<p>I'd say there should be a setting within every app that allows you to display or hide the label, but even as I consider that, I reject it, because it gives the app drawer an inconsistent look.  And if I stop using an app for a while, I might forget what its icon looks like, and have to fall back on the labels again.",1353365964

Its natural to think we are selling snake oil, but contrary to your statement our product works very well and in-fact is equally or more accurate then most products on the market.  The cheap apps that you can download do a good job but are notorious for false triggers due to the iPhone's accelerometer sensitivity.  Not to mention it will pick up motion of your partner and can be easily knocked off the bed.  We make no claims to have medical grade sleep device, something like the Zeo may be more accurate but frankly I just don't understand why anyone would wear something on their head while they sleep.<p>Above all we wanted to create a product that was fun to use and would help shed light onto your sleeping patterns.",1353365958

4806757,comment,4805091,4805091,37,0,flyinglizard,,,"Here are my lessons after 6 years running a consulting firm in a pretty specialized business (high end ARM/embedded stuff), from the top of my head:<p>1. Avoid billing by hours, exactly for the reasons listed here. You can only lose like this; it carries more administration overhead, more friction with the customer and at the end there's a max budget allocated on the customer's end anyway - it's not like you can bill indefinitely if things don't go as planned.<p>2. Always charge fixed price for projects. Remember the budget allocation from #1? Use it. Bill twice as much in the beginning but avoid charging the customer even a penny more for delivering the work you're committed to, even if that means 'losing' money (you don't really lose when consulting, only earn less).<p>3. Work alone. Hiring people may seems like a good idea but then you've got a financial burden in the slower periods (and these always come when you least expect them). You can make good money alone, and you can make good (and great) money when you have 8+ people working for you but between 2 and 8 employees, you're busy full time getting enough work for the team and your margin on these employees simply isn't big enough (just think of the office costs). Besides, I don't like the whole pimping thing where you sell someone else's skills; YMMV.<p>4. You <i>are</i> a business problems solver. Don't tell a customer ""no"", just jack up the price if needed. If you intend to have a large project with them, don't charge them for general consultancy around the project. Happily give them your time for free; make your money on the project itself, not the meetings around it.<p>Edited to add something quite important, IMO: Whenever first meeting a customer, I try to get a high level picture of the business they are in, the product they are looking to develop, who will use it and so on - even if they are just looking for me to develop a specific component. It's very easy to fall into ""XY Problems"", and understanding the project environment would make it easier to assess the work and rates.<p>5. Remember there are people in a corporate environment on the other side. Make them look good in their company; give them whatever help needed and be their go-to guy. It's really important for the long term (and as fellow human beings). Don't ask for money for small modifications or changes, think of the administrative process they need for each line item - it makes them look incompetent or just annoys them with bureaucracy. You'll more than make up for that in the following work.<p>6. Long term, your entrepreneur skills are better spent at build your own business. Consulting is good for the free spirited folks that don't want a corporate environment, or for making a quick buck on some lucrative projects, but it's hardly a way to get rich and it's quite wearing in the long run.<p>Nevertheless, I think that professionally, consulting has been the greatest thing I could have done. The variety of projects, technologies and corporate environment (30+ customers here, most repeating) is great for your own development.",1353365891

It has the backing of MS, which in itself will guarantee a decent sized user base. Also, a large amount of Android's success is simply because its on cheap phones, and its the only alternative for the ""anything but iphone"" crowd. Everyone buys an iphone because its an iphone. I would wager the vast majority of Android sales are by default rather than because its an Android.

No attempt was made during their (thousand-year long) formulation (and certainly none during the reform), to design them so that their meaning was readily apparent from their form (Rather, most consist of a semantic classifier loosely classifying them based on meaning, and a ""phonetic"" component loosely hinting at their pronunciation). Thus, their lack of readily perceivable meaning has little bearing on the possibility of intentionally designed icons having readily perceivable meaning.<p>(Though not directly related to my point, I also must point out your assertion ""each depicting a single, well-defined language element and having just one unambiguous, official reading"" is false.

It's a matter of professionalism and willingness (and ability) to steer the project/engagement. Consultants are experts who come in and figure out how to achieve a goal, who investigate the clients' needs, who tell the client ""these are the steps we will need to take to figure this out, and then to make it happen."" At an advanced level, they will even help figure out the right goal to begin with.<p>Freelancers typically have to be told these steps by the client (and managed).<p>If you can come in and steer a project, and let the person hiring you relax his/her no doubt overworked brain for just a few hours, you can charge practically whatever you want. That's how we were doing $500+/hr (each) before we quit consulting, because I led the processes for our clients. They didn't mind paying $2k simply for meeting with us both for 2 hours because they got to be the subject of conversation, instead of the leader, and they'd get a valuable report out of it at the end (for an additional price, of course).<p>Never once had to worry about price shopping, because if that's the service you want, there is zero competition!<p>Foolishly, I thought this was just Normal Professional Behavior until I started hiring people for <i>my</i> business.<p>Sadly, it seems most people out there prefer the unprofessional and haphazard approach where they take on too much work/too many clients, wait for the client to tell them what to do, then jump between clients like a scalded cat to whichever project causes the most screaming at the moment.",1353365293

People who like one Apple product tend to like most Apple products because there is a clear thread of simplicity and elegance that runs through them.<p>I'm not sure what thread has traditionally run through Microsoft products (lots of buttons, lots of choices, lots of legacy?), but the Surface, with its vertical integration model, and Metro, with its ""non-power user"" interface, breaks that thread.

I have done pretty well, charging easily 1K Euro a day, less in the last couple of years.<p>Last year, with a colleague and friend, we started our consulting company. The main reason for that being ""let's scale!"". We contacted a bunch of freelance colleagues we trusted and respected and asked them to join us as hired guns, whenever we needed more workforce.<p>Another reason for starting a company was that the developer profession is not rewarded as the experience increases. At least in Europe, a 3-4 years experience Java developer can make almost as much as a 10 years experience Java expert. And there are rate roofs which are hardly crossable, so even if you are really really good and have plenty of war stories, still the 1K/day roof is pretty hard to cross.<p>So far, it didn't go exactly as expected. We are doing ok, we have some clients (we are in the Java space, so mostly enterprise stuff) but nothing spectacular. We are having an hard time acquiring new clients and the long running European crisis doesn't help.<p>I'm working considerably more than in the past (weekends are a rare commodity, very long days, in short my work/life balance is critically crappy), so sometime I wonder if it's worth the hassle.<p>The scalability part is very tough: we hired one guy (who was a disappointment) and we use our trusted hired guns, who are often busy with their own consulting gig. Therefore, we are crazy busy.<p>Another problem is that the clients are really interested in our specific experience: that means they want to work with me or my partner, not with the company. This bit is hard to crack.<p>In short we are still figuring out how to go from here.<p>We will invest more in the web site and technical blog (we are also co-authoring a book) and we will hire one or two permanent devs (did I mention that hiring someone in Europe is bloody expensive, so that the 70% billable time mentioned in the article is too low?).<p>Working solo is easy, scaling is not.

Is there no one near you who needs a sysadmin? Could you travel?

Once you charge per week (or per incident, based on a standard weekly rate), you can start talking about ""OK, you want to spend less, which things should I not do"", not ""Well, I think I'm worth $50 an hour, but since I need the money, I'll take the job for $20""<p>Yes, for systems administration it can work that way.

E.g. the result is a large string, you need the compiler for de-serialization... all in all, if you look at current Smalltalks, this feature is not used too much.<p>Saving the whole state of the world to an image is not implemented by using #storeString. Instead it saves the whole heap of the vm to a file. Very fast, but of course this means that the resulting file is specific for 32bit vs. 64bit, endianess... and, very important, object layout (Object Headers are saved as they are in memory). So it is not really serialisation in the classic meaning of the word.<p>2) Implementing storeString like in Smalltalk needs some reflective features, e.g. enumerating instance variables, setting instance variables after creating new objects when recreating. And the compiler needs to be part of the language, as the string is one huge Smalltalk expression.<p>3) For image snapshotting serialization is not really the correct term.
The memory is just written from RAM to Disk. For #storeString, yes, this is serialization.<p>For more infos about a modern binary serializer for Smalltalk, see Fuel:

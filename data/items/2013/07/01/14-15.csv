5971068,comment,5970187,5970187,1,0,greghinch,,,"We Are Pop Up - London, UK - Web Application Developer (full-time)<p>We Are Pop Up is a community-driven marketplace for short-term commercial property leasing. While we certainly didn&#x27;t invent the concept of a &quot;pop up shop&quot;, we&#x27;re embracing it whole-heartedly as a solution to two social problems which have arisen in our  time: 1) How can we lower the barrier-to-entry to enable a new generation of retail, food, and creative entrepreneurs to operate as easily in the offline world as businesses currently do online? 2) As commerce increasingly moves online, vacant property is left behind, which can have detrimental effects on both the nearby businesses and the greater community alike. How can we find new ways of filling that space? The missing piece which transforms these two real problems into mutual solutions is an excellent software platform that removes the time and overhead typically associated with commercial leasing. We Are Pop Up officially launched this platform near the end of 2012, and has already given numerous creative entrepreneurs around the UK opportunities to engage the offline world in ways they never had before.<p>We&#x27;re looking for an experienced Web Application Developer to work directly along side our Lead Developer and Creative Director, building features and scaling the platform. Someone who&#x27;s comfortable working with the whole stack, understands the principles of excellent software development, and wants to treat their code as their craft. We&#x27;re primarily in a Django/Python environment, but any relevant experience is great, as long as you are willing to learn Python. The number of years you&#x27;ve been working professionally isn&#x27;t too important (though it should be at least &quot;a few&quot;), but what you&#x27;ve done is. Being an expert in SQL will get you a lot of points. We follow Agile development practices, and you&#x27;ll be shipping features frequently.<p>--<p>Skills and Attributes We&#x27;re Looking For (being 100% in all is not required, but candidates who are will receive preference)<p>* Experience building web applications from the bottom, up. Django/Python experience preferred, but Rails/Ruby, PHP, etc. is also great, so long as you&#x27;re a quick and willing learner<p>* Solid knowledge of SQL and related best practices. We use Postgres, but are happy with MySQL or similar experience<p>* Ability to work in Javascript/HTML/CSS. We use YUI 3 and Bootstrap. You certainly don&#x27;t need to be a designer, but you should be able to take on a feature and fully implement it, including all relevant front-end code<p>* General understanding of Solr/Lucene search<p>* Experience deploying basic server infrastructure and with the Unix command line (being an expert SysAdmin is not required)<p>* Familiarity with code profiling and optimization<p>* Interested in things like Agile development, TDD, and pair-programming<p>* Work equally well in close coordination with others and independently/self-directed. We&#x27;re a small team, so we&#x27;ll always be working closely, sometimes in pairs, but often you&#x27;ll need to be able to take on things on your own<p>* Legally eligible to work in the UK (mandatory)<p>What We&#x27;re Offering<p>* Competitive salary, based on experience<p>* Meaningful, early-employee equity<p>* Regularly attend some of the coolest pop-up events and parties in London<p>* Work on a developer-driven software team, where your contributions will have a hugely positive impact on the lives of others<p>More About Us<p>We&#x27;re a group of Brits and Americans who came together in the spring of 2012 to take on an ambitious idea cooked up by 2 of our co-founders in a pub one evening (where all good ideas start). We&#x27;re artists and environmentalists, consultants and entrepreneurs, engineers and educators. Collectively we&#x27;ve worked with Fortune 500s, government and the public sector, universities, creatives, small businesses, and (other) start-ups. We&#x27;re alumni of Springboard Mobile in the fall of 2012 and we&#x27;re looking to change the world.<p>Principals only, no recruiters<p>Please submit your CV, a paragraph summarizing your relevant experience, and links to your work on Github, Bitbucket, etc. to jobs[at]wearepopup.com, with the subject &quot;Hacker News candidate for your Web Application Developer role&quot;<p>We look forward to hearing from you!",1372690719

Normally for in house things, so I&#x27;ve had the benefit of warning for demand.<p>But it gives me the nicety of fast to dev tools, the fact maintaining C# code is almost pleasurable at times, with good performance.<p>Sure some custom C in Linux kernel land system will be faster, but the price performance is really good.<p>Comparing MVC 4 to Ruby on Rails and Django for a new project, the performance of MVC4 was an order of magnitude better under load.<p>But at the last HN meetup I went to in London they were taking an informal survey of languages.  Despite having Erland and Lisp mentioned, the hosts didn&#x27;t ask about C# or F#, despite my knowledge of at least 10 people there heavily in to it, I&#x27;d have guessed at least 30 people must have been.<p>You also get some bizarre comments, a friend of mine who spends most of his time in just one nameless language, half ask/told some people that Asp.Net doesn&#x27;t scale...  Some people have a religious zeal against it I think.  Which is a shame, C# is a great language, and if people want to &#x27;stick it to MS&#x27; go contribute on mono instead of bitching about MS!",1372690714

5971054,comment,5968466,5969910,3,0,rayiner,,,"Nobody &quot;owns&quot; the soil, not really. &quot;Ownership&quot; is a fiction--nothing more than an implied agreement between you and a big enough group of other people that if someone tries to displace you from a particular patch of soil, the group will forcibly remove that person. The U.S. governments (the federal and states) don&#x27;t &quot;own&quot; the soil within the borders of the U.S., but have exclusive jurisdiction to enforce ownership agreements on U.S. soil for no greater or lesser reason other than the fact that they can defend those borders against outsiders.<p>It is interesting that you mention slavery. No amount of bleeting about &quot;natural rights&quot; will keep armed people from enslaving you, as has happened countless times throughout history. Your &quot;right&quot; to freedom is nothing more or less than your agreement with a sufficiently large group of other people that they will defend you against people trying to enslave you. The history of slavery in the U.S. actually exemplifies this. The 13th amendment didn&#x27;t end slavery.

Sadly, we are no longer catering to these people: viewing a website without JS enabled should not render the fundamental content of the website unavailable, and we have forsaken that ideal in favor of fancy bells and whistles on our pages.<p>There&#x27;s a fourth reason, as well: JS should not be required on grounds of security, not just privacy. Sites should not have to run what is essentially unsafe, privileged, arbitrary code in order to do their daily business. A company might claim that their JS is harmless because it only animates a title bar or powers a dropdown menu, but proving that requires a manual audit of all JS on the page, which amounts to thousands of lines of JS on a modern site. (Have <i>you</i> read through the copy of jQuery being served to you? Probably not.) Common repositories of JS ameliorate the problem somewhat, but it can&#x27;t be eliminated.<p>This is not okay, by the way. Requiring JS to read a news article, or upload an image, or view a forum thread, is insane and we should not tolerate it.",1372689542

It depends on the situation, and a good software _engineer_ should be able to reason about the trade-offs of using statically/dynamically typed languages in each situation.<p>In this case, it is about shifting the costs to different stages of the projects lifecycle. Statically typed languages require more mental effort while developing, and, by definition, catch more bugs early in the process (compiler has more information to play with, and the programmer is required to be more thorough). Pushing it even further, formal proof systems require exponentially more effort at development time, and, in some cases, rewards it with the proof of software correctness (i.e. no bug-fixing costs at maintenance stage). On the other end of spectrum, dynamically typed languages allow for much faster development (which can be mission critical), but a rapid release comes with a price of long-term maintenance difficulties.<p>It&#x27;s up to the developer to choose which approach is the most appropriate for the situation (amongst the myriad of other trade-offs, like performance, scalability, user requirements, existing infrastructure and so on).",1372689246

5970789,comment,5969938,5970409,5,0,JunkDNA,,,"Thanks for that post, I think the point I was making was slightly different. I&#x27;m arguing that with web programming you lack the end to end control you might have in a closed system. You depend on all sorts of input from users, your data is stored in a database or nosql store that is outside your program&#x27;s (and compiler&#x27;s) complete control. It can change underneath you at any time. The argument that static typing can help you know that your code is correct is weakened in this environment. Internally you of course construct your code in a way that uses types and can verify that you are internally consistent. However, I&#x27;m saying that at a fundamental level, in a data-driven web app, the system as a whole is only marginally improved by this because your whole universe starts out with a bunch of typecast operations as the gateway to your codebase. These always are happening at runtime and are one &quot;ALTER TABLE&quot; (to pick just one example) away from failing spectacularly in production.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing one way or another that static typing is/is not good in this scenario. I&#x27;m just pointing out that the foundation of the system as a whole is not as solid as other programming scenarios where you have much more control.",1372688440

Mozilla is working hard to push those APIs through W3C and encourage others to implement them. But that is a slow process and it remains to be seen if the other players want to do that.<p>In theory, it will work anywhere, eventually. But today, almost every single FirefoxOS applications can run unchanged on Android (using Firefox for Android). Most of them can also work on laptop/desktop (using regular Firefox). That&#x27;s already way better than whatever Android or iOS offer.<p>> 2) Only if those applications are completely standalone and do not depend on server side components.

5970751,comment,5970248,5970435,8,0,bhauer,,,"This--and by &quot;this&quot; I mean cultural or philosophical differences--is what I feel is ultimately behind the stark performance gulf described in the OP&#x27;s article.<p>I love Microsoft&#x27;s technologies.  I use Windows on my development environment (even though I don&#x27;t do Windows development; I know, I am crazy).  I own a Surface and a Nokia Lumia phone.  Nevertheless, I also know that there&#x27;s nothing absolutely fast about Microsoft&#x27;s web stack [1].<p>I suspect what is at play here, instead, is one side being efficient with resources and the other being reckless.<p>My opinion is that some platforms and frameworks come bundled with a set of philosophical characteristics that most practitioners adopt.  Some popular open source web frameworks include a poster of Knuth&#x27;s famous quote about premature optimization and adopters consider that quote to mean more than it does, thereby expressly avoiding spending time thinking about performance because doing so might lead to time spent on optimizing code and that is evil.<p>Further, in our efforts to capture production-grade deployment instructions for many open source frameworks, we were left wanting, often having to turn to community opinion rather than specific instructions.  Many frameworks&#x27; communities were Balkanized, leading to uncertainty about the best performing production-grade configuration.<p>It&#x27;s not surprising when systems get built and deployed without any performance benchmarking, let alone tuning.  I have no idea what &quot;Charm&quot; was or if it suffered from this sort of thing, but I&#x27;ve seen the described situation before and suspect it&#x27;s fairly common.<p>Meanwhile, although I&#x27;ve not been a Windows developer, I suspect their culture comes bundled with a modest helping of being mindful of CPU and disk resources and preparation for production deployments.  Microsoft is too friendly with corporate IT to leave production deployments a guessing game.<p>Finally, perhaps the OP in particular is just especially careful about performance, perhaps without even consciously making it a priority.  Certainly none of us think it should be especially difficult for an m1.large server to process hundreds of thousands of dynamic web requests per day.  It&#x27;s more instructive to me, frankly, that we have come to think that is noteworthy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/</a>",1372688114

5970748,comment,5967695,5970292,3,0,graycat,,,"If Obamacare really is better for US health care and\npatients, both soon and long term, and not wildly\nmore expensive, then fine with me.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much Obama&#x27;s for Obamacare:  He has\nmade lots of <i>supportive</i> comments, but he also\nclaims to want to shut down the coal plants.  He&#x27;s\ngoing to do next to nothing on the second, so maybe\non the first he&#x27;s just spouting stuff.  From his\nremarks that the American College of Surgeons shot\ndown, I doubt that Obama really knows enough about\nUS health care to like Obamacare very much.<p>For Obama &quot;stuck his neck out&quot;, I don&#x27;t see it.  The\nbill passed due to the Dem majority in both houses\nof Congress and the pushing of Pelosi, Reid, and\nEmanuel, and from all I can tell Obama had little to\ndo with it.  Now that the bill is law, he can praise\nit.<p>As <i>Obamacare</i>, Obama&#x27;s name got attached to the\nbill and the effort, but that was mostly just\npolitics by people who don&#x27;t like either Obama or\nthe bill and similar to what was done with <i>Hillary\ncare</i> because it was obvious that we shouldn&#x27;t trust\nour health care system to Hillary.  And nearly no\none would really want to trust their health care to\nanything designed or implemented by Obama.<p>On the act itself, no doubt US health care could be\nimproved.  Just how to do that is a serious\nquestion.  There is the <i>academic health care\nsystems analysis economic optimization planning</i>\ncommunity with Karen Davis, etc., but I&#x27;ve been too\nclose to such academics and wouldn&#x27;t trust them to\nhand me a band aid.  Maybe what Switzerland,\nSingapore, Sweden have is better.  It appears that\nlots of people complain about what England and\nCanada have.<p>I was for improving the US health care system, but\nwhen I saw the <i>sausage making</i> that resulted in\nObamacare, I concluded that the hard work of\ndesigning a better system had not been done.  E.g.,\nI saw that what was proposed had been taken off the\nshelf from some work by Senator Kennedy&#x27;s health\ncare planning staff.  Kennedy was dreaming; such\ndreams are a good way to kill patients and waste\nmoney.<p>My fear is that as Obamacare goes into\nimplementation, it will seriously hurt US health\ncare and millions of patients -- some soon, much\nmore later.  And as the IRS goes around plucking\nmoney from checking accounts, people might get\ntorqued.<p>Pelosi&#x27;s remark &quot;got to pass it to see what&#x27;s in it&quot;\nmay have a point:  It may be that heavily what the\nimplementation is will be from <i>regulations</i> written\nby rows, columns, and layers of paper pushers in\nsome big building about 70 miles from the Washington\nMonument.<p>So, Obamacare will be implemented slowly.  Maybe as\nproblems become obvious and people scream, the paper\npushers will modify the system.  I hope so.  Due to\nthe slow implementation, there will be some time to\nmodify the system as it is implemented.<p>Here is some of what I suspect will happen.  In the\nshort term, people won&#x27;t like the changes if only\nbecause they are changes.  Then people will really\nnot like the role of the IRS.  In the long term, I\nsuspect that a lot of the best people and companies\nwill leave health care and, then, quality will fall.\nGetting the quality back will be super tough.  I\nsuspect that the flow of new, advanced, powerful\nbiomedical products -- drugs, devices -- will\ngreatly slow.  I believe that a lot of seniors will\nget much worst medical care.  The Palin image of\n&quot;death panels&quot; is not really wrong.<p>US health care is a patchwork system pulled together\npiece by piece over nearly all the decades of modern\nmedicine.  In some ways, the system works great,\nlikely the best in the world.  In some other ways,\nit&#x27;s not very good.  So, improvements are possible.\nBut improvements are not going to be easy, that is,\nwithout damaging a lot that is good or spending too\nmuch money.<p>My fear of Obamacare is that it was mostly just a\npolitical football and from nothing like a serious\neffort to design a better system.  Instead, the\npolitical part was, really, just the Kennedy dream,\na dream of &#x27;good health care as a basic right for\neveryone&#x27; or some such essentially socialistic\nnotion.  Pelosi?  She wants more socialism from a\nbigger government.  With Obamacare she was as happy\nas the lead high school cheerleader just named\nHomecoming Queen.  The political part is that Pelosi\ntook the old Kennedy dream and pushed it through,\nthat is, pushed through that the US is on the way to\nsocialized medicine.  So, in the US socialized\nmedicine is now a fact that will be difficult to\nchange.<p>That&#x27;s what Pelosi wanted -- the principle of\nsocialized medicine, that the Federal Government is\ndirectly responsible for the health care of everyone.\nJust what the details will be and how it will work,\nPelosi didn&#x27;t care.  Instead she will let the\nExecutive Branch iron out any winkles and have\nCongress modify the law in places if necessary.  But\nwhat she wants is socialized medicine; she&#x27;s\nconfident it will be better.  So, again, especially\nto Pelosi, Obamacare was politics, that is,\nsocialized medicine, socialism, having the central\ngovernment directly responsible for each person&#x27;s\nhealth care, and not really about how to design a\nbetter health care system.  Good, bad, or otherwise,\nPelosi wants socialized medicine and just trusts\nthat it will be good.<p>Socialism keeps being attractive; has been around\nthe world for about 100 years.  Some of the\nattractions are that everyone gets together, joins\nhands, sings Kumbayah, and sets up the central\ngovernment as responsible for some aspect of their\nfinancial, material, etc. security.  They assume\nthat, with everyone joined together, the idea can&#x27;t\nfail.  So, no more rich people, no more poor people,\neveryone just the same and good.  The sales pitch\nhas worked off and on seriously for about 100 years.\nThat&#x27;s what Pelosi wants -- socialism.  She&#x27;s a true\nbeliever.<p>Mostly people who try socialism find that it&#x27;s\ndarned expensive -- have the central government\nspending ballpark 50% of GDP and doing the spending\nas <i>politics</i> and, thus, inefficiently.  The\nThatcher remark was &quot;The problem with socialism is\nthat eventually you run out of other people&#x27;s\nmoney&quot;.  In the USSR the workers concluded &quot;They\npretend to pay us, and we pretend to work.&quot;.  Russia\nfinally totally gave up and went back to a wild west\nshow.  East Germany got rid of socialism ASAP.\nFrance keeps struggling with high costs, slow\neconomic growth, high unemployment.<p>Switzerland?  It&#x27;s wealthy with a lot of healthy\npeople.  So, they have a shot at pulling off\nsocialized medicine.  The Scandinavian countries?\nThey are big into socialism and are accepting their\ncentral government spending ballpark 50% of GDP.\nAlso the countries are small and culturally\nhomogeneous, and where they are not so homogeneous\nrecently they have been encountering big problems.<p>In the end I believe that you will discover that\nObamacare is really not about health care, really is\na threat to good US health care, and really was and\nis about politics, in particular, some of the dreams\nof socialism.<p>One of the dreams of socialism is a basic income for\neveryone with an opportunity for more for anyone who\nwants to work for more.  Fine with me except for one\nlittle point -- arithmetic.  So far in the US, it\ndoesn&#x27;t add up.  That is, productivity is not high\nenough.  Instead, it is still the case that for the\nproductivity the US needs to keep the cars moving\nand the store shelves stocked, the hospitals and\nschools working, the software written and the Web\nsites up, etc., some people have to work darned hard\nand with the &quot;basic income&quot; provided wouldn&#x27;t.  So,\nwe still need the motivation of free enterprise.\nHopefully with more robots we will have enough\nproductivity to make the arithmetic work.<p>I believe that, as health care, Obamacare gets a\ngrade of D- for its design work, that it really is\nnot about health care but is about politics, really a\nsocialistic dream of Pelosi; I believe that\nsocialism won&#x27;t work yet in the US, and the\nObamacare, due heavily to its bad design work, will\nboth in the short term and especially in the longer\nterm seriously hurt US health care.

Even blind people no longer run their browsers with JS disabled [1]. As long as the content and navigation make semantic sense, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any reason for a web designer or developer to refrain from adding frills with JS nowadays, any more than there is reason to refrain from using CSS. Both are integral parts of the package of specifications we call HTML5.<p>If a user even bothers to disable JS, he&#x27;s intentionally asking you for a different experience, so give him a different experience! As long as the text is readable and the navigation links point to the right URLs, there&#x27;s no need to try to make the <noscript> experience identical to the normal experience. No sane developer tries to make the no-CSS experience (e.g. lynx) identical to the normal experience, right?<p>My only complaint is with certain websites that make absolutely gratuitous use of JS, like using AJAX to load the text content of the page. That belongs to the same category as using tables for the entire layout. You don&#x27;t go about disabling <table> tags just because people abuse it in annoying ways.<p>[1] <a href=""http://a11yproject.com/posts/myth-screen-readers-dont-use-javascript/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://a11yproject.com/posts/myth-screen-readers-dont-use-ja...</a>",1372688096

Fixating on types is focusing on the wrong thing. You need to understand the object inheritance tree, not the types.<p>Whether or not that makes your code unmaintainable is up to you, it helps if you keep your classes small and give each of them a well-defined and documented purpose.

I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s a bad thing (frankly, big Wall Street funded corporations are much more efficient than small local businesses), but I do detect some cognitive dissonance in people who rail against big corporations but also support companies like Uber.",1408301999

8190086,story,,,37,50,okatsu,"Ask HN: Choosing between Microsoft and everything else",,"I&#x27;m a software engineering student in his twenties. My work experience has mostly been with Windows technologies (.NET, SQL Server, Windows Server, etc.) and Java for Jenkins plugins. At home, I have a Windows PC and a Macbook, but mostly develop on the latter with frameworks like Django and Rails, in Vim.<p>I know a guy at work in his fifties who long ago decided to use Microsoft technologies exclusively, and I&#x27;ve never seen someone so happy to code, because he only has one ecosystem to work with and it works well. I&#x27;ve also been bit by the Microsoft bug, but I can&#x27;t bring myself to use their tools outside of work. Visual Studio&#x27;s a great IDE (especially as of late), and C# is a really fun language, but the license costs are enormous, MSDNAA licenses are for personal use only, and Azure generally costs a lot more than a VM on Linode or Digital Ocean. BizSpark also isn&#x27;t an option unless you&#x27;re seriously starting a business.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m at a crossroads of sorts, like my coworker once has been. I prefer my experience with Microsoft, but its costs and vendor lock-in are hard to ignore. I&#x27;ve tried Mono, and it&#x27;s slowly getting there, but until vNext is production-ready and I can give it a serious try, I won&#x27;t consider it a viable option.<p>I&#x27;d just like to know if anyone else has had this experience, and if so, what led them to choose one path over another. Any advice is also welcome.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;d just like to clarify that I&#x27;m not trying to choose one platform for the rest of my life, in every aspect of it. I don&#x27;t mind learning one tool over another in a work context, but I have an interest for the startup/entrepreneurial world, and that&#x27;s when choosing Microsoft isn&#x27;t as easy as choosing anything else.",1408301782

8190083,comment,8188374,8189667,2,0,ScottBurson,,,"Fantastic comment overall.  This surprises me, though:<p>> Done wrong [unschooling] can set your children up for a fantastic career barely making ends meet.<p>In a world where many people change careers several times as adults, this seems unnecessarily pessimistic.  Okay, maybe their first career won&#x27;t be that lucrative.  Most people don&#x27;t make that much in their twenties anyway.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t find something better eventually.<p>In the economy of the 21st century, I think pursuing one&#x27;s own passions is a likelier route to success than trying to follow the well-worn paths.  No, there&#x27;s no guarantee of success that way, but the well-worn paths offer no guarantees either.  What I think is important in childhood and adolescence is to spend enough time and effort on <i>something</i> to come away with a sense of mastery, so that you feel that you can master anything else that you care to, and you have some idea of what&#x27;s required to do that.  But it doesn&#x27;t matter what the &quot;something&quot; is.  It&#x27;s the <i>experience</i> that counts, not the information; information is free now.<p>Still and all, I agree partially with what you&#x27;re saying.  If I had kids, there would be things I would want them to know.  (Many of these are not taught in any school, like how to deconstruct advertising -- an essential skill in modern life -- but that&#x27;s another discussion.)  I would certainly try to interest them in many topics.  But I would try to do it at the right moment -- if they have no interest, it&#x27;s not the right moment -- and I would also very much try to support them in developing their own interests.<p>I guess the unschooling idea could go too far if parents took it as devaluing their own potential contributions to their children&#x27;s learning opportunities.  Maybe some of that tends to happen.  I don&#x27;t think John Holt meant it that way.",1408301675

Also, it&#x27;s not even entirely clear whether on the whole, the FDA saves more lives than it harms.

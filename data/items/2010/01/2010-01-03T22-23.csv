Meaning, either fully automated driving or don't help me at all. I just can't help but imagine that I'd never be able to get used to this type of selective assistance. Someone cutting you off doesn't necessarily mean you're headed for a crash and no cars in front of you doesn't necessarily mean you can drive 80 mph without caution. If you grow to rely on a system such as this, it only takes one incident where the vehicle doesn't believe it's about to be in a crash when you really are for it to ultimately fail. Or worse yet, for the car to sense you may be in a crash and apply counter measures which causes panic by the driver and ultimately leads to a crash anyway due to overcorrection or something similar.",1262559248

Tired of messing with slow trac installs on PHP or fugly-looking/complicated PHP tools (I'm watching you, bugzilla!). It is mainly targeted towards the types of projects I've seen were useful for development with the clients and staff I work with as a student working in a university and freelancing on the side. It will definitely allow me to sleep a little better on the weekends and keep everyone on my team up to date as to what they need to get done and where projects stand.<p>The second is a generic file upload system that will likely be used within the android hacking community to track resources etc. This one is actually very far along it's development after only two days of real development, and I am quite happy with it.

Ultimately, your co-founders are the ones who would protect your proverbial back and the more that they bring to the table (that are not already on the table), the better. In fact, the less that you have in common initially with each other, the less baggage that you each would bring to the partnership. Over the years, I have learned painfully that in addition to learning to work with people who are different from you and would initially make you uncomfortable, we need to refrain from starting our company with family and friends. Starting a company together is the quickest way to destroy friendship. Starting a company with family (or hiring family into your company) is the surest way to alienate your business partners.<p>Sex and startups, two things in life that are best to pursue outside your gene pool.",1262558520

Government sponsored agencies also contributed heavily to the meltdown.<p>I also don't think it is true to say that there was a massive shift of assets from middle class to already very well off given that it is the rich who largely suffered the most from this meltdown (given that it was an asset pricing bubble and it is the rich who tend to be the ones who hold more assets).

I'm saying these guys have put effort into something and they will look for a way to distribute. They will try, even if they know their content doesn't have much of a market, and there will always be these films and people who make these films. These films will probably make up the majority of films produced. So this is simply one monetizable group.<p>This is in fact Lulu.com's business model. Lulu.com wants to sell a service to low quality content. Of course my ultimate goal is not just to cater to these people, but to target this service to content of all quality, and then create a marketplace later of higher quality content (once they come). I believe that with the internet, and with the speed of communication, managing marketing and distribution is accomplished much more easily.<p>So yes in a sense our immediate revenue model isn't too legit, because we don't really care if films succeed in making money, but our goal is to charge them very little, hope the volume makes up for the difference, and rely on the mass of new films that just don't make it to resort to our service.<p>Initially it will be do-it-yourself service for films that aren't good enough to be distributed otherwise, but the long term goal is to offer better films a more profitable distribution method.<p>And who knows, maybe one of these 90 minute low quality films that everyone ignores turns out to be a smash hit (<a href=""http://www.theroommovie.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theroommovie.com/</a>).",1262556937

This code should be better...really it should just benchmark all the options and catch processor exceptions to pick a supported path.<p>Instead, the idea is to do a static dispatch for 'known' chips, which is really bad. When the Core2Duo came out, the version of IPP we used reverted to basic MMX code instead of SSE2, about 2.5x slower. This is just bad code, and it's bad on Intel chips, not just AMD.<p>Also there is the ""optimized for benchmarking"" piece. It's not always good to use all your cores for one job, for instance, but a lot of these libraries make the assumption that your CPU has nothing else to do.",1262556853

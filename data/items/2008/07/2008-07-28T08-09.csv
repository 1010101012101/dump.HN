258905,story,,,3,1,curiousgeorge,"Online Credit Card Processing for Non-Americans",,"A similar question was asked about a year ago [http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=88263], but there weren't any useful answers and I'm hoping there is better advice to be had these days, since I am running into the same problem.<p>Short story: I'm running a BVI-incorporated firm with a corporate bank account in Hong Kong and am trying to figure out ways to accept online credit card payments. The business is completely legitimate.<p>I've looked at several of the service providers recommended in other threads, but they all seem to require companies to have US merchant accounts. I am not an American citizen and it isn't feasible for me to travel to the US to open a corporate bank account there in person.<p>Does anyone have any recommendations on merchant service providers that ""get it""? Providing the necessary documentation to establish legal merchant accounts or fulfill regulatory requirements is not the problem. The problem is location.<p>Anyone have suggestions or advice?",1217235448

258903,comment,258198,258277,0,0,wheels,,,"I find that blog post characteristic of what's wrong with academia.  Lisi's obviously not a nutjob, and obviously not an idiot, and he's treated with contempt for proposing a big idea that might be wrong; might even be spectacularly wrong.  Academia as a whole would usually rather see people get back in line and go on solving irrelevant problems.  I found it encouraging that in the originally linked article that he at least did find some people in the scientific community that would treat him with a modicum of respect even if it was just in taking the time to explain why his theory doesn't fit the bill.",1217235338

258895,comment,258766,258891,0,0,geuis,,,"But don't you see that this book was a very shallow? As a piece of work, setting aside the pre-singularity tie-ins, the story was boring and the characters were uninterresting. The technology aspects of the story did little to actually explore near-term implementations of emerging tech in little more than glossing ways. There was little original thought in this book and was little more than VV's recent speeches of the last few years.",1217234272

Nothing fundamentally huge changes in most of these editions, so the students keep getting ripped off as they need to buy new editions and old editions become harder to sell.<p>I wonder what would happen if lots of students and faculty members from all over grouped together to refuse to buy such editions? In my dreams, but just to make a point to the publishers. I can only imagine how much of the cost of a new textbook is pure profit for the publishers and authors.",1217233679

258891,comment,258766,258838,0,0,skmurphy,,,"I am not sure we read the same book. This was an outstanding look at the near future. Three things off the top of my head that I took away as insightful:<p>1. As computing gets cheaper and basic AI/pattern recognition follows suite, the ability to get a group of human experts to collaborate becomes more valuable. 
2. The ""Rip Van Winkle"" effect of an Alzheimer's patient waking up after a cure is found and having to go back to high school (or what voc/tech school has become) allowed for an interesting exploration of how little impact computers have had to date on K-12 education and how much they are going to.
3. The portrayal of the military as an enhanced system administration function was interesting and matches what Barnett is proposing in ""Pentagon's New Map.""<p>It's not the far future space opera of ""Marooned in Real Time"" or ""A Fire Upon the Deep""--both of which I also enjoyed--but it's about a lot more than ""some old people trying keep some books from being destroyed.""",1217233519
258890,comment,258752,258752,0,0,petercooper,,,"I have an ""old"" server running Rails 1.x apps on Apache 1.3 using FastCGI. It's been surprisingly reliable, and has hosted apps without significant issues for over three years now (my first Rails deployment was December 2004). All of these apps use MySQL.<p>My ""new"" server is, again, Apache 1.3 but using SwitchPipe ( <a href=""http://switchpipe.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://switchpipe.org/</a> ) which is a lot more reliable as it manages the mongrel and thin processes I am using. However, in the future I anticipate I will move to Phusion Passenger ( <a href=""http://modrails.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://modrails.com/</a> ). I am starting to use SQLite3 more in apps.

258889,comment,258578,258578,0,0,silencio,,,"I'm not sure I agree with him. I have an iPhone 3G. My boyfriend is a die hard anti-Apple fanboy (sigh, us two are complete opposites) and has a samsung blackjack II and is tempted to get a blackberry bold when released. One of his coworkers has an n95 he loves to death.<p><i>All three of us</i> have pretty pathetic battery life on 3g.<p>My iPhone only dies faster than their two phones because they won't stop playing crash bandicoot, dizzy bee, tap tap revenge, and de blob on my phone. Meanwhile there's really nothing interesting to do on their phones besides snoop on their emails and the games that exist for windows mobile etc. aren't really...as fun. That is all.<p>(Also, the above would correspond with my opinion and experience that <i>all</i> 3G smartphones have awful battery life anyway, so if that's the only reason why he switched then that's not much of one.<p>He says he mostly does email and voice calls though. I don't know where he lives that his calls are dropped and he gets little to no signal, but my iPhone gets comparable signal to the two other smartphones and I've never had a dropped call (except when I was a couple floors underground). I will admit I almost never actually call anyone on my phone though; total talk time in 1 year and 1 month is around 1 day 6 hours. But I do lots of email! And it's a perfectly fine device for that. Just those blasted games that everyone wants to play...)",1217233343

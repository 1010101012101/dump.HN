For instance, he mentions that you should ignore your g.p.a. . He talks about finding a bunch of citations from his professors his senior year, because he never looked at the letter with his g.p.a.

459222,comment,458663,458992,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"I did not get the same behavior as you when I tried this just now - rather, I had:<p><pre><code>  > x.a = 10
  > print(#x)
  0
  >
</code></pre>
Which makes more sense than 1.  At the same time, 3 is also a valid value of #x, because it is the integer index of a value directly preceding an index with a nil value.<p>This behavior has been hashed over on the mailing list multiple times... the exact wording of the documentation allows for it but it's not exactly what people expect of the length operator.<p><i>The length of a table t is defined to be any integer index n such that t[n] is not nil and t[n+1] is nil; moreover, if t[1] is nil, n can be zero. For a regular array, with non-nil values from 1 to a given n, its length is exactly that n, the index of its last value. If the array has ""holes"" (that is, nil values between other non-nil values), then #t can be any of the indices that directly precedes a nil value (that is, it may consider _any_ such nil value as the end of the array).</i> -- From the manual<p>My expectation is that there will be some changes to the handling of the # operator in 5.2 increasing its usefulness and allowing it to be overridden via metatables for user-defined types.<p>In any case, this is one of the few currently ugly corners of the language itself. Another would be the handling of destructuring varargs via the select(...) function, which can be really funky.",1233376341

I haven't even had time to really review them, but it just helps me to stay aware of how I'm using my time. There's something about forcing myself to right down how much time I'm wasting that keeps my breaks short. I'd really recommend people try it for a few days.

459218,comment,457602,459133,0,0,inerte,,,"Dashes vs. underscores are different because search engines see dashes as spaces, so /my-cool-blog is actually /my cool blog while /my_cool_blog is /my_cool_blog (a single word :)<p>Here's a page where Matt Cutts, head of Webspam on Google, explain: <a href=""http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/dashes-vs-underscores/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/dashes-vs-underscores/</a> Several other people working with SEO have come independently with this observation. And I am pretty sure I've seen a page from an Yahoo guy saying the same thing (but can't find right now).<p>dir/ecto/ries are used to divide content into ""sections"". One good example is:<p>/news/sports/basketball - News about basketball<p>/news/sports - Sports news<p>/news - All news<p>So you can have /news/politics and /news/economy too.<p>While if you do:<p>/news-sports-basketball it doesn't look like the division is there. Think a few years ago, when url mapping/rewrite wasn't much used. The / character was a actual physical folder/directory on the machine. Therefore, if you were a search engine, you would assume that everything under /news/sports/basketball falls into a ""cluster"" of related content. You would think that probably /news/sports/basketball/1 and /news/sports/basketball/2 are related.<p>Programmers don't click ads, FACT. Maybe programmers looking for travel information ;) but not researching for (usually) work related stuff. My HTF post got over 3k hits in 2 days. I really can't tell for sure, but I don't think there was a <i>single</i> click on my ads. Maybe one click, actually. The situation is worsened because the hn crowd is not simple programmers, we live and breath the net. So we're ad blind. The poor guy coding Java on a consulting gig on a branch of a financial firm, while he is more ad-blind than soccer moms, it's not something you can base your income (at least not only Adsense).<p>Now, I didn't optimize my ad placement, so I could do better. But from a ~0.70% CTR on my main domain to almost <i>zero</i>... that's quite a lot.<p>Of course, while programmers are generally ad-blind, it all depends. For example, selling .NET books on a .NET oriented website works...<p>While I agree that looking for a function on transmoggit is fast because of Ajax, people have to know about transmoggit first :) And the truth is, depending on your market and your brand, 60% to 100% of your visitors will come from search engines. Sure, after a while, you'll start to get referrals, but how did the person who linked to you found the page? Using search engines.<p>Don't see SEO as a way to trick the search engines ;) I know there's a lot of bad karma around its practices, but if you think that by applying SEO to your pages, you're just making easier for people to find your content, then you'll be happy to do it.<p>I don't know if you can ask around EA for its website statistics. I am pretty sure you'll see that >75% of its visitors come from search engines, even on obvious cases People type the domain name on search engines, for fsck's sake. Or what could actually just be the domain name if they followed with .com (searching for Youtube to go to... youtube.com).<p>There's actually some very good explanations for this behaviour, for example if I want to see the webpage for the Dead Space game, I don't have to guess if it is deadspace.com, deadspacegame.com, deadspace.ea.com, deadspace.games.ea.com, etc... Typing ""dead space game"" on Google is 100% more effective.<p>I am talking too much :) And I don't want to complicate things further to you. But just make it easier for people to find the webpages :)",1233376067

The database dump is less that 100MB gzipped, so I load it in my development environment every week or so.  That way as I develop I'm verifying (to some extent) the quality of the backup.<p>As a baseline, you should at least restore from your backups occasionally.<p>It helps that I'm familiar with the data -- so after restoring the backup I expect to see games, messages, forum posts, etc that I've just seen in production.<p>I do some more thorough automated tests on the backups less frequently.  App specific things, like replay games and verify results, etc.  This process is more about assuring backward compatibility with the code though.<p>I think verification should ultimately be somewhat app specific.  That said, I'm sure you can find tools to help with verification.",1233375957

459213,comment,458825,458825,0,0,gommm,,,"For languages that have a phonetic alphabet (like georgian, armenian, russian, japanese hiragana and katakana, korean), I found the easiest way is to spend one hour a day practicing for 1 or 2 months and then never ever use an alternative transcription when you could use the native phonetic alphabet (or it will take you that much longuer to really master it).<p>First start by some simple study of each letters pronunciation and use them in simple words and use flash cards to remember.<p>Once you master that I recommend doing some dictation exercise, just listen to a dialogue in the target language and start writing it, it's a great way to improve your speed and fluency in the new alphabet... And fluency in an alphabet is very important to help you with memorization of new word (once you get past the decoding phase, I find it's much quicker to learn new words written in the alphabet)<p>For ideograph (like japanese kanji, chinese hanzi and korean hanja), I find that finding a book that teach you the ethymology of the character helps a lot in learning by giving you context on why the character is used that way and it's also very helpful to help master the differences between same characters used in japanese and in chinese.<p>A good website to read on learning languages (despite the rather cheesy title) is <a href=""http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/e/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/e/index.html</a> The forum discussion is rather interesting...<p>Good luck, and try to visit the country, it's still the quickest way to learn the language",1233375858

459211,comment,459017,459017,0,0,mlinsey,,,"Note that this article compares the costs of printing <i>all</i> copies of the New York Times to sending only <i>subscribers</i> free Kindles.<p>I started this post expecting to explain how this made the NYT's printing costs sound a bit more reasonable. Then I found that according to Wikipedia, which cites a 2007 release by the paper itself, the daily circulation of the New York Times is 1,000,665 Daily and 1,438,585 on Sundays.  I am honestly quite surprised that the number of papers sold at newsstands and vending machines is therefore under 200K on weekdays. Using these figures and building off of SAI's estimates, the cost of printing copies just for subscribers is probably about $503 million, or still enough for just under 1.7 kindles per subscriber.<p>Note also that neither bandwidth costs nor the costs of delivering papers is counted. I presume factoring this in would make the print newspaper look even worse.",1233375332

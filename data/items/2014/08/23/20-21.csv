8216847,comment,8216589,8216589,1,0,soneca,,,"I think you should focus on changes that will provide bigger gains. From joncalhoun comment I heavily endorse the retargeting sugestion, but I don&#x27;t think you should worry so much about AB test for now. AB test depends on some heavy and constant traffic and a more predictable knowledge of your audience behavior. I think you are too early on it to gain a lot from AB testing.<p>Another sugestion is assortment and marketing. I think you already have very good channels and niche, but you might exepriment a little more.<p>Please, read all this presentation: <a href=""http://www.heavybit.com/library/video/2013-07-16-michael-dearing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heavybit.com/library/video/2013-07-16-michael-dea...</a><p>For example, i would suggest you try the market for your product for imternational students. Exchange might need the exact same product, but you will have to validate it and validate the channels for it. This is an example of assortment, but you should really see the video above and develop your own ideas about to find new markets and scale a little more.<p>And from what I could see you are doing great. Very well done validation, distribution and website. I predict a lot of success for you.",1408827422

It spreads only through intimate contact with infected body fluids; to avoid Ebola, just refrain from touching sweat, blood or the bodies of the sick or dead.&quot;</i><p>Oh, is that all? Just <i>refrain from touching people?</i> Because last time I checked, we touch people <i>all the damned time</i>, usually without being very aware of it. Easy experiment that will warp your perspective: try to go through an entire day without touching someone, or (harder still) touching something that someone has recently touched. Then track the number of times you accidentally touch something or someone, and later touch your face.<p>There&#x27;s a somewhat alarming bit of Comforting Conventional Wisdom floating around the western media that we&#x27;re totally safe from this because our hospitals are better than in western Africa (true, and yet hospital-acquired infections are incredibly common), or because we have better public health infrastructure (true, and yet we routinely have large outbreaks of rare diseases <i>for which vaccines exist</i>) -- but it&#x27;s absolutely delusional to think that we&#x27;re safe because a virus can only be contracted via human contact.

In fact, most of the screen appears to contain nothing useful.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why the major popular editors all fill the screen with text, and it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve discovered from years of editing code: nothing is more important to programmer productivity than being able to pack a lot of code on the screen at once. There is probably an upper bound to this, but I suspect it is higher than available space on my desk to put monitors in.<p>You don&#x27;t really need annotations and graphics and dotted lines to show you how things relate.

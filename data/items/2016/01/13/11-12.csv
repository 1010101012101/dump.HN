A lot (not all, but a lot) of IOT is solutions in search of a problem, promoted by a tech industry that sees the adoption curve of existing tech reaching saturation.<p>The tragedy is that so much of the innovation we saw over the last 30 years came from the openness of the PC platform: hardware and software could innovate independently, and there was no software &quot;veto&quot; by a platform holder.<p>But that model doesn&#x27;t allow for monopoly profits, so everyone&#x27;s trying to build locked incompatible platforms.",1452686345

Basic arithmetics occupy the &quot;hot path&quot; of your math curriculum until at least high school or beyond. This has a huge influence on reducing the amount of information you need to temporarily hold in your brain at once, leaving room for more important calculations such as exploring the solution space creatively, where one extra piece of information can make or break an insight.<p>Similarly, you can certainly look up a frequently used word in the dictionary every time if you need to. But you might as well memorize the definition once and for all. Now it&#x27;s a question of where to draw the line. For creative professions such as math/engineering/art, I&#x27;d definitely prefer hard-coding some calculations in my brain for the previously mentioned reason.",1452686291

Since we have gone through a bunch of reductions and reorganizations, this ends up meaning that often one person is responsible. Our customer is a 24/7/365 operational unit, and it is our only customer.<p>So, the end result is any given developer is on call all the time, with no pay compensation for that at all. Not only that, but you should expect to be called about not only a defect, but in cases where the customer is trying to use our software in a way it was never designed to be used. So, get a call at 2 AM on the weekend and design and implement a new feature, release to production to debug and test.<p>I really dislike the way we operate, and recently the entire QA team was let go so I have a feeling things are only going to get worse.",1452686288

It&#x27;s simply nonsense - the kind of thing someone clever writes when they&#x27;re discussing a subject completely outside their area of competence.<p>CS can be a craft. It&#x27;s not one of the arts, not even if it&#x27;s beautifully put together, because the arts are not primarily about technique - they&#x27;re about capturing and distilling human experiences using allusions and associations to (re)create those experiences. Fluent technique is a useful tool that help with that, but it&#x27;s not the point.<p>(Modern art is a bit more limited than that, but that&#x27;s more or less what art meant for most of Western history.)<p>The experiences created by the most timeless art are focused, but also ambiguous and complicated. You can get lost in them, and although there&#x27;s often a clear theme, you can&#x27;t define the rest of what&#x27;s happening with absolute final precision.<p>That&#x27;s almost exactly the opposite of what good code does. Which is why &quot;That&#x27;s a clever, clean solution&quot; is an experience that exists in the craftsman&#x27;s world, and is either peripheral or completely absent from an artist&#x27;s view.<p>>I think dropping &quot;science&quot; from &quot;Computer Science&quot; would help immeasurably.<p>At my university the joke was always that it should be called &quot;Computer Studies.&quot; Only a nugget of algorithmic research is genuinely scientific, and that lives in a tiny corner of the rest of the Pure Math. There could be a lot more formal provability, but going down that route would put a lot of programmers out of work, because the level of difficulty is much higher than that needed to crank out some JavaScript.<p>What&#x27;s left is usually neither rigorous nor beautiful.",1452686101

This is the main selling point of Clojurescript which, while I enjoy Clojure a lot, is a dynamically typed language like JS itself, and I wish I could interact with JS in a stricter way. If Elm can improve on its interop, it has potential to be a strong force. But this is true of any new language. If you can&#x27;t easily interop with the lowest common denominator language in the platform you build for, your language is too restricted for meaningful use. This is why Rust integrates well with C, because it has to, or it is irrelevant in many cases. This is why Clojure interops seamlessly with Java. Elm needs to get this point, or it will remain a niche hobby language avoided by professionals.",1452685833

An an example, it is common to see the following:<p><pre><code>    if not file_exists(filepath):\n        stderr(&quot;Invalid config filepath!&quot;)\n\n    config = read_file(filepath)\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nThis code has the glaring problem that even if the file <i>exists</i>, that doesn&#x27;t mean you have the required permissions to read it. What you really want to do is read the config file, but you check a proxy (does the file exist at all?) as your precondition.<p>How would you check for the right thing, that you can read the config file? Well, by trying to read the config file, of course!<p><pre><code>    try:\n        config = read_file(filepath)\n    except IOError:  # can make this more fine-grained\n        stderr(&quot;Invalid config filepath!&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nThis is longer code (one extra line, gasp!) but it avoids the problem of checking the wrong precondition which is so easy to do by mistake.<p>You may have heard of this concept in a different situation – e-mail validation. A lot of people go to great lengths to validate e-mail addresses by regex. Even if the address is perfectly conforming and passes the regex with flying colours it might not lead to an inbox. To really verify that the user can receive e-mail at the address they&#x27;ve specified, guess what you have to do? Send an e-mail and ask them to confirm they got it.

I&#x27;ve worked at places that do have on-call rotations and others that have none. I will no longer work at a company that requires me to be on-call.<p>Why? It says a lot when a company doesn&#x27;t put the effort into various forms of testing and QA to ensure that production software does not have critical issues that warrant at 2am call. Unit, functional, integration, load, and simulation tests should be written for every single piece of critical infrastructure. You should be hammering these things in staging environments with 10-100x of your normal peak load.Use something like Gore to replay live traffic against a version in staging or QA environments. Yes, that takes work, but to me it&#x27;s better upfront than to wake me up in the middle of the night or to know that when I go home I have to have my phone around me at all times. The business should care about these things too; it&#x27;s their product and they should care enough about you to make sure good processes are in place to ensure quality production software.<p>That said, when I was at non-on-call companies there are definitely times when something does happen that warrants immediate attention. Generally someone in operations would get the first call, they check logs, diagnose the issue, and call a developer familiar with the app that&#x27;s causing the issues if that&#x27;s the case. I don&#x27;t mind waking up because I know it has to be something serious that slipped past our processes.",1452685558

This sort of argument is common, but not one that seems to be supported by evidence.<p>For one thing, arbitrary limits are rarely a good idea in programming. If I take an 18 line Java function and translate it almost directly into Python, where it’s only 14 lines because I don’t need a few closing braces, is it suddenly now more maintainable? That seems unlikely.<p>More significantly in this particular case, various studies over the years have <i>not</i> supported the claim that short functions have better error rates, nor that longer but otherwise reasonable functions have higher error rates; if anything, the overall body of evidence seems to suggest the opposite conclusion.[1]<p>As the book does note itself, the problem with longer functions often isn’t their length, it’s that they are mixing up multiple responsibilities, which can’t then be read, tested, or reused separately. A better guideline here might have been to separate different responsibilities into different functions, rather than focus on the amount of code required to implement a specific responsibility cleanly. Of course, this will naturally lead to shorter functions in a lot of cases, but without the correlation/causation fallacy.<p>For similar reasons, I wish they had treated their second substantial example (the one about the Pacman-style game board) differently. There are a few maintenance hazards with the original code that perhaps could be improved, and depending on the rest of the code there might be some useful ways to refactor that function for ease of reuse. However, the original function wasn’t awful, and it was reasonably clear what it did and how it worked. I don’t think it is an improvement to replace that with three functions and a substantial amount of shared state wrapped in a class. The code is still tightly coupled, so this offers limited benefits in terms of testing or reuse, and now the reader has to jump around different parts of almost twice as much code to figure out what is going on.<p>To add insult to injury, there is then a horrible section on common objections that tries to address the criticism that more spread out code may be harder to read. I imagine my psychologist friends would cringe at the way it appeals without evidence to probably one of the most misunderstood results in all of psychology.<p>I haven’t read the whole book, but the subsequent chapters that I have read do follow a similar pattern, in particular dismissing potential objections to the authors’ preferred style with vague arguments that lack either logical reasoning or citations of hard data. From authors who apparently have CS PhDs and talk a lot about science and software quality in their biographies, this lack of rigour is disappointing.<p>I applaud the authors for trying to raise awareness of an important and often neglected aspect of programming, but unfortunately this book looks like a missed opportunity: it’s more <i>Clean Code</i> than <i>Code Complete</i>, strong on advocacy but light on evidence and with some questionable advice.<p>[1] For anyone who wants to explore real data in this area, I suggest starting with the discussion in <i>Code Complete</i>, which helpfully cites several relevant papers from the relatively early research, and then using Google Scholar to find more recent material based on what else cites those papers.",1452685080

Nothing is more frustrating than spending the first afternoon trying to get dev tools setup and having to ask questions all the time.<p>Setting up the virtual machines, cloning all the right repositories required, figuring out configs etc ending with instructions on how to run full test suite.

I love when a senior developer can spend some time pair-programming with me through a few simple bugs in different places on the code base.

Moore's Law has multiplied computing power by a factor of roughly a million over 30 years.  In most of the industry, that capacity has been eaten up by productivity enhancements.  We have CPU cycles to burn, so we burn them in interpreted languages like Python and Ruby and IDEs like Eclipse, for some marginal increase in productivity.<p>Google chose to burn them by processing larger and larger data sets, instead.  And there're certain emergent phenomena that occur as the data set gets bigger.  Almost nothing in search or ads would work with the data available at desktop-scale.<p>The interesting thing is that by pushing on data size instead of productivity, Google's had to find other ways to scale productivity and the number of engineers in the organization.  I've mentioned some of the public ones in a previous comment (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1101443"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1101443</a>); there're some others that I don't think I can talk about.  But I find this whole notion of where you allocate resources fascinating.  There's this conventional wisdom of always putting them into developer productivity, but Google's succeeded because they <i>sometimes</i> (judiciously) choose to move them into processing more data and find other ways to work around the productivity hit that entails.",1265367094

At what point are they going to just use a standard JavaVM? The two main theories are A) that it was a licensing dodge because (like Adobe Flash did till recently) Sun gave Java away on the desktop and charged for mobile and set-top boxes, or B) it was necessary to get performance on low power hardware.<p>I didn't believe the latter reason at the time, and it's only getting less true as phones get better processors and people talk about putting it on tablets and netbooks.

It is understandable that Techcrunch is attempting to cover their own ass in terms of journalistic integrity but the fact that the individual at hand was a minor complicates the situation.  When Arrington writes in ""An Apology To Our Readers"", anyone who is even remotely familiar with Techcrunch can deduce who screwed up from the information provided.<p>Yes, Daniel made a lapse in judgement, but being a minor (and clearly are hard and dedicated worker) he should have at least been given the opportunity to let this go down silently.  When a minor gets into some trouble before they are 18, typically their record is wiped clean as they enter adulthood.  Sadly, this is a permanent public record and could prevent him from getting hired or having a career in journalism again (whether thats deserved or not is up in the air).<p>As an intern, should he have been given so much responsibilty? Who knows really, it just kind of feels like they took advantage of Daniel and threw him to the wayside when he first faultered. Clearly that much spotlight and attention for someone that young might have been too much (at least without some protectionary measures). Losing his intern position and having to deal with that personally and with his family should have been punishment enough.  If he wanted to make that a public issue, he should have at least gotten the choice.  Instead he was forced publicly to disclose what happened to the world and might have to live with that small error in judgement his whole life.

Within hours of this attack, we were in contact with federal law enforcement and the affected parties. This attack hijacked the DNS traffic of 4 domains for a very short period of time before we mitigated the situation.<p>You have not been impacted by this incident and you are not required to take any action to ensure your future security. However, in an effort to continue to strive for transparency and best in class services, I wanted to inform you of this unfortunate situation.<p>To be clear, no domain names were stolen, and after exhaustive analysis, with the exception of the DNS of the domains specifically targeted, we do not have any evidence or reason to believe that these malicious actors accessed any customer accounts, customer personal information, or any of Enom’s secured and encrypted data. Your security is a leading priority at Enom and we continue to work both with federal law enforcement and industry leading security forensic companies to protect your online presence.<p>I know you trust Enom with your domain names and services and we take this responsibility very seriously.

The average bus rider in my small experience (not talking about the actual average, that I do not know) is typically Spanish speaking, is crazy drugged out/drunk, or will not care no matter how much you try to reason with them. I kid you not, I have seen on more than one occasion a homeless person heave feces at the buses that pass them by when they are too full to legally allow more people on. Maybe not most, but enough of the population of passengers are too nuts to reason with that trying to enforce a disembark only policy will lead to deaths of drivers (not that the drivers are all that different than passengers either, you cannot believe that <i>some</i> are considered qualified to drive by any rational person).

9580374,comment,9578462,9578462,0,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> It’s this shift to processed foods, taking place all over the world, that’s contributing to a rising epidemic of obesity and related diseases. If most of the world ate more local fruits and vegetables, a little meat, fish, and some whole grains (as in the highly touted Mediterranean diet), and exercised an hour a day, that would be good news for our health—and for the planet.<p>I believe this is accurate, but the cynic in me says the obvious solutions by in large aren&#x27;t going to be adopted.<p>1. The idea that a balanced diet that largely avoids processed foods is likely to be most healthy is logical, but it&#x27;s not very sexy. More extreme Diets (note the captial &quot;D&quot;) gain mainstream popularity because they are usually based on a seemingly compelling narrative. Paleo, while hardly the worst Diet that has been popularized in the last decade, is a good example of this.<p>2. The reality is that most people aren&#x27;t going to exercise an hour a day <i>and</i> maintain a healthy diet[1]. There&#x27;s also the issue of how the average person exercises. While I wouldn&#x27;t suggest that everybody jump into HIIT or train like a professional athlete, a lot of what you see in a typical big box gym is the fitness world&#x27;s equivalent of processed foods: people aren&#x27;t getting a whole lot out of what they&#x27;re doing. There&#x27;s not enough intensity, far too much emphasis is placed on isolated/non-functional exercises, etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/15/take-off-that-fitbit-exercise-alone-wont-make-you-lose-weight/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/15/t...</a>",1432169555

We don&#x27;t have 100% test coverage (I don&#x27;t know anyone who does). So there will be stuff breaking. With hundreds of thousands of lines of Python code, the testing/fixing burden would be enormous. It just doesn&#x27;t make business sense to move.\nThis codebase will never be on Python3. And I think it would be a serious mistake even if it could be done, as the Python3 &quot;migration&quot; isn&#x27;t done, until it&#x27;s actually happened. Right now the numbers I&#x27;ve seen are that 10-20% of the Python userbase is on 3.x. The future for Python3 is sketchy at best, those support dates are nothing more than political propaganda. If they meant something, they wouldn&#x27;t have already pushed it back to 2020. Even if it did matter, code doesn&#x27;t just stop working when the ball drops in 2020.<p>So if I could snap my fingers and port us over to 3, and have no breakage (which would cost us millions if not sink the entire business)- I still wouldn&#x27;t do it. The best strategy is keep on using Python2, which with ~80% of the userbase still at this point in 2015. Python 3.0 was released late 2008. It would be a mistake to switch even if it were risk-free.<p>We will be using Python2, and bringing Go in-house for new components where we would have used Python3 in an alternate universe where the migration wasn&#x27;t botched by the CPython core dev team.",1432169421

The actual <i>publication</i> of that to peers is much quicker, and said publication is usually when a retailer would interpret a payment as having been &quot;received&quot;.<p>The only way to speed this up further - with either fiat or cryptographic currency - is to distribute it physically.  In the case of fiat, this would be cash.  In the case of cryptographic, this would be a paper wallet with a verifiable balance and totally-secret private key, not known to even the person who&#x27;s paying with it (which is feasible, hypothetically, by using a machine that could print paper wallets with the private key obscured by &quot;scratcher&quot; film like what lottery tickets use; said machine, however, would need to be entirely disconnected from any form of telecommunications, generate truly-(pseudo)random (i.e. not pregenerated) keys, and have no means of storing keys on non-volatile memory in order to be trustworthy, however, but all three of these things are possible with today&#x27;s technology by not including a NIC, using a PNRG (in software or hardware), and using ROM and a RAMdisk exclusively, respectively).

There&#x27;s a tendency to assume the various Yemeni factions are puppets being controlled by Iran, the Saudis, the US and so on, but in practice the local factions are very adept at manipulating their various sponsors.  The important divisions in Yemen are regional (north, south, and Aden) and tribal, and the tragedy of the country is that it is trying to stitch together very dissimilar regions while outside powers work hard to destabilize it.<p>With regard to al-Qaeda specifically, the Yemeni branch has always been quite distinct.  Bin Laden has deep ties to Yemen, which ironically has made AQAP even more of a tribal, regional force, since unlike Afghanistan it&#x27;s a bunch of locals.<p>I think it&#x27;s good to remember that southern Yemen used to be a highly ideological, Marxist state(!). The fact that all these Marxists have vanished without a trace suggests how hard it is for any transnational ideology to gain a foothold in this deeply conservative, tenacious country.",1432166773

I actually see an opportunity for a C-compatible or C-competitive systems language here to beat C++ at its own game. Zero-cost abstractions plus solving C++&#x27;s specific problems, painless C FFI, and compilation to C (or LLVM) to leverage their compilers. Might make a nice combo. I doubt we&#x27;ll see much takeup, though, as the technical merits rarely dictate that.<p>On a related note, I&#x27;d like to see the results of it being coded in a modern Ada or SPARK with one of the best compilers. I&#x27;d be interested in seeing it with full runtime checks on and off with conservative optimization. ZeroMQ with strong implementation assurance could lay the foundation for all kinds of secure networking and middleware schemes.

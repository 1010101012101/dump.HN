My employer has me rate my team members on a scale from 1 to 6 on a variety of work related criteria. The basis for getting a raise rests on the employees ability to increase their ratings on a review to review period. It's horrible (and I've told them I think so).<p>The entire ratings system is ripe to be exploited by people who know how to play the game. <i>This is especially bad if non-technical people are reviewing technical people.</i> I had to witness the worst developer on my team become the highest paid because he knew how to sell himself and could speak a language that upper management understood.<p>I'm more in favor of (arguably) less subjective methods of determining an employees worth (like Bioware's RPG style ratings, or Joel Spolsky's ladder). There's still room for person bias, but at least there's <i>less</i> room.",1242925106

I think the correct way it should have been presented is that performance reviews should be done in a more useful way. Not all performance reviews are for the purpose of rationalizing bonuses. I think feedback on one's performance accompanied with goal setting of specific behaviors is fundamental in sustaining good work and motivation in employees.<p>I do think that ranking employees doesn't work most of the time because it not only creates competition but discourages those who have been performing well, but just not so much as others who could potentially be ass-kissers as what the article says.<p>The bottom line is that , w/o a review/feedback on your on-going performance, you wouldn't have an idea of what you should work towards to and u cant assume that all employees are intrinsically motivated to do better.<p>Heuristically, people lose their sense of engagement about 5 months after they are hired and this can keep deteriorating if immediate supervisors don't provide the support/encouragement/feedback.<p>One last thing, research has repeatedly shown that regular performance feedback increases motivation and performance in the long-run. what's important really is how the feedback is given.",1242925055

This kind of argument has been going on for a while though, about how we defer attention to distant people, like answering the phone when you're already conversing with someone else, or texting under the dinner table.  I've ranted about that kind of thing myself a couple times; it annoys me. (I'm ~30).<p>But outside of business settings, it really a <i>problem</i>?  I don't know that we can really say that in social settings it's necessarily <i>better</i> to be unplugged.

In fact, it can be pretty good as long as we always remember:<p>- We were born at a time to now have the best of multiple worlds: modern technology, good work experience, and some domain-specific knowledge.<p>- No matter what the sitution, the ability to drill down > 1 level is a great personal differentiator.  I love being a hacker.<p>- In large institutions, illogical is the new logical.<p>- It's OK to be a fish out of water, as long as you realize that you're a fish out of water.<p>- Always find the ""takeaway"" from a bad situation.<p>- There are a whole bunch of things we probably can't change (Ex: everybody being plugged in).  The trick is determining what to do with that data.<p>- Positive mental attitude trumps all.  When things don't make sense, always think, ""What <i>can</i> I do about that?""

Then I press you for reasons. E.g., why would you write your web app in C++?<p>edit: Note that someone who is genuinely very close to me in opinions won't challenge me in ways that really produce a useful diversity of opinion. They would, however, likely agree with my sense of strategy and tactics; this might lead to a collective blindspot where a deeper problem is overlooked.

4850236,comment,4848974,4850012,9,0,rayiner,,,"Flaws like this arise from trying to be too clever with syntax. Function application with parentheses, literal regular expressions without clear delimiters, etc. Syntax should be describable in a handful of universal rules. Lisp is the extreme in this regard, the rule is simply: parentheses nest properly. But you can build surprisingly rich syntax with a simple set of rules so long as you lay out those rules first and conform the syntax to them as you go.",1354222790

It has a built in assumption that the candidate wants the job and is trying to convince the company that they are the right person. Thus, interview processes are usually about evaluating the candidate.<p>Candidate evaluation and filtering is necessary. There are a lot of people out there trying to get hired who are lying and faking their skills. See the people who can't do fizzbuzz. However, the overall situation is that demand for these technical skills far exceeds the supply. That means that when someone passes through your filters, you need to severely limit your evaluation of them. Instead, you need to sell them. The talent has the upper hand. They probably already have a job, and can get one anywhere. If you want them to work for you, you need to be in sales mode, not interview mode.",1354222651

Even if you don't have children, by simply starting a business where you employ many people, you're essentially providing a means to life for others. If your business is successful, you will have brought life to others via work for possibly generations(which essentially means others can provide a life for themselves and their families). I know that's a bit of a reach, but it's probably true to a small extent, at least in first world countries. Hundreds of years ago, I completely agree with you.<p>We live in a world where your work can potentially impact billions of people.

The individual letters jump up and down 2-3 px. Perhaps a Fontsquirrel issue?<p>- The social media buttons hug the browser toolbar. In some browsers there is just a few pixels between clicking Tweet and clicking a bookmark.<p>- Add alt-attributes to all images, empty if decorative. Specifying width and height will help with rendering or when the images won't load.<p>- Test your site with noscript. The fall-back font isn't sized properly and lacks enough line-height, so sentences overlap and lay-out breaks.<p>- Did you forget to style your footer? It uses the browser standard Times New Roman font for me.<p>- Declare (UTF-8) charset at the document level.<p>- <a name=""foo""> for internal anchors is obsolete.<p>- Add spacing between links and words: ""$129<span>Buy It</span>"" or else without styling or for screenreaders it will read: ""$129Buy it""<p>- If you want to support older browsers lack of PNG alpha support, simply bake your PNG's with the website background, convert to 8-bit or add PNG alpha support with javascript or .htc<p>- Specify canonical or make sure your site serves only one unique page per URL: non-www and www redirects, remove or add trailing slashes, ""index"" added to the URL's or without, use lowercase in your URL's (both uppercase and lowercase letters return the same page). A combination of the above can result in 256+ different URL's returning the same page.<p>- Encode spaces or replace them with dashes, for example when linking to your sample chapter PDF.<p>- <a href=""http://www.crossbrowserbook.com/Knowledge/index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crossbrowserbook.com/Knowledge/index</a> renders differently in different browsers (whitespace near the end). It also lacks a header or footer, so no way to return: visitor trap. On that page a spelling error ""startet"".<p>- Consider using summary, <thead> and <tbody> for relational tables, like the browsersupport tables. No alt-attribute on the browser logo's makes this table unusable for the vision impaired.<p>- Facebook button is in German.<p>- Study your pagetitles and see if you can target them more. Consider adding the site title. Consider adding a meta description. Consider adding a sample chapter as HTML content to the website. Consider supporting Chrome Frame and future versions of IE (<meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""IE=Edge,chrome=1"" />).",1354222147

Like how lawyers have to specify that they're not giving legal advice. and how it's 'best practice' in auto-journalism to disclose when a manufacturer has provided you with perks while 'reviewing' their vehicle.  I'd like to see 'analysis' which carries a similar disclaimer,  Has a long position in Microsoft, in the original article.  Not a link to it. that way no one can copy the press release and miss 'the only important point of the article' which as you say is linked.",1354219531

There's not firefox or OS support for making that kind of thing doable. You'd want to have some sort of OS and app support for being able to encrypt a message in a widget on a GUI layer above the browser and then transferring it in, so that PGP and Firefox never come into direct contact. Qubes OS has a rough mechanism for keeping different security-level apps separated, and identified via a colored window border. I wonder if something similar to this is the correct solution.",1354219503

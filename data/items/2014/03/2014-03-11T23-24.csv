In traditional 2D games, being able to see things that are not visible to the player&#x27;s avatar is, IMO, a significant part of the charm.

Or, for that matter, most elections of any kind. But if you are changing from plurality, approval is about the <i>worst</i> change you could make other than ones that could only be deliberately malicious (e.g., modifying plurality to elect the candidate with the <i>lowest</i> number of first place preference votes.)<p>> Considering just the theoretical benefits and drawbacks in this context, I would agree with a preference for ranked methods. However, when we consider the complexity (and resulting decrease in transparency) I&#x27;ve come to prefer approval.<p>I personally have no problem with democracy requiring expecting citizens to deal with concepts more complex than approval voting, since, actually, most of the things they are <i>voting on</i> are things more complex than approval voting.",1394581729

As always, you adjust for the problem at hand. Royce, the so-called inventor of waterfall (he presented it as an obviously flawed concept, a straw man), argued for copious documentation. Documentation makes a lot of sense when trying to built a jet-liner, and is often a time and money sink if you are trying to write, say, research code for computer vision.<p>So, &quot;revolutionary&quot;? I dunno? Certainly many places had taken the deliberately flawed Royce model as the way to do things, and so there was a big change as far as that goes. But I can&#x27;t recall a time where some form of iterative/evolutionary development method was not known about and practiced, or where decision making was favored over process.<p>To make this clearer - the Royce-ers patted themselves on the back, and then got hopelessly entangled with process. Yourdon came along. Wow, was that a great process - which everyone got entangled with. Then there was Booch.....  And now, we have Agile.

The following is a succinct explanation from a 3 second Google search on the issue.<p>&quot;There are two major reasons for Delaware&#x27;s dominance of the corporate incorporation business. One reason is the bi-partisan political consensus in Delaware to keep the Delaware corporation statute modern and up-to-date, and to rely on Delaware&#x27;s corporate law specialists for advice in how to do this. As a result, law students at every law school in the United States study the Delaware corporation statute and the decisions of Delaware courts interpreting that law.&quot;<p>&quot;The other major reason corporations choose to incorporate in Delaware is the quality of Delaware courts and judges. Delaware has a special court, the Court of Chancery, to rule on corporate law disputes without juries. Corporate cases do not get stuck on dockets behind the multitude of non-corporate cases.

Node + Express or Hapi or whatever as a web development framework<p>The recommendations in this article work well if you&#x27;re targeting Node as a scripting language.<p>However, if you are developing using a web framework, then some of the recommendations are too lean (IMO).<p>1. npm init<p>When I&#x27;m developing for the web, I use a more robust application skeleton. There are a ton to choose from. However, I do use npm init when developing scripts. My guess is the author&#x27;s point is something like, &quot;good Node devs include a package.json&quot;.<p>2. Declare all dependencies<p>Absolutely. Works for both web and scripts.<p>3. Specify a start script<p>Yes, for scripts.<p>However for the web task runners such as Grunt / Gulp / etc. work better. For web dev starting the server is just one task of many. For example, if you need to start the server after checking the environment, watch for file changes, run jslint/jshint, and so on then a task runner makes web development easier.<p>4. Specify a test script<p>Yes!<p>5. Keep dependencies out of source control<p>Yes, but use npm-shrinkwrap because the code you deploy (your code + deps) should be the <i></i>exact same code<i></i> that you ran during testing.<p>6. Use environment variables to configure npm<p>Absolutely. Config files are another option, but this is a matter of personal preference. The authors point is totally valid.<p>7. Bring your own npm registry<p>This is an interesting one and one where there is no clear &quot;best choice&quot; yet. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how npm (public and private) evolve.<p>8. Keep track of outdated dependencies<p>Yup<p>9. Use npm scripts to run custom build steps<p>This is now being debated. There are some in the community who specifically prevent pre/post scripts from running automatically when installing via npm.<p>10. Try new things<p>Debatable (at this time). These new features can also go onto the todo list in the near future. If someone is new to node, they <i></i>may<i></i> be better served by focusing on what node / JS does now.<p>11. Browserify<p>Depends. If you&#x27;re using Angular, then it has its own module system. I think Ember has its own module system as well.<p>require.js is another option.

Setting aside the money issue (its really a _visibility_ issue rather than a money issue) there is a certain amount of support that is needed by voter influencing groups. Well known vote influencers are Unions, Churches, and Civic groups such as the Rotary club. Additionally if you&#x27;re running as a member of a party, that party should nominally know you exist (they will be asked questions).<p>The idea that you can get elected just by direct influence of the citizens is not well founded. :-). So when I was doing this and got more serious (I had permission from Google for a 2 year leave of absence if elected) I talked with some political consultants, and their input was that like jobs, politicians have a resume and a &#x27;trail&#x27; which is to say they do simpler, smaller, roles and the people around them develop a notion of what it is like to work with them. It is <i>that</i> credibility that allows people to believe you can serve them if you are elected. So if you want to run for congress, you should ideally get a job that exposes you to the politicos in your area so they are at least somewhat aware of your existence. That also shows that you can do the scut work of being a politician, and for any job above a certain level of influence (city supervisor, county supervisor) it will inform on how you can be influenced.<p>Easier to launch a run for the Senate as the former Mayor of San Francisco for example, than it is to launch it as &quot;Oh hey, I can do this!

7382828,comment,7372997,7372997,1,0,dcgibbons,,,"I am 43 and I have been programming professionally for the past 26 years.<p>I had good early education, but left school as a college freshman to focus on industry work, and didn&#x27;t return until 2004. The lack of formal education has never held me back, as technology companies especially like people who have been successful without those credentials. I am doing a graduate program in CS now, for the pure intellectual fun of it.<p>Pay has continued steadily over my career, with the only setbacks being self-imposed when I tried my own startups or left a high paying job for a lesser one because of better long-term prospects. It is mentally hard deciding to leave those $200k+/year jobs, but I have not once regretted it. In the end, I have only had 2 years total in my career where my taxable gross was less than the year before, and one of those years is when I took a year off to goof off (as an aside, I highly recommend that people do this every 5 years or so).<p>I have always wondered about ageism, mostly because I started doing this when I was 18 and there were a lot of older developers I worked with that were not effective. I have come to learn over time that age has really little to do with this: people can become complacent for a variety of reasons, and age has little to do with it.<p>The few folks I&#x27;ve known that are older and who did have trouble finding jobs had some other life issues in the way, such as letting their skills become irrelevant, being a bitter whiner, or not being a very good salesperson. You don&#x27;t have to be the smartest tool in the shed to interview well, and sometimes you will not (I have had some spectacular uhhhh-duh moments more than once!), but take those setbacks as opportunities to learn and improve, not to sit and complain.<p>The whole discussion on management, leadership, architecture, etc. is quite pertinent. I have done mostly architecture since my early 20s and always find myself back in that role whether or fight it or not. I try very hard to code every single day, but the reality is businesses get more value from me when I am looking at the bigger picture and enabling others to code faster. Personally, I would much rather go code than do that type of work, but it is still very fulfilling and is still engineering.<p>When I give others career advice and coaching, my number 1 suggestion is to always do what you love, but be open-minded about what that means. Most of us will find ourselves with a variety of opportunities over the years and being self-limiting is the best way to keep your career from advancing.<p>My number 2 suggestion on career is that if find yourself being the smartest person in your company, either because you are or just believe it, it is time to move on. Don&#x27;t be that guy/girl.<p>I have always deliberately avoided the siren-song of the Valley, but I know I could make enough compensation to make up for the cost of living differences and still support my family well there. But, I will only go there if the project/company is one where I will be making a substantial impact on something interesting. And, frankly, that really should be true for anyone with more than 20 years of experience: it is time to use your experience for great works, not just paying the bills.<p>p.s. rules of thumbs are just that, and sometimes you have to make compromises because life is in the way - that&#x27;s okay, too. Just don&#x27;t let yourself fall into a trap/rut because of those.<p>p.p.s. people in this field are rich by almost every measure, even if you aren&#x27;t technically still in the 1%. If you&#x27;re struggling to get by in the Bay Area, there are a lot better places to live where you can do a lot better. Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking that is the only place to be.<p>p.p.p.s. get off my lawn",1394579229
7382827,comment,7379534,7382317,3,0,gamblor956,,,"A good number of politicians already have &quot;startup cred,&quot; having launched their own businesses prior to going into politics.  Many successful businessmen used their financial success to launch political careers.  Examples include the notorious Darrel Issa; nearly every Midwestern doctors-turned-politician, and most lawyers-turned-politician.<p>Indeed, the tech concept of &quot;startup cred&quot; is essentially meaningless.  It means you know how to launch a company and perhaps sell the company but says nothing about your ability to make it profitable or to maintain its profitability. When you&#x27;re running a government, you can&#x27;t just sell it or bail--you have to keep going.  In this regard, many voters could even view serial startup experience as a negative.",1394579216

You, with your work, are not forcing anyone. We live in a world full of possibilities, the problem here is, to be able to critically analyze what you do, otherwise there is no thing that can save you, you&#x27;ll misuse even the simpler things to cause yourself some kind of problems.<p>There is more, even controversial things have some very good impact on the life of people making judicious use of those things. Example: a violent game can be a way to express violence of an otherwise repressed person, or some other people that is having a few bad weeks, is finding an escape playing at it. Similarly alcool, that if abused can be bad, addicting, and destroy people, is the joy of many people having a glass of wine from time to time, and so forth.<p>Most of the times the problem is not the tool but the user.",1394579135

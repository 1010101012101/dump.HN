I certainly have wanted a private heroku that is not a bear to install.<p>In my ideal world, you could start with a single machine on say Digital Ocean for $5/mo. and that machine could host any number of apps, heroku style, for me until it runs out of resources. It should then be easy to move apps to a 2nd or 3rd or whatever server if I chose not to just bump up the resources on that first one. If an app needs to run multiple servers, it should handle that as well. Having reasonably fine grained control on how many machines things like a database or memcache layer was on would be nice.<p>In short, I would like something like heroku without all the extra costs of heroku. Cloud 66 comes reasonably close, but I&#x27;d like to not pay the extra service overhead. I&#x27;d rather just pay for the infrastructure. Something open source that handles this in a reasonable way would be great, but I don&#x27;t know that Deis is going to be the answer.",1382640607

Non-constant polynomials always eventually blow up away from 0, so in differentiating, you&#x27;re multiplying a function by something that blows up, in the frequency domain. This means that, in the result, higher frequencies are going to dominate over lower frequencies, at a polynomial rate.<p>Let me be clear, the problem with numerical differentiation is not just that rounding errors accumulate, it&#x27;s that differentiation is fundamentally unstable, and not something you want to apply to real-world data.<p>It depends very much on what your application is, however, I think generally a better approach to AD is to redefine your differentiation, by composing it with a low-pass filter. If designed properly, your low-pass filter will &#x27;go to zero&#x27; faster (in the frequency-domain) than any polynomial, thus making this new operator bounded, and hence numerically more stable. It&#x27;s not a panacea, but it begins to address the fundamental problem.<p>One example of such a filter is Gamma(n+1, n x^2)/Factorial[n], where Gamma is the incomplete gamma function [3].<p>In Python:<p>scipy.special.gammaincc(n+1,n<i>x</i><i>2)\nor\nmpmath.gammainc(n+1,n</i>x<i></i>2, regularized=True)<p>To see why this is a nice choice, notice item 2 in [4]. This filter is simply the product of exp(- x^2) (the Gaussian) multiplied by the first n-terms of the Taylor series of exp(+ x^2),  (1/ the-Gaussian).  Since this series converges unconditionally everywhere, as n-> +infinity, this filter converges to 1 for  a fixed x (as you increase n), however, since it&#x27;s still a gaussian times  a polynomial, it always converges to 0 as you increase x, but fix n.<p>This is my area of research, so if anyone&#x27;s interested I can give more details.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band-limit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band-limit</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform#Analysis_of_differential_equations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform#Analysis_of_...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_gamma_function"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_gamma_function</a>\n[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_gamma_function#Special_values"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_gamma_function#Spec...</a>",1382640604

I know, I know, ssd&#x27;s come in larger sizes --- but they become significantly more expensive, and most entry-level notebooks (with ssd&#x27;s) come with 128gb.

As such, I think that if there is anything that a normal person might want, it&#x27;s more harddrive space as they fill up their small-ish SSDs --- so that they don&#x27;t need to worry about deleting things when they have too many pictures, games, etc. The average person won&#x27;t want chrome to take half the number of milliseconds to open a new tab, or their games to go from 40 fps to 60fps.

The good types include various fiberboards of a tan color, and if you scratch the edge with your fingernail, you should be able to loosen (and observe) individual fibers. I have purchased pre-cut sheets of this material at Home Depot in the US (midwestern and western US). They also sell a type which has a flat wood pattern printed on one side, intended as &quot;wall board&quot;. It is cheap - 12-18USD for a 4x8&#x27; sheet.<p>The type that is used in clipboard backers is NOT good for laser cutting. Although it is also called MDF, it is dark brown, sometimes semi-gloss on the surface, heavier, and more structural. Unfortunately, the glue used to bond and seal it soaks up laser cutting energy and makes it very difficult to cut without significant char.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for small amounts of laserable material for testing, laserbits is not a bad source (<a href=""http://www.laserbits.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=82_352"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.laserbits.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=82_...</a>). However, in general I would recommend finding it locally at a lumberyard or home improvement shop as the quantity and pricing are better, and they will typically also cut it for you for a low price. Another source for this kind of material (at least in the US) are university bookstores, who havea (expensive) supplies for architecture majors.",1382638904

The documentation was fairly straightforward, unlike than the markov chain generator stuff that is passed off as documentation by the AngularJS crew.<p>However, Knockout&#x27;s technique for watching state requires you to wrap everything of interest. The actual model becomes thoroughly comingled with calls to ko.observable( yourVariableOfInterest ), often in multiple places in the call stack when KO fails to follow the flow of execution.<p>And this spreads into your testing too. You can&#x27;t just test your own model in isolation, you have to bring KO along for the ride.<p>I reached a high-water mark and decided to move off Knockout onto something else.<p>AngularJS was shiny and trendy, the tutorial impressive, so foolishly I switched.<p>Angular at least allows me to leave my model code largely unannotated. I recently radically refactored the model code and I only needed small changes on the Angular bits. The Angular method is that you build a mapping between your own model and what Angular knows about. So instead of your <i>own</i> code being comingled with Angular annotations, you have your own code in one place and the Angular mappings in another place (in a Controller with $scope.variableOfInterest = model.yourVariableOfInterest).<p>On the downside, Angular&#x27;s documentation is <i>notoriously terrible</i>. I was at a tech interview last week at a place which uses Angular, and everything about Angular that has stumped me has stumped teams of people who are better than me. And just like me, they spend more time reading the Angular code to explain the docs than relying on the docs.<p>I think that for CRUD apps with swooshiness, Angular is great.

One obvious way is straight-up helping individual inventors or small companies take on big ones. But another less obvious way they help is by creating a secondary market for patents. This has many follow on effects. For one, VCs are more likely to fund startups with the idea that they can partially offset the risk of failure by monetizing the patents (papers by Merges, Mann, etc. to this effect, IIRC). This enables entrepreneurs to pursue riskier technology ventures.<p>Saying they exist only to litigate is missing the whole picture. That is simply what they specialize in, primarily because patents are essentially a right to sue, and there&#x27;s a gap in the market when it comes to enforcing patents.<p>Now you may say that patents themselves are crap and represent no value, but 1) that&#x27;s a different problem than trolls, as others have mentioned, and 2) you&#x27;d be making a generalized assertion with little data to back it up. Even if you are an experienced patent litigator who&#x27;s seen a lot of cases, there are biases at play.

I can have two normal-width source files or other text content side by side comfortably. The keyboard is the classic Thinkpad keyboard with 7 rows and what many people find to be the best feel on a laptop.

It uses Bluetooth 4.0 technology which supposedly has a range of 50-150 feet depending on where you are.  They also seem to have GPS built in, or it craftily uses the GPS coordinates from your phone.  If you&#x27;re out of range, then you&#x27;re out of luck.

6606784,comment,6602899,6603965,2,0,llcoolv,,,"It is very simple - depression is like cancer in a sense that it expands and captures/modifies more and more reflexes, thought patterns, habits and other aspects of personality. The single most important thing is to stop trying to be accommodating and understanding to its effects (feeling sorry for yourself), which is needed in order to increase locus of control[1]. Another key part (which comes later) is to absolutely believe and be determined that you&#x27;re not depressed and that mistakes are just mistakes. \nSo, take lack of compassion and self-identification and you&#x27;ve got it. Still, being a bitter cunt is zillion times better than getting hit by a tram, because you don&#x27;t care. Also, a lot of chicks just dig guys who are short on empathy, which is a nice reward. And when need be, empathy is extremely easily faked, because people are not very suspicious when they need it.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_self-evaluations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_self-evaluations</a>",1382637660

This coming from people in the industry like Intel execs.<p>Then Apple used it for iPad and demonstrated that people would buy it. Apple has designed and already sold a lot of this and will offer an ARM Desktop in the future. The difference is that Apple uses to show finished products, not prototypes like MS loves to do since Windows 3.11 days.<p>[Edit:I'm wrong here, OLPC does not use ARM jet,but AMD, but the idea was that low power comp has been seen as a toy when it could transform mobile computing]",1294347500

Feminism on the rise: Our Bodies Our Selves.<p>1980's:  Women and males be equally dangerous, equally pro-sex. Aids causes concern all around. Anti-porn.<p>1990's:  Feminist backlash.

It gets a little meta when you look up that film on Wikipedia:<p>""I should have called my agent or had my lawyer come to the set because you can't force someone to do something that isn't in the script, but at the time, I didn't know that. Marlon said to me: 'Maria, don't worry, it's just a movie,' but during the scene, even though what Marlon was doing wasn't real, I was crying real tears.

Xcode and Final Cut both run in multi-window yet effectively fullscreen mode, but act as IDEs for their respective workflows.  In fact, this IDE mentality could be the new big divisive topic in the Mac world: Coda <i>vs</i> Textmate and Safari and CSSEdit and Versions and... Really, it's the same war as Vim vs Emacs (<i>somewhat</i>), just with GUIs. Does the application need to be full-screen and kitchen sink, or multi-window and able to integrate with others?<p>I do agree, this could be a nuclear, apocalyptic scenario.  But while photo, video and code workflows can be condensed nicely into one app, traditional mac workflows have been multi-window, multi-app in that most common tasks aren't IDE-oriented, and constructed from many different apps running on the Mac <i>platform.</i><p>But, to counter your point about app laziness: most mac developers came to the platform to make <i>really good apps.</i> If it was about just throwing something easy out there, they'd have run to Windows or enterprise apps already.",1294344591

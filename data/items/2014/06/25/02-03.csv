If the government wants to do something it should be limited to tax reductions / removal for particular industries while they get going. Unfortunatly this would probably only work if Australia could also be shifted around 10+ hours closer to America (the continent), until then it&#x27;ll be driven by the needs of Asia, which is simply energy.<p>Edit: I wonder how unpopular this comment will turn out to be...",1403665114

Because it is much more efficient for me to just assume that nothing is copyright when I creating something new that incorporates the work of others.  It is overwhelmingly more efficient to just ignore copyright on the Internet -- our computers are the greatest copying machines ever made, and spending our time trying to figure out if some data is copyrighted is nothing but a retarding force.",1403665103

7942014,comment,7941757,7941914,2,0,quink,,,"> billions to infrastructure<p>Oh, what&#x27;s this? I think it was the sound of Tony Abbott on Jon Faine&#x27;s program back in February last year lambasting Labor for treating the NBN like an infrastructure project instead of a broadband project.<p>Between this and ensuring that the maximum guarantee they&#x27;ll have on upload speeds will be all of 1 Mbps I can assure you that the coalition&#x27;s idea of an NBN is much more geared towards a video delivery mechanism for FOXTEL than anything else.<p>Apparently Microsoft upped their storage plans to 1 TB for a pretty cheap price, but forget about using even a fraction of that capacity here in Australia. What matters is that Murdoch gets a free extension of his HFC network and FOXTEL can use the spectrum on that liberally for free forever. And then they&#x27;ll just call all the lines, regardless of technology, &quot;Fixed line&quot; (oh waitaminute, they already have) and just tread it all the same way to make sure FOXTEL will and Telstra will always have a leg up.<p>Those FTTN nodes? Those tens of thousands. Only Telstra&#x27;s hands will be on those, and the coalition has put enough Telstra share holders on NBN Co&#x27;s board to ensure that&#x27;ll forever remain the case.<p>This isn&#x27;t about agreeing or disagreeing. The coalition&#x27;s policies are so pants on head stupid ass-backwards that there&#x27;s hardly a word that could be said that isn&#x27;t immediately pointing out its idiocies.<p>If people can&#x27;t even put together ten words about the coalition&#x27;s &quot;NBN&quot; policies without sounding stupid, then that&#x27;s not a surprise.<p>And, if you haven&#x27;t noticed, the coalition has already abandoned the pretense that it&#x27;s going to be a national network.<p><a href=""http://delimiter.com.au/2014/01/06/abandoning-national-broadband-network-label/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delimiter.com.au/2014/01/06/abandoning-national-broad...</a><p>So, it&#x27;s not agreeing or disagreeing, nor is it slander. It&#x27;s an object fact that it&#x27;s not a country-wide Internet project any longer.<p>By all means, try me. If you have anything to say about the coalition&#x27;s &quot;NBN&quot; policies I&#x27;ll be happy to dismantle anything that&#x27;s been presented to you as an actual thing but is really just a ridiculous pretense.<p>tl;dr: The coalition ain&#x27;t interested in country-wide Internet. They&#x27;re interested in delivering a &quot;video entertainment system&quot; because that&#x27;s synergetic to Murdoch&#x27;s interests and because it smells similar to the average drooling FOXTEL-subscribing moron in an election period to an actual broadband network that they&#x27;ve kept up the appearance of building. But when you get down to it, to the physical layer it&#x27;s 1 Mbps for guaranteed coalition upload speeds vs. 1244 Mbps for Labor with fairly tiny contention to make it a little worse than that. All for about the same amount of money in peak funding and you don&#x27;t want to know how much worse the coalition&#x27;s is beyond that.",1403665033

I was in a conversation with two artists the other day, one professional and one amateur. They both firmly agreed, that drawing someone else&#x27;s characters as a commission was morally wrong and legally grey, and when I asked why, they say, &quot;Because they&#x27;re taking my money.&quot;<p>&quot;But you wouldn&#x27;t have gotten money there anyway, if they had never produced the art.&quot; I argued. They countered by saying, it was stealing. &quot;But what would it cost you?&quot; Nothing, they said, but it wrested control from them, and potentially could lose them the rights to the work. &quot;Wait- howso? You retain ownership, you&#x27;re simply letting others use your work as inspiration and get paid for their efforts. It in turn, draws more to your story, your world- who loses?&quot; They argued that was the &#x27;exposure&#x27; angle, and I didn&#x27;t really know what to say- I mean, I wouldn&#x27;t have watched Sherlock if not for the legions of fanart of it on Tumblr, or listened to Jay-Z if not for the works of Girl Talk.<p>They argued, all content should be original- but I can&#x27;t fathom that. Is art, similarly to science, not an iterative process based on the input of dozens, hundreds, thousands of people that came before us?

And maybe that&#x27;s just because I&#x27;ve never created anything of interest, or of value, or maybe simply because I don&#x27;t understand the implications.  But it seems to me that it&#x27;s better, or at least more efficient, to assume everything is copyrighted once it has been created rather than requiring everyone to file a form with an associated fee for everything that a person ever decides to create (&quot;What if somebody decides they would use it in a commercial??).<p>Of course I would like to see the above coupled with <i>extremely</i> short default copyright lengths, and then perhaps an escalating fee for subsequent extensions.  And given our current copyright climate, I suppose I would still side with the author.  But I think there&#x27;s a middle ground where content creators aren&#x27;t spending their time filing forms and paying fees, but rather <i>creating</i>.<p>But maybe if that creative work isn&#x27;t popular immediately, you move on to other creative endeavors.  And the copyright-free diaspora of your previous work serves as advertising or &quot;proof of merit&quot; of your new works, if you&#x27;re truly creative.  And if you&#x27;re not (like me), but you happened to have one and only one monetizable work that happened to be extremely ahead of its time... well then maybe at that point you should just be happy that humanity eventually discovered what a genius you were.<p>I look forward to hearing about where I&#x27;m wrong about this particular aspect, because I feel like I must be overlooking something.",1403663970

Language isn&#x27;t static; words change and grow in meaning over time. Look at &#x27;capitalist&#x27; for instance; the sense in which it&#x27;s used by capitalists now differs from its exact meaning when originally coined by Marx.<p>The focus of ancaps is on direct force because ancaps consider that kind of coercion bad. They don&#x27;t consider indirect force similarly bad, as I&#x27;ve described previously. This is a philosophical difference between ancaps and traditional anarchists.<p>You speak of &#x27;privileges&#x27;; ancaps are pro privilege. Privilege to people who save more and/or people who invest productively. Why? Because saving and investment is vital for economic growth. If there is no benefit to saving/investing, no &#x27;privilege&#x27;, then people will have no incentive to save or invest, and development will be slower. This is one reason ancaps support private property  rather than just possessions, as private people is required for people to be able to accumulate property, to be able to save.<p>You&#x27;re speaking of land being occupied in the sense of actual active usage, I was speaking of it being occupied in the sense of being owned by someone. This is what I mean about communication being difficult when the meanings of terms used aren&#x27;t agreed upon beforehand; two people can make statements that are both valid but mean different things, talking past each other. You&#x27;re correct in saying there&#x27;s lots of unoccupied land in the anarchist sense of occupation, but I&#x27;m correct in saying there&#x27;s no unoccupied land in the sense that all land is legally considered someone&#x27;s private property.<p>How would people not need to work if all land was being cultivated or in use? It would depend on the use; if for instance all the land was being used for subsistence farming, people would definitely still need to work, as land doesn&#x27;t farm itself.<p>>Finally, your whole argument stems from the fact that you see private-property as some form of natural law<p>You&#x27;ve hit the nail on the head there; ancaps literally do consider property a &#x27;natural right&#x27;, and have made various arguments for this. This is a fundamental difference between libertarian and non-libertarian types.<p>Land ownership may be considered a form of investment. Much as someone can own lots of gold they can&#x27;t physically use themselves, someone is allowed to own lots of land in a libertarian framework.<p>Ancaps would argue that aggression isn&#x27;t required in maintaining private property, as they&#x27;re treating private property as a natural right, and thus any attempt to deprive a person of their property consists of a violation of that right, and therefore someone defending their property is considered to be acting in self-defense, not aggressively.<p>Essentially, if property is considered a natural right than the person trying to take the property is the aggressor, whereas if it&#x27;s not considered a natural right (or moral equivalent, whatever the terminology) then the person defending the property is the aggressor.<p>The issue thus ultimately comes down to the one&#x27;s view on private property.

On mobile, those can end up providing much faster user interactions than doing everything via canvas (which it seems is your proposed alternative).<p>For example, with IE on Win8, your DOM UI is actually composed of DirectComposition layers, and touch manipulations (pan, zoom, swipe, etc) are performed entirely on a separate thread from your UI+JS using DirectManipulation and a kernel feature called delegate input threads, controlling animations of the composition layers on yet another (composition) thread. You&#x27;ll have a heck of a time matching that with canvas and mouse/touch/pointer events on your lone JS UI thread and the dozens of responsibilities it&#x27;s signed up for.<p>Again, it depends a great deal on what you&#x27;re doing. And it&#x27;s a trade-off for sure... DOM is expensive, and if you&#x27;re doing something too complicated then having panning and hit-testing on another thread doesn&#x27;t help if the user ends up seeing large unpainted regions for a while, or if you make your startup time painful by trying to build a complex scene upfront. But you asked, so I answered :-)<p>There are also other important considerations:<p>1) It&#x27;s easier (at least until we get some awesome UI frameworks on top of canvas, if that works out well).<p>2) It&#x27;s compatible with older browser versions.<p>3) DOM layouts and controls support various accessibility features, input modalities, etc.<p>4) There&#x27;s a huge library of tools/utilities/reusable components all designed specifically for it.<p>(I used IE/Win8 as an example because I&#x27;m familiar with how that works in great detail.

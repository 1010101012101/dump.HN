It gives the defense a leg to stand on by specifying ""technological"" access barriers and their ""circumvention,"" and the amendments also exclude ToS violations as barriers. But what's to stop a prosecutor from arguing that unrelated technological barriers were in place elsewhere, and the fact that a defendant didn't encounter these (technological) barriers still constitutes circumvention? I guess there'd be a big fight over ""circumvention,"" but IANAL so perhaps it's all moot.<p>I also don't understand how ""changing one's MAC or IP address [in order to circumvent] 'technological access measures'"" doesn't constitute a violation in principle, even if their proposed bill decides to whitelist those two behaviours notwithstanding other portions of the bill.",1359824289

Care is taken to develop software that's secure from the very beginning, with security-related patches being a rare occurrence later on in the extreme case that something was accidentally overlooked.<p>The Ruby and Ruby on Rails way is incompatible with the OpenBSD philosophy. Were Ruby, Rails and related software developed properly, there wouldn't be the need for constant hand-holding from the OpenBSD package maintainers. I don't think that the OpenBSD developers should be held responsible in any way for the negligence of the Ruby community.<p>Getting rid of these questionable ports is a good example of the proactive approach to security taken by OpenBSD. Constantly patching low-quality software is not the correct way of dealing with the situation. Essentially getting rid of this code is the correct approach, and that's why it is good to see the OpenBSD developers following that path.",1359824075

5156452,comment,5155816,5155816,7,0,fecak,,,"Speaking in absolutes about recruiters is never useful (see what I did there?).  Recruiter here with 15 years in the biz, and I've written lots on my jobtipsforgeeks.com blog about the perils of working with recruiters. I'm also working on a book with a similar theme that will expose some of what recruiters do, in order to help tech pros to at least be aware of things recruiting concepts such as 'candidate control' or why recruiters ask certain questions certain ways, or the differences between retained and pure contingency recruiters. Knowing a recruiter's motivations is key, and there is not enough transparency in the market today.<p>I personally don't use references as a source of candidates and only call a reference when clients request them (most of my candidate pool comes through past candidates that I trust).<p>Regarding compensation, what the comments here seem to be forgetting is that you as a candidate have every right to turn down a job, and in almost all cases the recruiter makes more money by getting you a higher salary. In contract situations this is usually reversed, where every dollar they can negotiate you down is another in the recruiter's pocket.<p>Some posting of fake job ads certainly happens by lower end firms, just as hiring companies keep ads up all the time to grow their network of candidates. It's somewhat dishonest, but not sure how it hurts job seekers (not advocating it, but seems a somewhat victimless crime).<p>Recruiters are trained to ask everyone for referrals, and early in my career I probably did. Now I realize that if you treat candidates well, with honesty and respect, and if you provide candidates with something for free, they will refer their friends (with the friend's permission) without me aging to ask. The free service I choose is information - my blog, a monthly newsletter of tech articles, discounts to conferences and events that I negotiate for my network, inside information on companies, etc.<p>Many recruiters are simply not good at their job, but every industry has some of that. Find a good one that doesn't ask you for things, and that actually provides you with good information and service, and avoid the bad ones. It really is that simple. Use recruiters that your friends recommend and set parameters and boundaries (don't send my résumé anywhere without permission, only contact me in this way, don't call references until x, etc). If they don't respect your wishes, drop them and don't recommend them to your friends.",1359823695

I like Jonathan (the author of the blog) and stopped by his blog to leave a comment to answer his question.<p>But if you asked a neutral third party, ""Which is better? To spend your time working on new algorithms for paid links? To write blog posts or make videos about paid links? Or to reply to emails justifying working on paid links?"" I think the the neutral party would put replying to emails about paid links at the bottom of the priority list.<p>And the amount of email at Google is pretty epic.

But many people want to install gems system-wide so they install with sudo.<p>The real problem is executable code. Building C extensions typically <i>require</i> invoking arbitrary commands.

If a RubyGem is being installed as a normal user, the compilation code should still be run as a separate, sandboxed user, to prevent it from messing with the user's home directory. Any build products that the compilation process generates will be copied over the destination directory. The sandbox user's home directory would be wiped after every installation.<p>This would severely limit the C extension building system's power (they can't generate files outside the gem directory etc without being wiped) but I think that's acceptable.

These would include the student's interest, aptitude, and maturity/self-control, the parents' interest and engagement, the administration's effectiveness at providing a safe environment conducive to learning. Clearly, these factors are interrelated. Any worthwhile study needs to collect sufficient data to reasonably represent these contributions to the outcome.<p>Let me cite a concrete example: My wife is a teacher in a small private school who teaches chemistry, physics, calculus, and statistics to students in grades 10-12. Some of these are actually college level classes taught under the umbrella of a local community college, following their rubric. She spends many hours refining her classes and labs to make them more effective and engaging. As she looks at her grade distributions, they are ALWAYS bimodal. She can tell you by mid semester where most students will end up. Many will not do homework or study for tests. She will put notes on homework asking for students to see her about a problem and they will not follow up. She uses the school's academic warning system to notify parents, often with no response. Indeed, any parent can see any grade at any time by logging into the schools web site. The sad truth is many parents and students just don't give a rip. This is why many teachers roll their eyes when the ""good idea fairy"" suggests ""let's do another study to evaluate teacher performance.""<p>It is high time we evaluate the performance of students, parents, teachers, and administrators in this process.

While it's easy to do it on purely text (ASCII) files, it's a bit more work on HTML files or binary files. For them you would probably extract the textual context first (e.g. stripping HTML tags) and then compare the clear text. Alternatively you may render the HTML/PDF file and do visual comparison, then extract the diff text from images.<p>By default diff programs create a line-based output, but you can change it to minimum per-word highlighting via options (e.g. 'git diff --color-words').<p>The thing with PDF is that often even when you re-save the same PDF file in the same editor, you would probably get entirely different files. I'm not a PDF expert but from what I've learned, PDF is the type of file that saves kind of vector representation of glyphs and their placements and is often unaware of what that glyph represents (depends perhaps on the program used to create the PDF and options).

Why force the user to use a convoluted curried syntax such as `f(x)(y)` for his two-parameter function?<p>So the `f(x,y)` form has been added as a mere syntactic sugar.

The event programming system they use is at least powerful as Game Maker&#x27;s GML (if not more so) and you can also write your own plugins with JavaScript. Out of three mentioned programs, C2 is definitely my favorite for a couple reasons:<p>- It&#x27;s built from ground up with 2D development in mind. Unity in comparison is primarily for 3D development, and while its 2D tools have improved over the years the difference is still really obvious.<p>- The overall user interface design of C2 is actually from this decade and makes good use of big screens of today. In comparison, you can still very much see the relatively ancient roots in Game Maker&#x27;s UI when programs were designed with 640x480 screens in mind, not to mention how tons of features added over the years have just been slapped haphazardly into wherever there was room in the UI at the time. Game Maker&#x27;s drag & drop coding is also just terrible, it&#x27;s really either GML or go home with it.<p>- Pricing. You don&#x27;t have to pay any extra for additional exporters or such with C2. Of course, there is the caveat of having to pay extra attention to mobile performance with C2 games being HTML5-powered on everything it exports to, but on actual computers you can cover the Windows/OSX/Linux combo very nicely.<p>Now, I mostly do game development as a hobby (which I&#x27;ve been doing on and off ever since I was ~9 years old), but if I wanted to do a commercial 2D indie game project for release on Steam (or similar) today, I&#x27;d definitely use Construct 2 for it. If I wanted to do same except for mobile, I&#x27;d probably evaluate C2 for it too (simply because I like it so much), but I might end up using something like Unity instead if performance proved to be too much of a headache with C2.",1447300260

That requires a separate right, something like: the right to pay for the best defense you can afford.

10551170,comment,10545887,10550973,0,0,billforsternz,,,"Article author here: I do mention the idea of using a chess engine to improve compression. I propose a simple scheme and calculate/estimate my scheme would compress moves in a reasonably played game to about 3.9 bits each on average. I am sure it&#x27;s possible to do better, but I suspect you&#x27;d hit diminishing returns before you get close to 3 bits.<p>I really should have included something about adding an opening book as I thought about that quite a lot. My conclusion was that an opening book is not going to be a really dramatic win. A simple scheme might encode say 64K opening sequences using 2 bytes, and save an average of perhaps 10 (half) moves. So a saving of 10*4 - 16 = 24 bits, spread over an average of 80 (half) moves. So about 0.3 bits per move.<p>You might question my estimate of 10 half moves max, but it&#x27;s an educated guess.

The number of people who have Coursera courses on their CV is amazing.  And to be honest, it works (on me, anyway ;-) ).  It communicates the idea that they have initiative and that they value improving themselves.  These are traits that I want in people that I work with.<p>Personally, I hate organized forms of education (and I spent 5 years teaching English as a foreign language in a high school!)  Point me a text book, or blog posts or whatever and I will work through it at my own pace and in the order that I prefer.  But I have to admit that it&#x27;s pretty hard for me to put anything on my CV.  The Coursera certificates (and I suppose these &quot;nanodegrees&quot; -- I haven&#x27;t looked into this and know nothing about it) have a lot of value in that sense.  From my experience hiring, I think it&#x27;s certainly worth a few hundred dollars to have things like that on your CV.  If it catches on (as it appears to be doing), then the bar will be raised and you will have to spend more to stand out.  There is definite opportunity.",1447299583

In some ways, you&#x27;re right, that is similar to what is being proposed, but there are some key differences. Let&#x27;s use the US system as an example again.<p>The money in the new system would be debt-free. This is a very important part of the system. Central banks like the Federal Reserve would not be accruing more debt just to do their job (for those that may be thinking having that debt is good, a decent chunk of US taxes goes into servicing that debt, effectively paying off the interest on a loan you didn&#x27;t need to take out in the first place).<p>Not only does it take the debt burden away, it also allows greater flexibility with economic strategy. For example, in the current global economic system we go through cycles of activity. When the economy is booming, more money is created, facilitating easier trades. However, in times of recession, the money supply shrinks (or rather the flow of available currency shrinks), making trades harder just at the time when more money would be useful to help the economy recover. Instead what you want is a money supply that can expand even during a recession, and that&#x27;s easier to arrange by using debt-free money guided by a central authority.<p>Transparency is another key difference. It should be possible to follow most/all of the debates shaping monetary policy. Correct me of I&#x27;m wrong, but we don&#x27;t seem to have this level of insight into the inner workings of the Federal Reserve.",1447299551

Maybe some day I&#x27;ll give it a whirl.<p>For years now, I&#x27;ve wanted to see a wider availability of affordable plant-based proteins, particularly at normal grocery outlets. At the same time I understand that for many folks, beans are ideal since they&#x27;re quite affordable. Soy milk is a prime example of the difference in cost between plant and animal protein. Not only does soy milk cost about 2x what cow milk costs, but it has only about 65% the protein per serving, making it more like 3x the price. Perhaps there will come a day when these things are more affordable, but I fear it may never happen since food seems only to get more expensive with time.<p>The main thread was talking about technology, so maybe someone can come up with a way to process and distribute plant products more efficiently. There is a certain dilemma here in that many plant-goers like small-scale operations, when large-scale operations and bulk processing are necessary for the lowest prices. In this sense, there seem to be two separate goals being combined together -- the desire to return to the olden days of family farming, and the desire not to eat meat. I have also felt that there is something of an elitist culture surrounding some of the vegan circles, where much of the food is very high quality yet rather pricey. Perhaps it dates back to Hitler&#x27;s plant-based diet, which was also seen as high-class and elite.

I&#x27;m hardly a spring chicken and I was exposed to Office in elementary school. I would imagine that the proportion of people who&#x27;ve never used an office suite (and can&#x27;t use Google to search for answers for how to do things) is fairly small at this point.<p>In my experience, adding the Ribbon was a huge step backwards in terms of usability, not because the Ribbon is inherently bad, but because it was a very big, very abrupt change from the File | Edit | View ... menu system that preceded it. I was working on an IT helpdesk at the time the Ribbon rolled out (with Office 2007), and the backlash from users who couldn&#x27;t apply the same set of steps that had always worked for them to do things like adjust paragraph spacing was immense.<p>I feel like Microsoft was blinded by its focus groups. Perhaps the focus groups included people who weren&#x27;t familiar with Office, or with computers at all, and that skewed the results enough to make it seem like the Ribbon was a good idea. But in practice, the cost of adopting the UI is not just the cost of learning the new UI, but also the cost of <i>forgetting</i> the UI that preceded it. The Ribbon might be great if you&#x27;re starting from scratch with a new UI, but the existing Office 2000 UI was so entrenched, the cost of forgetting was huge.",1447298099

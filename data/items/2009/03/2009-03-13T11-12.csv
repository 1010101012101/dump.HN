It's mainly written for that audience. In case you come from Lisp or even Ruby or Python I'd strongly recommend A Gentle Introduction to Haskell (<a href=""http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/</a>).<p>It's been the officious Haskell tutorial since 1998. It's short, free and written by very relevant members of the Haskell community.",1236945128

I'm only about halfway through it (it's big!), but IMHO the writing is quite clear without being dry or shying away from harder material. Very well written.<p>The main idea of the book is that no one programming paradigm is the best fit for all problems, so it's worth knowing several, their respective strengths and weaknesses, and the ways in which they can be combined. The examples are mostly written in Oz, a language of the authors' invention, but they're not dogmatic about it - it's just a multi-paradigm language well suited to showing different techniques in isolation. (I made a quick attempt to port Oz/Mozart to OpenBSD/amd64, but didn't get it working. I wrote examples in OCaml and Scheme instead.)<p>Also, if you appreciate reading attempts to solve problems from multiple angles, Project Euler (<a href=""http://projecteuler.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projecteuler.net/</a>) is worth a look. You can read other peoples' solutions after solving each problem; I've learned a lot about algorithms that way. (The problems are predominantly mathematical.)",1236944974

514753,comment,514047,514270,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I don't know, I think it was fairly thorough -- at least, for a quick read on somebody's webpage.<p>Regarding Leonardo as a tinkerer, based on his description of Mozart's works, I'm pretty sure that this guy would find da Vinci to be creative.<p>As for the rest -- I was excited when he mentioned cost versus benefit for curiosity, and disappointed that he didn't spend more time on it.<p>Curiosity is <i>dangerous</i>. I've been lucky to have survived several different bouts of raging curiosity; as a species, curiosity about things like nuclear reactions has brought with it the risk of self-annihilation. Space exploration has claimed a number of lives, as has more conventional exploration throughout history.<p>If you're one of the people that likes to equate everything that modern humans do to some evolutionary development, then I think it would be easy to show an evolutionary disadvantage for very curious creatures. The most curious have pretty good odds of disappearing and never coming back, or getting themselves otherwise killed or removed from the gene pool.<p>What would be left is the childlike curiosity that he was talking about -- curiosity sufficient for exploring the immediate environment, figuring out what's good to eat and what isn't, what's dangerous and what isn't, and once the environment becomes ""safe"", you stop exploring.<p>I have one quibble though: I don't think that this solves the case of anti-intellectualism in the sense that most people would think of the term, which is a hostile response to intellectualism. What he described was more of an apathy towards rigorous curiosity; when I think of anti-intellectualism, I think back to high school.<p>My guess is hostility towards intellectualism is just a way for some people to level the social playing field against other people. Just as intellectuals who are not well-suited to sports will sniff down their noses at the very idea of chasing some stupid ball around a field, so do the greater majority of people sniff down their noses at the very idea of exercising your brain if you don't have to.",1236944881

514751,comment,512491,512788,0,0,domdelimar,,,"It's kind of strange talking about the right to kill oneself. Of course, we mean that each of us is the master of our fate but it just sounds strange to read that someone has a right to kill oneself. If one didn't, what would happen if one ignored the fact that he doesn't have right to do it?<p>Anyway, I'd say it this way. I have never been there when I thought there's no other way out, maybe for a fraction of time but that may indicate I've never been in situations where people like Tony have been. So I can't really say with certainty how I'd behave in a situation like that but I can say this: The life isn't just a possession, it's, as far as we know, a remarkable gift and since nobody knows for sure what's beyond that, it's really tricky thinking whether it's better to--just not be any more. Are we sure we would be better off if we just weren't alive anymore? This brings in a lot more questions and answers depend solely upon what you believe. I believe I will always be better off by being rather than not being, until of course the time comes for that. A friend of mine, God I don't know how he's now, used to half joke saying he likes to feel pain every morning even though he could barely dress himself and function normally due to his illness, but feeling pain every morning meant that he is still alive.<p>But as someone already said here, what Tony did prior to disappearing was a clear call for help, even though maybe not so clear to himself. I'm hoping he finds the strength to fight indefinitely now that he can clearly see the support he has from his friends and community. I wish people close to him realize what he needs most right now is support and understanding for his condition, no matter what some people say. No one can tell for sure what he feels. A life is a serious matter, not to be taken lightly. Unfortunately, too many people find out about that too late.",1236944535

514737,comment,514047,514047,0,0,DavidSJ,,,"Two serious problems with the article (though I didn't read every word).  First, he says:<p><i>What evidence would it take to prove your beliefs wrong?<p>I simply will not reply to challenges that do not address this question. Refutability is one of the classic determinants of whether a theory can be called scientific.</i><p>This falsifiability criterion <i>is</i> what determines whether a theory is <i>scientific</i>, but there is a larger category of theories which are not all empirically testable yet are subject to <i>rational criticism</i>, and are therefore rational, though we must generally hold them with a lower degree of confidence than we do our scientific theories.<p>In fact, his very claim is an example of a rational yet non-scientific theory!  For he himself has not provided us with the evidence it would take to prove his theory that evidence is necessary wrong!  And so we see that there are meaningful, important ideas which can be judged on criteria other than evidence (in this case, internal contradiction, though that is far from the only criterion).<p>Second:<p><i>But the view that we all start out curious and creative, and have those qualities systematically stifled, fails to address some core questions. Why should it be possible to stifle these qualities at all? If there are people who see benefit from stifling curiosity and creativity, why should those benefits outweigh the benefits of encouraging curiosity and creativity? And assuming that there are people with a vested interest in stifling curiosity and creativity, why should they be able to prevail over those members of society who value curiosity and creativity? If curiosity and creativity are general traits of human beings, anti-intellectualism should be a rare and aberrant phenomenon. It should be regarded as a variety of mental retardation, or a condition as undesirable as impotence. The only possible conclusion is that there is something fundamentally wrong with this model of human nature.</i><p>This is certainly not the only possible conclusion.  Only if you presume that human behavior never has unintended consequences must you think that someone must see themselves as ""benefiting"" from an act in order to do it.  The simple fact is that our educational institutions <i>do</i> do tremendous damage to curiosity and creativity, and they do so despite having the <i>exact opposite motivation</i>.<p>Further, his examples of civilizations that failed to make various or other accomplishments (Sub-Saharan Africans, Romans, etc.) is only evidence that problem-solving is <i>hard</i>, and that the innate curiosity that human beings are born with is not <i>enough</i>.  We need a good <i>tradition</i> of scientific and rational discovery to complement our innate curiosity, in order to create great things.",1236943659

514729,comment,514626,514626,0,0,pixelmonkey,,,"I just (voluntarily) left a comfortable job at a behemoth corporation to start my own company with a friend from college.  I thought I was being brave, but apparently I'm just succumbing to a fad?<p>I don't think it's that starting a business is ""cool""; I mean, I guess it is, in some sense, although paying for your own health care isn't very cool.  For me, this quote was apt:<p>""People’s attitudes to security and risk also changed. If a job in a big organisation can so easily disappear, it seems less attractive. Better to create your own.""<p>It's not just about job security.  After spending two years in a large corporation, I firmly believe that these shops provide less security, less on-the-job learning, less valuable experience, less opportunities to improve society, and in many cases less <i>pay</i> than ambitious young people can achieve otherwise.  IMO, working at a large corporation, now more than ever, is an excellent way for you to hide, duck for cover, and defensively draw a paycheck.  And mediocre people who take this posture are very clever indeed about ensuring they won't be laid off.<p>But if you actually want to do something meaningful with your life and happily spend your days working on a project you believe in, big corporations will rarely satisfy your needs.<p>Although I had a relatively good experience in my two years at my behemoth corporation (my last day is today, incidentally), the best thing I learned is how I'd rather not repeat the experience.  I also look back on the two years and think that my most memorable moments (even technical achievements) happened outside of work.<p>With the means of production well within my grasp as a software engineer, and with big corporations going into a holding pattern and nixing interesting projects just to ""keep the lights on"", it seems like a no-brainer.

514726,comment,513183,513816,0,0,asb,,,"I like the look of your service. It always seem to me that when you start pushing these low price-points, the expense of dealing with customer support, DMCA takedowns, hacking complaints etc would dominate the cost of providing the hardware and bandwidth. I expect this is why Linode and Slicehost don't go below the $20 price point. Do you find this to be a problem - are you valuing your time at a very low value? Perhaps you avoid this to an extent, I expect your low profile and simple web design helps keep away problem customers.<p>I really think it would be worth the investment in time to provide an auto-provisioning system and some more images for the major Linux distributions. Linode gets by booting a standard kernel for all distributions (with the option of pv-grub for your own), which might reduce the support cost and is probably more convenient for most customers. Also, are you running Xen 3.3 now? (the Kernel compatability page on your wiki indicates not, though I thought pv-grub was new to Xen 3.2 or 3.3).",1236942631

But a book by Flynn is <i>not peer reviewed</i> and may be influenced by his political views (he is author of “How to Defend Humane Ideals: Substitutes for Objectivity” after all).<p>> Anyway, scientific issues aren't decided by credentials, but by data.<p>This is true – but data in peer reviewed journals not books.<p>> In other words, what Jensen and others took as a ""culture fair,"" ""g-loaded"" IQ test turns out to reflect modifiable educational experiences that children have or do not have.<p>The majority of psychologists believe that the g-factor is an innate and immutable property. The g-factor correlates with reaction times, glucose metallisation rate and is highly heritable. This indicates that the g-factor most likely have a neurobiological basis (see articles by Haier for example).<p>In a recent article the g-factor also appeared in a battery of 42 tests (Johnson,W Bouchard, TJ, “Just one g: consistent results form three test batteries”). Here is a quote from the abstract:<p>> The concept of a general intelligence factor or g is controversial in psychology. Although the controversy swirls at many levels, one of the most important involves g's identification and measurement in a group of individuals. If g is actually predictive of a range of intellectual performances, the factor identified in one battery of mental ability tests should be closely related to that identified in another dissimilar aggregation of abilities. We addressed the extent to which this prediction was true using three mental ability batteries administered to a heterogeneous sample of 436 adults. Though the particular tasks used in the batteries reflected varying conceptions of the range of human intellectual performance, the g factors identified by the batteries were completely correlated (correlations were .99, .99, and 1.00). This provides further evidence for the existence of a higher-level g factor and suggests that its measurement is not dependent on the use of specific mental ability tasks.",1236942525

It starts with a simple core language, and a set of features, like dataflow variables, lazy evaluation, higher order functions, concurrency, ports (message passing queues), mutable state, backtracking. Then it explores what happens if you take a subset of these features. For example dataflow variables + concurrency is deterministic concurrency. Mutable state + higher order functions can support object oriented programming. Ports + concurrency is an Erlang like model.<p>Lazy functional programming is just one of these models (higher order functions + laziness).

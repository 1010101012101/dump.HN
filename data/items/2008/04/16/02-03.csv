Even if everything goes perfect as far as they're concerned, it will be a while before you would get a check. The VCs want to meet with you for two reasons:<p>1. They are interested or invested in what you are doing. They may be planning on investing in that market, or they may have even already invested in a startup and want to scout out their competition. They may also be invested in a complimentary area and are thinking about how what you're doing could add value to what they already have.<p>2. They are curious and think that what you're doing has potential (read: They think you can make them money). They may or may not try to invest, but the possibility of investing is used as ""bait"" to get you to meet with them... except in this case you don't want the bait.<p>In either case, I suggest meeting with them. Let them take you along for the ride, but always be cautious. There is a possibility that you could benefit from their contacts, and starting the money talks now will help if/when you need it in the future. Just be aware of the fact that they might be meeting with you to gather information that can be used against you.<p>Good luck! You've obviously started something that has at least got their attention - for better or worse!",1208314059

164817,comment,164506,164613,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"In response to your point: <i>What happens when one starts to take off? You'll either leave opportunity on the table or you'll ditch your other ones (screwing all of your other ""partners"").</i><p>This has been something I have been thinking about a lot lately, and is certainly a potential issue, but also certainly not as dramatic or black and white as you have stated.<p>Here is some background.  Previously, I had two businesses, one with myself and one with a partner.  My partner also had another business.  When our joint business “took off” (two years in) I had just signed up for a two year graduate school program to take on the side (though for the other students it was their full time gig).<p>We talked about me not going to the program, but I ultimately did.  And when that happened, nothing got dropped and I don’t think any opportunity was left on the table either.  In fact, I believe my program helped contribute greatly to our success as I was able to bring in various ideas from the program.  Again, I think this is a benefit of spreading risk and having multiple things floating around in your head all the time.<p>Yes, there were crazy hours for a while, but I was able to meet all my obligations quite well.  And nothing really changed fundamentally when we “took off” except we were making a lot more money and having a lot more fun!<p>This time around, I expect to be in even a better position to manage a “take off,” which I hope happens, but I am not expecting such.  After all, like you say, <i>any</i> traction is difficult.",1208313313

164812,comment,163552,163552,0,0,datalyst,,,"I agree.  I recently presented at a local angel and VC conference.  Many people believed in our idea, but we were asking for $500K.  I already had a high profile company who had already signed an agreement to conduct a trial with us.  The $500K was to be used for the trial as well as marketing.  I got the same comments about traction, looking for later stage companies.  At this point, I would rather take a loan out from a bank or arrange some creative funding than go to a VC again.<p>I think sometimes it really comes down to guts.  We can all site and do the risk analysis on a good or bad investment, but a gut call has to be made in the end.  I think for one reason or another most VC's have lost the mindset.  It may also be the change in the environment.  The dot bomb may have left serious psychological impediments that most VCs do not want to relive so they shy away from these investments even though it can provide sensational returns.",1208313131

Entrepreneurs usually put all their eggs in one basket, to the extent that the average return on entrepreneurship ends up being less than the opportunity cost of getting a standard job.  I simply don’t think this is necessary, especially in the realm of Internet startups.<p>Of course I am also interested in other alternatives to spreading the risk, e.g. entrepreneur collectives, equity swaps and the like.  But I have yet to see anything where the numbers work out well.  So I ended up with this approach (for now).<p>Anyway, having had some success and actively reflecting on it and others, I have come to believe that usually success can be traced to a making a few good decisions or coming up with a few good ideas and then executing those decisions and ideas exceptionally well.  Coming up with those good few is the hard part, in my opinion.<p>In my experience, however, this risk distribution approach has yielded me those good decisions and ideas faster.  Maybe it is letting things ruminate more instead of moving at 100mph all the time.  Maybe it is just me.  I don’t know.  But the less time has not been an impediment to date, and I think it has actually helped move in the right direction more of the time.  Like I said in the post, “Needless to say, I have to work smart and efficiently for this principle to even be executable.”  I guess it wasn’t “needless to say.”<p>As for executing exceptionally well, that is where the other principles come in (see my other response).",1208311782

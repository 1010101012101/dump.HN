This is an important subject that doesn&#x27;t receive nearly enough attention - it&#x27;s even acceptable to joke about male victims of rape on tv in a way that would be totally unacceptable if it were about women.<p>But a sizable number of the groups addressing this are dominated by men who try to deny the female experience of rape (rape against women doesn&#x27;t count as rape because they were drunk, or they were a friend of their rapist, or because they didn&#x27;t fight, etc) or they distort sexual violence statistics to claim that more men are raped than women.<p>Or look at groups discussing family courts. There&#x27;s an unwillingness to accept that some men are abusive fathers or abusive husbands and that children or spouses need protection from those men.  Family law is browen and unjust and many men are being denied their human right to a family life with their child (and ditto children their right to family lofe with father) but you need to accept one of the many reasons for that is the huge numbers of women murdered and beaten by their spouse and the large numbers of children murdered and beaten by their children.",1433149126

While it&#x27;s not technically a problem, it takes away the real test of &quot;is the idea worth voting for&quot; and turns it into more of a popularity contest.<p>Just my 2 cents. Maybe others have had great experiences (and certainly some of the &quot;products&quot; posted are cool), but I&#x27;m skeptical of Product Hunt in general...<p>My suggestion is to stick with truly democratic places to share your new things (if you want more unbiased feedback), and submit press/news directly to places -- they want good stories and interesting ideas/products to share with their readers if what you have is a genuine contribution.<p>Good luck!",1433149121

So much so that I&#x27;d argue that even tired old arguments with idiots and assholes are worth revisiting occasionally because sometimes, on rare and special occasions, idiots/assholes have something to teach you.  Not nearly as often as they like to think.  But, sometimes.<p>Usually they don&#x27;t.  Usually their arguments are ill-formed, confusing, irritating, a bit scary, pretty-surely not worth the emotional investment required to confront.  But, if you don&#x27;t occasionally perform a genuine check on your assumption that the assholes are also idiots, you shouldn&#x27;t continue to confidently move forward acting on that assumption.<p>I think that HN is incredibly valuable.  I think it still has a fine mixture of inspirational and questionable criticism.  Not a homogeneous, consistent, reliable mix, but a fine mix nonetheless.  But also, not a mix that is effortlessly self-sustaining, certainly.<p>And so, even though I disagree with him, I&#x27;d like to thank Zed for making the personal expenditure to call out HN on some of it&#x27;s bullshit.  He&#x27;s on the receiving end of more criticism than most.  Whether that criticism is inspirational or questionable is a good question...

That topic is of likely commercial value.<p>The MIT AI Lab projets like the Lisp Machine were financed by DARPA. D stands for Defense and ARPA for Advanced Research Projects Agency. It was always expected that the research was paying back with real applications and improved defense capabilities. Remember, it was cold war money.<p>The Lisp Machine companies LMI and Symbolics were basically startups founded by people of the MIT AI Lab.<p>Stallman was at best naive. What did he expect? That government/DARPA would finance his hacker paradise without actual results indefinitely? The MIT AI Lab cost huge amount of money and was a part of a DARPA research and budget plan. Commercialization of the research was a part of the plan. The companies then should work on bringing research results into deployment or enabling more specific research - DEFENSE stuff. For example many of the early Lisp Machines went straight into SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative) research.<p>> Nobody had envisioned that the AI lab&#x27;s hacker group would be wiped out, but it was&quot;<p>Maybe he should have talked to the lab director, checked with the DARPA director, should have looked at the business plans of LMI and Symbolics, etc. etc. Then he would have known what was going on.<p>Did he expect that Greenblatt founded LMI, Inc. to create a new computer company and did not need any people? Where should the Lisp hard- and software experts be coming from? The market? Which one? There was none. This was all new stuff, straight out of university research - financed by DARPA for DARPA. Thus LMI people were coming from the AI Lab.<p>Symbolics had at it best time almost 1000 employees with over 250 software engineers. Where would these people come from?<p>Background can be found in these two books:<p><a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/strategic-computing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/strategic-computing</a><p><a href=""http://www.newquistbooks.com/brainmakers/brainmakers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newquistbooks.com/brainmakers/brainmakers.html</a>",1433148293

9637282,comment,9637061,9637061,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I worry about Zed. He&#x27;s obviously a very bright guy, a very helpful guy, and a very productive guy. But, he also seems to be dealing with a lot of pain.<p>It&#x27;s true that the Internet hate machine focuses on Zed a lot more often than many in his position (as he notes, he isn&#x27;t powerful, he isn&#x27;t wealthy, he is merely nerd famous), and I&#x27;m uncomfortable with that and don&#x27;t support that. I like to see the hate machine directed exclusively at powerful, or at least evil, people. Someone like Zed, as we can see from his response, can be genuinely hurt by it. And, that&#x27;s unfortunate. He doesn&#x27;t deserve to experience this pain, regardless of how angry or upset his tone or approach can make some folks feel.<p>That said, Zed&#x27;s not doing himself or anyone else any favors with public meltdowns like this (this is not the first, though it may be the worst). I don&#x27;t believe HN is anywhere near the worst offender, with regard to personal attacks and similar being tolerated. In fact, I can&#x27;t think of a site that is more pro-active about excising personal attacks. However, sometimes there is a bit of a blind spot when personal attacks are directed at someone &quot;famous&quot;. I don&#x27;t remember any of the negative posts Zed is talking about; and I&#x27;ve been using HN since <i>very</i> early, and far more regularly than is healthy. I don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about; what he describes is a massive, orchestrated effort to defame and insult Zed Shaw, with many participants.<p>I don&#x27;t know how I could be so completely oblivious to something on such a scale. So, one of us is imagining the scale of the problem. It is either vanishingly small (compared to other sites with user content), as I see it, or it is the predominant tone of the site, as Zed sees it. It really can&#x27;t be both. Since the reality of the site I see is so very different from the reality of the site Zed sees, I find it hard to be sympathetic to his plea for reform. I want to be sympathetic, and I don&#x27;t want to deny Zed&#x27;s lived experience. But, reading what he&#x27;s written and making that fit into my own reality of HN just isn&#x27;t working.<p>Finally, the tone of this rant is so far beyond acceptable that I&#x27;m even less inclined to sympathy or empathy. What he accuses HN, and pg, of doing (that I&#x27;m really finding hard to believe without references), he is <i>actively doing</i> in this rant. This is an attack on every HN user, in addition to pg. I&#x27;m not particularly bothered by it; I&#x27;ve been on the Internet a long time, and I don&#x27;t take any of this shit personally. And, I imagine pg is not terribly bothered by it (and he can wipe any tears away with one of his hundreds of millions of dollars). But, Zed <i>is</i> definitely making it personal.<p>I have never wished Zed anything other than the best. But, this rant does make me think maybe both he and I would be happier if he took a break from the Internet for a while.<p>And, on that note, have I just completely missed seemingly years of sustained and intense Zed hatred on HN or is Zed imagining that it is far more pervasive than it really is?",1433146222

But the problem was that it had a different set of bugs on every platform. I guess that codebase was very old and could have been shared better between platforms. So at least for for non-Windows users that meant the plugin crashed daily on whatever input you happened upon on the web.<p>It also had (and still has) an enormous set of language features, a billion codecs, a handful of protocols and several different scripting languages, a vanishingly small subset of which was still maintained. The result was probably the most insecure software ever to grace the face of the Earth. Running by default. Taking input on every web page you ever visited.<p>So it was never just a &quot;marketing controversy&quot;. Sure, Apple and Adobe could never agree on the terms for flash on non-Mac devices. But that alone would never have been enough for the demise of Flash. Google, and to a lesser extent Microsoft, did large parts of the work. They were rightfully concerned not just with Flash as a vector for malware, but also the power it brought to Adobe who could single handedly decide what Flash would run and on which platforms.",1433146073

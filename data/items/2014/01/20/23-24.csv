Make you wonder if our industry&#x27;s mind share being wasted on web apps and consumer gadgets because of the profit incentive associated? Just seems like an unbelievable symphony of fields all playing in concert, let alone having it all work as expected in <i>production</i>!

This left me with the unfortunate inability to run NetBSD, which I desperately wanted to do as I was just getting into computers at the time and wanted to use an OS that, unlike the friendly classic Mac OS, was closer to bare metal and let me do things like write my own programs ( which I couldn&#x27;t really do in classic Mac OS because the main development tools were either insanely expensive or had critical features disabled, such as the ability to create new projects. ) So all the IIfx owners were flooding the NetBSD users mailing list with their successful boot-up stories, and I couldn&#x27;t get beyond the bootloader prompt. I eventually had to take the 68LC040 out and replace it with a 68040 so I could use NetBSD and other powerful software like Infini-D...<p>We&#x27;ve come a long way.

Help desk software is one situation I can think of it being really valuable, another is user feedback on websites where a user clicks give feedback -> selects &quot;include screencast&quot; -> app notifies them to record, on send it&#x27;s sent back via the API and then the feedback widget can say &quot;great, your screencast has been received!&quot;. Maybe the app could even track the users environment so that it would be extra helpful for situations where the user is demonstrating something.<p>For that idea you could keep the app free as it is now, but add that functionality and charge businesses for API access. Although now that I think about it, asking a user to install an app/program (the first time they ever encounter someone using the service) might be a bit off putting to users.",1390260371

7092351,comment,7091253,7091253,6,0,tvladeck,,,"For two years I ran a company called Building Hero (www.buildinghero.com) that marketed and financed LED lighting retrofits to commercial locations in New York City and San Francisco.<p>Here are a few things to consider when wading into energy efficiency finance:<p>1. Returns to energy efficiency upgrades accrue out of negative cashflow (money not spent), which means its hard/impossible to put a legal &quot;box&quot; around the financial returns to the project, contra solar investments, where there is a meter and it&#x27;s usually possible to slice and dice who gets what.<p>2. Energy efficiency upgrades also pose a problem with respect to collateral. In our case, although we had the right to take back our LED lamps, the value of what we got back, even in the best case, would have been negligible. Most EE upgrades are even less inviting as collateral, like insulation or HVAC upgrades.<p>3. There are simpler, but more balkanized (i.e., different not only from state to state, but even utility to utility, or city to city) financial incentives for energy efficiency upgrades. This poses a challenge for finance as a differentiator for energy efficiency. Simpler incentives mean the value of a third-party financier who abstracts away these problems is less valuable; and more balkanized incentives mean that is harder in any case for a third-party to offer solutions that scale geographically. Again, contra solar, where the federal tax  incentives mean that it’s almost necessary for a third-party with tax equity appetite to finance a portion of the investment, and since it’s at the federal level it scales across the US.<p>My advice would be to do some careful thinking about how and why your financial offerings are better than what you could do financing them on a credit card or through a normal bank loan.<p>In addition, I would put some serious thought into whether or not finance is the true barrier for energy efficiency projects. Again unlike solar, these things are inside the home/office/whatever, not outside, so bring up aesthetic concerns as well as comfort concerns. Other things, like HVAC systems, are usually replaced when they break.<p>Anyway, I hope this is useful and that you get a lot of projects done!",1390260234

So assuming that this guest blogging stint is a rare or unique thing for these guys whatever changes are made will probably have no effect at all (i.e. the dofollow links will still &quot;work&quot;). The next most likely thing to happen is that the algorithm somehow figures out that they are guest posting and disregard the any backlinks. Finally, there&#x27;s a possibility that there will be a slightly negative effect. If it does turn out to be the case there is a penalty, then in the future you can configure the CMS software to put nofollow on guest post links and then it will certainly be neutral.<p>Regardless, they will still all get the exposure that comes from getting their names out in front of your blog&#x27;s regular audience.",1390260176

I was making it clear that this is nothing like a VC model, which is voluntary. If we were to make the comparison, it would be that people could chose themselves what research, if any, to fund.<p>The issue with panels allocating taxpayer money, is that their interest is still in government. That is, they will fund research in which government has an interest or is neutral, and consequently, any research which is potentially harmful to government is scrapped (even if it would be beneficial to the taxpayer.)<p>One might not think there&#x27;s a distinction between what benefits the government and what benefits the taxpayer if one believes in the fairy tale that governments exist to benefit the people.",1390259208

Meaning that each service has to be manually set from within Cabot.  I also see several settings are hand-set in the foreman environment.<p>With Riemann/Godot, I can simply POST JSON (with any metrics) to the Riemann webhook from any number and type of services and servers.  Riemann/Godot also make it easy to push data back out, to further analyze or aggregate.<p>In a way, I&#x27;m looking for something less complicated -- a 1GB VPS should be overkill for a small instance.  But I&#x27;d also like it to accept JSON POST from anything with a matching API key.  And store it in a database not run on localhost.  With this configuration it should be able to scale as the services scale.<p>Cabot does make some good points about distributed infrastructure and external testing.

It is coming to trial in 2014 and the participants have probably spent well over a million dollars each getting to this point. That alone tells you all you need to know about the chances that a startup company has in getting justice or even just surviving against a garbage patent abuser in court.<p>Google did not own Motorola when the case was filed and Google is not a named defendant, contrary to the deliberately misleading headline.<p>The Reuters article doesn&#x27;t say anything about what the six patents claim or even give their numbers. Those numbers are 7,810,144 (the &#x27;144 patent), 6,412,953 (the &#x27;953 patent), 7,409,450, 7,120,462, 6,557,054, and 6,658,464.<p>The Reuters article does mention that the accused devices are older Moto phones and accessories. Newer devices than 2011 are, of course, not in the original complaint and usually are not added at this late stage.<p>The &#x27;144 patent is for a &quot;File Transfer System for Direct Transfer Between Computers&quot; -- describing a subset of SMS or IRC style messaging -- filed in 1997 and repeatedly rejected until the PTO folded under seven continued amended petitions in 2010. There is no limit to the patent amendments an applicant can make and no such thing as a final rejection at the PTO. Applicants are encouraged to reword claims to cover technology invented by others since the original application. [1]<p>If you&#x27;d like to be infuriated about how the patent system abuses software and computer networks, read the linked [0] opinion starting on page 14 where claim construction begins.<p>The &#x27;953 patent was filed in 1998 vaguely describing long established LCD backlighting practice. The &#x27;054 patent, &quot;Method and System for Distributing Updates by Presenting Directory of Software Available for User Installation That Is Not Already Installed on User Station,&quot; was filed in 2000. The &#x27;464 patent, &quot;User Station Software That Controls Transport, Storage, and Presentation of Content from a Remote Source,&quot; is like iBooks or Archie and filed in 1994.<p>The &#x27;450 patent, &quot;Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Packet-Centric Wireless Point to Multi-Point (PTMP) Transmission System Architecture,&quot; was filed in 1998. It describes the use of any QoS scheme that includes packet inspection over a wireless network.<p>The &#x27;462 patent, &quot;Portable Computing, Communication and Entertainment Device with Central Processor Carried in a Detachable Handset,&quot; filed in 1999 describes handheld computers with a docking station. It does not describe how to build such a device, of course, just that one could exist.<p>[0] Summary judgement motion here explains most of the issues <a href=""http://www.ded.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/slr/2014/january/11-908.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ded.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/slr...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.patenthawk.com/blog_docs/2004_Continuations_Lemley&Moore.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patenthawk.com/blog_docs/2004_Continuations_Lemle...</a>",1390258928

There is no point trying to hold logical conversation with people who are dishonest.<p>People are just trying to bring out their own arguments. It&#x27;s not all that weird to argue that someone would want to have more male nurses because the public image of nurse is feminine.<p>Some arguments are weak and some are strong. For example, in abortion, the two most flammable are status of the fetus and the woman&#x27;s right, but to be honest, after reading Rosalind Hursthouse&#x27;s Abortion paper, you will that neither is relevant in the discussion of abortion. But we still bring them up because that&#x27;s just how people view the issue and I think that&#x27;s fair and not dishonest.<p>Dismissive and dishonest responses are those just reject facts without proof. For example, if someone says there are enough women in the tech sector that&#x27;s a lie because we know the number is not high and we shouldn&#x27;t place any quota at all. But if someone says that we have enough opportunity for women to enter the tech sector that&#x27;s not dismissive or dishonest. It&#x27;s a fair argument because the lack of resource vary from location to location, from age to age, from school to school and vary from personal experience.",1390258918

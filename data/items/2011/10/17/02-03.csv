But each of them also have hundreds or hundreds of thousands of other customers, which creates the vertical economies of scale.<p>This is not new, corporations have had sub-contractors and suppliers throughout history. But what is new is that the small one-man shop will have a dozen suppliers from day one. It's a brand new ecosystem still in it's infancy, it didn't even exist to this extent when Facebook and Youtube was started.

That said, I'd say around 50% of the system administrators I've worked since moving into the Unix world know C and can at least read the source code of the operating system they're supporting.  Even if there's not much need to write anything or even submit bugfixes anymore.

Languages and frameworks these days pretty well abstract the underlying technology. Developers end up writing some pretty amazing stuff. It's up to the sysadmin to weigh in on what changes are necessary to make it work well enough to succeed. A seasoned developer will know more, because they've been through the wringer a few times. The new guys, not so much.<p>Remember, your developer spends their time making it work on a dev box, or even their own laptop. Performance testing and such is an art that if they had time to learn it... well I guess they'd be a sysadmin.",1318817883

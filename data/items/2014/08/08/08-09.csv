According to &quot;The World Until Yesterday&quot; life expectancy in traditional societies is more like 40 years. I know there is always the issue with child mortality distorting the numbers, but still.<p>As to 2), while some aspects of living in traditional societies sound great, in &quot;The World Until Yesterday&quot; Jared mentions that most people chose to live in civilization once given the choice. The main advantage apparently being to not live in permanent fear of being murdered.<p>There were countless different ways to live in traditional societies, though. Maybe some where better than others. Still, I am more inclined to believe Jared Diamond than your source.<p>Another thought on the Comanche example: how civilized was the world of North America at the time? People were coming to the Americas to escape extreme poverty and starvation. And there still seemed to be wars raging on. Maybe not at all comparable to our modern comfy civilization?<p>I don&#x27;t remember all aspects, but I think hunter gatherer actually have to work less than farmers. There are certainly advantages to that lifestyle.

8151966,comment,8149132,8150884,4,0,fmblwntr,,,"I think you are reading way too much hostility into this post. I think it&#x27;s clear that David Samuels has a lot of respect for Coster-Mullen, all he&#x27;s doing is establishing him as a &quot;person,&quot; by giving his notable personality traits.\nI thought this article was an inspiring account of how somebody with no formal training in the subject was able to recreate an incredibly complex machine, simply through his own intelligence and hard work. The sentence you quote is definitely not ridicule, but simply an accurate description of Coster-Mullen&#x27;s approach, I certainly don&#x27;t think the Samuels was intending to criticize a positivist worldview and most certainly not to be &quot;corrosively anti-geek.&quot; Furthermore, through the article, Samuels repeats how impressed he is at how much Coster-Mullen figures out simply through basic reasoning, math and geometry, I mean it includes a complete description of how he painstakingly tracked down a vintage car so he could measure the size of a box in a photograph. I really have you no idea how you managed to read this article as suggesting that Samuels believes Coster-Mullen is deserving of ridicule, instead he seems very impressed, as does everyone else who is interviewed in the article. (Still not even sure how you got &quot;anti-geek,&quot; Coster-Mullen doesn&#x27;t even seem like a &quot;geek,&quot; just a normal person with a family and a hobby, who is simply very good and dedicated at it.<p>An article that simply repeated the facts about what Coster-Mullen had discovered about the bomb would simply be his book. Everybody has their quirks, and an accurate representation of the person (because indeed, the article is about John Coster-Mullen, not the atomic bomb) should include more than a bare listing of facts about their life.\nOf course it seems a bit ridiculous, but what hobby on such close inspection doesn&#x27;t? I think reading it as a criticism is very far removed from the author&#x27;s intention.<p>I do agree however that the title of the article (on HN) should probably simply be &quot;Atomic John,&quot; it&#x27;s okay for an article title to be a little bit mysterious, and using a subtitle creates a bit of the wrong impression in this case. (I am not sure about what the actual guideline is however)",1407487199

There are a few missing pieces still holding me back.<p>But it still irks me that mainstream OS&#x27;s lack so much that AmigaOS has (e.g. FrexxEd exposes all open buffers as files, so you can e.g. use diff and patch between your last saved version of a file and the in-memory buffer, or run gcc on the in-memory buffer to get an error report into another buffer. Of course you can do the same with tmp files, but why should you need to?)",1407485282

At first the text says people don&#x27;t get ahead by education and hard work, and then it lists examples of the (few, of course) example who did get ahead and all of them got ahead by hard work and education?<p>Of course most people don&#x27;t get ahead. We are wired to keep the same level of things we know. If we want to study how to get ahead we must study those few who do get ahead, or at least analyze why the ones not getting ahead didn&#x27;t get or take their chances.<p>Another point I want to discuss:<p>I grew up in a village where people also live on the lower social end. Only thanks to my mom I was able to get away from there (education and hard work). And I can say that it&#x27;s not just all unfair to people who end up in the same low situation as their parents (drugs, alcohol, no job, single parents). In fact teachers, social workers, police officers, old people on the street, the super market cashier,... many people try to support them and give them chances. But many people simply don&#x27;t take the chances. They can choose the math teacher helping them passing the exam in his spare time without pay (and where I come from teachers already work unpaid overtime in their normal jobs), and they can choose to sit all day at the bus stop, get drunk, use drugs, etc. Many simply choose the second option, because they don&#x27;t know how to think long term. It&#x27;s not all unfair just because poor people often stay poor.<p>Third point:<p>Assuming my observation is correct, then what can the government do? If people already get chances to work their way up, but they don&#x27;t take it, what are the options? Force them to not take drugs? Force them to study 6 hours every day? We live in a free country. Hard to convince anybody that this might be a good decision. But if you let people have a free will, to some degree you must accept that people are very lazy.",1407485013

But there&#x27;s legacy cruft still in there that isn&#x27;t addressed.<p>Like the bookmarks and history manager.  There isn&#x27;t anything particularly wrong with these data-table windows, but I don&#x27;t really enjoy using them either.  In some ways I think they should be at the heart of the browser.<p>I think a lot of people use tabs because bookmark management is so crap.<p>The only bit I resonated with was the similar sites suggestions.   But you&#x27;d need a setting to setup suggestion services.  There&#x27;s a privacy concern with that.<p>Other helper features:<p>Pagination buttons were built into Opera driven off the rel=prev and rel=next, link elements.   Navigation could further be ripped out the page window into a browser control.  Searching sites and pages could be friendlier.  Better form helpers needed.  A good feed reader would be good.   Tools to help read web content more simply (readability style) would be nice.  Plus I like personalising the look and feel of my web browser ever so slightly,  and even Firefox doesn&#x27;t do that particularly well (it ignores some of my desktop theming).<p>So I think Firefox should really be thinking how to answer the question:  &#x27;How can we make it easier for users to consume web content?&#x27;.  This has to go beyond the rendering engine.   So actually a fatter featureful browser I think would be better - but with some very intuitive and simple controls.",1407484929

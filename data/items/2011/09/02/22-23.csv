2955929,comment,2955472,2955516,7,0,siglesias,,,"Two factors have led to the perception that tablets are ""consumption"" devices.<p>1) A tablet is a computer you can hold. Books and magazines have over time become optimized for holding (see size and weight) precisely due to the ergonomics of reading. Thus one would expect that tablets, which can store a vast number of books and magazines, would be ""optimized"" for such content.<p>2) Due to (1) it makes sense to trade power for battery life and thus iPad-era tablets use ARM processors. Word processors, music editors, video editors do exist for tablets and each has full privileges to have any interface it wants by assuming the full screen. Over time that software will get more powerful as these low-power processors advance. It can't be argued that iOS itself hinders content creation, but it can be argued that slow processors do. Time will take care of this.<p>Also I don't see consumption--by which you mean reading--to be a bad thing to do with a computer. Amazon's stated purpose for the Kindle is to enable every book in every language ever printed to be available in under a minute. That's an extraordinary vision if you think about it, and we're getting there very quickly. Hardly a step backwards.",1315004393

So that I can ensure that messages always get delivered. I was going to continue using SQS until this functionality is well tested.<p>Having said that, this is a good temporary solution for me to shutdown the crawlers. And I see absolutely no harm in abstracting the use of capped collections into an easy to use library.<p>Is it as well developed as a mature AMQP queueing solution? Of course not, I don't claim that it is. Having said that, I trust MongoDB in my stack as a means to communicate between processes, and am confident using it for the use-cases that I am. As long as I'm doing this, I see no harm in open-sourcing the helper libraries I create for doing so.<p>Am I a huge advocate of MongoDB? No, but if you happen to have it in your stack, as I do, It's handy to be able to use it in a similar manner to the way that Resque leverages Redis.",1315004282

I think Facebook, to take the biggest example, restricts and narrows and makes shallow our communication.[0] It reduces our interactions to shallow, superficial comments, likes, low-fidelity photos, etc. In its way, I think the move toward closed social networks is also a step backward from the open exchange of ideas that blogging represented.

Listening to music (consuming) became insanely easy in the last decade, but, surprise surprise, the tools to create music improved just as dramatically.  Just as importantly, the ease of consuming enabled musicians to draw on an unprecedented pool of influences - many genres have undergone wild transformations as artists have been able to access more inspiration with increased ease.<p>Some here might dismiss TV completely, but many consider this a ""Golden Age"" for television writing, too.

Kindle at the moment is very much associated as a device incredibly well suited to reading a book, and the existing third generation one is incredible at this. If I'm paying three times as much for a Kindle tablet, they've got to be selling it me on features that compensate for the less-optimal reading screen and massively reduced battery life. They've got to be selling it on the basis of tablet-like apps.<p>This might mean a focus on magazine/more graphically designed newspapers, perhaps distributed through the Kindle Store, that take advantage of the nature of the Tablet's screen; but at the very least it will have to be a tablet with an exceptionally capable browser.",1315003976

2955884,comment,2955062,2955690,6,0,rbranson,,,"Celery is best on RabbitMQ, but supports tons of backing stores, not that you necessarily should[1].<p>How is RabbitMQ a lot of machinery? Compared to Redis, AMQP and Rabbit have the complexity of a bologna sandwich. It's actually a quite simple system, and very easy to install. There is almost always no configuration necessary. Developers can install it in one command with MacPorts or Homebrew or apt or yum and don't even have to create users or ""vhosts"" to get started. Create a named exchange, subscribe to it, you're now AMQPing. It's well-packaged and well-documented. It's also so light on it's feet that it rarely actually needs a dedicated box; just stick it on your database server to get started.<p>I think Resque is a good solution for Rails, for sure. I've built stuff around it, and it works well, and definitely battle tested. It certainly beats the existing AMQP-based solutions. The idea that your application code probably sucks and/or is in a constant state of flux, so handle failure gracefully is rather excellent. The web interface is particularly nice and useful. While I don't necessarily agree 100% with Redis as the backing store, the actual mechanics of the worker queue implementation (plus tools like resque-pool) work so well that for most projects, it's perfectly fine.<p>I actually had a problem specific to using Redis materialize when it ran out of memory while queueing a large batch of per-user-generated weekly emails. A cron job would spin up a script that would cache a large amount of database data in RAM, using it to generate per-user content. The rate at which email could be sent became a major bottleneck, and we had Resque, so we just enqueue'd the entire email and had a small job that connected to the email server and send them. This worked reasonably well and for many months, the high watermark for RAM usage was well below what the box could hold.<p>Unexpectedly, the amount of content contained within these emails quadrupled. Redis ate through all the RAM on the box and it started going to disk using Redis' VM mechanism. This was configured  to ""theoretically"" prevent an unexpected OOM from making the queues unavailable. The unfortunate part is that the Resque stores the entire queue in a single key, and when the key gets swapped onto disk, Redis must read this entire key (and therefore the entire queue) into RAM before it's able to read any data from it.<p>This wasn't Resque's fault really. It was my fault. I did not take the time to understand how Resque and Redis worked well enough to make a truly informed decision. I did not test the OOM condition. I should have tried to fill up the queue on a test box with a billion items just to see what happened. All lessons learned.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2011/01/20/rabbitmq-backing-stores-databases-and-disks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2011/01/20/rabbitmq-backing-sto...</a>",1315003428

They also don't focus well on human rights; they drum up more publicity for US diplomatic cables than, for example, Chinese dissidents.

I can move, cut, and select up, down, left, and right. In DrRacket I also know how to do things like rotate s-expressions and move an s-expression outside.<p>Since I've always felt that Vim is inferior for Lisp development, I try to use Emacs. Unfortunately, I feel a million times slower in Emacs than Vim simply because I've used vim for years.<p>I feel like, if I wanted to feel comfortable coding in any Lisp, I would have to code non-stop in an Emacs-like environment for a year, and I haven't had the discipline to do that yet.

Emails or comments on HN (another one of those things that wasnt possible for very many people one or two decades ago) work great, longer or more complicated stuff quite often not. There are, however, quite a few use cases where tablets are better tools for content creation than, say, a PC or at least could become better tools given time and software.<p>But I feel you are ignoring the larger picture. Tablets are currently third devices and prices have developed in such a way to actually allow for a third device.

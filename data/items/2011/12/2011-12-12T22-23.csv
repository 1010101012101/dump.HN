3345429,comment,3345161,3345410,8,0,_delirium,,,"One problem is that it's <i>much</i> bigger, so the main contributors no longer know each other. When I started editing Wikipedia in 2003, I'd look at the ""Recent Changes"" page and at least recognize the name of everyone who made more than a few contributions, and I definitely knew everyone who was active in meta-activities (mailing list, Village Pump, etc.). The Italian Wikipedia is roughly like that, with a few dozen major contributors, and in some ways they're actually more tightly knit than even 2003-era English Wikipedia, because the vast majority live in Italy within a few hours' train ride of each other.<p>The English one, though, has grown so huge that it's more unwieldy now. I no longer recognize even some very prolific contributors, because there's no feasible way to keep tabs on All Edits To Any Article. It's unclear how to go about building community and decentralized decision making in really large communities. Even just this one discussion page is unwieldy: it's been edited about 600 times since Jimmy Wales floated the idea.<p>There is also, unlike the Italian Wikipedia, a more international base of contributors, and a vocal subset are really touchy about the English-language Wikipedia being seen as the ""American"" Wikipedia, so vociferously object to it doing anything in response to USA-specific politics.",1323730760

By necessity, you either have to take a lot of time explaining yourself over and over or you make decisions based on surface criteria.

For example, if your industry relies on aggregating a lot of public data, you may be able to build a company that designed tools that collect that data, and then sell the refined data to researcher.<p>Or you can always develop out a niche site that caters to that research, where individuals in the industry can get relevant news about the industry.<p>You can contact researchers in the field and see if they need development services for custom applications and set up a freelancing shop that supports several researcher.<p>To me there should be a way to combine to two, to compete in a market that you have already built value in. I am not disparaging web development, a lot of people will say web developers are a dime a dozen, but the reality is good developers are probably one of the rarest skill-sets on the planet and therein lies the problem, to become a skilled web developer takes years, I would say almost a decade of experience, because the web is always changing, until you have seen it change a few times, you have not mastered the skills of adaptation. Which are requisite for future-proofing applications.<p>I am getting off on a tangent, but the point is make sure you are ready to start over, because switching oars now means beginning the assent up river again, for some industries their is no choice, just make sure you have looked at all the options in yours, before you decide it is one that there truly is no choice.",1323730493

3345407,comment,3342194,3344493,1,0,skeptical,,,"The examples you pick and the way you present them are very relevant. your observations are also very well made and in my opinion very reasonable.
In fact i agree with you.
I just think your conclusion is undermined by your unwillingness to question yourself, even if you state that everybody should do just that.<p>To pick up on your example, castration. I recently red about swedish history and found out that some decades ago the Swedish government forced castration on a rather high amount of people through criminal law. Sure, the reason was supposedly not the same as in North Carolina, but if 1 to 3 percent of the population got the penalty, one may ask if the criteria were really all that well defined and legit. Personally, I also consider this horrific.
The truth is, the developed and tolerant swedish society we all know basically started after the castration trend. I will not say it's a consequence of it, I sincerely hope it's not. But will I disregard that possibility just because I don't like it? No, never. I dare to look at those facts and try to understand them. I don't like that possibility, it is brutal, but I will not censor my critical thinking.<p>We have gender distinction in sports because it's obvious that men and women are physically different. No one objects that. But no one dares to admit the <i>possibility</i> of man being different than women intellectually/psychologically/mentally, because that's a taboo. It's not obvious, there is no scientific evidence, etc. but why does everybody gets so angry if that possibility is even talked about?
I'm tired of this fake morals. You are not more respectful towards woman rights simply by staying away from sensitive topics. Most importantly, I don't mind if you think I respect women rights less than you because of my opinions. I know I how much I respect women rights, I could care less about proving it.",1323730354

For someone who didn't know any better, it seemed like a good deal.<p>The worse part isn't that it preys on startups, it's that it prays on startups and new entrepreneurs that aren't plugged into the HN/SV scene (I was looking at angel groups in TX).<p>I don't think that a nominal fee (~$10 - $20) is necessarily a bad thing (but really, why bother?), but anything on the order of $100 or more is too much for a startup to be spending on that type of thing- a definite red flag.

Chrome's seamless auto-update has brought web-app style continuous iteration to the desktop.  That means continuous change, and presumably improvement, but also no real ability to opt-out of new features/bloat and newly introduced bugs.<p>This was a brilliant move for Google because it removes the friction they face to push web-client functionality where they want it to go.  For example, I woke up one day and suddenly I could run all these new webgl apps.  We have all granted them implicit license to push code out to all our desktops -- at the cost of no longer controlling what version and bug/feature tradeoff you are running.<p>Whereas App Store apps, where the user controls updates, are somewhere in the middle of this shrinkwrap vs. web app continuum.  You get the constant nagging to download version N.epsilon.epsilon of iTunes, with 20 pages of block text describing updates that are only interesting if you are the person driving Apple's grand product strategy, but you at least get the ability to say no thanks, don't ask me again.

And a .development file<p><pre><code>    export NODE_ENV=""development""

Before you run ""node app"" just link to your variables with ""$ . .production"" or ""$ sh .production""<p>Again there are many ways to accomplish this same thing but this way is pretty straightforward if you are familiar with linux.<p>EDIT: To add to the link to configuration pkrumins posted (<a href=""http://expressjs.com/guide.html#configuration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://expressjs.com/guide.html#configuration</a>)<p>process.env will hold all of your environment variables, and express.js will read ""NODE_ENV"" internally.

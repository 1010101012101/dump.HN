And (bringing back to HN) having certain necessities taken care of could enable risk taking and entrepeneurship.  Basically, the government paying for you ramen noodles, instead of pg :).<p>I know there are lots of potential problems with this idea, but I've seen it proposed before, and think it makes a good starting point for a discussion of thinking of things like poverty, minimum wage, health care, etc. in a different way.",1221753467

I haven't done that yet because:<p>* I want to release the software that contains this validator and I want to limit the external build-time and (especially) run-time dependencies. So far, the application requires nothing except Python 2.4.<p>* The RE code is easier to unit test. When you use a parser generator you usually have to nominate start productions in your grammar. In order to unit test you have to add lots of extra start productions. That tends to substantially impact the readability, performance, and/or size of the generated code.<p>* I keep hearing that people are getting by with regular expressions to do complex stuff but traditionally I've always jumped directly to ANTLR and other similar systems. I wanted to try doing this just using regular expressions to get a good grasp of what those tools are buying me and to find out why so many people just end up using regular expressions. I found that, because this tool is just a simple validator/recognizer, those advanced tools don't really buy me much here. As you can see, the Python+RE code I posted directly mirrors the RFC 3987 grammar. If I switched to PLY or something similar, I wouldn't save anything in terms of LoC and readability wouldn't be that much improved.<p>* I've heard many times that it is best to minimize the amount of Python code that executes in the critical paths of a program; instead, we will get better performance by using native libraries (like the re module). Sometime I will probably try out a code generator as an experiment so that I can measure the performance of the re module vs. a bunch of generated Python code.",1221750201

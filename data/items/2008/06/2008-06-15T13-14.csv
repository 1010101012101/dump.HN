So a street address is normally part of neighbourhood or area of a city, which is part of a state, etc.<p>One of my other favourite projects at Y! at the moment is also about LBS. Fireagle is one of the Brickhouse projects, so those guys are actually based in San Francisco. <a href=""http://fireeagle.yahoo.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fireeagle.yahoo.net</a> is still invite only, but that's mostly to hide it from consumers until it's ready to go. Fireeagle acts as middlewear, allowing users to update their location in lots of ways through an API (Text string, GPS units, Cell phone via services like Navizon, etc) and then share is with apps of their choice. This means that the user only has to update Fireeagle to update all their apps.<p>It also means app developers don't need to provide lots of ways to specify location. They can just use Fireeagle and forget about the rest.<p>I have some invites so if you have a good idea let me know and I'll hook you up.",1213538133

218036,comment,217384,217748,0,0,xirium,,,"Layering stateful and stateless protocols minimises abstraction leakiness ( <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.htm...</a> ) while maximising future re-use.<p>Unfortunately, I cannot recommend any books on the subject. People who write successful protocols spend their time maintaining successful implementations. People who write books about protocols have typically implemented protocols which are used within small niches, if at all.<p>If you want to learn by example then the best suggestion I can give is to read RFC821 (email delivery) ( <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc821.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc821.html</a> ), RFC822 (email headers) ( <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html</a> ), RFC1094 (NFSv1) ( <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1094.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1094.html</a> ), RFC1813 (NFSv3) ( <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1813.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1813.html</a> ), RFC3010 (NFSv4) ( <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3010.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3010.html</a> ), RFC1436 (Gopher protocol) ( <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1436.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1436.html</a> ), RFC1459 (IRC protocol) ( <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1459.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1459.html</a> ), RFC1945 (HTTP/1.0) ( <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1945.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1945.html</a> ), RFC2616 (HTTP/1.1) ( <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html</a> ) and supporting documents for a mix of text and binary protocol specifications, reasonings and evolutions.<p>If you're not accustomed to reading RFCs then they may seem quite terse. Persevere and it will get easier after the first five or so. At the very least, read RFC822 because it is the basis of web and email headers.",1213537932

Taleb is smug, but he makes an important point: people are way too eager to see patterns where none exist.",1190321319

If your ad is selected then, in addition to the 2-to-3 week period your ad will show on my web site, you'll also get a $40 worth of free advertising on Adpinion's network at large.

57590,comment,57516,57516,0,0,icey,,,"I think that's very noble of you, but I have to ask why you're willing to do graphic ads instead of just text ones? <p>If you're starting a new site, graphic ads can be very jarring to new users, especially if they're just trying to figure out what your site is all about. On the other hand, textual ads can be very subtle, but still useful to any startup - if anything, just to help them out in terms of Page Rank. ",1190320950

The moment near the end where he brings out a cake for his wife is incredible. <p>We have a lot in common... same advisor, similar dreams. He's just older and a whole lot smarter. It just brought his whole message home for me. Brick walls are there to make you want it.

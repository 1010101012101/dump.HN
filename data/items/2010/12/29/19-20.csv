2049933,comment,2049449,2049449,0,0,commandar,,,">Back in June -- once Poulsen's claims that they were withholding only private information and national security secrets was proven false by The Washington Post's subsequent publication of chat excerpts that fell into neither category -- this is what I called on Wired to do:<p>This is where I disagree with Greenwald. I spent some time looking over a combined version of the logs that have been released by various sources to date[1], and didn't come to the same conclusion at all.<p>Looking at what Wired <i>did</i> release, I think two criteria stand out -- it's all about either leaks that were already public knowledge or directly related to Manning's role in leaking the documents.<p>If you look at what Wired omitted, it's most of the transcript we have for May 22. The parts that Wired chose to omit are almost entirely either about leaks that weren't yet public at the time Wired published in June or Manning talking about his mental and emotional state. This aligns fairly well with Wired's claim that the portions they chose to withhold were sensitive to either national security or of a personal nature. Looking directly at the primary source <i>bolsters</i> Wired's argument, if anything, in my opinion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://firedoglake.com/merged-manning-lamo-chat-logs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://firedoglake.com/merged-manning-lamo-chat-logs/</a>",1293652316

This is to prevent abuses where companies effectively go public by selling stock widely but fail to register to avoid the public disclosure requirements. What the SEC is looking into is the current trend of forming an LLC to buy private shares on a secondary exchange and then selling ownership in the LLC. This allows the owners of the LLC to invest indirectly in the private company effectively increasing the number of shareholders over 500 but not currently triggering the public disclosure requirements.

However, I thought most of us here earned our living through the creation of intellectual property, which we monetize or hope to monetize in a number of ways.<p>Films are very much like software startups.  One or two people come up with the idea for a movie, get seed funding, refine until they have a ""prototype"" or ""demo"" (script/storyboards/etc.), build a project plan[2], maybe go for another round of funding and then cast, shoot, and edit the film into an MVP.  Then they flog it at film festivals or wherever they can with the hope that someone with access to a major distribution channel sees it.  That 'evil conglomerate', much like a VC in taking on a lot of risk, can promote it and get it out to enough theaters or DVDs to make back everyone's investment.  In some cases, the success metric is getting enough credibility to ease the funding and casting parts of their next film.<p>These are geeks just like most of usâ€“they have a dream that requires a lot of work, expense, and networking to get sales, and it's even higher-risk than software, with a smaller overall pool of cash turnover.<p>Yes, there's the issue with the middleman, but that's something that will have to be disrupted.

That is the point; most people share your view.<p>Buses are safer because the tightly packet seats act like little pods of foam, like little safety bubbles.  If the bus hits something, it's 4 inches of foam that the kid is going to hit...basic physics, f=ma, a=v/t...the foam increases the time it takes the moving body to slow to a stop, and spreads the force over a longer period of time.  Since it would be instantaneous, not aggregate (I'm making both of those terms up, no idea what you would actually call this) force that you care about, a longer time at a lower force == a safer collision.<p>Think about it like this:  you have two buckets, one of them is called ""child"" and the other called ""seat"".  These two buckets contain a liquid called ""momentum"".  If the bus hits a brick wall, all of the momentum from the child is going to get transferred into the ""seat"" bucket.  The interstitial bucket you use to transfer this liquid is called ""force"".<p>The foam seat means that you're using a little tiny thimble to transfer the momentum from the child to the seat...it takes a long time, and it isn't very big...it's ""gradual"".<p>It's counter-intuitive, but that is one of the reasons that buses are safe.",1293650452

Statistically, sure, you can make a measurement that has a correlation. Good for you. Lots of measurements and correlations in the world.<p>To directly answer your question, why would I go about conducting an experiment to show that immigrants are at a disadvantage? To what ends would that serve? What would be the point?<p>Instead, I might would look at teacher performance, or learning styles, or class size, or school construction, or any one of a million other variables that correlate with immigrants doing a good job. Then I would look for correlation between your immigrant groups and those other variables.<p>You can pick and choose things to measure and emphasize all day long -- and it doesn't get you anywhere. You want to say that schools are doing a great job and there are factors outside their control that make their outcomes poor in certain circumstances. Fine. I get that. Could be true. Might not be true. Worth exploration.<p>But the measurement of data and the observation of a correlation is just the initial, total bullshit stage of actually fixing anything. Most of the time correlations don't pan out. Most of the time there are counter-examples to the conclusions you want to reach. Most of the time things change right after you measure them. Most of the time people who don't want/know-how to solve things just sit around making these observations as sort of a chatting class. Most of the time it's nigh impossible to string together any of these correlations into something useful. Something that sounds insightful? Very easy to do. Something that actually has value? Very difficult.<p>The reality of things is that schools are paid to make a difference, and that there are certain skills that are non-negotiable in our environment. You can add the fact that some schools are doing a very poor job of teaching these skills.<p>I think those statements are not very provocative.<p>So, make whatever measurements you want, find whatever correlations you want, build whatever models you want, <i>as long as it further serves the purpose of doing the business of schools: providing an education</i>. If the only purpose is to provide excuses and make ourselves feel better, then it's not really worthwhile. Just go decide you're going to feel that some schools never got a fair shake and be done with it. It's fine with me. It's a perfectly valid point of view to have.<p>Everything in life is like this, not just schools. You have a job. You do a poor job of it. You either: a) dig down into some data to provide evidence you are not at fault, or b) dig down into some data to start forming models you can test, <i>realizing that the formation of models is only the barest beginnings of anything worthwhile at all</i>. You seem to want to make the measurement, observe the correlation, then announce that it's causal (and then, presumably, go forward to draw some sort of political conclusion)<p>That's just a bit too far.<p>How big a factor? How difficult to control? Who knows? Who cares? The point isn't to sit around making observations and bemoaning our ignorance and lack of funds/talent/whatever. The point is that the data is only a very small bit of a solution. We can sit around measuring things and pulling theories out our ass all day long. Not going to help any kids get a better education. The only thing it might do is make us feel better about our preexisting opinions.<p>I'm not saying that these assertions are false. I simply don't know. All I'm saying is that this type of conversation can go on for a long, long, long time without any useful results. You don't want to do that, either in the real world or with some philosphical school-immigrant problem.",1293650288

Go a week forcing yourself to eat smaller portions, your stomach will shrink and it becomes natural. I can't eat what I used to call ""large"" portions before (kind of annoying when you're at a really good restaurant or a holiday dinner).<p>I also dusted my bicycle off and got back out and started riding.  I hadn't been active on that since I'd been moving around cities which are terrible for bicycling (Las Vegas being my current).  But I found some good roads and trails, found the right times to ride them to avoid traffic and I was set.  In the past 6mo or so, I've gone from 5-10mi rides to just over 60mi.  When the time changed I lost my every evening ride after work as I hate riding at night around here.  So I commute a couple miles to work every day on my bike, then do a nice long ride or two on the weekend.<p>All this together has taken me from my high school to college to post-college weight of 210 lbs down to just north of 170 in about 6-8 months.  I'm now lighter than the weight I wrestled in middle school.",1293649447

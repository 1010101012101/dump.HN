439321,comment,439302,439302,0,0,inovica,,,"I think number 2, whilst an interesting idea, has a lot of potential pitfalls. I wonder if this could be done in a social network sense where the community contacts the community looking for items, rather than via one centralised source. The two main barriers as I see are trust (once the money has been sent) and the legals of sending goods into other countries (ie import tax). This one would interest me the most.  The Linux one could be useful, but I agree that it could be difficult to make money on it.  The 3rd one is interesting on the basis that it should provide a much better service than is currently offered but your main barrier is that the larger companies prefer to deal with larger companies. You may look to sell to the likes of Capita as they could re-package what you do and they are already 'in' with these companies.<p>Are there any other ideas, or have you refined your ideas down to these three?",1232286983

439316,comment,438468,439271,0,0,andyking,,,"""Socialist Europe""? What on earth are you babbling about? It sounds like a fringe newspaper sold by scruffy types on street corners. Whatever your views, Europe is a capitalist society.<p>The UK's just as much a part of Europe as Belgium or any other European Union state--in fact, we're one of the few net contributors to the EU. I'm happy here and I'm not planning on going and, erm, sponging off the Belgian welfare state, so I'll respectfully ignore your request that I relocate (!)<p>I was never taught that going on benefits was a particularly socially acceptable thing to do. I'm glad the system is there for people who are genuinely down on their luck and can't find work, but personally I'd rather take a low-ranking supermarket job than go on jobseekers'. Having something to get up for in the morning makes all the difference, even if it's a rubbish job.",1232286717

Your ""con"" on it is genuine but if you can make a product that saves time, you can compete.<p>The first idea seems like a nice project but its risky as to if it will ever  pay the bills.  It is about time for the linux world to grow into paid software utils.  I certainly wouldn't mind paying for such a tool.<p>The second idea is too large a market to find and educate.  Good service though, I'd like to have access to it if you chose this one.",1232285646

439302,story,,,43,57,nailer,"Ask HN: I have three good ideas. Help me choose idea 1, 2, or 3.",,"Hi guys,<p>I have three good ideas, each of which I'd be capable of creating. But they're all significant investments of my time, and I really need help deciding which one is better.<p>My goals are: a business that will provide me with a reasonable income, in an interesting problem space, that will grow quickly allowing me to become self employed.<p>Having made a decision I can work much more quickly on the best idea.<p>________________________________________<p>Idea 1. <i>Decent Performance Tools for Linux</i><p>Problem: Performance data on Linux is distributed in many places, obfuscated, and very poorly documented.<p>Idea: This started out as a better version of the unix top command that I mentioned on Hacker News at http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=405361. I'd like to expand on this to offer a full suite of performance analysis tools - eg, an visual strace analyser, allowing you to:<p>* highlight errors<p>* focus on just what happened to a particular file<p>* fold 'the looking through every folder in ld.co.conf' into a neat summary of whether a library was found or not<p>* allow context for each recorded system call, eg, what each system call argument means, what package owns files being operated on, etc.<p>Pros:<p>* Its an area few people have explored, that I'm interested in.<p>Cons:<p>* I haven't figured out a decent way to monetize this. The community is used to free tools. Perhaps a Ghostscript style setup, where older releases are Open Sourced after a year, but the latest features require a subscription?<p>* Unix people often blindly prefer the way that Unix implements anything by default over alternatives - selling to them could be frustrating.<p>____________________________________<p>Idea 2. <i>Overseas Buying Agent</i><p>Problem: When you travel, you can often find particular clothing brands are cheaper overseas. Converse is cheap in the US, but expensive everywhere else. Hugo Boss is cheap in Germany, but expensive in the UK. Australian Swimwear labels are cheap in Australia, but expensive in the US. Agent Provocateur is available in the UK, but sometimes not available at all overseas. Prada is cheap in Italy. But you can't travel all the time.<p>Idea: A web based overseas buying service. Full service, deliberately targeted at the fashion market, not a re-posting service. Users would log in, provide some instructions, and have a human agent purchase whatever they need in another country. The agent would open the package, insert a card, send the now 'as new' (but second hand) goods onto the user.<p>Pros: As an Australia -> UK expat, I have good contacts in Australia, the UK, Germany and the US. The business could be quite fun. My wife is in the fashion industry.<p>Cons: Potential for legal hassles, even though the goods are now second hand. Can I rely on my close friends to work, even if they're being paid?<p>_____________________________________<p>Idea 3. <i>Security Analysis Tool</i><p>Problem: Large business need to check server's compliance to a known standard (eg, ISO security standards)  and produce a report stating the compliance results. Have noticed in my last two day jobs that the solutions to do this are incredibly poor - unpackaged software, which don't comply with modern operating systems (eg, the Linux definition files are for Solaris circa 1992), far too many false positives, and no proper guidelines to actually fixing the servers.<p>Pros: I know businesses want these tools. They're easy to program. The competition is both technically poor, and poor to look at (making it hard to sell).<p>Cons: I'd be competing with some very large software companies.",1232284360

If PHP essentially does the same thing that Ruby and Python does, there would be no reason to pay a Ruby developer more.<p>There are various levels of skill within any programming language.  It may take someone with no programming experience a day to write a small database app in PHP.  It doesn't mean that I'd be willing to hire that person to code something worthwhile for my company.<p>You can't simply real world situations into easily digested bites and act like you are saying something profound.

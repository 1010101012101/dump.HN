Everything you can do in those languages you could have done by writing a few macros on top of their predecessor, Maclisp.<p>What you seem to be saying is that the evolution of programming languages has now stopped.  No one ever needs to make a new LFSP, because SPs can do whatever they need by writing macros on top of existing languages.  Do you realize how unlikely this is, historically?  Especially in a field like programming languages, which is at the moment in a period of ferment.<p>If you think CL is the last word in Lisp, you probably have a higher opinion of it than any of its designers.   They were in the kitchen when it was being made, and they are all too aware of all the hacks and kludges that went into it.",1203183535

Postgresql is more totally Open Source, whereas MySQL is owned by Sun Microsystems.  And it is not free for all commercial cases.  Postgresql is.<p>MySql gets its speed rep from the 'MyIsam' table type.  But you don't want that for financial data. You want a stronger database. They have another several table types that are more robust and standardized, but not as fast.<p>Postgresql is plenty fast for large installations when well tuned.  And it has good referential integrity, a long-enough history so you can trust it, and stored procedures.  MySql is simpler to get started with.<p>I've never heard that SQL Server was faster, but I'd estimate they have very nice integration with .NET, as it's the same company.  This nice integration will undoubtedly lock you in to using their database forever, though.  And who knows how their price will change?<p>Whichever you choose, you will gain if you have at least one person around who has used the DB before and (for MySQL) table-type before.  Even once in a while.<p>Paid consultants are available for any database you choose.",1203182975

117026,comment,116768,116768,0,0,netman21,,,"Your point about having a version 1 and iterating quickly based on real world input reminds me of my experience as a mechanical design engineer. The most costly mistakes made in that field resulted from too much design and not enough prototype phases.  The typical design process back in the 80's was to meticulously draw every aspect of a component, send it to a machine shop for tooling, get manufactured parts and put them on the test stand. Only then would you discover that the gage was too light, the material was the wrong spec or the welds had to be moved.<p>I introduced the concept of prototype early and often. Actually re-introduced, as this is how most products were engineered in the olden days. Someone would suggest a new gage, weld placement, cross section, and I would don my overalls, head to the shop, cobble up something and demonstrate its feasibility before the draftsmen could decide what size paper to draw it on. When I worked at Chevrolet I took this to the max and prototyped entire vehicles years before the official prototype build phase.<p>When I transitioned to the world of networks and software I was shocked at how little prototyping there is. Website developers would deliver project plans that had two weeks of ""QA"" built in before the launch date. It was crazy, any major problem uncovered in that two weeks would delay the launch.  It is still challenging to get a programmer to demonstrate a prototype early. So, I think you are on to something. Good luck with ARC!",1203182630
117025,comment,116079,116243,0,0,dmoney,,,"> <i>so what? are you saying the reason poor people stay poor is their fear of starving?</i><p>I'm saying it probably doesn't help, and I can think of a couple situations where it would hurt.<p>1. You interview two relatively equally qualified candidates for a job.   One is desperate for a job; he is broke and has a few days of food left.  The other knows there are other opportunities out there for him, and has an emergency credit card in his pocket.  As a result, the second is more relaxed and confident, and can talk to you as an equal.  Maybe the first is a pressure player and would rise to the challenge, but assume he's not--you can tell he's desperate for the job.  Who do you hire?<p>2.  The same people now have similar minimum wage jobs.  They make ends meet, but just barely.  The situation sucks and they want to look for a better one, but taking time off for job hunting is likely to get them fired.  In other words, it could land them back in situation 1.  This is a greater risk for the first person than the second.<p>I don't know whether this is a major or minor factor.  It's probably a complex issue.  Still, I don't see that the guy in the article overcame poverty.  He just won in a poverty simulator.",1203182555

They were born at different times and developed by two different R&D teams at DALIBO, a French PostgreSQL company. The fact that they&#x27;ve been released publicly almost at the same time is merely a coincidence<p>OPM is designed to help a DBA to manage a very large number of servers. It provides answers to the questions : &quot;Is there a problem somewhere on my PostgreSQL servers  ? Which instances need to improvements ?&quot;<p>POWA is more focused showing the &quot;real-time&quot; activity of one specific instance.  It provides answers to questions  like : &quot;Which queries are slowing down my server  right now ?&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re familiar with Oracle products, the difference between OPM and POWA is more-or-less the difference between Oracle AWR and Oracle Grid Control.<p>In a nutshell, if you only have one or two PostgreSQL servers in production, then POWA is easier to install and probably enough for you. If you want more stats and an overview of your servers, then OPM is a better choice.<p>Both projects are autonomous and moving fast. We&#x27;re just pushing code on github without direct economic goals or marketing plans :-)  In the long run we&#x27;ll see which one finds its user base and how they evolve.<p>That being said, we also have other guys working on other similar PostgreSQL tools, in particular :<p>pgBadger ( <a href=""http://dalibo.github.io/pgbadger/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dalibo.github.io/pgbadger/</a> ) is a log analyzer which provides rich reports of the database activity. Basically it answers to  the question &quot;Which queries should be optimized ?&quot;<p>pgCluu  ( <a href=""http://pgcluu.darold.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pgcluu.darold.net/</a> ) is a audit/reporting tools, more focused on   system and resource utilization.  It answers to questions such as &quot;What&#x27;s the load on my CPUs ? Is my memory swapping ?&quot;<p>pg_activity ( <a href=""https://github.com/julmon/pg_activity/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/julmon/pg_activity/</a> ): is like linux &quot;top&quot; command but for PostgreSQL queries.<p>pg_stat_kcache ( <a href=""https://github.com/dalibo/pg_stat_kcache"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dalibo/pg_stat_kcache</a> )  will gather statistics about reads done by the filesystem layer<p>So basically regarding PostgreSQL monitoring, we&#x27;re just moving in every possible directions at the same time... Some say it&#x27;s a &quot;waste of time&quot;, we prefer the term &quot;Darwinian Approach&quot;  :P",1410344871

8295813,story,,,3,1,king_mob,"Career paths when your starting from the edges",,"So i&#x27;ve held off on asking this for awhile, as it seems to be a question that would just answer itself given enough time and effort, but what the heck. First off, excuse the extensive preamble, but it&#x27;s relevant, and i have a feeling it describes a few peoples experience not just my own.<p>So i&#x27;m 29, never made it through uni, basically through a lack of any kind of work ethic (there were always bands to play in and beer to drink), so non-graduate i guess you&#x27;d call it, but around 5 years ago i decided i in fact wanted a career, and a job that stimulated and inspired me.<p>Cue the next 5 years of basically retraining myself to have a work ethic, to be dedicated to learning on the job and in my own time, and generally putting in the hours that i should of the first time round when i was 18-20. Now i&#x27;m working as a sysadmin/network engineer/support desk jack-of-all-trades in a small hosting company.<p>I&#x27;m self taught in almost everything, i learn in JIT fashion when a problem comes along, you learn how to fix it on the spot, although i&#x27;ve taught myself programming in my spare time rather than because i had to.<p>Long story short - i&#x27;m deeper into the industry than i have ever been, and i understand a lot more than i ever did, but i&#x27;m worried now this is it, manning support desks and helping people set their new iphone up to work with their company email.<p>A lot of the threads on HN about career paths are from young(er) graduates, or people who got into a startup early on and have the experience on their CV. So my question is this, how would someone coming from the opposite direction, older, not a graduate, no professional experience, think about breaking in to the industry?<p>I&#x27;d like to think it would be as simple as: keep coding, learn the frameworks, contribute to projects and start your own to build up a portfolio of work. But is that naive?",1410343681

So I post my recommendation here too:<p>It is a brilliant novel about Franklin and his expedition: The Discovery of Slowness (Sten Nadolny) It has originally been written in german (Die Entdeckung der Langsamkeit). Very well investigated. Especially John Franklin seemed to have been a very interesting character.<p>Read the amazon reviews: people start to get philosophical, when they write about this book.<p>A great weekend read, well worth the time.

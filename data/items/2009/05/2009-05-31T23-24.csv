If you claim to see certain numbers in color, I either have to take your word for it or declare you crazy. But actually there are some very clever tests that have been developed that provide some confirmation that synesthesia is a real effect. Number-color synesthetes can very rapidly identify a shape hidden in this image: <a href=""http://mindbluff.com/syn3.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mindbluff.com/syn3.gif</a> while non-synesthetes must do a very slow manual search (the shape is hi-lighted here: <a href=""http://mindbluff.com/syn4.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mindbluff.com/syn4.gif</a>).<p>The theory of cross-wiring as the neuronal basis of synesthesia very suggestive and there may be other instances of it in other domains. For example, on the human sensory homunculus, the representation for the feet and toes are located right beside the representation for the genitals. Some degree of cross-wiring in that region could explain foot fetishes. Likewise the sensory-cortical representation of the nipple is adjacent to the earlobe, and so on and so forth.",1243814383

I eventually graduated from high school but since at the time, Chinese was not taught in school, it was not considered a foreign language and therefore could not be used to satisfy the language requirement for getting into University.<p>Instead, I applied to the local city college and spend the first semester taking high school math, physics and chemistry.  Then after two more years, my English improved well enough that I was able to transfer to a four-year school, majoring in engineering.  I also worked part-time in a laundry at minimum wage to save enough money so that I can move away from home to finish my degree.<p>After my bachelor degree, I worked summer before returning to graduate school.  Then after my master, I worked a few years before returning to get my Ph.D.  Then I worked again and after a few years, took a teaching job at UCLA.<p>When I was forty years old, I left the comfort of academia to start my first company.<p>I just took life one step at a time and every step of the way, I didn't ask for any favor, except for a chance to prove myself.<p>Now after two companies, I am retired.<p>You can do anything you want in this country, even if you weren't born in this country and didn't even speak the language.

635192,story,,,73,83,juliusmcfly,"Ask HN: Where do I go from here?",,"As a reader and lurker of HN, I've come to respect this community as a group of intelligent, high-achieving, commonsensical people<p>I decided to post this today as a last-ditch effort to receive some kind of useful counsel, fully realising that this is a highly impersonal, ridiculous, and most likely ineffective way to ask for advice. But what the heck.<p>My first experience with computing and programming came at a fairly young age, messing around with Q BASIC and GW-BASIC on my mother's 386 computer. I would devour library books on BASIC programming, and I would spend hours tinkering around writing little text-based adventure games, and drawing circles and squares on the screen.<p>My interest in computing continued into my early teenage years. I developed the habit of taking apart whatever our family computer happened to be at the time and figuring out how everything fit together. I learned some assembly language, some simple C programming, and wrote a few little games using whatever technologies I could get my hands on. I had dreams of growing up and writing software that everyone would use one day.<p>My dreams were never really reality-based, however, and I didn't ever do the hard work it takes to translate them into actuality. I just assumed that I would be brilliant and rich one day, and everything would be fine. I grew up in small towns where people didn't talk about college very much. I always felt pretty smart compared to my peers. I guess I wasn't as smart as I thought I was though, as I had no presumption that I should try hard in school, try to get into a good college, and surround myself with intelligent people.<p>So, I ended up goofing off in high school. I got caught up in the social drama, partied, and I don't recall cracking a book outside of class. I graduated with a 3.2 GPA and a 1500/1600 SAT. Until my senior year, I didn't sweat my GPA too much, I wasn't even sure I wanted to go to college. When I did realise I wanted to go, I didn't see any utility in applying to anywhere out of state since I didn't think I could afford it. I could only get into mediocre schools anyway with my miserable GPA, no AP courses, and no soft factors.<p>I ended up spending my first two years at Podunk Community College, surrounded by the same friends I'd had since elementary school. I was miserable. I finished my liberal arts requirements, with a reasonable gpa, but no desire to finish my bachelors. I started my spring semester, got depressed with my prospects, withdrew from all of my classes, and moved away to the mountains. I now work at a grocery store making $8/hour. The good news is, I'm only 20, and hopefully still have time to turn it all around.<p>I've recently rediscovered my love for computers and programming, and decided that if I ended up going back to school, I want to major in Mathematics, Electrical Engineering, or Computer Science. My only problem is that I don't even have the prerequisites done to start Calc 1 which is a prerequisite for just about everything else in those majors. I sort of want to go back to school, but at the same time, I think it will take a while to graduate when I'll have to fill up an entire semester with just a Trig class, so I can fill up another semester with just Calc 1 so I can get to Calc 2, just so I can get to the basic engineering/mathematics curriculum! I would be glad to take 20+ credit hours a semester to get myself back on track, but 20 credit hours of what? Besides that, will it even do me that much good to have a degree from an unknown state university? Is that really the best use of the next 2+ years of my life?<p>I have high aspirations. I want to found a start up. I'm sick of suburbia. I want to move to a city full of intelligence and ambition. I'm still young and idealistic - I want to change the world. I'm willing to work as hard as it takes, but as of right now I seem to be at a stand-still with my education. I've been working my way through SICP and I've recently learned the basics of Python, but I don't know if I can learn everything I need to know through self-study. Credentialism, like it or not, is still a huge factor when you have no work experience.<p>I wish I'd read Paul Graham's essay ""What You'll Wish You'd Known"" back in high school. I'm lacking sources of good advice here in Cherokee County, Georgia, so, as stupid as it sounds, I find my self asking, ""What would PG[insert name of any other intelligent person] do in my situation?"" On a whim, I decided to ask HN -- seems like the closest thing I'll ever get to an answer.",1243813196

(Especially if they're really dark, creepy woods - but I digress).<p>Job hunting is stressful even at the best of times. And this is certainly not the best of times. On top of that, you are considering a possibly necessary major shift in direction in your career and lifestyle so that adds to the stress of this. The process of searching for a job has a bearing on so many aspects of who we are that some people can be so paralyzed by the thought of it that they will stay in the same job for years to avoid searching for a new job (points finger at self). I sympathize with your situation. Getting support from those close to you as well as trying to participate in enjoyable activities that help you to maintain your sanity are likely to help you get through this without feeling too overwhelmed. Whatever direction you choose, when you emerge at the other end of the tunnel you are likely to wonder what you were so worried about. Best of luck.",1243812865

I'm having a hard time coming up with any software product that would be explosively successful without a group of people being able to agree on it.  Office software, CRM, anything on the server, chat or other interactive tool, pretty much anything someone would pay for, would likely be chosen more often if the people that person works with or communicates with also choose the product.<p>Even games, these days, are often decided on because people can play with their friends or at least share and trade games amongst their social circle.<p>Actually, it just struck me how much less solitary computing is than it was even five or ten years ago.

Perhaps people think they are only interested in the destination, but the reality is, we do often enjoy the journey too. And maybe the journey is important even when we don't enjoy it. Sure, sometimes it really is the answer we want, like when we ask Google what's ""17 meters in feet"", but I think that's only in some cases.<p>(2) Getting only an answer, or even a range of possible answers within a set of possible meanings to the question, is like saying there's only black and white, or at least, very few shades of gray.

Is an engine that's apparently so ""smart"" just predisposed to more systemic bias?<p>(3) And why do we presume that it's a question we're asking in the first place.

9389594,comment,9386994,9389477,0,0,jblow,,,"I am not sure we can make the assumption that the input and output devices are on the same clocks or run at the same rates. Maybe they are (in a good system you&#x27;d hope they would be), but I can think of a lot of cases where that wouldn&#x27;t be true.<p>However, even when they are synced, you can still easily see the problem. The software is never going to be able to do its job in zero time, so we always take a delay of at least one buffer-size in the software. If the software is good and amazing (and does not use a garbage collector, for example) we will take only one delay between input and output. So our latency is directly proportional to the buffer size: smaller buffer, less latency. (That delay is actually at least 3x the duration represented by the buffer size, because you have to fill the input buffer, take your 1-buffer&#x27;s-worth-of-time delay in the software, then fill the output buffer).<p>So in this specific case you might tend toward an architecture where samples get pushed to the software and the software just acts as an event handler for the samples. That&#x27;s fine, except if the software also needs to do graphics or complex simulation, that event-handler model falls apart really quickly and it is just better to do it the other way. (If you are not doing complex simulation, maybe your audio happens in one thread and the main program that is doing rendering, etc just pokes occasional control values into that thread as the user presses keys. If you are doing complex simulation like a game, VR, etc, then whatever is producing your audio has to have a much more thorough conversation with the state held by the main thread.)<p>If you want to tend toward a buffered-chunk-of-samples-architecture, for some particular problem set that may make sense, but it also becomes obvious that you want that size to be very small. Not, for example, 480 samples. (A 10-millisecond buffer in the case discussed above implies at least a 30-millisecond latency).",1429206930

9389575,comment,9387016,9387016,0,0,rogerbinns,,,"They neglected to mention the biggest reason for the big jets.  There are greater numbers of dense urban areas, and runway building is not matching the increase in demand for travel.  The runways limit the number of aircraft movements, so demand is handled by increasing the size of the planes.  (It can take decades for new runways to be built.  See London.)  The big jets aren&#x27;t expected to be useful on every route, but rather on central routes to big hubs.  The counter argument is people prefer direct (point to point) routes aka long thin routes, for which you need a smaller efficient plane.  Of course both are true, and the debate is really how much of each there will be over time.  It looks like big urban areas in Asia will produce lots of A380 demand, if only they wait.<p>The article mentions 50% off list prices, but for context list prices are a known joke in the industry.

Should you develop version 2 of your product with all the great things that come with that, but still have to support version 1 for a long time?  Should you do continuous improvement on the product, but the result being differences for the same item?  Other participants such as lessors get upset when you harm residual values of older product with new product, which then means they charge more for new product.  Do you do benchmarking that shows you winning due to unrealistic configurations, or lose benchmarks by being realistic?  How much can you get away with vapourware?  What improvements (in hard numbers) do you promise for something that isn&#x27;t developed yet, that has financial penalties should you miss, and makes the product less attractive if you underpromise?  How do you do new/updated product without Osborning your existing product?<p>I recommend this blog for following the industry - <a href=""http://leehamnews.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leehamnews.com/</a> - and this one which is more focussed on engines - <a href=""http://aeroturbopower.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aeroturbopower.blogspot.com/</a>",1429206770

Large wheels are good on road where you will encounter potholes etc.<p>Meh.  17&quot; wheels do great on the road.<p>So the physics is basically this.<p>DISADVANTAGES.  Small wheels have a steeper angle of attack, so they&#x27;re somewhat bumpier on tough surfaces.  That&#x27;s easily dealt with using a small full suspension to glue wheels to the road, just like it&#x27;s done on motorcycles.  Small wheels are more difficult to gear high.  There are lots of common approaches to that.  And small wheels often have more squirrely steering, because it&#x27;s harder (not impossible) to give them a lot of mechanical trail.  This in turn presents a problem for going downhill fast where steering stability matters.  Last, of course, the tires wear out faster.<p>ADVANTAGES.  Numerous.  Small wheels are far more aerodynamic.  They can be <i>much</i> lighter. They are far, far stronger and require fewer spokes.  And they have much smaller rotational inertia, translating into faster acceleration and deceleration.  Last, they allow for a much wider range of design options, including fairings.

And I say this as a <i>very</i> neuroatypical person.<p>But the thing is, when you get to the tails of the normal distributions for various cognitive and neurological functions, most of the individuals you find are cognitively and neurologically uneven.  We may be significantly higher-functioning in one aspect, while being <i>average</i> in most other aspects, and sometimes lower-functioning in one or another aspect.  The biggest mistake mainstream society makes is treating cognitive functioning as a uniform, one-dimensional spectrum from low-functioning (autistic people, low-IQ people, the &quot;mentally ill&quot;, etc.) to very high functioning (so-called &quot;geniuses&quot; and &quot;very well-balanced&quot; people).<p>I&#x27;ll use myself as an example.  The educational system simply never knew what the bloody hell to do with a small child who <i>obviously</i> suffered from nasty emotional disturbances, which were at least partially due to parental violence, and who <i>obviously</i> had difficulty interacting with others, and yet who <i>simultaneously</i> tested at the 98th percentile of intelligence and obviously wanted to make friends.  &quot;Gifted and talented&quot; classes were designed for kids who were just as gifted in their self-organization as in their ability to read, write, and do maths, and who also cooperated easily with adults and wanted to work within the system.  &quot;Special education&quot; was designed for the intellectually weak, the especially violent, and those utterly unable to direct themselves.  I didn&#x27;t fit into any category the system had.<p>So I only started getting a really decent education when I entered university, where I was, pretty much for the first time, allowed to take mostly smart-kid classes and allowed to socialize without being branded as the dangerous idiot first thing.  It worked great: I learned how to make friends and graduated with a solid circle of them, and I managed honors in computer science.  Admittedly: I now wish I&#x27;d been able to weedle out the opportunities and privileges those Good Little Children got, since in adulthood I&#x27;m seeing just how much they were able to accomplish while I was having to push to be treated as a non-moron, but oh well.<p>Weirdly enough, other than a post-undergrad bout of depression that apparently happens to <i>everyone</i> (but which nobody is ever told about...), the post-school world of work and research has been a pretty great experience!<p>And here&#x27;s the freakish thing: among the very... anything - the very intelligent, the very creative, the very emotional - none of this story has turned out all that unusual!  I attend lesswrong.com meet-ups sometimes and find that pretty much everyone else there has stories just like mine.<p>TL;DR: Society thinks that cognitive functioning ranges from &quot;really great&quot; to &quot;really bad&quot;, with each <i>particular aspect</i> of mental functioning co-varying along a single dimension.  This is approximately correct for middling cases - a person who&#x27;s average all-around will usually be roughly the <i>same level</i> of average in each particular - but almost entirely wrong for people at the tails.",1429206005

It falls short of 7z, RAR and tar.xz, and certainly isn&#x27;t ready to replace them at the moment.<p>I&#x27;m not too familiar with Coffeescript, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like a good choice of language to write an archiver. There&#x27;s no actual draft file format spec I can see, either? But from a first pass, I have the following comments:<p>Crypto: Encrypted blocks: AES-256-CBC, random IV, with no MAC (!!!). You <i>need</i> to look at that again: that could be a Problem. Hashed blocks: SHA-2-512. Maybe OK (how&#x27;s length encoded? Look out for extension attacks). That crypto is 14 years old and missing a vital bit: not &quot;modern&quot;. Modern choices would include CHACHA20_POLY1305 (faster, more secure, seekable if you do it right); hashes like BLAKE2b (as the new RAR already does); signing things with Ed25519. Look into that kind of thing. You need a crypto overhaul. The keybase.io integration is a nice thought for a UX - but is an online service in invite beta really ready for being baked into an archive format?<p>Packing: LZMA2 is pretty good: 7z and xz already use that. For a fast algorithm, Snappy is not as good as LZ4, I understand? Neither is the last word in compression. Text/HTML/source code packs much better with a PPM-type model, like PPMd (7z has that, too, as had RAR, but removed it recently), but you need to weigh up the decompression memory usage. ZPAQ&#x27;s context model mixing can pack tighter, but that&#x27;s much more intensive and while I like extensibility, I don&#x27;t like the ZPAQ archive format having essentially executable bytecode.<p>Other missing features that other archivers have: Volume splitting? Erasure coding or some other FEC? Can you do deltas? (e.g. binary software updates)<p>You&#x27;ve got some pleasant UX ideas for a command-line archiver (compared to some other command-line archivers!), but sorry, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re ready for 1.0.",1429205792

This isn&#x27;t an issue of performance, or costs, or lack of use cases- FPGAs are quite fast now and certainly can be extended to new niches that currently are CPU-bound. The issue isn&#x27;t related to any of the advantages stated in this article, it&#x27;s that the FPGA toolchain is still mired in the 1970s, a world dominated by the EE ecosystem that modern CS sprouted from.<p>Building things for a FPGA simply- for a lack of a better word- sucks. There is a lack of beginner tutorials, a free (non-proprietary) implementation tools. Severely lacking free example code and libraries. Few ways to share code, like Github. Much weaker community help.<p>Richard Stallman may be overzealous, but his impact on programming is striking if you compare it to what could have been, in the world of electrical engineers. Working on FPGAs now is crippling, when you are used to coding in the 21st century. Imaging a world where programming is without the GCC compiler, with little libraries to build on, without Github, without Stackoverflow. And THAT is the reason why FPGA adaption is low.<p>There are currently over 400,000 questions on Stackoverflow tagged &quot;python&quot;, and over 40,000 questions tagged &quot;mongodb&quot;. [1][2] In contrast, there is less than 2000 questions for the Verilog language, and less than 500 for Xilinx, even less for Altera.[3][4]<p>I have helped organize several hackathons at my University, where the largest one consisted of over 2000 people from across the USA. Random hacks that innovate are encouraged. There are plenty of other obscure platforms that are used, and yet very few people use FPGAs. This is indicative of the difficulty for typical programmers to dive into FPGAs, and it will be a hard problem to solve.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mongodb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mongodb</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/verilog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/verilog</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xilinx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xilinx</a>",1429204490

I think the federal government (Medicare) and hospital administrators need to reevaluate the weight they put on patient satisfaction and the pressure it puts on physicians as well as patient outcomes.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/821288"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/821288</a>",1429204160

That the idea of the roads being car-centric is a fairly recent development in human history. One of my favorite examples is Las Vegas and Moscow, Russia. In the case of Las Vegas they&#x27;ve built entire elevated sidewalks with escalators and elevators. Cars rule in a city where people could, in theory, walk between casinos, restaurants, etc. In Moscow there are many many large sections of the city where the only way to cross the street is to go through the subway. On the upside that city has a pretty great subway system, so it makes some sense.<p>Either way the point of the article (which a shocking number of people in the comments here and on the article missed) is that it&#x27;s this chicken and the egg problem that needs to be addressed.",1429204134

9389277,comment,9385738,9387359,0,0,scott00,,,"So, not a teacher, but I have a lot of close friends who are teachers; this post is mostly informed by what they&#x27;ve told me about their experiences. First, I would say that segregation by ability is common in high school, but uncommon in elementary school. It can go either way in middle school.<p>So, in my mind, your question is mainly asking if increased amounts of differentiated instruction could benefit elementary school students. I&#x27;ve definitely heard way more about the difficulty of dealing with poorly behaved students than the difficulty of dealing with well-behaved, but low achieving students. That suggests segregating not along ability lines but rather along behavior/self-control lines.<p>If you run with that idea, and keep class sizes the same for well-behaved children and poorly behaved children, the &quot;good&quot; kids would probably benefit, but the &quot;bad&quot; classrooms would be completely out of control; in effect you would be completely writing those kids off at a very early age. Depending on the capability of the teachers and the difficulty of the student population, I  personally think that might actually be a socially optimal use of resources. However, that is a very controversial opinion, and there are a whole lot of people who would not agree with me on that (and most of my teacher friends are among them).<p>If you go to very large classes for &quot;good&quot; kids, and very small classes for &quot;bad&quot; kids (say ~50 kids vs ~10), you have a different set of problems. A class of 50 8 year olds can get pretty hard to control, even if they&#x27;re well-behaved 8 year olds. Plus, most schools don&#x27;t have the facilities to accommodate classes that size. You can bet parents aren&#x27;t going to be that pleased to have their kids in huge classes. And even if more individual attention is what the &quot;bad&quot; kids need, you still have the problem that you&#x27;ve labeled the bad kids as bad; they&#x27;ll figure it out and it will probably have adverse affects on those kids&#x27; development. That may offset any benefit you&#x27;re getting from the smaller class size in the &quot;bad&quot; population.<p>So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s actually the slam dunk it might seem from a casual analysis.",1429204053

9389260,comment,9386994,9389089,0,0,jblow,,,"I could type up a thorough explanation, but it would take about an hour, and I have a lot to do. It is actually not a bad idea to do such a write-up, but I don&#x27;t think the appropriate venue for it is an ephemeral post on Hacker News ... I&#x27;d rather blog it somewhere that&#x27;s more suitable for long-term reference.<p>But I&#x27;ll drop a few hints. First of all, nobody is talking about running interrupts at 48kHz. That is complete nonsense.<p>The central problem to solve is that you have two loops running and they need to be coordinated: the hardware is running in a loop generating samples, and the software is running in a (much more complicated) loop consuming samples. The question is how to coordinate the passing of data between these with minimal latency and maximum flexibility.<p>If you force things to fill fixed-size buffers before letting the software see them (say, 480 samples or whatever), then it is easy to see problems with latency and variance: simply look at a software loop with some ideal fixed frame time T and look at what happens when T is not 100Hz. (Let&#x27;s say it is a hard 60Hz, such as on a current game console). See what happens in terms of latency and variance when the hardware is passing you packets every 10ms and you are asking for them every 16.7ms.<p>The key is to remove one of these fixed frequencies so that you don&#x27;t have this problem. Since the one coming from the hardware is completely fictitious, that is the one to remove. Instead of pushing data to the software every 10ms, you let the software pull data at <i>whatever rate it is ready to handle that data</i>, thus giving you a system with only one coarse-grained component, which minimizes latency.<p>You are not running interrupts at 48kHz or ten billion terahertz, you are running them <i>exactly when the application needs them</i>, which in this case is 16.7ms (but might be 8.3ms or 10ms or a variable frame rate).<p>You don&#x27;t have to recompute any of the filters in your front-end software based on changing amounts of data coming in from the driver. The very suggestion is nonsense; if you <i>are</i> doing that, it is a clear sign that your audio processing is terrible because there is a dependency between chunk size and output data. It should be obvious that your output should be a function of the input waveform only. To achieve this, you just save up old samples after you have played them, and run your filter over those plus the new samples. None of this has anything to do with what comes in from the driver when and how big.<p>Edit:
I should point out, by the way, that this extends to purely software-interface issues. Any audio issue where the paradigm is &quot;give the API a callback and it will get called once in a while with samples&quot; is terrible for multiple reasons, at least one of which is explained above. I talked to the SDL guys about this and to their credit they saw the problem immediately and SDL2 now has an application-pull way to get samples (I don&#x27;t know how well it is supported on various platforms, or whether it is just a wrapper over the thread thing though, which would be Not Very Good.)",1429203936

- The curse of overprovisioning: Borg and many other systems rely on reservation which are systematically exaggerated by users. Right sizing these reservations is one way to go beyond the 40-50% usage shown in the Borg paper (see fig 12). A promising way of doing this is Christina Delimitrou&#x27;s work using classification techniques (see <a href=""http://goo.gl/vFf8oN"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/vFf8oN</a>)
- Oversubscription using better isolation mechanisms): this is what the Borg paper calls resource reclamation. Take unused (but reserved) resources from priority jobs and use them for best effort analytics. David Lo (<a href=""http://web.stanford.edu/~davidlo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.stanford.edu/~davidlo/</a>) has a very interesting paper coming up on how to coordinate cpu sets, cache partitioning, Linux TC, RAPL/DVFS (power management) to run websearch clusters at >90% by packing them with analytics without causing ANY glitch on search. And that is Google search.<p>There are definitely more interesting. Exciting times.",1429203678

That&#x27;s how these product managers make these decisions, they look at the data and if a feature is used <1% of the time they kill it because, they say, they need the interface to be as simple as possible.<p>The problem with that is a statistical logic one. The majority of people will use a rare <1% feature occasionally. When the feature isn&#x27;t there the user finally realizes how dumbed down the product is and that it doesn&#x27;t fit their needs. Even if it fit their need for years it let them down when they needed it most. The PM will respond that it wasn&#x27;t worth it to have the feature uglyfying the interface for years just so it was available that one time.",1429203659

Pharo uses Filetree which export source to files and makes commits , pulls , pushs etc. Gitfiletree allows filetree to be managed by git from inside Pharo without the use of a terminal but you can still use the terminal if that is your thing. I explain filetree, git and github in this video<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNYDtO0cE&list=PLqbtQ7OkSta0ULYAd7Qdxof851ybh-_m_&index=22"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNYDtO0cE&list=PLqbtQ7OkSt...</a>",1429203604

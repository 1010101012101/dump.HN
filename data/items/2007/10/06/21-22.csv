The only person I know who doesn't use Google search is my grandma, who doesn't use a computer.  In contrast, not even half the people I know my age use facebook, and essentially no one older than me uses it or seems at all likely to ever bother.   <p><i>Its a platform that allows a kind of lightweight, asynchronous and with easy opt-outs and opt-ins, shared online experience. I think it actually threatens to become the internet for a lot of people.</i><p>It's not there yet, though.  The login requirement is a barrier.  The interface is still pretty complicated and it's not much faster(if it's faster at all) than its competitors.  There's still nothing so compelling that people can't break a Facebook habit if they want to.<p>Facebook has a lot of potential, and of course millions of users count for something, but it's not a Google and really doesn't seem to be headed that way.",1191707982

Especially when they're well expressed and come from someone who agrees with them 90% of the time anyway.",1191707940

64214,comment,63702,64155,0,0,rkts,,,"> They supposed to be used for exceptional results that cannot be handled locally.<p>The point is that there is no such thing.  Exceptional situations should <i>always</i> be handled locally, and by locally I mean on the very next line.  If they can't be, then the program should stop running.<p>Writing code with exceptions is very hard to get right.  Not checking return values is just stupid.",1191706840
64213,comment,63912,64086,0,0,vikram,,,"The only way most companies can measure people is by the amount of time that they put in. So if one is not at the office it can be very hard for the manager to work out how much people are worth. This is because most managers can't work out what programmers do anyway.<p>So though people who work from home might get twice as much done. They still won't very far up in the organisation. Which demoralises them. Plus if they work as part of a team which works face-2-face, they still spend a lot of time working out what's happened at work.",1191706680

64209,comment,63617,63791,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Hell... I have some of the symptoms in that article, and I'm only 23. I don't think the ability to recall random strangers' names or remember why I walked into a room really affects my coding, though. I would argue that the older I get, the better I get at remembering the things that really matter (big picture stuff, the project I'm working on, etc.) and forgetting the rest.<p>Also, here's a counterexample, a checkers player who was basically undefeated well into his 60s:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Tinsley"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Tinsley</a><p>Presumably he had to play several matches against younger, ""sharper"" opponents.",1191706162

64200,comment,64147,64147,0,0,npk,,,"The grad school choice was easy for me, I was 100% sure I wanted to be an academic.  Also, grad school in the physical sciences is a little different than in CS (i think.)  Here are some things to consider:  Are you currently doing research in a good research lab?  Do you like it?  Are there any professors/groups that you are ecstatic about working with?  Do these profs/groups have funding for a grad student?<p>If you answer yes to <i>all</i> of the above, then you have done enough due diligence to make an educated decision, go work for the groups you identified.  So you know, I answered yes to all these questions, and I still hate grad school ;)<p>Fundamentally, and we are all guilty of this, we think that the most important problems to solve are obvious from the get go.  Worst, we think important problems must be personally interesting.  Try another approach.  Solve a problem that's interesting to you, better than anyone else, see where it takes you.  The only reason a phd is fun is cause you get to do that..  It's not clear that these style-over-substance startups do not offer you the same opportunity.",1191704799

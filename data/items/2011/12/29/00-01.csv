There is also an EPOC effect for cardio, it's just not as pronounced as weight training. (but it's not much less, either, more like 5% less)<p>The bigger issue is there is no way for the casual exerciser to measure EPOC, whereas it's straightforward to measure calorie intake and calorie expenditure. Thus, it's not very useful as a weight loss aid, because you have no idea how much of an afterburn effect really occurs. If you can't measure it yourself, it's effectively broscience, even if there is real science behind the idea.",1325120399

3402093,comment,3400508,3400897,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"There's a lot of crossover in my understanding of fitness (diet/nutrition, strength, cardio), and of willpower and volition in its various states.  Many food/fitness issues are born of concepts very similar to addiction (and heavily pursued by food marketers and advertisers under similar grounds).<p>I've tried going very low carb, and found the experience quite dissatisfying.  Cognitive, strength, and cardio abilities all suffered.  My best bet is to stick to a small quantity of whole grains (rolled or steel-cut oats generally) in the morning, some fruit and vegetables through the day, most carbs post-workout.<p>As to cutting the volitional element of diet control, a number of experiences, ranging from ""Supersize Me"" to other readings and experiences, made me stop considering a wide range of alleged ""food products"" as food, and instead, seeing them as toxins.  The choice is then not one of ""do you want to eat this food"" but ""do you want to eat this poison"".  It makes saying ""no"" much easier.  Practicing a ""thanks, but no"" doesn't hurt either.<p>It also helps (and HN often assists in this) to realize that a great deal of modern ""culture"" and media are dedicated to polluting your choice-discrimination mechanisms.  Avoiding commercial media (TV, radio, malls, etc.) drastically reduces your exposure to mental toxins as well. Yes, ""gamification"", ""viral spread"", ""addictive experience"", and all that.<p>Shopping also becomes the one time you're really having to make choices.  I avoid stores that carry mostly junk, have my ""regular items"" I stock up on, and stick to them.  Treats become nuts, dried fruits, dates, and figs.<p>Scheduling a regular time to be at the gym (or wherever else you exercise) is another key.<p>Stick to all of this:  avoid the bad foods, feed your brain/body enough slow-burning glucose to keep it happy, avoid distractive influences, keep your home and personal environments free of temptations, and you'll spare yourself a lot of the need of having to exhaust willpower. Though as with any muscle, I suspect that occasional exercise with periods of recovery strengthens it in the long run.",1325119803

I can completely understand if the copier claims they alone made the image, but these sort of claims can be and are disproven by the original author or other people who have seen the original work and are sometimes removed thanks to current copyright laws (at least in the USA.) Tools like TinEye or Google Images can also help find the original image.<p>However people do generally  attribute images; those who don't (and don't claim the image as their own) are only ""stealing"" potential profit from the author, which can easily be prevented by either selling it to some group, like a newspaper or magazine, or not uploading the image to the internet at all.<p>Aesthetically, watermarks can look pretty gnarly, but this of course depends on the person and the watermark.

Papers rarely publish all they know, as sometimes it's a better bet to keep quiet on something juicy to avoid burning bridges. Papers are also routinely asked to sit on a story, or bury it outright, as a favor in exchange for access.<p>A leak of all New York Times emails would probably include a lot of the same sort of content and people I'm imagining in a Stratfor leak. The SNR wouldn't be nearly as favorable, since the Times has a much more public profile and a much broader scope than just global events. Stratfor's specific focus makes it much likelier that any given source, or any given chum of the CEO, has said something via email that could be pretty powerful, were it disclosed.

I see a couple of these blog posts along the lines of ""well my 6 months are up, I'm outta here!"".  That seems like such a tragedy to me.<p>I've been to Chile before, Santiago is a wonderful city. We had only a few weeks in the country, but in that time we saw a little of the area and even went to Easter Island (which is part of Chile.)  There's whole regions of Chile we didn't get to see, such as the high desert, punta arenas, etc.<p>SU Chile gets you a 1 year visa, and se we're planning to spend at least a year in Chile (they said they can help with renewal so we might stay 2 years even.) And while we're going to be working really hard on our startup I can't imagine a better place to do it than a county where stepping out of your door to go to dinner and suddenly you're on a foreign vacation for the evening!<p>I hope everyone whose considering going to Chile will also consider staying longer than 6 months.  If your startup is internet or software based, you don't really need to come back to your home country right away, do you?<p>But looking at just that visa, there are so many moving parts we have to get aligned to get that visa.  Its really no big deal in terms of visas on the global scale-- imagine trying to get a 1 year visa that lets you work in the USA!  Much, much harder.   So, bureaucracy is involved in the visa, and the reimbursement process.<p>The thing is, TANSTAAFL (there ain't no such thing as a free lunch).  They don't take equity, but they want you to help the with their project.  That's fine, part of our business plan is helping build a community of independant startups anyway, we've got no problem doing that.  But that's how we ""pay our way"".<p>With expenses, every expense is different, and so, of course, some expenses might be approved for some people but not for others-- some people might forget to get receipts or might make an other error.  The bigger question is whether the rules are straightforward, comprehensible and clear. Or not.<p>Maybe it would be better if the program worked as a grant, and they gave each startup $6,500 a month just as a check to spend as the startup wishes.  The thing is, that would run the risk of scary stories like ""These drunken 20 year olds from Amsterdam came to Chile and bought drugs with government money!!!"" (or maybe not, don't know if they have tabloids in chile.)  So, government money, government bureaucracy.<p>I havent' heard anyone say that they were cheated by SU Chile... and with any reimbursement system, you have to expect there will be imperfect coverage.  Someone else commented that they spent $7-8k over the 6 months (with the rest covered by SU Chile reimbursements) -- that's a hell of a low burn rate!<p>So, maybe you could theoretically live in Chile on the $40k and have it all be reimbursed, but expecting that seems silly.",1325118183

I'm not particularly interested in the results.<p>What I know is that there have been few serious bodybuilders (the guys who are most interested in training efficiency in developing more muscle mass) over the past 75-100 years who've advocated isometrics.  Your standout oddballs are Herschell Walker (and he pimps calisthenics, not isometrics) and Charles Atlas (a modified ""dynamic tension"" model, not strictly isometric). There are occasional iso advocates, but they're well off the mainstream.<p>So:  if you're currently untrained, and you don't have any limitations on full-ROM training modalities, your best bet is to do a freeweight, compound-movement, whole-body training program, about 3x weekly.  This will do the most to add muscle to your body with the least amount of training and effort.  Standard modifications would be to substitute a two-part split and 4x schedule, possibly 5x, if you have the time for it.  Training volume, recovery needs, and training frequency won't let you go much beyond this.  <i>And</i> retain an advantace over the first option.<p>If you're interested in disputing this, I'd encourage you to research the claim yourself (it's a pretty conservative and widely accepted one), find its critics, and judge their arguments and data on their merits.  I'm not particularly interested in the question at this point.",1325117157

I love the ability to ignore memory allocation in Lua, and I'm annoyed that I have to deal with thinking about it, but at least it's pretty straightforward.<p>Also, depending on the game, you can nuke your Lua allocation every level/section/other segment, allocating Lua memory from a memory pool. That can also help a lot with fragmentation.<p>But if you're doing a game that's one continuous experience, you have no choice but to be careful with managing memory. Again, it CAN be done from within Lua (think object pools), and that could be easier than porting to C++. And with LuaJIT 2, it would likely be fast enough in that case.",1325116846

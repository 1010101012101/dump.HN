1753050,comment,1752440,1752662,0,0,kaiserama,,,"As an aside AFAIK many financial advisors have used aggregation services (CashEdge, ByAllAccounts, uMonitor), which require their clients to log in and provide essentially the same access to their financial institutions, for quite some time.  I believe Yodlee was one of the first to make their aggregation services available to a consumer based business vs. an advisor.<p>In addition the onus of primary security (username/password) rests with the service provider (Yodlee), if I understand things correctly Mint would only store a unique identifier to access a user's information via a Yodlee API call.  So after transaction data has been scrubbed it would be extremely difficult for a hacker to access a user's bank account information from Mint.<p>You're still very much correct if Yodlee has a security slip, but their business depends on securing that information.",1286125189

Basically my suggestion is retain your UK residence and take extended ""vacations"" in countries you want to visit - it'll be a lot less of a hassle then trying to immigrate.</i><p>You will want to be very, <i>very</i> careful with that. I'm neither a lawyer nor an accountant, but the tax rules for US citizens are very different from pretty much everyone else. Tax authorities will generally <i>not</i> be happy if you try to pay no tax locally and send it all home. The rule is typically that you pay tax where you spend the most number of days of that tax year. No idea what happens when tax years for natural persons don't overlap (UK has April-April, many countries have calendar years) - in my case I didn't earn any money in the interim so it wasn't an issue.<p>Within the EU, you'll probably need to register your new residence as the, or one of the company's offices where its business is conducted. You don't need to register it as a business of that country, though, unless you're a sole trader. Any salary or dividends you pay yourself will usually be subject to local taxes, social security, health insurance and possibly other fees. Your accountant(s) will need to tell you where the business pays tax on its profits.<p>You may also require a permit for operating a business in that country. I did (UK citizen, located in Austria), and although software development is usually not regulated in the way the medical, legal and other professions are, I did require a certificate of any record on the UK Police National Computer, or rather lack of any record. This took almost 2 months and cost 10 pounds. I managed to sweet-talk the bureaucrat in Austria into not requiring an official translation, but the rule is that you do - this will add extra cost and time.<p>You may also require a residence permit, even within the EU. That too tends to be a mere formality, but usually they want proof of earning enough to sustain yourself. Not a problem if you're a UK limited company, you'll be used to your income being a matter of public record anyway. I didn't need this in Vienna, but a German friend in another State (Lower Austria) got an unpleasant visit from the immigration police.<p>UK->EU specific, but: you can forget your E111 for anything but emergencies. You'll probably be forced to get local health insurance (in Austria they write to you and bill you as soon as you register the business) anyway.<p>Hopefully, you'll encounter less hassle - Austria is exceptionally hostile towards the self employed, and taxes are insane.",1286122615

With FB, it's sort of the other way around, where you have all these people you can get infront of, but the demand is more opaque, and you're really searching for it instead of capturing established channels like with Google search terms.<p>All of this is really just chatter, only FB can know how to monetize FB, because they have the data, they have the information required to make a decision on what to do, and chances are, like with Google (remember in the early days they had no business model), they'll figure it out through just sheer luck or chance.

He has an idea very much worth spreading. Hell, they even let me speak at TED, so please take a minute or two to nominate Salman Khan here on TED's speaker nomination form: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/nominate/speaker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/nominate/speaker</a><p>And if you've got another minute, nominate Paul Graham, too!<p>(edit: I'm an employee of Y Combinator, making PG my boss, but I'd nominate him regardless of that fact.)",1286121810

However, in the case of money, it's a little clearer: the only difference between giving someone extra money when they have another child and replacing money they spend on an extra child is what you say about it.<p>Now, it's true that what you say about it can have a real effect on choices and outcomes, but we don't really know enough to reliably predict what that effect is in the general case, so for practical purposes, I think we're better off assuming that the effects are negligible.",1286121774

The auto-labeling was awesome for watching my accounts - you generally only had to label/tag a business once.<p>I vastly, vastly prefer Wesabe's auto-labeling system to Mint's POS labeling. On Mint, any transaction from Chili Ave (a major road) gets autolabeled as Chili's, the restaurant - and so on. It makes Mint worse than useless for me.

Perhaps purely by coincidence is that true, with Hemingway winning the nobel prize a few years before this letter was mailed, and thompson actively copied heminway's work, as well as several other novels, in order to learn more about writing style, though he never published any plagiarized work.<p>Hemingway was a traditional, fiction, novelist and focused on his characters. Thompson defied (edit: was defined, oops) 100s of years of traditional writing (both novel and newspaper) by inventing so called 'gonzo' journalism. The man openly included his own personal life directly into all of this work, including this letter. He also, never worked in canada.<p>While I hold both men in high regard, the only parallels between these two men are the facts they both were journalists and authors (and drunks), since that's true for almost every published journalist, it's a thin comparison at best.",1286121610

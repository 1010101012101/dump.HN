Bringing up the mortgage crisis is out of left field.  Paul's statement regarded the comparison of today's tech startup market with that of the late 90s.<p>Is Mr. Shazer making a new comparison of today's tech startup market to the mortgage crisis?  I'm not sure.  There's no <i>there</i> there.<p>> <i>Paul, JP Morgan just closed on a $1.2 billion fund for new tech startups. And many other banks are following suit, because that’s what banks do, just like they wear them. Carlyle and other buyout firms are swallowing up VC firms like a toothless prostitute. So, a little more than a few guys like Yuri Milner and Zuckerberg.</i><p>Bandwagon != bubble.  It could be that the tech startup market is still undervalued.  Just noting that banks are investing in it does not make it a bubble.<p>Of course there is the question of bias.  Mr. Graham clearly stands to benefit from higher startup valuations.  Tell us something we don't know and with less hyperbole.<p>> <i>There is a bubble. And it’s getting bigger.</i><p>An effectively bald though entirely anticipated assertion.",1298663991

Most critical among that was to make it clear that we are NOT trying to compete with Jira, Redmine or Bugzilla. We're a visual issue tracking tool, not a bug tracker as such. Thought I'd also mention we're coming over to the US in a couple of weeks to show this off at a few events as part of the Aussie Startmate program.\nWe've gone away and redone our landing page completely, and have worked hard at repositioning ourselves to stand out amongst other bug tools. Hopefully we've succeeded at making this differentiation (thoughts welcome).<p>In addition to a redesign, we've also done some thinking about pricing, and have come up with a model we think works for small teams (our initial target). Basically we're charging $5 per project and $5 per team member. Your team members can work across any number of projects (i.e. 2 people on 5 projects is still just 2 people), so you don't get any double charges for those people. We have a number of ideas with support end-users and clients at no change. These groups will use a cut-down interface, faster and easier to use.<p>We're now looking at how we can position ourselves not as ""bug tracker"" but as ""UI tracker"" or ""design tracker"" or something. We're trying to get ourselves somewhere between a bug tracker, user feedback tool and QA tool. So we're kind of stuck on what exactly to call it! Suggestions welcome!",1298663854

Sometimes improving means removing as well and sometimes it does mean adding, or just changing something. It depends.<p>That said, just because adding something makes the product better, does NOT mean it always make sense. There was a story about another company who, because of customer feedback, ended up building a bunch of features into one of their products. Turns out, only a small minority of their userbase even cared to use those features and that the mass majority were fine with the features that were already there. In hindsight, they said it was wasted time and resources and really didn't add much to the bottom line.<p>Also, rather than believe what you're doing is ""better"" or an ""improvement"", things should be split tested and verified as to whether you should spend time and resources.

However, these cases have no more force of law in modern courts than does the Dred Scot decision (though that ruling too is cited on more than a few occasions by FIJA adherents).

Some people say that it's an entirely new thing,  the ""study of the artificial""<p>Personally my impression is that work in description logics,  databases and such has been held back by a focus on mathematics.  Roughly,  the more powerful a logic system gets,  the harder it is to 'compute' about it,  both in the sense of using computational resources and in the sense that no sound and complete algorithm may even be available.<p>On the other hand,  the real world requires us to represent facts like ""Captain Kirk is a person is the Star Trek universe"" and ""Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God"",  ""The identity of Deep Throat was unknown to most people in 1993"",  etc.  For that we need highly descriptive representations.<p>On the other hand,  we know that people and animals are quite capable of various sorts of modal reasoning.  People aren't good at solving arbitrary problems with general structures,  but they seem to have a bunch of heuristics that can deal with all of the problems that are actually in place.<p>Perhaps a scientific approach can be experimental,  and not be so concerned with problems that ~might~ happen,  but as an engineer I'm afraid the term 'science' is something that can be appropriated for the fashion of day,  as in 'scientific socialism'.",1298661595

That's probably all you need to not be a 'douche bag coder' who causes more problems than they solve<p>- get into web programming. Grok HTML, it's quite simple. Next read Transcending CSS, it might take a month but eventually you'll 'get it'. Then work out how to do events and DOM manipulation with JavaScript (make things happen as the user interacts with the page). You can glue on some cargo cult jQuery here :-). THEN study Ajax - follow some of the tutorials on YouTube or iTunesU. It's not really complex it's just bitty and confusing at first (basically you create an XHR object on the page which acts as a halfway house for data going to and from the server without refreshing the whole browser page). Then finally choose a backend system like Ruby/Rails or Python/Django or ASP.NET or PHP and practice doing stuff with it.

All the code is completely commented and I keep finding ways to make the thing better (or at least I think I am).<p>Does anyone else ever do this kind of thing? When do you say it's ""complete"" and move on to the next project? This extension works and works well, and has been tested all kinds of ways. I'm not the type of person to half ass a project and this is for a very large company and I really don't feel like making the company I work for nor my self look bad.",1298660984

2263369,comment,2259755,2261660,0,0,jonknee,,,"> And Google is one step closer to tracking everything everyone does on every website.<p>As long as you link the right files (make sure you specify the specific version and not use the one to give the lastest), there are very long expires headers and Google will have no idea the vast majority of your users ever visited. A user just needs to visit one site using the same version of Google hosted jQuery and they won't have to download it again when visiting another site.<p>> Hosting your own 23kb jQuery file does not cost that much. Actually practically nothing. Not in terms of bandwidth and neither in terms of perceived performance. Unless you are hosting your website on a 36.6kbps modem, host your own. Do the web some good.<p>People aren't using Google CDN for the cost, but for the performance. A high percentage of user will have the file cached already, so the performance gain is quite significant. Doubly so in a mobile environment.",1298660966

If you want to learn Linux, do something that involves some server side work: get some cheap web hosting account (or one almost for free on nearlyfreespeech as long as you don't have traffic) and start compiling programs from source, set up mod_rewrite, etc. etc. etc. Otherwise get a cheap computer, install Linux and configure everything as you want, hunting for answers on forums.

More important is to take classes in math, because math is a lot harder to teach yourself.<p>Once you learn a little math (say discrete, number theory, and linear algebra), I think you will probably have the mental toolset to think scientifically and learn a lot of the computer science on your own.<p>A basic class in data structures and algorithms might be nice because it will give you homework and fill in some gaps you might have from teaching yourself, but after that, computer science learning <i>can</i> be largely self directed. Automata is a really nice class to have if you can find it, because it ties in with the math, but it's not necessary for most industry programming.<p>I never took classes in optimal search algorithms, computer vision, or statistical programming, but I've done work in each of these three things. I taught myself as much game programming, graphics and user interface stuff as I learned in classes. I had classes in compilers, languages, automata, AI, robotics... these were all great, and not things I could easily have taught myself, but they were also specialized, and haven't been so directly relevant afterwards.<p>Linux is all experience; I haven't been on the job long, and I'm still learning it. Earlier this week I found out that I was running some of our servers to max CPU usage because I left greps running on them (didn't know the difference between suspending a process and putting it in the background)!<p>Quitting is also totally cool if you can manage it. I used to be a graduate mathematician. It was very hard to figure out that this wasn't what I was supposed to be doing with my life... but figuring it out and leaving was the best thing I ever did. I would have been very unhappy. Now I'm happy! I was also extremely fortunate to have a father who was happy to support me switching fields. Your post reminds me how important that was, and makes me grateful enough that I think I should go call him.<p>Good luck, and... uh... <small voice> a hug.",1298660441

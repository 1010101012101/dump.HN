5309459,comment,5308057,5309095,2,0,ithkuil,,,"The topic wasn't whether nukes are better or worst than other means of killing a comparable amount of civilians, but that our brain is shaped in such a way that we can easily justify that kind of action because ""they"" did worse, and why this, very natural thing, is dangerous.<p>Personal revenge and punishment has already an interesting amount of counter arguments. But when we begin to lift this issue up to whole populations/ethnic groups, the thing starts to get out of control.<p>Collective guilt and responsibility and punishment were the same actors behind the very atrocities we were condemning and fighting.<p>In the hearts of many people, the Jews deserved what happened to them because they were the alleged cause of their problems and misery (and they needed an enemy, someone to blame). And it was way easier for German people to not feel empathy for all the Jewish neighbors disappearing once they thought of them as ""them"", as carrying a collective guilt, regardless of individuals.<p>So, I'm not here to discuss who is worse.
But sometimes, as I struggle to understand how it's possible have had so many millions of complacent people, assisting, giving power to cruel dictators, sometimes I have a glimpse of how is this feeling, each time I happen to think ""well, they deserve it"".",1362232493

It remains today a classic book still widely used - better than even most more recent books on the same topic. Whilst its use of the 'left-right' thing is obviously fundamentally flawed scientifically, in the book it is more or less a model presented to the reader in describing how to 'think' to aid in drawing - which mental processes to turn on/off, focus on or ignore. This more practical side of the book has proved very helpful and effective to its readers and is the real achievement which has led to the book's enduring success. The success of this has however led to the propagation of the 'left-right' thing which the book does basically claim is a scientific basis for everything described.<p>My only point in saying this is that there's complexity to stories like this - ideas can be helpful even if the scientific base they pretend to be based on is incorrect.",1362231917

Design is more fragmented than web services and thus easier to break into. If Google + design -> Cupertino while Apple has only to master ""web services"" the war has already been won.

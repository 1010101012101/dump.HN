What the heck does that mean?<p>The FAQ is four paragraphs long, of which only two sentences  are at all meaningful.<p>How about just having the front page say: ""SNiPiTRON is a way to build research projects based on the web pages you capture. Then you can share and discuss your research with friends, colleagues, co-workers, etc."" Even this is too wordy and could be cut down.<p>Why even bother building it if 90% of the people who get to the site are going to hit the back button within the first ten seconds? heh.",1174181960

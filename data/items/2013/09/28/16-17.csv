6462334,comment,6462056,6462056,2,0,benaiah,,,"Suggestions:<p>- Autofocus the url bar, if this is possible. Make the search field the first tab field (it&#x27;s currently the second).<p>- Do a live fuzzy filtering of my webapps, not a submit-based search. This might work better if you had the list of results in a dropdown from the search box (think how Sublime shows its command pallette. If you don&#x27;t know what that is, see the third animation at <a href=""http://www.sublimetext.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sublimetext.com/</a>), instead of taking over the main body of the page.<p>- If I press Enter from the search box, open the top result that&#x27;s currently showing.<p>These three changes allow for the workflow Ctrl-T, Tab if necessary, type fuzzy search for app name, press enter. Otherwise it&#x27;s faster just to use the URL bar.<p>- You should show the URL of the shortcuts when editing the list of shortcuts, and preferably giving an option to turn on the domain on the main view.<p>EDIT:<p>- I would suggest making all my currently selected apps stored in localStorage, and using appCache for the page, if you&#x27;re not already. If you want people to use this heavily, it&#x27;ll need to load <i>fast</i>. The directory you can just load from a server, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to wait for a response if I&#x27;m on a bad connection and I want to open a web app.<p>- Is there a way to load in your data without redirecting the New Tab page? Currently, the way you have it set up breaks the Ctrl-T, type-url flow that I use <i>constantly</i>, and I imagine many other people do too. I know it used to be possible to take over the new tab page without changing the url - did the update break this?<p>EDIT: changed the first suggestion.",1380387557

6462314,comment,6461494,6461968,10,0,kafkaesque,,,"And this was my initial reaction when I started reading his presentation. I made that &quot;Huh?&quot; face. I kept reading, but half-way through, I skipped portions of it.<p>My problem: his presentation sounds too contrived. My background is in literature; meaning, I am obsessed with literature and reading and its where most of my knowledge rests.<p>I love Thoreau. I&#x27;m a hiker. I&#x27;m learning to program. I really like computers and technology. But I rarely, if ever try to unite the two. Sorry, it just doesn&#x27;t work.<p>One things computers try to do is make things scale, as I understand it; understand and organise things with massive computer power. I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad thing.<p>But Thoreau wanted the opposite.<p>I&#x27;m sure the presenter meant well, and his heart was in the right place, but have a close look at the words he uses. They&#x27;re buzzwords to try to relate to an audience who is further apart from Thoreau&#x27;s ideology than he might&#x27;ve wished.<p>He is &quot;rebranding&quot; Thoreau. Thoreau is not a &#x27;content creator&#x27;, because that word has certain connotations nowadays, which do not apply to him. Yes, this might be semantics, but this type of updated/21st century diction to try to relate/appeal to a new audience sounds contrived.<p>I applaud his efforts, because at least Thoreau serves as a way to balance out technologists&#x27; lives.<p>But because he was so extreme, all this sounds like yoga instructors talking about living a better life sipping on their Starbucks coffee and buying expensive Yoga mats.<p>I mean, sure, it&#x27;s really good that you have recognised the worth of many nonmaterialistic things, but you&#x27;re not really helping if most of your life is materialistic. Note I&#x27;m not forcing anyone into doing away with their material- and technology-driven lives.<p>All I&#x27;m saying is Thoreau&#x27;s ideology and the modern person are not compatible, unfortunately. And because of that, all we can do is sit around and study his writings conceptually, abstractly, without gaining the experience he wanted everyone to have. Few of us could stand 2 years of living the way he did, yet the presenter actually feels the need to tell his audience, (I&#x27;m paraphrasing), &quot;Sure! Thoreau ONLY did it for 2 years, and he had mom and sister come out once a week to help!&quot; Um...how long would the average person be able to stand it?<p>The OP says it is easy to take Thoreau out of context, because he is so quotable, yet continues to do this very thing!<p>&quot;Moreover, you must walk like a camel, which is said to be the only beast which ruminates when walking. When a traveler asked Wordsworth&#x27;s servant to show him her master&#x27;s study, she answered, &#x27;Here is his library, his study is out of doors.&#x27;&quot;<p>He doesn&#x27;t mean that you need to go and collect data electronically on people or go on a Google car and photograph every single major street to store it, analyse it, and show it to the world on a computer. If you believe this is what he is saying, this is called &quot;reappropriation&quot;.<p>Lastly, let me quote again from his book titled Walking--a recommended read because it is short, yet illustrates his ideology.<p>&quot;In short, all good things are wild and free. There is something in a strain of music, whether by its wildness, to speak without satire, reminds me of the cries emitted by wild beasts in their native forests. It is so much of their wildness as I can understand. Give me for my friends and neighbors wild men, not tame ones. The wildness of the savage is but a faint symbol of the awful ferity with which good men and lovers meet.&quot;<p>Stop trying to tame Thoreau&#x27;s ideas. Let&#x27;s not try to make ourselves feel better by saying we have some things in common with him or stretching his ideas.<p>I go into nature to get away from my computers and society and everyone else. It is my own personal struggle or inner conflict. I don&#x27;t need to try to convince others of how good we can have it if we just adopted Thoreau&#x27;s ideas, because by our current standards, he would be considered an extremist.<p>In that same passage above, Thoreau goes on to talk about how domesticated animals need to reassert themselves.<p>Please, let&#x27;s not dilute Thoreau just to make us feel better, because (1) most people who don&#x27;t agree with him will not feel better about it; and (2) most people who want to agree with him will find that they cannot adopt his ideas or lifestyle. I think the HN crowd is too smart to adopt some half-assed idea. They&#x27;d rather come up with their own idea or take on how to find a balance between technology, nature, and tackling startup culture.",1380387132
6462313,comment,6461960,6461960,4,0,TheLegace,,,"&quot;To Mr. Lazaridis, a life-long tinkerer who had built an oscilloscope and computer while in high school, the iPhone was a device that broke all the rules. The operating system alone took up 700 megabytes of memory, and the device used two processors. The entire BlackBerry ran on one processor and used 32 MB. Unlike the BlackBerry, the iPhone had a fully Internet-capable browser. That meant it would strain the networks of wireless companies like AT&T Inc., something those carriers hadnt previously allowed. RIM by contrast used a rudimentary browser that limited data usage.&quot;<p>I said, How did they get AT&T to allow [that]? Mr. Lazaridis recalled in the interview at his Waterloo office.  Its going to collapse the network. And in fact, some time later it did.<p>You have to give them at least a little bit of forgiveness for having to deal with AT&T/Verizon for so many years.

I have 12 years experience with PHP, it&#x27;s my primary language, I know it&#x27;s got pros and cons, I accept it for what it is and work around it.

No... I have been playing around with node.js for 2 years now, long enough to know it pretty well, and yet I can still code circles around node.js with PHP.. 12 years using this language as a primary, it&#x27;d take me at LEAST 4 years to even get close to the scale of how well I can code in PHP.<p>It&#x27;s just not feasible for me to just up and leave PHP for something &quot;better&quot; based on a few cons and other peoples opinions.",1380387107

Plus, you have to factor in time spent doing data entry. I think these factors combine to make for a life-time limit on the number of entries. Suppose you use SuperMemo for 20 years (7300 days) at 2 hours per day (14600 hours) and 100 new entries per day. That&#x27;s only 1.4 million unique entries.. (this analysis is severely lacking and deserves more thought).<p>Insert here some humbling story about the benefits of improving meta-aspects of how and what you pick to spend time on.

6462198,comment,6461765,6461765,30,0,AnotherDesigner,,,"I&#x27;ve wrote about this a few times on HN before. You guys like to downvote me every time I do but here we go again ...<p>Good designers, the ones you want if this is important to you, don&#x27;t do contests. We have families to feed and bills to pay. &quot;Winning&quot; a popularity contest, not based on substance but instead on style, doesn&#x27;t allow us to support ourself and our families doing our work. So, who are the designers doing these contests? Well, besides the large number of completely untrained laypeople, it&#x27;s mostly students wanting beer money and portfolio pieces. And lets face it, most designers need many years beyond school before they&#x27;re anything approaching &quot;good&quot; at their craft. Those years are spent doing grunt work with increasing amounts of responsibility under senior designers, art directors, creative directors, whatever.<p>My second point about that is how rare it is to win a contest. Designers know that they&#x27;re often designing blind here. They could spend all the time in the world creating the perfect brand and the client could choose something else because they don&#x27;t like the color blue or they&#x27;re scared of clown logos or whatever. Point is, the client is often hardly objective in these situations and the designers know this. What does this mean in practicality? They are going to put as little effort as possible in to this because the chances of reward are small. Personally, I&#x27;d love to see the average amount of time spent on these logo entries. I bet most of them are well under 10 minutes.<p>Legal issues. I&#x27;ll skim here because I don&#x27;t have my links handy but most of these contest websites have been caught with stolen logos in their submissions. Companies have been sued for using these logos from contest websites costing them thousands of dollars they didn&#x27;t expect. It happens and when the &quot;designer&quot; is some anonymous guy across the world, you have no recourse but to pay the fees, lawyer fees and then pay to do your logo all over again. Not to mention the embarrassment to your company when this happens. This stuff is very, very rare for clients working with designers face-to-face.<p>Lastly, when you&#x27;re missing the face-to-face collaboration between designer and client, you&#x27;re also missing most of what makes design &quot;design&quot;, instead of art. The research as well as most of the creative process tends to go missing. The designer starts to view the client as the ones to design for instead of the &quot;user&quot; and as a result, the logo/brand/whatever becomes less effective. And you know what? A lot of important questions go missing ... like what are your plans for the future? What is your strategy to deal with your competitors? Even simple things like &quot;am I making the logo for the company, the product or both&quot; ... changes in company strategy are rarely mentioned in logo contests and this could be the most important question in the world. Logos need to be adaptable to company strategy and that strategy needs to be talking out between company and designer. Often NDAs are signed beforehand, good luck doing that with on a contest.",1380385511

E.g. for learning foreign language vocabulary, anatomy, etc... For this kind of learning it can really save you time, especially when you have 100s or 1000s of items to remember.<p>Using flashcards to learn mathematics, computer programming, physics, or anything requiring more creative or analytical thought is not so useful. For these subjects the number of raw facts required is usually smaller, and the thought processes, concepts and problem solving ability are much more important.<p>However, spaced repetition could be beneficial to these more creative and analytical subjects if it was applied more dynamically. In this case the units to learn could be the rules, laws, concepts which can manifest themselves in different ways <i>within</i> different problems, instead of being static flashcards.

It does not follow that TDD is the cause, nor that TDD is the best of multiple options.<p>Its a well known effect in experimental design - measurement alters what you measure. Get depressed people to watch and talk about a dog video. I can predict that they will be less depressed. Not so much because dog videos are great at reducing depression, but because all of a sudden so much experimental interest is being directed at them. It would be almost <i>churlish</i> to not feel better, if you know what I mean. So, we don&#x27;t design experiments that way - if your hypothesis is that dog videos cure depression, you need to do exactly the same protocol, but with cat videos, or I don&#x27;t know, truck videos, or whatever, so both groups get the same attention, both are trying to reduce their depression and so on (I&#x27;m assuming unblinded here because obviously the TDD paper was unblinded, obviously we have better methods for the depression study than my suggestion here).<p>Kudos for bring empiricism into the discussion, but I do find the paper lacking.<p>I wrote above that I don&#x27;t use TDD yet achieve low defect rates and good design. I think it is because, no matter how you do it, if you focus on those things you will more likely achieve them than if you don&#x27;t. I hypothesize (don&#x27;t be mad!) that TDD works for some simply because it brings the issue of quality to the forefront of their mind. Whereas, I&#x27;m already always thinking &quot;is this line of code going to kill somebody&quot;; I&#x27;ve tried TDD, and it always seemed like it added little to actively inhibited me.

I bought a Kobo mini for $50 because the Nexus 7 wasnt even a good epub reader, and thats having tried four or five different ebook readers on the Nexus 7.<p>This is anecdotal, but I am not sure whether Ill ever buy another Android productregardless of manufacturerand I say that despite feeling the need to stay on top of available technology from a friend/family recommendation perspective. (That, and I do like gadgets, but I&#x27;m much less willing to put up with <i>crap</i> these days.)",1380384021

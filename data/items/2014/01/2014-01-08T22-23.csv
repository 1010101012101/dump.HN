7027463,comment,7025261,7025424,26,0,klibertp,,,"I have only one thing to say here, to you and to all people who are opposed to macros and new languages in general: go learn some more (let&#x27;s say 5) languages and then come back[1]. Don&#x27;t bother before that.<p>Why? Because learning languages gets easier every time you do it. And it opens your eyes to languages&#x27; internal structure, the way languages are composed, which makes using given language effectively easier.<p>So now you know 5 or 8 languages and you discovered a few basic principles behind most of them and you understand how semantic constructs compose and you know about various syntactic representation of any given semantic statement (and the other way around, similar syntactic constructs having different meanings). And you come upon a macro, like the one in the example.<p>You don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s doing - well, you just check the docs and then you know. It&#x27;s as easy as learning what a function does, really. So what was learning those other languages for? It was just to reduce your fear of introducing new syntax for things. You won&#x27;t think &quot;oh, how dangerous this could be&quot; but rather you just start using it, because you do it (change syntactical constructs you use) all the time when you switch between languages.<p>At this stage you can learn some Lisp. And write some real macros. And maybe try Nimrod, which has wonderful macros too. And maybe Rust, which I didn&#x27;t try but I read good things about. After this you&#x27;ll understand what macros are, how they are constructed and how they compose - and write many of your own - and then you look at the class example above and you instinctively[2] know that there has to be a syntax transformer which matches class keyword, a keyword and a block, and then there has to be another transformer, perhaps recursive (like in Scheme) or just iterating over the body (like in defmacro) and that all they do is to add some keywords here and there and a statement or two at the top of the block. In short - you know exactly what to look for and even docs are unneeded, you just take a quick look at a macro source and go on using it happily. Alternatively you can look at generated code and work out macro implementation from it easily, too.<p>I&#x27;m a happy user of LiveScript, and CoffeeScript before that. The only reason for not switching to JS with sweet.js is the fact that I would need to write a whole host of macros by myself, while in CS and especially LS they are already written. And of course modifying their grammar is not <i>that</i> hard either. Had I somehow been unable to use LiveScript, I&#x27;d use sweet.js for sure. What I&#x27;d implement? Probably some kind of &quot;let&quot; statement for sane scope management, a loop macro for iterating over custom collection classes (loop in CL, for/* in Racket, also in others), function currying (partial application) and maybe something like &quot;with&quot; context managers from Python would be among the first. There are many things which are better abstracted with syntax than with (for example) functions.<p>Would the language be JavaScript? Well, hard question, it would be a superset with underlying semantics intact, but it sure wouldn&#x27;t &quot;feel&quot; like JS. But would that matter? Not at all - syntactic extensions would save me a ton of time and I&#x27;m used to many different syntaxes anyway. And I expect anyone who&#x27;d like to work with me to be able to pick up any language in reasonable time - the ability to pick up a few additional syntactic constructs on top of already known language is essentially the same thing, so I think such person would have no problems with it either.<p>Anyway, macros are good; using them is good; the only dangerous thing is having many people implement essentially the same macro over and over again, but I think this could be solved with a sane module system for macros which I read is already planned. There should be more languages rather than less; more exploration of different syntaxes and semantics for things, not less - and macros are one way of making this happen. And if you have problems with learning what a &quot;class name body&quot; does, then I can only refer you to the first paragraph.<p>[1] After I wrote this post I realized I could sound a bit rude. It was not my intention and I&#x27;m sorry if I offended anyone; while written generally, it&#x27;s actually only a description of a road I personally traveled, so obviously YMMV.<p>[2] I know completely nothing about sweet.js in particular, so I&#x27;m completely just guessing.",1389221980

An oddity that voices the raw emotion of the poor, and that glorifies the suboptimal traits that keeps poor people from mobilizing up the ladder in society. To outsiders, that’s all it is.

It feels a bit like Christmas every time new APIs are made stable. The playground comes with its own set of caveats, but I think it is definitely worth it.<p>A lot of the credit for the design has to be given to GitHub. I&#x27;ve been using GitHub for Windows for a while now and, upon taking a closer look, realized that the information it was presenting was, conceptually, very similar to the needs of Streamus. After sending them some e-mails they pointed me towards this blog post of theirs: <a href""https://github.com/blog/1151-designing-github-for-window"" rel""nofollo"">https://github.com/blog/1151-designing-github-for-windows</a> which proved to be extremely helpful. Implementing a &#x27;Metro UI&#x27; theme is super fun -- especially since I&#x27;ve never been much of a &#x27;design guy.&#x27;<p>There&#x27;s a pretty deep-dark secret lurking around the video, but I am working on it. As an extension, Streamus is comprised of a foreground and a background page. The two pages can communicate with each other and with external pages, but only the foreground is visible. Additionally, the foreground is only temporary -- every time focus is lost the entire page is destroyed. As such, if I hosted the YouTube player in the foreground, it would be destroyed when minimized and the music would cease playing.<p>SO, the player is on the background page. &quot;But then how am I watching the video?&quot; Well, with a couple of canvas elements and some clever permissions, I&#x27;m able to implement something similar to what is described here: <a href""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Manipulating_video_using_canva"" rel""nofollo"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Manipulating_v...</a>. I establish a port between the YouTube iframe on the background page and my foreground and pipe the image frame-by-frame to the foreground and re-render it. As you can imagine, this is pretty intense, especially because I can&#x27;t use requestAnimatiomFrame from an invisible page. I&#x27;m still playing around with other possible optimizations, but mostly I need canvas.transferControlToProxy() to be implemented in Google Chrome. You can see the code in question here: <a href""https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/blob/master/src/js/common/view/videoView.j"" rel""nofollo"">https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/blob/maste...</a><p>I&#x27;m not using YouTube mixes for radio mode. It&#x27;s a bit more clever than that. Each video in your stream keeps track of its top 5 related videos by asking YouTube for related videos. This is just the information shown on the RHS when you&#x27;re browsing YouTube. If I have 10 items in my stream -- the pool consists of roughly 50, non-distinct, items. Non-distinct is pretty key here because it provides weighting. If a related video appears 5 times in the pool of 50, it&#x27;s clearly related to a lot of your videos and receives an implicitly greater weight because of it.<p>I also just apply some filters for time, etc. In the future, radio mode will show faded-out &#x27;future picks&#x27; so it&#x27;s not such a mystery what is coming next. You can see the code for all this here: <a href""https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/blob/master/src/js/background/collection/streamItems.js#L34"" rel""nofollo"">https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/blob/maste...</a><p>Let me know if you have any more questions!

Childhood amnesia is well-studied; false memories are equally well-studied and are easily formed; since the former is more probable than an exception to the latter, unless you have additional evidence (which you can&#x27;t really produce), I have no reason to believe your claims.<p>It&#x27;s more probable that you reconstructed those memories from stories told by other people, even if you forgot hearing those stories before remembering the event, than that you&#x27;re an exception to a well-studied and widely documented event.<p>Cognitive psychology is hardly psuedo-science, and in this instance, there were no polls conducted. This was a longitudinal study that took considerable resources to conduct and involved a seemingly well-designed experimental test. The findings are entirely in line with what the rest of the data in the field suggests, so it shouldn&#x27;t be controversial. There were no polls involved, either.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating to believe something that contradicts most available evidence, and it must be even more frustrating to not have a way to demonstrate the truth of such a belief.

To avoid going with anecdotes, I&#x27;ll simply point out that 13% of the homeless population are veterans.  Physical and mental disabilities are quite common and our society has decided to just dump these people on the streets as opposed to helping them.<p>However, then nickthemagicman comes along and makes the implication that stating that a homeless person is disabled is equivalent to stating that the person deserves to be homeless.  That&#x27;s the most offensive thing that I&#x27;ve ever seen on the Internet, and I&#x27;ve been to 4chan.  Just because a person has a disability doesn&#x27;t mean that they don&#x27;t deserve basic human dignity.<p>Though I am descending into anecdote here, my wife was homeless when I met her.  She also has a physical disability which cost her her job and her home.  There was a wonderful government program to help her out of poverty by letting her haul 40lb bags of sand around, but it&#x27;s not much use to a woman who walks with a cane and can&#x27;t carry more than 20lb without needing a week of bed rest.  If we were willing to talk about the root cause, then she&#x27;d be getting the treatment she needs to be healthy again and be happy to carry those 40lb bags.  Unfortunately, the system was designed by bigots like nickthemagicman.  When she applied for disability, she was told that they would only pay for her medical treatment if she agreed to never work again under punishment of jail time.  After all, basic dignities like the joy of contributing to society aren&#x27;t allowed for the disabled.  Just the able bodied homeless, I guess.",1389219638

This failure mode existed up until a few months ago, but has since been fixed. In order to avoid anyone wasting time, we have systems that alert us to potential ToS violations as soon as someone sets up their account. We review these alerts right away, and reach out to users well before they&#x27;ve started accepting payments.<p>2. We never cancel or refund transactions that have even a remote chance of being legitimate. For cases where we have to stop accepting payments for a website because of ToS issues, we&#x27;re always happy to give users as much time as they need to transition off of Stripe if they&#x27;ve already started accepting payments through us.<p>If you&#x27;re aware of recent cases where we haven&#x27;t done this, I&#x27;d really appreciate knowing about them.

I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t have expected anything different, knowing that a real macro system requires support at the language level, and that a retrofit like sweet.js is perforce going to be limited in what it can hope to accomplish.

But I know exactly what my earliest memory was, probably because it was such a significant occasion. I was 3 years old and I remember being in the house and watching my mom come home. She&#x27;d been gone for a day or so and when she came back she had this new baby with her (my brother). I specifically remember her walking into the house: I was behind the sofa peering up at her as she walked in the door, and she had the baby. I was mostly just glad to have my mom back.<p>Touching tale, here&#x27;s where it gets interesting. I remember that, but later (over 30 years later) I discussed this with my parents. Turns out, I&#x27;d been left at a neighbor&#x27;s house while my dad went to fetch her home. They got me afterward. I wasn&#x27;t THERE to see her walk in.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to suggest that your memories are not real. But memory is a strange thing. They do not work like photographs or audio recordings; instead memories are laid down in nerve connections and are refreshed by running through them again. It&#x27;s sort of like having VHS tapes that are brittle: you keep the data by copying them over and over again. Having a photograph to refer to helps to cement it; having a story that goes with it helps you to repeat and thus remember it, and this can happen regardless (as in my case) of whether there was an accurate original &quot;memory&quot;.<p>So perhaps that is the source of your history professor&#x27;s skepticism. Now, he is simply flat-out wrong to dismiss your claims out-of-hand. There is significant individual variation in early memories -- and there ARE some people who have memories from age 2 or 3. But the nature of memory itself is such that such having an early memory like that may not mean exactly what you think it means.",1389219319

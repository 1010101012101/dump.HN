I would take a look at each and decide which style you like better.<p>In general... ruby there are many ways to do things ( bit of a perl influence there ), python tends towards one sanctioned way to do things. That is a horrible overstatement but somewhat true.<p>I would advise you to send a few days with each and see which seems more natural. I prefer ruby w/ its blocks and more smalltalk and lisp-ish feel to things but I did python programming for a number of years and you will be fine learning either.<p>You should switch from php even if you go back to php to learn something new and expand your knowledge AND don't stop there, keep learning and go father afield later. Pick a functional language like scheme, clojure, haskell etc and learn that. Get up and cozy w/ smalltalk for some serious OO learning. Spend sometime with Erlang. Never stop switching what you use to learn even if you keep going back to other things to pay your bills- Java, Perl & C++ payed by bill for 7 years but during that time I learned Dylan, Smalltalk, Scheme, Python & several more.. each one I learned made me a better programmer.",1293753469

2053962,story,,,10,6,gtcode,"Ask HN: Disclaimer for limitation of liability?",,"I am an independent web application developer and a legal issue has arisen for which I am hoping to gain advice.  I recently developed a database application for a new client and have received signals from them regarding their feeling about my liability for the project.  They have hinted that I should be liable for any problems that might arise with the system (which is being marketed to professionals and contains non-financial, but still sensitive data).  I had already signed a fairly thorough NDA before starting the project, but after I submitted a large invoice, they presented me another document that stated I was to deliver a reliable and accurate system, and that they have full ownership.  This seemed reasonable to me, as I agree that they completely own the system and code.  However, after signing, it was at this point that the client hinted about my liability should a problem arise.  Then, I received confirmation that he is presenting the document which I signed to an attorney to ensure that it is thorough.  My fear is that he basically wants to ensure that he can sue me if something goes wrong with the system.<p>The portion of the document to which I am referring simply states that I agree to deliver a reliable and accurate system, and does not state anything regarding my actual liability if something were to go wrong with the system.  Also, I did not ask them to sign any disclaimer regarding my limitations of liability.  As we all know, most software, when you agree to install it, includes fairly thorough wording that obviates the software company from any liability that might arise from using the software.  Should this type of agreement, in some form or fashion, be part of a standard contract into which I might enter with a client?  Given the document that I did sign, what recourse could this client have, should there be a problem that arises with the software?  If any additional info is needed to thoroughly answer the question(s), I will do my best to provide it.<p>Typically, I have a personal and trustworthy relationship with my clients.  I perform honest work and often an actual contract has not been necessary -- I develop code for a client, invoice the client, and then they always promptly remit payment.  This process, which might seem risky to others, has worked well for me in my geography.  However, this situation has made me re-think the process a bit, at least regarding self-protection in terms of liability disclaimers.<p>Any and all input regarding this situation and/or your past experiences is appreciated.",1293753149

Yes, we move and communicate a lot faster, and there are a lot more of us, but at the core you can still see the same sorts of organizational units showing up, and the relationships between those organizational units function very similarly.

While it would be wonderful (as a Brit) to think the European music industry has finally reached enlightenment, that's not the case.<p>* it's not ""any song by any artist"" (although it does pretty well).  Recent releases are generally missing; certain artists (like Bob Dylan) and labels have opted out entirely.<p>* Spotify has negotiated a deal with the collection agencies to get its music catalog.  If the agencies decide to renegotiate, they could essentially kill Spotify at will (like what nearly happened to Pandora, and forced them to block non-US listeners).<p>* the service doesn't ""support itself"" - last year it lost £16 million [1].  While I'm sure they have plans to reach breakeven, until they do they're dependent in principle on their ability to raise new capital.<p>* the ""big four"" major European record labels are investors and shareholders in Spotify, between them holding nearly 20% of the company according to some sources [2].  They probably (speculation) have board seats.  In other words, the labels have significant control over Spotify's direction and decisions.<p>* the popularity of Spotify is a highly visible PR win for the music industry's political campaign.  The EU and its member states are currently debating things like copyright reform and how to stimulate an IP-centric economy.  The record labels, of course, lobby to keep the law exactly how it is, but with stronger rights enforcement measures (preferably in civil as well as criminal cases) and longer copyright terms.  Entrepreneurs are calling for things like a compulsory music license for online broadcasting, meaning music startups could experiment with new business models with predictable costs, and without the massive existential risk of having to individually negotiate terms with the collection agencies.  Spotify means the music industry gets to say ""look, music startups are doing great!"", hiding the fact that most prospective music startups won't ever have the chance to get the kind of licensing deal Spotify got by handing over equity to the labels.<p>I'm not meaning to bash on Spotify as a service - it's brilliant.  But it's not an indicator that the music industry ""finally gets it"".  The music industry is just as screwed and stupid as it's always been, and their backing of Spotify is so politicised it's hard to see it as a good sign.<p>[1] <a href=""http://eu.techcrunch.com/2010/11/22/spotify-had-a-16-66m-loss-in-2009-a-rumoured-us-launch-is-now-imperative/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eu.techcrunch.com/2010/11/22/spotify-had-a-16-66m-los...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2009/08/07/this-is-quite-possibly-the-spotify-cap-table/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2009/08/07/this-is-quite-possibly-the-...</a>",1293752306

I do not wish to detract from them.

This kind of incident will repeat as long as companies believe they can get something out of it. Someone else will cave or will plain not know any better. The companies' goal is, basically, harassment, and they will continue to do it regardless of anything that's happened so far.

It does take some money to run the site, but there are some <i>very</i> ambitious folks there who want to make it more of a big-time NGO, so much of the fundraising is not really aimed at servers+code, but at some of the big-dream initiatives, like fixing education in Africa or something. There are also increasing numbers of ""overhead"" employees: full-time donor-relations and PR/marketing/outreach folks (not just one or two of them, but more like 10-15). They have picked up technical hiring, though; for a while, <i>all</i> the new hires were of the other sort.<p>I used to be really involved in Wikimedia meta-stuff from 2003-2006 or so, until more of that started happening. I personally favor a grassroots-community plus minimal legal infrastruture model, like Debian has with its ""parent"" foundation Software in the Public Interest, which basically pays the bills and otherwise mostly stays out of the way. Other people, especially those with previous experience in the ""nonprofit sector"", have in mind a much more professionalized nonprofit organization, along the lines of the Sierra Club or one of the big NGOs. I'm skeptical of those organizations, especially when it comes to community-driven initiatives, though I think they do sometimes do good work. But imagine a Debian where the Release Manager position was actually a full-time, professional position, hired by SPI. There are some pros to that (a full-time employee being paid to do the job can devote more time), but I think it runs a lot of risks as well.<p>Some of one's views on that might also depends on what you think the scope of the Wikimedia Foundation should be. I tend to favor a more limited scope, where they focus on shepherding the <i>production</i> of content (by volunteers), and then making it available for free under an open-content license. Other people favor a more comprehensive mission of being a content producer+publisher+distributor. There is much more that can be done with the content once it exists, in terms of repackaging, distributing it to various parts of the world, remixing it into useful subsets, producing new interfaces to it, etc.<p>But I'd rather see third parties do that: part of the whole point of making something open content is that anyone can do those things, not only the Wikimedia Foundation, and you don't even need its permission to do them (though friendly coordination is always good). I think the whole ecosystem would be healthier if there were more interesting things being done with the Wikipedia content by organizations and people <i>other</i> than the Wikimedia Foundation. Instead of doing those things itself, I'd rather it focused on figuring out why not that many third parties are doing interesting things with the content (one potential point of improvement: what kinds of database dumps Wikimedia provides, and how regularly it provides them).",1293751037

Your inability to find a workable framework is more evidence to me of your lack of imagination than it is that the problem is fundamentally unsolvable. There&#x27;s a finite number of consistent models to explore, and one of them will give us what we want.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if you want to call that a technological problem or a social problem; the world isn&#x27;t actually divided in those terms. So saying &quot;social problems&quot; strikes me as starting with a shitty model of what we are capable of. It&#x27;s also just corporate-talk and there&#x27;s no reason to expect it to be valid in this domain.

TF has announced that they will update to v4 support, which should help quite a bit - but when many hobbyists and researchers are developing on one or two GPUs performance on that scale is more important (for them) than infinite scalability.<p>It is not surprising that a tool developed and focused on `Google scale` work has some imperfections in a wildly different setting. The question is - will they (or some dedicated contributor) speed up a use case the business itself may not have a use for? My gut feeling is that they will, but these things usually don`t happen overnight. Torch, Theano, and Caffe have years of work put into them and have largely been focused on the one to two GPU case.",1447257545

Purity in any language is quite rare.<p>In the case of C++, it is possible to ignore much of that old baggage most or maybe even all of the time if you write new code using new features. I agree that those maintaining much older codebases are going to have a rough time, but is not an uncommon problem in many languages.<p>Also, even in a so-called &quot;better&quot; language you can run into massive refactoring projects with older code once you choose to adopt new libraries and tools. As Bjarne says, C++11 is much better, C++14 will be even better, and C++17 is further going to be better... frankly, this is a good path for any language to be on.",1447257543

Different notes have some degree of (sometimes approximate) overlap in their harmonic series (indeed, the greater the overlap, the more the notes sound to be in harmony).  So, all of the tones in the un-notes&#x27; harmonic series will still be present as overtones of the other notes.

As of now, it’s only a question of whether they want to.<p>The most interesting point of this review in my opinion.  x86 is hampered by backwards-compatibility.

10547101,comment,10537941,10546621,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"One thing to keep in mind with ideas like the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis is their predictive power. Once a &quot;theory of everything&quot; describes what <i>could have been</i> as well as what <i>is</i>, you end up needing <i>another</i> theory to distinguish between the two [1].<p>For example, Champernowne&#x27;s constant contains every number in its decimal expansion, and hence contains a complete description of our universe, all of the true laws of Physics and the outcome of every random quantum effect. However, it&#x27;s not a very satisfactory &quot;theory of everything&quot;, since it makes no predictions. (Note that I could have used pi instead, but its not yet known whether pi is a &quot;normal&quot; number [3]). This is the same idea as the Library of Babel [4].<p>On the other hand, if you start distinguishing between possible worlds in some way, then you can do real science. For example, the Boltzmann Brain idea describes ordered systems (like our Universe) emerging from disordered systems (like clouds of gas) by pure chance [5]. Such a statistical argument is useful, since we can reason about probability distributions over possible Universes. In this case, small pockets of order are vastly more likely to arise spontaneously than large ones (since we can consider a large pocket to be a contiguous collection of smaller pockets), hence we obtain predictions for all kinds of experiments: namely that we&#x27;ll probably see a cloud of gas, rather than any ordered structure. Since we tend to see ordered structure, we can prove the hypothesis wrong experimentally.<p>A related idea, which is also relevant for this article, is that the Universe could be generated by a random <i>computer program</i> [7]. If we apply the same reasoning as with Boltzmann Brains, we would expect <i>short</i> programs to be vastly more likely than <i>long</i> programs. Since the length of a program determines how &quot;random&quot; its result is (in the Kolmogorov sense [8]), short programs would produce more ordered structure than long programs, hence this hypothesis make the <i>opposite</i> prediction to the Boltzmann Brain: i.e. that when we observe new places, we will tend to see the same kind of order as we have already observed elsewhere. So far, these predictions seem to hold ;)<p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5434"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5434</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champernowne_constant"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champernowne_constant</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number</a>\n[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel</a>\n[5] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain</a>\n[6] <a href=""http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2008/12/29/richard-feynman-on-boltzmann-brains/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2008/12/29/richard-...</a>\n[7] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011122"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011122</a>\n[8] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity</a>",1447255887

From what I can tell, it has about the same appeal haha.<p>I&#x27;ve been legitimately impressed by the abilities of certain artists to really push the boundaries and limits - in my opinion - of packing in musicality in the D&B platform. One I can point to would be Camo & Krooked[0]. Another that sort of crosses into bass music would be Knife Party[1]. What they have in common, to my ears, is that they&#x27;re able to embrace the full spectrum of available sounds. High peaks and really, really deep bass. Then, with so much digital control, they can go up and down, place certain sounds in certain tonal areas...it&#x27;s just amazing to me.<p>One of the things that infuriates me about music commentary is the tired refrain of &quot;rock is dead&quot; or &quot;music isn&#x27;t original anymore&quot; because frankly, they&#x27;re not true. Rock continues to be a broad genre, and I really see electronic-production tunes like Skrillex an extension of rock and metal in that it appeals to a younger audience (predominately) and is very abrasive to &#x27;traditional&#x27; ears.<p>Music is really going through a metamorphasis of innovation thanks to software like Ableton and the numerous brilliant synths out there. It&#x27;s one thing to say &quot;I don&#x27;t like that music&quot; but it&#x27;s completely dishonest to say nothing&#x27;s original anymore. Yes, there will always be &#x27;trend jumpers&#x27; and some formulaic stuff (it goes for all genres, and specifically anything Max Martin touches), but now and then, BAM.

Partitioning the model on more than 8 machines actually slows training, as network overhead starts to dominate in the fully-connected network structure and there is less work for each machine to perform with more partitions.&quot; (&quot;The moderately sized&quot; model here has 42 million model parameters. Check the paper for details.)<p>&quot;In contrast, the much larger, locally-connected image models can benefit from using many more machines per model replica.

If you are unable to defend your preferred position in a debate, maybe it isn&#x27;t as perfect and obvious as you thought it was.<p>No, the right to exist in peace is not negotiable. If it is then we&#x27;re living in a world that fundamentally is built on evil principles as it makes human life without value. It gives a justification to murder, rape, and steal so long as you get away with it. Human lives must have fundamental value and with it fundamental rights such as the right to self-identification (ex. gender identity and expression), economic autonomy (free to trade in a free market), and social autonomy (ex. freedom of association).<p>Without those rights we get a brutal world where only the strongest decides what&#x27;s good and right. We&#x27;ve already had that for the majority of history. I&#x27;m sure no one in the West would want to go back to those times where life was short and painful. Only someone foolish would think such conditions are desirable or sustainable (at least with our level of technology, especially in warfare).<p>>But if, rather than just bowing out of debates, you start to demand that everyone else just step in line with your position, and threaten and mob them if they don&#x27;t... well.<p>False equivalence. I never stated I wanted to mob anyone. But I will say if you want to be my friend or part of my family then you do have to adhere to some moral standard I find compatible. That&#x27;s not up for negotiation. Everyone would agree that ultimately if you can&#x27;t agree that X person has the right to exist in Y way (ex. allowing a transwoman to medically and socially transition) then there&#x27;s nothing to debate. It&#x27;s a conflict between fundamental principles. There&#x27;s nothing to be gained by one bowing to the other. They&#x27;re antagonists of the worse sort. Better they not associate than &#x27;debate&#x27; which usually entails more violence than non-association.<p>Also, criticizing someone in the public sphere isn&#x27;t even equivalent to mobbing. If I send you death threats or call your boss then that&#x27;s mobbing, harassment, and bullying. If I call you a dipstick on Twitter and not evade your block afterwards; it&#x27;s mean words.

Most certainly.  But you can&#x27;t point to a few glaring problems (which I agree, there are) and compare to some hypothetical ideal without acknowledging the many things the political system gets right, as evidenced by America being the richest, most powerful nation in world history.<p>In any democratic system there will be winners and losers.  Just by the sheer number of decisions that are made, you&#x27;re going to end up on the losing end of many.  If you&#x27;re <i>really</i> unlucky, you might be on the losing side of a ton.  From that perspective, I&#x27;m sure the process looks terrible.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s broken or worthless.  In the long-run, things <i>do</i> seem to get done.  I think history bears that out.  Yes, I&#x27;m a long-run optimist on the economy and humanity in general.",1447254117

Specifically, they did not allow you to use a PO Box address as your physical address.  Makes sense.  Well, I lived in a rural area, so my physical address was &quot;Route 1 Box 246&quot; (back then there was NO other designation for the house location that I could use, now commonly known as a &quot;911 address&quot;).  The website would not allow me to sign up because &quot;Box&quot; appeared in the middle of the address line.  I sent them an email and they had it fixed remarkably fast, but I have used it over the years as a good example of a case for not making assumptions on input.",1447254108

I've done some client work and some small personal sites with LAMP.<p>For the past 2 months I've been coding a lot, and trying to pick a PHP framework (just coding pure PHP before now). Went through Zend, Symfony, Kohana, CodeIgniter Reactor, found none to be suitable, then settled on Yii (great framework).<p>However, as I'm not currently invested in any PHP frameworks, or even in the PHP language too much, I decided to see if I should try something else. (This is for a high-potential project)<p>After researching, I'm now leaning towards Python. Partly because of the ubiquitous Django, partly because of those who already use it (not that I'm doing it to be 'cool', but so many companies and HNers can't be wrong), and partly because it couldn't hurt to have another language either way.<p>I know the whole ""use what you know"" motto, but as I'm still at square one (haven't starting coding the project) and not in need of income for a few years (first year college student) I'd like to do it right from the start.<p>PHP was great for learning everything from variables and loops to OOP, Design Patterns, etc. so I'd like to think picking up a new language won't be a huge task. I'm doing C# in college and find it no problem due to my PHP experience.<p>I'm a few chapters into Dive Into Python (http://diveintopython.org/) and it seems even easier than PHP so far.<p>Any feedback on this would be greatly appreciated before I go all-out.<p>TL;DR: 1st year college student, coding (hobby) PHP on-and-off for 1.5 years, about to start a big (potential startup) project and going to switch to Python/Django.

Get it out of your head.<p>- make weekly and monthly reviews of your work. The things you have accomplished.<p>- keep a daily log/journal not necessarily of things you have done but make side notes of things that affected you. New articles, a movie that changed your perspective on things, a new idea etc. If it comes back over and over, consider writing more about the subject<p>- clarify your long term goals vs the short ones. That's the difference between being busy doing client work for money to pay bills and being busy working on projects that will change your life (i.e scratching your own itch)<p>- track your progress: I track it using three columns. What I have planned for today, what I actually did and what I failed to do. My TODO system automatically assigns a score to that day and reschedules tasks.\nIn my calendar, I do not have ""completed"" days, I have scores tracking my performance.<p>- define what is important to you and develop the habits you want to have: Exercise every day? (20 points), Work for clients (20 points), work on your weekly/monthly personal goal (e.g learn zsh) (50 points).

I'm sure you can find rents below £1300 for two bedrooms if you go further out. But you pay in train fares and commute time, especially if your office isn't central.

I've been traveling to Japan for business for 10 years and I think this difference in approach is the chief reason why most American firms never really 'get' Japan. Their business motives and market DNA are fundamentally different from America's devotion to growth and scale. In Japan it's not about growth, it's about consistency and quality, often even to the detriment of the business.<p>I think that's also why, in terms of tech startups, Korea & China & Singapore will ultimately leave Japan behind.",1298657105

They wouldn't even be possible if the parts couldn't be had for less than the sale price.<p>But until somebody in the industry breaks from the pack and says ""I'm going to offer this cheaply, damn the profits"", all that cost savings accrues in profits to the OEMs.  That maverick could be an upstart startup intent on market share with nothing to lose.  Or it could be a nonprofit director on a mission to save the 3rd world.<p>In this case, the OLPC was the catalyst.  The technology existed beforehand, and most people <i>knew</i> the technology existed.  But Nicholas Negroponte was the first one to say ""It can be done, therefore let's do it.""<p>The same structure exists in lots of other industries.

If the site is down it might be down for real or the client might have no internet connection, instead of the IP being outdated. If there's another site on the old IP then it will connect and return valid headers. You'd have to rely on the user already knowing the website they wanted to see and saying ""that isn't right try again but properly this time"" and that assumes it is something user facing rather than a POP3 connection which suddenly ""can't connect"" or gives a login failure.<p>Plus you'd then need every popular TCP/IP using program ever to be rewritten to have a ""try again but this time with a full DNS requery"" option.<p>> 50+ queries to a varied array of servers to find the IP's for one host is not unusual<p>So fix that, don't overhaul the whole system because some people can't configure it properly.

This happened some years ago; I did it because I was very busy with my own startup and I decided focusing on the startup was a better idea. Also, I noticed that I learned much faster by myself than on the university (though that university wasn't a very good one, so maybe it was worth dropping it anyway).<p>This is how things continue now: as I'm passionate about cs and maths, I keep buying undergraduate and graduate level books which I read cover to cover. Since I cannot spend too much doing this because I have other obligations now -I'm not a full time student-, depending on the book, it can be one to four months per book. I'm not focusing on exercises much so far, but rather on learning the concepts and general tools of the trade, which I try to apply whenever possible. So it's possible that a big part of what I read, even if I understand it, will be forgotten in some time, unless I find a way to apply it or to set it in my memory in a better way. I'm using spaced repetition for memorizing important equations and concepts that I don't want to forget though.<p>In the last two years I think I have learned a lot, at a pace slightly slower than that of university (though with a wider variety and more advanced texts maybe). I think I can keep learning this way, progressing to more and more advanced concepts.<p>I'm posting here because I don't know about any other person doing this kind of disciplined self teaching.

It only makes sense to do dedicated hardware for things that aren't feasible to do using general-purpose silicon at the time (notable exceptions are for simpler things like ethernet controller chips, although if a general-purpose CPU is cheap enough to replace the chip, maybe that will change). As you pointed out, hardware speeds do get exponentially faster over time, which makes it less desirable to go to the effort of designing purpose-specific hardware.<p>The problem with current FPGA and CPLD solutions where you would be able to upload your own algorithms is that currently they operate much more slowly than mask manufactured ASICs.

It appeared to be in orbit around the Earth, and was soon discovered from spectral analysis to be covered in white titanium dioxide paint, the same paint used for the Saturn V. Calculation of orbital parameters identified the apparent asteroid as being the Apollo 12 S-IVB stage. Mission controllers had planned to send Apollo 12's S-IVB into solar orbit, but the burn after separating from the Apollo spacecraft lasted too long, and hence it did not pass close enough to the Moon, remaining in a barely-stable orbit around the Earth and Moon. In 1971, through a series of gravitational perturbations, it is believed to have entered in a solar orbit and then returned into weakly-captured Earth orbit 31 years later. It left Earth orbit again in June 2003. Another near-earth object, discovered in 2006 and designated 6Q0B44E, may also be part of an Apollo spacecraft.</i>",1262278862

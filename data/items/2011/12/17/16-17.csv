At some point there's not debate, yeah Java is crap, yeah Eclipse is laggy, etc, but my hands, brain and code work completely in concert when all those are united and there's no question that I can get anything done much, much faster with these. I actually gave up on using a macbook after a year and a half of constant practice because it still felt far too tiring to build my android apps compared to the PC, even though it was still Java and Eclipse.<p>It would be the equivalent of speaking your mother language (or native tongue or first language, whatever you english-speaking people call it :P) vs speaking a language with which you're ""only"" fluent when you just have to express a point very fast.<p>I'm not saying Notch is in the same situation (or anyone else actually), just that there are reasons, beyond being able to get things done using just the available tools, to use a setup that is often seen as suboptimal.",1324141041

Your story counts as an isolated incident because you're male, whereas if you were female and the attacker was male it would be treated as a serious issue by some well-organised lobbyists and any attempt to question this or suggest that male victims exist too would be shot down as a direct attack on you.<p>Of course, this doesn't just affect men; female victims of violently abusive women get similar treatment. There was a lovely incident where a really major feminist blogger wrote a post [1] which talked about her experience of domestic violence and attributed it to the fact that the abuser was male, just completely erasing victims who'd been treated in the same way by a women. Another women had actually experienced this from a female abuser and was quite distressed by being erased in this way, leading to a long discussion[2] in which said big-name feminist claimed without any sense of irony that not allowing her to treat other victims' experiences as impossible was somehow an attack on her and an attempt to erase her experiences as impossible, before going on to further erase the other victim's experiences and call her irrational.<p>As far as I can tell there's pretty much no real movement towards gender equality anywhere, and most of the anti-domestic violence organisations are actually anti-violence against women (but only if it's by men). Sady Doyle is still a respectable member of the online feminist community, the moderators of that blog went against their stated goals and the interests of their commenters to side with her, and I don't think anyone else cared.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tigerbeatdown.com/2011/10/08/the-percentages-a-biography-of-class/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tigerbeatdown.com/2011/10/08/the-percentages-a-biogra...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://noseriouslywhatabouttehmenz.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/sady-doyle-says-a-thing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://noseriouslywhatabouttehmenz.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/...</a>",1324139408

That's unfortunate, as there are much richer possibilities (the Japanese manga industry, for example, caters to so many segments it's mind blowing).<p>But make no mistake: The American comic industry is not an example of male privilege, or any unconscious attempt at keeping women down; It's a vicious cycle of social stigma against comic READERS, and the resulting lack of market for a wider audience.

7353351,comment,7346982,7350308,2,0,antirez,,,"> Cassandra is eventually consistent. Consistency is pretty important.<p>Your above statement unfortunately has no match in distributed systems theory or practice. Basically <i>eventually consistent</i> means that the system is not consistent from the point of view of CAP, so it does not feature strong consistency.<p>As an alternative eventual consistency means: our contract with the user is, that, at least, when there are no partitions, the system will no show split-brain conditions, so a given information will converge to a given value for all the nodes.<p>This alone is a contract with the user, but does not tell a lot, it just tells you:<p>1) No strong consistency, sorry.\n2) No split-brain conditions when the partitions heal.<p>So &quot;It features eventual consistency, consistency is important&quot; statement, I&#x27;m afraid, means that you don&#x27;t have the tradeoffs about distributed systems clear.<p>Now, if EC alone does not mean a lot, how to classify an EC system? It depends on the exact implementation of what happens when there is a partition, and what happens when the partition heals.<p>There are EC systems that are configured by default to accept writes in the minority side (even in partitions when there is a <i>single</i> DB node if we want to honor &quot;A&quot; of CAP), and later will merge depending on &quot;wall clock&quot; timestamps.<p>This is a form of consistency (and is weak), but is not Consistency with capital-C of CAP.<p>Other systems will use vector clocks instead of timestamps, which is stronger but slower. Other systems will instead merge values together doing a &quot;Set union&quot; operation. Here we still have no strong consistency, but the <i>safety</i> of the system is improved.<p>Now that we understand what means strong consistency, and what means eventual consistency, we can talk about Redis Cluster from this point of view. In Redis Cluster, which is eventual consistent, when the partition heals all the nodes will agree by selecting an history between the histories available for a given &quot;hash slot&quot; (a set of keys). However we need to consider what happens during partitions to have a better picture of what happens. In the case of Redis Cluster the minority side of the partition will stop accepting writes after some time. This gives up &quot;A&quot; of CAP in order to put a bound to how much two histories can diverge.<p>Ok, now let&#x27;s explore &quot;A&quot;. CAP Availability is the ability to reply with a positive reply (so, basically, to be able to accept writes is required) to requests even in a minority partition with a single node.<p>This is a very strong idea of availability, but this is not the only possibility to be fault tolerant. For example CP systems don&#x27;t feature &quot;A&quot;, but they are able to work correctly even if N/2-1 nodes will fail. This is a pretty strong failure tolerance! So they are reliable systems for a lot of works even if they don&#x27;t have &quot;A&quot;.<p>As a counter example, Cassandra or Riak would still be very useful tools even without &quot;A&quot; availability, but just with N/2-1 nodes allowed to fail.<p>Ok, back to Redis Cluster. It does not provides &quot;A&quot; since minority partitions are not available. It does not provide &quot;C&quot; since it is eventually consistent. But it still provides a form of consistency (its contract with the user about what happens during partitions) and provides some degree of resilience to failures.<p>AP or CP are just the theoretical limits you can get if you want to exploit the max in this regard, however it is not like a system is useless if it is not AP or CP.<p>In the case of Redis Cluster to renounce to &quot;C&quot; was obvious since it is asynchronously replicated and is not a good fit for high latency interactions. To renounce to the strong availability of &quot;A&quot; was a tradeoff to feature Redis data structures that are limited in size (number of elements) only by available memory.<p>Suggested reading about EC: <a href=""http://www.bailis.org/blog/safety-and-liveness-eventual-consistency-is-not-safe/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bailis.org/blog/safety-and-liveness-eventual-cons...</a>",1394110453

Given how easy it  has proven to be to manipulate BitCoin, I doubt holding value is nearly a problem.<p>My point was not that people already convinced are unhappy, but that those that need convincing are not going to be with an accounting ploy that will only widen the spread, but something that address the story—whatever is the digital equivalent of a thick vault door. And the story is that BitCoin is too complicated to be tamperproof.<p>> The &quot;hot/cold wallet&quot; design is a choice that many naive but greedy people are choosing in building their Bitcoin-based systems but it is not the only choice. In banks you usually only STP low-value, low-risk transactions; in the current breed of Bitcoin-based systems, it would appear that system designers are naivly STPing everything.<p>STP: standard transfer protocol? Your point would be that BitCoin ‘banks’ (on-line hosting of your keys) when asked to transfer above a certain sum need to ask for escrow and wait for two-point authentification? It seems convoluted (which is too say a lot in BitCoin&#x27;s case) but not a bad idea.<p>> There is some kind of strange unstated assumption on HN that regulation magically makes banking safe all by itself, and until that regulation is in place Bitcoin-based systems cannot be safe or effectively risk managed.<p>It&#x27;s neither unstated, nor an assumption: it&#x27;s the point of regulation. Some people claim to regulate, but actually try to cover their asses (namely, the many people whom I’ve known personally for a decade, in charge of monitoring Kerviel) it doesn’t change the stated goal.<p>> until that regulation is in place Bitcoin-based systems cannot be safe or effectively risk managed<p>Nope, greed, expensive individual verification and the fact that security is costly says so. There are plenty of options (all conveniently listed at the end of Akerlof‘s _A Market for Lemons_, a recommended read) many self-enforced, but none is: “My bank is safe because I said so. [Tug on fedora.]”<p>> Using a service that doesn&#x27;t implement these policies is a risky choice<p>Then it&#x27;s not a service, nor more than you’d expect to find an economy based on nitroglycerin as currency.",1394110414

7353345,comment,7353095,7353266,32,0,sehrope,,,"> You can use an ACID compliant database and run into this problem, it&#x27;s a classical race condition.<p>No it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s just sloppy code and/or a misunderstanding of database transactions and isolation levels. If you use an ACID compliant database like PostgreSQL it&#x27;s pretty straightforward to write proper code that would not have this issue.<p>The main concept to understand is that you need to lock <i>all</i> the rows that you&#x27;ll be touching before you use them. In most case this method works fine with the default read-committed isolation level.<p>Code that queries your database in multiple round trips and then compares the values for validity on the app side will have this problem. Anything you read could have been modified by the time you &quot;act on&quot; the information you read. Heck even stored procedures running on the DB itself will have this problem if run in the default read-committed isolation level.<p>The high level solution is to use SELECT ... FOR UPDATE and lock <i>everything</i> that you&#x27;ll be touching before you update anything.<p>> The solution is to implement double bookkeeping and bank reconciliation, but it&#x27;s tedious and complex to implement.<p>This is a business requirement for any accounting/financial software but it&#x27;s not a technical one. Having an audit trail, double entry accounting, and recon are business functions. You&#x27;d be crazy to design a system that didn&#x27;t include them but it&#x27;s not strictly required (<i>again from a technical sense, not a business one!</i>).",1394110373

It&#x27;s hard to track these errors, flowing as they do through the unvalved, convoluted network of criss-crossing ambiguities and imprecision that is natural language and the degrees of freedom it affords when parsing a text.<p>The distilled reductio relies on a gestalt dissonance between superficial similarities in tone and structure, and the inverted conclusion of the two passages, while never attempting to refute the arguments themselves. Of course, for the purposes of logical analysis, tone merely helps arguments go down better, and is irrelevant to the arguments themselves.  The only thing that&#x27;s really retained, then, is the structure of the arguments, and once you are allowed to swap out premises at will, the infinite malleability of natural language will allow you to transform any argument to fit the structure, like liquid conforms to the shape of a glass.<p>We could instead engage directly with the arguments, claiming, for example, that Bitcoin is very much in the nascent stages, and aims to solve fundamental problems in the financial industry. Of course the current financial industry is better at a lot of things, we&#x27;d say. It&#x27;s aged, matured, had an enormous superstructure of fixes and optimizations and safeguards built over decades and decades. It&#x27;s equivalent to arguing grain alcohol is a better tech than battery-powered cars will ever be, while ignoring the enormous entrenched infrastructural advantages afforded to ethanol. And then we&#x27;d argue that comparing Bitcoin and the entire financial industry misses the point- you should be discussing decentralised vs centralised currencies.<p>That&#x27;s probably a more meaningful (albeit less entertaining) way of arguing against the OP. Of course, if you disagree with me, you could rewrite this comment, changing the content completely while carefully retaining all the supererogatory references to alcohol and drinking, and it would seem superficially comparable, especially if the post began with an anchoring catchphrase like &quot;Why Do Decent People Accept Dollars&quot;, or &quot;I Need A Drink.&quot;",1394110064

7353220,comment,7352651,7353091,1,0,joveian,,,"That might be the most important reason to dislike bitcoin right now.  It is obvious why people who have a public ledger that claims they have a bunch of money would be fanatical about wanting other people to recognize that claimed wealth but not at all obvious what is in it for others.<p>However, even if that is fixed (e.g. some other similar cryptocurrency without that issue) I would add two more issues: 1) The system as a whole, for any possible system similar to bitcoin, seems vulnerable to being disrupted by anyone with enough money (at best this would still cost a fair amount of money, but I&#x27;m fairly sure it would cost a lot less and be less recoverable than trying to similarly disrupt (at least most) other currencies).  2)  The estimates I&#x27;ve seen suggest that a huge amount of power is going into cryptocurrencies for no good reason.  This seems like both a horrible response to global warming and (per point 1) is making the same cryptographic mistake that hashcash made on a much smaller scale.  Hashcash seemed like a good idea at the time, but I&#x27;m not sure why it seems like a good idea to anyone now.<p>I would love to see more work done on various ways to implement robust local currencies rather than all this effort on trying to create fragile global currencies that suck huge amounts of power.  Last I looked there were a few things available but it seems like a lot more can be done.",1394108393

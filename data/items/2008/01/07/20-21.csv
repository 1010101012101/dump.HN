I'm not put off by the platform because of the initial incarnation of the language I still want an Android phone and expect to write programs for it at some point. Instead, I'm saying that I'm put off by the contest because of the rules - which is something different.",1199739374

Some comments:<p>1) I loved the fact that the AA guns could damage its allies (my enemies) - after a rounds where I would engage the other planes away from the guns, I had much more luck dogfighting around the guns because there were so many more of them than me.<p>2) So much of my strategy was flying around and around and around that it was tough to hit stationary targets<p>3) Because of #2, I had a terrible time with the Zepplin because not only were all the targets stationary but there was much less room to fly.<p>All in all, it was a good mix of challenges and extremely fun to play.  Keep up the good work!",1199739215

You must use a framework, or you will end up with a bug-filled half implemented version of a framework that exists.  Large project?  Perhaps you can write a framework, but perhaps consider extending a current framework to your likings.<p>Why the hell would you write your own framework and reproduce all the features of an existing framework (if such a framework exists, which it does for Java, Ruby, Python, etc.)",1199738441

Very rarely will users of hacker news want to go to ycombinator.com, so having the link in such a prominent position is a mistake.",1199737497

95734,comment,95254,95448,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Well, like I said: the anecdotes are fine. I don't necessarily have a problem with anecdotes. One of my favorite genres is the oral history, in which a historian sits with a bunch of people and just writes down their anecdotes. (<i>The Box: An Oral History of Television</i> is really good, but let's not forget <i>Founders At Work</i>, which is essentially in the same genre.) You can learn quite a lot by just listening to people talk about their lives and their professions. I certainly agree that it's good to know that quite a few lawyers are bored stiff, and that quite a few doctors hate practicing medicine in our broken health-care system.<p>What I dislike is this style of journalism where the storyteller tries to tart up the anecdotes with meaningless numbers in an attempt to make them seem more significant. <i>Meaningful</i> numbers would be nice; meaningless numbers just distract you and dilute the directness and frankness of the stories.<p>Reading a story like this is like having a conversation with a day trader: they are anxious to impress you with their detailed knowledge of the up-and-down movements of randomly-walking lines on charts, but they barely know what their favorite company's product is or who its customers are.",1199737148

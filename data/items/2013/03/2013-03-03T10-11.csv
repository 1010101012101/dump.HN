Tea collectors, for example, I believe they're paid so little they are in constant poverty. Why are they paid that way? They collect all the tea people around the world drink. Paying them the increase of the cost of a tea bag by 1 cent will make them comparatively rich. Why isn't it done? They have no bargaining power. Anyone can collect tea badly enough, this is true for most agricultural labour. It is physically hard but you can teach it in half an our. So they can always be easily replaced either with local population or with some illegal immigrants.<p>In the developed world, a lot of people just pass documents around and make phone calls. It's the sophistication of zooplankton and physically much less demanding than agricultural jobs, but you can't quite teach it to anyone in the world in half an hour - you need locals for this (they connect to other people and need to fit culturally) and they need some even very basic skills. So they get paid with actual money you can buy things with.<p>Take coders. Training a coder is not easy and it even requires some aptitude. Thus, even mediocre coders can often command their rules to their employers. And great coders are true citizens of the world, employable anywhere on their terms.<p>So, to make farming cool we have to make it high-tech.
Another problem is that farming doesn't seem very profitable even on the large / capital scale, because the barrier to entry is so low.",1362307979

The author's anecdotes about vision alteration and the brain's ability to adapt were very interesting to me. I have nystagmus: my eyes move back and forth quickly all the time. I've often wondered what it looks like to see without the movement; however, that <i>is</i> how I see: I don't notice the movement at all. My vision with contacts doesn't get much better than 20/40, so I do experience the effects of the movement. I tend to think of my vision as if it's an example of two-point wave interference: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)</a> The further away an image is from my focal points, the more the interference from movement affects my brain's ability to piece it all together; it's similar to tunnel vision, but instead of darkness on the periphery, it's progressively more blur. To see most clearly, I have to tilt my head to the side, to my ""null point"" where my eyes move the least. Not to mention my head moves often in some sort of sync with my eyes, especially while reading; once in school, a substitute teacher raised his voice angrily, thinking I was shaking my head at his work on the board!<p>I'm curious how Google and other developers of high-tech eyewear will account for us with out-of-the-ordinary eye conditions.

Being artificially limited to never being an overlay isn't better than being able to be both an overlay and also just an info panel.)<p>The author posits that Google placed the screen out of the line of sight to avoid vision misalignment and misadjustment problems.<p>(Also, the eyestrain due to focus distances was mentioned, and apparently solved by using an ""aremac"": a pinhole camera in reverse which means the video is focused at every distance.)",1362304845

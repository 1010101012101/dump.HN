It <i>could</i> be that those Perl features are bad whereas transducers are great. I happen to share some skepticism of transducers because they overly-resemble existing features (partial application) and can be implemented pretty easy with existing Clojure tools. Also the marquee use case (sharing transformations between sequences and channels) so far seems exceedingly rare to me, though maybe things are moving in a direction where that&#x27;s more important.<p>> And like you said, if you don&#x27;t understand it you don&#x27;t have to use it.<p>True to an extent, but (a) the high prominence given to the feature may well lead to a situation where you can&#x27;t read other peoples&#x27; code without learning the concept, and (b) it&#x27;s easy to create transducers by accident.<p>[1] e.g. &quot;..&quot; in <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/ancient-languages-perl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/ancient-languages-...</a>",1435683552

9806662,comment,9805520,9806224,0,0,pron,,,"> Programming language designers should avoid adding powerful, higher-order abstractions because they are hard to understand?<p>In general? Absolutely![1] Making algorithms easier for humans to understand is the whole purpose of abstractions.<p>Programming is based two things: algorithms and abstractions, with algorithms being fundamental to computation and abstractions are usability features designed to help people write code -- that is their <i>one and only purpose</i> (computers and even theoretical computational models don&#x27;t care about abstractions). Unlike algorithms, abstractions are not useful in isolation, and their utility is not a function of mathematical &quot;power&quot; but of psychological benefit. Their utility is measured by how much they help the human programmer write and read an algorithm[2]. Another way to look at it is that algorithms tackle essential complexity and abstractions tackle accidental complexity[3].<p>More specifically, abstractions help human programmers in two ways: they increase code reuse and improve code readability.<p>But here&#x27;s the thing. There are things other than powerful abstractions that help humans program -- for example, a clear  execution model (what happens when), debuggability etc.. This means that the more powerful (i.e. abstract) abstractions become they do not necessarily perform their function -- namely, assisting developers -- better. So every abstraction must be carefully weighed: how much wasted code does it save, how much more readable it makes code, vs. how much does it hurt understanding or debuggability.<p>I&#x27;d say transducers are just about the point where the abstraction starts hurting more than it helps. It&#x27;s a borderline case. Now, I am not saying Clojure <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> have transducers (again, borderline), but that they most certainly shouldn&#x27;t be emphasized.<p>> if you don&#x27;t understand it you don&#x27;t have to use it.<p>That doesn&#x27;t quite work. I said, don&#x27;t use them <i>right away</i>. Once a programming language and its libraries use an abstraction, you <i>must</i> learn it sooner or later. After all, most code you&#x27;ll read isn&#x27;t your own. This is why every language feature has a cost, and why good language developers are hesitant about introducing new features (transducers aren&#x27;t a language feature, but they do have a prominent place in the standard library).<p>---<p>[1]: For example, Java and Go are both languages whose designers intentionally and radically reduced the use of many of the abstractions available in other popular languages of their time. Java in particular drastically removed abstractions possible by <i>the most popular</i> language at the time it was introduced, and attained tremendous success, partly because of that (well, at the time it was already apparent that C++&#x27;s power -- in addition to its lack of safety -- was greatly detrimental to code maintenance in most parts of the industry).<p>[2]: Abstractions are secondary to algorithms. Also note how almost all sub-disciplines of computer science deal with algorithms, and just one, rather small, discipline -- PL research -- is concerned with abstractions.<p>[3]: Even algorithms are often not judged in isolation; there are lots and lots of useful algorithms that aren&#x27;t used because they are too hard to implement and maintain correctly -- regardless of abstractions used.",1435683296

NVidia has stated that they will never do a console-specific chip again. That said, I don&#x27;t think that they would have a problem with supplying an off-the-shelf Tegra model in a console for 10 years.

You can&#x27;t uninstall it or run away from it.<p>Using every other service requires downloading that service&#x27;s app and while that isn&#x27;t a huge barrier for those of us in tech, that is a HUGE barrier for everybody else. Plus think about all the grandparents, soccer moms, and teenage girls that use iPhones and don&#x27;t really consider any other phone. Those people probably aren&#x27;t the people that are using Google Play or Spotify, but now they have Apple Music on their phone and ready to go. With all the attention Apple Music has been getting from that whole Taylor Swift Fiasco, there&#x27;s no doubt that almost everyone has heard of it already and eagerly awaiting its arrival.<p>If you&#x27;re a techie and you own an Apple device, then why partition your music selection with Spotify? Apple Music has almost every song Spotify does plus Apple has a better relationship with the record companies, so you know you&#x27;re money isn&#x27;t going to a company that&#x27;s under some serious pressure to change their business model. Plus Apple Music has music videos and a social component for artists to reach out to their fans - which is kinda slick in my opinion. If none of that moves you then okay, try it for free for 3 months. Three months!! No matter what you think about Apple Music&#x27;s competitors, why not stop paying them for a month and try out Apple Music? I&#x27;d wager many people aren&#x27;t going to move after that.<p>Apple Music&#x27;s future success won&#x27;t depend on the service it&#x27;s self, but on fitting into Apple&#x27;s ecosystem and Apple&#x27;s ability to reach the general public in ways that other streaming services can&#x27;t. Plus, iPhones are the best selling phones in the United States so a lot of people will have this service already. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if by the end of the week, more people have Apple Music on their phones than Spotify.<p>Spotify is in serious trouble.

Transducers take advantage of that.<p>Unfortunately, if you try to do that, you&#x27;ll notice that the implementation is sometimes tied with the way you build the entity: e.g. for vectors, map implemented in terms of reduce would start with an empty vector then append to it.<p>That sucks. We want operation chains that are independent of the data structure they operate on. We want them to work on vectors, lists, channels, whatever - anything that can have a reduce-like operation (anything reducible)<p>However, it turns out you don&#x27;t necessarily have to recreate the entity (e.g. list) when chaining. All you need to know how to do is invoke the next operation in the chain, i.e. the next reduction function. For example:<p>* map can apply the function on the element to get a new result, then call the next reduction function with the accumulator and that new result.<p>* filter can check the element and either return the old accumulator or apply the next reduction function with the element, etc.<p>Therefore, transducers simply take an additional argument: the next reduction function that should be applied. This lets you build up a chain of operations (e.g. map filter etc) that doesn&#x27;t care about the kind of entity they&#x27;re operating on. Only the last &quot;step&quot; must be a reduction function that needs to know how to build the result.",1435683176

Even in the RFC you linked it says 30 seconds.<p>> This is mandated because the user could start typing at the end of a time step and/or clocks can be slightly out of sync.<p>That is the downside of TOTP. If your clock isn&#x27;t in sync with the server&#x27;s then you may never have a valid OTP. However, I have seen many implementations allow for time shifting - ie the code that was generated in the past 30 seconds, this 30 seconds and the next 30 seconds are all valid. I didn&#x27;t do that for my source code hosting service - but it makes sense in case the user hit enter right after the 30 second window. I suppose HOTP is supposed to solve the timing problem.<p>> That does not change the fact that TOTP is extremely vulnerable to phishing.<p>This doesn&#x27;t make sense - TOTP isn&#x27;t any more vulnerable than the password itself. You still need my password. And even if you phished that - by the time you would attempt to access my account the TOTP would be invalid. The only way that would work is if you were actively watching the captured credentials and attempted to login right away. That to me would be a targeted attack rather than some random phish.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki</a>",1435682695

9806511,comment,9805056,9805056,0,0,mercanator,,,"In our organization we have seen tremendous value using docker for our CI server (bamboo) and for infrastructure deployment. 
On the CI server side of things....
Our CI server a.k.a the &quot;host machine&quot; in docker speak has a MySQL database that we did not want used by all of our builds and wanted to isolate the creation of our application from the ground up within using its own MySQL instance. Additionally there is a lot of other peripheral software that we did not want to install on our host machine but it was critical for our unit tests to run. This is where docker is valuable to us from a build perspective. It allows us to isolate the application for unit testing and not get caught up with the possibility of other running software on the same machine affecting the builds, therefore freeing us up from debugging, and therefore saving the company money because developers are not wasting time debugging CI server issues. It&#x27;s easy to isolate CI server related issues from the docker container running the unit tests because a developer can just run the same tests using the container on their local machine, so it creates a consistent environment.<p>On the infrastructure deployment side of things....
Previous to our &quot;dockerized&quot; infrastructure we were managing about 7 different AMI&#x27;s for all our servers and it was becoming a pain in the butt to manage the installation of new software if our application called for it, create a new AMI, then re-deploy said AMI. If you have experience with AWS and you have done this enough times, I&#x27;m sure you have faced at one point or another long wait times for your AMI to be created before you can re-deploy with that newly created AMI. This is time wasted on the application deployment side of things, but also on the personnel side of things while you wait for that damn thing to be created so you can re-deploy. Time is money and money waiting for resources to be available or for AMI&#x27;s to be created is money taken away from the business. Additionally though in its infancy stage, we are using docker-compose (<a href=""https://docs.docker.com/compose/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.docker.com/compose/</a>) which offers some really nice ways of defining your container infrastructure within a single machine, I highly recommend looking into this for further efficiency.",1435682280

With &#x27;offload&#x27; people often think about feature like computing checksums in hardware, but that&#x27;s not a big deal on modern hardware.  OpenOnload definitely leverages the cards capabilities, notably packet buffer handling which is exposed in their ef_vi API (there&#x27;s a comment about this on the article&#x27;s page); the flow steering (mentioned in the article) is a big help too.  OpenOnload is a user space network stack built on top of ef_vi.<p>But so much the win come from being userspace and tunable.  OpenOnload also accelerate pipes, loopback UDP/TCP and epoll, all of which are unrelated to their hardware.  Indeed, having unaccelerated fds in the same epoll set as accelerated fds kills performance because it needs to ask the kernel for the status of the unaccelerated fds.<p>That said, I think you need to have a SolarFlare card for OpenOnload to work at all, even if you just use it for local communication.

Our thinking is that the protocol would enable a <i>read-only</i> monitor, which would be able to see the plaintext but not modify it without detection. As the article says, this is what it would take to build a good IDS/IPS for your things -- something that can audit the communications and make sure what&#x27;s going in and out matches what you should expect.<p>We&#x27;re <i>not</i> proposing that the IDS/IPS should necessarily be able to MITM the connections. Then you&#x27;re just putting all your trust into the IDS/IPS and making it the single point of vulnerability (just like the device is now). But if you have a construction that lets you build a read-only IDS/IPS, then you could in theory buy 100 of them from different manufacturers and have them all audit each other.<p>One straw-man way to do this would be to run a stream of &quot;integrity-only TLS&quot; inside normal TLS. The outer TLS would allow the owner to install their own CA root certificate on the Thing. The inner TLS would be pinned to the public key of the cloud provider. The IDS/IPS would MITM the outer connection and would be able to read the inner stream, but the MAC on the inner stream would prevent tampering by the IDS/IPS.",1435681835

Both stage performance experience in music alongside academic (National Forensics League) and professional (presentation development and coaching in Fortune-level corporations) public speaking roles. Guitarist for 20 years or so, did public speaking and acting for about 10 counting high school and college, and another 5-6 working in the trenches of B2B sales (RFPs, etc) as a blend of creative / technical / team manager.<p>To add a bit of side-note, I&#x27;d like to point out that humor tends to be so highly subjective that it&#x27;s best to avoid trying to go there (akin to avoiding pop-culture). Being clever or witty is a way to show off, in such a format, and there&#x27;s no reason to try and show off when the room is already yours, practically speaking.<p>To me, it&#x27;s a large turn-off when such deviations from the plan show up - being competent means being engaging, and through engagement the audience will appreciate the presentation for what it is doing / trying to convey.<p>Allowing questions during a presentation is not preferred, but if presenting to a potential client, sometimes inevitable. I use the phrase &quot;bus out of nowhere&quot; to try and prepare people to be able to handle a difficult or even insulting question without totally losing footing. It&#x27;s like a car crash, just let it happen in slow motion, hang on, and don&#x27;t make any sudden moves to go in a different direction...just get through the question, avoid trying to be clever or witty in response, and get back to the script.<p>I think Willie Nelson also had a relevant piece of advice regarding performing, in that it&#x27;s good to get some practice in, but don&#x27;t over-work something to the point of it being robotic. The performance should have some of that liveliness that comes from knowing something well but walking the line of risking that a mistake could happen...that&#x27;s what can be so compelling about a great speaker, there&#x27;s a mix of energy, competence, and human nature that gets people to tune in.",1435681542

The people who will suffer most are and will be the poor in Greece, including those on fixed incomes such as pensioners. Yet these are the people with the least power over what their government does. Drive through a poor neighborhood in your town; how responsible are those people for their national government&#x27;s economic policies? It&#x27;s cruel and frankly evil to impose the costs on them.<p>2) Making people suffer is not nearly enough of a response. Nor is saying &#x27;their suffering is not our problem&#x27;. Those are non-responses and, I think, moral failure. The people of Germany may need other Europeans&#x27; help some day -- they got it after WWII and, for example, they expect their NATO allies to defend them, with the U.S. bearing most of the burden --  they may want to set a better precedent. EDIT: &quot;You’ll never guess which hardline euro zone country has had its debts repeatedly forgiven&quot;[1]<p>3) This is a leadership failure of the entire EU. There is no way something this critical should have gotten to this point. Part of it, I think, is the failure of EU leaders to stand up for the EU&#x27;s importance. The nationalistic and xenophobic right-wing, along with Ayn Randian economic policies, are ascendent and nobody is challenging them. Thus the public sees little reason to protect the EU or those suffering in Greece.<p>[1] <a href=""http://qz.com/441187/youll-never-guess-which-hardline-euro-zone-country-has-had-its-debts-repeatedly-forgiven/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qz.com/441187/youll-never-guess-which-hardline-euro-z...</a>",1435681158

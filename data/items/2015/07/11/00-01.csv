I&#x27;d prefer all of the communities stay on a site like reddit, where specific users get banned for clear violations of harassment rules, rather than the entire communities getting shut down because of the actions of a few. Most communities on reddit had clear anti-harassment rules and moderators usually banned it when it was seen.<p>Now, instead, the communities are moving over to sites like voat.co and 8ch.net - communities that won&#x27;t get policed in any way whatsoever. And in many cases, the communities encourage harassment, brigading, and general nastiness. This is going to make the Internet a worse place in general for all of us.",1436576286

(This is something I&#x27;ve been thinking about for a bit, so I&#x27;m not picking on you specifically, you just reminded me of it.)<p>I believe in the power of speech. I believe that there is utility in being able to convey my thoughts, without someone else filtering or censoring them, to others. I believe that my words mean things, that they reflect what I believe. I believe that being a person &quot;of your word&quot; is an important thing: that when you say you will do something, you intend to do it. I believe that lies are, of themselves, clearly of negative moral value. (Which is not to express an opinion on whether lies can serve some greater moral good, just to say that they have inherent demerit.) I believe that if I care about my friends, I care about what they say; if I value my friends, I value what they say; if I respect my friends, I respect what they say.<p>It is out of that conviction that I think that restrictions on one&#x27;s ability to speak, whether from a government or a private party, carry great power, which, like all power, can be abused.<p>If I don&#x27;t assign a moral value to these coworkers&#x27; comments, if I don&#x27;t care what they say, if I don&#x27;t care to have opinions on their speech lest I risk &quot;thought policing&quot; them, if I believe that people may say bad things while intending to be good (or vice versa) and that&#x27;s just okay... it seems that I have completely devalued the power of speech, and I have destroyed the very reason we care about free speech, without censoring a single word. If anyone can say anything and it could mean anything or nothing, and nobody cares, what is the point of speech?",1436576127

So it&#x27;s not so much that we&#x27;re not related to the &#x27;clickbait&#x27; media, it&#x27;s that the media is now mirroring us, unfiltered, and many don&#x27;t realize that this is basically the modern MO of &#x27;news reporting&#x27;.

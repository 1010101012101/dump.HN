But you're definitely right that it's not just a matter of ""companies getting it"", but rather a whole culture feedback loop.",1346061516
4438115,comment,4437431,4438086,8,0,seancribbs,,,"That's still an oversimplification. POST only implies that the request is NOT idempotent, and that the request body is submitted to the origin server for ""processing"". Consider for example, resources that search for other resources via information in the request body and redirect to them. There's nothing wrong with this pattern, and in fact it works nicely for rapidly-changing server-side information since caching the result of a POST is not allowed.<p>The core problem in my mind, is not whether one should insert or update on PUT/POST, but whether one should even be considering HTTP-based APIs to be gateways to what amounts to a database. The domain concepts in the application might not map directly to a resource-centric design, and that's ok. When you focus on the <i>resources</i>, their behavior, and <i>hypermedia</i>, then you ""get"" REST. If your application isn't shaped like HTTP/REST, then maybe it shouldn't try to be.",1346061497

4438113,comment,4437887,4437887,7,0,josemariaruiz,,,"Same situation in Spain, incredible brain drain of IT people. In the last months ~ 40% of my IT colleagues in Spain have decided to move to other countries (UK and Germany mainly).<p>In Spain people a few years ago said stupid things to justify not moving to other countries where salaries were like 3 times Spanish ones: weather, food and quality of life.<p>There is another factor for this delayed and flood-like emigration... FAMILY!. In all Mediterranean countries family is very a strong influence. I even can say that individuals doesn't exists as they are in other countries. A 18 years old in Spain is like a 13 years old in UK. You can be in your 30's and the family will still be pushing you to be in the right path.<p>For many, many years family decided that the best prospect for their young college graduates was, without any doubt, working for the government. In Spain it means a decent salary and a job for life (you cannot be fired under ANY circumstance, ANY AT ALL, you kill someone, go to jail and when you get out your job will be there waiting for you!).<p>Once this absurd situation ended (the government in Spain duplicated its work force in 3 years) the family didn't know how to react. But the government knows better, in the last 3 years the tv programs Spaniard around the world showing happy people living in other countries. So now, the family is pushing their children to go outside.<p>My company is hiring people in London and we only receive CV from Spaniard and Greeks. My boss told me that 1 year and a half ago it was really rare to find people from these countries in selection processed but that now the recruiters are flooded with their CVs.<p>I suspect that the mediterranean IT guy/pal will be the new Polish plumber in UK",1346061468

Most devs want to stay in their country and we don't mind giving them that opportunity.<p>I never understood why people would leave what they love though; be that India or Portugal or whatever; there is plenty to do and live for if you are resourceful and the Portugese I met so far definitely are.<p>It's like when we tried to open an office in Spain; everyone (from the uni there) was complaining there are no jobs and they have to move to Germany. So we opened a company and started recruiting. The people who applied didn't want to work actually. So I asked the university dean and he said; they want jobs for eternity they won't 'risk' anything else. The logic eludes me, but suffice it to say; there are plenty of jobs, there is simply a mismatch between expectations and the jobs provided. Naive expectations. When people go to Germany, expectations lower because it's the promised land. Wages are higher, but the conditions are not better and definitely not what you would have gone for in the 'home land', but they take it anyway because the grass is greener.<p>Having talked to so many people in the south, it's a thing only few people 'get'; you have to embrace the crisis and see the things you can change. It's a turnaround point for all those things which are not well; small things like the difference between the staff in Worten and Mediamarkt. The way to fix the economy must come from many places and this crazy way people treat clients in the south must come to a complete halt. Changing the system from within will work; leaving the country won't, that's just selfish and lazy in a lot of ways. And you have no excuses; there is work, there is opportunity, you just need to try a bit harder as well, it's a crisis.",1346060879

WhatPortIs.com<p>The concept is fairly simple and the current design is basically made up of a landing page from themeforest that I butchered around, however it doesn't render great on some devices, fonts are awful, and you can just generally tell it's not fit for purpose.<p>Finally I want to add a lot more content on the pages which makes this design no longer scalable due to the layout.<p>Basically my problem is that I am not a web designer, web designers are quite expensive for a none profitable side project, and theme forest type designs that are in budget just aren't made with this kind of layout in mind, they are trying to satisfy the masses that want a business or shop website etc.<p>2. route.im<p>So after a few painful days of playing around with HTML/CSS this is what I managed to come up with, it's not amazing but does the job I suppose...<p>Still it doesn't look that appealing and there are also some layout issues.<p>---<p>So I suppose my question is, do i need to bite the bullet and pay for a web designer to create something that actually works?<p>Thanks!

Do you mean tablets or laptop touchpads? That's a HID device and works the same as a mouse does...<p>* Graphics? Yes, Emacs supports graphics and can indeed render PDFs/LaTeX documents using external programs; native image support is usually compiled into Emacs.<p>* Unicode? Emacs has more complete unicode support than you'll find in any other editor out there. What editor let's you open up a subprocess to a commandline tool and have it set such that stdin is treated as UTF-8, but stdout is Cyrillic?<p>> Having more thought, design, and hindsight poured into the UI than the pile of hacks and over the year additions that drive Emacs?<p>* Emacs-Lisp isn't great, but Emacs and elisp is the closest most people will ever get to the spirit of a Lisp Machine. Elisp isn't perfect, but for many it gets the job done. It is also incredibly flexible and its ""naff"" implementation with dynamic scoping <i>improves</i> the spirit of hacking in Emacs by encouraging people to hook, tweak and inject into Emacs's core.
> Having more thought, design, and hindsight poured into the UI than the pile of hacks and over the year additions that drive Emacs?
> Having things more integrated than independent elisp plugins that hardly know each other and don't really collaborate?<p>* Design could be a lot better, but that's what happens when you support the same product for a long long period of time. I know Emacs/Vim will be around in 10 years; will Light Table? Will TextMate?<p>* Most plugins do integrate quite well actually into major modes (the programming modes) such as: Eldoc mode, find-function mode, TAGS support, Imenu, etc. -- it's not perfect, but then again: nothing is?<p>> Rethinking the keyboard shortcut design?<p>* That's just blasphemy. You should observe an experience Emacs guy using Emacs and I think you'll find they're more than capable of accomplishing what they want in few keystrokes.

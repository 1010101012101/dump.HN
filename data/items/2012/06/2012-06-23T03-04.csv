This whole affair seems to me (and I may be wrong) like one judge deciding that the law is bad, and thus that the suits are meritless. While this seems great as long as you agree with the judge's view, I think it opens a pandora's box.<p>Imagine if a right-wing Christian judge tosses out anti-creationism lawsuits, or pro-RIAA judges toss out anti-RIAA lawsuits. Even worse, imagine a judge indirectly on the RIAA payroll! Granted, these are all a long ways away from this case, but I believe that applauding this judge's actions is the wrong reaction.",1340423946

They may once have helped, but no longer.<p>Business people I know believe patents help create entrepreneurship. They think about it from a founder's perspective (they haven't founded companies themselves) and think patents would help that person establish a foothold against incumbents. They ask, ""Without patent protection, how can someone get paid for their creation?""<p>As I see it, the business people don't have relevant experience. They're talking about a myth that doesn't exist anymore if it ever did. People who innovate and create have relevant experience and know how patents and copyright are used in practice.<p>At least this judge understands too.

I've talked with lawyers about this in the past week, and facts, totally rewritten summaries of fact, and collections of facts aren't copyrightable in the US, so it's not really an issue of their content, as far as I understand. They do have a right not to be crawled by me, though, especially if it causes a burden on them. I wrote that crawler specifically to be very light on their servers including making tradeoffs to usability (it never recrawls listings), but that's still their decision to make. If there are ways to get the data that don't involve touching their servers, then the TOU no longer applies, if I understand the law, but it would obviously make them angry, and so I'm most likely not going to do that.",1340422668

First, the importer bought the item and turns around to sell it. That's easy, I bought a DVD and now want to sell it, why should whoever I bought the DVD from have a say with what I do with it. In my opinion the same applies whether it is 1 DVD or 500. This gets real easy if you put it in terms of physical goods. I bought 500 screws from you. Why should you have any say over what I do with those screws after the purchase. If the screw has some kind of copyrighted mark on it the rules shouldn't change.<p>The second case is if in our purchase agreement you add stipulations on what I can do. Then that's easy too. I will buy your 500 screws for a discounted price and agree not to export the screws.

I want to pay someone for it.<p>If the big players (hi, Amazon) don't do it, then set up IaaS as a Service:<p> Push a button and my cloud images move from Amazon to Microsoft Azure to whatever Google's thing is (since that's ostensibly the discussion today). Include RackSpace, Linode, etc. as well for bonus points.<p> Pay the bills for me. If Amazon won't handle migrating my images, I'll pay you 1% on top to take my money, pay the bills, and manage the change in billing when I switch providers. Here's your chance to advertise when you negotiate better deals with a competitor: show me how much money I could be saving.<p> If I push the button, and there are really obvious things about my cloud images that won't work where I'm going - i.e. things you've tried to move and it didn't work for somebody else - detect that and say ""nope, here's what you need to fix."" It's not going to catch everything, but kind of like a virus database it should be constantly updated as you hit problems.<p> I'm not asking you to do the migration for free. Well, if I want a free migration, I have to accept that it won't transfer perfectly and I'll have to debug it. Or, I can pay you an hourly rate to do the migration and set up a test environment on the new platform, and identify any problems.<p>I wish somebody would do that.",1340420985

(And those rights are subject to 109.)<p>602 delineates what is infringement.<p>The dissent in the 2d Cir. case points out that 602 derives from 106.  True, but there's no precedent that says 109 can subjugate 602.  In fact, the S. Ct. in Quality King was quite clear: 602 is broader than 109.<p>If we're atlking about importing quantities of goods for resale in the U.S., either they cannot be imported or the importer will pay dearly in tariffs.  That is how the major American corporations, who lobby for the the copyright laws, doing business globally wanted it.  And that is how it shall be.<p>No court should be saying 109 trumps 602.  This would open the floodgates to parallel imports.  It would allow an industry to flourish that undercuts U.S. pricing, i.e. the prices American companies want to charge Americans.<p>These companies that sell goods in many markets worlwide are already unhappy with countries that allow parallel imports since consumers in those countries can potentially buy goods at the lowest prices worldwide, not just at the price an American company thinks consumers in that country should pay.<p>In sum, it destroys the differential pricing schemes these companies use to maximize profits.",1340420659

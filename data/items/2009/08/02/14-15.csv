It's like the farmers of old that had to deal with the weather without forecasts or even a basic understanding of the driving mechanisms.<p>If your business depends on ONE source of income only, and that source of income goes down the drain you are toast. If you currently have a good income stream from a single source then use all the spare time you've got to build a second one, sooner or later you will need it.<p>And yes, google support sucks. I've yet to get a real and to the point answer to any questions I've ever sent them. Customer service is definitely not their strong suit.",1249225015

It says nothing about the non-durable exports, such as foodstuff.

737475,comment,737260,737260,0,0,kls,,,"One point that the article fails to highlight is, while there is a great demand for embedded programmer, that demand is concentrated in a smaller set of companies than say web development or enterprise systems. That coupled with a lot of the hardware companies moving more and more of their operations to China and Eastern Europe, does not paint a rose picture for heading into the embedded space. Unless you plan to design and market your own products. The mobility of an embedded development career is not as good as a web or enterprise developer and the returns (pay, benefits, security) on some occasions tend to be less than that of other development opportunities.",1249224450

I especially liked the question response (at about 25:00) <i>having a day job as a framework designer is probably the worst thing you could ever do</i>, because if you want to create a tool for developers, it's best if you are intimately engaged with the task that they are, as your day job. Or: <i>scratch your own itch</i>, as the openies say.<p>BTW: Larry Niven (scifi writer) said it's a mistake for writers to give up their day job, because then they run out of raw material (work that seemed a curse was actually a resource).

Finding something worth spending money on is time consuming and near impossible.  Finding something that is free and interesting is also quite difficult.  I monitor Pinch Media's feeds, and filter based on free, but most of the apps are worthless.<p>As for pricing, I think the realistic price for a well developed app is $5-10.  I have spent money on a few games, but most of the non-game apps are either useless or targeted at something outside my wants.<p>A great example of a free app is Word Warp.  It is one of my most frequently used apps.  Supposedly, they make serious cash from advertising.  If it's a game, and worth replaying, you can make good money.

However, I had already verified my cell phone number under my personal domain and couldn't use it again. So, I had to borrow a friend's cell number and get the authorization code from him. However, I was logged into Gmail at the time, so the authorization ended up going on my gmail account.

Marketing is the missing piece for a lot of developers, but having tried a fair amount of marketing ourself (news interviews, print/newspaper, blogs, etc.) — there are some inherent problems  and particularly for indie/bootstrappers.<p>The pricing pressure to .99 distorts consumer's perception of value, therefore your marketing margins are often wiped out if you give in. A lot of people think $.99 is what every app should cost, they really do.<p>It's impossible to get quality metrics on your advertising initiatives. There's no way to really track an accurate conversation so you don't really know what works and what doesn't. You can loosely connect a few stats you setup yourself, but it's pretty weak and time consuming of a process - certainly a step backwards.<p>The inability to offer a demo of your product is a secondary issue with conversation. And, the inability to have a two-way conversation with user reviews, especially the ones that leave arm-chair feedback about your product and have no idea what they are talking about.<p>It's easy to say ""marketing is a quick fix"" for everyones problems.

It seems like something that'd come out of msft marketing.<p>OTOH, what I hear they're doing with the next set of ads -- taking the ""I'm a PC"" and trying to redefine it -- is 100% CP&B and reminds me of other things they've done recently, such as taking burger king nastiness and making it a manly thing.<p>I wonder if Microsoft rejected CP&B's initial idea and pushed for this Seinfeld thing instead. After it completely tanked, they were persuaded to go back to the original idea.",1221735175

And adds bundles <a href=""http://manual.macromates.com/en/bundles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manual.macromates.com/en/bundles</a> which are the killer feature. Jumping between files and methods with shortcuts is nice, too.<p>Of course, it is archievable with VIm but it takes time and you'll constantly find you forgot to mimic TextMate in yet another aspect.",1221735065

Public accusations of the criminality of the unconvicted are legally actionable.\n6) an explanation as to why murderers should be able to walk free if evidence was illictly obtained, but for the most smeared Presidential-ticket candidate in the last century no accusation is too baseless or low.",1221734619

The Linux and Mac clients are very basic, but still work well.<p>With this kind of setup we can take VMs of all the infrastructure, drop them anywhere and still work. We can take our laptops home, move house, sit in a cafe, go overseas and still check code in and out. All been very handy.",1221733920
308063,comment,307584,307584,0,0,ryan-allen,,,"The site appears to promise features that don't exist in the app.<p>From TFA: ""The emails are sent in configurable intervals. If you don't answer the first, you will get a second and a third one. If you don't answer those either, your switch will be activated. Of course, you can have your switch postpone its activation (if, for example, you'll be away for some time) by telling it to not try to contact you for a specified period of time.""<p>Yeah, well I can't find this functionality. It's just a sign up + add an email toy app. What a shame, I wanted to have a fiddle with the settings (in my opinion, the most interesting part).",1221733805

(And I'm guessing that the TC50 judges are at least skeptical as well.)<p>To clarify, I think the augmented reality bit is fake. (Where you point the camera at something to get information about it.) Getting information about which stores are in the area as well as adding comments to a location is neither new nor particularly hard.",1221733513

308056,comment,306933,307633,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Please stop the stereotyping of military service. It's shoddy and it's inaccurate.<p>For most of our country's history, large portions of the population have been exposed to military service sometime in their lifetime. This is the longest period (since the 1970s) where the greatest percentage of people have not had that experience. It's a great social experiment, one that's not generally acknowledged.<p>I'm not going to argue your stereotype. Suffice it to say I have several concrete examples that each of your points are wrong. ""Not even wrong"" would be a better characterization.",1221732160

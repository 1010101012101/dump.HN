There&#x27;s <i>much</i> more going on here.<p>Locks are security for people. If I call a locksmith and he takes over an hour to open or fix my lock, I think, &quot;Oh, good, even a professional is going to take some time to get through this. It&#x27;s pretty secure!&quot; If the locksmith is done in 10 minutes, I think, &quot;Holy shit! With the right tools and know-how, someone can completely bypass my security in ten minutes!&quot; This isn&#x27;t so shocking around here, because most people on HN know just how vulnerable most security systems can be. Many people will not have that knowledge and be comforted by a locksmith taking longer.<p>Also, when you hire a locksmith, you usually watch the locksmith do his work- either because you&#x27;re locked out of something and have to stand around uselessly, or the guy is in your house and it shouldn&#x27;t take too long. This makes you invested in his effort- if it takes an hour, you <i>watched</i> the locksmith work for an hour. It&#x27;s hard not to pay, given that you saw how long it took, and how he was working at it.<p>The same standard doesn&#x27;t seem to apply elsewhere- if my steak takes an hour rather than twenty minutes, I&#x27;m not going to pay more for it, I&#x27;m going to complain to the manager. If the oil change takes too long, I&#x27;m not going to be happy about that, either. If I buy a cabinet, I usually don&#x27;t care if the carpenter took 10 hours or 20, I&#x27;m going to want to pay based on the quality of the cabinet.<p>I think your conclusion is true in <i>some</i> situations, but it&#x27;s definitely not universal to all work.",1422174957

Besides the fact that the company is fully supporting and directing them in their efforts, and to the extent that is not true you would expect equity.

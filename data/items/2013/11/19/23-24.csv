Most importantly, one of those meanings cannot simply be parsed from the direct syntax & vocabulary that make up the phrase, but relies on the cultural familiarity with the phrase and its common usage.<p>I do wonder, though, how long this secondary meaning will last. Right now the dismissive connotation comes about because the phrase stands out, because it breaks the rules in order to be overly brief. If the phrase gets used more, and especially as a new generation never grows up not hearing it, it will not stand out anymore as an unconventional. It could just become grammatical. Without that element, it could easily lose its dismissive connotation.<p>This is kind of exciting to watch, in a nerdy sort of way. Language evolution doesn&#x27;t really happen much in literate societies like ours, so it&#x27;s neat that we have an example unfolding before our eyes.",1384905362

This kind of abuse of Wikipedia&#x27;s reputation by violating Wikipedia&#x27;s terms of service has been going on for years, and even if this group of paid meatpuppets is driven from the site, there are still thousands of articles on Wikipedia that are edited for personal advantage by people who desire to publicize their products or services. I basically can&#x27;t count on any article about a psychological or genetic test on Wikipedia to be neutral, for example, because people are in the business of publishing or distributing those tests, and other people are in the business of administering them. To date, there are still far too few Wikipedia articles that are based on neutral sources such as graduate-level textbooks (preferably used in combination, to detect any bias that might be in one or another of those) and long-form journalism.<p>The only Wikipedia article I can recommend (barely) so far is one I have done a lot to edit.[1] It still needs a lot of work, as does just about every other one of the 4,381,166 articles on English Wikipedia.

If someone finds a piece of great content via organic search on page 10,000 of the SERPS and then links it, great. That&#x27;s possible and I haven&#x27;t precluded the possibility. I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s incredibly unlikely and rarely happens in reality.<p>You are technically correct that given an infinite span of time a blogger who puts no effort into obtaining links will eventually get linked to via users who hit from page 10k of the SERPs. For our purposes as humans who have finite and short lifespans I am not satisfied giving any weight to the presupposition of an infinite timespan. So I reject your argument and state that the vast majority of <i>first backlinks</i> come from marketing, including stuff like telling your friends on twitter that you wrote a blog post, which <i>is</i> marketing.<p>>tons of tons of blogs get the majority of their traffic from Google with no marketing from the blog owner.<p>In practice this rarely if ever happens. Show me a successful blogger who doesn&#x27;t submit her posts to the aggregators, linkbait from forums, share posts on Facebook, do guest blog posts on other blogs, etc. <i>first</i>, before there is a loyal following to do the submitting themselves.<p>SEO and marketing precedes organic growth, always. And probably a lot of what you&#x27;re terming &quot;organic growth&quot; falls under the umbrella of SEO and marketing.<p>>Good content will wind up on sites like this or reddit and backlinks will follow.<p>Once blogs pick up steam this indeed becomes a thing. Before blogs pick up steam it is generally the author or a marketing agency doing the submitting, e.g. marketing.<p>>Google&#x27;s job is to find and display good content to their users<p>Based on a definition of <i>good</i> that Google has defined in a very precise way. Have you read The Paper? G draws the conclusion from a healthy backlink profile that since other people believe the content to be good enough to link to it is probably good. Hence the disproportionate  weight placed on backlink profiles in ranking algorithms vis-a-vis other factors. <i>Backlinks in themselves are a measure of good content</i> according to Google.<p>>Good content is the key ingredient, not SEO and marketing<p>Only insofar as if you market a turd, it won&#x27;t pick up steam. SEO is nothing more than following the rules to get indexed. If you don&#x27;t follow the rules, you won&#x27;t get indexed, and likely won&#x27;t see organic growth from search. The rules state that in order to rank higher, you need backlinks. The backlinks preclude the higher ranking and thus as a logical necessity the growth.<p>>Backlinks are but one of many factors involved in ranking, and their goal is finding good content, not finding the most linked content.<p>For Google, finding the most linked content (combined with assessment of the link profile, e.g. good vs bad neighborhoods etc.) is a means to finding <i>good</i> content. Google cannot assess what makes content <i>good</i> without assessing the backlink profile heavily, because the entire philosophy driving the SERPs is that good = linked to.",1384904680

In pretty much all circumstances that I&#x27;m aware of, the scarcity (in the slightly unconventional sense I&#x27;m using it) and fungibility of gold and silver money is not great -- debasing with cheaper, more common metals resulted in differing standards of purity.<p>Most often, when gold and silver were used as currencies, it was because some dude punched his profile on one side of the coin, and because doing that as a private citizen was difficult and/or punishable by gruesome torture, the value of the money was related to how powerful the head on the coin was because that related to the probability that the coin wouldn&#x27;t turn green.<p>This doesn&#x27;t really answer the question you posed.  Now I&#x27;m totally in the realm of post-hoc reasoning, though, and I can&#x27;t really think of a concrete way of falsifying this argument, but I&#x27;ll go for it anyway.  Gold and silver occur naturally near the surface in relatively pure forms; gold especially since it doesn&#x27;t really allow with anything.  As a result, these metals were present in antiquity, and as systems of money grew up, they were good candidates because people thought they understood the scarcity -- an understanding that turned out to be proven incorrect several times in the history of coinage, with reasonably disastrous impacts on savers in those metals.  Of course, &quot;being used in antiquity&quot; was not one of the properties I defined above.  Arguably fungibility is a factor if the metals were not easily identifiable or distinguishable from other metals.",1384903278

I am not sure how you can say the period 1913-1972 to be under the gold standard when the US government could set the exchange rate to whatever it wanted.<p>One defining feature of <i>representational</i> currency (which is what the currency based on a X <i>standard</i>, as opposed to direct use of commodity X as currency is) is that the currency is <i>redeemable</i> (possibly generally, possibly only for some defined set of holders) for the commodity it represents, which carries the risk that the issuer will alter the redemption rate. (This risk is somewhat mitigated -- but not eliminated -- in a full-reserve gold standard, where all the representational currency is fully backed by gold, but the fact that the issuing entity must have the <i>theoretical capacity</i> to redeem all currency doesn&#x27;t mean that it <i>will</i> do so.)<p>You seem to be confusing the features of a currency baed on a particular commodity as a <i>standard</i> with the features of using that commodity directly as currency. They are related and overlapping (both are subject to volatility caused by supply shortages or gluts in the backing commodity, for instance), and often coexist (its not uncommon for a system with a gold or silver standard representational currency to <i>also</i> use gold or silver specie as currency with equivalent nominal value, though the effective <i>market</i> value may differ between representational notes and specie based on the factors of convenience and perceived risk associated with the government backing the representational currency.)<p>> As soon as you create a central bank, you are not on a gold standard.<p>The existence of a central bank is orthogonal to currency standards, though obviously a central bank has more tools at its disposal in a fiat system than in a gold standard system.",1384902427

While the brand has evolved, the dino had not been updated in quite some time and is no longer the best representation of who we are today.

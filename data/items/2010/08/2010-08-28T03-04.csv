I realize it's not exactly the same because it's not like broadband/streaming/Netflix killed Egghead; however, Egghead and its contemporaries were the only way, at one point, to really see (and salivate over) the latest and greatest software titles.  How many standalone software stores do you see these days?<p>Definitely, the days of the blue-chip brick and mortar movie rental operations are over.

For legal reasons, the creation of any new stock must be authorized by the board of directors, and they don't want to meet every time someone new gets hired; so instead they authorize a pool of stock and tell the CEO to go ahead and hand it out.  So far, so good.<p>The swindle comes here: VCs usually insist on the creation or expansion of an options pool before investing, and <i>count the unissued stock as part of the valuation</i>.  Rather than paying $300k to buy 428571 shares and ending up holding 30% of the company, a VC might insist on the creation of a 20% options pool, with the result that Jack owns 1M shares (50%), there are 400k authorized but unissued shares in the pool (20%), and the VC gets 600k shares (30%) for his $300k.<p>Because those shares <i>don't actually exist yet</i>, the VC actually owns 600k / 1.6M = 37.5% of the company, even though he nominally only bought 30%.",1282964960

If they'd told me they had taken over the company and needed to increase the price by that amount, I would have agreed. Is this a sign that the new owners aren't very good?",1282964483

Many people still using IE regularly probably don't care (or even know) what browser they are using, so if the websites they visit work, they'll probably never think of changing and just take whatever MS puts out.  I think IE9 could come in time to at least maintain their total browser share of around 50% over the next five or so years.",1282964464

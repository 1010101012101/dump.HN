However:<p>""The next version of RepRap will be able to make its own electric circuitry - a technology we have already proved experimentally - though not its electronic chips. After that we'll look to doing transistors with it, and so on...""<p>But... it can't make electric circuits?<p>So now the extended phenotype includes the brain and vital organs too? Basically, all it can make without externally manufactured materials is the plastic joints?<p>I'll tell you what it can make without any extra help: overblown, undeserved hype.",1212771378

That way it's accessible to small communities in the developing world as well as individuals in the developed world. Following the principles of the Free Software Movement we are distributing the RepRap machine at no cost to everyone under the GNU General Public Licence. So, if you have a RepRap machine, you can make another and give it to a friend...</i><p>Open-source hardware in itself is interesting, but viral machines?  Too cool.<p>It reminds me of the olden days of bringing empty cassettes to a friend's place to copy some of their music.",1212770654

Companies that only listened to the desktop market failed, so new entrants (with no existing customers) mostly won.<p>- Change from 3.5"" to 2.5"", largely conducted by incumbent firms as  customers who wanted 3.5"" disks also wanted 2.5"" disks.<p>As always this is harder to do than say :)",1212770398

Levels are shorthand for accomplishment.  Level 51 is the highest in WoW because that's how much content and accomplishment they could determine.  It's entirely arbitrary based on your application.<p><i>All</i> of the reasons are entirely arbitrary based on your application.  It doesn't matter because <i>they are manifestations of psychological principles.</i>  You could have levels, or you could have ducks.  You could have points, or you could have dogs.  Every time you hit Submit in your app you get a dog, and every six dogs you get a parrot, and every three parrots you get a duck, and you need to email that duck to support@yourapp to unlock a new feature, or you can paint that duck a particular color and save it in your right sidebar, but you can't do both.<p>It doesn't matter, because it's not a recipe or a formula.  They are representations of attributes to poke a person's psychology to tell them they are making progress (dogs to parrots), to reassure them (ducks being emailed), to give them investment (ducks being painted), etc.<p>You need to understand the psychological principles involved before any of it will make sense.

The fact is, the business side of news has a lot going against it. The current newspaper model just isn't very viable because ad spending in newspapers continues to go down and page views can't mitigate the decline enough. Subscriptions help, but those dollars tend to flock to really important publications which offer some kind of differentiate product to an affluent client base. E.g.: the WSJ serves the business community and businesses will continue to pay for it.<p>That's very different from something like the Boston Globe, which doesn't offer enough value. Sure, there's local reporting, but I have a feeling that people don't care as much as you'd hope about that and as a result wont be willing to pay up for subscriptions.<p>You can learn programming and R to do some data viz, but it's not going to be enough to counteract the secular decline you're facing as capital exits the industry.<p>Honestly, I think journalism and being a journalist will be a career that eventually goes to rich people / people with other income sources than their primary job.

A person need not be actually\n  gay to be the victim of a gay-bashing hate crime; he need only\n  have been perceived as gay by someone who specifically set out\n  to assault homosexuals. This is only logical, since the\n  terroristic motivation of the assault is present in either\n  case.\n\n  Moreover, the laws protect everyone equally. Majority whites\n  are victims of bias crimes too, and every year there are over\n  a thousand prosecutions for such cases. (Indeed, the\n  definitive Supreme Court case, Wisconsin v. Mitchell, involved\n  a black man accused of fomenting a hate crime against a couple\n  of white teens.)

The counterargument is, ""Well, try for a bit. Show me what you can do if you just start trying.""

So, I would argue that even if you have an interesting job in VC-istan (say, machine learning in an R&D-like environment while your company is flush with cash and management is atypically non-obnoxious) you have a small likelihood of keeping it that way, and you're better off just cashing out if you can.

But you haven't shown an important difference there.  While mom doesn't die from lack of McDonald's, she <i>does</i> die from lack of food, and yet no one uses that a reason to make trite remarks about how we can't possibly allow a free market in food.<p>Rather, they would recognize that we should leave food production to the market, and simply have the government buy from producers, like we do with food stamps, and then concentrate on making sure that such a system doesn't have bizarre implications for the incentive structure.<p>>You can, today, start private clinics which are more ""customer-responsive"" (leave a mint on your pillow, etc.) but how are you going to recoup the costs and in particular, how does that benefit the populace in aggregate?<p>The problem is that you're not going to get reimbursed by the government, no matter how much better your service is per dollar than the existing recipients of the money.  So no, it's not really anything like a fair competition where market incentives bring in new entrants where existing providers suck.<p>The things is, we are <i>already</i> using a market to provide health care to people unavailable to afford it; it's just that the payer is someone else.<p>So it's import to examine the process by which that money is given out, and whether it's encouraging waste, or if it has an incentive to economize on care to get the best outcome per dollar.  And you don't answer that question by saying ""this ain't the market"" (because it largely is) or dismiss it by asking how they're going to get paid (because someone is already paying for these services).",1367187823

Easy.<p>I actually agree with a lot of the things you have to say about the startup world -- there are a ton of idiot hucksters out here who take advantage of naive people, and it's hard to tell them apart from the good folks.  I also agree that many of the products being built down here are pointless and derivative.  But there <i>are</i> good people in this industry, and you, personally, can have a good outcome from working at a startup even if it means that you don't get rich.  And also, just because you get a small percentage of a startup does <i>not</i> automatically mean you're being exploited.<p>You're setting up an implicit false dichotomy: that inexperienced people can choose between the promised land, or fall prey to the scheming machinations of the VC-backed startup world.  But that's crap.  The fact is, most jobs are bad.  The worst jobs explicitly make the trade of units of your life for dollars.  Most are just boring, meaningless, anonymous slogs for some bureaucracy where you can't change anything or even have much of a voice.  Startup jobs, for better or worse, are the some of the only ones you can get as an inexperienced person where you at least have a <i>chance</i> of changing the world in some meaningful way.  That carries value.<p>Personally, I'd rather give up a few dollars in earning potential when I'm young to do something idealistic and bold.   There's really no better place to do that -- right now -- than at a startup company doing something you believe.  Big companies are stable gigs, but designed mostly to keep you in your place (don't make waves, labor unit!)  Academia is a fount of bureaucracy and disappointment.  Research labs are (sadly) dead or dying, or available only to the most senior people.  Startups are selling a dream, but at least they're doing it honestly. Nobody <i>makes</i> you take that startup job.<p>Here's how to handle the nonsense in the startup world:  take control of your life.  If you're a programmer in this world, you're privileged to live in one of the most favorable labor markets in human history, so there's no excuse for complaining about being trapped in a shitty job.  Take the best job you can find...and <i>quit if it sucks</i>.  You'll have a new job in a month.  Don't count on getting rich, because you probably won't.  And if some nimrod gets rich with a derivative iPhone app and you're still working in the salt mines?  Hey....at least you're not selling insurance or writing COBOL in a basement in Albany.  Or literally mining salt.",1367186697

All of those are under the control of the administrators who look out for the bottom line.  Whether complications make money or cost money surely affects administrators' eagerness to revamp and/or enforce handwashing policies, update training for nurses, keep staffing levels high enough that inexperienced nurses are properly supervised, and put pressure on doctors with high complication rates.<p>To make it more concrete, there was an article on HN a few years ago suggesting that post-surgical complication rates could be reduced by creating surgery checklists where very basic surgical steps would be checked off as the surgery proceeded:  patient identity verified, everything properly sanitized, materials accounted for afterwards, things like that.  You would expect a hospital administrator to make a cost-benefit analysis taking into account the cost of researching this idea, creating a trial program, and monitoring compliance and effectiveness.  The cost-benefit analysis looks like this:  If the program is ineffective, we lose money.  If it's effective, we lose even more money.  If it's really, really effective, it could screw up the bottom line so much that I lose my bonus or even my job.",1367186630

Going to prison doesn't mean you're utterly stripped of all of your civil liberties and rights, nor should it.

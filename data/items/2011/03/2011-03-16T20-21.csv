The 'joke' is that if you have to ask the question 'Should I keep my day job?' then the answer is always 'yes'. The reasoning behind this is pretty straight forward, the difference between practitioner and artist is that the practitioner does it because it interests them and an artist does it because they can't conceive of any better use for their time.<p>One way you would know you were passionate about writing books would be that you had moved back into your parents house with your family. That is an action where your passion is expressed by what you do, you sacrifice things that you might buy, or comforts you might enjoy, with a stable income because you are so passionate about your writing that doing it is all you can think of.<p>People with this kind of passion that try to get ""day jobs"" often get fired because they are constantly 'not present' at work, instead they are thinking about their next novel, researching it, creating characters, exploring viewpoints, ""Oh wait, we had a staff meeting at 10, I'm sorry it totally left my mind!"" Happens a lot to people who can't help but be what they are.<p>I also get the whole self confidence thing too, the need for some external validation that you're making the right choice, Etc. But there is only one real measure, and its not opinion, its how widely you are read. How many people relate to your stories? Does it change their life? Does it give them an insight they didn't have? Does it entertain them? I worked as an intern for Jerry Pournelle for a while, not name dropping, just citing the source, he called this understanding of how your writing affected your readers ""finding your voice."" He helped me understand I was a programmer, not a science fiction writer :-)<p>My experience is that nobody can tell you what you should be doing, only your heart can tell you what you should be doing. And by listening to it, and doing it, you will be happy. And of course you will not be wondering if you should be doing something else :-)",1300308555

Not only do they identify unused physical assets (extra space in people's homes/apts.) and create a market for it that undercuts an entire industry, they've created this amazing karmic serendipity of meeting new and interesting people from the very first moment you touch down.<p>Travel isn't just about seeing landmarks and whatnot, it's about immersing yourself in the local culture, and AirBnB provides that much better than most hotels can.<p>Combine the feel-good nature of the service with its recession/depression/financial-crisis/money-saving friendly, disruptive undercutting of a huge industry and I have no doubt they'll eventually be among the biggest incubator successes or exits.<p>And yes, they are growing:<p><a href=""http://blog.airbnb.com/airbnb-celebrates-1000000-nights-booked"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.airbnb.com/airbnb-celebrates-1000000-nights-book...</a><p>I do wonder if they'll compete with Couchsurfing.com.  The latter could pivot a little and offer the same kind of for-pay service AirBnB does, and already has a huge clientel.<p>Edit: just to elaborate on the recession-friendly bit.  I've gotten very interested lately in companies like AirBnB and Groupon that enable people to continue spending despite adverse financial conditions, be it deflationary or inflationary.  In the former, cash and credit becomes scarce, and in the latter cash loses its value and prices increase.<p>In either case, AirBnB has found an asset that has historically been priced at $0, and can hence undercut competitors all the way down to 0$.  No established hotel can compete on price, only amenities, but in times of financial distress, customers tend to sacrifice amenities for lower prices.  And what AirBnB can't offer in amenities, it compensates for with the social aspect that hotels can't offer.<p>Same with Groupon, they've created a win-win-win for the most part.  Customers save money if the Groupon was something they wanted anyway, companies make money (assuming they did the math right on their deal), and Groupon makes money.  Only the companies that people would have spent money on, but spent on a Groupon instead, lose, which is extremely difficult to quantify.<p>I don't know how much of this the AirBnB and Groupon founders foresaw, but I think both are brilliant.  They've really got me trying to think up something similar now.",1300308520

It's a terrible disaster, and our minds are ill-suited to deal with anything of this scale. My heart goes out to the Japanese and I'll do anything I can do to help.

Conforming to some black-and-white, over-the-top view of the world is an indulgence that we can have because we are so far away. The Japanese have work to do, and that involves taking an honest look around and reminding themselves that there is a huge amount of stuff that is not broken.<p>I enjoy contrarian articles - both writing them and reading them -- because it reminds me how easy it is to cut corners and go from ""horrible disaster"" to ""all is lost!""

As boiling is the point at which water becomes vapor, if nothing else the ponds will eventually boil dry.<p>We also know that the spent fuel pools require cooling and that all power has been cut to the plant so there is no cooling.<p>Temperature rise in the pond will be a function of how many fuel rods are present and the amount of U235 in those rods (are they 'new' waiting to be installed, or 'old' waiting to be disposed? I don't know and its not clear from what I've read what there relative age is.) The uranium is decaying to lead [2] and as it decays, and its decay products decay. It generates heat. Not enough heat to be a useful source of energy, but certainly enough heat to keep the water boiling.<p>My speculation is that since the other electrical infrastructure has been severely damaged around the plant (and they do not have power back yet [3]) that the equipment that was responsible for circulating water in the pond through convection coolers isn't running and natural convection has either been disrupted or is insufficient to keep the water temperature down.<p>This combines to allow the water to boil, and if the spent fuel rods in the water were to be uncovered, there is sufficient U235 remaining in the rods present for the group to reach crititcality.<p>""why aren't isn't the fuel pallets in these ponds spaces so far apart that one could never interact with another under any circumstances?"" because the contingency plans did not include a triple failure of main power, diesel backup, and battery backup.

I'm certain that professional/user ratio is in strong favour of Linux.<p>Idea that companies put money into R&D solely due to intellectual property, or that they only make enough to put something into R&D because of IP is wrong.<p>Look at some of the most successful businesses in the world. Selling sugared water, selling grilled pieces of meat, selling washing machines and various appliances, selling pieces of wood that fit together,...<p>Taking whatever IP from them wouldn't change their R&D and other forward looking spending activities much.<p>And don't come back to me with low tech/high tech argument. High tech production is even harder, that's why those who know how to do it and keep successfully investing into getting beter, get to run the show. Those who don't know how to improve and those who want to collect tax on everybody forever should just roll over and die.",1300305838

Both serif and sans serif work and you can get away with a fonts that have more ""personality"" than readability.<p>Body text, however, should be optimized for readability so your choices are more constrained.  I don't think there is a huge difference in readability for serif vs. sans serif fonts for body copy.  Ask a couple of designers and you'll get a couple of different opinions.  Some will say that serif fonts are better because the serifs ""lead the eye along"".  I'm not sure I buy that, but I do prefer serif fonts for body copy.  But if you use a serif font, make sure it is big enough.  At small sizes the serifs don't render well and get in the way of readability.<p>I've heard that Arial works better as a display font instead of a font for extended reading, which I tend to believe since it looks so much like Helvetica.  If I choose a sans serif font for body copy, I choose Verdana which was specifically designed for the screen.  But really, I don't think Arial is necessarily a bad font for body copy.  I don't have any objective reason to say why you shouldn't use Arial.<p>Also, the header font and the body font should contrast, so if you have a serif header font it's usually good to have a sans serif body font and vice versa.",1300305828

Redwood is the result.<p>Redwood is a ""Spotlight for your web apps"" -- it searches Basecamp, GMail, and GDocs from one search bar on your desktop. We'll add more sources going forward. Or, you'll be able to write your own plugins in Ruby, to search whatever you want. Download: http://redwoodapp.com/system/Redwood.zip. OSX 10.6 or later required.<p>## A little technical background on the app:<p>* It's written primarily in MacRuby 0.10 (trunk). You don't need MacRuby installed -- it's embedded in the application bundle.<p>* We use two gems: Nokogiri and GData, also embedded in the application bundle. We use macruby_deploy --gem, which makes gem bundling a breeze.<p>* We use a few Obj-C libraries: Sqlite3 for DB, FMDB for DB wrapper, ASIHTTPRequest for HTTP.<p>* the UI is rendered primarily in HTML/CSS, and events are passed back and forth between an embedded Webview and Cocoa.<p>Please give it a whirl, we'd appreciate any feedback.

The Western media have made the Fukushima nuclear plant the most salient aspect of this tragedy, not least because of the politics and economics of the King Kong vs Godzilla battle being waged by the US coal and nuclear power industries, and other sorts of political battles in Europe. The need for humanitarian aid remains huge. Moreover, this is something most Americans actually can provide -- unlike advice on stopping nuclear meltdowns.</i>",1300305712

Our minds are primed with pre-built language circuitry and as children we pick up the specifics of our environmental language effortlessly.<p>The learning we do throughout our post-infancy lives bears no resemblance to language learning. It is done using that effortlessly-acquired language structure, but in itself it takes hard work and effort. Unlike language, it goes ""against the grain"" of our evolved instincts. It can indeed be catalysed through judicious social interaction - comparing results, swapping tips, etc. - but the core of adult learning is focused, isolated study. Social environments for learning are a supplement, useful in moderation, but usually destructive and much more likely to result in groupthink, lowest-common-denominator mediocrity, and poor efficiencies in failing to optimise for the wide range of needs and aptitudes distributed among individuals when used in excess.",1356832694

4984231,comment,4981995,4982856,1,0,csense,,,"For games, there are two different parts of the physics simulation:  Integrator and collision detection/response.<p>The integrator uses a lot of math.  It gives the positions of everything at time t and time t+D, where D is the timestep.  The integrator functions under the assumption that no collisions occur.<p>The collision detection/response system takes as input the integrator's output, namely the positions of everything at time t, and at time t+D.  It finds the earliest collision, say at time t+d where d < D, and does something about it -- usually changing position and velocity of the objects involved -- and then re-runs the integrator from time t+d to t+D, again stopping to process the earliest collision.<p>The important point is that your results are ""good enough"" if the collision detection just assumes objects travel in a straight line at constant velocity between their positions at t and t+D.  The exact path is something that's confined to the integrator, and only linear paths exist in the simulation outside of it.<p>Of course there are various optimizations and corner cases you have to take care of -- like making sure colliding objects don't immediately register a second collision when the integrator is restarted, and bounding the number of collisions an object is allowed to experience per frame (to handle for example a ball resting in a V-shaped cup from alternating collisions between the two pieces of the cup thousands of times per frame).<p>And you can optimize since you don't actually have to re-run the integrator for objects that didn't change their physics state (position/velocity) due to the collision.",1356832602

But if it's a free software database system, the code is open, and I don't really see that as ""lock in"". For comparison, if you write an application in ruby, you don't say that you are ""locked in"" to ruby.<p>""I think an API is a lot cleaner""<p>That can work very well, but it does have some weaknesses. For instance, you may see a check in the API code for out-of-bounds values, and assume your code doesn't need to account for it. But then you hit some out-of-bounds data at runtime, because the data was inserted before the check was added. That's why databases offer many declarative constraints, so that if you see it, you know it's true, and don't have to worry about when the constraint was created.<p>That being said, I think a lot of applications would be better developed using something like a web service to cleanly separate the human interface from the action being taken.

4984190,comment,4981995,4981995,1,0,t3hprogrammer,,,"I've done a lot of amateur research into this field, but I am by no means an expert. Either way, I have a few comments. Let's take this line for example:<p><pre><code>  ball.y += ball.vy;
  ball.vy += gravity;
</code></pre>
It looks okay and seems to match the constant acceleration kinematics formulas, but what we're really doing is Euler integration, a first-order numerical integration method. It's pretty bad even for numerical integration, so we should use fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) instead [1].<p>Taking a look at the collision detection, look at this line of code:<p><pre><code>  ball.y = platform.y - ball.radius;
</code></pre>
It works in the given situation, of course, but wait a minute - if the ball is moving at 5 cm/frame and, at that particular frame, happens to be 1 cm above the platform, then the ball will move only 1 cm/frame! This means that the velocity has apparently dropped to some nonsensical value! But we can't move it anywhere else, because we haven't checked for collisions yet, and this example also assumes that there is only one other platform the ball could collide with - if it was an acute corner of two platforms, then we're in a bit of a rough situation.<p>Lastly, in this particular line of code:<p><pre><code>  ball.vy *= -0.4;
</code></pre>
The value, 0.4, is called the coefficient of restitution. In his particular case, where the platform is immovable, it's fairly reasonable (if we had immovable objects in reality!) but obviously a more sophisticated collision will need to consider energy factors.<p>Conclusion? Collisions are hard [2]!<p>[1] <a href=""http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/integration-basics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/integration-basics/</a><p>[2] ftp://www.myphysicslab.com/beta/Collision-methods.html",1356831840

What is it to be a prick? To acknowledge realities regardless of the fact that other people may find them uncomfortable?<p>All of these things are useful, You can't plan affirmative action programs or associated actions to address problems with ethnic groups unless you can quantify what those problems actually are. You can't address the real problems with gender equality if you simply swallow all the propaganda on one side of the argument and instantly think you have the whole story.

The alternative to open data is closed data. That doesn't get the unwashed masses access to data engineers, it just loses them access to data that corporations and wealthy people continue to have.<p>If I was to point out a problem with open data, it's that it has the potential to break our social institutions by facilitating aggressive min/maxing behavior on a large scale. It's not that Goldman Sachs is going to use the data against the general public -- they're going to do that whether the data is public or private -- but you make it public and then the middle class can use it against the poor (and then the poor are going to revolt).<p>For example, suppose we create a good, easily accessible map of places to live and put down all the information someone in the housing market would like to know: Home prices, tax rates, quality of the schools, etc. Now home buyers can min/max those variables when making a purchasing decision. In general that's good -- when we buy a home, having that information benefits us. We can find a place that has extremely low taxes when we don't have kids in school, and choose between the places with excellent schools to find the one with the lowest taxes when we do.<p>But then local governments react by trying to find a niche. They let their schools go straight to hell in order to attract childless professionals through low tax rates. Or they zone all the low cost housing out of the school district so that they can maintain good schools at a low mill rate because everyone who can afford to live there is affluent. What they most certainly don't do is provide good schools or other government services to poor people, because that has a deleterious effect on the value for money that middle class people are looking for when they're shopping for a tax jurisdiction, and when they do that they lose their tax base and thereby their ability to continue doing it.<p>Of course, such things happened before public data, but you make the data more widely available and you make the behavior more common.<p>And before the libertarians get too happy about this state of affairs, recall that the de facto default defense against aggressive competition is collusion. Which we [pretend to] ban in the private sector, but between governments they just call it centralization and ""federal standards"" and impose it on you from the top down the second they can break a filibuster. Which is, of course, miserable and inefficient because it destroys local control and creates a systemic failure if they get it wrong.<p>Which isn't to say that the data availability is net negative. The incentive it provides is for governments and corporations to be efficient, and efficiency is <i>usually</i> (indeed almost always) beneficial. But the data lets the user of the data decide what to optimize for. So the problem comes when the thing we choose to optimize for as individuals is not the thing we would choose to optimize for as a society.",1356830539

4984109,comment,4977056,4983180,3,0,alexqgb,,,"Easy, tiger. My point is that anyone who thinks this question is a fair and reliable way to suss out character flaws should think twice.<p>Again, what you did (asking a question when the answers were right in front of you) indicated that you neither knew or cared enough to actually read what others were saying. I promise you, this is not a good look. Disagreeing with the answers is one thing. But behaving as though they don't even exist is another. And given what we're discussing, this obliviousness is entirely relevant to the conversation in that it demonstrates that people aren't necessarily aware of their own shortcomings, at least not to the point where they can enumerate them crisply, completely, and professionally. Even a modicum of self-awareness (which you seem to lack) should make this clear.<p>And no, this observation doesn't constitute an ad hominem attack. Were the personal factor irrelevant (e.g. ""How could we trust you with the company's finances? You're a woman!"") then it would be. But that's because it introduces a logical fallacy (thinking women, by their nature, can't handle finance), not because it's disparaging. There's no rule of debate that says people can't say things that are true simply because it could cause others to take offense. As long as things they're saying are accurate and relevant, they're fair. That's why saying ""We can't trust you with the company's finances. You're a convicted embezzler!"" is not an ad hominem attack, even though a person's character is clearly the subject. Given the circumstance, character is entirely relevant. Indeed, it would be illogical NOT to mention it.<p>Now, it should be clear that there is nothing irrelevant about an overlooked weakness that exists in a speaker who is busy arguing that people who are unprepared to discuss their weaknesses are either lazy or dishonest. Obviously, you'd be unprepared to discuss your own weakness if you needed to, and not because you're lazy or dishonest. It's because you're human, just like the rest of us.<p>The problem with humans is that a lot of them are stupid. They ask stupid questions and draw stupid conclusions from the answers they receive. Smart people learn to identify the stupid ones fairly swiftly, and after having been burned by stupidity, they learn to evade it when necessary.<p>Few questions telegraph stupidity more reliably that ""Tell me about your weakness?"" You may think it's a great question, but as we've seen, you rank fairly low on the self-awareness scale and your idiotic judgements about people who are uncomfortable with it (""Lazy unprepared liar!"") just confirms smart people's deepest fears about what goes on inside the heads of people who think this question is a great way to get reliable information.",1356829977

The alternative is that you can use the full configuration that has more boilerplate but lets you configure everything.

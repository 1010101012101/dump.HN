7376765,comment,7375642,7376635,2,0,dap,,,"> What bodyfour is proposing is not just getting a write-notification -- it&#x27;s in tandem with being able to specify write ordering. If you need to be able to specify write ordering, you also want to be able to have a write notification.<p>It&#x27;s still not enough: with write ordering and notification but no instruction to actually write the data soon, the kernel can buffer it indefinitely.<p>If you want the data on disk, use fsync().  If you don&#x27;t care, don&#x27;t.  If the problem is that you can&#x27;t afford the latency imposed by the multiple fsync() calls required to ensure correct data ordering for your application, fine.  But that&#x27;s not the problem the OP talks about.  That was about fsync() hammering the I/O subsystem.  You can solve that problem by fixing the fsync() implementation.<p>> fsync does not work because it returns when everything (in the same thread? or whatever) has been written to disk, and doesn&#x27;t let you wait for a particular block to have been written.<p>If you really want that, could you mmap(2) the file and use msync(2)?<p>For this as well as the other cases described (e.g., wanting write ordering), I don&#x27;t know what the intended use case actually is, but is it possible that there&#x27;s another way to organize the data that&#x27;s still correct and performs well <i>without</i> changing the POSIX interface?  It seems likely, given the number of different programs out there that manage to get by with it, and there&#x27;s a rather significant cost to adding a new interface.<p>(One option is to write everything you need into a temporary file, fsync() it, then synchronously rename it to &quot;commit&quot; it.  That still requires two fsync&#x27;s, but never more than that.  You can generalize this for multiple files using a temporary directory.)<p>FWIW, I typically work on illumos systems.  On fsync(), ZFS records only an intent log record.  That alone helps, since it&#x27;s not stopping the world to write out everything that&#x27;s been buffered.  For particularly latency-sensitive applications, we use a separate intent log device on an SSD.  (Regardless of write ordering and filesystem optimizations, an SSD is necessary in order to guarantee something is on stable storage with latency better than spindles can provide.)  This configuration works very well.",1394499265

In most cancer studies the groups are defined by the <i>stage</i> of the cancer, which means all patients with, say, &#x27;testicular cancer, non-seminoma stage IIIc (bulky)&#x27; will get put together in the same group, independent of age, physical condition, access to excellence centers, psychological conditions, etc. But obviously a healthy 19 year old with a supportive family, access to good doctors and a strong will to live will fare much better than a 60 year old with a compromised immune system and a late diagnosis. That&#x27;s not even accounting for selection bias (certain cancers happen mostly to people in a certain age range, say 45-60, or 15-30 in the case of testicular cancer) so the average survival rate is <i>even more</i> skewed.<p>In other words, if he was healthy before the cancer and keeps his morale up, he&#x27;s got a <i>great</i> chance to be in the 35%! Tell him not to despair. Chemo is a bitch, getting an infection while neutropenic is no joke (I got two pneumonias in a period of 3 months, <i>worst pain ever</i>) and there&#x27;s every reason to feel like shit. But once it&#x27;s over, it&#x27;s like having a new chance at life and it gives you a completely different perspective.<p>Please feel free to PM me.",1394499011
7376747,comment,7372913,7373479,3,0,robomartin,,,"> It&#x27;s kind of disappointing that developers aren&#x27;t self-aware enough to understand that they are essentially screwing themselves by not moving quickly in dropping &quot;legacy&quot; support.<p>I think the part that might be missing from your line of reasoning is context:  For professionals and entrepreneurs programming isn&#x27;t a hobby, it&#x27;s a business.<p>The decision to stay with 2.x isn&#x27;t about not being self-aware.  It&#x27;s about being serious about your business.  Business has nothing to do with self-awareness.  It would be irresponsible to send your organization down a path that could result in a huge setback.<p>If you are self-funded this could absolutely kill you.  If you are in a competitive environment where time to market is crucial (who isn&#x27;t) this could kill you.  If you have investors who expect you to make responsible decisions, they could kill you.<p>How are you going to explain the decision to go to 3.x when the fertilizer hits the ventilator and you realize there are three choices in front of you:<p><pre><code>    1- Redo your entire codebase to migrate down to 2.x.\n    2- Launch a new project to rewrite the 2.x libraries you need.\n       This could take one week or one year.\n    3- Shut it down because you don&#x27;t have enough cash to deal \n       with having made the wrong decision.\n</code></pre>\nAnd, here&#x27;s the kicker:  You won&#x27;t know until you hit that wall.  Sure, you can do an initial dependencies survey.  And hope you went deep enough.  By definition, you will have no way to check dependencies you don&#x27;t know about at the start of the project.<p>The bottom line is that in the context of a real business --not a hobby-- sticking with 2.x is probably the only responsible choice for a huge number of organizations.  I really think the Python leaders made a mistake in not coming up with a smooth on-ramp onto the various ideas in 3.x.  I do understand that some things need to be broken sometimes.  In the real world you can only break so much of a codebase before people avoid it like the plague.<p>Here&#x27;s the other reality:  The customer doesn&#x27;t give a damn whether you are using 2.x, 3.x, Python, Lisp, PHP or assembler.  They buy your product or use your service because of the value they derive from it.  For the vast majority of businesses and customers this has nothing whatsoever to do with the technology choices you make behind the scenes.  If this fact isn&#x27;t obvious, study the history of a number of prominent startups and you&#x27;ll find support for this idea.<p>It&#x27;s easy to fall back on engineering think and forget reality.  I do it all the time.  Over the years I&#x27;ve become better at avoiding thinking like that.  Like wanting to build a product without doing market research and, a year later, finding out the hard way nobody wants it.<p>I&#x27;m not criticizing you here.

7376648,comment,7376113,7376113,5,0,api,,,"&quot;How to explain the rise of Neil deGrasse Tyson? It’s hard to deny that we live in an era in which science — as both a worldview and as a practice — is under near-constant assault. On the left, there are those who rail against the dangers of GMOs and vaccines. On the right, there are those who deny climate change and the evolution of species.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve thought about this a lot. I know a number of highly intelligent and articulate people who seem to hold a kind of animosity toward science, and in talking to them I always try to figure out exactly why this is.<p>I&#x27;ve identified what I think are several reasons.<p>(1)<p>Science is about reality. It&#x27;s about learning about reality and a commitment to reality. Unfortunately for a great many people reality just flat out sucks and there&#x27;s little they feel they can do about it.<p>You&#x27;re stuck in a dead-end job with debts piling up, an underwater house, and failing health. The last thing you want to hear about is <i>reality</i>. You want unreality-- the more unreal the better-- because your reality is awful and then you&#x27;re going to die.<p>(2)<p>There has been a general loss of confidence in institutions, scientific and academic ones included.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is wholly irrational. We&#x27;ve had multiple presidential administrations that have lied us into war. The financial industry has run what amount to pump-and-dump scams against the public (e.g. the housing bubble). These sorts of things show people that institutions aren&#x27;t to be trusted. They are often either predatory or incompetent.<p>What&#x27;s that got to do with science?<p>Well... from an ordinary person&#x27;s point of view, science belongs to the same stratospheric realm as high finance and government. It&#x27;s part of the world of &quot;big&quot; things... &quot;big&quot; things that stomp on the little guy.<p>(3) (and I think this might be the big one)<p>Science says things that are concrete and falsifiable. Since humans are not infallible, that means that some of what you say is almost certainly going to turn out to be wrong.<p>Superstitious ideologies on the other hand seldom make concrete promises or provide answers that are actually testable or verifiable. As a result, they are never wrong. They&#x27;re never wrong because they are not really saying anything. (Politicians and salesmen are also masters of this art... it&#x27;s not by any means confined to religion.)<p>Every time science makes a mistake, it counts against it in peoples&#x27; minds. &quot;Oh, they were wrong about trans fats... that means GMO foods can&#x27;t be trusted either!&quot;",1394497425

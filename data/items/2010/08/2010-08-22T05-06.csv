1624293,comment,1624250,1624250,0,0,VengefulCynic,,,"If you do a bit of digging around on the City of Philadelphia website, you will find the following text under the Description of the Business Privilege Tax section:<p>""Every individual, partnership, association and corporation engaged in a business, profession or other activity for profit within the City of Philadelphia must file a Business Privilege Tax Return, whether or not they earned a profit during the preceding year.""(<a href=""http://www.phila.gov/revenue/pdfs/Rev%20PDFs/BPT_internet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phila.gov/revenue/pdfs/Rev%20PDFs/BPT_internet.pd...</a>)<p>Basically, this is a $300 one-time licensing fee to conduct a business from a property within the City of Philadelphia.<p>There are two types of examples that this article uses:<p>1) Home-based ""I'm just dicking around and use Google ads to offset the cost of my basic Wordpress subscription and server"" bloggers.  This seems kind of shady to me and I would be really interested to see about what an actual accountant and/or lawyer would have to say about this.  After all, this is someone going asking the City of Philadelphia's Revenue Department if they have to pay more taxes.  That's like going to a divorce lawyer and asking if you need a divorce... of COURSE the answer is going to be ""yes.""<p>2) Home-based business that turns no profit - Regardless of the profitability of a business, in the United States (and most everywhere else in the world) you have to pay the relevant city/state/county/federal licensing/inspection/regulatory/screw-you fees.  That's the way running a business is. Don't like it? Don't run a business (out of your house or otherwise) if you can't make peace with that.<p>All in all I find this article to be long on rhetoric, anecdote and high-minded moralizing and short on details and investigative journalism. Were I a denizen of the City of Philadelphia and concerned about this, I would put in a couple of hours of research at the reference desk of the public library and wait for some better analysis on this subject from a slightly more reputable source before shelling out for this fee.",1282456681

1624290,comment,1623629,1623629,0,0,koeselitz,,,"When I was very, very young, I once made said to my parents that I was glad I lived with my family, because if I lived all alone in a big apartment in a city, I would feel very lonely. And I remember - this is one of my most vivid early memories - that my father stopped what he was doing, sat down, and explained to me that someday I might find myself living in that kind of situation. Even then I could tell this was very personal to him - like he'd been in that situation himself. And, he told me, even if I found myself living 'all alone,' and even if I thought I was in a place where no one cared about me, or thought about me, or even had contact with me at all - I wouldn't be. He told me that there would always be people all around me, so I'd discover, if I looked around, that people just next door, people just a few feet away from me, were always right there, communicating with me on a certain level. I only had to pay attention.<p>It's nice to have that sort of confirmed by this study. Because of that impression, it's always made sense to me that this is true; cities are interconnected systems, and every member is dependent in some way on every other, no matter how solitary that person may think she or he is. I think we've built up a lot of mechanisms today whereby it's easy to tell ourselves that we're very lonely; all that's needed to remove that sensation of being alone is a simple observation of the basic fact that we're constantly and continuously interacting with the people around us, even if it seems like we're not.",1282456376

1624287,comment,1624250,1624273,0,0,credo,,,"regarding your suggestion .....how is a blogger going to know whether his new blog is going to net $10/year or $1000/year without turning on ads and therefore paying the $300 fee ?<p>Here in Washington state, businesses are required to pay 1.5% Business tax. However, if the business earns less than $28,000, the govt does not collect any taxes. I think a sole proprietorship business license (for a real business, not a blog) costs $15.<p>imo charging $300 for a license to run a blog with ads is high. Not exempting low-revenue blogs from the $300 fee is also absurd.",1282456137

1624283,comment,1624038,1624182,0,0,naturalized,,,"Actionscript 3.0 is much more sophisticated than Javascript/HTML5. The capabilities of HTML5 are equivalent to Actionscript1.0/Flash Player 6, circa 2004 (these demos were entirely possible even in Flash Player 5 perhaps). Plus, Flash is reasonably cross-platform (except for iPhone/iPad of course).
On another note, making embeddable widgets (slideshows, videos with more than just viewing functionality, like Youtube) is very hard in Javascript, since any complex embedded Javascript would likely clash with other scripts on the page (we have experienced this, making a complex Javascript widget, that ended up clashing with Adsense ads of our customers, it was a nightmare to debug that).<p>Incidentally, I brought up my task manager while viewing these demos, the CPU utilization jumped from 5% to 97% (Core 2 Duo, 1.66 GHz).",1282455975

1624279,comment,1624250,1624273,0,0,cjy,,,"Just because the law applies equally to everyone, doesn't make it a reasonable law.  It's dumb to charge every entity that brings in revenue a $300 license fee.  From the sounds of it, this law applies to every kid who shovels snow or mows a couple of lawns in the summer.  How about if you have a yard sale or sell your motorcycle through the classifieds?  When does a person become a business?  What this law ends up doing is encouraging people to lie about any minor sources of income they receive.  Activities that are done primarily for pleasure should not be treated like businesses in the tax code.  That's just unreasonable.",1282455741

1624273,comment,1624250,1624250,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"EDIT: Perhaps I was unclear in my comment below. I am by no means endorsing this law. I think it is unreasonable and I do not agree with it. However, that is a separate issue than the question of whether or not the law applies to bloggers trying to make money from their blog, given that the law was already in place. /EDIT<p>When I first started reading this, I was outraged. ""This is a violation of free speach!"" I thought, acknowledging that such a law restricts public writing and blogs to those who can afford it.<p>Then, halfway through the article, it finally clarifies the city's stance with this:<p><i>[...] the city requires privilege licenses for any business engaged in any ""activity for profit,"" [...] So even if your blog collects a handful of hits a day, as long as there's the potential for it to be lucrative — and, as Mandale points out, most hosting sites set aside space for bloggers to sell advertising — the city thinks you should cut it a check.</i><p>So, the city requires a business license fee from anyone setting up shop to make money. And by putting ads on your blog, that's exactly what you're doing. This seems reasonable to me.<p>To the Philidelphia bloggers complaining that they have to pay a $300 licensing fee even though they only make $5-$20 per year from ads, I have some advice: remove the ads. It's not worth it. In fact, why would you undermine your blog's credibility [1] for a few measely dollars in the first place?<p>[1] See item 9 on <a href=""http://credibility.stanford.edu/guidelines/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://credibility.stanford.edu/guidelines/index.html</a>",1282454952

1624271,comment,1623022,1623277,0,0,rdtsc,,,"As someone mentioned, I think this is a media test and a warning of the things to come.<p>They probably asked 2 women to cry ""rape"" to see 1) how media and people would react and 2) to discredit him. It doesn't matter if charges never stick -- it discredits him by creating doubt. It is the basic ""OJ trial"" situation -- ""just because we couldn't convict doesn't mean he is not guilty"" -- so just convicting someone and having all the media report it, is enough to tarnish Julian's morality image.<p>And it just so happens that Julian and Wikileaks is on a higher moral ground and that is what keeps them popular. They are the modern day information Robin-Hoods. If they can be made to look immoral their image and credibility will forever be destroyed. No matter if charges don't sick.<p>As for the warning. I think some operations that CIA engages are intentionally not kept too secret as to serve as a warning and intimidation without actually putting in a press release. It is basically the same tactics that FSB (ex KGB) used when they assassinated Litvinenko. They could have probably arranged an armed robbery or freak car accident, but by using radioactive polonium with traces all the way to the Sheremetovo, they issued a loud and clear threat to anyone willing to criticize or betray the FSB in the future.",1282454857

A lot of people are comparing it to an outbox, but while the two are functionally similar, they are psychologically different.  The undo send simply gives you a few extra seconds to re-read your email and catch any small errors before sending.<p>When the feature first launched, I was worried I would eventually adjust to it, and stop re-reading emails before clicking ""send"".  So far, that has not happened - it's effectively a psychological trick that continues to make my emails better proof-read.",1282454255

They assassinate Pakistanis even as we speak using UAVs piloted from Langley.<p>As for Julian. Well, I think the best way to deal with him is to smear his moral stance. You see Wikileaks is presented  to the world as standing on a high moral ground, fighting a warmongering and murderous giant empire. It is the classic ""good little guy"" vs ""big bad guy"" battle. So far the little guy is doing very well.<p>So the best way to deal with Wikileaks ""problem"" is to pop its moral balloon. Implicate them in child porn, rape, molestation -- anything that would completely discredit them. And it just looks like Julian has actually been accused of rape in Sweden, a country he just happened to set up some of his servers and where he planned on staying a while. Maybe it's a coincidence and not connected to the CIA at all -- but somehow I doubt it.<p>On another point. I think if any of the adversary intelligence agencies managed to actually assassinate him and made it look like a CIA job -- it might turn into a major win for them by making CIA look bad.",1282453801

3411980,comment,3411877,3411921,0,0,silencio,,,"Depends on the book and how fast you read. Most of my books were quick one-time reads, not that many mindbending or thoughtful books in the mix like the link contains. I think I read 30 minutes to an hour or so a day (while waiting for things like flights and people for dinner or at the supermarket checkout lane, before bed, at the gym) and this year I've read thirty thousand pages across 61 books (soon to be 62 if I can sit down to finish my current read, <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/review/stats/2444699-jane"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goodreads.com/review/stats/2444699-jane</a>). That's not counting magazines, blogs, RSS, HN, and technical books for work, just pure pleasure reading for me.<p>When your primary method of reading is via iPhone and it's always with you, there will always be opportunities to read. But in exchange, I don't do much of other hobbies. My TV watching has fallen significantly to only 3-4 shows at best and maybe one movie a week, for example.<p>I'm currently on a pretty carefree contract work lifestyle right now though, so YMMV.

I'm making up numbers, but lets say your rate is $100, and the recruiter's % is 40% of your rate.  Now the company sees $140/hr.<p>The company may not object to your rate if they found you directly, but your rate + recruiters expense is more than they were expecting.

3411978,comment,3411769,3411769,0,0,wcgortel,,,"It's true that the banks aren't really as concerned with maximizing an investor's return in their wealth management divisions, but it's also worth noting that they maybe shouldn't be engaged in that sort of activity. The likelihood that the random fellow you happen to meet at Morgan Stanley actually has an edge on beating the market is  small enough to be irrelevant.<p>However, there's still some value in having a human who's somewhat familiar with you and your personality pick up the phone when you call to execute a trade. Most of the value that advisers offer is getting you to stay in the market over time by keeping you from making stupid decisions. They're certainly incentivized to do so, but a lot of investors lose out by making thoughtless, fear-driven decisions to buy and sell. The actual amount that they lose out varies, but I've seen a range of around 2-8% in a number of studies. This [1] says average investors lag the index by 5% a year, which I'm inclined to believe.<p>Part of the issue that Murtza is likely experiencing is that this psychological function of a financial adviser--getting people to keep their investments in place over the long term--does not feel good. In fact, it feels like lying and it is.<p>The question for most investors isn't whether they can get a better return by switching to a passively managed fund, but rather whether they have the discipline to manage their own investments when they get scared/exuberant. This is not to say that advisers aren't prone to the same behavioral defects, but it's probably better to have someone on the other end of the phone who will try to get you to explain why you're selling out or buying in.<p>The problem for a lot of employees--particularly in the private wealth space--is that they think they're getting involved in some mythical ""Wall Street,"" which doesn't really exist. Good advisers are 90% Mom (calms you down when you're excited) 10% psychiatrist (gives you tools to help yourself). They are not investors. They are in the business of preventing harm.<p>Of course, scummy advisers exist and are the standard. I'm just suggesting they are not the only kind in existence.<p>Full disclosure: I work in finance in an advisory capacity.<p>[1] <a href=""http://moneyover55.about.com/od/howtoinvest/a/averageinvestor.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moneyover55.about.com/od/howtoinvest/a/averageinvesto...</a>",1325368383

3411911,comment,3411475,3411757,0,0,aeturnum,,,">> I'm pretty optimally situated to take advantage of public transit.<p>I don't doubt that public transit is the worse choice for you, but I wanted to comment on an attitude this line reminds me of. People expect that public transportation will, when it ""works,"" be better than having their own vehicle. If driving to a destination is faster and more pleasant, then the system has failed.<p>In general, there are two problems with this. First, the system was not designed for your trip - your car is. You car will (almost) always be better than any general purpose transport system. The measure of a transport system is how many places you can get to in an acceptable time frame with acceptable reliability. Obviously, as reliability increases and the time frame shrinks, the system improves. Think about the cost of your vehicle (both up front and continuing) and multiply that by the population of your city. We pay quite a lot for the quality afforded by a private vehicle.<p>Second, I think that many people judge trips from a point of view that's heavily conditioned by experiences in private vehicles. I like taking the subway to work because it lets me read for 25-30 minutes. I like it because I don't have to pay attention and can safely think about other things while I'm traveling. Many people aren't used to the different texture of traveling with a crowd of strangers, and I think that effects their assessments of the overall system.",1325366895

But I'm considering it on an international scale, considering good public transit, and city planning. (I've never been to, or read much, about Seattle, so I can't comment on that, and same with Detroit, but both are relatively small cities on an international scale in terms of population, and/or general political/cultural influence)<p>I'm talking about well designed cities. San Diego is awesome, but it's kind of an urban sprawl, not well planned. But any infrastructure would be great in that climate, right? Cool laid back culture in San Diego, but how would the city's deign, aesthetic, beauty, and public infrastructure hold up on an international level? Maybe really well, but it could be so much better. (And don't get me wrong, I love SD, and their beaches)<p>Austin is really cool, but again, is also a classic example of a good city gone wrong with suburbs. Many American developers, and American's just don't understand the purpose of a grid system. In Austin there is 'downtown', but where are the people living there. Downtown in Austin seems to merely represent the 'soul' of the city, while the majority of the 'residents' live in poorly planned suburbs with 1.5 Walmarts, and 3 starbucks for every 5 miles you drive in your SUV. So Austin is not a great city in my book, because of it's poor surrounding suburb infrastructure, and 'fo' downtown. Austin downtown acts more of an amusement park, than an actual great city.<p>But that does not mean Austin is not 'great', it's just not a 'great city' on an international scale, in terms of public infrastructure and the such. But relative to other American cities, it's cool, but it's be strangled by the surrounding suburbs.<p>I live in Atlanta, actual Atlanta, not a suburb. And it's an example of a city infrastructure gone horribly wrong. Little public design going on in Atlanta, which is a shame, because there is so much potential, like many American cities. I think Georgia needs to rethink how we tax, residential tax makes no sense to me. Living in another area from where you work, is a strange concept.

I'll use Germany because I've spent some time there and taken a few trips by train.<p>Two things are required for a regional or national train service to be useful enough that it can be self-sustaining: population density and local public transportation. Local public transportation also requires population density to be effective; someone considering taking a train to Tallahassee FL might decide to drive instead after looking up the bus schedules online. Busses run about once an hour during the hours people normally commute to day jobs and do not go to many useful locations, like the airport.<p>Germany has a population of about 80 million people. Germany is smaller than Montana. The US as a whole has 26 times the land area but less than 4 times the population.<p>There are useful train services in population-dense areas of the US such as the SF bay area and the NYC/northern New Jersey region. The population density of these areas is such that it's often easier to travel by train, subway and bus than by car.<p>The same is not true of Billings, MT, the largest city in a state bigger than Germany. The population of Billings is about 100,000, and the closest city in the state with a population over 10,000 is Bozeman, about 150 miles away. The population of the whole <i>state</i> is about the same as the city I live in, Jacksonville FL, and that city can barely sustain a barely useful bus system.<p>If the US is to have a decent nationwide public transportation system, it needs about a billion more people.

plus, we have many tools and telecommunication technologies which let us communicate and work remotely. Some people have learned that traditional corporate offices are full of things that make them less happy or less productive. Distracting sights, noises, interruptions, makework, politics, inability to say what you really think, having to act and dress artificially, inability to say take a nap when you feel you need it, arbitrary arrival times, hampered ability to switch over to non-employed tasks when needed (family things, a FOSS project, another contract gig, etc). Some find it patronizing as well. There's also the notion of maximizing for happiness rather than purely money. Also a smart actor in any economy will use whatever leverage he has to maximize his own interests. If the demand/supply balance happens to favor sw engineers right now they would be wise to take advantage of it. Businesses and governments do it too. Also, some individuals are broadly talented, beyond just being a programmer, and it's much easier for those folks to exercise and monetize a broader range and depth of their skills if they aren't kept in the narrow straigtjacket of a specific employer's job role, and place and time of business. Being a remote worker makes it much easier to lead a hybrid life where you spend some time on entrepreneurial side projects since less time wasted on commutes and you can handle interrupts from those side projects without political shit from your ""day job"". You can make $100k/year as a FT programmer, a good life to be sure, but the most likely path to making millions is by starting a business. And that path is easier to try if you're a remote worker or contractor.<p>And yes, I know there are positives and advantages to office life as well, please no need to chime in and enlighten me there. been there, have the t-shirt, but there are lots of other t-shirts. :)",1325365983

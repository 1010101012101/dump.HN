56144,comment,55556,55948,0,0,JoeEntrepreneur,,,"Thanks lot ed.
Point very well taken. Same thing happened to me.
There was a company called www.riya.com who hyped lot before launch. They were building some image comparison and search technology.  I saw there demo on demo.com and signed up for beta. I was following their blog everyday and waiting for release. 
When release actually happened, the product was POS (Piece of Sh..)
I never visited riya.com again ever.<p>",1190094623

56135,comment,55556,56117,0,0,JoeEntrepreneur,,,"Thanks greendestiny. You have valid point.
I picked a date November 1st a target for us to make sure we fix all issues and also communicate to interested folks about upcoming launch. 
I feel pretty confident that we can achieve November 1st (unless one of my friend convinces me to push two more features that he has been trying to push)  because now we have only 139 more bugs to fix. ",1190094120
56134,comment,55556,55680,0,0,JoeEntrepreneur,,,"Thanks a lot chmac for all the suggestions. <p>Yes Onista is amalgam of eBay, LendingTree, Priceline and LinkedIn. We are basically trying to close the gap between social network and a marketplace. <p>We picked the date: November 1st.
Will update the website with counter and the launch date<p>BTW, How do I find out who are the biggest bloggers in our area?  I am trying to find on Google, TC, mashable as well.<p>Will start talking on different forums. Starting to search the forums now.<p>Thanks again for taking time and providing suggestions.

56132,comment,55556,55556,0,0,JoeEntrepreneur,,,"Thank you so much everybody for taking time and replying to my questions.<p>To make things clear, yes we are building onista as amalgam of eBay, LendingTree, Priceline and LinkedIn. We are basically trying to close the gap between social network and a marketplace. We are also not as boring as auction or reverse auction. <p>It is a general marketplace and not specific to any niche. <p>The key take away from everybody's reply is<p>1. Pick a date. Sure We are confident that we will launch on November 1st 2007. (139 more bugs to fix)
2. Put a day counter on front page
3. Contact Bloggers that cover social networks and marketplaces and Web 2.0 in general. (Wish I knew where to find these bloggers)
4. Post on <a href=""http://www.buzzshout.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buzzshout.com/</a> & <a href=""http://www.launchfeed.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.launchfeed.com/</a> 
5. Post comments on TechCrunch with a link back to our site 
6. Write a personalized emails
7. Though generating lot of pre-launch hype sounds very attractive idea it may not always work. as ""ed"" mention in the post,  ""I've never, ever ever ever, seen this work out in a positive way. Once the floodgates open, users are almost invariably disappointed by what's available. The result is that you lose the (critical) attention of early adopters"".
8. Use SEO press release from PRWEB.COM for $200. (Any suggestions on services that can help us write a press release? I've never written one and certainly writing is not one of my great skills. Except javascript/css and html)
9. Send a link to the uncov guys. Loved this idea. Would be interesting to read how they will tear us apart.<p>Now I will post specific replies to each post here. ",1190093441

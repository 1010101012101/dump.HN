2621155,comment,2620859,2620991,13,0,alexqgb,,,"It's worth remembering that the expression ""maximize shareholder value"" is composed of three words, each of which represents a highly elastic variable. In combination, this set of terms can be defined (and redefined!) in a manner that will justify virtually anything.<p>Take ""maximize"" - depending on your timeframe, this can mean a range of very different things. And if you cleverly avoid specifying any timeframe at all, you've effectively said nothing whatsoever.<p>Now take ""shareholder,"" which can refer to everyone from mutual funds that may buy and hold for decades to bots on high-frequency trading platforms that measure their holds in nanoseconds. There is virtually nothing that these extremes have in common. Given a hoplessly conflicted set of interests, how does management decide whose benefit they're going to privilege? More to the point, if they DON'T make a clear choice, how can they claim that the generic word has any legally-binding meaning?<p>Same goes for ""value"" - not only can this mean different things to different investors, those meanings can be diametrically opposed. For instance, does ""value"" mean providing a return big enough to outweigh very substantial exposure to risk? Or does ""value"" mean bunker-grade protection from risk, even at the cost of a low return? It's yet another very elastic term that can mean a lot of different things - or nothing at all, if the appropriate frame of reference is withheld.<p>The takeaway is simple: if anyone tells you they're ""maximizing shareholder value"" without carefully defining ALL THREE words, they're probably lying, which is ironic, because they're also implying that they're living up to their fiduciary responsibility. In reality, chances are good that they're doing the opposite.",1307242333

You'd be surprised how often people just don't know what they don't know, or get emotionally attached to something foolhardy.  You get an expert entertainer talking about statecraft or a hard scientist talking about religion or even just a software guy talking about hardware.  It can be gobsmacking.<p>There is a train of thought that tries to classify people into reliable and unreliable -- worth listening to or not.  And I think that's a very bad idea.  No one is perfectly reliable.  No one has a completely rational and educated worldview.  No one.  I think just about everyone is going to have an opinion about something that I think is monstrously, provably, stupidly wrong.<p>I think the best you can do as far as reputation goes is assign it to (person, topic) tuples.<p>But I still think that's a heuristic at best.  Perhaps a necessary one, but I think it's better still to reserve judgement for evaluation of the evidence.  Listen to what someone says.  Listen to the arguments he makes.  Listen to the arguments other people make.  Trust your own experience and reason, and go with what makes sense.<p>What I am saying is that if you ignore people who you think believe stupid things, you'll be ignoring a lot of people who really do know a lot of things worth listening to.  And I think more than that, I'm saying that if you classify information, not by empirical value, but by the tribe of who it comes from, you're evaluating the world more like a cultist than like a scientist.",1307242063

Maybe you'll be able to figure it out better. Many markets get down to two or three big competitorsor five or six. And in some of those markets, nobody makes any money to speak of. But in others, everybody does very well.<p>Over the years, we've tried to figure out why the competition in some markets gets sort of rational from the investor's point of view so that the shareholders do well, and in other markets, there's destructive competition that destroys shareholder wealth.<p>If it's a pure commodity like airline seats, you can understand why no one makes any money. As we sit here, just think of what airlines have given to the worldsafe travel, greater experience, time with your loved ones, you name it. Yet, the net amount of money that's been made by the shareholders of airlines since Kitty Hawk, is now a negative figurea substantial negative figure. Competition was so intense that, once it was unleashed by deregulation, it ravaged shareholder wealth in the airline business.<p>Yet, in other fieldslike cereals, for examplealmost all the big boys make out. If you're some kind of a medium grade cereal maker, you might make 15% on your capital. And if you're really good, you might make 40%. But why are cereals so profitabledespite the fact that it looks to me like they're competing like crazy with promotions, coupons and everything else? I don't fully understand it.<p>Obviously, there's a brand identity factor in cereals that doesn't exist in airlines. That must be the main factor that accounts for it.<p>And maybe the cereal makers by and large have learned to be less crazy about fighting for market sharebecause if you get even one person who's hell-bent on gaining market share.... For example, if I were Kellogg and I decided that I had to have 60% of the market, I think I could take most of the profit out of cereals. I'd ruin Kellogg in the process. But I think I could do it.<p>In some businesses, the participants behave like a demented Kellogg. In other businesses, they don't. Unfortunately, I do not have a perfect model for predicting how that's going to happen.<p>For example, if you look around at bottler markets, you'll find many markets where bottlers of Pepsi and Coke both make a lot of money and many others where they destroy most of the profitability of the two franchises. That must get down to the peculiarities of individual adjustment to market capitalism. I think you'd have to know the people involved to fully understand what was happening.""<p>-Charlie Munger<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/munger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/munger.html</a>",1307241753

Learning a few tricks in each of those areas gives you a thrill, but once that thrill wears off you lose interest and go off to find your next thrill.<p>Grades are just a slightly longer term reward. You work hard for a few weeks or a month then you get rewarded with an A or a B.<p>Instead of beating yourself up over these things you need to find a way to ""reward"" learning something in more depth.<p>Discipline isn't forcing yourself to do something it's more like tricking yourself into doing it until it's second nature and that's what you naturally do. For example, surround yourself with Haskell materials and environments to the exclusion of all else AND have set up some kind of reward system for yourself. Or removing junkfood from your house in order to get hungry. If you're hungry and search the house for a snack and all you have are salads or pre-cooked chicken breasts then odds are you aren't going to go to the trouble to leave the house to find something else, you'll just eat what you have.<p>Basically you need to find a way to make delayed gratification more gratifying to you than instant or short term gratification.<p>Follow the example of Khan Academy.

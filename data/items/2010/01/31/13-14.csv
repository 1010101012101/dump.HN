1090464,comment,1089800,1090370,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Currently this is generally true, though not always. The compiler only has so much information available when it's compiling, the run-time potentially has more information. The most aggressive optimizations of compiled code rely on profiling data gathered from actually running the code. You generate representative usage scenarios, run your program using those usage scenarios (usually automated), gather data about how frequently different code blocks are hit through the use of instrumented binaries, then use that data to produce a highly efficient optimized compiler output.<p>However, not all software engineering groups have the capabilities to produce such highly optimized binaries, and there is always the risk that a user's particular usage patterns will differ enough from the expected patterns that they will lose the benefit of this extensive optimization. However, in an interpreted or byte-code language a lot of the same information needed for optimization is available to the run-time. A run-time designed for optimization may be able to take advantage of that, creating super efficient code paths based on actual usage. This model is more difficult to implement but potentially more robust than statically optimized compilation (and also has the potential to take greater advantage of differences in hardware, a statically compiled native binary doesn't have the ability to morph its optimization based on whether its running on a single core Atom or a 6-way Core i7 cpu, or some 100-core monster of the future, but a run-time potentially can).<p>In the average case most of this is just theory, but the potential is very real.<p>Some worthwhile background reading:<p>Trace Trees: <a href=""http://www.ics.uci.edu/~franz/Site/pubs-pdf/ICS-TR-06-16.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~franz/Site/pubs-pdf/ICS-TR-06-16.pdf</a><p>A blog post / talk from Steve Yegge on dynamic language performance and other topics: \n<a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/05/dynamic-languages-strike-back.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/05/dynamic-languages-st...</a>",1264945564

1090461,comment,1090383,1090383,0,0,ig1,,,"Amazon are being perfectly reasonable, every large retailers operates in a similar fashion. Retailers try to get the lowest prices from their suppliers, and charge the highest price to their customers. It's how the retail industry works. Cutting a relationship with a supplier isn't an uncommon negotiation tactic.<p>You could argue that in this case Amazon are abusing a monopoly, but they're nowhere near a monopoly position. Their income from book sales in North America is only $6 billion (B&N at $5 billion, Borders at $3 billion).<p>Even if Amazon did have a monopoly, Macmillan can still sell their books directly on Amazon via Amazon marketplace at whatever price they choose. I don't think there's any ethical question for Amazon to answer here at all, this is just business.",1264945294

Apple closed down the clone operation because they started cutting into Apple's profit margins.  I think that was then Apple decided that they'd rather have a huge slice of a small pie, than a small slice of a huge pie.  I don't think Apple cares too much about winning any sort of platform war.

1090454,comment,1090361,1090361,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Amazon are going to fight this one ruthlessly because if the publishers win, it destroys the profitability of their business and pushes prices down.<p>Wait. This guy is claiming that publishers are trying to push book prices down, and Amazon is trying to keep them up. This doesn't jive - Amazon has cut the prices of books so incredibly heavily since they came along, and had a very good shopping experience with reviews, excellent customer service, shipping, and so on.<p>I think people are afraid of any company getting too powerful because of the abstract concept - but myself, I'm starting to get comfortable with companies like Google and Amazon taking large share by being the best. If they get corrosive later, they'll have a few year window where they're still on top, but then someone will come and take them out. But I think the current leadership of companies like Amazon and Google is good enough that they won't make shortsighted bonehead decisions against their customers.",1264945013

1090452,comment,1090008,1090074,0,0,cabalamat,,,"> <i>If that perception continues, Apple loses recruiting access to a lot of the best developers.</i><p>I certainly consider Google to be a more ethical company than Apple. Currently, I own neither an iPhone or an Android phone; if I did get one it would be the Android because it is more open. If I did have an Android, it's quite likely I would develop software on it.<p>On the desktop, I currently use a Linux box. I've considered getting a Mac; several of my friends have them. But the locked-down nature of the iPhone and iPad deter me from buying any of their products.<p>So Apple has certainly lost me as a potential customer, due to my perception of them being evil. Do they care? Probably not. However, if lots of programmers think like me, the software ecosystem around their product will suffer.",1264944800

I think this is a slippery slope situation. When Amazon has so much power to throw around, what's the limit of their demands? Today it's pricing, what will it be tomorrow? And the day after? It is rare for any large corporation to avoid abusing any newly acquired power to the utmost extent in seeking advantage for itself. If consumers roll over and don't raise a fuss about Amazon's use of power in this instance, I have little doubt that Amazon will find future uses for its new found power.",1264943587

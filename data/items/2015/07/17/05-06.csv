Functional units AFAIK is only used in terms of &quot;special functional units&quot; which isn&#x27;t relevant for this discussion. One SMX has 6 Warp schedulers, but I&#x27;m not sure on how independant these can operate. My guess is that branch divergence will only NOP out one whole Warp, but I&#x27;m not sure whether the Warps can enter different routines or even kernels (my guess is yes for routines/no for kernels).",1437112775

The activist shareholder is trying to <i>make</i> the future happen; the passive shareholder is trying to <i>predict</i> which future will happen.  The activist shareholder has a lot more information available to him, notably how close he is to winning control of the company.  Some of that information may leak via the stock price and cause a run-up of class C shares, but a passive shareholder faces significantly higher risk when trying to assess the likelihood of activist shareholders winning a proxy battle, because <i>they don&#x27;t know how many shares the latter has</i>.<p>It&#x27;s much like how Porsche cornered the market in Volkswagon shares.  Until the last couple hours, the market at large had no idea how close they were to a corner.<p>Also, remember that the price of a stock is set at the margin, but the value of one&#x27;s holdings is an average.  Imagine that an investor has amassed 100M shares of Google at an average price of $20.  If they get to 100,001K, the value of Google will shoot up to $50.  It is rational for them to pay any price up to $3M for those last 1000 shares, because their profit if they get them all is $3B, but if they are missing even one of them, they get nothing.<p>Same reason eminent domain laws exist: without them, it is rational for a large organization to pay any amount up to the total value of the project to the last few holdouts that are preventing it from being completed.",1437112423

9901374,comment,9899487,9899487,0,0,pron,,,"The question of reduction of the human mind is something many humanists, as well as many STEM people get wrong, but it is quite easy to explain to software developers. The key is this: computation breaks reduction. And by reduction I mean <i>explaining</i> something as the sum of its components, rather than simply describing it as such (although the word <i>explaining</i> requires a definition here which I cannot give). The intractability of simple aggregation of variables makes reduction nigh impossible -- which is why we have physicists, chemists and biologists rather than just physicists -- but computation does so in a much more fundamental way (though it can be said that computation is involved, or emerges, in those aggregations, too). So while an algorithm running on a computer could be <i>described</i> as the physical interactions of electrons in the CPU, explaining and studying the algorithm as a physical process is nearly useless. No computer scientist would reduce a sorting algorithm to physics, and would probably claim that the reduction -- even though it is theoretically possible -- is completely meaningless, as the algorithm transcends the hardware it runs on.<p>The concept of universal computation says that a machine that is able to perform just a few simple operations, can not only simulate the entire universe it is in, but any universe at all -- with any natural laws. The physical world can therefore contain something that is more general than the world itself. Of course, this is not quite so but only an approximation. As the machine needs to be actually built of earthly materials, it does not have enough degrees of freedom to describe the exact universe it resides in, but even as a bounded approximation, reduction is severely limited.<p>Of course, much of the &quot;reductionst&quot; study of the mind indeed operates at the &quot;software&quot; level, the algorithm level -- not the hardware level. But the thing about universal computation is that even that is not enough. A computer software can simulate another computer, and the simulated computer cannot be reduced to the workings of the &quot;virtual machine&quot; it runs in. The number of levels of simulation is, of course, bounded by computing resources, but I think it&#x27;s quite possible that there is at least one simulation layer in the brain.<p>So while reduction is always necessary to understand the foundations of the next level of abstractions, it can never be a full explanation or even a full explanation mechanism. This is doubly so when computation is involved.<p>&quot;Reducing&quot; the mind to neurobiology, therefore, does not change Shakespeare being a better explanation to human behavior than neural networks. The two might well operate at two irreducible levels of abstractions, and even if one gives rise to the other, it does not form a sufficient &quot;explanation&quot; (whatever that means).<p>Dismissing the &quot;reality&quot; or applicability of &quot;literary logic&quot; (e.g. the moon is made of cheese) makes as much sense as dismissing software as less real or less fundamental than the hardware it runs on -- even if the software is simulation a world ruled by laws very different from those governing matter.",1437110568

I thought that only  happened in India. Didn&#x27;t know it was the same story elsewhere. But now, lot of the airport cabbies have decided to join &#x27;the enemy&#x27; rather than try and beat it.

Instead we have to deal with unionism/thuggery, terrible service and exorbitant rates.

Uber really is a life-changer here. This industry needs to be disrupted, and if Uber has to bend/ignore a few rules (which  the existing taxis in India ignore anyway), I think that is a worth-while cost.",1437110467

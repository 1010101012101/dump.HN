They received tons of quality press through out the world, not just on tech-sites. They had over 2 million visitors in the first month... 2 million.<p>The media ate up the Google-killer angle but the product couldn't back up the marketing. If they didn't over sell the product then everyone would look back at how great they launched, but instead if backfired.",1220446794

(eg. google - search, muxtape - make muxtapes)<p>The recommendations spewed by your engine is pretty bad honestly. I don't see how a Michael Jackson fan would want to listen to Cyndi Lauper or Taj Mahal. Try bettering Pandora's recommendation engine. They're the ones to beat.",1220444782

293736,comment,293699,293699,0,0,maxklein,,,"Seriously, WTF! I repeat, WTF! Your 'app' only has one feature, which is music recommendation, right? So it has no other features to make up for it.<p>I go there and type 'Billie Holiday' and the first result that comes back is 'Iron Maiden'. Then comes a bunch of other seemingly random artists like Michael Jackson, Taj Mahal and so on. I don't see Ella, Louis, Anita or any of the people who usually belong to the Billie group.<p>You can't release an application with one feature, and that one feature does not work. This is not reverso world where the opposite of working actually works.<p>This is like a car being released that does not have a roof, and engine or tires. Fix your 'startup' and try again.",1220444180
293735,comment,293712,293712,0,0,mdasen,,,"So, basically, Google is adding more wight to open-source web efforts and that's confounding those that would like to put the web into their proprietary box.<p>A good amount of the commentary over the past couple days has been about what Chrome means for other open-source projects.  It's nice to see an article whose premise (as I saw it) was that Chrome's arrival signals the triumph of the open web rather than competition for current open web products (Safari and Firefox).  Sure, some Firefox users may switch to Chrome, but as long as the browsers are open source and have a commitment to standards (HTML, Javascript, CSS), it works out in favor of the open web and all those who are creating the open web (whether they be website programmers/designers or open-source browser makers).",1220444096

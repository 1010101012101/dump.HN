Some people are so very unreasonable... nor does it massively sound like they know what they're talking about. 5 days appears to be a little too short imo, wouldn't most of these kind of things be measured by the week/month or is this just scare tactics.<p>Can I send a cease and desist that says minus 10 seconds?

Why should it be ""ok"" for him to target Microsoft with it, but not some smaller developer?<p>There's no validity to his claim, this ""news report"" is totally biased. He patented stuff that had been going on since the 80s and then immediately turned to sue the biggest company he could find, hoping to win a payout. The jury sided with the ""little guy"" and the judge threw out the verdict based on their bias. (I think that's what happened, anyway.) I'm assuming he can appeal, but I hope it he doesn't fare any better this time.",1254300791

852091,comment,850359,851428,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>But, there's no way that PHP is nearly 100 times slower</i><p>I too am confused that it's only 100x slower.  Consider the operation ""2 + 2"".  In Java with JIT on, this eventually becomes a single instruction, ""add"".  (Ideally 2 and 2 are already in registers from previous manipulation in the function, and you don't even need a ""load"".)<p>In PHP, this operation is hundreds of instructions.  You start with the AST node.  Then you look up the variable names.  Then you look up their bindings (fast because PHP has no scope, in Real Languages this is at least a linked-list traversal).  Then you finally get the object representing the value.  Now it needs to be coerced into the right type for +.  Once that is done, we can finally run the add operation.  Then the result needs to be boxed.<p>You are surprised that that is 100x slower than a native CPU instruction?",1254300207

852086,comment,851971,852078,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Cool thanks.<p>I totally agree with you. Though I wonder if there is the argument that he is using this patent right... if he <i>did</i> show his specific work to Microsoft and they subsequently implemented it themselves would you not agree he was ripped off by them?<p>Now, if he had this patent and was suing any old company left right and centre I would join you in calling him a moron (he could well take that approach in the future - then he would be a moron). Right now I am seeing a tiny sliver of validity in his claim (if what appears to have happened is true).<p>I'd argue in this case the patent is doing what it is supposed too (though the outcome didn't go quite right).",1254299548

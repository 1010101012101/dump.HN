824857,comment,824620,824620,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Having bigger banks is not necessarily all bad. One of the reasons the Canadian financial system was rocked to a lesser extent than the rest of the world's is because our banking industry is dominated by a handful of big stable players. So their growth strategies recognize that they can't possibly take huge market share away from competitors. Instead, they focus on taking less risky gambles that will provide sustainable growth and minimize the risk of losing existing market share. The American banking sector seems to have a lot more competition but the competition breeds some idiotic pissing matches as each player jockeys for a better position while the opportunity exists.<p>All this said, Canadian banks are notorious for being super conservative due to the lack of competition. During good economic times, this can be bad because they're less willing to say, provide small business loans.<p>EDIT: was looking for marketshare stats and came across this article: <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124268900278332309.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124268900278332309.html</a> The top 5 banks in Canada have 85% of the banking assets.",1253051819

Their investors would likely want a multi-billion dollar equity event out of this, if that were even possible.<p>Facebook has become very deft at public relations in the last few years.  Things like the ""$15B USD Valuation"" spin when Microsoft bought some ads are one example.

He told me to let the partner keep the 5% even if I didn't have to (I didn't and didn't even have to fight about it).

Almost everyone is already dumping fat clients for web clients, even in the enterprise, and it started way before AJAX was even heard of.<p>The advantages of a fat-client client/server app are low latency of the UI, maybe development speed given the right toolset, plus definitely flexibility of the UI for graphics and complicated interactions. Disadvantages though are difficulty of deployment, client platform restrictions, distributing updates/patches.<p>Whereas the traditional web thin client is easy deployment to your users across different platforms, via your single installation on the server. The disadvantage of traditional web clients is that you're restricted in UI complexity and latency is high. But this hasn't stopped so many enterprise and web apps being written (and rewritten) for the web, just to get deployment/update simplicity in place of a fat client.<p>So if you can build a complex UI fat client with low latency and the deployment ease of a web app, you're having your cake and eating it too.

And yet, warts and all, it's certainly worth studying, and utilizing for certain classes of problem.<p>Another example: Tcl has more or less got i18n/unicode/utf8 and threads right for years, whereas Ruby has struggled with those same issues.  Every language/implementation has strengths and weaknesses, and part of what 'marketing' is, is getting the language into the hands of people who will do well with its strengths, and also gathering data from the 'market' in order to determine what needs improving/fixing.<p>BTW, the Tcl community is excellent.

I've heard it referred to by another term, something like ""subverting the structure of the sql statement"" (no, it's not as catchy).  Even just calling it that gives a much more fundamental insight into the problem - it's not about always escaping apostrophes, it's about making sure the query parses in exactly the way you intend.  Looking at the problem that way, you see that 1) there are obviously similar attacks possible against most query languages (LDAP, XPath, whatever) and 2) separating the query structure from the arguments (as tptacek describes) is key to avoiding the problem.",1253049722

I love feeling the paper and wondering about all the people who have read those books, deciphering the little notes on the pages and thinking about who wrote them. They're my little bits of history. Not to mention that rummaging through old used book stores is a great way to spend an afternoon.<p>Even for travel I don't see the worth. I tend to avoid taking expensive things on trips and even then, travel is an opportunity to see what there is to read and learn about the location I arrive at rather than what I can take with me.<p>The Kindle surely has applications, but for me they are severely limited.",1253049715
824787,comment,824553,824719,0,0,makecheck,,,"I think Tcl is ideal for writing domain-specific formats, e.g. file formats that require a few custom constructs but would still benefit from essentially an entire programming language to help with specification.<p>I also think Tk is a major strength, though I always preferred Perl's interface to it.<p>Despite these strengths, I don't like Tcl as a language.  It's not that its syntax isn't without certain charms (brevity being one), but it has a few flaws that I consider fatal:<p>1. It is <i>far too easy</i> to make the mistake of inlining a list.  This can result in arguments being passed in the wrong order, or partial lists being processed when it ""seems like"" the whole list has been read, etc.  This is a very hard problem to debug.<p>2. The Tcl interpreter does not trace blocks very well.  It usually points you to the line of the last curly brace in a half page of nested constructs, which tells you almost nothing about where an error is.<p>3. While it's very easily bound to C, it has no concept of objects.  So Tcl APIs seem to require constant re-querying; for example, rather than ""set x [expensive_get_operation a b c]"" followed by ""[x do_y]"" and ""[x do_z]"", APIs tend to look like ""[expensive_y a b c]"" and ""[expensive_z a b c]"".  All other advantages to objects are, similarly, lost.<p>Of course, Tcl has been evolving fairly rapidly lately, and 8.5 addressed a number of serious annoyances.  Maybe my perception is out of date; if so, please enlighten me.",1253049702

There are plenty willing in the near future to go one-way to Mars.  ""Humans in space"" isn't about science ... robots do that.  It's about pushing the limits of the human experience and spirit.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/opinion/01krauss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/opinion/01krauss.html</a> ... send material and equipment to Mars first, then the first human colonists.

Still they require a GM (and I think rightly so) to guide the game, search for replacements and answer questions.  (And it is still technically PBEM, because the server uses email as the primary interface.)<p>However the typical workload for a GM is far lower than without computer arbitration, of course.  And you can read all the negotiations, if you want to.",1253438846

All looking good.<p>Then I played the demo video - @OwlHuntr...I didn't last more than 12 seconds before I died of boredom. If I need a video lecture, you have to make it something I want to watch, and it shouldn't take more than 30 seconds to give me the info I need.<p>Mercedes can convince me to buy a car with a 30 second TV ad, (not literally, but you get the idea).

The power shifts to the developer, but that would be a good thing for the project. A site for this would be great - developers would never have to take a project again that they don't like again (well that's a goal). One of the logistics involved is geographical dispersion of founders: is that acceptable, and how can it be overcome?",1253438496

832917,comment,832363,832363,0,0,BerislavLopac,,,"Personally I would like to get an US visa, startup or not -- but this is plain ridiculous. As I understand it, the VCs are running out of good projects to invest in in the States, so they want the hill to come to Mohammad, i.e. the founders to get to the US.<p>US is a lovely country I'd very much like to visit, but why don't the VCs simply pack up themselves and go to other countries and fund startups there? I understand that they would find it difficult to follow their investments in foreign environments, but there is a number of solutions they could combine, from having trusted local experts at location, to combining western legal entities with the local technical expertise (Seedcamp's Zemanta, from Slovenia, is a good example).",1253437851

Because , as you might as well face now, you are not going to get anybody really good really excited about the prospect of maintaining an in house Java ERP system. You would have a good chance to get one to work on a new system build in Clojure though.<p>2)How are your managers going to treat people? The old fashioned manager based on the military/factory hierarchy or the new get out of the way so the people can do awesome work while I watch their back politically?<p>3)This is something you might not have thought about, but do you really need this type of person? They are way better technically, but Joe the coder is going to be way easier to satisfy, employ, manage, keep around and replace. You don't need the rangers to take Berlin, you need a lot of expendable barely literate soldiers.<p>Anyway this is just a few things you might want to think about.",1253437213

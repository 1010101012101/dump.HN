I said ""not standard.""<p>Google is a search monopoly in some locales, but what I wrote is more about their <i>acting</i> like a browser monopoly.<p>In a more balanced market, the ""defect"" choice in the Prisoner's Dilemma is to crank out proprietary stuff and leave your fellow prisoners twisting on the reverse-engineering treadmill (update: don't try open-washing me: NaCl being licensed freely is meaningless when Google controls this very complex pile of code that depends on a deep/wide Pepper API into only one browser; Dart may be simpler but open-source != open or ""free""; some vendors such as Opera cannot use any open source).<p>The ""cooperate"" choice is to bring prototypes and proposals to standards bodies and gain buy-in and interop.<p>Yeah, Netscape did a bunch of stuff without standardizing it with w3c or any other body, definitely including JS. We made Microsoft reverse engineer JS as JScript (poor them!). We took JS to ECMA in the second year and only under some pressure from MS and non-sock-puppet web devs. Nothing I can brag about there. That was then, and everyone paid a price.<p>Now, are you suggesting that Google is the better Netscape, the ""good"" monopoly? I don't think so.<p>Again, I'm not moralizing. I'm not the dry drunk lecturing the kids to avoid having the ""fun"" I had. Google will do what it thinks best. My objection is that we have a non-monopoly browser market, not even a duopoly, with pretty good open-standards innovation. Dart goes the other way and puts the open web at risk. It is fragmenting.<p>On JS evolution in Ecma TC39, no one wants design by committee. I spoke about how we strive to avoid that in TC39 at TXJS. Give my blogged video a listen if you can.",1315727272

When I first wrote simplenote.el the Simplenote app and platform were perfect. Since then Simplenote has changed to a direction that I don't like (tags, different pay model) [1]. Furthermore, I have been lately traveling a lot to China and Appspot is blocked there. This limits the usefulness of Simplenote.<p>I do plan to rewrite simplenote.el for Simplenote's API2 and clean up the code but at the moment I don't plan to add any new features.

2983418,comment,2979458,2981595,3,0,cellularmitosis,,,"""The very best way to get better at debugging is to not put bugs there in the first place""<p>Actually, I've come to the opposite conclusion recently.<p>During college, as well as for all of my personal projects, and during the early part of my career, I had the fortune of mostly working on projects for which I was the sole coder from start to finish.<p>As you say, when you're the only variable in the equation, you eliminate the need for strong debugging skills by following a set of best practices which tends to prevent creation of bugs in the first place.<p>And then I inherited my first seriously brain-damaged codebase.  16,000 lines of ""what not to do"".  All of my favorite practices listed in the c2 wiki were completely ignored.  Massive copy-paste coding.  State BOOL's distributed throughout the app making it extremely fragile and tightly coupled.  Thread safety?  What's that?  Hell, they couldn't even avoid giving methods and variables ambiguous names, even in the simplest of cases (""buttonClick"".  wtf?  is that a command (e.g. clickButton) or an event (e.g. buttonClicked)?)<p>I was wholly unprepared for debugging this monstrosity.  My first instinct was to rewrite the whole thing.  In fact, a co-worker of mine had attempted exactly that before I was assigned to this beast, but introduced his own set of show-stopping bugs before being pulled off onto another project, ultimately wasting two weeks of work (his branch was abandoned) and souring the waters for any such attempt on my part.<p>For several months I forced myself to avoid the urge to rewrite, and just slogged through it until I finally started to understand what was going on.<p>I have to say, forcing myself to continue to chew on something sour when every instinct told me to spit it out really improved my ability to follow what was happening in a foreign codebase.  Now, even when bughunting relatively sane codebases, I feel I'm more quickly able to zero in on the problem.",1315726385

There are what, 3, 4, main forums with everything just shoved in there. (and sadly, while I'm at it, I checked. It's still the ancient, very broken attempt at a WYSIWYG editor in channel9. I've wasted more countless minutes trying to make a bug report or question look intelligible with this software both here and in the Azure support forums) Not even close to what I'm talking about. Nor is #win32 appropriate for .NET, VS, Azure, WCF questions, and they're <i>quite</i> happy to remind you of it. I've been there before in times of desperation.<p>I didn't find my reply to be troll bait at all (edit, if parent was referring to my other post on this thread, I'm happy to address my reasoning there, and shall). As I mentioned, I'm not the first to bring up the disparity of community among Microsoft products on HN... and while I misinterpreted the original post I replied to, I think my criticism still makes sense on this topic.<p>Why is it necessary for Microsoft employees to release tools under the Microsoft brand and control? This would be far better suited as an open alternative to Synergy, though that will surely never be the case. (Maybe lay off the kool-aid next summer. This isn't a battle, it's a perception as a developer who comes from an open-tool, open-community centric background who found the stark difference of the Microsoft-stack community to be a bit behind the times. I love c-sharp and .NET, we don't need to be extreme about this.)<p>edit: Further, upon more investigation, Garage doesn't even sound that great. It sounds like these projects are often rolled into MS properties (fine) but are otherwise only allowed to be released ""every once in a while"", only if there is ""a lot of request from employees who want to be able to share it with their friends and families"", according to this very article.",1315724460

I assume that even if Oswald did it, he didn't do it alone. If he didn't do it, is it really a conspiracy that somebody blamed somebody else for their illegal acts?\nthat's just smart murdering.<p>I had to look up new world order, and it sums up everything that is wrong with all conspiracy theories. It's complete propaganda about what the people you distrust are doing to harm you. Don't worry about 'they' are doing. Just be the best you and get on with your life.",1315724425
2983383,comment,2982256,2983266,4,0,BrendanEich,,,"You have me wrong: NaCl is great, perhaps as near to ideal as it can be (it's still nowhere near ""done""; it's experimental where it isn't in DLL hell, libc hell, ""portable"" LLVM bitcode hell, etc.).<p>The quality of the NaCl work is not the problem.<p>The problem is that none of the other browser vendors can or will afford to get on Google's treadmill, trust Google as much as they would have to, then try to implement Pepper (for which the code is the spec, including bug for bug compat), take on all the toolchain dependencies, and hire people to co-maintain on their own release schedules. Not gonna happen.<p>The OS-specific toolchain-and-runtime alternative looks likelier to me. It solves the distribution problem, sinks the costs at the OS vendors, and avoids requiring coordination at the price of the safe plugins still being OS-specific binaries (which we live with today).<p>Another problem I have with your comment is the hope that innovation speeds up when we have more native-code plugin options. I doubt that greatly.<p>Web developers can choose different tools today, but their complexity is mostly confined to the server side and to the development lifecycle there.<p>Moving some or all of this complexity to the browsers via a large and growing menu of ""DLLs"" that are required to be downloaded along with primary app source? No way. Remember, the whole gambit of NaCl requires the humongous and messy Pepper API, the API that is nowhere near standardized or ready (or able) to be standardized, which non-chromium.org browsers are not going to support.<p>It's like the >1000 MS-COM interfaces that ActiveX plugins can and do use in old IE versions.<p>My bet is that the client side will not grow to look like your random Apache installation with (magically memory- and control-flow-safe) multiple programming language DLLs lying about. We may get to a post-JS future but it won't be that Tower of Babel, not on the client -- especially not on the mobile client.",1315724408

I didn&#x27;t appreciate fine mechanical watches until \nI was 40.  With a lot of diligence it is possible(some people) to do your own repair, cleaning  and oiling of their \nown watches.

And even more effectively so: In the past, when your s/o dropped a months worth of pay on jewelry for you, you could still only show it off to people you saw in-person.

Portions of the code can truly be written once, compiled once and bundled into iOS or Android, using portable class libraries. Xamarin can call into native code on either platform, as well as has support for opengl.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think you could write cross platform opengl code unless there was an abstraction.

It is especially likely among people born in the industrial-era 19th century, at a time before the nature of the link between health and sunlight was clearly identified.<p>Around a hundred years ago, the role of UV in preventing rickets was confirmed.  By the 1930&#x27;s, vitamin D supplementation of foods became widespread, and the most obvious manifestations of deficiency (e.g., rickets) essentially disappeared.  Studied intensively since the 1930&#x27;s numerous effects of D (or lack of it) have been reported, and recently interest has exploded.<p>Increasingly evidence implicates low vitamin D levels in a wide range of conditions, such as autoimmune disorders, cancer, and metabolic disease, that are likely contributors to reduction of life expectancy.<p>Seasonality of vitamin D level is well known.  In northern latitudes (>=45th parallel) the nadir occurs around March-April, and the peak is measured on average in September-October.  The timing of these fluctuations appears quite congruent with the article&#x27;s assertions about life expectancy, so it&#x27;s reasonable to think there is a connection.<p>For anyone interested in vitamin D, I highly recommend this excellent review:\n<a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/derm.24494"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/derm.24494</a>",1422246388

He worked at the Westlake campus in DFW at the time.  The entire project he was on was cancelled and all of its staff were cut, and it was just one of many.  Personal metrics didn&#x27;t enter into it, it was just a question of whether you were lucky or unlucky in project assignment at the time.<p>Over those couple of years IBM went from using almost all of the sizable campus it had built to just one small section, renting out the rest.  DFW was otherwise undergoing massive growth at the time though, so the cuts were readily absorbed by Dell, MS, and many others (my father went to AMR).  It wasn&#x27;t like in the early 2000s when virtually everyone in DFW was downsizing or closing and as a fresh college graduate I was competing for entry-level jobs with admins with 10 years at MS.",1422245526

For increments of a stepper motor were required to go from one track to another. This made it possible to write data in quarter track increments, giving rise to one copy protection scheme.<p>A conventional track-by-track disk copy program would not correctly copy data written in a spiral pattern using quarter track increments.<p>There were also schemes whereby tracks were written at a different speed. The logic-state-sequencer state machine for shifting bits from the head would still read the data correctly, but the program could tell a copy made at a conventional speed from the genuine article, due to the different size and content of the gap.<p>Programs that did this sort of thing would tend to have to be cracked by removing all the checks, and replacing their disk loading routines with conventional ones that read ordinary tracks that are copyable with any disk copying utility.",1422245452

Scan the raw access logs via 1 minute cron for the last 10,000 lines - depending on how trafficked your site is<p>2. parse the data by IP, and then by request time<p>3. search for IP's that have not requested a universal and necessary elements like anything in the images or scripts folder, and that made repetitive requests in a short period of time - like 1 second.<p>4. Shell command 'csf -d IP_ADDY scraping' to add to the firewall block list.<p>This process is so effective of identifying bots/spiders that I've had to create a whitelist for search engines and other monitoring services that I want to continue to have access to the site.<p>Most scrapers don't go to the extent of scraping via headless browsers - so, for the most part, I've pretty much thwarted the scraping that was prevalent on my site.",1337345290

They are constantly overwhelmed with work, and will love the help, even if it's only 20% of your time. It will be great for networking, and you'll have a good feeling about it, not to mention something to pad the resume with. Also, you'd be surprised how many places you think are official are nonprofits who could use the free help.<p>Go to meetup groups. Spending money on a conference for networking is not useful when you can get the same thing for free. If you're technical, there are LUGs, programming language groups, database stuff, etc. Consider book clubs of people with similar interests.<p>Start a blog and actively maintain it. Rather than brooding on why the system is keeping you down, study up on things and write articles to teach others. Once you get a flow going, people will start linking to your articles and you'll have some recognition.<p>Just a few starting points. You can easily spend 1 day a week (20% of your time) working on a cool project like that, and still have plenty of time to search for work.

TOPIC: Introducing prime numbers<p>STARTER: Mixed multiplication table questions on board. 
MAIN ACTIVITY: Write the number 92 on the board. Ask students whether '92' appears in any multiplication table. When the answer '2' is received, stress that multiplication tables do not end at 10 or 12, but continue on indefinitely. Repeat for the numbers '999', '186', and '495'. Next, write the number 71 on the board. Students will conclude that it does not appear in any 'tables'. Explain that it does, offering a reward for the first correct answer. With or without hinting, get the answer '1' or '71'. Offering a second reward, get the second of the pair. Explain that every whole number is in the 'one' times table and the 'itself' times table. However, such numbers are called 'prime' if those are the only ones. Ask students to name other prime numbers below 50, discussing suggestions.<p>Complete is_it_prime.doc. Students who finish quickly should attempt is_it_prime_2.doc.<p>That's not meant to be particularly inspiring or anything, just representative.

Freedom is quite abstract, but for me it envelopes economic freedom and freedom to make my own decisions in work. I enjoy my work as a software developer, but I hate the processes around it in a lot of company settings. I feel a company like Valve gives it's employees a lot of freedom and I wish more companies would treat their employees the same way.<p>For the aforementioned reasons I'll be starting a company with a friend in June / July of this year. This friend of mine will work on acquiring the leads (he's proven in the last few years he can get work for me) while my main focus will be on developing the solutions for the clients and guiding our clients through the realization process. With this company we will aim for the following goals:
- earn much more money, I expect I can make around 2000 to 3000 EUR more a month in this setting, though I have to spend some of this money on benefit my employer would normally pay for (holidays, retirement, etc...).
- use my own work processes (I'm not very fond of SCRUM for example - at least not in the way it's executed at my current employer).
- take a leadership / guiding role in some projects, especially since we expect we'll be able to outsource some work within a year or so. We've already worked with an Android developer from eastern Europe recently and this worked out well for us. We can imagine making use of more eastern European mobile developers if we don't have the time ourselves for the projects.
- be more flexible with my working hours. My currently employer wants me in the office from 09:00 - 17:00, while I prefer to work from say 09:00 - 13:00, followed by some relaxation / sports and work again between 18:00 and 00:00.<p>The money will help me gain more economic freedom once I've payed off my mortgage and student loan dept. I don't necessarily need to live in a giant house, but I would like to have a second home in a southern-European country from where I can work in the winter seasons - this is a long term goal I'll strive for.<p>I believe that by constantly visualizing my goals I will get closer to achieving them. I promised myself I will realize the above goals before I reach the age of 40 (currently I'm 30 years old).",1337343693

All of our vehicles are paid for and we have no revolving credit.<p>I am HAPPY.  Poor, yet HAPPY.<p>The secret is that I stopped thinking: ""Why can't I have a car like him?""  Instead, I started thinking, ""It must suck to work as much as he does,"" or ""I'm glad I don't have debt like him!""<p>I have everything I need and quite a few things that I want.  I have money in the bank to buy just about anything I'd like to own, within reason.  I did not achieve financial freedom on what is considered poverty level salary by desiring new fancy things.<p>It took me 4 years of credit counseling and BARELY making it buy each month to realize all of this.  It was not an easy lesson.  But now, I have friends making over $200k that are envious of me.<p>I'm not right or wrong.  My method isn't better than acquiring awesome stuff with tons of money.  I have found that time with my family is more valuable than money.",1337342687

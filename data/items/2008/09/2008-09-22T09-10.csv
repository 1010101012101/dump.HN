Involving VCs could mean problems exiting later down the line. You don't mention if you came through YC - even if this is not the case, the company sounds like a YC startup, and so its worth targetting angel investors who have had successful exits with YC companies in the past.",1222076189

All of those [college] credits should overwhelmingly trump what I can do in a few hours with a pencil and a calculator for something laughable in comparison.</i><p>Generally, the SAT is administered to high-school students, not college students. It's purpose is to predict the performance of those high-school students, if and when they are in college. The point of <i>any</i> test is to improve predictiveness of outcome. The SAT is a type of social test, and its purpose is to predict a certain social outcome -- student performance in college.<p><i>Not to say I did not do well on the last SAT exam I took (on the contrary, because the material is so basic), but why I had to spend the money and waste the time to do so in the first place just stinks.</i><p>The SAT costs less and is faster than testing via college credits. Would you test the inflation-level of tires by driving a car around and measuring its performance (efficiency, road-handling, straight-line traction, smoothness over bumps, road noise, tire-temperature-rise, etc.) because it is cheaper and easier than to ""spend the money and waste the time"" using a tire-pressure meter instead?<p><i>The article is spot on when it says that students are spending time gaming the SAT.</i><p>One way around that might be to give them working-memory and reaction-time/decision-time tests, instead.<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=%22reaction+time%22+jensen+%22g+factor%22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=%22reaction+time%22+jensen+%2...</a><p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=%22working+memory%22+%22g+factor%22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=%22working+memory%22+%22g+fac...</a><p>One of the purest tests of working memory is the Letter-Number Sequencing subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS).

So I went there and the initial frontpage pitch was really nice. So I clicked on my google account. It showed me my different google accounts. Nice.

The internet tends to coalesce around the most widely used method, leading to one site becoming disproportionately larger than all the others.<p>So if we have this ""Sign-in with yahoo"" button, soon everywhere will have 3-4 sign in methods, likely to be Yahoo, Google, Microsoft and maybe Facebook. So we basically hand over everyone on the internet to these 4 gigantic cooporations? What do you think they will use all those user accounts for? Safeguard them?<p>If a mum uses the internet to visit her sewing website, this person should not be forced to hand over their personal information to huge companies, who live off advertising!<p>OpenID is a boon for big companies, and a nightmare for the openness and freedom of the web.

5079610,comment,5078900,5079441,8,0,rmrfrmrf,,,"A few details here:<p>It's not sans-serif vs. serif that makes short texts more legible: it's the x-height of the letterforms that tend to make sans-serifs more legible. Automotive signage typefaces are usually designed with larger-than-normal x-heights, which has the effect of increasing the legibility of a typeface from a distance without increasing the font size (which is why, for example, Arial looks HUGE in Word at 12 pt whereas Times New Roman looks perfectly acceptable).<p>There could certainly be a serif typeface used for shorter texts. A good example would be TheSerif from the FF Thesis collection.<p>Another issue with serif fonts on screens that you touched on: most traditional serif fonts were simply not designed to be viewed on a screen. However, a good counterexample would be Georgia, a serif font designed by Matthew Carter that was made specifically for the screen and used by a large number of websites.<p>One last thing: a reason why serifs are often thought to be more legible in large bodies of text is due to designers being careless about leading. With sans-serif fonts, you generally need to let the leading out a bit in comparison to serif fonts. On the author's site, for example, having the font so big and the leading so small tended to make me lose my position while reading (remember that without serifs to 'anchor' your eye, you're basically limiting your recognizable shapes to lines and circles).",1358528261

Consider, for example, this question:  how efficient is <i>append</i> i.e. for two lists of <i>N</i> elements, how much work will <i>append</i> do?  It is easy to assume this will be linear work in <i>N</i> since <i>append</i> will make a copy; but does CLTL2 actually say that <i>append</i> cannot do work in quadratic time, or cubic time, or even exponential time?<p>It's a valid complaint, in my opinion, and I say this as the person who promotes Lisp as an alternative to C++.  I would put it in the category of ""things missing from the Common Lisp standard,"" lumping it together with undefined behavior.  In practice, this issue rarely comes up; it is generally safe to assume that no Lisp implementation will have an asymptotically <i>worse</i> version of a standard function than the <i>simplest</i> version of that function.  So, for example, although the standard is silent on the matter you can safely assume that no Lisp implementation would have an <i>nconc</i> that is asymptotically worse than the simple linear time implementation, and you should not rely on an implementation giving you something better than that.<p>In the C++ standard, there are definitions of running times.  So, for example, the stable_sort function is guaranteed to be no worse than O(N log(n) log(n)), and no better than O(n log(n)).  That is one thing that is nice about C++, so I can concede that point, though with the note that the C++ standard has its own glaring omissions that are much more disturbing than the running times of algorithms.",1358527816

Most of the risk to them comes from longevity - NOT THE STOCK MARKET.  They hedge inflation, invest largely in gilts and bonds.  And they draw down on the capital.<p>This is mostly fine, because in practice some people live longer, some die young.  The annuity provider can net these off and work to the average.

5079537,comment,5078383,5078961,1,0,slovette,,,"Great view point. I have two thoughts here to add:<p>One, bullying is not a new occurrence. Most of us grew up to be fine and arguably stronger (and there was one year I probably got punched or my head slammed in a locker 4 out of the 5 days in the week). So whats changed today that this generation of children cant seem to grow past it? Its become a devastating ordeal with kids committing suicide and whatnot; thoughts that NEVER went through my head growing up. Shit sucked, but I knew it wasnt permanent.<p>Two, are we coddling our children so much in the new era of child rearing technics that weve stripped them of the notion to grow and learn from the hurtful things in life? Are we teaching them to drop responsibility for the outcome of our environment in a pity me plea? I only ask because when things would happen to me, the first thing my mother would ask is Well, did you do anything to provoke him? and even if I hadnt it forced the notion through my head that I ultimately control my environment by my behavior. Shit happens and I get that, but my mother didnt go to the principals office, talk to the other kids parents or call the police. I simply learned to cope and, well, manipulate. Bluff toughness when necessary; kill with kindness when that was necessary. You learn to change your environment by changing your own behavior and in effect provoking others to change theirs. Probably the most valuable lesson Ive ever learned.<p>One could highlight that the internet has changed the face of bullying. Whereas my generation (y) and the ones preceding me had to grow through physical bullying abuse, and today bullying has changed to public humiliation happening in front of thousands of people thanks to the internet. I could see that being a major factor in the change of effect.<p>I dont believe simply removing bullying from adolescent life is the answer. I think its an easy one to exploit, but I really dont think its the only answer were looking for. Bullies are a part of life and stripping our kids of the experience is only going to leave them helpless as adults. I agree fully that things need to change, but I also have a point of view that most of the time these terrible things that happen to us make us stronger.<p>Its a thought provoking subject really and I curious to see some responses.",1358527416

All you have to go by are public statements/press releases though. All of the private communications between Aaron (and his lawyers) and the prosecution are relevant here. It sounds like, while quoting 'up to' numbers in public, they were telling his defence that they planned to seek 6-7 years at trial (without a plea bargain). Obviously this wasn't something they were bound to (they could change their mind and seek maximum penalties at trial).<p>That said, <i>if</i> they were telling him behind closed doors that they would seek 6-7 years, I don't think we can claim that they were holding the possible 35 year sentence over his head. As others have said in other discussions, if a judge had ignored the prosecutor and thrown the maximum sentence at him, it would almost certainly be overturned on appeal (max. penalties for a first time offender are almost always overturned on appeal).<p>I think one of the biggest factors was that he was facing a possible $1+ million trial with no funds to pay for it.

I've unwittingly been following this advice for a long time. When I save up enough money, I buy a HOUSE. An entire house I'm not just talking down payment. I have 5 houses now. I rent them out. I flip them. I live in them. Did you know you can buy an entire house for less than $5,000? A lot of people don't. I think those that buy houses retail or rent are silly. You think people who try to convince others that giving up coffee works are silly. To each his own. Why buy stocks and bonds when you can buy a house that pays $500/mo rent on a $5000 purchase?<p>Most people think I'm insane when I say that kind of thing, but it happens and it works. It takes experience, research, and time. It takes dedication and will. Strength of character and determination.  Those are the characteristics that are lacking in our population right now and unfortunately those things aren't being taught. Those are the things needed to launch a startup, build wealth, and pay off credit card debt. They are also what is needed to give up coffee at Starbucks, so start with the coffee and you'll build better people for the long run -- that's what's important.<p><pre><code>  > There's no medium ever invented that does this better than television.

Really? These are advanced investment concepts and it takes a lot of education to get there. Start first with not spending more than you make. I think that's the point of the article. Once you manage that, then start thinking about where to invest. You're putting the cart before the horse.<p>All these concepts can and are being learned by people all over the world. It just takes time. You have to crawl before you walk. Crawling out of the hole of debt is the first move.

That misidentification was it appears to acquire documents in an attempt to publish them against the will of the license holders.<p>I'm pro-copyright and patent as I genuinely believe that they are required to ensure proper compensation of authors/inventors. I use CC-BY primarily, which is facilitated by copyright.<p>However, what I'm absolutely against is copyright or patent terms that don't stimulate innovation or artistic creation. Terms should be no more than about 9 years for either.<p>><i>Turns out we want to monetize copying instead, so we are reducing individual freedoms and access rights.</i> //<p>We need fair exchange. Producing copyright works costs just like producing food or goods. Unless you give food, drink, shelter, etc., free to artisans then you can't demand their work to be free. <i>Quid pro quo</i>.<p>I am absolutely sympathetic to the idea of releasing JSTOR data, indeed any and all scientific data, and applaud the apparent sentiment. But I'm not about to overlook the pretty obvious truth in order to promote that position - releasing JSTOR's data to the public would be a highly damaging commercial act. Morally justifiable IMO but certainly against the law. So, was aaronsw guilty, it appears certain from what I've read of the case that he was.<p>><i>but looking onto a property (a physical computer) is not a crime</i> //<p>Fixing an image from a private property is in many jurisdictions (not sure on USA, most likely it's situationally variable).<p>You're creating a false equivalence in any case, having your IP address is looking at your property from afar, logging in to your SSH and taking your files is picking the lock (or swinging the gate open) and walking in and taking something.<p>Which brings us back to authorised. Unauthorised is ""not authorised"", that may seem pedantic truism but it moves towards the next point. Just because my door is wide open doesn't mean you have the right to access my house, you are authorised by active assent not by failure to prevent access. Running sshd with a weak password doesn't mean I'm authorised to access your computer, I'm clearly not authorised, I could perhaps run an exploit on it or brute-force it but that doesn't make me authorised to access it.<p>If you truly hold the position you're espousing then presumably if someone takes money from you you'd consider it ""authorised"" because you failed to prevent them?",1358525807

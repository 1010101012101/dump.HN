Specifically, even if it takes six seconds to render a single frame of a demo, when the program updates its timer to make the next frame, kkapture will tell it that only (say) 1/30 of a second has passed. That way, if you encode each rendered frame to a video, it plays back at a smooth 30 fps even though it took much longer than 1/30 of a second to render each frame.",1304909927

Get back to people quickly, though sometimes if you don't know what to say, waiting a little while so you can gather your thoughts has its merits.  It can sound flaky to send a prompt email reply with no real content and then follow-up later with a more substantive reply -- or worse send a brief email promising more substance and never deliver.

Especially in the US where the carriers have a such strong hold on the only viable channels to consumers you basically can't get anywhere unless you can align your interests strongly with the established parties.  Apple forced their way in through sheer mass consumer appeal, Google managed to do it through a brilliant strategy of giving carriers just enough control to make them see it as a savior from being dictated to by Apple.   But what strategic value will carriers get from offering WebOS based phones?   If HP screws them with bad hardware they are stuck.   If HP screws them with bad software they are stuck.   Pile on top of that the fact that the demands of modern smart phones these days go way beyond a nice OS - you just can't compete unless you come to the table with a huge range of services integrated - mapping, search, voice-to-text, etc.  WebOS relies on competitors to get these services which can't possibly work long term.<p>I also disagree with the assessment of WP7 - I don't think the so-called ""missteps"" have even been noticed by the vast majority of consumers using WP7 phones.  With Nokia maxing out their distribution channel to push WP7 phones I really can't see how WebOS is going to beat them.

2527270,comment,2526532,2526991,4,0,tzs,,,"From what I've seen ""covenant"" is the most common term used for this kind of thing. For example, here's a page I put together once to help me understand the differences between the various patent promises that might affect ODF and OOXML, although half the links to the originals no longer work. It shows two Microsoft documents, a Sun documents, and the terms IBM uses for many standards side by side, with the text colored so that sections in the difference ones that correspond in function are colored the same. It makes it easy to look at one and see how the others word their similar section:<p><a href=""http://www.tzs.net/odfooxmlpatent.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tzs.net/odfooxmlpatent.html</a><p>In essence, a ""covenant"" not to sue is a fancy way of saying ""promise"" not to sue.<p>As far as the difference between a covenant/promise and a license goes, the courts have been unclear in their guidance. Covenants/promises may not survive a sale of the patent--although the cases are mixed. Covenants/promises may not provide the person they are given to the right to sell things that use the patent to third parties (or rather, it may not apply to the third parties and so the patent owner might be able to sue them). The case law here is murky, too, with the latest tending to favor that the covenant/promise does apply downstream.<p>I've seen cites to at least one appeals court case where the court said all patent licenses are really just promises not to sue. That's because a patent does not give the patent owner permission to practice the patent. It just gives him the power to exclude others from doing so, and so he can't really license you the right to actually make something that is covered by that patent. All he can do is agree not to sue you if you do so.<p>Most of the cases, though, apply to covenants/promises to a specific party. E.g., company X and company Y are disagreeing over X's patent, and as part of some settlement X grants Y a promise not to sue.<p>Different considerations might apply when the covenant/promise/license is not to anyone specific but is rather a non-exclusive covenant/promise/license to everyone. When viewed as a license, this kind of license is something called a ""bare license"". Bare licenses are not good for the recipient, as they can be revoked at any time. What you really want is for the covenant/promise/grant to be viewed as a contract. Fortunately, there is a mechanism in contract law to allow this, called promissory estoppel. The basic idea is that if I make a promise to you (where you can be the whole world), reasonably knowing that you are going to rely on this promise, and you do rely on this promise and act accordingly, then the law will enforce the promise.",1304906682

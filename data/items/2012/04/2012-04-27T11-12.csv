Water excess weight is the excess weight you shop in your body temporarily the moment you drink water, eat salty foods, fruits, sugar and other forms of food. It does not necessarily add up to your current body excess weight as you lose the water excess weight when you pee, sweat, or when you do your day-to-day business in the bathroom.<p>2. When you cut down your calorie intake whenever you go on a low-carb diet, you lose excess weight quickly but do not be misguided as you are losing the water weight, and not the specific weight. Likewise by going towards the sauna  you just lose the water weight, which you gain it all back the moment you drink fluids.<p>3. As easy since it may be to lose the water weight, some water receives absorbed by your body tissue and cling to it, which affects your all round body weight.<p>4. Too much intake of processed foods which are substantial in sodium makes it hard for the body to flush down the sodium, which makes your body become thirsty enough to want to maintain on towards the water. This does not necessarily become lasting excess weight since it is still considered water excess weight but it will make you appear bloated. To lose the water retained by sodium in your body, merely decrease your consumption of foods substantial in sodium. Salt is okay if not needed by your body, but there must be balanced.<p>5. By hydrating yourself and consuming enough water everyday, you inform your body that it will have enough water supply continually and forces it to lose the water stored in your hands, feet, and other areas in your body that make you appear bloated.",1335527387

I have paying customers on my server and I want to put the website in maintenance mode to prevent data loss. ""Sometime between 7am and 11am"" is NOT an acceptable answer. The downtime itself is a matter of 5 minutes, but I would expect an accurate time to shorten the maintenance period.<p>- They announced a server downtime for ""Tuesday night"" once. So what is ""Tuesday night""? Is it the night from Monday to Tuesday or Tuesday to Wednesday? Guess what, I put my website in maintenance mode in the wrong night.

(Matters when you are adding json based web 2.0 integration to your router.  For small cases jshon is 15x faster and uses 1/14th the ram.)  And I would really want to avoid using jsonpipe inside of a loop.<p>It also seems to handle typical use cases inelegantly.  Probably the most common thing I use Jshon for is turning json into a tab deliminated text file.  To compare both, here is a query that returns json search results:<p><pre><code>    curl -s ""https://aur.archlinux.org/rpc.php?type=search&arg=python""
</code></pre>
If I want to get the name, version, votes and description into a single tab deliminated output with jshon:<p><pre><code>    jshon -e results -a -e Name -u -p -e Version -u -p -e NumVotes -u -p -e Description -u | \
    sed 's/^$/-/' |  paste -s -d ""\t\t\t\n""
</code></pre>
With jsonpipe it looks like:<p><pre><code>    jsonpipe | grep -e '^results/[0-9]*/(Name|Version|NumVotes|Description)\t' > matches.tmp
    grep 'Name\t' matches.tmp | cut -f 2 > name.tmp
    grep 'Version\t' matches.tmp | cut -f 2 > version.tmp
    grep 'NumVotes\t' matches.tmp | cut -f 2 > vote.tmp
    grep 'Description\t' matches.tmp | cut -f 2 > desc.tmp
    sed -i 's/^$/-/' *.tmp
    paste -d '\t\t\t\n' name.tmp version.tmp vote.tmp desc.tmp
    rm {name,version,vote,desc}.tmp
</code></pre>
Most of that awkwardness is from `paste` really wanting real files to operate on.  But if you are going to use jsonpipe, you might as well just write the whole thing in Python.<p>The one thing that I do like about jsonpipe is that each line has the fully self contained path.  So you can shuffle (or otherwise destroy) the output but still have something with usable context.  Except for the example above, where the order matters a lot.  For really simple cases jsonpipe's method is nice.  I might just port it to C so that there can be a fair comparison.",1335526728

    20 goto 10
</code></pre>
in this scheme becomes<p><pre><code>    label start
    print ""name""
    goto start
</code></pre>
so why not<p><pre><code>    loop 
    print name
    restart loop
</code></pre>
and then later the label <i>loop</i> could become <i>loop while</i> or <i>loop until</i> or <i>loop with item from list</i>. ""restart"" makes sense both at the end of a loop and if you wish to continue with the next iteration after a test. Using goto to break out of a loop could be <i>exit loop</i> or <i>continue after loop</i>.<p>I'm not sure what other uses of ""goto"" you'd expect at this level beyond restarting or exiting loops.

Maybe it's not totally relevant here, but I'm interested in what effect the switch has on ratings.<p>I think conceptually they are different. +/-, yes/no, thumbs up/down work best ""would you recommend this?"", just like ""liking"" or ""+1""ing, or up-voting links on HN and reddit.<p>Star-ratings are still best for when you critique a more extensive piece of work, and may be accompanied with a review. ""This book is good and I recommend it, but I think xyz is better and it lacks from these reasons, so it gets 3.5 stars.""<p>Both are relevant and different ways of designing user-feedback, and certainly too often companies have mistakenly used 5-star rating when a binary recommendation is more appropriate.<p>Probably the best example is bulletin board/forum systems. They all seem to come with 5-star ratings for threads, but conceptually it makes no sense. You don't critique a conversation as ""well this conversation is interesting, but not as good as this conversation, so i rate it 4 stars out of 5. OP: Next time i would recommend writing things more in this style for a certain 5-star thread next time!""<p>Here conceptually, you either recommend a thread (""check it out!"") or vote it down (""this isn't worth your time clicking on""), a la links at reddit and answers on SO.<p>Most youtube videos are the same, as the vast majority are single-concept videos, be it music videos, comedy, sketches or otherwise, often just 2-3 minutes in length. Either you recommend it or you don't.<p>But multi-star ratings still makes sense in contexts where your review is multi-faceted. A hotel may be good for some reasons, bad for others. Longer experiences (say a vacation, extended experience with a business), and long-form media books, feature-length documentaries etc, are still appropriate for a star system.",1335526066

Works with software rendering so no acceleration needed.<p>I've been quite satisifed with terrain generation - I've calculated noise value (a few octaves of 2d Perlin noise) for every tile on screen, tiles with noise values over bias were solid, others were empty. I hadn't checked if there's always way out, but after tuning amplitudes and frequencies of noise generator I've never had problems with that in game.<p>Then I've had look up table that returned tile depending on which neighborns are solid and which are not. To cut the number of tiles I needed to draw I've used hex-like layout - every second row of rectangular tiles were shifted half an tile to the right. Thanks to that every tile had only 6 neighbourns, instead of 8. So I've needed 128 instead of 512 tiles. And it made levels look more ""organic"", than with regular 2d grid.",1335525571

I'm commenting on the GP's post, which implies some people aren't capable of answering questions this quickly because they have a different mental processing style.<p>The reality is they need to realise they're approaching people with little free time who have to quickly sort the wheat from the chaff, and asking basic, targeted business model questions like these are a fair way of doing so.<p>These types of questions aren't meant to make any sort of statement about the person's worth;  they are there to determine  (a) if the person, at this point in time, is <i>investable</i> as an <i>entrepreneur</i> at the most basic level, i.e. do they understand the basics of business, and have they done their homework with respect to their business; and (b) whether the results of that homework suggest a <i>business</i> potentially worth investing in.<p>A person with positive scores on both these accounts would be able to easily answer these questions in the time allocated.  For the remainder, either they don't have a viable business model (fail at (b)), or they aren't familiar with business (fail at (a)), and that's why the site is valuable -- it gives the latter experience validating their business model before the pitch, which may otherwise cost them a missed investment opportunity.<p>(That being said I didn't like some questions:  ""Tell us something surprising you have done"" or ""What's the funniest thing that has happened to you.""  Have a few beers with me and <i>all</i> kinds of stories will come out, but I don't have a reverse lookup for my experiences -- my mind goes blank when I'm asked questions like these!  That being said, it's good to be aware they might be asked, and to at least prepare in some way to respond.)",1335525484

By placing a buy order at $10.20, the price will start trending upwards. So, if no-one comes along to trade in the next two minutes, the price will reach $10.05and the order will fulfill since there are sellers at $10.05. This will clear the buys and the ""pressure"" on the price will return in to between the bid/ask spread.<p>On the other hand, if a seller comes along after a minute and places an ask at $9.90, the trade will complete at $10.04, and both traders benefit.<p>I'm not sure what the implications are but I'm not sure if you understood the time-varying, averaged price concept btilly was proposing.<p>In the CAT example, I would expect the price to have trended to between the Bid/Ask spread from the last trade price (say it's $22.00) So that's where the order can execute if buyer and seller arrive at the same time.<p>Again, I have no idea if this is good idea and the mechanics seem over complicated, but thought it was worth pointing out what might be a good idea.",1335524971

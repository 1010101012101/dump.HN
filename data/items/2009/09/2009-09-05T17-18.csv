By making sure she can't get valuable experience?  Also, just because you don't understand why someone would offer an unpaid internship instead of a minimum wage job doesn't mean it's a bad idea.  Should your ignorance be the basis of public policy?  I don't mean to come across as rude but come on,  I'm a grown adult and don't need or want your ""protection"".",1252170305

Make it a collaborative community, and give some fricking minimal thought to quality control by means of a voting system, and your problem is solved.<p>It's 2009.  Why is the owner of the Mavericks not aware of this sort of thing?  Answer: he wants full ownership control of the resulting content.  But he doesn't want to pay for it - that would make him less of a billionaire.  So actual volunteer work is out.  He wants the benefits of ownership without the disadvantage of paying people.<p>The government is right, here.  Unpaid work for somebody who fully owns the results and benefits from it directly is a scam.  It's <i>spec work</i> for God's sake, and I certainly see plenty of people coming out of the woodwork decrying that every time it comes up.  Yet here, everybody's piling on the government for trying to prevent a billionaire from taking advantage of a bunch of out-of-work creative staff.<p>(If people want ""valuable experience"", there's no shortage of volunteer work that won't involve a billionaire laughing all the way to the bank.)",1252170199

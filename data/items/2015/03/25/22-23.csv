9266633,comment,9265205,9265205,0,0,programd,,,"Never use closures. If it&#x27;s worth writing a function at all, it&#x27;s worth naming it and putting it outside of the current function. It is code you can&#x27;t reuse without copy/paste since it&#x27;s just embedded in another function like that. There&#x27;s also a cognitive load in switching from reading the flow of the enclosing function into some other anonymous function. Cognitive load leads to errors - viz the submission. IMHO closures are a toxic infection. I blame Javascript.",1427324384

If you can succeed with computers you can succeed with other things.<p>Response 1: This would be better stated as &quot;Be well rounded&quot;. The article goes on to say some gibberish about understanding the size of the universe which is only related in the idea of &quot;big&quot; being more than &quot;narrow&quot;.<p>Point 2: Learn to learn. Be well rounded. If you don&#x27;t understand something, figure it out.<p>Response 2: As opposed to what? Accepting solutions? This is a very hackerish mentality. It can teach you many things... counterpoint is that sometimes you should just accept good advice or answers and not reinvent the wheel.<p>Point 3: Don&#x27;t bother with formal education.<p>Response 3: Formal education helps a lot of people. Not me personally, but many people&#x27;s learning style requires them to have help. Not all hackers are crazy self taught maniacs.<p>Point 4: Build your own computer<p>Response 4: There is nothing much to building your own PC these days. IMO you really aren&#x27;t going to learn much from it any more than assembling some legos. A better idea would be to build your own 3d printer; that will teach you a lot more and give you better hands on skills.<p>Point 5: Run your own Web, DNS, and email servers.<p>Response 5: I&#x27;ve written my own DNS server from scratch. It was interesting sure. I&#x27;ve dealt with the low level packaging of emails; it is a pita. I think coding exercises are better advice than this, especially dealing with logic puzzles. It is much more fun, and you will get more out of exercising your brain that way. Web, DNS, and email servers are boring as shit.<p>Point 6: Read science papers<p>Response 6: This should just say &quot;Read books that interest you and make you thing&quot;.

Otherwise I&#x27;m not understanding what one will get out of this.<p>Point 11: Use Vim or Emacs, not an IDE<p>Response 11: I&#x27;ve met a lot of &quot;hackers newb morons&quot; who suggest this. I know how to use Vim, and also use Vimdiff when needed. IDEs don&#x27;t hide anything. Prolific use of jEdit, IntelliJ, Eclipse, Visual Studio, etc are very helpful and will teach you more than using Vim. This is stupid advice imo.<p>Point 12: Use Linux or Unix as your main OS<p>Response 12: Who actually uses branded Unix as their OS. This is silly. Say &quot;Use Linux.&quot; Additionally, throwing out OSX as bad here is ignorant.<p>Point 13: Dale Carnegie.<p>Response 13: Fuck that.

I don&#x27;t think Dart ever had a chance to compete with JavaScript on the browser, especially as JS is advancing so rapidly with ES6/ES7. I&#x27;m a strong believer in what the future holds for JS.<p>But Dart is something else. Dart showed us what JavaScript would have been if it were designed this decade, and with some thought to its architecture. It&#x27;s clinical in its cleanliness (have a peek at its standard library and you&#x27;ll agree). It was pitched as a full stack language for web applications done right, and I certainly felt it lived up to that claim.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m more interested in Dart as a replacement for Node.js. Luckily that dream is still alive: &quot;We continue our strong investment in Dart VM for server, embedded, and mobile.&quot;",1427324079

My assessment of Atlassian&#x27;s approach to Bitbucket is based on me observing them handling tickets for it (stonewalling for years), and other users&#x27; observations on the difference in the way they handled BB vs Stash.  The silence from Atlassian on some years-old Bitbucket tickets is deafening...<p>Let me just drop this here: <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/8436/not-all-github-repositories-shown-for"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/8436/not-all-github-...</a> shows that Atlassian can&#x27;t even be bothered to make it easy for people to migrate to Bitbucket, their repo import tool cannot handle the pagination the github.com API does.  They can&#x27;t be bothered to let people paying to Github pay <i>them</i> instead.  My guess is: they don&#x27;t care about your $5 (or whatever puny amount it is) payment for private Bitbucket repos, they care more about the $XX,000 they get from every Stash license sold.  And mentions on Bitbucket tickets make it look like Stash is quite popular in some corporate circles.<p>NB: GHE <i>may</i> be superior in every way, but does it integrate with JIRA as well as Stash does?

I suspect that they had to buy new modems on their end, but my modem was only about $100 so I can&#x27;t imagine that theirs was more than $100 especially if they&#x27;re buying millions of them.<p>They haven&#x27;t upgraded the coax that runs to my house, or the pulls that run along the telephone poles.  Those are all the same.  So it&#x27;s an equipment upgrade?  $100 once so that they can charge $20/mo more forever?

Fiber transceiver keep getting faster and cheaper every year.  As slower ones break you can replace them with faster ones for less money.

So that means that Comcast can do the last mile for $100 or less of new investment and the last 25 miles for $4 (2000 people per pair, $8k per pair) of incremental investment.  This is not a lot of money relative to the $60/mo that I pay.<p>>  Is it valid to look at this as paying for that, and if CDNs can&#x27;t pay, then end user prices will have to go up?<p>So first I disagree that the CDN should have to pay anything, again since I&#x27;m paying Comcast to connect me to the CDN!!<p>But even if I admit your point (which again, I emphatically DO NOT!) the amount of money to make an upgrade happen is TRIVIAL relative to yearly revenues.  $104 in one-time hardware versus $720 in yearly, recurring revenue.",1427323732

How many of the items are personal information someone has entered into Facebook (status updates, photos, etc), and how many are published articles that someone has shared? In most feeds it is a healthy mix. A quick survey of my own showed about a 2:1 ratio in favor of published content.<p>Shared articles are an inherent part of the value of Facebook today, which means Facebook has no leverage. They can&#x27;t hurt publishers without also hurting themselves.<p>Ask yourself this: if Facebook has all the power, why are they bothering to offer to host published content on their servers? Why not stick with the status quo, where the publishers do all the work and Facebook just serves ads?<p>In fact, Facebook is creating this new service to help Facebook. Because, like publishers, Facebook also faces growing competition for attention. A world in which publishers self-host their own content is a world in which Facebook is just a middleman...and middlemen are easily replaced on the Internet. Readers can share links on Snapchat just as easily as they can on Facebook.<p>Content is still king. People want interesting things to read.

So you can keep the laptop on battery forever, swapping them out and charging them.\n - More connectivity options than anything else: VGA, HDMI, separate mic/headphones, SD card, 2xUSB3, and physical wireless on/off switch\n - Physical touchpad buttons\n - Ample-size trackpad, and the keyboard buttons are advertised as a decent 2mm of travel distance (deeper than most small laptops nowadays)\n - Optical disc (blu-ray) drive.  In that tiny form factor with exceptional battery, pen-included yoga-tablet, lighter-than-macbook-air durability-tested machine.  Amazing!",1427321427

Might only be 3% a year.<p>What I was trying to say is with that level of funding versus the amount of features that they have to deliver (little/no interfaces, no database, no scaling, no sharding, no data sanitization, etc) it&#x27;s much, much easier to get things right.  This is basically firmware and the hardware is known so it&#x27;s much, much easier to get it right.<p>The web is so often broken because there are dozens of different standards by different institutions that are adhered to in varying degrees by many thousands of different projects running on a multitude of hardware.

It&#x27;s fair to say that we subsequently improved Scribble in academic-friendly paper- and book-writing directions, but like so much of what the current Racket developers do, it was motivated by programmer experience rather than academic tasks or credit. The current developers can only work so fast, but I hope Racket continues to attract more contributors who build more tools.<p>On the topic of parentheses and submodules: I can understand why some consider parentheses to be an obstacle, but I&#x27;m puzzled that you&#x27;ve singled out their use for submodules. Syntactic forms in `#lang racket` use parentheses, and I think they&#x27;ve worked well in practice for submodules. That said, submodules are most powerful when you don&#x27;t use them directly and instead use (or create) constructs that are implemented as submodules.

When I bought it I wasn&#x27;t sure if choosing it or Macbook Air, choose the Zenbook for its better resolution. Same thing is happening now.",1427320838

Same with CoffeeScript (which makes a similar claim). So these claims are totally reliant on parameters that haven&#x27;t been defined, ie. what constitutes &quot;equivalent&quot; handwritten code?",1427320830

It&#x27;s also probably worth mentioning that this is an example of symbiosis in the borad sense. It&#x27;s not a mutualistic relationship where both the fungus and the orchid benefit. The parasitic plant is using the fungus essential as a straw to suck sugars and nutrients from the roots of other plants. The fungus does not appear to gain in any way from the relationship.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcodes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcodes</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalanthera_austiniae"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalanthera_austiniae</a>",1427320818

It all depends on how capable Windows is on a 800 MHz machine with 1080p as compared to the new MacBook&#x27;s 1.1 GHz - 1.3 Ghz CPU. Also how will battery life be affected when upgrading the Asus to a 1.2GHz and higher res screen.",1427320807

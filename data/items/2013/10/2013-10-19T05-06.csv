Many people are using Git to manage the dot files, but how to deploy them is still a question.

When I lived in Orlando, Florida my productivity just hit rock bottom. I didn&#x27;t want to do anything. Neither did anyone around me. My neighbors were all lazy, everyone was lazy, the parks had a lot less people than parks up north. Every thing was just slower. Less people walked. Everyone was just inside. The sun is just intense since Florida&#x27;s closer to the equator, the heat is extreme during the summer and since there&#x27;s so much humidity your body can&#x27;t cool itself off through sweat evaporation. Also, when you&#x27;re in the heat your body sends more blood to circulate in your skin and uses a lot more energy to keep itself cool. And even simple things like going outside to check my mail would just be a burning pain. I&#x27;m serious, we all stayed indoors. We were like prisoners. Miami is even worse. And Key West was just... a boiling oven.<p>Compare the productivity levels, development, & innovation of colder countries with warmer countries. Is it really a surprise that so many 3rd world countries are hot countries near the equator (with very little availability of air conditioning)?<p>&quot;According to this theory, about 70% of the economic development of a country can be predicted from the distance between that country and the equator.

6575464,comment,6574005,6574980,4,0,pandaman,,,"This has to do with the way the software interacts with hardware on PC.<p>Basically, a GPU is a very complex computer with several hierarchies of execution streams e.g. there are vector SIMD streams that execute same code over different data, there are threads of such streams that preempt each other, there multiple processing units each running a set of such threads, and there are even structures of such processing units. Yet all of this is hidden from the programmer and only API there is an abstract &quot;scene&quot; description. E.g. you can say &quot;first render these polygons with such and such settings, then render other polygons with other settings, then show what is rendered so far and return to the default state&quot;.<p>Going from such a high level description to the thousands of execution streams that GPU will execute is a very complex procedure that changes with each driver version and is not fully understood by any single person. On top of this you have other processes running on your machine while playing the game and they can and will steal CPU and the OS scheduling slots, adding a lot of variance to your frame time.<p>You can render the same data set several times and sometime it will take 10ms but other times it will take 100ms depending on what other processes decided to do at the time so it&#x27;s impossible to guarantee constant frame time on PC.<p>On consoles it&#x27;s not a big deal as you can program the GPU directly and don&#x27;t compete with other processes.

Not too many LED displays around (though the principle is still similar).<p>While there&#x27;s no scanning electron beam the electronics on these displays are still optimized for scanning.  That is they push a whole bunch of adjacent pixels in every clock cycle.  If you try to use those for random access your refresh rate is going to fall dramatically.  The problem isn&#x27;t whether or not each pixel can be switched independently it&#x27;s how to efficiently address them and move data from the display controller to the display.<p>(editing with some more info)<p>If you changed the monitor&#x27;s protocol to push X, Y, pixel and souped up the on-board electronics your pixel rate would probably fall by an order of magnitude.  So your 80Hz display is now an 8Hz display (for full frames).  In terms of how each pixel behaves they are independent (each has it&#x27;s own transistor and capacitor) but the addressing is on a grid.

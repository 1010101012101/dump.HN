Well, I'm happy to have spurred further thought, but I think you might have misunderstood my point of view.<p>There are only 2 reasons I wrote this article:<p>1) The original chart is horrible. It's embarrassing that it was published by reputable sources due to it's awkward and very skewed presentation of data. The fact that figures weren't adjusted for inflation is not a  ""small, irrelevant detail"" but rather a fundamental requirement when graphing monetary value over time.<p>Regarding the stacked vs. line chart: The stacked chart is ""complicated"" because although the formats are broken down, it's actually very hard to get a read on any individual format's numbers over time. A line chart is a more simple (less sexy) way of showing the total over time AND the individual formats over time.<p>2) I'm kind of fed up with the ""sky is falling"" sad face the RIAA puts on and the overblown news stories dramatizing this fall. Come on, first digital revenues in 2004? There's a very clear business reason the sky is falling. It's simply embarrassing that after avoiding/fighting digital distribution for years and years, the RIAA tries to rewrite history, explaining their losses on lions, tigers, bears and pirates.<p>So, again, to be clear, the goal of the post was not to prove or disprove anything, but to correct and clarify.<p>Regarding my relationship to this story: I have many dimes invested. I am a musician and run a small business selling digital music by subscription (which <i>encourages</i> sharing) and which was profitable from the day of launch.",1298156015
2240155,comment,2239836,2240043,0,0,Duff,,,"The problem is that we're pretty bad at predicting the long-term implications of discouraging consumption.<p>Examples:<p>Tobacco. State revenues in particularly are dependent on tobacco taxes, which were enacted under the theory that since smoking is bad for you, reducing consumption would lower heath care costs. Unfortunately, the end result is a regressive tax that gets more regressive over time as consumption drops -- without the corresponding reduction in health related costs.<p>Real Estate. Since World War 2, we have been encouraging the development of new building of all kinds. We heavily subsidize personal mortgages, slums, and commercial/retail, both directly via cash incentives and indirectly via massive public works.<p>Environment. We discourage activity that damages the environment, but often single out marginal activities with minimal impact. For example, New York now fines construction workers $500 each for burning scrap wood in a burn barrel for warmth, to protect society from air pollution. But it's ok to drive 70 miles to work every day.",1298155990

2240144,comment,2239288,2239981,0,0,rwl,,,"This argument doesn't work.  Promoting ""freedom,"" with respect to software or anything else, is <i>always</i> about promoting some specific freedoms at the expense of others.  Copyleft licenses make a different set of tradeoffs than BSD-style licenses, it's true.  But that doesn't mean that BSD-style licenses are ""objectively"" more free.  They simply promote certain freedoms of programmers who are one step downstream from the source, at the expense of the freedoms of users who are further downstream.  The GPL protects a particular set of freedoms for everyone downstream, at the expense of certain freedoms for those once-removed programmers.<p>The mere fact of an inherent trade-off in freedoms doesn't mean that the actions of the FSF, or programmers who use the GPL, are ""about propagating your view of how things should be"" and not ""about freedom.""  That's just as ridiculous as saying that, in authoring the US Bill of Rights (say), the authors were not making decisions ""about freedom"" because they chose to promote certain freedoms of private citizens at the expense of certain freedoms of agents of the state.<p>It's a difficult social task to figure out which freedoms are the best to promote, and which can be traded off.  But making the hard choices in these trade-offs isn't just a matter of promoting freedoms that one ""likes better.""  Some freedoms <i>are</i> more important than others, insofar as they better promote our various social values and purposes.  Whether or not you agree with the FSF's vision of what those values and purposes are and which freedoms best achieve them, it doesn't make any sense to write them off as merely working for some other agenda.",1298155587

On the internet, if people repost on blogs they are propagating it themselves.<p>> Propaganda is about propagation of a meme, but where does it start? And how do you distinguish fact from fiction when the self-identified news networks intermingle news with opinions masquerading as facts?\nI dunno. That's a good one. Now I know since I am one of the smartest .000000000001% of people in the United States (because I read Hacker News and engage in thoughtful discussions like this) I have the ability to identify the rational arguments made by independent sources when held up against the drivel from mass media. But you make a good point as the average american would probably be too stupid to make such discernments. They couldn't reason their way out of a box.<p>In all seriousness, if you pound a rational argument equally as hard as an irrational one, the rational one I believe will always have the advantage. That's how you distinguish fact from fiction and it's predicated on the fact that the average person is intelligent enough to be rational. Yea people will head for the light that shines the brightest but they'll still try to head towards the one that looks less like a train heading towards them.",1298155517

2240133,comment,2239288,2239861,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"You do lose the ability to make money off of software licenses when you include a stipulation that every recipient is free to redistribute your software's source as far and as much as possible at a price not exceeding the cost of the reproduction and distribution of the code, and that he is free to resell binaries of said software at any price. As we see with RHEL, if you try to do so, something like CentOS will come in and spoil the party.<p>There are times when this kind of sharing is good, but I believe if we were interested less in economic zealotry and more interested in individual freedom to control the software that runs on one's computer, we'd see a lot more people distributing source code. That would ultimately produce a net increase in freedom for computer users, even if the rules say you can only share modifications with people that have a rightful license.<p>Those that want to license under a copyleft are by all means free to do so, but we shouldn't exclude people that would be willing to distribute source code so that their users can control the program themselves, but who are not willing to switch to a support or subscription based business model. You can't make much significant money selling GPL'd software, you only make money by selling support contracts to BigCo. And that model is not applicable to everyone, even if it works out OK for database systems and Linux distributions.<p>Whether it's simple to copy or not, it's not simple to implement or design, and implementers and designers should be compensated even if their work can be reproduced at minimal cost after its initial production and release.

Spartan designs that focus on diving in and easing the call to action as much as possible.  Big fonts, soft gradients.  These are the tools of the 'pre-fab' layout.<p>When you're starting out, I firmly believe that you should ship first, and more importantly, that you only have, at best, a 'good idea' of how users are going to interact with your application.<p>As you get more users and get more feedback, then your UI/UX needs to evolve to meet with common use cases, or to cover use cases you hadn't thought of, or to keep up with demand.  I strongly believe that you can't predict this going in, unless you have already built a very similar product for a very similar demographic, or unless you already have existing users.<p>You're 100% right in that the pre-fab design ideals don't leave much room for branding, but there definitely IS room for branding.  Of the sites using these common design patterns, there are definitely ones that stick out moreso than others, due to superior branding.

There is no risk.</i><p>I used to work for a web design shop. My fellow programmers and I hated the fact that our bosses were making money on our backs. They would bill clients these huge fees for our hours and pay us 10% of that amount. What did we do about it? We complained to each other during lunch hours. Until one day when I threw in the idea, ""lets start our own company"". Then the truth came out, all those brave soldiers started backpedaling. I was in awe. I quit my job soon after, became a freelancer and 3 years later partnered up with another programmer to start a development company. We went through ups and downs at the beginning, not garnering much support, even from our own social circles. It's been a year and only now are some of our clients finally realizing the appeal of our offer. We have more work than we can handle and have had to moved into a larger office in a downtown area. I'm literally starting to hire next week. The same people we tried to get help from at the beginning, who were instead doing nothing but discourage us, are now more than willing volunteers.<p>I've had many similar experiences all throughout my life. I have once tried to organize a class action lawsuit against a company orchestrating an organized scam. I knew many of the clients personally. So I tried to gather them and the same thing happened, there was fud and people chose to wait and see what would happen as they left me to handle the initial steps on my own. I eventually reached an agreement with the company and got somewhat compensated. Later on when people heard, they tried to join in on the action, but by then it was too late, I had moved on with my life.<p>Another example, about 2 years ago, I had dealings with an agency that wanted to build this really ambitious website for one of their clients. I was hired as a developer along with other professionals from various fields (design, ux, marketing, etc). The agency ended up not paying any of us and while everybody were emailing each other trying to figure out what to do? I threw in a couple of bold ideas, such as bypassing the agency and dealing directly with the client, suing the agency. As expected the brave mouths didn't feel so tough anymore. I ended up hiring my own lawyer and a few months ago, I obtained a court decision. When people heard, I started receiving emails about ""maybe ganging up to get our money"".<p>All 3 stories have the same pattern. There is a problem, a risky proposal gets thrown in, people react to the idea, someone does something about it. I've come to the conclusion that being an entrepreneur is a character trait. You either have it or you don't.<p>Soon after I quit my job 4 years ago, I read or heard something somewhere, I don't remember the source, but it basically said, you get paid what you deserve. It's only now that I have a small and growing enterprise and that I have to explore the compensation question that I understand this. My coworkers from 4 years ago still work for the same boss. Maybe they got salary bumps, maybe they didn't, maybe they're still complaining during lunch, but one thing is sure we all got what we deserved.",1298153620

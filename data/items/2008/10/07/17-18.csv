325875,comment,325572,325744,0,0,nuclear_eclipse,,,"C# (and the possiblity of IronPython/Ruby/etc) is a <i>much</i> better language than Java, with many things that make it both nicer and more flexible/powerful to work with.  I also must admit that I much prefer the .Net library, and the ability of C# and friends to take advantage of operator-overloading (something you can't do in Java) to actually use helpful syntax elements (such as bracket read/write to dictionaries, etc.).<p>Besides, I still feel like a 2nd class citizen with Java anyways...  I use as few Microsoft products in my daily work/school life as I possibly can, but after using C#/Xna to make a few games in my classes, I was extremely impressed by C# and .Net.  It's just too bad Microsoft is so draconian about everything, or else I wouldn't mind having C# as one of my primary languages right next to Python, PHP, and C/Lua...",1223401962

325871,comment,325572,325762,0,0,krschultz,,,"I agree with you that Sun will forever be held back by their past actions. Must the same way KDE is still not <i>quite</i> as accepted because of the Qt licensing scuffle - what 10 years ago? However when you look at the success of big complex projects - Eclipse coming to mind first - on Java, there is no equivalent on .NET that really works on every platform.<p>I too think there will be another language that succeeds C++ in FOSS, and I thought it would be Python, but not so sure now. C will always live on in a lot of the more important stuff like the kernel and basic utilities, but desktop apps will eventually move on. That is a discussion for something else, but I don't believe it will be Java or Mono. I'm just saying that Java is a better system if your primary goal is cross platform. If your primary goal is to build great Linux apps - then it is not.",1223401733
325870,comment,325674,325832,0,0,sethg,,,"If a recession becomes severe enough, there is the risk of <i>de</i>flation--nobody wants to buy anything, so vendors keep slashing prices to try to unload their inventory and workers are willing to take lower wages to avoid unemployment.  To counteract that cycle, dumping lots of money into the economy (as long as it's not <i>too</i> much) is just what Dr. Keynes ordered.<p>I've also heard the argument that since businesses spent the last few years acting <i>as if</i> the weird bonds in their portfolios were as good as cash, then if the Treasury replaces those bonds with actual cash, it won't have a net inflationary effect.  (Although I fear that Wall Street is going to take its bailout money and use the proceeds to create a silly bubble in some <i>other</i> asset; localized inflation, so to speak.)",1223401705

325867,comment,325775,325775,0,0,randomwalker,,,"I enjoyed the East vs. West discussion in the article. I grew up in the ""East"" (India), and even by those standards, the importance of ""making a desperate all-out effort as if your own life were at stake"" was drilled into my head from a pretty early age. It's one of the things I've chosen to keep, even as I've discarded most things the East gave me, like religion.<p>When I moved to America, I realized that this notion sounded or would sound pretty absurd to most people around me. Inevitably, I was drawn to entrepreneurship, because that's where I found like minded people.",1223401628

325863,comment,325572,325751,0,0,krschultz,,,"Over the summer Microsoft was the one providing the technology for nbcolympics.com (Silverlight). Prominately on the Silverlight website it features the words ""cross-platform"" and ""cross-device"". But go to the featured use of it - nbcolympics.com - and it would not play on Linux, or even Windows 2000 or Windows ME. Only Windows XP, Vista, and one version of OS X were supported.<p>Or nbcolympics could have gone with Adobe Flash and everyone could have watched it on any platform. Sure I could install Moonlight (the Mono project's version of Silverlight) but it didn't WORK for Linux.  To me if Mono and Silverlight took over the web we'd go to a stage where everyone thought it was cross-platform because Microsoft says so and there are these projects, but people using Linux get a terrible experience. Users don't care why that is, they just know it would suck, and Microsoft would hobble Linux for another few years. The Mono project is enabling that, and that is why a lot of people who are FOSS contributors don't like them. Myself included.",1223401483
325862,comment,325692,325742,0,0,siculars,,,"i couldn't agree with you more. competition will sort all this ugliness out in the medium to long term. today's web applications are so complex with so many moving pieces that bounding performance to any reasonable range is becoming more and more difficult.<p>i'm pretty sure amazons dynamo paper has been mentioned here on more than one occasion although it does not speak to javascript performance specifically. what it does do is attack the problem of bounded performance in their space, but may be abstracted in general. the paper talks at length about specific issues in their problem space but takes an overarching approach to isolating performance bottlenecks and ensuring performance at a finally granulated level.<p>i think the way that the dynamo paper attacks the larger problem by breaking it down into its constituent parts and then ensuring bounds on those subsections has value in this discussion and beyond. no doubt a great way to ensure overall performance is to strongly decouple constituent parts and ensure tight performance bounds on those parts which you have greatest control. in total, you will be able to predict with more confidence a performance range that you may feel comfortable with.",1223401433

325837,comment,325598,325641,0,0,thorax,,,"<i>> The whole point of traveling is that you see something new.</i><p>This is all probably great advice when you're talking about being a tourist.<p>As someone who does business traveling a lot, though, it's really hard to argue some of these points.<p>I, personally, would rather carry a little extra junk through an airport because I decided to include a backup shirt and slacks in case I spill some soup.<p>When we're talking about business travel, you're talking about things that affect your career or your own company. I take what I need to be 99% sure I'll be successful at the destination-- and I don't worry so much about the burden. Of course often you can go out and get what you need, but you don't want to have to do that (especially at the last minute) if you don't have to. That extra bit of confidence of feeling <i>prepared</i> can make all the difference to let your mind focus on getting business done to the best of your ability.<p>All this aside, I think the analogy about software is a great suggestion. You really don't know what you <i>should</i> be taking with you (i.e. features) until you get there (i.e. release it to users).<p>I liken that to a civil engineer building a bridge remotely and then delivering all the pieces without having ever visited the site himself. He or she would have a much worse idea of the dimensions, concerns, or obstacles-- and might have to re-engineer a lot of what they built.<p>Of course software is more flexible than that, but it's still a great idea to take a few, and not <i>all</i>, of your ""best guess"" features to the customer until you get their usage/feedback to build on.",1223398972

Both of them seem right on target to me.<p>Reminds me of an essay by Stephanie Tolan titled ""Is It a Cheetah?"", which offers cheetahs as an analogy for gifted children who are confined to (and as a result, crippled by) public school systems.<p>Excerpt:  
""The cheetah needs to run!  Despite design and need however, certain conditions are necessary if it is to attain its famous 70 mph top speed. ... It must have plenty of room to run. Besides that, it is best motivated to run all out when it is hungry and there are antelope to chase.  If a cheetah is confined to a 10 X 12 foot cage, though it may pace or fling itself against the bars in restless frustration, it won't run 70 mph.""<p>Full article:

However, if the matching title is a proper noun, it requires exact case match.  This is a side-effect of relying heavily on case for matching in order to prevent accidental or overzealous matches.

143807,comment,143780,143780,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"I remember hearing Tom Merritt complaining about this on BOL a couple days ago... Apple's been using its updater to sneak in installs for a while; by default, updating a standalone install of Quicktime will automatically install iTunes on your system.  While I'm sure that they're not the first to engage in this practice, it is definitely shady, especially for a piece of software like a browser.  In the Quicktime / iTunes scenario, you can at least treat it as a program that simply does more than you need it to do, in the same way that nobody ever really used Realplayer as their default media player.  But there is absolutely no functionality to be gained here; Safari is not going to allow them to do anything that they previously weren't able to do.",1206247583

143804,comment,143148,143709,0,0,vlad,,,"PG doesn't say starting anything new will be easy or that everybody should do it under all circumstances.  He tries to focus on the truth.  Even people who are fully happy working in corporate should be aware of what the truth is.<p>If a fat lady had an honest blog about healthy food and exercise, then that is great advice to be aware of.  Some may think the information is tainted because of the source, but if you can logically deduce it is accurate, then the source doesn't matter.  In fact, some may think a fat person should talk about cupcakes.  However, the truth is that doing, and talking about, such things an athlete might, is exactly what the fat person should be doing.  And no, that's not because they're already fat and need to lose weight--it's because that's the truth and everybody should be thinking about it, regardless of what shape they're in.<p>Same thing here.  Paul is not 22 years old, but he focuses on writing what he believes is truth logically derived from his experiences and those of others around him.  Therefore it doesn't matter if a reader is happy working corporate, a janitor, young, old, or lives outside the US.  If it's truth, smart people will want to be aware of it, even if they never plan on starting a startup, exercising, or eating healthy.<p>I could write a blog with the same exact content, and it wouldn't get such publicity.  But it wouldn't make what I say less true.",1206247327

It's hard to believe that any person (particularly a programmer) would set a reply-to address to a real domain other than their own. I understand not wanting bounced emails, but c'mon guys.

With no real barrier to entry, the amount of participating people may become overwhelming, thus making it difficult and/or impossible to achieve the ""intimacy"" aspect.<p>In addition, both of these aspects would increase the possibility that the participants would not necessarily be the type of highly motivated, independent people (who would have found their way into the startup camp regardless of any barrier to entry, no matter how challenging) who are predisposed to succeed in a startup environment.<p>mS",1206246968

143792,comment,143735,143770,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Yeah, but it's not really an equal comparison.  You can start a startup with a bachelor's degree (or less...) and a couple years of work experience.  You need about 6 years of grad school, 2-3 years of postdoccing, and 6 years as a tenure-track professor to become a tenured professor.  Assuming you aren't weeded out at any one of those stages.  Your chances of getting tenure at the end of this are quite a bit lower than the chance that your startup will succeed, given equal intelligence and effort.<p>A better comparison would be startup founder <=> grad student, cashed-out entrepreneur <=> tenured professor.  Startup founders tend to have more freedom than grad students, and multimillionaires tend to have more freedom than tenured professors.",1206246658
143791,comment,143265,143371,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I personally can't stand Paul Krugman. I know he's done good work in academia, but his op-eds push a liberal agenda regardless of the evidence in favor of it.<p>In this case, how would the federal regulators know how to price risk better than the owners of financial businesses? Krugman doesn't say. He posits that they have some magic knowledge by virtue of being government agents.<p>The truth is, there was a unprecedented bubble in real estate values and real estate related debt. No one knew how to price them correctly. For a regulator to attempt to do so would be like a regulator setting the right price for Yahoo in 1999.<p>Neither does Krugman mention past failed financial regulation. Canada had only a handful of bank failures in the 1930's, compared with thousands in the US. The reason was that banks in the United States were kept small by anti-branch banking laws designed to keep any one bank from having too much power. The larger banks of Canada survived, not so the banks of the US.<p>What assurance do we have that the current regulators will get it right? Many people in public life seem to be drawing bad lessons from the current crisis so far. I'm inclined to think that they won't get it right.",1206246650

143785,comment,143735,143735,0,0,te_platt,,,"I am very surprised at the discussion this essay has touched off.  I thought it was almost obvious what pg was saying.  I have been from start up to large company to starting my own start up to working for a large company again.  I've lived the same changes two times over now and can completely relate to the caged lion feeling.  It's not that I'm a better programmer (or person for that matter) when I'm working for myself.  It's that working for a large company has certain restrictions on freedom that come with the added security and comfort.<p>In short, I feel, act, and behave differently based on my environment.  There are a lot of nice things about working for a large company and I work for a good one right now.  Still, if I didn't have my own projects to work on (another start up coming on!) I would go stir crazy.  I thought the analogy to a lion was quite flattering.",1206245871

He gets a lot of threats from lawyers, but it looks like no big deal, as all the suits he gets are identical.  He probably knows the rules better than the lawyers that threaten him.  He could have made billions by extorting incompetent companies in a formal manner, say, settling out of court for a breach of security, or something.

In that paradigm, not everyone has to start from scratch.  You can grab someone else's code and add functionality to it.<p>My pet project of the moment is to develop an ""Industry wide SOA"" with a defined interface between the services.

It sounded like PG can, at a glance, see programmers who seem ""smart enough"" but lack fundamental qualities that YC founders possess.

Any kind of timing or nonverbal sound has to be expressed somehow in ASCII. Most emoticons are thin symbolic standins for actual face-eye contact, but some emoticons and larger images posted on forums and the like express things you couldn't possibly express verbally.<p>Now, you may say, hey great, so the next great leap in human relationships is fucking LOLcats. Well, people walk around saying Git 'R Dun to each other in the flesh. In my opinion LOLcats is at least a step up from that. Besides, that's just retarded superpopular images.<p>Putting aside the base communication, what about file transfers? If I'm chatting with someone, it's trivial to hand over, in a sense, some image or mp3 or document or whatever.

I found it very interesting and quite convincing, but beware that it&#x27;s long (1.5 hrs) and you have to be willing to sit through a lot of biochemistry, since he goes through a bunch of cellular metabolic pathways in gory detail. If you don&#x27;t care about the biochemistry, the parts about how everything we &quot;know&quot; about nutrition is based on shaky ground (e.g., the FDA&#x27;s food pyramid, &quot;fat in the diet is bad&quot;, etc.) is well worth watching, as is the history of how the amount of sugar in the U.S. diet has been dramatically increasing (e.g., the steady increase in the serving size of Coca Cola since 1915).",1373945780

I&#x27;d say that for many, many cases, all errors should lead to the same result in the application, but with an error-specific informative message.  Even if you want to have special handling for errors such as 4xx that might mean something is permanently wrong, getting a 500 is the same as experiencing a network error (except in a client side app where the latter might mean you&#x27;re not connected to the Internet and should try again, but then you should use yet another API to determine when to connect), and getting a 200 with the wrong content-type has an excellent chance of meaning the same thing as a network error, in the form of a captive portal.  To this extent, APIs with many separate error paths that encourage the user to write their own nonstandard error messages are harmful, because they will probably do worse explaining things than with a common method of triage.<p>Of course there are other cases where the difference matters.  It just... doesn&#x27;t seem very &quot;natural and idiomatic&quot; to me, that&#x27;s all.",1373945727

They have a wonderful story, and are a top notch non-profit (they give 100% of donations to the cause...even going so far as to reimburse credit card fees).<p>One challenge they face is finding ways to scale. The vast majority of donations come in through the web, but those are from supporters they create in offline events. We wanted to find a way to grow their base of supporters, by telling their story simply and elegantly (that&#x27;s the plan at least). Put more simply, we wanted to &quot;make charity go viral&quot;. They have raised over $95M in the past 5 years, but they are trying to tackle a $1B problem here, so we did our best to scale their efforts. We normally work on for-profit ventures (www.monkeyinferno.com), so this was a unique challenge.<p>Attempt #1 took a year, and ultimately failed. (too complicated, viral coefficient = 0.7)<p><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/08/michael-birchs-waterforward-is-kind-of-a-chain-letter-pyramid-scheme-for-charity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/08/michael-birchs-waterforward...</a><p>Attempt #2 is the product you see now at waterforward.org<p>30+ iterations in 30 days, trying to make this slide-show story concept work. We just went viral overseas (4M shares so far), but unfortunately haven&#x27;t raised a ton of money. Biggest problem is that we are super viral in India, but can&#x27;t process Indian Rupees.<p>Anyway - thanks for the constructive feedback. We&#x27;ll work out some of the UX issues over time, but for now, we appreciate the general support.<p>-Shaan

Personally, I don&#x27;t see what would be gained by combining them all together in a library, except confusion.  A lot of libraries do get this wrong and make it difficult to disentangle what is going on.<p>If you feel like golang needs one method to do all the above, feel free to write one and post it to the mailing list... I doubt that it does, but feel free.",1373943791

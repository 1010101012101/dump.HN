I'm not one of those people, for the reasons above.",1232609741

He could have been talking about the future of scripting languages, or the future of statically-typed languages, or anything.  However, one thing is clear: The future of languages is definitely VMs.  There's just too many advantages to them.  I'm hard-pressed to think of a significant language in the past fifteen years that isn't VM based.<p>Once that's taken as a given, why reinvent the wheel?  It seems like there's numerous advantages to using established VMs like the JVM or the CLR.  In order to justify the engineering effort of building and maintaining a new VM, you'd have to have a compelling reason and I'm not sure that the reason is always there.",1232609680

I used to walk to the library, post office, bank, & 2 supermarkets in Bedford, which is the least walkable of the three.  Lexington & Concord have downtown areas that are just as walkable as Mountain View or Palo Alto.<p>The food sucks in suburban Massachusetts though.  There're like no decent restaurants in any of those town centers, and you've got a point about them being dull.  Some decent places in Cambridge, but then you're back to being too urban.<p>The one thing I really like about the Boston suburbs is the abundance of greenery.   A lot of houses are built on an acre or more, with buffer forests because the streets never run straight in Massachusetts.  AFAICT these just don't exist in Silicon Valley until you get out to the foothills, and those communities don't really have downtown areas at all.",1232608731

I'm not looking forward to a parade of Executive Order text submissions from Obama fans who can squint and find a hacker angle in anything.<p>On the face of it, there is one major change under the new order: a former president can no longer unilaterally request withholding of their records (until possibly reversed by a court order). Now, the Archivist acting with the approval of the current President can ignore a former President's wishes.<p>Whether that's really a dramatic shift in practice, we'll see. (There may not be a single record actually released by this change, if Obama and his Archivist agree with former Presidents on any requests.) An article actually arguing this is a dramatic pro-hacker shift would be welcome. In the meantime, the raw Order text with a spun headline is a bad precedent.<p>I fully expect tenuous submissions of this type will fade with time. But the sooner they are replaced with analytical takes -- even if on the same subjects -- the better.<p><i>Editted with correction: removed ""for the 12-year period"" and reference to only Bush-43 and Clinton-42 as being affected.

Both the Justice and the Vice President get it right. In the clip of the Presidential oath, the Chief Justice attempts to speak the full first phrase, but is interrupted in the middle by the President.<p>The President is the one who starts the deviation.

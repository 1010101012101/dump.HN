The NDK isn't officially supported on those GTV platforms but it isn't difficult to get it working in practice.<p>Also, any complaints for this would probably be directed at Google (though I guess Google and Moto will be the same company soon anyway) because arch filtering is generally handled by the Android Market, so for users with these devices they just won't see the games showing up at all on their local install of the Android Market (since the market will be filtering out anything NDK based that doesn't have an included x86 build), so it looks like a market issue (if they already know the game exists), not an app issue.",1326319183

First the nit misses the spirit of the example which is simply to demonstrate that ""double"" has higher precision than the fixnum ""long"" type; second, calling it a bug misses the fact that text explicitly does <i>not</i> say you can use it to count arbitrary strings; as the text says, it depends.<p>3.

It took us quite a while because we were not technical founders.<p>I think we got lucky because an open source option became available with just enough documentation for me to tweak it with the skills I learned by reading books at the library and from links on Hacker News (we're publishing a travel magazine in the Apple App Store and we used Baker and Laker, two great open source frameworks.

From a personal point of view, as an ideas guy who never really thinks about execution, it was very difficult. I enjoy spending my time thinking up ideas that will change the world and getting frustrated when I realize I don't have the skills to implement them.<p>Working on our magazine was a change for me. It wasn't a grand idea, its not going to change the world. People might love the stories, but its not the ""next big thing."" And I have to say, I'm ok with that. If fact, more than ok, its very satisfying to actually get something done, to have it in my hands and be able to say its mine, rather than just one of my ideas floating in space.<p>It still took a lot of work, especially on the motivational side, but I handled that by intentionally breaking it down to the smallest task I could.

That means that if we are at some stable steady state going outside the system and doing something like opening up your data to everyone versus trying to publish in a brand name journal will be a disadvantage to you since the number of publications in these types of journals are they way that you are judged.  The issue isn't about whether the journals charge for content or not.  Journal subscriptions are cheap compared to  labor and reagents and, as always with third-party payer systems, the incentives aren't really aligned to skimp on them.  The real question are there better ways of giving people credit for their work in a way that enhances their career in a proportional way to their achievement? Are alternative systems better for rewarding the right people faster, and thus moving research faster? The answer may be yes, but there is a significant energy of activation barrier to making any kind of switch from the publishing-as-a-measure-of-achievement model.",1326315916

I believe my site is built in a fairly SEO friendly manner, with keywords taken into account in copy, titles for pages, etc.  I've been reading about SEO for a while and i've done pretty well with a few sites but I'm sure folks who spend their days doing SEO will still be better at it than me.<p>Back links are the main issue because I don't have many (any) and i'm not sure where to get them for this particular site.

In a normal landing the rotor downwash would spread out across the ground but in this case the walls channeled the moving air back up and into the rotor again, causing it to lose lift.
Of course I don't know whether that's true or not, but it seems plausible.

Borrow other people's phones, Skype, or use public phones if you need to make or receive a call. Never communicate with anyone whose inbound calls may be monitored. Use one time pad encryption where possible. Otherwise, fall back to public/private key.<p>Finance: Cash is king. Use prepaid disposable credit cards or stolen credit cards if you need to make a credit card transaction. If you have access, use an informal exchange system such as the much famed Islamic system. To move money internationally, buy and sell expensive items such as art or jewellery that you can carry on your person as you travel.<p>Travel: Boats still seem a very good option for international movement across oceans. If no ocean is involved, catch public transport that does not require leaving your identity and movements on databases (eg: unreserved trains, buses). Stolen vehicles are preferable to registered ones, obviously.<p>Other: You can also assume other people's identities by stealing their identity papers/other documents. It seems these days this is getting much harder as 'identity theft' countermeasures are put in place.",1304561644

If you talk to the CIO, you may gain a friend in the CIO but you are guaranteed to gain an enemy in the team lead.<p>If I were your CIO and you came to me with good ideas, the first thing I would have done would be to run them by the team lead. Since the team lead would not be on board with those ideas, I'd think that either: a) your ideas weren't good; or b) you aren't good at execution of those ideas because you don't work well with your leads. Politics suck but they are a part of life.<p>- Work with the team lead so that you both meet with the CIO to discuss your ideas. Use the meeting to present yourself to the CIO as more visionary/strategic in understanding the potential of the ideas.

""with which Chrome did this"" -- to me -- inferred that he was referring to the development group when he said ""Chrome"" (and also was referring to the process with which they executed said upgrade). This would imply transparency in the 'apparent or not hidden' sense being applied to the Chrome development group and/or the process that they were using.<p>Just sayin'.

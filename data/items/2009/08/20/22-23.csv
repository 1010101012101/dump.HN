776571,comment,776221,776536,0,0,frossie,,,"<i>My preferences change over time. How can a good recommendation algorithm account for that?</i><p>I'm confused. You just re-rate the discrepancies - I do that routinely (some movies seem okay after you watch them, then a few days later you realise they were eminently forgettable). The Netflix UI makes this easy by showing you the movies you recently rated for a while afterwards. I'd be pretty surprised if the recommendation algorithm didn't have a time weighting in it too, counting the movies you have rated recently more than the ones you have rated in the distant past.<p>You also seem to think that multiple profiles is a workaround - well to me, it's a really good solution to that kind of problem. When Netflix announced they were going to pull the feature I was one of the many people who complained, and was very happy when they reversed themselves.<p><i>""Remember that this guy is a writer not an engineer. His solution is likely bad! [..] The problem statement is still there""</i><p>But is it? I don't have any personal evidence that it is, and dude says it is but he doesn't rate movies so how can I know? Is it for you? Do you find that Netflix recommends movies you would have liked 5 years ago but no longer do so because your tastes have changed? If so then yes, we have a problem.<p>I <i>do</i> have a problem with the Netflix recommendation algorithm in that I don't feel it deals well enough with klunkers - just because I enjoyed 5 Hugh Jackman movies does not mean I will enjoy Van Hesling, because Van Helsing was a really bad movie and would not have been a good movie even with the second coming of James Dean.

776507,comment,776111,776402,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"To my understanding, a major reason that Erlang was written was because they needed a concurrent system <i>with soft real-time guarantees</i> - in order to work for telephony, it had to operate within predictable, bounded amounts of time.<p>Conventional Prolog wasn't an option* , because the backtracking inherent in its execution model leads to significant variance for worst-case timing for individual operations. The same problem can happen with lazy evaluation, for both time and space - while the sophisticated compiler optimizations can allow for some really remarkable <i>amortized</i> performance, individual worst-case measurements can still have some serious outliers.<p>* Though Erlang was prototyped in SICStus Prolog.<p>With lazy evaluation, forcing a thunk for a seemingly minor operation can trigger a burst of postponed work. This can be a problem if it means a sudden drop in a game's framerate, for example, much like non-incremental garbage collectors' pauses have made people wary of using GC. Similarly, a JITting compiler can do more elaborate optimizations if it can afford to stall the program perceptibly while performing them, but that would disqualify the compiler for many real-world uses.<p>Real-time operation can impact performance, much like implementing full transactions slows down databases. Still, it's a fairly significant feature in its own right, and a language that does concurrency faster overall, <i>but cannot prevent occasional erratic timing</i>, is aiming for a different target than those (e.g. Erlang) that have such guarantees. It's not unusual for a program that juggles tens of thousands of connections to need to respond to them promptly, for example. Concurrency isn't just about performance.<p>(Also, that's why the Erlang movie has that ""Declarative real-time programming NOW!"" banner in the background. :) )",1250807640

A sand mandala is not just symbolic--it's ceremonial, it's expected, and nobody gets hurt when it's destroyed. _why's disappearance was not ceremonial, was not expected, and did hurt people. It reflects the notion of impermanence, but that that is neither the totality of Buddhism nor an idea exclusive to Buddhism. Absent the notion of karma (or some other check), impermanence implies Nihilism, and it's a gross distortion of Buddhism to suggest that any suffering you cause for others in the name of impermanence is ok as long as you grow individually.<p>Zed is doing what so many are unwilling to, which is to point out that even though we all love _why and can all agree that he had the right to do what was good for him, it's <i>still</i> a dick move to hurt people in the process, and he could have handled it better. _why could have accomplished the same thing without hurting anybody. <i>That</i> might have rightly been called a Buddhist act, and fit for praise.

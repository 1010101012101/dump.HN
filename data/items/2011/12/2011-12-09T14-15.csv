...This is very different from iOSs original design constraints, which remember didnt allow any third party applications at all.""<p>Really, who cares if they allow third party apps or not? I don't have a jailbroken iPhone, but I've seen jailbroken apps run smooth as butter, so this mystical ""Apple quality stamp of approval"" argument goes out the window.<p>The post continues:<p>""In fact it was just not feasible to implement hardware accelerated drawing inside windows until recently. Because Android is designed around having multiple windows on the screen, to have the drawing inside each window be hardware accelerated means requiring that the GPU and driver support multiple active GL contexts in different processes running at the same time.""<p>Translation: we designed the system to behave in a way which didn't utilize system resources the best way possible.

These are the exact same recommendations that we have given to Androids app developers, and based on this statement I don't see any indication that there is something intrinsically flawed about Android in making lists scroll at 60fps, any more than there is in iOS.""<p>Nobody said iOS is perfect; yes they have their own flaws (e.g. Safari crashesevery on every once in a while, 3GS sometimes runs out of memory in iOS5, etc), and finding a (edge?) case in which the UI is not smooth on a competing platform seems petty.",1323442487

I like it, but I could live without it.<p>I know there's this cult of ""delightful"" UX design with animated window transitions and so forth, but every time an app stalls or stutters while trying to animate a transition gratuitously it pisses me off.

There's plenty of things I'd fix in Photoshop's UI but adding transitions is not one of them.) I know plenty of Mac OS X users who love Apple to death but switch off every UI animation they can. Let's put it another way -- I love Dropbox and don't think adding ""UX"" crap to it would improve it in any way.<p>The problem is that having made these tradeoffs in Android, either Google or the Carriers then tried to layer a bunch of half-assed UX crap on top of it, and <i></i>surprise<i></i> it doesn't work so well.<p>I'd <i>love</i> a mobile or desktop OS that was all about functionality (which means good, attractive UI design but doesn't require UX frippery).

I don't remember it.  But, I'm confident it was skewed, even amongst the technorati found here at HN.  CentOS is <i>dramatically</i> more popular for web hosting (ask any web host you know that offers both).<p>I think Debian is awesome, and you definitely won't go wrong choosing it for a server (or any system, really).  I'm not at all arguing that Debian is a poor choice--it's a <i>great</i> choice.  I just wanted to point out that 90% seems ridiculously high for Debian market share on web servers.",1224410329

What would happen is that I'd go in, and ask to use the internet. They'd ask me for a passport. I'd say I didn't bring mine. They would then take out a card with a chinese persons face on it (i.e, an already registered internet card with some random person on it), and type those details in. I could then go do what I wanted. They had several of those cards with various people on them. This was true in 4 or 5 different cities. I never showed my passport and they never insisted that I leave.<p>So, even though they build in these mechanisms, there is little enforcement, and the internet cafe owners are more interested in making money than in following some government regulation.<p>By the way, when we say internet cafe here, in china, it's not usually like a 10 seat cafe. It's usually a pretty big hall with 100-200 computers, you can smoke in there, and it's usually packed with people.",1224410291

He seemed to be really bitter about the success or inordinate attention given to people he considered less talented than himself.<p>It was like a kid who joins math club and is deeply distressed to find out that even in math club, there are the popular kids who get away with everything. I sympathize -- I've been that kid. And the Web 2.0 scene was, IS, ripe for satire. But I think Ted (or at least his blogger persona) tended to be more about the rage of the child prodigy that, as an adult, is no longer the center of attention.",1224409904

336998,comment,336980,336990,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"OK, I should have said, ""that <i>support</i> Gentoo"".  Linode and Slice, both of whom I've talked to and know are extremely savvy people, let you pick your own poison...but they don't support what's inside the ""slice"" or ""node"".<p>EngineYard, I'm unfamiliar with. Maybe they just really know what they're doing.  It's possible to make <i>Windows</i> run reliably on servers, if you really know what you're doing...that don't make it a good idea.<p>But, it changes nothing.  Gentoo is, for most users, a horror show on servers.  Probably less than 1% of our users use Gentoo, and about 50% of the batshit crazy problems (the ones of the ""my Apache won't start and says there's a link error with blah blah blah, and when I try to run a PHP script it kills one of my goldfish...why does your software keep breaking my server?"" variety...our software always get the blame, of course, since ours is the UI they see) happen on Gentoo.<p>I'm just trying to help, and trying to be <i>emphatic</i> that Gentoo on a server is <i>begging</i> to suffer.  If you don't really know what you're doing (and often, even if you do), it is so easy to shoot yourself in the foot (or your whole leg, or nuke Idaho), it just doesn't make sense to run it on a production server.<p>I figure I have a lot more data than most people here, since we make systems management software for web servers, and we have millions of people worldwide using it.  I don't intend to piss off the raving Gentoo fans, of which I know there are many, I'm just pointing out that Gentoo is a dramatically more complex system than any other distro, because of basic design decisions...and the amount of testing that any one Gentoo configuration ever gets is miniscule--practically nil--because there are <i>so many</i> possible combinations of ""Gentoo system"".  If you enjoy Gentoo, that's fine.  But, I know what happens when Linux newbies are set loose on a Gentoo system: disaster.  And it happens fast, and in dramatic ways that leave them wondering what happened, and why they didn't keep better backups.  I'll also point out that we <i>support</i> Gentoo with our products (what does that say about us?  nothing good, except that we listen to what our users ask for).  We try to accommodate them and help them, but the marketing for Gentoo has been so effective, and the quality control so ineffective, that it leads a whole lot of newbies down really painful learning paths.  And the culture around Gentoo is one of ""embrace the learning experience""...no matter how painful it is.",1224409467

336993,comment,336819,336819,0,0,jlouis,,,"The key features are <i>isolation</i> and <i>fault management</i>. Isolation means that each process is separated from the others and can only communicate via a safe means. What happens when a process dies? Good systems have far more fault-tolerance.<p>An additional benefit is <i>security</i>. Your model can rely on some processes having the capability to access confidential data. These act as proxies for accessing that data and protects it. The OpenBSD operating system has used this ""privilege separation"" trick for years.<p>Everything with shared memory will die in the long run. The hardware can't keep on fooling us with a big memory space shared among all processes anyway.",1224408326

336991,comment,336980,336980,0,0,qhoxie,,,"You should give us reasons why you have narrowed it down to those 3 and what you level of experience is.<p>I personally use Gentoo or FreeBSD whenever I have a choice.  A significant reason for that is years of experience tuning these for my needs; it has become second nature.<p>For some environments I have used CentOS with good success, but I still end up modifying and trimming things so it feels more like Gentoo.  In the end, you would likely be happy with CentOS, Debian, or Ubuntu as far as binary distros go.",1224407892

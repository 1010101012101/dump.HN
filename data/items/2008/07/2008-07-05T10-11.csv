Indeed, we're communicating across the globe at sometimes the speed of light. But the most difficult questions of our humanity still have yet to be answered. I can't see that ever changing save for God incarnate descending (again?). :)<p>A very influential book for me: A Common Faith by John Dewey - a pragmatic philosopher with a realistic approach and hope.<p>The real problem, to me, is one of literalism vs. metaphor. I read the Old and New Testaments for insight but not history or science. Some would find that appalling. Others appealing. The choice is mine and ours to believe what we want.",1215255558

I was cautiously believing in christ then. Anyway we were discussing the merits of their religion (sovereign chosen by god, underworld or something like that), and it was all clear that their notion of religion was silly and could never be true, yet they passionately believed it. On top of that it was obvious that the ruling class had invented it to serve it's needs (the sovereign was entitled to his position, so was his family and hairs). And then it struck me, what will be different in say 3-4 thousand years into the future, when in some class a child will be learning about christianity, and discussing it's merits. In that exact moment the whole pillar of belief (which my parents were relentlessly building) crumbled like the WTC.<p>Anyway, that's my 2 cents.",1215255143

It's very hard not to see a definition of matter and energy there and given by a ""Saint"".<p>Dawkins here is insisting on a definition for which his professional training gives no special insight. So why should he be recognized as some ""expert""?",1215254036

236843,comment,236808,236840,0,0,robg,,,"What annoys me is so-called scientists writing books where they cloak the discussion in pseudo-science. The scientific method requires hypothesis <i>testing</i>. When a scientist says faith involves delusion, they're really degrading science because anyone with ""faith"" knows it's not an objective reality to be tested. And so they reject science. To me, that explains the backlash against science. Scientists overstepping the bounds of their expertise damage the reputation of science itself.<p>That all said, reason should absolutely be used to examine faith. If your reason forces you to reject <i>a</i> faith, who's to say you must then reject <i>all</i> faith? Sure, you may decide to at any point. But it need not be the end of inquiry.<p>One fact that will always blow my mind for which I don't anticipate a fully rational explication: Right now we're all communicating across a tiny rock in the middle of nowhere. Yet we have the rational means (linguistic, mathematic, scientific) to ponder the depth and extent of our own existence. Call me a theist, but I don't see how that's possible based on strictly finite matter. An evolutionary biologist may spin a story, but it doesn't make it so. So too might an ancient book. Use reason to explore and understand the diversity of faith. In the process I can't see how you won't deepen your own understanding of both.<p>EDIT: If you disagree, say <i>why</i> you disagree even as I don't think I've said anything controversial here. I know some science. I know faith less. This thread is interesting to me exactly because of the seeming prevalence of atheist programmers for which I have no insight into why.",1215253840
236842,comment,236808,236841,0,0,dfranke,,,"<i>All Sagan's books touch the nerve-endings of transcendent wonder that religion monopolized in past centuries. My own books have the same aspiration. Consequently I hear myself often described as a deeply religious man. An American student wrote to me that she had asked her professor whether he had a view about me. 'Sure,' he replied. 'He's positive science is incompatible with religion, but he waxes ecstatic about nature and the universe. To me, that is religion!' But is 'religion' the right word? I don't think so. The Nobel Prize-winning physicist (and atheist) Steven Weinberg made the point as well as anybody, in Dreams of a Final Theory:<p>Some people have views of God that are so broad and flexible that it is inevitable that they will find God wherever they look for him. One hears it said that 'God is the ultimate' or 'God is our better nature' or 'God is the universe.' Of course, like any other word, the word 'God' can be given any meaning we like. If you want to say that 'God is energy,' then you can find God in a lump of coal.<p>Weinberg is surely right that, if the word God is not to become completely useless, it should be used in the way people have generally understood it: to denote a supernatural creator that is 'appropriate for us to worship'.</i><p>--Dawkins",1215253712
236841,comment,236808,236830,0,0,robg,,,"Or lazy.<p>Coming late to this game, I'm still surprised by this attitude in CS circles. To me, an atheist has refused to see the problem in defining one simple term: ""God"". Rejecting one definition (after a half-hearted explication) doesn't solve anything except by ignoring further inquiry.<p>As a neuroscientist, I know that finite matter gives rise to visions of the infinite. To me, that itself is an awe-inspiring moment for which I have no rational basis. Call it what you will (even delusion) but the challenge is to explain it away when no explanation seems adequate.<p>Of course, solving for ""God"" need not be tied to a particular faith. On it's own, it's a personal undertaking where rejecting an understanding in being atheist is certainly one's right. But replace the loaded term ""God"" with something else, say ""Nature"" or ""Infinite"" or ""Universe"" or even ""Matter"", and I can't see how one doesn't tumble back to a more humble position.",1215252908

236838,comment,236808,236808,0,0,dfranke,,,"> It might make sense to think that many such geeks simply find something as simple as a creator an overly simplistic explanation for something so elegant.<p>""Overly simplistic"" is nearly the opposite of the problem.  We <i>want</i> our first principles to be simple -- the fewer axioms, the better.  By contrast, a god is something mind-bogglingly complex, far more complex than the universe itself.  That makes it a thoroughly unsatisfactory explanation.",1215252507

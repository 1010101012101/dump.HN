238420,comment,237955,238369,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"In terms you may understand, the issue everyone is discussing is why the number of black, or latina females, is so low relative their population percentages in the larger society.  In particular, the percentage of latinas in the US college student population is far out of line when considering their population percentage in the larger society.  Even more so when one considers that 2/3rds of university enrollment is female.  That means that, all other things being equal, US university enrollment should be 10% latina, since hispanics constitute 15% of our population.  The thing is . . . latina University enrollment is not 10% of overall University enrollment.  Meaning, for some reason, white women are making it to the University level at a far greater rate.  Why is this?<p>It is a legitimate question to ask, and unfortunately it demands an examination of those obvious differences like "". . . whether you are black, white, hispanic, or whatever . . .""<p>I agree with you, male-female disparities should be discussed as well.  Perhaps you could start another topic?",1215417317

238417,comment,238287,238287,0,0,rms,,,"The controversy on boingboing existed because they refused to say why they removed the link. I don't think the secret is that evil -- I strongly suspect it was done to placate advertisers in general. Advertisers don't like links to porn. Boingboing makes an enormous amount of money so they want to keep advertiseres happy. They should have just said so instead of keeping it a secret.<p>At least I'm hoping it was that reason and not because of a personal feud Xeni had.

Surely that's not the case?<p>When orthodoxy shifts it doesn't mean that the new orthodoxy is right. These things seem to come in 20-30 year cycles (remember the one about how saturated fat caused heart disease? or how breast-feeding was really bad... I mean, really really good?). It occurred to me that maybe one reason for these cycles is the rise of new generations of researchers (it fits the cycle length). The best way to make your mark is by discrediting the theories of the earlier generation. (I'm not suggesting all of science works this way.) This sort of churn is perhaps an indication that skepticism is appropriate. Otherwise you end up with that amusing illusion of how stupid people always were 20-30 years ago.",1215416748

us are using information technologies to their full potential.<p>That being said, I can clearly mark the differences between how I was taught to perform thought functions growing up and how I do them now.

After all, you already have IM and SMS and a gillion other messaging systems.  Twitter was conceived as a blogging platform, but smaller.  Messaging was how you would <i>post</i> to twitter, not what you would <i>do</i> with twitter.<p>Of course, that was wrong.  (How annoying are the twitter users who <i>actually</i> ""answer the question: What are you doing?"")  But that kind of insight only comes out once your product is exposed to real humans.

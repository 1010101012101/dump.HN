They are, for the most part, lost. Not to mention, they will be dead soon.<p>What matters is our generation, and the generations after us. Edward Snowden, Bill Binney, Thomas Drake, and others have made the information available so we can know the truth, and act accordingly. People are now able able to choose, rationally, based on factual evidence, what side of history to be on. The true revolution begins in people&#x27;s minds, after all.

8513543,comment,8512354,8513220,0,0,Dewie,,,"The article is silly, and so is your response. Functional programming most usually, the <i>vast</i> amount of time, refers to a declarative style of programming which involves using functions in the more mathematical sense, which means that one tries to avoid state and side effects. Not necessarily as a compiler-mandated thing, but as a convention. Does one still make &quot;functions&quot; from time to time which are really about mutating state and/or side effects? Yes, but then you would say that they are doing a more procedural/imperative style at that point in time. Like java can be procedural, if you try hard enough.<p>&quot;[...], and all other languages do not.&quot; - Demanding that other languages - which might not self-identify as &#x27;functional&#x27; - <i>not</i> have something seems like a futile demand. Are those languages just gonna be banned by the almighty FP wizards? :)<p>I&#x27;ve never seen things like the syntax of lisp, the homoiconicity of lisp, the lazy evaluation of Haskell, be equated with functional programming as a whole.",1414378520

Snowden&#x27;s response on &quot;how to defend yourself&quot; in June 2013 was: strong cryptography. Today his stance is less optimistic since encryption is never really end-to-end.

You don&#x27;t have to run complex positions, selling a vertical spread is every bit as easy as buying stock (one transaction to open the position, one to close it, and sometimes you don&#x27;t need to close it.)<p>Anybody who wants to tell me options are risky has to explain this: Suppose you want to capture upside in, say, Amazon. Why is it riskier to sell a put spread or buy a call spread, in either case risking just a few hundred dollars, than it is to buy shares when just 25 will cost you $7500 or more?<p>The fact that you mistook the value of theta decay and IV in my proposed scenario of selling a covered call makes me think you just don&#x27;t understand some of these things. And that&#x27;s not your fault, it&#x27;s a huge fail IMO that the retail investor has had to learn the finer points of front load vs back load on some overpriced mutual fund but has been taught that options are scary.<p>Again, I do not advocate for taking long option positions and I definitely think you should check out TastyTrade.com to learn a bit more about the philosophy.",1414376151

In the spring of 1866, however, Drew found an opportunity to achieve a real masterpiece in manipulation. The stock of the Erie road was then selling at about 95 and the company was in pressing need of funds. The treasurer came to the rescue as usual and made the necessary advances on adequate security. The company had in its treasury a considerable amount of unissued stock and had also the legal right to issue bonds to the extent of $3,000,000 which could be converted into stock. Drew took these bonds and the unissued stock as security for a loan of $3,500,000.<p>It so happened, naturally, that Drew was soon heavily short of Erie stock in Wall Street. The market was buoyant; speculation was rampant; and the outside public, the delight and prey of Wall Street gamblers, were as usual drawn in by the fascination of acquiring wealth without labor. All this time our friend, Daniel Drew, was quietly selling Erie stock and closing contracts for the future delivery of the certificates; and he was doing this at rising prices. As the days went by, his grave, desponding manner grew more and more apparent. Erie stock continued to rise. In the loan market its scarcity became greater hour by hour. The rumor began to spread that &quot;Uncle Daniel&quot; was cornered. His large obligations for future delivery must be met. Where was the Erie stock to come from? The stock continued to soar, and Treasurer Drew seemed to become more and more depressed.<p>Then the blow fell. Drew laid his hands on the collateral which he held for his loan to the Erie. In the twinkling of an eye his $3,000,000 in Erie bonds was converted into Erie stock, which he proceeded to dump in Wall Street. Eric quotations fell from 90 to 50. Every one at last realized the trap—but not before Daniel Drew had pocketed a few millions in profits.</i><p>Source: Moody, The Railroad Builders, Chapter 6.<p><a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3036"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3036</a><p><a href=""https://archive.org/stream/cu31924070687961#page/n93/mode/2up"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/stream/cu31924070687961#page/n93/mode/2u...</a><p>The struggle for control that follows the part I quoted is also pretty interesting.",1414375806

So you get 50-minute classes, or about 5/6 of your nominal instruction time.  And if you have to do a lab or something, you either have to do double-period classes or stick to labs that can be effectively completed in 40-45 minutes (because you need time to set up and clean up too).<p>So enter block scheduling: the idea is to lengthen the classes to 90 minutes or so and alternate days when they meet.  You still lose 10 minutes of each class, but that&#x27;s 8/9 of your nominal instruction time, not 5/6.  And teachers get a bit more flexibility in terms of what things can be done with a class.  The drawback is that if you lecture for the full 80 minutes, the outcome is typically not so great: it takes an exceptional lecturer, or an exceptional student, or for some sorts of material both, to pull off someone still being able to absorb information in a lecture that&#x27;s longer than an hour.",1414375658

It&#x27;s pretty clear you could put two of those engines in a AMA sized model, so not exceeding 55 lbf. That&#x27;d give you a thrust-to-weight ratio of greater than 1.0.<p>Yes, a small turbine-powered RC aircraft can easily have a higher thrust-to-weight ratio than a full-sized aircraft, but it&#x27;s not thrust-to-weight ratio that determines top speed; it&#x27;s thrust-to-drag ratio.<p>This is where the square-cube law comes into it. If we take a full-sized delta-winged high performance aircraft like the Eurofighter Typhoon, we could very roughly approximate the difference in drag between that and the model to be proportional to the difference between the square of their wingspans.<p>I&#x27;m guessing the aircraft in the video has a wingspan of 1 m, and the Typhoon has a wingspan of 11 m, so the drag should be greater by something like a factor of 121.<p>However, the Typhoon&#x27;s engines provide a combined 180 kN of thrust, which is greater than the 160 N thrust of the Jetcat P160 by a factor of 1125.<p>So, you can see that the thrust-to-drag ratio of a full-sized jet fighter is something like an order of magnitude larger than for a model aircraft like this, which is the main reason why model aircraft are unable to attain supersonic speeds.<p>Of course, supersonic flight for model aircraft would pose all the same problems it poses for full-sized aircraft; onset of compressibility affecting control surface response, engine inlet geometry and so on.",1414375483

All contemporary cosmological models of the Universe, which are constructed from GR, include dark matter.<p>The &quot;surprise&quot; that is attributed to the discovery of dark matter involves estimates of the mass of a galaxy due to contributions from stars, gas, etc., that fall woefully short of mass estimates obtained from observations of galaxy rotation velocities (kinematics). That is, we know how much mass there is there <i>because</i> of our understanding of gravity, but other methods of measuring the mass don&#x27;t come close to this figure.<p>At galactic size scales GR adds virtually nothing to the Newtonian kinematics, the general relativistic corrections are substantial only when the gravitational field is very strong (e.g., binary neutron stars/black holes, very very near super massive black holes). GR is used in cosmology to model the universe on very large scales; scales so large that the &quot;clumpy&quot; universe that we see comprised of stars, galaxies, galaxy clusters, actually starts to look very, very smooth. Again, even within galaxy clusters, modeling the evolution of the mass in a cluster via GR doesn&#x27;t change much compared with a model using Newtonian gravity.<p>There currently exists no experiments which contradict GR, and a great amount of data (including observations of stars near the Milky Way&#x27;s supermassive black hole) which directly supports it.

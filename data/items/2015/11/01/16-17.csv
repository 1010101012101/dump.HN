(Separate from the discussion of whether FOSS project collaboration should be Slackish or IRCish.)<p>Are there any plans to support multiple teams / multiple servers from the native client? This is a particularly acute pain point on mobile; I&#x27;m reluctant to promote any tool that requires me to be logged in to only one project&#x27;s instance of the tool at a time, because if it works well, it gets adopted for other projects, and then I&#x27;m having to juggle clients. I am unfortunately on two projects that use HipChat, and even there it&#x27;s a huge pain that I can&#x27;t be logged in to both simultaneously on my phone. (Some of their desktop apps finally support multiteam which is a huge help, but I still have to pick just one to participate in on mobile..)<p>Slack isn&#x27;t perfect, but at least all the native clients will let me be logged in to 5 teams at the same time. (And no, opening multiple browser tabs is not an appropriate solution - it doesn&#x27;t work at all on iOS, for example.) And obviously, this is something IRC does a great job of as well.",1446397090

The systemd folks are desktop folks first and foremost, server operations be damned. coredumpctl requires root access, which means one has to be much more diligent in scripting automatic actions to handle core dumps. Failed services again are something that any supervisor service can handle and report -- launchd can get all that information from launchctl. Rootless X is something OpenBSD has had for years, through better access control than linux devs seem to be able to be bothered with.<p>The biggest problem with systemd is its mediocrity. The journal is an interesting idea, but it&#x27;s inflexible. Its insistence on json and internal formats mean that it doesn&#x27;t work with the rest of the extant logging infrastructure tools that exist, so if you want to have a dedicated log server, you have to run essentially two syslogds. Its core dump misfeatures make it harder to use extant access control features to manage files. Its unit files don&#x27;t allow for any sort of extensibility, so adding things like a configtest command for a unit are impossible. In short, its oversimplified itself to the point where it adds a huge management load just to keep servers where they were.",1446396867

Not to mention there was too much of the obvious documentation and not anything regarding subjects where I&#x27;d actually want detailed docs. Although Amazon&#x27;s docs are trash, they have the benefit of everyone and their mother writing about how to do x, y, or z. Whether that&#x27;s a benefit or not, it depends on the author.<p>* Console - The console was sometimes more responsive depending on the action, but for some things was worse. Overall I&#x27;d give this one to GCE as well, but I think the GUI was a mess in places. Perhaps that&#x27;s more based on my total usage of Google Services, which are a superset of GCE. Regarding command line tools though, I felt these were awful, slow, poorly documented, and buggy. Again, maybe an update fixed some of this. Google has a really bad history with consoles. Amazon&#x27;s GUI is 90sish at times, but it&#x27;s been pretty good to me and the API just works.<p>* The answer to this one is really it depends on the machines, location, etc. GCE has some advantages here that are well documented, but performance of a running machine was never really a problem I faced on Amazon provided you select a good instance type.<p>* Can&#x27;t argue here.

I&#x27;ve used both Zulip and Slack in small team (5-20 people) settings and I much prefer Zulip.<p>In particular I like how the zulip UI is single-stream by default. Messages from different channels are interleaved, so you can read all new messages at a glance, but still well separated by visual elements including color - I don&#x27;t find it confusing. And I can focus down to any particular channel , or reply to that channel, in one click.<p>It goes all-in on this &quot;many streams, one view&quot; model with the concept of topics - lightweight &quot;subject headers&quot; for individual sub-streams of a channel. This neatly avoids the &quot;two conversations at once&quot; problems that can occur in other systems occasionally.<p>Some more minor points are a wider range of markup available than slack (including syntax highlighting for code), and better support for short-lived private groups (ie. &quot;a PM between Alice, Bob and Charlie&quot;)<p>As to what I think Slack does better: More one-click integrations (and likely other backend admin stuff that I don&#x27;t see as a simple user). AFAIK Zulip doesn&#x27;t have an irc gateway. Also when I last used it (over a year ago) Zulip&#x27;s mobile client was quite poor.<p>I&#x27;m sure others can come up with more differences - to be honest I tend to treat slack as &quot;slightly smarter irc&quot; so I don&#x27;t pay attention to all the bells and whistles.<p>Finally I should caveat that these same features I like are things people dislike about Zulip - it&#x27;s more dissimilar to existing solutions and people will always have their preferred ways of doing things.

Although, this approach when you have to connect blocks with arrows (which also can be seen in many enterprise ETLs) is not convenient, in my opinion. Text-based programming languages are convenient because you don&#x27;t have to explicitly indicate which line should be executed after which. Function pipelining is so convenient exactly because it eliminates explicit passing results from one function to another. That&#x27;s why in our EasyMorph (<a href=""http://easymorph.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://easymorph.com</a>), which is also a some kind of visual programming language[1] used to replace scripted data transformation, we pack data transformations in logical blocks (very much like function pipelining) so that almost no arrows needed. Another point is about project readability. When all blocks look the same it&#x27;s hard to understand what the function does. So we paid a lot of attention to designing distinct and informative icons.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bi-review.blogspot.ca/2015/06/easymorph-as-visual-functional.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bi-review.blogspot.ca/2015/06/easymorph-as-visual-fun...</a>",1446395743

The data shows that 75% percent of connections can take advantage of QUIC’s zero-round-trip feature.

We were Python, Java, and Go and all were terrible. I&#x27;ve never felt like a company was giving me the middle finger as hard as App Engine. It&#x27;s a terrible product and a shameful dev team.<p>There&#x27;s a million things wrong with GAE besides performance, but if we just focus on that, where to even start? When I first took my last job using GAE, I was able to improve the performance of one of our apps in my 2nd week on the job from requests taking anywhere from 3-14 seconds to sub 1 second. That sounds good, but actually the original authors of the app didn&#x27;t really do anything too bad, it was just they tried to write a standard web CRUD app in Django.<p>The answer to improving performance was mainly to never query their data store if you could help it. Solid advice for most apps, only the queries were completely unpredictable. Pretty much the standard Google answer for all App Engine is to do everything in memcached. OK, again, fine, but then memcached started being unpredictable. Google Answer - we&#x27;ll develop private memcached to let you tweak it more. OK, fine, but it&#x27;s still not as fast as when we run memcached on AWS.<p>Even when we ran our site with 99.9% cache hit ratio, we still had erratic performance. We next switched things to do more on the client and ran an Angular SPA app. Again we saw benefits of course, but still things sometimes were slower than we wanted. Simply Google&#x27;s billing API requests and their slow servers serving requests tended to be the problem, which was often something we had no control over. And that was basically the theme of other problems we had. We figured out the requests problems at the beginning FYI and told Google, and they simply said they would work on it, but actually over time things often got slower.<p>App Engine is a terrible platform and most of the benefits can be replicated by various libraries out there for deployment, versioning, caching, etc. or through admin panels in other services like AWS. If you want to lock yourself into terrible APIs that do things like intercept your POST and re-issue it as a GET, go for it. If you want to start building your apps around billing patterns rather than proper architecture, go for it (how can I do y instead of x to avoid being billed?). I could go on, but yeah App Engine is pretty bad. It gets you going from dev to production somewhat quickly, but don&#x27;t many frameworks + cloud providers do that now? The only real benefit I found which you could argue is that you alleviate some of the security challenges, but that&#x27;s assuming you trust Google&#x27;s environment and configuration (which you have essentially no control).",1446395399

However, most of the FOSS Slack clones miss one vital point: they just provide a random custom API to their clients which may not even be published. Despite being FOSS software they&#x27;re not actually promoting Open Communication - they are just building yet more silos that fragment your conversation history and contacts/contactability even further. If you want to pick your own client, or pick your own server, or interoperate with other comms networks (other than naive bridging), you&#x27;re generally out of luck.<p>This is why I personally believe it&#x27;s vital to support open standards for communication like Matrix.org or XMPP or IRCv3, and build glossy clients and services on top, so that rather than being locked into a single server & client from any given project, we retain the freedom to pick the clients, servers, services and service providers that <i>we</i> want rather than being forced into using particular ones for particular communities. A good start would be for the Zulips and Mattermosts of this world to federate with Matrix or XMPP out of the box, even at the lowest-common-denominator functionality set, to support open communication rather than causing yet more fragmentation.<p>[Disclaimer: I work on Matrix.org]",1446395337

If you do, it&#x27;s as simple as adding a server password (or maybe even changing the default port among some other settings), and anything unwanted will likely be a thing of the past (assuming you don&#x27;t have dedicated people attacking you).<p>On your comment about IRC bots and services, networks don&#x27;t see that as something that is up to them. If something requires a U:line or other network privileges, then it&#x27;s up to the network staff to implement that, sure, but anything else is for their users to do. If IRC networks were for-profit, maybe you could expect them to have things like this and advertise how amazing all of their features are to potential clients. But IRC is nothing but a money sink for everyone involved, and there&#x27;s therefore often little incentive for networks to implement and integrate a lot of bots and functionality that aren&#x27;t integral to network operation.<p>Apart from this, spam is a really hard problem if there are resourceful people dedicated to it. Email has existed for even longer than IRC, and despite absurd amounts of work into anti-spam systems and functionality with it, it&#x27;s not too surprising when spam manages to finds its way into your mailbox.<p>I still agree there&#x27;s a lot of room for improvement, both at the protocol level and at the user level, though.",1446394770

Wait, that last one is out of date. Try using this gist instead.

While Amazon has a confusing and sometimes horrible admin panel, it&#x27;s been my experience as an AWS customer for a long long time that it just works most of the time. Most of the time sounds bad, but it is better than &quot;rarely&quot; or &quot;never&quot; we experienced with Google (more later). When something is broken, Amazon generally fixes it or even a primitive retry will suffice. If something was really broken, Amazon gave us free credit, while Google either lied or hardly budged on bills (even funnier since Google was one of our investors).<p>A related and huge problem we had was that Google tended to make platforms, libraries, features, and services very 1/2 baked. Google is perhaps good at ideas and maybe even better than Amazon at building a solid core, but there is absolutely no follow-through. Too many times we encountered libraries and services that were terminated or overhauled because something was fundamentally broken. Worse, we pointed out big problems months or years in advance along with other customers and the community but saw no action. Google&#x27;s dev team would continue to pretend nothing is wrong until either terminating or going back to the drawing board. I&#x27;ve never experienced a large company burying its head in the sand as much as Google. I love Google search, but I refuse to use any of their cloud products with the attitude that I&#x27;ve seen top to bottom, from sales to dev.<p>Another very important point I think a lot of inexperience people neglect - AWS has great support when it comes to libraries and integrations. Pick x language and generally you can find at least a working version of a library for whatever service you are using, including new features. Google&#x27;s cloud services in my experience are filled with broken, slow, horrible libraries, including the official ones. As an example, there was a really bad (probably still open) form encoding bug in App Engine with multi-part forms that&#x27;s been broken since almost the start of App Engine (basically, anything non-Ascii got corrupted). It&#x27;s never really been fixed despite multiple people giving Google tons of data, patches, and workaround. We even got on the phone with them about it several times. GCE has honestly not been as bad as App Engine in terms of fixing things, but it also lacks features and library integrations.<p>As an example of a more specific GCE problem, anything that has issues with multi-cast had to have tons of patches. There was a special adapter for ElasticSearch when we deployed it on GCE that constantly had to be updated, and if you read about it, you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s mainly a GCE thing. Pretty much every service, tech, or library we used that was more serious had similar issues - there was always a workaround or feature you had to manually implement that you didn&#x27;t realize you took for granted on Amazon. The deployment story just given the tools was always far better on Amazon for example, but that may have changed.<p>Then there&#x27;s installing and developing against GCE. Most of GCE for the past few years was command line only. That&#x27;s fine if your command line is well written and well-documented, but GCE is most certainly not. The command line didn&#x27;t even really work on Windows and not even really with something like cygwin. You can laugh, but at my other company we did a lot of DirectX and Xbox development, and developing on other platforms didn&#x27;t make that much sense. Unfortunately some people in our company decided not using AWS would be cool. Developing against GCE once you got things working was no treat and we felt we often had to write tons of new libraries to do basic things that existed somewhere in the Amazon stack.<p>As far as the documentation, Google&#x27;s services are usually out-of-date and full of mistakes. You could argue the docs are better than what Amazon has, however Amazon has the benefit of the community at this point that generally can answer your questions quickly. Moreover, Google in its own documentation often brags how good their docs are, while simple things like broken links or deprecated features are usually all over the place. How hard is it to run a broken link checker at least? The community is a huge topic, but I&#x27;ll add that support was so bad at some points that the official line was to ask on StackOverflow instead (fine, but you&#x27;re a huge company with a tiny install base at the time, wtf).<p>GCE did (does) have an admin console in addition to the command line, but the early versions were very limited. The last GCE console I worked with was in-step with most Google admin consoles looks like an ASP 2.0 app. Most things in the admin console are far inferior to the command line and full of bugs. Even finding the right settings in the admin console are a complete nightmare and sometimes require you to open other Google Services that you would think have no impact on GCE, App Engine, or anything else, and yet do. They often re-arrange how all of this works, but then leave parts of the old sites still running, so you end up with crazy nesting, conflicting options and navigation, and randomness. Mostly you feel like some dev somewhere kept saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel like doing this, so I&#x27;ll put this all here because I can.&quot; It all looks like a bad assignment done last minute in a computer lab for a comp-sci class.<p>I know I seem a bit harsh, but I really wanted to try something new besides AWS the last few years. I joined 2 companies that did exactly that (independent of me), and that ended up terrible for both. There really was not much I couldn&#x27;t do on AWS that GCE could do, while AWS could do plenty of things that GCE could not do at the time. AWS was far more reliable, stable, and well-supported for us as well, along with my own startup, and my past companies. Given I was a customer of Google&#x27;s for a long, long time along with Amazon&#x27;s and little changed with Google, I doubt it is much different now. Maybe someone can correct me, but usually when we get into these kinds of debates, the person with high opinions about GCE and the Google Cloud in general has not been on it long and certainly has not hosted a serious environment on it. I find Amazon as a company somewhat repulsive like Google in various ways, but AWS for all its faults is definitely more popular for a reason still. I hope Google can push Amazon to make their platform better, but from what I have seen the last few years, GCE is half-baked and only suitable if you&#x27;re throwing a few small or personal servers in the cloud without significant interactions between them.",1446394516

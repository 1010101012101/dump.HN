There&#x27;s a lot less ecosystem needed there; mostly just bindings to whatever database you need to talk to, possibly some other stuff.<p>So if you&#x27;re just going to be exposing a RESTful API backend for a JavaScript based frontend, or even for a Rails app frontend to talk to, Rust makes a lot more sense.<p>Also, the only way an ecosystem gets bootstrapped up is by people scratching their own itches. By starting to write web services in Rust now, and implementing those things that aren&#x27;t yet implemented, you can help to bootstrap it up. Of course, that only works if you have the extra time to spare to do so, but for those things that only need one or two extra things that don&#x27;t yet exist, it may pay off due to the lower chances of having to debug runtime errors, less time and complexity spent trying to make it scale out, etc.",1454276736

If you look at the number of GitHub repos by language, you find a similar pattern.<p>However, you go to sites like Hacker News and others that are more about idle discussion, and it&#x27;s hard to find people who will even admit to working with non-sexy industry standard languages.

The way to get started with concurrent programming in Rust is thread::spawn, Sender, and Receiver, which will take you far. But C++ doesn&#x27;t even have channels in the standard library; it encourages you to dive headfirst into shared memory, which makes simple concurrency needlessly difficult.<p>Rust doesn&#x27;t restrict you from using shared memory when you need to (and verifies that it&#x27;s safe when you do). But Rust&#x27;s libraries and ecosystem encourage you to design your apps in shared-nothing fashion <i>first</i>, and only to introduce memory sharing when you need it for performance. That&#x27;s a much friendlier way to deal with concurrency than mutexes, locks, and futures.",1454276467

IQAir machines are built around a very heavy-duty prefilter that traps all the hair, dust, and large particles (maybe pollen-size?).  The HEPA filter thus only gets a stream of tiny particles, so it lasts quite a while.  Other models I&#x27;ve used (Plasmacluster, Rabbitair) do fine with brand-new filters but quickly accumulate dust that you have to vacuum out, and even then, the HEPA filter is probably already ruined.  They also aren&#x27;t sealed as well, so you don&#x27;t get to hold up your particle counter to the exhaust and see a nice &quot;0&quot;.  (But the particle count in the room does decrease versus not running them, so they do do something.)<p>The IQAir machines don&#x27;t need any maintenance other than buying new filters when it tells you to.  If you are trying to save money, don&#x27;t buy IQAir.<p>I try to evaluate effectiveness qualitatively and quantitatively.  When I first got an air filter for my bedroom, I noticed that suddenly I didn&#x27;t feel like coughing all night long.  When I got the IQAir for my bedroom, I woke up the next morning with a sore throat because the back of my throat was totally dry.  My chronic post-nasal drip was gone.  It could have been my imagination, so I bought a laser particle counter to measure the particle count in my room.  It was 0.  (And it&#x27;s counting the sub-micron particles.)<p>(There are some caveats.  Moving around in bed is particle city, so you&#x27;re not breathing 100%-fresh air all night.  But the filters take care of things very quickly, and I run them on a high setting, and they&#x27;re close to my bed.  You&#x27;ll need earplugs.  Air filters on the &quot;silent&quot; setting do approximately nothing.  This was not a problem for me because I&#x27;ve slept with earplugs for years due to annoying cats.

This is a process that has been going on since the &#x27;90s--remember that in the &#x27;90s practically all software was written in C++, whereas in 2016 most new programmers aren&#x27;t even learning it anymore. C++ has been declining not because it&#x27;s being replaced but because its domains have become smaller and smaller. Rust is just a continuation of that trend: now there&#x27;s a better option for security-critical software that can&#x27;t be written in a GC language for performance and/or flexibility reasons (to name Rust&#x27;s strongest domain), which has reduced the domain of C++ just as Java did 15 years ago for the server space and the rise of the iPhone App Store did in 2008 for the consumer app space.

When I was in industry, if I needed an antenna designed, I would just go hire an RF engineering firm. Now I can spend time hacking on it myself, which I really enjoy\n4. Absence of corporate bullshit, which has traditionally included tremendous IT freedom, no centralized control of messaging / official PR line, etc. \n5. Generally no IP bullshit unless you want it -- everyone loves open-source, etc. AMP is a real leader here.<p>Things that are a challenge:<p>1. project management is often lacking -- it can be hard to focus, and the freedom to explore is a double-edged sword of &quot;it&#x27;s been 18 months, what papers have we actually finished?&quot; \n2. The pay isn&#x27;t great -- CS postdocs make $60-70k/year. Fortunately I can consult on the side to pad this out. \n3. A lot of your inputs are 23-year-old graduate students, who are smarter than you, enthusiastic, and inexperienced. This can be a fantastic source of new creative ideas, but sometimes they also decide to switch from julia to rust 80% of the way through a project. Sometimes you wish you could just hire that RF engineer and get shit done (see above above)<p>tl;dr : I get to build the coolest shit with the most amazing people helping me and learn a ton of new things, in an environment which generally shares my values.",1454275704

I looked into it, and found:<p>* The worst scripting language ever, seemingly made by someone without even basic theoretical knowledge of language parsing.  It&#x27;s even worse than shell scripting.<p>* The same I-don&#x27;t-care copypasta culture most autotools users seem to follow, but the free documentation was even worse (or at least back when I tried it).  There&#x27;s a book which I didn&#x27;t have access to, though.<p>* Less enduser/packager friendly, with worse help texts, documentation, and features (seems to have caught up somewhat).  Plus, everybody already knows how configure scripts work.<p>* The portability to Windows in reality means lots of if(WIN32) branches.<p>* The results are often brittle.  This is also true of autotools in practice, but at least there is some info out there about how to write autoconf macros correctly.  Even the .cmake files that ship with CMake seemed to be thrown together carelessly the last time I looked.<p>* Also, CMakeLists.txt must be the worst filename for a script I&#x27;ve ever seen.  I&#x27;m only half serious on that one.  I know it doesn&#x27;t matter, but it bothers me terribly.  It&#x27;s ugly and misleading and makes me question the author&#x27;s sense of aesthetics and basic competence.<p>CMake is terrible.  Autotools is also terrible, but at least it&#x27;s got an excuse.  Just learn your damn tools.  The real problem with autoconf is that nobody wants to invest any time learning about their build system and instead just copy-pastes it around, creating a brittle mess.  From the CMake projects I&#x27;ve seen, it doesn&#x27;t really solve this problem at all, creating a similar mess.  And now your users have to install CMake and figure out how it works, and it doesn&#x27;t even print a useful --help text.",1454275565

Historically normal tax rates were around 10%, not the ~40% typical for most industrialised nations today. From around 1910 to 1950, there was a massive push to centralise control of economies, move nations off the gold standard and onto fiat currencies, expand credit as a means to reduce poverty, and massively increase state spending. The &quot;normal&quot; state of affairs now is largely a creation of specific government policies at that time.<p>Somalia&#x27;s a crime-ridden hellhole - I&#x27;m not an anarcho-capitalist and I believe that freedom requires the rule of law. Hong Kong and Singapore are two places which remain close to the pre-WWI classical liberal ideal of genuinely free economies with the rule of law, and both have income tax rates of around %10 IIRC.

For example:<p>At first glance, it may seem elegant to have\nEENTER restore the contents of the XCR0, FS, and GS registers in the current SSA, and have EXIT restore them from the current SSA. However, this approach would break the Intel architecture’s guarantees that only system soft-ware can modify XCR0, and application software can only load segment registers using selectors that index\ninto the GDT or LDT set up by system software (2.7). Specifically, a malicious application could modify these\nprivileged registers by creating an enclave that writes the\ndesired values to the current SSA locations backing up\nthe registers, and then executes EEXIT.<p>If that&#x27;s correct (I haven&#x27;t double-checked thoroughly, but it seems like it&#x27;s wrong), then it&#x27;s a problem.  But I think the paper is just wrong.<p>I&#x27;d be more worried about RFLAGS in the SSA.  Its exact usage is poorly documented, but some bits of RFLAGS are privileged (IF and IOPL).",1454274014

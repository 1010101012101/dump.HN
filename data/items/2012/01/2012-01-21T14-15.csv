3493664,comment,3492988,3493345,1,0,henrikschroder,,,"> I'm just saying we need some light direct democracy influences in the republic<p>Yes, that is what proportional representation and a plurality of political parties achieve. In the last elections here, I first selected one of the major blocks of parties, and then a specific party within that block. That way my vote gets a little bit more power, I get to say something about the general political foundation, and I get to say something about specific issues that are important to me.<p>If the party I generally vote for does something I'm completely against, I don't have to abandon the fundamentals, I can still keep my vote within the bigger block, but shift it to another party, which means the entire block shifts direction ever so slightly.<p>This way, outside voter forces act on the blocks to change them and shape them, instead of that process being completely internal and driven by their perception of popular opinion.<p>> And I'm only asking to postpone the bill and have set-up some kind of open debate process<p>The biggest problem with this is that politics is all about compromise. It's about giving and receiving, about making deals. It allows parties to get their way in issues they and their voters care deeply about, in exchange for not getting their way in less important issues.<p>But if you add an open debate process, you lose the bigger picture. Different parts of the public, different organizations will get involved in different issues, and completely ignore others, and each organization will act as if their issue is the only important one, and not be willing to budge an inch. For every issue you can always find enough people that cares very deeply about it, but it's much harder to see the bigger picture, how <i>many</i> people actually care deeply about a certain issue? And I think that only by giving them the power to vote can you really find out.",1327157552

It should allow you to input titles that may not be available on the platform, but work as a preference indicator (for example, I like House and Battlestar Galactica)<p>* It should allow for social subtitling, perhaps even with a reward system - for free;<p>* Charge 1/1$ or less per paid TV episode, 2 or less for film. Better yet, 10/$ flatrate per device.

3493622,comment,3492912,3492912,57,0,loso,,,"10 years ago I was a small time hip hop DJ who did some clubs and radio. Before I became a programmer, my dream was to become the next Puffy. I studied the industry big time (reading books, talking to people inside, doing interviews) and still do. I also worked security for years for the main purpose of being able to interact with the people behind the scenes (managers, promoters, etc). So even though I am not an expert, I know a decent amount about the music industry.<p>First of all I see some talk about how you can predict a hit. No, you can't. You have basic formulas that you know can do okay but a hit is usually a surprise. No one could predict Adele would be as big as she is now. Her first album was very good but it did not pick up steam in the US market. Lady Gaga was bounced around as well. She was almost dropped from her record label until Akon picked up the slack and was able to do something with her. Basically what I'm saying is that after something is made you may be able to tell that it is going to be big but you have to craft it first. While crafting it, you are not going by formula but what feels right. You don't know that it is going to be a hit while you are making it.<p>Second, you have to understand the record label model to be able to disrupt it. The point systems, mechanical royalties, publishing, different rules for selling overseas, etc. This is what the labels are good at. This is the moat to their castle. In the past, (before around 2002 or so) record labels would put out a bunch of artist and see which one stuck. They would lose money on 80 - 90% of their artist because all they needed was one or two to make it big to make their money back. Minor artist would also be able to make the label profits through the use of singles. But the record labels gave up the singles model for the larger profit margins of albums. Now it is different.<p>Now they have to be real careful who they put out. The profit margins are a lot thinner now than what they used to be. Piracy is one reason but a bigger reason is the more places for people to be able to spend their disposable income. The record labels did not make a pivot to change the way they did business when the economic problems hit. Instead the industry shrunk down and now we have less labels. But they are still doing business in the same fundamentally screwed up way that they did in the past. In their mind, why change something that has worked for over 50 years. Think Kodak and the reason for their recent bankruptcy.<p>The one thing they did change is how to make artist pay more for the squeeze that the record labels are feeling. New artist these days have to bring to the table a built in fan base. The label then will try to expand that base. For the most part, if you want to be signed to a record label these days then they have to know that you have a track record with fans. Take an artist like Whiz Khalifa. He already had a big buzz when the record labels signed him. He could have made a lot of money staying independent. But most artist want the international fame that accompanies the major record labels. So he signed with them so they could push him internationally. In the past having a buzz would help you get signed but it was not the only factor. Now in most cases, you HAVE to have a big buzz.<p>The labels are also making the artist pay more in a new type of deal structure. This signing is called a 360 deal. In the past, the deal basically was that an artist would receive a (relatively) low amount of points on a record put out. This is especially true if you were a new artist. But it didn't matter because if the record did well they could tour off of it. The tour and merchandise money was basically the artist only. This is how they would get rich. Now record labels have made sure they get a part of that money as well. A 360 deal makes an artist have to cut the record label in when it comes to merchandising and tour money. AND they still get low points on the album. You either accept this new industry practice or you do not get signed.<p>The record labels are ripe for disruption. New artist are available all of the time. But you not only have to study what the labels got wrong, you also have to study what they got right. First, musical talent is only part of the equation when it comes to selling music. People have to be personally invested in the artist. They have to like them and think that they know them. Record labels are experts at this. An artist either has to relate to the consumer or the artist has to be someone they idolize. Think of it like the Fanboy trap that we see when it comes to tech. Go to any gossip blog site. People argue about the artist as if they know them. Some people love them for no reason and others hate them for no reason. But the key factor is that they love talking about them. So if you build software to disrupt the industry, this has to be in the equation. Your service has to allow people to have a personal connection with the artist. None of the music services now do this. They let you listen to the artist but the connection is already built in from somewhere else. I would say the best right now at doing this is Youtube. But even Youtube could do a lot better job of it. MySpace was kinda on the right path but bad design decisions killed that.<p>Second, a new service to disrupt the industry would also have to think about the people who make the artist what they are. The stylist, the make up people, the manager, the promoters, the background singers, and etc. An artist is a package. And you would have to allow for that package to be dealt with in a new disruption model. The record labels feed a lot of people and a lot of those people are vital for a record and an artist to be pushed.<p>I have a lot more that I have to say about this subject but I have already built up a wall of text so I'll cut it here. I'm a little bit passionate about this topic because I have seen for years how the label system screws both artist, DJ's and fans. They need to be brought down and brought down hard but it will not be easy. The one thing that you will find is that most artist have no business sense. They want to be able to create and that's it. We see this line of thinking with some software programmers as well. But programmers usually keep a steady job. Most artist have a short shelf life.

Now there are other ways, but they are not yet widespread enough, h.264 is consequently still necessary as a fallback.<p>Outside of Flash browsers are not terribly bad at supporting h.264 either. WebM might be doing better  but not by much. Thats the problem.<p>What someone who picks a video format is thinking: Many dont have built-in support for video so we have to use Flash one way or another. h.264 is the format of choice when using Flash so we need our video in h.264. Oh, and look, that same h.264 video works in a ton of browsers without Flash. So we get kick-ass HTML5 video out of it, too, without doing any additional work. Also: iOS. WebM doesnt even figure into this thinking and why should it? It would only complicate things for minimal gains.<p>For WebM to claim decisive victory it would need widespread support (Im guessing well north of two thirds) and h.264 would have to lag very far behind. It doesnt look like that will be happening anytime soon.<p>h.264 is the strong incumbent, it would take overwhelming force to take it out.<p>(By the way, when does WebM come to Flash again? I dont think it is already but I think they announced it. Im not even sure whether that will change much about the dynamic, mostly due to inertia, but I might be wrong.)",1327155553

When you find the film you want to watch you are given the option to buy it using your credit, if you have bought it there will be download links available: direct/HTTP download as well as something more robust (able to stop and restart half way through with ease). What you get to download is simply a video file (mp4, mkv, something like that) of the episode itself: No adverts stuck onto it, no digital hand cuffs, no hidden water marks than identify you personally: Just the video you want to watch. You can then watch it on your computer as many times as you want but you are not allowed to upload it to the internet or broadcast it publicly etc.<p>I think this is a good idea because it gives people freedom from DRM and harassment and similar such things (many people that currently use torrents do so because they do not like these anti-freedom technological devices). I do not know whether or not any publishers would actually sell licenses for a site like this to use though, I imagine they will argue that as soon as one person downloads it then you can't stop them uploading it and giving it to everyone so they'll get no sales.. in fact this is not a good argument because all this stuff is already available on torrent and file sharing sites.<p>I hope I explained this clearly and suitable for this site.

  4% world share of Firefox 3.6 users -> webm

  iOS/Mac growth -> mostly h.264
  Android growth -> both
  23% loss for h.264 if/when chrome drops support<p>Why webm still doesn't matter yet: demographics and fallback availability.
The devices that exclusively support h.264 are more valuable users for video (mobile, console, set top box) and have no fallbacks. Most of the webm support base (desktop Firefox, chrome) can fall back to flash h.264 player. Half of the webm support base presently supports h.264 natively anyways (chrome, android)<p>Other notes: 
- webm support can be trivially added to desktop safari and IE9+ by mildly tech savvy users.
- h.264 tools and encoders are better and hardware encode/decode support is far better
- the openness and cheapness of webm will probably improve its tool and hardware support in the long run especially if/as uncertainty about its patent status declines.",1327154454

That's a hard feeling to overcome, if you're spending a lot of time studying with no sense of purpose or intrinsic motivation, while your peers are excited about their work. I remember interviewing and visiting engineering companies, trying to imagine myself working there. For all the talk about engineering teaching you how to ""solve  hard problems,"" most jobs were not at all the creative, inventive type I had thought.<p>Sometimes, students come in with the wrong understanding of a major or career type. For example, ""I liked studying chemistry in high school, so let me study chemical engineering,"" thinking they're the same.

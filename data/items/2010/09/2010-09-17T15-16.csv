The biggest thing that seems to trip people up is figuring out (before they build it!) if there's a way to scalably acquire customers.  Unless people have a well-understood distribution channel they can tap and an ARPU obviously high enough to buy customers through it, entrepreneurs generally have to hustle (sell 1 customer at a time, beg for coverage, write targeted linkbait, etc).

Xbox Zune is even slower: the switch to movies takes many seconds. Perhaps this is setting up encryption modules - but it's absurd.

1701533,comment,1699768,1701391,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>A lot more ""longevity"" than just a blog</i><p>A. I'm not sure I believe this. I have bought three or four books which were compiled from blogs. They all felt really dated within a couple of years. I read each of them zero to one time and then sold them off; after all, the material is there online if I need to refer to it again. And sometimes the online version even gets refreshed.<p>B. Books only have more ""longevity"" than blogs if you are a librarian, or at least an amateur librarian. You must keep them around on your shelf for a long time, dust them off, carry them from place to place. It pains me to say this, as a former book collector and the son of two book collectors, but in the networked era print book archiving is like collecting and preserving fine art: A vital activity for a handful of professionals, but a niche hobby for everyone else. <i>Especially</i> for content that was born in digital form.<p>C. Books don't collect links. Except possibly to (e.g.) Amazon, which helps Amazon's SEO but contributes nothing to your own. It might be the height of irony for Patrick to publish a dead-trees book which advises you to publish everything on your own web site where it can attract inbound links.",1284738424

Having a fully functioning web interface for outlook web access or sharepoint shouldn't be a big deal, but it is a constant problem, you cant force people to use IE, embrace the alternatives.<p>Added features are not always good, we know Office is a cash cow, but it is also heavy as hell, offer a slim down office suite, not in software, but in features, or at the very least, allow people to easily turn them off. And please please dont do this format change again (from doc to docx) it was a real dick move. oh yeah, embrace and promote open formats.<p>While we are on the office issue, WHAT THE HELL is your problem with full compatibility between office for mac and windows office, where is access? why did you remove vbscript from the apple product? did you think people will abandon macros? seriously, what the hell are you doing with this one<p>Add single instance storage capability to your entire server line, it may sound as a minor feature only but it would make your server line better, also simplify your licensing schemes across the board, it is antiquated and annoying for IT staff who wish to be compliant. while we are at it, powershell and cmd, should incorporate unix commands, why not?<p>Xbox development should open up more, the Xbox market should be more plugin oriented, services like Pandora would give the best product Microsoft had in years, extra boost.<p>It wont hurt Microsoft to acknowledge the brilliance of other companies, parroting the line that Microsoft invented the Tablet form factor in the face of the ipad and latching windows7 as an alternative to Ios is shortsighted and makes you look outdated and somewhat ridiculous, paradigm shifts should be acknowledged. Please reconsider the courier.<p>While we're at it, Crapware and glut should be abhorred and disdained and discouraged. if i buy a new windows7 machine, i dont want to reformat it to get rid of the trialware, crapware that is loaded on the average dell etc... Do you know how much of a performance degradation this stuff does? its comical. the speed (and often stability) gained by the  computer you just bought when you perform a clean install, makes it feel like a different computer. you will also save time for small business IT.<p>Microsoft, you are rarely loved, and only admired with caveats. Work on your image better, you outspend Apple on marketing but still manage to look bad, you are not getting your money worth. Get Microsoft Surface technology to museums and public serving institutions, it will help them serve the public, it will help you look cool.",1284736049

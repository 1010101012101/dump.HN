Let me explain by way of analogy:<p>Reddit and HackerNews are two sites on the internet, each with their own community of commenters. Let us assume for the sake of argument that Reddit users enjoy inane off-topic humor in their comment threads, and HackerNews users enjoy thoughtful posts with occasional dry wit. Let us also assume that Reddit users can post on HackerNews using their Reddit credentials, and vice versa.<p>After some analysis of their comment threads, Reddit makes the following claim: Reddit users drive communities! After all, nearly all of the comments on the site are inane banter from Reddit users. People from HackerNews rarely comment on the site, and Reddit's indicators of comment quality show that Reddit users generally post higher quality comments. They get so many upvotes!<p>But on the other hand, HackerNews claims that HN users drive communities! After all, nearly all of the comments are thoughtful and insightful posts from HackerNews users. People from Reddit hardly ever comment on HN articles, and Paul Graham's indicators of quality show that HN users generally post higher quality comments. Reddit comments tend to get downvoted to oblivion.<p>Anyways, I just wanted to show by this example that if you take a service that caters to a particular demographic, and ask its users to rate each other, of course you will find that the demographic comes out in a positive light.",1326174941

If you're a startup, you're better off using a more mainstream language. I'm from India and if I start to find a good Haskell or Scala programmer I'll be looking for a long time and I'll be paying him/her a lot for those skills. Being a startup, you start small and its tempting to start using the bleeding edge technologies, but you <i>must</i> do a cost-benefit analysis; coders for PHP and Java are much easier to find and since the supply is more, the cost of skills will be less.<p>Bootstrapped startups should particularly be wary of using technologies that have a very small talent pool in their part of the world. Use new/rare technologies if the benefits of using them outweigh the hassle and expenses of maintaining and extending the team/codebase for it.",1326174646

For example, a source of technical bias could be that it is a simpler process to log into a Disqus pseudonym than to authenticate with Facebook when posting. Usability is incredibly important in attracting repeat users, so if it is easier to post under a disqus username then it is not surprising that pseudonymous users post more frequently. Another source of obvious selection bias is the disqus branding: I expect people who have Disqus accounts are both more likely to frequent blogs, and are more likely to recognize that they can easily comment on a blog with a Disqus comment section. By way of contrast, Facebook users may not even recognize that they have the credentials to easily comment, and may be reluctant to share their credentials with your third party service except in cases where they have a strong opinion about a piece of content.<p>I can see the data on comment quality being more objective and interesting, but even here there is probably selection bias: if most of the indicators of quality come from Disqus accounts' appraisals, then you may be measuring whatever bias Disqus users have as regards comment quality from Facebook commenters.",1326172952

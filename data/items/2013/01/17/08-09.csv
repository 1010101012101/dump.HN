One of the things we have to do often is open a >10mb logfile on a cifs share and quickly search through it. It takes ST2 over 10seconds to open the file. The same for each refresh of the file.

5071682,comment,5071001,5071001,1,0,sjreese,,,"The point Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves. The worlds entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences? Youll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier..<p>There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up until now will have been lost.<p>That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? Its outrageous and unacceptable.<p>I agree, many say, but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and its perfectly legal theres nothing we can do to stop them. But there is something we can, something thats already being done: we can fight back.<p>Those with access to these resources  students, librarians, scientists  you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out. But you need not indeed, morally, you cannot  keep this privilege for yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords with colleagues, filling download requests for friends.<p>Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your friends.<p>But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. Its called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isnt immoral  its a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.<p>Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate require it  their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the politicians they have bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who can make copies.<p>There is no justice in following unjust laws. Its time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture.<p>We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access.<p>With enough of us, around the world, well not just send a strong message opposing the privatization of knowledge well make it a thing of the past.

Because of the vast number of people coming on line, there are always those who do not know what a crawler is, because this is the first one they have seen. Almost daily, we receive an email something like, ""Wow, you looked at a lot of pages from my web site. How did you like it?"" There are also some people who do not know about the robots exclusion protocol, and think their page should be protected from indexing by a statement like, ""This page is copyrighted and should not be indexed"", which needless to say is difficult for web crawlers to understand.</i><p>That about sums it up: the laws largely reflect the foot-stamping of non-technical people who wanted copies to be more like apples on a tree and less like reflections in a pool. To be sure, it is possible to commit real crimes using the Internet: securities fraud (real fraud), invasion of privacy, uttering threats, etc, but copying itself should not be criminal.<p><i>>""I could just as easily argue it's fraud to restrict any copying via a network that functions for that purpose.""\n""Where is the appropriation by deception in this?""</i><p>The deception is of copying <i>as appropriation</i>, which I consider impossible. The appropriation on your part (the royal ""you"") is 1) the loss of my freedom to surf/access the net using the tools and methods of my choosing (with any user agent string or MAC I want, or by scanning an IP block, or by sending a multicast packet), and 2) your gain of copies <i>as</i> a store of value.<p><i>""Are you really claiming that people don't change MAC address in order to avoid being identified with previous use under a particular MAC address, that it's not solely to mask identity.""</i><p>No, I am saying a MAC was not an identity to begin with. Sites use technical means to limit some access, while usually leaving others open (there has to be some way for users to get at the bits). Why should anyone assume those means left open shouldn't simply be used instead? (The discriminator could have discriminated further, to an arbitrary degree, since the rules only exist in software.)<p>Again, it boils down to your definition of ""unauthorized"" which is defined firmly in one camp (not that copy, it's <i>mine</i>!) and equally firmly but very differently in another camp (copying is easy; copying will always be easy). The people who regularly apply access controls and maintain the networks largely assume other people could too, if they wanted to, so what feels like ""security"" for one person (a MAC address) isn't considered ""security"" for others. (I'm not speculating about Aaron's views, I'm talking about mine. I agree, I don't think he did anything wrong.) The general feeling is one of all-or-nothing access amongst those who define the locks; part of the hacker/inquisitive mindset is not wanting there to <i>be</i> any locks they can't bypass.<p>That lock analogy is problematic. Using an elaborate means to copy is not the same as breaking into a building by climbing through a window. Copying (looking) doesn't cause bodily harm or deprivation, and so is not fraud. Lots of people want to claim it can cause financial harm, but I don't buy that one either. Non-commercial copyright infringement is basically free advertising: the sort of word-of-mouth you pay through the nose for. Paying up-front for a copy is absurd; you pay after you hear the minstrel, and you only pay if you liked the music. You can stop playing music for me, but you can't, with accuracy, call me a thief for listening <i>or</i> not paying.<p>Keep in mind I'm describing what I think should be, not what I think the laws are. You are free to disagree, but this is the context for my comments.<p>The Internet was, and is, and remains a copying (looking) free-for-all, where code is law. That doesn't make it a wild west that needs to be civilized either - there's nothing to civilize in the absence of copyright. It doesn't mean we have to pull in property and theft analogies... This is still exclusively about copying. As little as 10 years ago we all thought copying would bring some kind of digital salvation: access to all human knowledge. (Enter Wikipedia...) Turns out we want to monetize copying instead, so we are reducing individual freedoms and access rights. Yes, reducing. <i>Give me a break.</i> (For the sake of keeping up with your exasperations.) I already pay my ISP for the link. The copying is implied.<p>Copying is only scary because you don't know the person doing it - but they aren't doing it <i>to</i> you; copying isn't an injury.<p>I run an SSH server, and I prevent access to it as well. I also run a wireless access point with a pretty simple password. I don't care if someone uses the wireless if they find the password. Good on them. If they use it to commit a crime I do, but using it is not the crime. Similarly, if they find the password to the SSH server, also good for them; if they find the password to the SSH server <i>and</i> commit an actual crime, then there will be charges (though not from me unless I was the victim), but <i>looking onto</i> a property (a physical computer) is not a crime. You have to forget about that if you want to monetize information, but that's why there's a lack of common ground between the two camps: there's no property to speak of.<p>Admittedly, there are a number of laws based on the idea that copying should be illegal (copyright as an obvious example). I'm not ignorant of them, but I challenge them. (Granted, I probably wouldn't be willing to put myself in Aaron's situation to challenge them.) I think they can only be enforced at the cost of physical ownership rights and I'm a ""law-as-code"" kind of guy. I want to be able to believe that if someone didn't want me to copy something, I wouldn't be <i>able</i> to copy it, or I at least want us to admit that making a copy can't actually hurt someone (the copy itself, not what you might proceed to do with it).",1358411567

This allows businesses to have in-house hardware support, without having issues with the provided warranty.<p>There's a lot of things I like about MacBooks.

5071614,comment,5069227,5069965,2,0,dmfdmf,,,"Good review but ""qualitatively different"" is a bit of an understatement.<p>tl;dr: Chernobyl/RBMK reactors are inherently dangerous in nuclear design and in operation without suitable containment structures, unlike Western reactors like TMI or Fukushima.<p>TMI and Fukushima are comparable to a degree but it is important to note that TMI is a Westinghouse pressurized water reactor whereas the Fukushima plants are GE boiling water reactors. TMI had a LOC event due to a stuck pressurizer vent valve that went undetected after a reactor scram which, combined with incorrect assumptions in the operating procedures, led to a core melt. Fukushima experienced station black out which means loss of both offsite and backup power.  The reactors shutdown and operated as designed for this scenario but the design basis assumption is that power would be restored in 4 or 5 days (don't know the exact number). It actually took more than a week to restore power due to the devastation of the earthquake and tsunami. Core cooling was maintained by discharging steam into the containment cooling pools but this method can not be run indefinitely and as the pools overheat it threatens the containment. Without a source of power the H2/O2 recombiners could not safely burn off the hydrogen which led to explosions of the reactor service buildings.<p>In contrast, the RBMK reactors are graphite moderated but water cooled. The reason for this design was they were developed for civilian power generation by scaling up military reactors used for plutonium production for nuclear weapons (graphite moderator allows fuel extraction without shutdown). During low power operation, the RBMK design has a positive reactor power void coefficient. What this means is that an increase in power lowers the density of the water coolant which allows more neutrons to escape into the graphite moderator where they are slowed down and thus split more atoms. In other words these reactors have an inherently dangerous operating region where an increase in power can lead to more power in a positive feedback cycle. This is what destroyed the Chernobyl reactor. (Note that water moderated reactors such as TMI or Fukushima have a negative power void coefficient where an increase in power reduces the density of the coolant and moderator which allows neutrons to escape the core without causing a fission thus dropping power, the opposite of an RBMK)<p>Of course the designers were aware of the positive power void coefficient, so they added safety systems to prevent reactor operation in bad regions. On the night of the accident, a maintenance shutdown was scheduled but on scram the operators wanted to run a turbine spin down test, i.e. after the scram, see how long the residual steam could drive the turbines before backup systems had to be operational. Previous attempts to run these tests had failed and the operators were pressured by Moscow to get it done or else (Siberia?). To maximize the chance of a successful test the operators maneuvered the reactor into the low core flow, low power region of the reactor's operating domain with the dangerous positive void coefficient and thus positive power feedback.  To get the reactor into this state the operators had to override numerous safety systems designed to prevent such operation. At the commencement of the test there was a power excursion that led to a power runaway that cause a steam (not a nuclear) explosion that blew the lid off the reactor.<p>One final important point, the Chernobyl reactors (and all RBMKs) are not housed in any containment structure like Western reactors (they are too big). The containment buildings of reactors like TMI or Fukushima are designed to withstand and contain the operating energy and nuclear material should anything go wrong and as these accidents have shown, they work. The Chernobyl accident was made much worse because the lack of containment allowed widespread dispersion of radioactive material due to the explosion and subsequent graphite fire.",1358410590

The researchers ranked companies by average citations per patent, as a proxy measure for quality of their innovation. That would typically be higher for companies that only file a handful of key patents, like Pixar does, rather than companies like IBM that file tens of thousands of patents. But it still doesn't really say much about innovation either way. If company A files 2 high-profile and 0 obscure patents, while company B files 10 high-profile and 50 obscure patents, company A will have more citations per patent on average, but it's not clear that's measuring anything about innovation.

Thoreau's original essay on the subject focused on the moral imperative to ignore unjust laws through noncompliance. That might result in an arrest, or it might not; the important part was noncompliance, and provoking an arrest was simply a necessary evil that might result, not the point of civil disobedience, or something to actively seek.<p>I hadn't thought of Al Capone as an example of civil disobedience, but that's an interesting point, and I'll admit that example does strengthen your point, because he isn't what people usually think of as civil disobedience. There are many more examples than Al Capone of aiming primarily to change the situation directly, rather than mainly aimed at provoking a symbolic arrest, though. Would you consider the Underground Railroad an example of civil disobedience, or of something else?<p>Even in cases where there is a desire to provoke a high-profile, symbolic arrest, widespread flouting to render the law unenforceable is often part of the strategy as well. For example, Gandhi's famous Salt March had two components. On the one hand, Gandhi personally, very publicly and openly, announced his intention to make salt, and began a march to the sea where he'd do so, in a symbolic gesture to violate the British salt laws and provoke arrest. But equally importantly, the Salt March was intended to kick off millions of Indians making their own salt, rendering the law so widely violated that it became completely unenforceable. You (and Kerr) seem to be thinking of the first part of that as the only thing that counts as ""civil disobedience"", but the second part was critically important to the success of the Salt March, and I think it's fair to call it an example of widespread civil disobedience.",1358409872

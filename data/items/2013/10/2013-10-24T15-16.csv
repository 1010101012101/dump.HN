6605965,comment,6605312,6605810,3,0,anon1385,,,"The &quot;hypothetically perfect search&quot; has absolutely zero ads and only shows results based on merit, not how much somebody was willing to pay. Why is that so hard to understand for Google employees? Your founders wrote a bit about this back in the day you know:<p><i>Currently, the predominant business model for commercial search engines is advertising. The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users. For example, in our prototype search engine one of the top results for cellular phone is &quot;The Effect of Cellular Phone Use Upon Driver Attention&quot;, a study which explains in great detail the distractions and risk associated with conversing on a cell phone while driving. This search result came up first because of its high importance as judged by the PageRank algorithm, an approximation of citation importance on the web [Page, 98]. It is clear that a search engine which was taking money for showing cellular phone ads would have difficulty justifying the page that our system returned to its paying advertisers. For this type of reason and historical experience with other media [Bagdikian 83], we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.</i><p><i>Since it is very difficult even for experts to evaluate search engines, search engine bias is particularly insidious. A good example was OpenText, which was reported to be selling companies the right to be listed at the top of the search results for particular queries [Marchiori 97]. This type of bias is much more insidious than advertising, because it is not clear who &quot;deserves&quot; to be there, and who is willing to pay money to be listed. This business model resulted in an uproar, and OpenText has ceased to be a viable search engine. But less blatant bias are likely to be tolerated by the market. For example, a search engine could add a small factor to search results from &quot;friendly&quot; companies, and subtract a factor from results from competitors. This type of bias is very difficult to detect but could still have a significant effect on the market. Furthermore, advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results. For example, we noticed a major search engine would not return a large airlines homepage when the airlines name was given as a query. It so happened that the airline had placed an expensive ad, linked to the query that was its name. A better search engine would not have required this ad, and possibly resulted in the loss of the revenue from the airline to the search engine. In general, it could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want. This of course erodes the advertising supported business model of the existing search engines. However, there will always be money from advertisers who want a customer to switch products, or have something that is genuinely new. But we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.</i><p><a href=""http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html</a>",1382630310

He should be looking at approaches like Geoff Hinton&#x27;s deep belief networks and brain-inspired systems like Jeff Hawkins&#x27;s NuPIC, and comparing and contrasting them with his own theories and findings!  The converse is true too: all those other researchers should be finding ways to collaborate with Hofstadter.

VanillaGrape is a place for &quot;delicious, free card games&quot;.<p>Currently, we have launched our first game, called Memory, and the response has been really positive. We&#x27;ve gotten tons of feedback from our family and friends, and have made changes accordingly, and we continue to improve the game.<p>To play the Memory game, you flip open 2 cards, and if they are same numbered cards, then you score a point, and continue to flip open 2 more cards. If the card numbers are different, then those 2 cards are flipped back, and it is computer&#x27;s turn to flip open 2 cards. Here, if the cards are same numbered, then computer scores a point, and continues to flip open 2 more cards. This way, the game-play goes back and forth between you and computer, and whoever scores the highest points wins the game.<p>Last night, we updated the Memory game, and added 3 modes - &quot;Original-52&quot;, &quot;JAQK-16&quot;, and &quot;Short-26&quot;.<p>Original-52 has 52 cards. JAQK-16 has only 16 cards available - Jack, Ace, Queen, and King of all four suits. In Short-26, the deck is cut in half, so that, instead of two pairs, only a single pair can be made. Meaning, if you pick two queen cards, then there will not be any more queen cards available.<p>We&#x27;re very new, and it would be great if the HN community could please visit and play our game, located at <a href=""http://vanillagrape.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vanillagrape.com</a>.<p>And because we&#x27;re very new, there might be tiny details that we might have missed out, so we&#x27;d like to iron out those things, before continuing on to make more games. The UI has been somewhat of a challenge. So, we&#x27;d love to know if there&#x27;s any issues you find, or if there&#x27;s feedback or comments you&#x27;d like to provide.<p>Also, you can read more about our development on our blog - &quot;Thoughts & Talk & Tech&quot; at <a href=""http://vanillagrape.com/blog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vanillagrape.com/blog</a><p>Thank you!

Of course I&#x27;m probably fairly biased because I&#x27;m a pretty heavy Airbnb user, with more than ten Airbnb stays in NYC in the last couple years.<p>From what I&#x27;ve experienced Airbnb has allowed me to stay in areas of the city that have few hotels or poor hotel coverage. I&#x27;m not the kind of person who enjoys Midtown. I can&#x27;t stand the tourist crowds, most of the restaurants are horrible and there is no way in hell that I&#x27;m going to spend $200 a night of startup money on staying at a Midtown hotel.<p>So when I&#x27;m in NYC with the startup I work for I&#x27;ll stay in Williamsburg at a cheap Airbnb place. Because of this I&#x27;m usually able to stay around three weeks, and during that time my money is going to local restaurants, bars, and convenience stores in Williamsburg and the LES.<p>All considered I probably still spend the same amount of money as your average Midtown tourist, because I stay in NYC much longer even though my expenses per day are lower than if I was staying in corporate hotels. But the important thing is that the money I do spend is going to a local resident (90% of the Airbnbs I&#x27;ve stayed at have been renting a room in the primary residence of the Airbnb host), and to small local businesses, not to big corporate chain hotels and chain restaurants in Midtown.

Essentially, you can turn what would normally be willpower draining conscious decisions into routine habits that don&#x27;t require any. Bad analogy, but you&#x27;re not increasing your MP, you&#x27;re just making it cheaper to cast Cure.<p>Part of this process for me is learning and reinforcing new habits, but I think there&#x27;s also value in building confidence in your ability to form new habits. When you see that you&#x27;re capable of meaningful change, that little jolt of happy chemical rewards serves to reinforce the metahabit of self improvement.",1382627733

These are not all peer reviewed papers, but many of them have data and methodologies and, most importantly, numbers. Read only the abstracts, if you&#x27;re short on time.<p>As always, the topic is so much more nuanced than &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. The first result, &quot;Patent Troll Myths&quot; by Michael Risch is a good start.<p>Sure, you will find the papers by Bessen et al where the &quot;trolls cost the economy 29 Billion&quot; meme comes from. But you&#x27;ll also find a paper (by Schwartz and Kesan) that debunks Bessen&#x27;s paper, which got nearly 0 coverage in the press. You&#x27;ll even find a paper showing trolls have better patents than average! But these tend to get settled quickly, so typically the poorer ones go to trial, and so you get papers (like from Lemley) showing that trolls lose more cases than average.<p>You&#x27;ll also find papers arguing the benefits of trolls, debunking some of the common arguments against trolls, and introducing new previously unconsidered harms of patent trolls.<p>And of course, just like there&#x27;s no clear definition of &quot;software patents&quot;, there is no clear definition of &quot;patent trolls&quot; either, and you&#x27;ll find papers discussing this. <p>And because they use different data sets, different papers look at the same problem at the same time and reach completely opposite conclusions.<p>And further, because the authors are almost never practitioners in the field, you get some really obvious findings being reported... and then misconstrued! For instance there&#x27;s a paper showing litigation has shot up since 2007, and presenting various theories, completely missing the \nMedimmune v Genntech decision that effectively upended the rules of patent licensing. And there&#x27;s the paper that argues patent quality is dropping because more patents were being issued, without being aware of the ending of the misguided &quot;reject, reject, reject&quot; unofficial policy instituted by former USPTO head Jon Dudas (<a href=""http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2009/03/16/prespective-of-an-anonymous-patent-examiner/id=2190"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2009/03/16/prespective-of-an-anony...</a>)<p>And as always, it&#x27;s helpful to keep in mind where the authors&#x27; funding comes from. Bessen of the &quot;29 billion&quot; fame, for instance, is funded by the &quot;Coalition for Patent Fairness&quot;. Check out the list of supporters. It&#x27;s almost ad hom, but hey, if we can point out that studies showing the harms of piracy are often funded by the MPAA, we can point this out too.<p>Yes, there are clear bad actors like Lodsys, but there are so many more variables out there, and many are arguably helping more than harming. <p>Yet, somehow, it&#x27;s only one small side of the story that gets told. <p>As this is a hot-button topic, we should take an objective look at the data. Because, quoting from one of the papers above, &quot;Without a better understanding of the many complicated effects of patents in high technology markets, we run the very real risk of misguided policy decisions.&quot;",1382627342

The feedback we got from our first submission to OSDI was <i>awesome</i>, and helped seriously improve the quality of the research, not just the paper.  (It led us, for example, to adding the formal proof and the machine-checkable proof.)  The NSDI feedback was crappy.  I&#x27;m disappointed, because I like NSDI a lot.  I think people were just having a bad-Paxos day.  The final SOSP feedback was again really good.",1382627067

Second day early-slot speakers joke that no one will turn up anyway, or they’ll all just be staring into their coffee. It has become normal, in fact expected, that drinking and staying out late is what we do while at conferences.</i><p>There are a number of issues here: drinking (to excess), staying out late, and scheduled events early the day after these are known and expected to happen. I would think that drinking is actually the least of them.<p><i>Of course it’s possible to attend these events and not drink, but being the sober person at a party gets tiresome.</i><p>It&#x27;s also possible to drink without ending up drunk, by not drinking too much. Alcohol is metabolized at... I think it&#x27;s around 1h20m/drink or so.<p><i>I attended Monitorama EU recently, where one attendee had proposed a 5K run around the Tiergarten in Berlin on the morning of the second day.</i><p>It sounds like this actually worked, which I find surprising (really, talking while running?). Something to note tho, is that it was a &quot;small group&quot; that did this which sounds even less all-inclusive than leaving out underage participants is.<p><i>Photo or history walks around cities can be attractive to a lot of people in our industry</i><p>Yes.<p><i>These are all good examples of simple things that can be organized around conferences to create alternatives or additions to the parties.</i><p>Something to keep in mind for these is that they&#x27;re <i>outdoors</i>. Which means they&#x27;re subject to weather and to daylight hours. They also involve moving around / doing things in an organized fashion.<p><i>That said, I am still struggling to find good alternatives to the pub meetup, particularly in the UK. Other than taking over the corner of a larger coffee shop for a daytime meet, what kind of things are possible and inexpensive for small groups? In particular I find it hard to organize alternatives for the type of meeting where the numbers that might turn up are hard to predict.</i><p>The thing about coffee shops and pubs is that everyone is in one place with no organized activities to pay attention to. This is the important part, and the drinking only comes in because that&#x27;s what society says to expect when you have a group of people &quot;hanging out&quot; with no agenda in the evening.",1382626977

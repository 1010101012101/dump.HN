5858510,comment,5855851,5858340,1,0,binarycrusader,,,"I&#x27;ll clarify then: I believe Solaris has had the first part (ability to boot into a 32-bit or 64-bit kernel) since 1998.  That&#x27;s well before Apple even provided a 64-bit kernel or ever shipped an OS X release.<p>Solaris has long had a single, unified architecture for 32-bit and 64-bit and until recently delivered both a 32-bit and 64-bit kernel on a single disk.  That&#x27;s why on Solaris you&#x27;ll generally find the 32-bit libraries installed in &#x27;usr/lib&#x27; and the 64-bit under &#x27;usr/lib/64&#x27;.<p>The only exception is for processor architectures (SPARC/x86) where it made less sense.<p>But even then, Solaris 11 has multi-variant packages, so a single package provides support for both x86 and SPARC.<p>It&#x27;s true that (as far as I&#x27;m aware) Solaris never supported the 64-bit application on 32-bit kernel hack that OS X did (which comes with significant performance tradeoffs).<p>So at most, Apple can claim that achievement, but they can&#x27;t claim to be the first to provide a single install image supporting 32-bit and 64-bit.",1370908785

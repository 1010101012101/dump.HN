There are no guarantees.<p>So, I agree with you that Louis CK's marketing is fantastic. But it's not like only one person can market themselves this way, and there's not just a single audience that will pay for good stuff distributed in a civilized way.

3351275,comment,3349670,3351228,5,0,chc,,,"There are real semantic differences in CoffeeScript. As listed by jashkenas himself more than a year ago in response to the same accusation:<p>Leaving features off the table and just talking about semantic cleanups, here's a few:<p>* Switch statement doesn't fall-through by default.<p>* Variables don't need to be declared with ""var"", and can't ever become global accidentally.<p>* Equality is strict, using `===`, if you want coercive equality, you coerce the object yourself.<p>* Loops that are used to generate functions close over their index variables, so that all inner functions don't share the final value of the index. This is the same problem that ECMAScript Harmony introduces ""let"" to solve.<p>* Splats largely replace use of the ""arguments"" object, so you don't get bit by ""arguments"" only being a faux-array.<p>* Comparisons can be chained, as in Python -- so you can write: ""100 > x > 25"", and have the answer be correct.<p>* Multiline strings are valid without having to escape the newline.<p>* And the big one: everything in CoffeeScript is an expression. Without having to use temporary variables, you can return the result of an if/else from a function, pass a comprehension (loop) directly into a function call, assign the result of a try/catch, and so on.<p>(<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1697586"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1697586</a>)",1323856512

3351249,comment,3348671,3349035,4,0,justaname,,,"I wish I could see marriage this way. After being with my girlfriend for almost 7 years, we married. Turns out, a few days before the wedding she started an affair with the leader of her theatre group, whom she invited with the group to our wedding apero, to play some theatre plays for us. Two months later, she spilled the beans, and so much shit has happened since, that I can't look at a couple without thinking which one is cheating the other or if they are cheating their partners together. Living in a country where there is no apparent social consequence for adultery has pushed me to the point where I don't want anything to do with what marriage or relationships represent. I left the country I grew up in to come here for this girl, and I'll be leaving without getting the divorce most people would want. I can't face it, and don't give a rat's ass about all of that anymore. Just getting my life back, and finding some inner peace again is all that matters.<p>I've also left suicide as an option open, but I've got one plan ahead of that which is just to stand up and walk away, loose ends untied.<p>My point is, the meaning that most people take for granted from an intimate relationship with someone, for me personally, has died. I'm no longer willing to sacrifice so much for someone else, because it took so much from everyday since. The trauma steals your life because your mind simply isn't capable of thinking of anything else anymore.<p>The conflict of loving someone and at the same time hating that part of them that destroyed you, is a paradox that makes it impossible to be blind to the reality that you can no longer trust anyone with your life.<p>I'll be glad to get out of this heartless country and back into the sunshine, where people have the balls to speak their mind and call a bastard a bastard, and a bitch a bitch.",1323855936

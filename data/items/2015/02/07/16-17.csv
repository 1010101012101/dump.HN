9014520,comment,9014125,9014125,0,0,jofer,,,"One of the things I found interesting about Iceland is that, at least when I was doing fieldwork there (~12 years ago), beef was outrageously expensive, but lamb and salmon were relatively cheap.  We &quot;had&quot; to eat a lot of lamb and salmon to keep costs down.<p>For that reason, a lot of restaurants with burgers on the menu served ground lamb instead of ground beef.  Lambburgers are tasty!<p>At the time, I worked at a McDonald&#x27;s back home.  I had no intention of eating at one abroad, but I was curious to see what an Icelandic McDonald&#x27;s would look like.  I went to one somewhere in/near Keflavik shortly after we arrived, and while the menu looked more or less the same, a regular cheesburger was the equivalent of ~$10. (Not the meal, or a quarter pounder, just a cheesburger.)  At the time, I was completely flabbergasted.<p>I&#x27;d wager a significant portion of the reason that all McDonald&#x27;s closed in Iceland is simply cost.  Beef is more-or-less entirely imported, and is therefore very expensive.  Lamb is cheaper and tastier. McDonald&#x27;s uses all beef (and bad beef, at that), and just can&#x27;t compete with local short-order restaurants.<p>Keep in mind that this was in 2002-2003, well before the recent economic troubles in Iceland.  It was also the first time I&#x27;d ever been outside the US. Everything seemed outrageously expensive to me, partly just because I was living in one of the cheapest cities in the US (my share of the rent was $80/month) and was getting by on ~$300/month.<p>Also, Iceland has _incredible_ hot dogs, weirdly enough... Natural casing, better meat (lamb, maybe?), and they&#x27;re nicely seasoned.  They&#x27;re just plain good.  We used to cook them in an aluminum foil packet with onions over the fire, and then sear them a touch over the flames after the onions were cooked.  I&#x27;ll never look at hot dogs the same way again!",1423328391

I&#x27;ve begun taking a perverse pleasure in learning which of my posts/comments will get downvoted.<p>(Generally, anything criticizing HN darlings, e.g., Uber, will get downvoted. The echo chamber is strong.)<p>I suspect you got downvoted because of a petulant realization of the inherent contradiction that many of us realize: This article really does not fit the HN guidelines at all yet we find it so intriguing.<p>I believe the reasons we find it so intriguing are pretty obvious: We all of us, we hackers, love the exceptional, the one-of-its-kind, the historically significant if sufficiently curious, etc. We hack because the <i>status quo</i> isn&#x27;t good enough.<p>Getting that into a guideline is a bit tougher.<p>I suspect I&#x27;ll get downvoted because I just labelled the echo chamber as petulant.

9014518,comment,9013261,9013261,0,0,chernevik,,,"&quot;The only threat a lot of us incumbents face is in the primaries, where someone even more extreme than we are can turn out the vote among an even smaller, more self-selected group of partisans.&quot;<p>From this the rest follows.  Lobbying is a sweet gig because Congress is stabilized to a predictability sufficient to justify organizational investment.  Congress is &#x27;parliamentarized&#x27; because the national parties are organized around their constituent interest groups.  Etc.<p>This certainly wasn&#x27;t what the Founders hoped for.  And party organization and factionalism have been the most malign factors in American history.  If you think it&#x27;s bad now, just thank God you aren&#x27;t in the middle of a Civil War.  Factionalism poisoned the Constitution even before it got started, by forcing into the document an unprincipled carve-out for slavery and a logically absurd and emotionally nauseating 3/5 &quot;representation&quot; for slaves.<p>And what&#x27;s to be done about it?<p>The Founders were insanely smart political people, and it&#x27;s a good rule of thumb that if they didn&#x27;t have a constitutional answer for a political problem, there is no such answer.  This guess is fortified by the failure of Abraham Lincoln, the greatest de-bugger in human history, to solve the problem.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible to solve factionalism by some constitutional / legal hack, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.<p>I think our only hope is _culture_.  Our ability, as citizens, to recognize our own individual partisanships and check them.  And to recognize them in our fellow citizens and resist them.  We have to recognize that in our current political system, real power doesn&#x27;t lie in Congress, or the Presidency, but in whatever people and forces are shaping the ideologies around which these parties are organized.  We have got to identify those forces and examine their motives and prepare to break with them when they aren&#x27;t serving their stated goals.  For all power in all places is corruptible.  We have got to start paying attention to the use of language, not to understand problems, but as a tool for political organization.  We have to start recognizing the political and organizational dangers of those ideas and dreams we hold dearest, and find ways to guard against those dangers.<p>tldr;\nIt is ultimately our government.  Its flaws ultimately proceed from us.",1423328355

I watch people do startup-like hours in the sluggish old enterprises that baffle startup folks. Concentration of money and experience? <i>That</i> matters.<p>Think about the utility function of hours worked. What&#x27;s the relative productivity of the 50th hour of work this week, compared to the 10th? At what point does exhaustion and overfocus actually <i>hurt</i> rather than help productivity? It may be earlier than you think. If I&#x27;m only 20% as productive on the least pleasant working hours, why am I even doing that to myself and the people who love me?<p>Work is a marathon, not a sprint. If you sprint in the middle of a marathon, you&#x27;ll get a slower time overall, because you&#x27;re draining too much energy. Likewise, an all-nighter or two of coding will hurt you for days afterward.<p>Work smarter, not harder. People who brag about how smart they are should understand this.",1423328282

The recruiter is trying to get me a job, just like a car salesman is trying to get a car a driver. Of course, there are good recruiters (and good car salesmen) that are truly interested in finding the best match for both parties, but at the core of the relationship the employer is the one paying the finder&#x27;s fee.<p>That being said, the best recruiters take the long view, and realize that their career depends on maintaining relationships and growing their reputation. If they become known as someone who simply puts butts in chairs, they won&#x27;t get very far. However, if they develop a reputation as someone who really is looking out for everyone&#x27;s interests, their words will carry more weight with their customers, and they&#x27;ll have the best product to sell.",1423328206

9014502,comment,9014020,9014020,0,0,jstoiko,,,"I feel like some people have built this fantasy that working at startups is like vacations.<p>These people probably work their ass off during their 40, 60, or maybe 80 hrs on the job. So they dont understand when they ear that startups&#x27; work schedule is more relax because they cannot relate to it. However, when they leave their desk, it&#x27;s over, they&#x27;re up to something else and they probably even force themselves not to think about work anymore.<p>Startups take a relaxing approach to work hours because the (right) person who works there lives and breathes startup 24/7.<p>It&#x27;s easy to say when you&#x27;re a founder (disclaimer: I am one). But it is something I have witnessed in (good) startup employees as well. They think about it all the time.<p>@falcolas is right, who the hell cares how many hours in the week you spent executing your tasks?

9014501,comment,9011051,9011051,0,0,subpixel,,,"One thing that has gone unmentioned: when you run flash sales that promote other retailers&#x27; products, you&#x27;re strengthening your competitors&#x27; business as much as your own.<p>For example, it was very common to see discounted jewelry or apparel on Fab from brands with a much deeper collection on their own site. It&#x27;s 2011-2014, of course I&#x27;m going to Google the designer or brand, find their own site, and make an informed decision about what to buy.<p>Designers know this, and are savvy enough to use other channels to promote their own, where they charge the sort of prices they can build a business on. I&#x27;m willing to bet that Fab made quite a few designers more money via these sort of implicit referrals than via discounted flash sales.<p>Hindsight being 20/20, if Fab wanted to build a billion dollar business, they should have bought an e-commerce startup, not other retail operations. That&#x27;s the only way they could have captured more of the value they were creating. Say they managed to buy Shopify. A, they&#x27;d be swimming in revenue. B, Shopify would have the marketplace they failed to make work on their own.",1423328179

If you put in 80 hours per week and your competition puts in 60, you&#x27;ll win because you&#x27;ll learn more quickly than your competition.  But I don&#x27;t think that accounts for efficiency.

Sounds like fun actually, but it&#x27;s a different animal from full-stack development. Most of the successful freelancers I&#x27;ve met focus on a particular technology. E.g. Mongo contracts out experts in their database, some people specialize in search technology, others do HBase. Nobody does all of those things at the same time.",1423325538

Anything that can compute primitive recursive functions is as powerful as anything else (though not requiring the same time and space resources).<p>If you mean expressive power, then you seem to be saying that &quot;the most expressively powerful language I have ever seen takes away my ability to focus on the problem, and spend my brain power remembering what is on the stack where&quot;.<p>Even decently well-structured assembly language doesn&#x27;t have this problem!

How have people done databases in the last 50 years? 40? 30? 20? 10? now? (while that seems like a lot of research, it&#x27;s generally not - as much as some things change, a lot have not changed for a long time in CS). What are the big theories that propel most of the solutions?

RethinkDB/Mongo & Neo4J?<p>I generally find that knowing stuff in those frames is more than enough. Personally, this approach works but I am embarrassed when I have to look up things like &quot;how to list all the tables in mysql&quot; on Google, but I&#x27;m starting to think that&#x27;s not such a big deal. Yes, I don&#x27;t know every oracle/microsoft/mysql/postgres command, but I think it would be more ridiculous to take the time to try hard to memorize stuff like that, and then completely miss out on the benefits of NoSQL databases, for example.<p>Also -- do tons of side projects.",1423325337

I thought things like OpenCL would have made multi core CPU less relevant for intensive calculations, since GPUs are so much more powerful when you need to execute tasks at the same time.<p>And since processors were single threaded for a very long time, I was wondering what were threads being used for before multi core CPUs, and how did it really change things for GUIs. I mean threads were not really useful on single cores, were they ?<p>So it just seems to me that threads are just being made useful since multi cores CPUs, not really before. And unless you really need to take full advantage of the CPU when you&#x27;re making a single app, your app is not always the single one being ran, cores can also run other apps not being threads. One simple software might not always need to take advantage of threads, unless it&#x27;s a big software like a commercial 3d game.",1423325091

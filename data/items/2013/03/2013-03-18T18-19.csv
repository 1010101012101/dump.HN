Lately I've become worried about my lack of organization and how it has affected my long term plans. After reading Stefan's post yesterday[1], I decided to end this source of anxiety and design something that suits my needs better than current project management software does, and maybe solves someone else's problems.<p>I'm specially frustrated by the fact that most of these apps, when they're not glorified to-do lists, are focused on collaboration. I mostly work alone, and it's keeping track of my own work, not my interactions with other people, that frustrates me the most.<p>I dislike to do lists because they always seem to require me to know exactly what to dobut most of the time I don't know what I have to do.

It also wouldn't be spam for you to post a note to the bug about removing the cache options to point at the quota bug, and to make sure it'll stick around as an about:config option.  However, canvassing for other people to go post to a bugzilla tracking bug just leads to noise like the current pile of comments in bug 851698; the vast majority of the comments in that bug, especially the ones by users labeled ""(New to Bugzilla)"", do indeed constitute spam, and those same comments show up in just about every bug trying to clean up the UI.<p>See also <a href=""https://www.xkcd.com/1172/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.xkcd.com/1172/</a> .<p>> Not possible - the quota information is not made available in any standard way, but rather by a non-standard dot file in the user's home directory. I know the quota information should be exported by rquotad but things aren't always that neat in the real world.<p>So, we've started from ""bug only seen by people running Firefox over NFS"", already a very small fraction of users, and then shrunk the audience further to people who don't even use the standard quota mechanisms.  An option to serve that vanishingly small fraction of users seems like precisely the domain of about:config.<p>> Even if it were possible users may still prefer not to sacrifice any of their quota-limited home directory to Firefox cache.<p>And those users can go tweak the setting in about:config, or you could tweak it for them by changing the system-wide default.  That doesn't make it appropriate to put in the main configuration UI; not enough people use it, and its very existence in the UI hurts more people than it helps.<p>> Who's Mozilla to presume they know what users want?<p>Makers of a browser used by hundreds of millions of users, with extensive data from actual user testing, tons of statistical data telling them which settings and UI options people actually touch, and most importantly an understanding that just because an option has users doesn't mean it should continue to exist, and that the noisiest people on Bugzilla frequently don't represent a significant fraction of users.<p>about:config <i>exists</i> to satisfy use cases like yours.  Tone down the rhetoric and understand that when your software has hundreds of millions of users, every single change represents a tradeoff between who it might help and who it might hurt.  This one seems far easier than most.",1363632854
5396334,comment,5390218,5395601,1,0,jfim,,,"> If only Heroku allowed dynos to stop accepting further requests rather than queuing at the dyno level!<p>It does and it's in the configuration for your app, not on the Heroku side of things. For example, if you're using Unicorn, check the documentation for :backlog, which controls the connection queue depth of the web server.[1]<p>> I don't see how forking is insufficient concurrency for the cases you mention, either. Even the Ruby GIL will allow threads to switch while blocking on I/O, so your ten second DB query is covered.<p>Can it handle 10, 20 or 100 long database connections/web service queries? I do admit I don't know much about Ruby threading and per-thread overheads and in that particular case, green threads are perfectly fine.<p>> But there's no free lunch--if 2000ms of CPU ends up on one of your servers, and your median request is closer to 100ms, the unlucky server that gets the 2000ms request is still a little fucked without any mechanism to counterbalance. Even letting the server stop accepting new requests from the LB, as you suggested, would be sufficient.<p>There shouldn't be any requests that take that much CPU time, unless you're doing something ridiculous like sorting millions of integers or whatnot. If your application requires sorting millions of integers or any computationally expensive requests, for some reason, those should be handled in a backend queue and sent to the client using long polling/comet/websockets/meta refresh so that your front end can worry about delivering pages quickly and shoveling data between the backend and the client instead of crunching numbers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://unicorn.bogomips.org/Unicorn/Configurator.html#method-i-listen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unicorn.bogomips.org/Unicorn/Configurator.html#method...</a>",1363632853

First, thanks for your considered response.<p>I'd like to point out, respectfully, that appeal to nature, or to evolutionary ""purpose,"" is (especially vis. ethics) an argumentative fallacy (social Darwinism, anyone?). Animals (and, historically, humans) also rape each other. Some get mad and kill each other. So what?

There are people around this world and on this site who haven personal experience dealing with Mr. Arrington and/or have followed his antics for years.  He's stirred up a bunch of unecessary drama, some much like has been brought against him.  Remember his backroom VC deals series?  Or accusing Leo Laporte of giving the Pre a positive report as a favour?  That's real karma.  I assume that some of the people who have upvoted my comment have, like myself, determined him to be someone I refuse to be bothered with.  Certainly not bothered enough to feel sorry for him when accused of impropriety.  He was a pretty good tech blogger who used his influence and money to become a VC.  I see no reason to respect his work in the latter, especially when it can be tied to a possible conflict of interest.<p>Understand the context of my comment: that we should be forbidden from ""insulting"" these people or companies.  By suggesting there is some conflict of interest between their investment fund and companies that they cover?  I whole-heartedly disagree with that.  I think the way this is heading, with tech influencers, journalists and VC's intermingling, is <i>bad</i>.  I guess that isn't as easy to agree with when you are a tech influencer, journalist or VC, or rely on one of these people.  Luckily, I'm not and don't.<p>As far as MG, information on his talents needs be nothing more than a perusal of his Techcrunch work.  Judge for yourself.  If this is the baseline for ""good"" tech writing, then the business is in a world of hurt.  Writing over and over about the same few companies with shoddy analysis doesn't cut it for me.  And if you read the comments that follow nearly every one of his old Techcrunch articles, you'd see I'm not alone, by any means.  I guess not being able to say he sucks goes hand-in-hand with giving everyone a trophy at sporting events.<p>The low of the state of the forums will be when we aren't allowed to speak our minds because we're edited out by the tech powers-that-be-- the Arringtons, the Sarah Lacey's-- and all the sites are not real journalism, but VC mouthpieces.

It monkey patches the standard library and messes with CPython internals to achieve what it does, infinitely increasing the chance it will conflict with some other piece of code (for example, that bizarre ancient internal propriety library you're using that started life in Fortran, etc)<p>In the case of async I'm glad to see a from scratch implementation for the standard library. It's a weird area that necessitates some constructions that there is no really standard Python style for. You only need to look at Twisted and e.g. its method chaining to realize this stuff would need a thorough sanity rework before it ever became standard anyway.<p>Also, most other implementations take the approach of building their own little world.

This was written by the same people, and they're all really good programmers, so the obvious confounding variables are not an issue here. Eventlet and Gevent are just so much better.<p>Worried about monkey-patching? Then only monkey-patch the parts you need to be asynchronous. Worried about magic that you don't understand? Have a look at the code; the magic is actually pretty straightforward after you've paid a little attention to the man behind the curtain.<p>If you're interested in async stuff for Python, I urge you to have a look at Eventlet or Gevent.",1363632136

""What do they even do?"" people ask, given we roll in at 11am and don't ever seem to fix any of the things that are broken for them.<p>Of course we are always saying ""no"" to every passing request - last thing we need is scope creep and to take on more tasks than we can reasonably accomplish. Of course <i>we</i> think we're busy, and we are, but we can't satisfy everyone. There is tons of appeal in just buying some software to ""get the job done.""<p>And we are so averse to buying third-party Enterprise Software Packages because they're, uh, bad, or something. Expensive. They integrate with Excel, and we <i>hate</i> Excel. We can do the same thing ourselves, obviously, but more quickly. Who needs an accounting software anyway, how hard could it be?<p>Often they are bad. Netsuite integration is awful, Salesforce integration is awful, and even startups who should theoretically have a superior product end up being awful (for example, last I checked, OrderGroove - which claims to take the pain out of subscription services - is not PCI even compliant, so they can't meaningfully handle billing issues.)<p>On the one hand, I want to applaud this - if you need something done, go buy something to accomplish the task and don't worry about your persnickety developers.<p>On the other hand, devs are often the ones who have to maintain and integrate with a half-baked piece of software and are never consulted to evaluate how viable that software will be to solve the problem at hand.

Everyone on earth spoke the same language. As people migrated from the east, they settled in the land of Shinar. People there sought to make bricks and build a city and a tower with its top in the sky, to make a name for themselves, so that they not be scattered over the world. God came down to look at the city and tower, and remarked that as one people with one language, nothing that they sought would be out of their reach. God went down and confounded their speech, so that they could not understand each other, and scattered them over the face of the earth, and they stopped building the city.

I don't think that functionality that the browser handles should be moved from the browser's own options panel to addons, third-party or otherwise. Even if Mozilla themselves offered addons to manage enabling/disabling JavaScript, SSL, certificate management, etc., that gives the impression that they somehow believe that the functionality being moved over to addons is secondary, unimportant, or less of a priority than more simple options which I think is just not true.<p>I'm totally on board with the idea that if less than 2% of users need functionality it shouldn't be placed front and center and maybe it doesn't need to be in the options panel at all but most of his examples aren't the sort of thing I would want removed or outsourced to an addon whether I was a technical user or not.<p>I think the real answer is to prioritize, organize, and simplify. Make the most important, general, and broad options the first ones a user sees. Organize them from most general to more specific (which probably includes an increasing level of complexity as well). Go ahead and hide some of the more fine-grained controls in a panel somewhere that all but those who really know what they're looking for will find it (but make sure to document it, too). Finally, remove anything that simply doesn't need to be there. Those things, I believe, will be very few and far between. The author makes it sound like there are tons of options they could get away with just cutting from the options without anyone noticing but I'm not convinced. Despite the fact that some options are very rarely used, when that rare case of them actually being needed comes up having them available, albeit in some hidden away panel, can make all the difference between a happy and a frustrated user - a user who won't have to go out and search for yet another addon to manage something they thought the browser itself should be able to control.<p>The solution isn't to reduce the number of options, at least not in the way the author promotes. Instead I think it's really just about better organizing and presenting what's already there. Mozilla is all about freedom and their customizability is something a large segment of their userbase loves them for. Why ruin that?",1363630754

I'll take not knowing if my green threads switch tasks and add another green thread lock, instead of doubling my code size with yields, callbacks and futures.<p>Let's talk about Twisted (sorry couldn't resist WAT video reference). I remember for years searching for parallel libraries to parse exotic protocols. Regular Python library is there, but no, can't use that, sorry. Gotta go find or write one that returns Deferreds. You add a single Twisted module in your code, good luck! -- it ripples all the way to the top through your API and you are doomed being locked into the Twisted world forever.<p>When gevent and eventlet came around it was like a breath of fresh air. This is what sane concurrent IO looks like in Python:<p><a href=""http://eventlet.net/doc/examples.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eventlet.net/doc/examples.html</a><p>My fear is that many will just say fuck it, I'll just use Go/Rust/Erlang for IO bound concurrent problems.<p>It is nice having a benevolent dictator, except when he goes a little crazy, then dictatorship doesn't sounds so much fun anymore.",1363630652

Absolutely no doubt, and there was an 8-1 Supreme Court decision just this decade, post-9/11, that reaffirmed this principle. Habeas is the bedrock of our civil liberties and we should guard it jealously.<p>But habeas is a procedure for challenging illegal <i>detention</i>, meanwhile Al Awalki was a fugitive. He was not in the hands of U.S. authorities, on U.S. soil. He took up arms against America in Yemen, and was hiding, evading capture. Habeas is inapplicable to a person who is evading the government's attempts to bring him to justice, in effect evading the government's attempts to give him due process. It is inapplicable by the very nature of the device--a writ from a court to order the release of a prisoner being held by an executive authority within the court's jurisdiction. No U.S. court had jurisdiction over Al Awalki.",1363630616

Users expect to be able to type in something similar to how they would describe a product to a store clerk (e.g. ""I need a pink, impact resistant iphone 5 cover.""). But search fields don't understand language patterns or sentence meaning. Search fields work off key words, ranked by priority. These key words match item titles, descriptions, tags, categories, etc.  It also isn't capable of doing word substitution, so it may not know you meant ""case"" instead of ""cover"". So if ""cover"" doesn't appear in the title or description, the search won't rank it that highly (if it's a ""case"").<p>In this case, putting the query as something like ""iPhone 5 case pink"" would have probably returned results that were more aligned with what the user was looking for, but most people aren't going to think that way.<p>When you understand how a search input actually works - text input, query statements, database structures, ranking algorithms, etc. - you think about searches in a completely different way.

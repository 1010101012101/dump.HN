Especially here, because jurisdiction shopping seems uniquely available to the wealthy.<p>I take the author&#x27;s point that not everyone caught up in this is actively trying to evade taxes, but I&#x27;m also not especially saddened by paperwork hardship stories, nor am I moved by taxes on income after the first ~ $100,000 a year.<p>I&#x27;d find the arguments for change far more persuasive if they were accompanied by compelling suggestions on how to prevent tax fraud from people who can afford to buy a house abroad and spend X days a year in it.<p>I&#x27;m serious, I&#x27;m in your corner 100% if you just meet me half way, acknowledge these laws have some purpose.

In terms of committed costs, MOOCs for the most part are more like textbooks than traditional college classes, even on an a-la-carte menu as one might have available through a community college or extension program. The cash cost is fairly low, the effort expended in enrolling is low, and the time/effort cost is just the time and effort expended directly in online course activities, not driving to a fixed class location at a fixed time that forces giving up other activities with time conflicts (you still have to give up other activities, but you are more flexible as to which ones), etc.<p>So they are cheap to experiment with and don&#x27;t have a lot of sunk costs that people feel they need to justify that stops people from abandoning them if once they get in they expectations aren&#x27;t met, circumstances change, etc.<p>So there&#x27;s a lot lower risk, and people can try a <i>lot</i> more to find what they are looking for. I&#x27;ve finished maybe a third to a half of the MOOCs I&#x27;ve enrolled in, and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t do that with college classes -- but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;m less well served with MOOCs -- the cost of college classes is high enough that I wouldn&#x27;t <i>take</i> most of the MOOCs I&#x27;ve <i>completed</i> -- much less all those I&#x27;ve taken and often still gotten something out of without completing -- as traditional classes, because the risk of something with a higher priority in my life changing so I couldn&#x27;t complete them, combined with the cost that goes into a traditional college class, would be too high.",1418085320

That seems very unlikely in any place where white people are a racial majority and also control all institutions of social or political power.<p>It could also be that focusing on such things leads to the death of communities in rural Maine.<p>But what do we care about more: creating a world where black youth are not gunned down by police officers on a literally daily basis for either absurdly petty crimes or literally no reason (like Oscar Grant, for example), or preserving rural Maine?<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t care at all if rural communities die. I&#x27;m living in a rural &quot;community&quot; in New England myself right now, and it&#x27;s honestly torturous. I&#x27;m glad people are moving to Portland or Boston to raise their children because, frankly, it seems abusive raising a child in this environment. There&#x27;s no Uber, basically no other apps, very few amusements, and virtually zero culture beyond what the majority in the area (old white people) prefer. The lack of competition in general means that there are very few new things, and lots of old, crappy things. Raising children in this area deprives them of stimulation that will literally mean their brains are less dense and less able to fluidly adapt to new situations.<p>I doubt very much that rural Maine, like my own area, has very much diversity in terms of any of the other factors you&#x27;ve listed (I exclude the MBTI because each MBTI axis is effectively randomly distributed, because the test is based on Jungian psuedoscience that means it has no correlation to the real world -- all areas are diverse in MBTI because all areas are diverse to a random discriminator variable). It is not a bad thing for these areas to die. In the near future, I can easily see the area I&#x27;m in dying off as well, and it&#x27;ll be great for all the people who don&#x27;t have to live here anymore.",1418084440

I know it&#x27;s disappointing to hear, and I assure you everyone has made that mistake themselves -- myself included.<p>Big companies do a lot of outbound R&D -- conversations, PoC&#x27;s (proof of concepts), and so on. Sometimes these conversations are a 30 minute call. Sometimes they&#x27;re a series of meetings. Sometimes they even try your product. In almost all cases, when they become serious about trying your product (e.g. outside of a sandbox), they&#x27;ll want a legal agreement.<p>NDAs don&#x27;t count here, they&#x27;re generally vanilla.<p>What they&#x27;ll want is a trial agreement (sometimes called a Pilot Agreement, Software Evaluation Agreement, and so on). This agreement will almost certainly protect them more than it will protect you, but it can be negotiated. They&#x27;re quite easy to generate, particularly for larger Fortune 500 companies that generally have entire procurement departments dedicated to this process. The agreement will cover your IP, situations where you might infringe on IP, general indemnification, and so on. Sometimes the procurement guys really won&#x27;t want to negotiate it -- their job is to protect the interest of the company, and they almost act adversarial to the person trying to bring you into the company as a &quot;check-and-balance&quot; since the person bringing you in may have already fallen in love. In those cases the person requesting the evaluation can sometimes apply pressure as well.<p>So, when a VP at a large Fortune 500 company tells you they won&#x27;t do a trial agreement with you, or won&#x27;t be bothered to discuss it at all, it largely tells you that they&#x27;re just not that interested in it. We&#x27;ve dealt with companies where even a non-manager can generate software evals.<p>There IS one caveat here: They haven&#x27;t seen/tried/etc. your product. If you&#x27;re over-protecting by, for example, expecting them to sign an NDA or a software eval agreement without them first seeing a demo/trial, it&#x27;s quite likely they&#x27;ll usually just turn away.

Like, they make a big deal of the idea that if you have a fairly high level of &quot;shapism&quot; and thus get a fairly segregated society, and then you lower the level of &quot;shapsim,&quot; nothing changes unless you actively reverse your bias and move if your neighborhood is not diverse enough.<p>But clearly people don&#x27;t only ever move for diversity reasons.  Sometimes you move because you got a job or a SO that&#x27;s far away.  Sometimes you move because you can afford more or less living space.  Sometimes you move because you have a child now and want to get into a good school zone.  Or whatever.  And if your preferences are now, compared to when you last moved, more tolerant, that WILL reduce the level of segregation of your society.<p>In fact, people probably move for economic or family reasons far MORE often than they move for diversity reasons.<p>I mean, that&#x27;s not a small difference from their model.  It&#x27;s one of their major points!  That, once segregated, societies won&#x27;t become less segregated unless people actively work on it.<p>And, honestly, I don&#x27;t think that the model holds at all unless you understand that people probably mostly use economic proxies for race over primarily making decisions based on race.  For the most part, I don&#x27;t think people are saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to move there, there&#x27;s too many black people.&quot;  They&#x27;re saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to move there, it&#x27;s too poor or too crime-ridden&quot; or whatever.  And yes, they may be exaggerating the extent to which it is poor or crime-ridden because they have internalized racist ideas about whether majority-black neighborhoods are poor or crime-ridden.  But the point is, you can&#x27;t really address this segregation by telling people to prefer mixed neighborhoods: you need to address the complex relationships of economics and race and how economic class affects neighborhoods and whatever.",1418084183

In fact, right now I can remember at least 2 courses which are extremely hight in my personal &quot;amount of practical knowledge gained from it&quot; toplist, for which I completed exactly zero homeworks and never even watched video on the coursera, because it was easier for me to get it from torrents. For courses with programming it often is downloading assignments, but never submitting them. Why? For various reasons. Sometimes I want to try to do something in other language than suggested one. Sometimes I can think of something more interesting or practical or challenging to do, based on topic I just learned. And if it is the case it actually means I just gained much <i>more</i> from the material than if the best I could do would be just completing what is expected from me. Sometimes, of course, it&#x27;s the opposite: the material is to easy or just silly for I would care completing assignments or even watching all the videos. And, yes, sometimes (rarely, though) the homework seems to be too hard and time consuming than I&#x27;m ready to be doing. Sometimes all I do on the course is using forums, sometimes I never even open the forums once. Sometimes all I get from the course is accidentally getting myself interested in some another topic, very slightly related to the course itself, and I&#x27;ll be investigating on this topic reading various stuff for a very long time after that. In short, I never even tried to be &quot;completing courses&quot; on MOOC, I just tried to learn what I&#x27;m interested in <i>maybe</i> using the course material, maybe not, doing things on my own pace, deciding what I should spend time on by myself, and my observable online behavior hardly tells anything about how much I actually invested in learning something.<p>So this attitude of &quot;You see these low completion rates?! Not like in <i>real</i> universities at all!&quot; is just silly.

I hope software management gets less comfortable with these answers and put their money toward real sustainability such that we see the commercial sides of FOSS projects grow in quality and quantity, with sustainable business models around sponsored features, bug bounties, support engagement, etc. and no need to stoop to licensing the software itself for money (neither restrictively free/commercial dual licenses or enterprise/community feature splits).",1418083440

8720074,comment,8718776,8719729,0,0,emp,,,"Java/Swing is slow is a myth due to badly written applications. Jetbrains does it right. My main machine is a little 11&quot; MacBook and I use AppCode/IntelliJ all day long without performance issues. I use XCode for Interface Builder as the code crafting abilities of the editor are primitive in comparison.   \nI do agree that everything integrates nicely, and it&#x27;s great to just jump in as a newbie, but I miss solid refactoring, code navigation, smart template and multiple cursors the most when I occasionally use it. I can see the evidence when I start on an existing codebase - typo&#x27;s, misnamed methods that have evolved to something else etc. Things that AppCode does trivially, and with full trust are things that XCode users seem to balk at as one never knows if the build will break. Maybe things have improved over time (I&#x27;ve used AppCode for 2+ years now), but the evidence in existing code tells me otherwise.",1418083235

This is also a problem with Eclipse over the IntelliJ toolchain, in general.<p>Eclipse has it&#x27;s own compiler and it uses that to build from within the IDE. Since this is not using Javac, it means that you might and very likely will not have equivalent binaries. Not specific to Android, but this also meant that when a new version of Java is released, IntelliJ can immediately take advantage, but you will be stuck waiting on Eclipse (and NetBeans).<p>Personally, I prefer the IntrlliJ approach since the IDE, javac on my workstation, and javac on the build server can output identical binaries, I trust the results even more so.",1418083217

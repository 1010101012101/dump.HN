That's the great thing in this area of science: Everybody proofs everything all the time. No one's wiser.<p>> To take it to the extreme, there were no fat people in Auschwitz. That is not to say that it was good in any way and that people should starve, but just that it is not impossible to be normal for anyone, you just have to try.<p>So, you state that one can be lean by being forcefully starved (Auschwitz), then state that you don't think this is a good idea and then state ""but it is not impossible to be normal for anyone"" - well: You didn't provide an example for ""normal"". This people in Auschwitz were starving. Food-related diseases (and all other diseases) were on an all-time high. People were dying all the time. This is not an example of ""normal"", this is an example that the human body is able to withstand <i>many, many forms of abuse until it breaks</i>.<p>You would help this discussion if you were able to provide examples of big groups of obese people (there are always outliers) which were able to get lean without starving (starving is really, really bad for your body). Thanks.<p>edit: I've missed the part about Vietnam/Africa before. If you didn't see any fat people in Vietnam then you probably didn't look hard enough. I was there and I've seen them. Africa: Documentaries on Africa usually focus on the really poor parts of Africa. People starve there too, so: See above. (Also: There is the case of hunger obesity where you get really obese <i>because</i> or starvation. Try Google, but beware of shocking results)",1332154731

All I can say is, all the OO languages I've spent any time programming do indeed let you do that, and I'm sorry for you if your experience is otherwise.<p>So clearly I agree that adding primitives is an extremely important ability.  But it's already nearly if not completely there in all the OO languages I use, using classes.<p>I don't think primitives are enough, though. The interface / implementations of interfaces combination is also essential to my programming.  Being able to say ""Curve"" and have it mean Straight or NURBS curve or Circle or Offset curve or Composite curve or... is another huge simplifying device.  In fact, I've just looked at my code, and I have 15 distinct curve types, at least 5 of which I'd have missed if you asked me to list them, despite having written all of them over the years.  That is exactly the power of simplifying abstraction.<p>Let me point out that given a sufficiently capable OO language, this doesn't need inheritance to implement.

Unfortunately, you haven't looked into how Go solves those problems, primarily through its interfaces and type embedding, plus its slices and so on are already generic.<p>It's true they aren't sure if they need it or not, but you clearly haven't looked into many feel they are unnecessary and that the present language is more than sufficient for solving many needs.

Could be solution, even if you have to work out the details of such a scheme. What makes this different from any system we have today is, that people not working are most likely not stigmatised anymore. Currently you have condition attached to recieving money from the state, so as soon as you can get away from these conditions you will. Meaning you need a job , a.k.a. employment. The result is, that everybody without a job has nothing to offer to an emplyeer. Hence, the stigma that he's worthless. But he isn't, maybe he only has talents nobody is willing to pay enough to make a living these days. \nIf this really is a solution or how we can get there, well no idea. But we should think about it. As soon as there's enough for everyone, why not letting everyone participate on it.

Organizing the data correctly can save a lot of time and prevent mistakes.  Most researchers choose to use a database or statistical analysis program (Microsoft Excel, SPSS) that they can format to fit their needs in order to organize their data effectively.  A good researcher enters all of the data in the same format and in the same database, as doing otherwise might lead to confusion and difficulty with the statistical analysis later on.  Once the data has been entered, it is crucial that the researcher check the data for accuracy.  This can be accomplished by spot-checking a random assortment of participant data groups, but this method is not as effective as re-entering the data a second time and searching for discrepancies.  This method is particularly easy to do when using numerical data because the researcher can simply use the database program to sum the columns of the spreadsheet and then look for differences in the totals.  Perhaps the best method of accuracy checking is to use a specialized computer program that cross-checks double-entered data for discrepancies (as this method is free from error), though these programs can be hard to come by and may require extra training to use correctly.",1332153822

Up until about a year ago I was working as a cinema projectionist for a very successful UK cinema chain. It was a decent job, right up until the point where the company announced a plan to completely replace all 35mm projectors with new digital machines. Now, up until this point we had maybe 3 Digital projectors already installed and we had become quite fond of them, they had a lot of problems and were much less reliable than the 35mm machines but hey, progress is progress.<p>The real problem was that the company intended to make every single one of us redundant in the same move, as they had some crack-pot idea that the digital projectors would ""practically run themselve"" (which we knew from experience would never work). This is when I realised that the old myth of ""as old jobs disappear new ones will take their place"" wasn't true. The company had no intention of generating new work, each cinema site would simply shift the work of running the new projection suite onto the existing (overworked and underpaid) management staff, and the work of maintaining the macines would shift to the existing (overworked and underpaid) technical crew, who were already zipping up and down the country 364 days per year.<p>The company could have generated some new work to replace the jobs that were lost, but ultimately they don't _want_ to do that. It's much more in the companys interests to jettison as much of their workforce as possible. Fortunately for myself, I had already decided to go back to school and get a degree in software development. Better to be at the devils right hand than in his path. :)<p>It's not technology that's really killing the labour-force, it's companies who jump at the opportunity to get rid of thousands of employees and essentially delete their productivity from the economy.",1332152927

They can easily afford a one-off 2-3 point dividend tomorrow and then announce a regular dividend yield of 2-3 points again without repatriating any cash.<p>I doubt it will be larger than a few points, which means that the stock will likely fall sharply tomorrow (as it did with both Cisco and Microsoft) as it seems that the market is expecting a much larger dividend.<p>Note: it is possible to issue a larger dividend without repatriating overseas assets by borrowing against those foreign assets, but I doubt they would do that.",1332152866

Just because the specification is simple it doesn't mean the patterns and lessons are straightforward, and I'm a pretty slow learner.  If you read the Go FAQ you will note that about 1/3 of it is along the lines of ""Why doesn't Go..."".  When I see that sort of language it's clear that between the lines there's a lot to learn, and the only way for me to learn a language is to write code.<p>But after all of this I think I'm going to have to write one of my site-specific crawlers in Go for fun;  since Go has a STOMP binding it should be easy to integrate into my existing architecture.  Where things will get interesting is finding a compatible serialization library (and so we start getting into the real world problems of using a new language to solve interesting problems... hopefully one of the .NET protocol buffer implementations will work correctly with the one I imagine exists for Go).",1332151285

From TFA:<p><i>As we had predicted, the students with a growth mind-set felt that learning was a more important goal in school than getting good grades. In addition, they held hard work in high regard, believing that the more you labored at something, the better you would become at it. They understood that even geniuses have to work hard for their great accomplishments. Confronted by a setback such as a disappointing test grade, students with a growth mind-set said they would study harder or try a different strategy for mastering the material.</i><p><i>The students who held a fixed mind-set, however, were concerned about looking smart with little regard for learning. They had negative views of effort, believing that having to work hard at something was a sign of low ability. They thought that a person with talent or intelligence did not need to work hard to do well. Attributing a bad grade to their own lack of ability, those with a fixed mind-set said that they would study less in the future, try never to take that subject again and consider cheating on future tests.</i>",1220856322

yep images are super important. it's the best way to associate people to comments.<p>there's this site I just discovered this week: dipity.com
it looks like the best way to share lots of information on the web right now. surely, wiht sites like this one, the internet could become a very intense social place, for dating and even work, teaming up with peers. when you see time lines that people made themselves, I think you can see their personnality, interests, but also culture and ideology very fast.<p>Maybe the web will provide us with even better social interfaces than what nature gave us: talking, body langage, clothes and fashion, and talking about your musical preferences etc. all this and much more could take place on the web I think! let's make it happen :DD
well for now dipity.com looks pretty exciting add me there I'm ""smoothboom"" and I just made a time line about memetics.",1220855366
298057,story,,,4,20,themenace,"Ask HN: Secret military technology as groundbreaking as the tank and airplane were  ",,"Reporter Bob Woodward (whose reporting led to Nixon's resignation)
claims that the US military has a new secret technique that's so
revolutionary that it's on par with the tank and the airplane.<p>Here's the relevant quote from his interview with Scott Pelley
on 60 Minutes last night:<p>Woodward: This is very sensitive and very top secret, but there
are secret operational capabilities that have been developed by the
military to locate, target, and kill leaders [in Iraq].<p>Pelley: What is this? Some kind of surveillance, some kind of
targeted way of taking out just the ... leadership?<p>Woodward: ... It is the stuff of which military novels are written.<p>Pelley: Do you mean to say that this special capability is
such an advance in military technique and technology that
it reminds you of the advent of the tank and the airplane?<p>Woodward: Yeah.<p>Quoted from the 60 Minutes video starting at 7 minutes 55 seconds:
http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/04/60minutes/main4415771.shtml<p>I'd like to ask the readers here what they think this groundbreaking
technology might be?  I'll start off with these two guesses which
might be feasible today:<p>(1) facial recognition by satellite or high-flying aircraft<p>(2) wholesale tracking and transcription of all cell phone calls",1220855339

Some record industry rep explained that the industry wasn't thrilled about digital (even if people pay) because it cannot <i>sustain</i> on 'singles alone.' He seemed fairly confident that there cannot be any change of standard until they're confident that the new the change is <i>sustainable</i>.<p>It's one thing complain that their rights are being trampled by piracy.

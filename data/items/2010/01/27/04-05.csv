It's not synced over the internet, but since I can just fold it and slip it in my pocket, that doesn't matter. It's not backed up, but since what I write on paper is all temporary I don't really care.<p>The most important part is that I can scribble things out, and add meaning to things by varying the size, font, color I'm writing in. I can write things sideways, in margins, with arrows connecting them, circled, with my own made up punctuation marks.<p>I guess I'll see if this Apple tablet catches up on any of these fronts,  but I kind of doubt it.",1264568381

C is, after all, what the world is built on. If you really want to show us a better way, you'd be better served by trying to help build that world.<p>How about <i>just one</i> core library that does something useful and irreplacable on a modern system, and that works significantly better than the dinosaur code you keep complaining about?  We've seen enough toy implementations and cute hacks (and, gack, web frameworks!) to last a lifetime.<p>How about a clean, bug-free and parallel implementation of zlib instead?  Or a better h.264 codec?  Or a crypto/TLS implementation that beats openssl?  Regular expression engine better than pcre? World-class numerics library?  GUI framework?  SVG implementation? HTML parser?  3D modeling and rendering framework? ...

They go out of their way to stop jailbreakers and consider them criminals, and per the DMCA they're probably right. It will be terrible for future innovation if the only way to gain control over your own hardware is to become a felon.</i><p>Of course they don't like people jailbreaking, they've worked very long and hard on making a store with a fair and seamless DRM system - then barely a week after it's jailbroken somebody has gone and made an almost one-step process for cracking, distributing and downloading pirated applications. DRM relies on a closed system by it's very nature - it's understandable they like to discourage against subjugating their entire business model.<p>HOWEVER: they have never (as of my knowlege) put in additional effort to prevent jailbreaking. The online media a few years ago was buzzing with warnings about updates bricking jailbroken iPhones - like if done out of some sort of malice when it turns out the problem was AnySIM completely trashing some areas of the baseband, rendering it unusable when updated next.<p>So let's see, Apple getting a ton of bad press misdirected at them (as usual) because of the clumsy mistakes of some people who didn't really test their baseband modifying software before releasing it to the public.<p>Oh, and a more recent example. The installer for OpenSSH in Cydia didn't bother to prompt a change for the default root password on the iPhone (alpine) - suddenly there's a ""virus"" spreading between unsecured jailbroken iPhones because of clueless idiots once again thinking they know what they're doing when they clearly don't. The press? ""OMG ITS TEH IPHONE VIRUSSSSS RUN FOR THE HILLS!!"" Do you think they bothered to mention that you had to a) Jailbreak your phone, b) Install OpenSSH and c) Neglect to change the default password? Of course not, who cares insignificant details like that when you can have a headline with the words ""iPhone"" and ""virus"" both in it.<p>Gee, I wonder why Apple don't like jailbreaking guys?<p>Meanwhile, it would be na√Æve to think that Apple doesn't have plenty of jailbroken iPhones they use internally for various things. I have no doubt they are keeping a very close eye on the progress of the JB scene.<p><i>Along with anything that remotely competes with Apple's business model. If Microsoft had that level of control 20 years ago, we wouldn't have the web.</i><p>We don't know the exact reason for many Apple's rejections, but I disagree with this sentiment in general - there are hundreds of examples of approved apps which directly with Apple's own offerings and if you're referring to the GV rejection in particular that's even more puzzling as it doesn't compete with Apple at all (unless they're secretly planning on becoming a telco?) Examples of approved apps which might enroach on Apple's territory are various Safari replacements (iCab etc), Map applications, and even Spotify; clearly stepping on the toes of iTunes store. The problem is the inconsistency, which to me points more toward individual agent whims or moods rather than policy. I agree this is unacceptable but they have promised to make it better. They have stated publicly that they approve > 99% of apps, so as usual it's a vocal minority.<p><i>That's a testable prediction, since Android offers exactly that setting. We'll see if it becomes a cesspool of malware; I don't expect it to.</i><p>There has already been a bank account phishing app which was undiscovered for weeks on the Android Marketplace. I wonder why whoever coded that didn't target the iPhone instead and get 100x the opportunity?<p>Oh that's right, they couldn't. The system works.",1264567674

Price: I typically read a lot of business reference books that are primarily sold to professionals and as a result are pricy.

Convenience: I really like to have ebook copies of all of my books. I often like to work outside of my home and find it extremely convenient to have all of my books in my laptop. They are also amazing for quick reference. Having a searchable copy of a book is very useful for referencing key items.<p>3.

Most of my work involves being at a computer, performing research and being able to quickly switch to an ebook whenever I am there fits in with my work flow.<p>I still buy books, on Sunday I picked up three at a used bookstore.

They would also be storing the tools they use to build the products themselves in there (compiler, linker, assembler, etc).<p>I would also wager that a lot of the 15TB of data is historical in nature, a lot of that for products that aren't being made or sold anymore but for which the source code, compiled images, etc is still stored there.<p>Version control is not necessarily just for source code or text files, and what better place to store these extra version-specific artefacts than in the version control system.",1264565030

But in another year or two I expect that I will have switched to toting around some kind of tablet/ebook device to get a more flexible reading experience. I've already started feeling constrained by the selection available from a single store. I'm waiting on the technology to settle down a little, work through the early-adopter headaches, and present a really solid experience before I switch, but once I make that switch I'll have no reason to prefer Borders for coffee drinking - I could go anywhere to do my reading. I know I'm not alone in this behavior. I'll buy newspapers sometimes while I'm out, but that's about it.<p>Borders is already a company in trouble, and I don't see any reason for their fortunes to go up unless they make a drastic business model change to reflect the rise of e-reading. It won't be much different for other booksellers; niche literature will last for longer since they won't be digitized for a while, but mainstream publishing is about to get clobbered.<p>Paper for writing, sketches, and other creative tasks will stick around for a long time to come, though. I can buy a tiny pocket notebook and pencils for ~$5, and they'll continue to beat out the high-tech stuff for a good many years to come.<p>The ""iSomethingSomething"" might be that killer device, or it might wait for another generation or two. There is no ""if"" in my mind about the overall direction of things, though.",1264564945

28372,comment,28176,28210,0,0,cwilbur,,,"Right, but stupid business types don't distinguish between ""web startup"" and ""non-web startup.""  You might be able to make headway by talking about core competencies and business expertise.<p>Outsourcing programming tasks is a very reasonable thing to do when the core of your business is something else and the programming is just supporting that.  If your business's core expertise and value proposition is that you have highly skilled plumbers on call 24/7, then insisting on developing the website and billing software in-house is a waste of effort.  But when the core of your business is the software, outsourcing it is foolish.  If your business's core expertise and value proposition is that you have a location and scheduling algorithm that will guarantee you get an affiliated plumber at your house within 30 minutes of your request, then the software to support that should be developed in-house.<p>This is something that <i>good</i> business guys will understand.",1181922822

It's clear, it's readable, it's concise, and it's wrong.<p>Readability and correctness are orthogonal concepts. <p>",1181922363
28368,comment,27623,27957,0,0,cwilbur,,,"I'm talking about the ability to go to the doctor routinely, to get things like vaccinations and annual checkups.  The government doesn't <i>make</i> you do sensible things elsewhere, but the cost of doing sensible things if you're in the US and don't have health insurance is prohibitive.<p>To take an example from dentistry:  getting a biennial checkup, finding an early-stage developing cavity, and getting it fixed will most likely cost you under $200.  Not getting the checkup and waiting until the tooth is abscessed and requires extraction, a root canal, or oral surgery can cost you $2000 or more.  But if you don't have the $50 for the initial checkup, what are you supposed to do?",1181922161

28358,comment,28352,28353,0,0,pg,,,"Yeah, looks like there is some kind of problem.  It looks like some arguments (specifically the fnid argument) may not be getting sent to the server in form submissions, though Firefox and Explorer do send this argument. Any Safari experts have any idea what might be going on?  <p>Edit: The args arrive fine.  The prob may be with the redirect after the form submission.  The main difference I see in requests from Firefox and Safari is that F says Connection: keep-alive and S says Connection: close.<p>Edit 2: The prob is with redirects, not forms.  But I'm not sure why, and it doesn't happen in more recent versions of Safari.",1181919686

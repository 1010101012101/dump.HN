It makes very little sense to me, to pay back $17K <i>privately</i> (so that's after taxes) means that you'd have to be earning roughly double that just to get rid of this debt, at a regular salary and expenses that comes down to at least two years before you can get rid of that debt, not counting the interest.<p>How does that make any sense at all, is your credit rating worth 20K and two years of your life to you?",1285361997

MongoDB effectively replaced all those other systems for us and was _significantly_ easier to set up and develop against.<p>A few people have mentioned HBase as an alternative. We did not consider HBase at the time we were making our architecture choices, however if we were starting today, we'd probably have looked at it too. My first impressions of HBase are that it lacks the level of documentation & community support behind MongoDB. I am definitely going to dig in some more to see how it would compare. That being said, we're totally happy with our choice of MongoDB and would recommend it to anybody considering HBase.",1285361960

The problem is that there is no real convergence on “commonly-used” versions of libraries. There is no ABI protection, nor general guidelines on versioning.  You end up having to package each and every minor version of a library that the software happens to want. </i><p>I don't understand why this is a problem exactly.  If a dev runs and tests against a particular version of a library, use that version.  Even minor updates in libraries can cause problems.  If the library has a security issue, blacklist the version and force the upstream dev of both the library and the app to acknowledge the issue and release a new versions of their projects.",1285361788

Incorporation isn't the secret trick for conduct risk-free confidence jobs on people. You can't incorporate, sell Springfield the sham monorail, and skip town scot-free. Obviously, if your company is a criminal enterprise, all bets are off. On the other hand, the laws that provide alter ego liability aren't the secret key to unlocking corporate liability shields.<p>Since (a) the poster's company almost certainly wasn't a fraud, and (b) most companies that fail also aren't likely to be frauds, and (c) it is prohibitively expensive to attempt to prove in court that a company was a fraud, and (d) most of the officers of small startup companies aren't going to be in a position to pay at the end of a court battle, none of this matters.<p>Also: note how little of this has anything to do with how many shares the guy owns.<p>We are seriously geeking out here over something that isn't relevant to this guy's problem.

Just try it swordless (except, of course, on Gannon).<p>Most of the SNES-era games are still great, IMHO.  It really depends on the game as to whether or not it ages well.  Even classics like PacMan is still just as fun as ever.  Some early RPGs?  Not so much.  Yeah, I still love the original Final Fantasy, but the original Dragon Warrior has a horrific grind, but so do later games like 7th Saga (a SNES game).  The only thing that fixes the grind in FF1 are those two tiles where you can meet giants early and if I didn't know about them, I'd have probably given up on the game by now, because of the steep grind when you hit Elfland.<p>That makes me believe that our tolerance for clunky UIs changes over time.  For example, if I can't automatically keep my items sorted and organized without flipping things around one-by-one, I get frustrated.  It's one of the few bad parts of EarthBound (a game I really loved for the creative writing... seriously, even the back of a billboard is likely to contain a joke).<p>In that respect, Ultima has one of the worst UIs because it was so complex and people hadn't figured out how to simplify it yet.  In that respect, later Ultimas seem worse to me, because each one is more complex than the last.  I can still have a bit of fun with Ultima 1 on the NES.  More than I have with the later ones, anyhow.  I wonder if the guy who invented automatic note taking in games was playing Ultima at the time... it would make a lot of sense.",1285361498

With distros like RHEL and Ubuntu LTS, they lose ALL value as a platform for ruby or python development because they don't release often enough or worry about breakage to keep those languages up to date.<p>This is why companies like ActiveState are making a KILLING providing supported after-market dynamic language binaries.<p>What the distros should be doing is, besides isolating any dynamic language they use for system-level configuration, providing with the support of the language vendors an installable local package repository.

For you to be on the hook for Rackspace/Company debts, Rackspace will have to convince a court that both you and Rackspace had an understanding that <i>you</i> were the one making a hosting agreement. Against that will be the fact that they invoiced your company, accepted payments for your company, signed a contract with your company, and that the service they provided was used solely for your company.<p>Since companies go out of business all the time, my guess is that this never happens. Why would Rackspace waste time going after company debts when 99% of the time they'll never see a dime, and, on occasion, may risk legal action themselves by bringing frivolous lawsuits?<p>There <i>are</i> situations where you can slip up and obligate yourself to your company's creditors; if you Google, you'll find out for instance that in Iowa you want to be very careful about how your company's checks are layed out and signed.

What I'm saying is that the code you produced is effectively a counterargument to deterministic quicksort and doesn't apply in the random case. What McIlroy is doing is selecting an element on the fly during the algorithm. If quicksort was randomized, he would not be able to do so. Thus his argument breaks down there.<p>If you are constructing a ""worst case"" for randomized quicksort, the answer is still obviously O(n^2), but the purpose of randomized quicksort is that it is O(nlogn) EXPECTED running time. Thus, by constructing a worst case input, you really haven't broken randomized quicksort at all. In fact, you're doing exactly what its intended to do: perform badly sometimes, perform well other times, and in the expected case, perform O(nlogn).<p>I read the entire paper, and I'm, of course, no expert, but I've ran my argument past a professor in algorithms (who is a Turing award winner), and he also believes that McIlroy's argument does not work for the randomized case.<p>His heuristic cannot be legitimately applied in the randomized case because the adversary simply is not allowed to choose elements in the randomized case. That, of course, is the purpose of randomization. Thus, it doesn't matter what his code or heuristic shows. His argument has a logical fallacy and thus is illegitimate (only when applied to the randomized case of course).",1285359888

1725176,comment,1724614,1724866,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"My understanding of these things is that this kind of debt is mostly unsecured. If a house is repossessed and sold at a loss after the mortgage has fallen into arrears by more than a certain percentage, the unsecured creditors get nothing. Of course, now nearly every repo is sold at a loss, and there are 2x as many empty properties sitting on the books as are advertised for sale, so that's not going to change for a while.<p>Remember that the toxic asset is not a collection of salami slices from different mortgages - there are laws against dividing up a mortgage or loan interest that way, I believe. The slices were claims on the <i>profit</i> - the sum of mortgage payments minus cost of capital, and were paid out in exchange for cash up front.<p>Holding these assets seemed like a good idea at the time they were issued, because even if Joe Blow lost his job or whatever, the rising property market meant that he or the loan service company just had to be patient for a few months - then the house could be sold for more than the value of the debt, the unsecured creditors would be OK. Joe Blow himself would have a clean slate unless he was truly incompetent, because before the bubble burst it was fairly easy to offload the property and look like a responsible individual who serviced debt promptly. I heard of people doing that and ending up with a <i>better</i> credit rating as a result, because on paper they were now the sort of person that does profitable 6-figure real estate transactions. The smart ones gave classes, the stupid ones believed their credit reports and started thinking they were financial wizards.<p>On the issue side, it worked like so: I give Joe Blow a $500k mortgage, he is supposed to give me back $1m over 20 years or whatever the compound interest + principal amounts to. Well great, but now I have to wait a decade before I start actually making money on the deal. Traditionally, banks' business model is to control enough capital and manage risk well enough to play that long game, in fact to play a longer game than anybody else on the market. But in recent decades, so much money had gone into the stock market via retirement funds etc. that bringing in your profit over a 10-30 year period looked rather tame. Sure, there were big profit multiples in the credit card business, but it takes time for most people to run up substantial credit card debt, and the kind of people who rack up house-size debts quickly are unfortunately the sort of people who tend to pay them off too because they understand how to use credit effectively, so they are not generating any profit. And in a rising market, those long-term profits seem to have a very high opportunity cost, because although they are secured by property, I could probably double my money faster by investing it in some dot com thing, whatever that means...<p>Meanwhile, I'm out the $500k I just gave to Joe Blow, and my competition across the street is just celebrating an IPO of clueless,com that paid off at 32:1. Damn! But wait - YOU look like a smart guy. Look, I have this mortgage on Joe Blow's house, and 99 others just like it. Houses - lovely solid assets, not like those inflationary stocks. They're even better than gold, because you can't live in a goldbrick, amirite? And who invests in gold, that's no way to make money any more, the 70s were a long time ago.<p>I'm gonna collect $500k from Joe over the next 20 years! He'll pay because it's his house, duh. My cost of capital from the federal reserve? Cheap, they only want $100k in interest, God bless Alan Greenspan. No, you can't raise capital there, you need a banking license like I have but they're like taxi medallions, you gotta wait years to get one. But look, about this $400k profit I make after I pay the Fed off. Times 100 mortgages that I've issued, that's $40 million dollars of <i>pure profit</i> - and this profit is on debt secured with <i>$50 million</i> worth of houses...at today's prices. And they're not making any new land, heh heh!<p>Oh, you wish you could get in on this? Yeah, too bad you don't have a banking license like me...but come to think of it, don't a lot of taxi guys rent out their cab, and everybody wins? Yeah! How about this: you give me $50 million, and I'll split the $40m profit with you, even Stevens, $20 mil each and I'll do all the hard work of collecting the payments each month and I'll hold all the risk. What's in it for me? Well, I'll issue some more mortgages, I got people trying to buy property faster than the hired help can build it. What's in it for you? $20 million my friend, and peace of mind. How long do you think this bank has been here?<p>OK, it was more complicated than that - there was an investment bank in the middle giving the sales pitch and gift-wrapping the item, and they were getting paid a commission up front. But this was the basic transaction that both sides suckered themselves into, and on which both sides lost money while the investment bank kept its cash commission.",1285358524

The good/great teachers are able to empathize with the students position of not having any of that knowledge, and can effectively build up the entire structure to make what they learned meaningful. The poor teachers just teach the final layer and wonder why people aren't getting it.",1250265542

Given that fact, lets say I hop in a spaceship and zip around the earth at near light speed for several years (Yes, I know there are problems with this in terms of increased mass, energy needed, etc.) Ok, so after several years I slow down and land. For me, it seems as if I've traveled into the future becasue the people on earth have experienced more time than I have.<p>How is that not time travel, at least in a functional sense? I get that by strict definition it may not be, but the result would be the same. It seems like in this sense time travel is not only possible but proven.",1250265537

Everyone writes their own implementations of relatively basic things, because the existing libraries don't do things in exactly the way they'd prefer, and it's just not painful to write a library that does just the parts <i>you</i> need.  Clojure might get around this by tying itself to Java, as long as most Clojurists come from the Java world and are used to using those same libraries already.",1250265445

It's great to have someone ""within ranks"" saying what many have been saying for decades.<p>One of the problems in the field is summed here> <i>""Why are certain long-term epidemiology/observation studies (EOS) continued in spite of the persistent publication of pseudoscience from these studies?""</i><p>Those type of studies are why they keep flipping on eggs. It's <i>oxidized</i> cholesterol (and saturated fat) which helps along heart disease, not the generic form. In fact, the body makes both if you don't eat enough. [1][2] Are our bodies trying to kill us?<p><i>""there is no convincing comparative outcome evidence (as I defined above) that common foodstuffs, e.g., saturated fats like butter, rapidly absorbed carbohydrates like white rice and potatoes, or animal proteins, are especially helpful or harmful.""</i><p>The body prefers saturated fat as a fuel source. Body fat is mostly saturated. When you burn fat your running on ""artery clogging"" saturated fat. Secondly it likes glucose. It converts all carbs sources to glucose then glycogen. But when you overload calories (from say, rice), the body trans-saturates it to palmitic acid, a saturated fat. [3]<p>Hi-GI foods, like rice and potatoes, turn to glycogen quicker. Supposedly high-GI = bad. But I think the better theory is high-GI = bad, given qualifiers x and y.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipogenesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipogenesis</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitic_acid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitic_acid</a>",1250264842

As I flipped through, I realized, this isn't a book of home plans, it's a catalog for plans that you can buy.  So I thought, are they <i>selling</i> this?  There's nothing in it of value, just pictures of more things that you have to buy later.  I looked at the back and sure enough, the catalog itself cost $10 and they dont even have the prices of the home plans themselves.  If you want the blue prints for the house, you have to pay MORE money and those cost $60 or more.<p>And so I started thinking of course, like any hacker would... I've been looking for examples of industries that give away the product of their work.  Here was one in architecture and construction. Not only are the blue prints not free, but the catalog of things not free isn't even free.  So it's like, two layers of <i>not</i> free in the same industry.<p>Can you imagine architects giving away their blue prints?  Essentially, that's what source code is, it's a blue print for a product.  It's an encapsulation of a lot of work, research and development, experimentation, and energy.  If architects gave away the blue prints for homes, then architects would have trouble eating.<p>I know, people say, you can't pay for passion. If people are passionate about software, they'll do it for free.  But I'm not so sure that's true. I think there are reasons other than money and passion about software to write software, popularity for example.<p>Here's the rub, every other popular industry gets money in exchange for their contribution.  ""If you're good at something, don't do it for free.""<p>Of course I wonder, ""Why am I so opposed to Open Source?""  Am I insecure about my code? Am I delusional?  If so many, seemingly rational people, are pro Open Source, why am I so closed?<p>It's a real debate inside my head. I don't think it's insecurity.  I have no problem writing code that is open and viewable to people who pay me to write it. I would have no problem writing open source code for a company that was paying me to write the code.  If it's their code, and they are paying me to write it for them, please, show it to the world -- better for me. I've written enterprise code that never got used outside the company and wished I had something to show people.  ""I built this badass system for nuclear plants, you should have seen it!""  But of course they can't...<p>I'm just thinking of the logical conclusion... what are the long term consequences of FOSS?  I think about incentives here. I think about comparisons between teachers and athletes for example. We say, ""We should pay teachers like we pay athletes.""  I've actually considered being a teacher.  Everyone tells me I would be a great one.  I really love this stuff.  But why should I encourage people to go into a field where I know they will have a tough time eating because there are too many people giving away free labor?  How can engineers pay for food if no one is paying them?<p>Why is this so difficult for me to understand?  I'm not stupid. I'm pretty smart.  Why doesn't something that seems so obvious to so many other seemingly smart people not make sense to me?<p>Compare our industry to Medicine and Law. It's actually <i>illegal</i> for people who aren't doctors or lawyer to dispense medical advice or legal advice.  These clever professions engineered these laws to protect their industry.  Oh, I know lots will cringe at the thought of that.  I know the thought is that stuff like this subsidizes crappy coders through artificial scarcity.  I'm still not convinced the scarcity is <i>actually</i> scarce, because the production of the product depends on the consumption of scarce products, but I digress...<p>I think the debate about the flamewar over web programming being stupid is one ramification of this issue.  Web programming isn't actually easy.  It's easy to a point, just like carpentry is easy to a point and plumbing is easy to a point and electrical work is easy to a point.  But it's also easy to be dangerous.  It's easy to biuld homes that fall down and plumbing that starts leaking next year and wire a home to catch fire.  If you don't have training and education and experience, it's easier to make mistakes.<p>I see so many people without a background in programming write poorly architected code that performs like a dog and just breaks... it breaks because some wanabe hacker just jumped in and started hacking without knowing wtf (s)he was doing and it ends up costing the company paying for the work more money later on.  And you can't blame the consumer. They don't know. They don't know if they give someone their credit card information whether or not that company actually gives a crap about security and if they do, they can actually implement good security protocols.  And don't say open source helps with this, because plenty of open source products have <i>huge</i> security holes.  I see people complaining all the time about XSS vulnerabilities in word press plugins and with something like that, I could easily write a keylogger that would send your credit card number typed into a wordpress hacked online store right to my database...  Probably lots of .cn sites are already doing it...<p>Anyway, I'll stop ranting now...",1250264721

It not only works well, it gives students a sense of accomplishment.<p>2. Let students come to their own conclusions about the subject material before you correct them. College students are not stupid.

I've developed both courses for students of IT and music as well as several ""Train the Trainer"" courses.<p>One thing I will do is to address the term ""good teacher"". A good teacher is very different from a ""great teacher."" I'll simply address good teachers in my post.<p>I do chuckle a bit when I read the replies that say, ""This - you have to do this to be a good teacher."" It's all so subjective. I've seen good teachers who were not great enthusiasts, good teachers who didn't give a #### about their students, and good teachers who lived and breathed the technology, loved their students, and were good people.<p>In my opinion being a good teacher requires wanting to be a good teacher, practicing the techniques of educating the age group you are teaching (there are massive differences in teaching each age group), and knowing the topic at hand.<p>If you actually care about the people you are educating, that is bonus but there are plenty of good teachers who, at the end of the day, couldn't care less about this group of students or whether they ""get it"". To give you an example, some of the great teachers <i>know</i> that they are great teachers and know that simply taking a class with them is an honor and they take the attitude, ""If you're taking my class and you don't get it, then something is wrong with you - not my fault. <hundreds/thousands> have taken this class and gotten tons out of it and if you don't, too bad.""<p>Just because you are an enthusiast means nothing - I've seen good teachers who barely know the topic. What they are good at, though, is simplifying complex topics and helping students understand the topics. The good teacher does not have to be a guru (and for many people, the more they know, the less of a good teacher they become because they lose the ability to make it understandable for the student).<p>As for passion, passion makes it easier for the student, sure, but it isn't a requirement to be a good teacher. I've seen lots of good teachers who learn a subject just so they can keep a job. They don't give a ### about that subject but, because they want to be good teachers and they work hard at it, they are good at teaching that topic. Would it be better if they were passionate about it? Absolutely.<p>All in all, I think it's a combination of several things to be a good teacher but passion and guru-ness aren't in that set. I think the want to be a good teacher is paramount and, along with that want, is a work ethic that drives you to become and remain a good teacher. Anything above and beyond that only makes you better.",1250262366

Total prep is 20 minutes and I have a week's worth of lunches.  The most expensive ingredient is the olive oil, which I buy in jugs from the warehouse store.",1250262293

It makes the old applications less relevant.<p>A blog is not a replacement for a word processor.  But many of the things you might have written, printed out, copied, and distributed to people you wanted to see it, you just type into your blog and you're done with it.  And blogs make new kinds of writing possible that wasn't before, meaning even less time spent in front of a word processor.<p>When several people needed to work on the same document before, they put a word processing document on a network share, or just emailed it around to the next person who had to work on it.  Now, a wiki makes a lot more sense for editing and sharing that kind of data.<p>A desktop money management application can't compete with a web application that can keep your transactions up to date for all of your online financial accounts.  I suppose you could implement this as a desktop application, but most of the power comes from the data being available from the web, so what's the point?<p>People used to use a spreadsheet or desktop database to store and process their financial data, but it makes more sense for the logic for handling your financial data living close to that data, in a way that a lot of people can benefit from without typing in all the formulas themselves.  So the use cases for the average person to use a spreadsheet diminish.<p>The end result, is that people don't really care whether they have a direct replacement for their old apps.  As long as they have a convenient way to meet the end result (communicate, manage finances), that's all that matters.",1250262292

That's what I do, and I respect everyone else who does that. That's WHY I believe the original sentiment is so flawed. Just because you use C and have to deal with tricky memory issues doesn't actually make the problems you solve any more interesting or useful.

And I really mean, getting rid of it, even in my thinking.  You see, the nicotine addiction is just the minor part in smoking, it is not that hard, other drugs are harder to get rid of in my experience.  But the manipulation in your thinking that comes with years-long smoking, that is astonishing.  And the main factor that makes it hard to quit smoking is a deep fear that life will never again be as awesome as it was with the cigs (even if the smoking destroys so much life moments all the time).<p>I got rid of it by reading the book ""Easy way out"" by Allen Carr.  I highly recommend his stuff.  I did read the book 3 times in a row until all the thinking damage in my head was gone.  But then it was gone and after smoking heavily for 8 years I am now out for over 6 years.<p>If you think about quitting smoking, try Allen Carrs method, I truly recommend it, from man to man ;-)",1250262125

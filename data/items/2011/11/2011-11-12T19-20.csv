3228735,comment,3227994,3228648,11,0,robdodson,,,"I felt the exact same way for a very, very long time. A few things changed my mind.<p>The first was the realization that Adobe wasn't going to make any more cool fun stuff for me. I feel like they've just lost their way with all that and now that I look back on it, it seems like Macromedia actually made all the aspects of Flash that I enjoy. The most recent thing Adobe has done for me is Stage3D but even that is so technical that they're relying on 3rd parties like Away3D to build the friendly API on top of it.<p>The second was doing a project that was as close to an art piece as I've ever come doing ad agency work that was entirely in HTML/CSS3 and JS. It was actually this project if you want to see some pictures: <a href=""http://inchwormstudio.com/?portfolio=samsung-coast-to-coast-photo-post"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inchwormstudio.com/?portfolio=samsung-coast-to-coast-...</a>
What I found while I was doing that project was that the web has changed a lot while I've been doing Flash and I didn't realize how much annoying obtuse boilerplate I had to write in AS3 that just becomes total cake when you're using HTML for markup, CSS for style and JS for slick transitions and communication. My main love affair is with HTML and JS, I still think CSS is...CSS. With HTML I'm getting all the great structural stuff that Flex devs love, without the mind numblingly elaborate class structures they have to deal with. With good JS libraries like jQuery I'm getting the cross browser DOM support that I need because I just don't have those sea legs yet. And when you combine it all you can work really, really fast. I spent the whole first half of that project cursing JavaScript up and down the office. I would make little examples showing how setInterval loses scope and demo it for my team and be like ""look! this stuff is retarded! I want AS3 back!"" Then one day I had to build this twitter widget, and I sat down and I just cranked it out in no time. And I thought, 'You know, if I had been doing this in Flash I would have spent so much time dealing with URLLoaders and cross policy files and coreLib for JSON parsing...' It just felt like things had gone smoother because I wasn't fighting against the web to make it fit inside my Flash app. And that was about the time that I felt like I got over the hump, and from there it was all downhill.<p>It totally had warts and I got stung by IE transparency bugs but in the end we sorted it all out and now I know how to deal with those issues. And to be honest, they were pretty minimal. The Facebook API was far worse than the cross browser stuff.<p>If you're making the transition then read this: <a href=""http://jqfundamentals.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jqfundamentals.com/</a>
I read it start to finish and it made things so much easier for me. Then once you're comfortable with jQuery, leave it behind and try the other stuff. It feels like there is SO much more to experiment with in the JS world than the AS world and I think that's largely because the community is exponentially larger. Hope that's helpful.",1321127870

No, one closes the current context. Lets say you have 10 Word documents open, you can close the single instance using the red button, if you use the yellow button it minimizes it down to the dock. The two buttons have very different behaviors.<p>When you have Microsoft Word open on Windows, you can have multiple documents open as well, when you close one you don't want to close all of them, well on Mac OS X when you close the last one it won't quit the full application, whereas in Windows it will. Mac OS X Lion has solved this by allowing applications to specify that they are no longer in use and when required they will be quit.<p><pre><code>  > am I copying/pasting/cutting?,

And on the whole, I agree that Homebrew is considerably inferior. But there is one aspect I'm liking better about the Homebrew/Mac approach. With Homebrew I can have the latest software without a problem, because the OS itself is not so hooked in to the web of package manager dependencies. In many cases on Linux I just wait until the next OS release to upgrade software - because toying with the huge dependency graph is not worth it. Maybe I should switch to a rolling release distro?

Since they work alone, they don't need to shoot disloyal gang members, and they are too small to have real turf wars.

3228636,comment,3227576,3227576,5,0,tripzilch,,,"Hi! I work at a ""Young Researchers Centre"", a sort of after-school crafts-and-technology place for kids of roughly ages 8-12. They can work wood carpentry, clay pottery, fabric, metalworks (lots of cute jewelry made from resistors :) ), electronics/soldering, Lego Mindstorms and of course computers. I supervise at the last two.<p>We don't let them play webgames, YouTube, Facebook or Pokemon websites or things like that, except for the final 30 minutes which is free time (though I still won't let them on Facebook--that's a hairy situation I'll let the parents sort out responsibility over at home. I believe the webfilter blocks it too).<p>Anyway, what they <i>can</i> do: Creating animations with a stick-figure animation program called Pivot, build plain HTML+images websites (with jEdit free syntax highlighting editor that also works over FTP) and create games with the free trial of Gamemaker (GUI-based point-and-click programming, not bad at all). Oh and this afternoon I helped a little guy shoop fake Pokemon cards in GIMP :-)<p>We <i>are</i> looking at introducing a little bit more actual programming into the possibilities, though. I visited this very same centre at the age of ten, and I'd just fire up QBASIC and start coding funky graphics, and there were at least one or two other kids that did similar.<p>My personal experience is that level of ability varies a <i>lot</i> with age, they develop real quick in this age-range. I wouldn't try and teach an 8 year old to program, not even with GameMaker. For some reason kids that age do not yet seem to have developed this hyper-interested bite-your-teeth-in-it persistence (you probably know what I'm talking about if you started coding at a young age--it's amazing, even if the smartest ones are invariably also super annoying clever little know-it-alls, which I try my best to not let get in the way of teaching them :) ).<p>I did have success with helping an 8 year old kid write his own webpage in HTML. His writing skills were phenomenal for his age, very little spelling errors, just needed to learn proper capitalisation and use of the comma :-) Capitalisation is probably also a result of not yet fully developed motor skills at that age, you can tell that pressing shift with their other hand actually takes them effort. Anyway, he wrote a short introduction about himself and proceeded to write a number of (actually quite funny) jokes and puns. I hope he returns soon, so we can add some styling to the page, it's just plain black-on-white Times with H1, H2 and P tags now.<p>One important thing we try to focus on here, is to give the kids something to do they can actually finish or at least see some tangible results of within one afternoon. It's really demotivating to be real busy for a couple of hours and not have something bounce around your screen at the end of it, preferably as soon as possible.<p>Another important thing is, that it's not school. They're not graded and they don't have to do things perfectly, or even the right way. The kids at electronics are soldering wires onto thumbtacks pushed into a piece of soft wood (with a paper printed diagram pasted on it, they make flashing lightbulbs, simple radios etc). It's very easy and it works, but it's not a proper way to do electronics :) In a similar fashion, I'm not going to push them to write properly CSS-ed content-layout-separated semantic HTML. If it's easier and simpler to use an inline style, or <i>even</i> a TABLE based layout, I'll show them how to do it. It's more important to show them how to get their hands ""dirty"" and that they can make these computers do anything they want, I like to show them quick results and they can always learn to do things the proper way later on.<p>On that note, I realize that PHP is probably the best way to get them started in programming. Most kids can get the hang of HTML pretty quickly (what are the tags for, opening <i>and</i> closing tags, how do you make an image, a link, etc). PHP has the nice property that you can just write it <i>inside</i> the HTML and easily add a little bit of interactivity, with immediate results. Indeed no templating languages, and yes it <i>will</i> grow into a huge tangled mess as they add more and more complexity BUT if there's one young these young kids are very good at, it's keeping track of a tangled mess of their own creation.<p>A simple example, one kid wrote a multi-page HTML website, with a menu bar (just a line of link tags) on top to navigate. What sucks for him is that he has to duplicate the menu code in every HTML page, and if anything changes or he wants to add another menu-link, he has to edit them all. There's no way to solve this in HTML, except with a FRAMESET which is kinda complex (and very outdated). So next time I will show him how, with a single line of <?php include('menubar.html'); ?> he can make things a lot easier for himself. It's still not real programming, but yet another small step along the way, that delivers immediate results.<p>Finally, a completely different idea I had, is to show them how to make simple games with Python and PyGame. IMO, Python is one of the best languages to start out with (I suppose Ruby is also pretty great but I'm not too familiar with it), and PyGame is real easy to use as it has functions for images, sprites, timing and even collision detection. I would start them off with a basic skeleton that opens a window and an event loop and possibly some object moving around or something. I'm not really sure whether I'll pursue this idea, because currently the ""ease-them-into-PHP"" idea sounds better, and I only have so much time to prepare new things :)<p>So, I can only share my experiences, unfortunately not offer much concrete advice, as we're still trying to figure out the best way as well.<p>(BTW myself, I started with BASIC at the age of 9. Reasonable beginners language, but it was also the only choice available for me :) )",1321126089

I've never had to use either my entire life, but I've gone to the doctor many times.<p>I don't like the current system, but complete socialization isn't what I want either.  When you socialize it completely, private care is truly in the hands of the very rich (because private companies can't compete with the government).  Take a look at the UK for a good example of this.<p>I would like to be able to pay for better care, if I have the money and complete government care means I will have no options but to take what the government gives me, which is usually sub-par (or ends up that way when the government runs out of money).<p>In addition to this, when something is free (or can't feel it because they are paying money in taxes), people generally don't appreciate it, and in fact, will abuse it.  We will have more people in the hospitals for things that don't require medical care with less room for people that actually need it.<p>I see a parallel with tech support.  If you are the tech guy that always helps people out for free, you (the resource) will eventually get tired of helping everyone out for free because people will come to you with questions they could have easily Googled or figured out themselves (like going to the hospital for something that doesn't require a doctor's attention).  If you charge money (even if it's a little bit), only the serious people will ask you to do work for them.<p>I think many people (including myself) got into trouble with credit cards because of this.  I would buy things and I it didn't really feel like I was spending money.  $20,000 later, I felt it, but it was almost too late by then.  It took me 3 years to pay it off.  Now, I only spend money that  I have and $10 feels like I'm spending $10.<p>Money is a good way of dividing up a finite resource. Hospitals are a finite resource.  If we got rid of the insurance companies, hospitals wouldn't be able to charge $80 for Aspirin, because most people can't afford it.  We would see the actual cost for things and the rates for everything would go down.<p>A small percentage of the population would still need some form of subsidized, government care, but it could easily be supported by the rest of the system.<p>Nobody will talk about the downsides of universal care.  All of the supporters will only talk about how great it is.  I want to know both sides and if you can't tell me as a supporter, I'm less likely to listen to you in the future.",1321125551

It specifies something fixed that ecompasses a set of variants.<p>For example, an 8 bit number fits this straightforwardly. The number of bits and their interpretation as successive powers of 2 is what is fixed; the actual values of the bits is what varies.<p>It seems quite a good definition: it is simple, and discrete -- it is <i>measurable</i>, and it very neatly fits software/computation. It is pretty much built-in to the basics of what we commonly take as computation, the bit -- a single element (fixed) with two values (varying between 0 or 1). And everything follows on top of that.<p>And furthermore, this definition can even be seen as somehow quasi-fundamental, as inevitably arising in how natural systems behave (well, with a little imagination maybe -- it is worth a ponder) . . .<p><a href=""http://www.hxa.name/notes/note-hxa7241-20110410T0910Z.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hxa.name/notes/note-hxa7241-20110410T0910Z.html</a>",1321125114

Around the time that AS3 came out everyone was griping about how hard it was and what a pain in the ass the static typing was. They were used to the forgiving nature of AS2. But eventually pretty much everyone converted and fell in love with AS3. The departure from AS2 to AS3 is like learning a whole new language, like stepping up from JavaScript to a watered down version of Java. I think that everyone's resistance was not based on how much better 3 was than 2, but really because we just didn't want to change. I don't know any Flash devs with CS degrees. They're all artists and designers and musicians who somehow got into development. For us, changing to a new language is difficult because we're self taught and didn't go through years of higher education in C and Python and Java. Once we got comfortable with a flavor of AS we just didn't want to move. But didn't you learn a whole lot going from 2 to 3? Trust me, when you go back and see what people are doing with JavaScript it'll be a little painful at first but then you'll get over the hump and have that same enthusiasm for it that you did for AS3 and the reason will be because the JS community is on fire these days and they're making so much cool shit you'll quickly forget about being forced to live off the junk that Adobe produces.<p>And let's talk about that junk for a sec. Let's talk about Adobe as a whole and what they've become. Because I feel like at some point they totally lost their way and tried to turn the whole thing into some messed up flavor of Java. Case in point: text. For years we've struggled with getting the right fonts to show up on a page and getting text to flow properly. Their solution, after literally like a decade of us begging for it, was the Text Layout Framework. Rather than just enhancing the embed button they gave us the biggest pile of over engineered shit and to this day I've never seen a project that actually uses it. Adobe spends so much time building dumb features and tools that are totally half baked and then they basically hold a studio's hand to build a demo for MAX and then they waste a shitload of time trying to jam their way into some market and in the end I still can't get my fucking textfields to work and it's 2011.   I'm completely over being tied to the whims of that company because for them, it's all one big land grab and they're trying to get into every market possible. They're stretched, their features are watered down, and half the people in there have never done a real world project and are just applying their CS degrees to problems they don't actually understand.<p>Finally, I just want to say that we need to look forward to our future successes. Because right now each of us probably does not have a sparkling track record of amazing web apps or mobile apps that are not tied directly to the Flash platform. A friend of mine who has been doing Flash way longer than myself just recently launched an app that went to number 1 in the iOS store. He actually wrote it all in C++ but now he's really eager to learn Objective-C. I think this illustrates two points: 1) You don't have to do JavaScript if you don't want to. Learn Ruby or Python or Objective-C. Take this as an opportunity to broaden your horizons. You don't want to slooooowly sunset with a language and end up being the only COBOL guy left in the area code, so consider it a blessing that Flash is getting the rug pulled out from under it. 2) As soon as you start seeing success in a new language you will very quickly forget about Flash. It's kind of like getting into a new relationship. It sucks right now, but it won't always suck, and when it stops sucking it'll be awesome again.",1321124881

They are very consistent and easy to get used to.<p>Option (Alt) means ""word"". Opt+Left  move one word left, Opt+Right  move one word right.<p>Cmd means ""all"". Cmd+left  move to beginning of line, Cmd+right  move to the end of line, Cmd+up  move to the beginning of the text, Cmd+down  move to the end of text.<p>PgDown/PgUp/Home/End mean the same thing as in other systems, but without moving the cursor. All this might be a little frustrating at first, but it's muscle memory and you can figure the logic out in a couple of days. Don't fight the system, embrace it.<p>As for cmd+shift+g, you can look these shortcuts up in the menu, if you are not sure where to look, use help/search, type go to and the top item will be what you are thinking about. That said, finder still sucks.",1321124862

3228567,comment,3227620,3227620,8,0,davesims,,,"It seems that this course's curriculum centers on the hardware/algorithmic/mathematical level more than the semantics and ontology of modern object programming. The latter is much more philosophically interesting to me, and to me it's that side of things that gets closer to the pertinent philosophical questions that are raised by the dominance of computers in our society.<p>Also, no reference at all to the massive amount on The Philosophy of Technology written in the last hundred years? No Heidegger, Ellul, McLuhan?<p>It seems to me that abstract, domain-level programming concerns like object hierarchies are more essential than algorithms or binary math to the intersection between Computer Science and Philosophy. Once you get past the parallels between, say Philosophical Logic and Digital Logic (the first six weeks of both classes cover many of the same rules -- DeMorgan, etc.), I think the most pressing concerns are best addressed within the realm of the Humanities, Liberal Arts, and a broad Philosophical discourse.<p>The curriculum I'd like to see might have topics like:<p>* Christopher Alexander, Aristotle and the Gang of Four: Are Design Patterns Nominalist or Formalist/Realist in nature? (You could go for a while on this one. I'd love to see the GOF's appropriation of Alexander critiqued, and maybe brought into contact with the concerns raised in Heidegger's essay <i>The Question Concerning Technology</i>).<p>* Building, Dwelling, Coding<p>* The Question Concerning Technology Revisited: Are we now Standing Reserves of Information?<p>* Russell, Pierce, Saussure and the semantics of type systems<p>* Bergson and Agile -- the relationship between intuition and iterative process<p>Or something like that. You get the idea (or not...)",1321124854

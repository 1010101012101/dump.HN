It sounds like you have a password generation/management tool where it is easy to delete a valuable password before you&#x27;re done with it and with no way to get it back, which I would argue is probably a much more serious usability problem!<p>Ideally the change password process would be made clear for everyone and avoid the problem entirely, of course, and if we&#x27;re just talking about a simple old/new password form (I haven&#x27;t seen it) then surely that should be possible here. I&#x27;m not defending the status quo (again, I haven&#x27;t seen it).

7248705,comment,7245893,7245893,1,0,fredophile,,,"I&#x27;ve spent time on both sides of the interviewing table and I think there are some misconceptions in this thread. Generally an on site interview is the last in a series of steps for the candidate. They&#x27;ve already passed the early screening process and the company is investing serious resources in the recruiting process at this stage. Almost everything in an on site interview comes down to fit.<p>The point of whiteboard exercises isn&#x27;t to see how pretty your writing is or to make you stumble on brainteasers. It&#x27;s to see how you think. The real key is to think out loud as you go through the problem. How are you approaching it? Have you seen a similar problem before? Can you find an easier version of the problem and try to get some intuition (ex 2d vs 3d)? What do you do when you get stuck? Asking questions to clarify things is usually encouraged. If you&#x27;re nervous I&#x27;d recommend practice with thinking out loud while you solve problems. There are plenty of books full of interview level problems. Grab one and work through them while saying everything you think. Once you&#x27;re used to that do more with a friend pretending to be an interviewer. If you find yourself getting stuck a lot I&#x27;d recommend reading How to Solve It by Polya.<p>Sometimes you&#x27;ll be asked to write code on a whiteboard. This is really unnatural. The interviewers also know that it&#x27;s really unnatural. Unlike gcc whiteboard compiler is very forgiving. Usually people are looking for a couple of key things. Have you handled all of the corner cases? What about invalid inputs? Do you use reasonable variable names? Is your algorithm horribly inefficient?<p>There probably are companies that give brainteasers type questions too much weight. They heard places like Google and Facebook use them so they will too. I&#x27;d treat this as a red flag and not want to work there.<p>Unfortunately, there aren&#x27;t a lot of better options for interviewing. Any problems given have to be relatively trivial due to time constraints. I&#x27;ve had interviews where you sit and write a test or code at the start and the next step goes over your answers. The problem with this is that you have to leave the candidate doing nothing for 30-60 minutes while someone goes over what they wrote. Tests you do on your own also have limited value. They&#x27;re mostly useful as a low pass filter. They weed out the really bad candidates but can&#x27;t tell you much more than that.",1392577003

7248698,comment,7247690,7248235,5,0,Perseids,,,"To be honest I don&#x27;t buy his argument. If it is not about security, why not use md5? It is faster after all and gives you the same protection against accidental data corruption as sha1. And if he cared about security then he should have chosen sha256 or sha512, the latter of which is even faster than sha1 on 64bit systems [1] and can be truncated if you think it is too long.<p>And really there is no denying that git relies on the security of sha1, especially its second preimage resistance[2]. Otherwise all the signed Linux releases would be useless, because you could exchange the files in the release with your own, malicious ones. Even collision resistance is important, as if you are a rogue kernel developer you can craft two files with identical hashes: One that passes scrutiny upstream and one that has a subtle backdoor. If it is in one those binary blobs there is a very low chance of it ever being found.<p>My guess is that he did not really put more than 5 minutes of thought into the decision. He has a track record of mediocre understanding of and low regard for cryptographic topics, see for example: <a href=""http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1173350/focus=1173594"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1173350/focus=117...</a> .<p>[1] <a href=""http://bench.cr.yp.to/results-hash.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bench.cr.yp.to/results-hash.html</a><p>[2] You cannot find another file with the same hash as the given file.",1392576870

7248696,comment,7246178,7247697,1,0,aaronem,,,"The whole idea behind REST resources, though, is that the HTTP method expresses the action, and the URI identifies the object acted upon. In that conceptual scheme, there is neither need nor place for verbs in the URI; POST /topics/add is redundant, because POSTing to a collection already has the semantic value of &quot;add an item to this collection&quot;. Similarly, if you&#x27;re modifying an existing item, you don&#x27;t need to PUT /topics/23/edit or what-have-you; PUT already means &quot;replace the existing content with the request body I&#x27;m sending&quot;, so all else that&#x27;s required is to identify the particular content to replace, for which /topics/23 suffices. Having the HTTP method and the endpoint gives you all the clarity you need in terms of what a request does, and to which thing it does it.<p>An additional, and very non-trivial, benefit of this scheme is that it is standard and discoverable: &quot;standard&quot;, in the sense that these basic HTTP operations are defined in RFC 2616 and exhaustively documented there; &quot;discoverable&quot;, in the sense that knowing some endpoint represents a REST resource API instantly tells you quite a lot about how you can interact with it, and you can find out the rest from the responses you get when you make API requests -- which responses RFC 2616 also explains how to interpret.<p>Not everything is simple. REST resources are, and they need not have a complex API. Poorly thought-out APIs for simple things require a lot of documentation, that mostly being lousy explanations of the interactions between an incomplete set of edge and corner cases. Well thought-out APIs for simple things barely require any documentation at all.<p>The REST resource API is a sterling example of the latter sort; once you&#x27;re familiar with RFC 2616, you can discover everything else you need from the responses you get to API requests. This is not so when redundant verbs -- POST /topics/<i>add</i> -- are used in a backwards namespace --  POST <i>/add/topic</i> -- with uncertain naming -- /add/topic, so if I want all topics do I GET /topics or /topic, or /get/topics, or what? What makes all this confusion more worthwhile than just using REST resource endpoints? Do you want people who consume your API to curse your name for making them deal with a bunch of needless impedance matching, or to effortlessly retrieve what you&#x27;re offering and do something amazing with it?",1392576840

You may write new data, but you may never delete or overwrite data. How you design the database after that is up to you. The particular example I used is of course not going to be good for enforcing, say, uniqueness of email addresses across users.<p>It has tended to make me really consider the notion of uniqueness within a database. What does the unique constraint mean? I think that people think of uniqueness to mean &quot;at this point in time&quot;, but if you enforce it in the database, it means &quot;for all time.&quot; In relational algebra, the unique constraint is really about enforcing a candidate key, a field that could satisfactorily be used as a key, but we&#x27;ve so happened to have chosen a different field as the actual primary key. In that context, given that we would want someone to be able to change their email address, I don&#x27;t think &quot;unique&quot; email addresses make sense.<p>So many things change over time and so many seemingly &quot;unique&quot; fields turn out to not be unique in the real world that, for the most part, I&#x27;ve given up on the unique constraint. Full names are neither unique, nor are they final (people get married and change their name).

This doesn&#x27;t translate well once compiled with Emscripten, as bss relocation is on a per-variable basis. For one of the Quake 3 Fortress QVMs which was only a few hundred kb it output a ~50mb .bc file and a ~70mb .js file of mostly 0s.<p>I experimented with storing each segment as its own i8 array (which could be 0 initialized for the bss segment) in a packed struct, which significantly lowered the .bc file size. However, while I was looking into what I&#x27;d need to change in Emscripten to support this, I instead decided to go the route of writing the runtime compiler.<p>Fun fact: Quake 3 mods didn&#x27;t have access to malloc / free, so it wasn&#x27;t uncommon to have large amounts of static, 0 initialized data.",1392575176

We are registered in the UK (I&#x27;m not sure exactly what kind of entity we have there...a subsidiary, and agent, or something else) and all our EU sales are from our UK entity. The accountants said we should charge UK VAT rate to all customers, and we report and pay to the UK.<p>Note: I&#x27;m not sure exactly what our arrangement is in the UK.

But thanks for trying to paint me into a corner.<p>What I am saying is that the world is complicated and just because the robots can make enough stuff or grow enough food in a theoretical sense doesn&#x27;t mean that utopia is suddenly achieved.<p>>Lastly, I think your viewpoint is pretty evil honestly. So there is a robotic surplus sufficient to feed the world multiple times over in this scenario and people still starve because fuck you I own the robots and I&#x27;m only going to help myself? If that&#x27;s the world there will be a revolution and I&#x27;ll be on the side of the dirty hippies.<p>You don&#x27;t even know what my viewpoint is so I don&#x27;t see how you can characterize it as evil!  I can&#x27;t believe how quickly this turned into &quot;you must be a dirty libertarian so fuck you!&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t particularly LIKE taxes and a world where taxes magically didn&#x27;t have to exist but I still got to use roads and schools and fire departments and police and stuff, I&#x27;d be OK with that.  But since none of those people work for free, I accept taxes as necessary even if not my favorite.<p>> then the government can tax the robots productivity at 10% to achieve the same thing.<p>OK what you just said there is that the government is going to take all the useful output of the robots and leave the owners with no useful output.  If the robots can produce 10x whats needed and the government takes the first 1x then what the owners of the robots do with the other 9x?  Nobody needs the other 9x, so by definition they couldn&#x27;t sell it.<p>Disagree with me?  OK great, I want to sell you a million liters of air at 1ATM for $0.001 per liter.  Wait, you already have more than enough air?  And everyone else does too?  Fuck who is going to buy this air so that I can make good on my investment?!?!<p>If the robots were going to be taxed at 10% of productivity you&#x27;d basically see the total robot workforce get reduced by 90%.  If you spend a billion dollars on a factory you need to get your money back and if you can&#x27;t sell the excess capacity then you&#x27;re going broke.<p>The best scenario I can think of is that the robots become so cheap that eventually everyone becomes largely self-sufficient.  But even then you&#x27;ll still have problems because of land ownership; if you can make everything you need just so long as you have access to land then the price of land will go way, way up.<p>Maybe once you get to space everyone can have as much of whatever that they need and we can achieve rough approximations of utopia but maybe not.  Maybe once we get to space everyone wants their own 500 ft luxury spaceliner and there&#x27;s not enough raw materials to go around.<p>I think part of the problem is that human desires are basically unlimited.  Maybe not everyone has infinite ability to consume, but the human race, collectively, could consume nearly infinite amounts of anything.  So any attempt to imagine &quot;well what happens in the future when we can easily satisfy everyone&#x27;s current desires&quot; accidentally ignores the idea that in the future people will probably have desires that are bigger than they are today.<p>There was a time when many people shared a large single room house in Europe in the middle ages.  Then someone invented the fireplace and the nobility gave themselves their own rooms.  Eventually it became common for everyone to have their own room.  Then, everyone has their own house/condo/apartment though sometimes shared between several generations.  Now in the US it&#x27;s quite common for a single person of 25 to have their own 1BD apartment or even a whole house.  500 years ago you&#x27;d have to have been filthy rich to have that.  Today it&#x27;s possible for someone with a high school diploma and knowledge of a skilled trade to afford it.<p>500 years from today I agree that meeting everyone&#x27;s current demands will probably be a joke and the robots will be able to do it all.  But what new desires will human beings have that we can&#x27;t even imagine right now?  I&#x27;m not saying that a Star Trek economy could never exist, but that I don&#x27;t foresee it happening do to the fact that human nature will probably be the same.",1392573647

I have had either a laptop or desktop with Linux installed (Ubuntu, Gentoo and DSL) since 2003/4 and spend just as much time customizing it as my Mac or Windows installations. I actually <i>save</i> time in the long run, because of the magic of apt-get.<p>Everbody gives this logic, but I've installed Linux on plenty for non-techies, and they have no problems--at least, not more than they would have had.<p>(One of my laptops, for the life of me, would not hook up to an external monitor.

There is usually less play in a thumb throttle, so external factors are more likely to have a larger influence than they would on a twist grip.<p>A thumb throttle is also more likely to accidentally slip to 0% than a full handlebar. With motorcycles, suddenly losing all power can be just as if not more dangerous than too much power. If you're not prepared, the rear wheel can lock up and cause you to lose control of the bike. It's very dangerous because you lose all steering, and if the tire engages while they aren't lined up with the direction of travel, the bike will flip, usually throwing you in front of it.",1250581868

769976,story,,,1,1,studentx,"Ask HN: OPT vs H1B for developers",,"I'm in a bit of a pickle. I got my undergrad degree in the US as an international student, and as I was graduating this year, I accepted an offer from a grad school. But one way or another, I have come to regret this decision and would like to try to get a full time position instead (currently an intern and have good intern experience and am a strong college hire level candidate in general). Currently, I still have lots of OPT time which I will lose either two months from now or as soon as I begin grad school in September. So if I start grad school, I can still apply for work, but I'd need H1B sponsorship, which will make it harder to get a job I like.<p>If you're a developer or have hired for your company, does OPT time (15-27 months available) make it that much easier to get hired? H1B's might hit the cap again next year. Do you think spending the two months interviewing would be a risk that's worth taking? Or play it safe, begin grad school and avoid having to leave the country?",1250581270

769948,comment,769502,769531,0,0,gdee,,,"Nah, I think that article is posed wrong. They compare smoking the electronic cigs to not smoking at all. Of course not smoking is better. Much much better. But by blocking them from the market they are denying another use case. For people that already smoke tobacco. I don't know if you smoke tobacco and if so, if you tried ecigs. I do, and I have. And smoking ecigs is much much much better although in a ""lesser evil"" manner. The e-liquid (what gets vaporized in ecigs) manufacturers should, I believe, purposefully try and try pretty hard to mach the level of toxins and carcinogens in common cigarettes. They don't.
What is readily perceivable is to a net BIG gain. I have used these devices for about 3 months last year. They were wonderful. I would ABSOLUTELY prefer them to regular cigarettes even if they would not have a wonderful potential for quitting smoking altogether which I strongly believe (with arguments) they do. Outright denying that opportunity should be considered criminal in my humble opinion.",1250579309

Doesn't the fact that it burst by definition mean that most people did not recognize it?""<p>Some data, some math, and an interpretation you won't hear every day:<p><a href=""http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html</a><p><a href=""http://photos1.blogger.com/photoInclude/x/blogger/2825/754/1600/212275/EHSannual.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://photos1.blogger.com/photoInclude/x/blogger/2825/754/1...</a><p>There are 127 million housing units in the U.S.  At the peak of the bubble, 7 million houses/year were sold.  A total of roughly 30 million houses were sold in the boom years of 2002-2007, <i>assuming</i> there's no double-counting (people who sold a house multiple times), which is probably a pessimistic assumption.  That means that over <i>half</i> of U.S. households took absolutely no part in the bubble - they just sat tight.<p>Now look at the inventory numbers from the last two years.  They go up rather dramatically.  This means there were more sellers than buyers, i.e. a large number of people realized that home prices were selling for more than they thought the house was worth, and quickly put their house on the market to take advantage of this.  Sure looks like people recognized the bubble to me, it's just that <i>by definition</i> they can't all get out before it bursts.<p>My interpretation is that <i>most</i> people <i>did</i> recognize the bubble - it's just that they're not the ones that the New York Times writes stories about.  They held onto their home and neither bought nor sold, instead just going about their business.  Or they sold at the peak, rented for a bit, and are now buying back in at half price and pocketing a few hundred grand.  Smart people tend not to brag about how they just made a killing off other people's stupidity.  It prevents people from being stupid again, which limits the opportunities for future killings.  Besides, it tends to kill the mood at parties.",1250579189

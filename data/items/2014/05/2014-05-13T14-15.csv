7738441,comment,7737061,7738270,18,0,regoldste,,,"You make a good argument about why she has an interest in not being found/identified with this information. To be sure, there are good reasons why she would want to distance herself from this event in her life. By the way, that is the reason that many newspapers (e.g., the NYTimes)have policies against reporting the names of rape victims, precisely because of the stigmatic effects on the victim.<p>But why is her interest in privacy sufficient to create a right protected by the law? What about the conflicting interests--including existing legal rights--of others to learn about and to publish that information? What concerns me the most is the unimaginably fraught task of administrating these rights. The EU Court suggested a highly problematic standard: data that is &quot;inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant&quot; must be deleted upon request. Who decides what is adequate and relevant? Relevant to whom, and for what? Adequate for what?  Is relevance now the standard for what information can exist online? Who is the arbiter of relevance?<p>And how is this administered as a technical matter? Does Google delete the entire article, or just redact the sensitive information? What if there is other important information in that same article/site/page? Does the public now lose access to the entire article, which surely contains other useful information?<p>This policy seems extremely ill-advised.",1399993164

7738436,comment,7737364,7737818,2,0,grey-area,,,"I really disagree with you that Git is not a good tool for designers. It&#x27;s certainly not friendly to learn, but for designers who get the process, it is incredibly useful. If you have lots of 900MB binary blobs I guess that&#x27;s going to be a problem, but the vast majority of assets in a website or app are text files, jpg and png files which are small, and the vector artwork or PSDs used to generate them (for vector that&#x27;s really small, for psds that can vary from a few MB up to 100MB (which git is perfectly fine with), but 900MB is in my experience really rare). Photoshop is just one tool in the arsenal, and not particularly effective for anything involving text (the layout tools aren&#x27;t great), anything which will be translated to html (just mock up in HTML/CSS after some quick roughs - far less friction), or anything which requires resolution independence (almost every asset nowadays).<p>Of course this depends on workflow and tastes vary, but for designers who don&#x27;t use PSD to actually design websites (a purpose for which it is not very well suited), git or other version control tools are incredibly useful. Wasting a bit of extra space storing a few versions of a psd file is no problem - I&#x27;ve worked on 20GB local repositories before with a lot of assets, without issues, and it&#x27;s easy enough to separate out large files into another repo or leave them out of version control if you have to. If a designer is creating 1GB PSD files with hundreds of assets in, I&#x27;d say (as a designer) their workflow is fundamentally broken unless they are producing billboard advertisements which require very high resolution files - you shouldn&#x27;t have that much of anything glommed together in one file. So git works perfectly fine for lots of designers today, even working with binary files.<p>It&#x27;s just a shame that these version control tools are mostly isolated to the workflow of programmers, as people at most workplaces I&#x27;ve come into contact with, from architects through writers or editors, sorely need a tool like git in order to manage collaboration and versions.",1399993131

They&#x27;re going to be too costly to extract, to rare to utilize, and/or too harmful to the environment.  Take your pick.  It&#x27;s not as if there&#x27;s a choice.<p>Secondly:  the question isn&#x27;t &quot;how much fossil fuels&quot;, but &quot;how much energy&quot;  EROEI (energy returned on energy invested) is what makes the economy tick, and it&#x27;s almost certainly the most significant factor in the economic growth and expansion of the past 250 years or so.<p>Absent the energy surpluses provided by fossil fuels, yeah, we&#x27;ll likely be doing less.<p>As for what it takes to make ships -- electrical energy (from renewable sources) can substitute for much fossil fuel use.  Coking for steel is an exception, though that can come from where it did initially:  charcoal.  Or synthesized coke.  Mind that exhaustion of forests for both lumber and fuel was among the key reasons England turned to, first seacoal, shortly after mined coal, as its energy needs grew.<p>And there&#x27;s no guarantee that the Universe is going to provide humans with the energy we&#x27;ve become accustomed to.",1399993029

I made my first million before I turned 30 and have multiplied that a few times over in the next few years doing pretty much the same thing. There was no one event that dropped a bunch of cash in my lap. I accumulated ( and continue to accumulate ) cash ( at an increasing rate --- snowball effects are amazing ) over time. Still cranking away.....<p>Best advice I can give for those who want to accumulate wealth. Find something you enjoy, can reward you well financially, and then grind it out for a decade. The last part isn&#x27;t talked about that much because, well its generally not all that glamorous --- but I enjoyed it.",1399991903

Interconnects are the entire story here.<p>The media has framed a lot of the congestion issues in the context of &quot;fast/slow lane&quot; but what they come down to are business disagreements between the transit providers and the ISPs. The solution to these disagreements from the viewpoint of a large service provider is to purchase an interconnect directly to the ISPs. If you are a small service provider, the solution is to purchase delivery through a CDN. Netflix used to purchase delivery through CDNs until it got too expensive for their business model; so they started building their own CDN that they called &quot;OpenConnect&quot;. They used their positive brand image in conjunction with the ISP&#x27;s poor brand image to launch a PR campaign with the goal of knocking down the price they would have to pay for interconnect service. It worked; they knew they were always going to have to pay the Comcasts and Verizons of the world but they were able to talk the ISPs down a significant amount.<p>Strategically, it&#x27;s a bad position to be in for a service provider because the ISPs can raise the price at any time (which is why Netflix has continued complaining about it). But realistically, the ISPs sit on such a strong market control point that nothing can really stop them from setting prices (common carrier status just means they have to offer the same price structure to everyone; not that they can&#x27;t arbitrarily raise prices).",1399991494

Bob pleads not guilty and Alice participates in the trial as a witness. Bob is sentenced, the court record is made. The Daily News (fictional paper) reports on the court records of the day and has a reporter who attends the more interesting cases, and mentions Bob&#x27;s sentence and gives some of Alice&#x27;s statements as quotes.<p>In that scenario, the court record should always be a matter of public record, a statement of fact. The newspaper certainly has the right to access public record and to make a news story of the set of facts that are in the public record.<p>But, here starts the problems... Alice applies for a job and the employer Googles her name and comes across the news article. There are many types of crimes in which the public have great difficulty accepting a victim is a victim. For example, rape. It isn&#x27;t too much of a stretch to say that the culture of victim blaming means that a matter of public record has just had the effect of defaming Alice.<p>Alice as a victim is never given the opportunity to move on with her life when every person that ever searches for her will find the story very quickly. She has been sentenced too by participating in the justice system, which is an open book.<p>The newspaper, just as in this case, will argue this is public record and cannot be silenced. Sure, I agree... but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s in the victims interest that the information be extraordinarily easy to find.<p>And Google are a better place in which to attempt to stop the information being found, given that they (and only 1 or 2 other search engines) cover the vast majority of searches made about someone.<p>Alice certainly does have the right to make information that she didn&#x27;t explicitly choose to make public and that can cause her harm not be found so easily, even when that information is a matter of fact and public record.<p>She has the right to not be found (by that method - Google).<p>PS: I know a girl experiencing almost <i>exactly</i> that scenario, who cannot get a news story off of the front page results for her name.

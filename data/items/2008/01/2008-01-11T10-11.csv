Many startups make money by providing services directly to users.<p>Thanks for getting the ball rolling in any case, this is neat info to gather.",1200049024

A 1mbit line and an uncapped-shaped account is more than $200 a month.<p>Most people have 512mbit, our ""broadband,"" on a 3GB account and that'll set you back just less that $100 per month.",1200048797

(Sorry don't remember who it was.)<p>But it is really a newspaper conspiracy, as the story claims? My impression is that World War II outshines the whole rest of British history. The British are incredibly proud that they stood up to the Nazis, and who can deny they were on the good side in a huge and unusually clear case of ""good against evil"".",1200048381

The headline ""High school dropout becomes Goldman Sachs chairman"" surprises us because of our current ideas of what being a high school drop-out entails; but times have changed over the past century.<p>Translating to a credential which is comparably scarce right now, we should read this headline as we would read ""MBA dropout becomes Goldman Sachs chairman"" (currently about 9% of students obtain some form of Masters degree), which might be anomalous, but is hardly a shocking notion.",1200046715

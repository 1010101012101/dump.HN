You absolutely have to focus. You've got a <i>gun to your head</i> requiring focus, commanding the basic flow of the application fit tidily within the confines of this small space, this teensy viewport the user has into what they're working on. Now, it's still possible to make crap (definitely) but the kinds of mistakes you're able to make are limited by both space and what the user can realistically accomplish with the limited time and tools inherent to the phone form factor.<p>Now. You get to tablet land. Holy shit! Look at all this room. I can put things here, and over here, and this place is nice  and then you have this jumbled, unfocussed mess. For me, the tablet gives you a lot of rope to hang yourself. Since the form factor isn't compelling focus and clarity, now you have to do it yourself.<p>I love the luxury of creative constraints. Tablets just have fewer constraints. A blessing and a curse, to be certain. Lots of great stuff you can only do on a tablet, too.",1308596124

I'm arguing that this extra amount of time will not be worth the difference in price.</i><p>Yes, I get that.  I just don't agree, and presumably he doesn't either.<p><i>It's not just collaboration and web stuff, it's reliability and security. Would you seriously trust a tiny service like CodePlane to store your code? Both ensuring it won't be deleted and that it won't be hacked into? If DropBox has trouble with those issues, would you trust a low-budget one-man-operation with your 50 repos?</i><p>And GitHub started as... what, exactly?  A tiny low-budget one-man operation?  Everybody's gotta start somewhere.  Maybe CodePlane doesn't meet your reliability and security requirements today, but there's nothing saying it won't in 3-6 months.<p>And regardless, this is Git we're talking about.  Every repository clone is a full backup.  If you're still concerned, add a post-commit hook that also pushes to another server you control, or set up a cron job that does rsync every now and then.  I'd do the <i>exact</i> same thing on GitHub as well -- why would you trust GitHub to never have an issue that might render their backups useless?  It's certainly not the first time this has happened to a service that does their own backups.  If there's data you really care about, you <i>must</i> maintain your own backups.  At the very least use an online backup solution (or something like Dropbox).  Maybe not something you control, but at least it's pretty unlikely that both services would fail at the same time.<p><i>When people evaluate programmers they often have to rely on far-from-perfect metrics, like university credentials. Putting emphasis on GitHub and ignoring the other forges is not ideal, but it's such a big improvement over the old ways. It's hard to get new metrics accepted into the mainstream.</i><p>Yeah, that's true.  That was more of a mini-rant on my part than an endorsement of anything non-GitHub.",1308595914

I went back to freelancing/self-employed about 5 years ago following 7 years of being in a full-time job. At the time it was primarily motivated by the rates I'd seen advertised for roles similar to what I was already doing, with grand plans of building a team of other contractors that I'd farm work out to and skim a % off the top and ultimately build a successful dev shop of my own. I quickly realised the economics and scale required to make that happen, so instead focussed on just making sure I had enough work to keep myself busy. What I've realised in that time is:<p>* Demand definitely exceeds supply at the moment. I've constantly had more paying work than I have time available to do it.<p>* We (developers) get paid stupidly good for what we do. Not movie star/sports person good, but still pretty amazing given there is very little risk to our health and much of it can be self taught.<p>* Primarily chasing the money is almost always destined to end in disaster.<p>I spent the better part of 3 years working with Stephen (the author of the linked blog) for a client. Almost everyone there was self-employed, and most had been there for longer than I had. I was definitely getting paid below market rates, but I stayed there for that long because:<p>* They were honest and open about everything in the business, I never felt like I was being screwed over or that my contribution was undervalued.<p>* The working environment was flexible, I had Monday's off (which as a contractor is actually another 20% hit on your weekly rate), and my performance was measured by delivering rather than face-time and adherence to a schedule.<p>* It was just a generally great place to be.<p>I've since worked for clients where the environment has been just the opposite. The worst places have always been the highest paying, they've always been cashflow rich and figure money can solve all their problems. If I've had any complaints about the way things were done and said I was leaving, they'd throw more money at me. I'd justify accepting it at the time, and then start to feel dirty about the fact you're just whoring yourself out. I can't be the only one to have conclusion, the fact I've worked with so many talented people happily earning less than their potential I think confirms that.<p>Because lets be honest, I could be earning 50% of what ""market rates"" are these days and still be a hell of a long way from the poverty line.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that while great developers might be rare, I think great developers that are primarily motivated by their daily rate are even rarer. If you (as an employer) are aware that all your employees, whether they are contractors or not, might leave at any moment if you're not offering them an enjoyable place to work... well then I think you're half way there. Then build it, and they will come :)",1308594138

In contrast, when the Department of Justice tried to subpoena two months worth of user queries, Google resisted that challenge and won in court.

(As I already said in another comment.)<p>But here's why some people probably don't like personalization: It's invisible. There is nothing on the results page that tells you whether your results are personalized or not. Sure, you can look at whether the browser is in incognito mode or you can look for some parameter in the URL, but these things require that you already know about personalization.<p>In contrast to personalization there are various indicators that a page is localized. The most prominent is obviously the language of the text. As soon as all the search results are in my local language it is very obvious to me that I got localized search results. I can also detect localization by looking at the Google logo on the homepage (localized versions have the country name in grey text below the Google logo), by looking at the language of the Google interface, by remembering the domain name I used to access Google and by looking at the sidebar on the left that even displays a guess of my location on the city-level.<p>There are no such indicators at all for filtered/personalized results. Every user around me starts with the same version of Google results. That's how everyone got acquainted with Google in the beginning. Same results for everyone. There is no reason for a user to question that until you see the differences by comparing search results, which most users won't. Someone who doesn't happen to work at Google or didn't hear about the ""filter bubble"" can't know that search results will start to diverge from vanilla results over time.<p>So personalized Google results violate the principle of least astonishment.<p>While I can't speak for other people, I think that the concerns that some people have about this are rooted in the fact that you can get trapped in some sort of feedback loop without ever knowing. If you could see that your results are personalized you could compare them to unpersonalized results and decide for yourself which you like better.",1308592873

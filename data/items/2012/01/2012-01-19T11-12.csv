I can think of several off-hand.<p>1)  Picking a true cross-platform stack or technologies.  (In the desktop, an example would be creating a Python app with a cross-platform widgets library.  A more common example is doing everything through the browser).<p>2)  Port.  Complete development of the version with better expected returns first (e.g. iOS) and then port the version (or have a porting team do it, while the original team is continuing development on the next version, and after that's done that gets ported).  This reminds me of desktop apps that targeted Windows first and then had a team prepare a Mac version.  These days it becomes less and less clear what ""one"" platform to target first.<p>3) ifdef type ""cross-platform"" hell.  Maybe the code base should be in a single ""cross-platform"" branch, and every feature should be added incrementally such that it is only committed when it works on every platform.  Is this even possible between iOS and Android?<p>4) parallel development.  There is no porting, just two teams, an iOS team and an Android team, and they don't communicate much, except for working from the same requirements.<p>5) a core functionality team that makes something multiplatform, and then has the code-base finished by an iOS and Android team respectively?  The why-Microsoft-didn't-port-SQL-Server-to-Unix article linked here a few days ago mentions this:
""For example, do you follow a philosophy that says the core team just worries about Windows and throws the Windows product over the wall to a team that adapts it to *nix?  Or do you reorganize everything so you have a core team that builds multi-platform software and then teams that adapt it to the various platforms (which is what true multi-platform companies do)?""<p>http://hal2020.com/2011/07/27/porting-microsoft-sql-server-to-linux/<p>It seems that although desktop software is becoming less relevant, native mobile apps are as relevant as ever.  What are your best experiences of substantial multi-platform iOS and Android development?  Or native Mac and Windows software for that matter!<p>I am especially looking for high-level strategies that will scale to larger teams while continuing to target both iOS and Android, so if you have advice on how to start out small while targeting both these platforms, with an expectation to grow the team(s) substantially, I'd love to hear it!",1326973858

Apparently he recovered from his depression within a week after after his session.<p>Obviously I'm not claiming this happens with all patients (it's taken me 4.5 months to move from ""severe depression"" on the BDC to ""normal but unhappy""), but I don't understand why you're so convinced the poster wasn't suffering from a real and debilitating condition that - from his description of it - significantly decreased the quality of his life.<p>I'd also like to suggest the possibility that the OP may not have recovered at all, but have simply found some temporary respite.

So, whereas in general it's undecidable whether a program completes (the Halting problem) if it's written in a turing complete language, for the case of HTML+CSS it may well be decidable for several reasons.  Firstly; because the HTML file will be of limited (and in practice small) size, and secondly, because the interesting question is whether you can reason about the state _now_; not whether the document might reach arbitrarily many states were the user to perform infinitely many interactions.<p>Turing completeness makes hard to reason about a program; and indeed the weaker a language the easier it can be to reason about it - or, more practically - the easier it can be for the browser to determine boundary conditions and to simplify interpretation of the page.

That's entirely beside the point however; the point is that I can evaluate a _given_ FSA without turing completeness, not that an arbitrarily large FSA might take arbitrarily many execution resources (I mean, well duh).<p>Any given HTML+CSS combo is thus bounded in two ways; both by its own size, and by the fact that I don't care about eventual possible states reachable after infinite user interaction but just about the current state (or states very close to the current state).",1326973334

3484025,comment,3483882,3483882,10,0,dasil003,,,"Great article.  Aside from the fact that being approached by someone ""looking for a co-founder"" is a turn-off (on par with being approached by someone looking for a spouse), it's also not a good sign of a successful entrepreneur.  The successful entrepreneur archetype will be executing at all stages.  If they believe that the lynchpin is an external person that will make it magically come together then they probably don't have the chops to make it through all the challenges that startups inevitably face.  This is distinctly different from hiring an engineer, or meeting someone who shares passion and applicable skills for your idea.<p>As far as swinging for the fences goes, I believe that is a middle stage decision.  When you have some traction, you are potentially faced with difficult choices about whether to ""sell out"" or not.  If you are just starting out and you decide you are ""going to be the next Google"" that is just pie-in-the-sky dreaming, not swinging for the fences.  If you want to be an Apple, Google or Amazon you will need to build it up over the course of decades through a series of successful pivots to scale up.  Facebook is the most recent example, where the entire momentum of the site was imparted from the exclusivity of a truly tiny market (Harvard students), and then pivoting pivoting to progressively wider markets.  For any of these companies the risks are incredible at each pivot, so swinging for the fences is more akin to building 5 startups in a row successfully.  The only way you're going to get there is by building one regular small startup first and then repeatedly taking it to the next level from there.  I don't think it's any different for YC startups other than that they start out with better connections, but that does not a business model make.",1326972697

I'm not at the burnout phase, but maybe it's taking longer and will consequently be a more spectacular breakdown. I feel myself getting to closer to the edge every day.<p>My life situation: I have a full time day job at a small business of 18 employees as their IT director. I fight fires all day and help them dig out of constant deadline pressures. Oh, and I have my own responsibilities and we have 'initiatives' that we're accountable to which are supposed to be outside of work.<p>It's been too much for awhile - nearly 2 years. A year ago I started diversifying so I had something to fall back on. I took on a large side project where I'm the sole developer. It was with a longtime moonlighting client of mine who has high expectations of quality and time. I would love to subcontract the development but I'm afraid that it will take more of my time to get started and the cost/quality won't be  high enough.<p>I wake up at 5am, do my moonlighting until about 7am. Help get my 8month old ready for the day and off to daycare. I then still can maintain a workout (30 minutes a day 6 days a week for 5 years straight), and then get to my day job. I'm there until about 6, come home spend a few hour with my daughter and wife and then feel compelled to dig out of the 20 emails I get from my coworkers while I'm disconnected. After that I try to make progress on my moonlighting gig until about 10pm.<p>My weekends are the same way.<p>Is this a good way to live? No.<p>I fool myself into thinking that it's just one more project or one more deadline then the pressure is off. Another one immediately follows. Occasionally, I'll slip into needing to have a few beers while working to take the edge off - to just get through it. Also not good. I'm probably developing some form of RSI because my pinkies and wrist hurt as I type this.<p>So, I'm suffering. On the other side, my wife just quit her job, we're renting in a new city with a house for sale (mortgage already paid off though) in another. We have at least 60 months of savings and another 40 if/when the house sells. Need insurance though so I can't quit and have no idea what it would take to self-insure. Also, don't want to eat away at that rainy day fund now that I have a daughter to take care of.<p>What's the solution? I tell myself I'll finish up this side project and that'll be it.

He'll tell tales of spending a day in the studio sampling a snare drum sound. One day, one snare drum sound. Given the cost of studio time that's just obscene.<p>Now maybe that's what the highest production standards demand, but I think we need to view the $500,000 album and the $500,000 video as a luxury, not the norm. If those costs come down (and that's perfectly realistic) then the maths potentially looks very different.<p>The issue here is (surprise surprise) most likely with the record company. After all the better the production the more likely the record is to sell (arguable but it's probably not going to hurt) and the record company don't care whether the money goes to the band or to the studio / producer.<p>But bands do need to take some responsibility for how THEIR money is spent.

If that's the case then bands need to argue for more control rather than just more money as money seems to be pointless without it.<p>Makes me think about the contract the Wedding Present signed when they moved to a major label. They gave up a load of cash to have complete control over studio, producer, artwork and so on and if the label didn't like the resulting record, to be able to take it to someone else.

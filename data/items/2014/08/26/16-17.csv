I&#x27;ll try to answer them below:<p>1) Traditional microfinance services you are referring to have intermediaries (ground forces) to help them with loan disbursement, background check, loan recovery etc.. Zidisha is the first service to take everything online and that&#x27;s why the interest rate is substantially lower. But it comes with a risk of low repayment rates. Repayment rate number was ~ 80% range last year and has gone up to ~90% after lots of process improvement.

But I&#x27;m going to do it anyway.  I just don&#x27;t see the “elegance” in this library and I see several problems with this library that make it unsuitable for production use.  Examples:<p>This library provides access to a singleton database.  Did you want to choose the location of your database?  Sorry, it&#x27;s going to be “SwiftData.sqlite” in your app&#x27;s Documents folder (if sandbox) or the user&#x27;s “Documents” folder (if not sandboxed).  Did you want to use a SQLite3 database as your document storage format, and let the user have multiple documents open simultaneously?  Sorry, not with this library.<p>This library doesn&#x27;t use prepared statements.  When you give it SQL with bind placeholders and substitution values, it creates a new string that embeds the values.  Does your SQL statement have a string literal containing a `?`?  Sorry, this library will treat it as a bind placeholder anyway.  (Example: the ? here is not a placeholder: insert into x values (&#x27;?&#x27;))  Did you want to use less error-prone named placeholders, which SQLite3 supports natively?  Sorry, not with this library.<p>This library loads the entire result set of a query into an array and returns it to you.  Did you want to reduce your memory footprint?  Sorry, not with this library.<p>The library source code is full of copy-pasted code that should be unified.<p>Every enumeration case in the standard library (c.f. Bit, Character, FloatingPointClassification, ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional, MirrorDisposition, Optional, QuickLookObject, UnicodeDecodingResult) starts with a capital letter.  This library&#x27;s enumeration cases (c.f. DataType, Flags) start with lower case letters.",1409072132

8228194,comment,8226139,8228043,2,0,vertex-four,,,"> To learn Nix you need to learn both how to write shell scripts and how to write Nix expressions. How is that better than just learning Scheme, which is very trivial to learn the basics - and for most packages, you don&#x27;t really need to learn much because you can reference other packages - it&#x27;s really just like a configuration file.<p>Except that as a Linux admin, you probably already know how to write shell scripts anyway, and you&#x27;d be rather hard-pressed to manage a Linux system while never once having to write or read one. There&#x27;s also a lot more information on writing shell scripts than Guile scripts for various common purposes.<p>> scheme is the only language you&#x27;ll need to be able to fully drive your OS.<p>With a different DSL for each use, meaning you have to learn the restrictions of each DSL anyway.<p>> You can do anything from the shell too (which nixpkg can invoke) - you can even invoke guile from a shell script.<p>That&#x27;s true, although in Nix&#x27;s case, the derivations map directly to the source, as Nix code itself can&#x27;t call out to anything (only return derivations which might) - and in theory, the build could then happen in a sandbox, making it even more likely that the result would be the same.<p>We might not have reproducible builds yet, but Nix is closer to having them than Guix if somebody wanted to make a research project out of it.",1409071864

The average rate chosen by lenders is around 5.5% per year, but there&#x27;s a lot of variation, as borrowers with the longest positive repayment histories tend to attract lower interest rates.<p>Yes, this is true direct lending.  In fact it&#x27;s more direct than Kiva Zip, because the latter uses local organizations called &quot;trustees&quot; to help vet borrowers, and the trustees frequently post content in place of the borrower, especially outside the US.  Zidisha does not use trustees or any other intermediary, and the content in the loan profile pages is written directly by the borrowers. You can view a sampling of the sort of comments our borrowers post here: <a href=""https://www.zidisha.org/microfinance/testimonials.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.zidisha.org/microfinance/testimonials.html</a>.<p>Our best recourse against default is prevention, as it is very hard to collect a loan once it has become delinquent.  Most of our credit risk protection happens at the application stage: things like a referral program that incentivizes borrowers to invite only trustworthy acquaintances to join Zidisha, machine learning tools to detect fraudulent accounts, and a credit limit progression system that incentivizes members to maintain high on-time repayment rates.<p>We spend a lot of time on fraud protection, but the most frequent cause of default at Zidisha is simple financial hardship.  We&#x27;re lending to a demographic whose income is not only low but also erratic, and lacks substantial savings, insurance or government safety nets.  A big part of our credit risk protection is recognizing that reality and accommodating it through mechanisms like allowing borrowers to choose their own repayment schedules and adjust their installment amounts up or down to adapt to their financial situation.",1409071687

How is that better than just learning Scheme, which is very trivial to learn the basics - and for most packages, you don&#x27;t really need to learn much because you can reference other packages - it&#x27;s really just like a configuration file.<p>One of the goals of GNU is to really make Guile ubiquitous - used for configuration of packages, build processes, service configuration (via DMD) and software configuration/extension. There should be no need to learn dozens of different configuration formats and languages, scheme is the only language you&#x27;ll need to be able to fully drive your OS. (Well, perhaps not strictly true, you&#x27;ll probably still need to use the shell, but you&#x27;d preferably write guile scripts rather than plain bash).<p>> My understanding (and it seems the understanding of several other people) is that while Guix uses the Nix daemon and thus derivations (and thus build processes) are pure once generated, the process for generating them from the Scheme code is not guaranteed to be so, given that the Scheme code can do practically anything.<p>You can do anything from the shell too (which nixpkg can invoke) - you can even invoke guile from a shell script. The guarantee given by both systems is that the build happens in an isolated environment (via chroot), and it doesn&#x27;t matter what general purpose computation happens inside the environment.<p>Neither Nix nor Guix make guarantees about the resulting binary from a build process - we do not yet have reproducible builds[<a href=""https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds</a>]. The only guarantees made by both PMs is that packages have an identity which is a hash of their source, dependencies and build instructions. Changing the build instructions results in a new derivation, so unless you have some crazy package that deliberately tries to make itself non-reproducible, you should get approximately/functionally identical binaries from building, even if they are not bit-exact. Obviously we&#x27;d like ReproducibleBuilds in both systems, to be able to authenticate the actual build via its hash.",1409070468

8228039,comment,8222274,8222274,1,0,frobozz,,,"> A first step would be to revise our attitude toward immigration in cities. Instead of seeing immigrants as aliens, we should welcome their fresh perspectives, their wealth of new cultural traditions — and yes, their cash infusions.<p>London has a long history of welcoming immigration, and is currently extremely welcoming of wealthy immigrants in particular.  Housing density is always rising.  New buildings are always going up, and existing buildings are frequently being turned into flats.  This welcoming behaviour has done nothing to prevent even reasonably well-off natives being priced out of the city.<p>> The only crime is in sacrificing one to make way for the other.<p>There&#x27;s no real suggestion here.  How does one avoid this sacrifice?<p>Builders of new flats in London are required to offset their luxury accommodation with some &quot;affordable housing&quot;, as an attempt to prevent this sacrifice.  This has not yet worked.  Not-so-wealthy immigrants to London find themselves either in substandard housing, or just not-very-good housing in the outer zones.  Natives find themselves living with their parents until they&#x27;re 40, or leaving the city altogether.<p>I would say that the only way to ensure that gentrification has a positive effect for all involved is to be more welcoming of actual immigration, but less welcoming to cash-only immigration.  The rental and flipping markets are out of control. There is a surplus of big-money cash buyers pricing those on normal incomes out of the homebuying market, whilst charging ever-increasing rents to their tenants (which further reduces said tenants&#x27; abilities to escape the rental market, and eventually forces them out to make way for wealthier tenants).<p>Tipping the balance in favour of renters rather than lessors would help this. Rent controls; making eviction harder; preventing homebuying by non-residents; increased taxes on empty properties. All these would slow house price rises and allow people who don&#x27;t own a Russian utility company to stay in London for longer.",1409070435

The protests of Aryan women against the internment of their Jewish husbands had shown open dissent to the Nazi program and for Goebbels (with Hitler’s approval), it was more important to eliminate this dissent by releasing those Jews than to allow such dissent to be visible to other Germans or international bodies.

I think that makes Guix more consistent in its programming style.<p>On the other hand, in order to write a Guix build script, you have to know Scheme (and whatever libraries Guix provides for this task) rather than utilising your existing knowledge of writing shell scripts.<p>> Guix has this same certainty because it uses the Nix daemon, and the defaults are a bit stricter than Nix.<p>Really? So you don&#x27;t actually get access to any of the I/O Scheme libraries from Guix? My understanding (and it seems the understanding of several other people) is that while Guix uses the Nix daemon and thus derivations (and thus build processes) are pure once generated, the process for generating them from the Scheme code is not guaranteed to be so, given that the Scheme code can do practically anything.<p>Of course, you might not actually write non-deterministic Scheme code, but it&#x27;s nice to have the guarantee that given a .nix file and a specific version of nixpkgs, the build will always come out to the same result no matter what the creator of that file has done.",1409069254

8227891,comment,8225881,8225881,1,0,damienkatz,,,"Former serious Erlanger here. Lots of comments about performance and scaling in this thread. If you are writing a system for internal use, it&#x27;s simple scalability and robustness make Erlang an excellent choice. Engineers are expensive, machines are cheap.<p>However, if you are writing something that needs <i>massive</i> scalability, the number of machines necessary and the management of it all starts to eclipse engineering cost. Then you need to drop down to a lower level language, or at least something more runtime optimized (like java) for the heavy lifting. Then the costs and frustration of debugging across two languages becomes burdensome.<p>If you are building a competitive commercial product that will be deployed to many customers, the economics start to swing away from Erlang. Customers don&#x27;t care you needed 1/3 the engineers and testing (or whatever) to get it working. They don&#x27;t care about how much time and money you saved writing it. They care their EC2 bill is low, or the number of machines in their data center is reduced. A competitor who writes in C might have longer time to market, but they will clobber you when customers see they need 1/4 the machines to support the same workload.<p>Erlang will NEVER be fast. The reason has little to do with the language semantics, and everything to do with it&#x27;s lack of widespread adoption and therefore lack investment in compilers, runtimes and debugging tools, etc. It&#x27;s slow because the syntax is ugly and thwarts adoption. If you are a badass VM/complier/JIT/etc  engineer, you&#x27;ll apply your skills to something like Javascript, Java, Python, Ruby, etc and affect a much larger audience.<p>Also the lack of adoption makes Erlang a hard sell in a corporate environments. Sure you might get something up and running much faster, but if your erlangers leave, finding replacements engineers to maintain the system will be tough. I&#x27;ve lived this.<p>I wish I were wrong about it, but 9 years of watching Erlang on the verge of mainstream has jaded me.",1409069215

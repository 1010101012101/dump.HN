When you play, you get your reward kick, which is the basis of all addiction. Every small achievement makes you more and more stuck to it. So achievements are small but constant.<p>3. Other people grow rich when you grow poor. I.e, people steal your stuff, and humans have an instinct against allowing people steal their stuff. So you always come back to watch it",1256118899

894305,comment,894182,894261,0,0,ramanujan,,,"> All that probability shorthand can be unambiguously translated to formal definitions quite easily. But doing so would be analogous to writing a complex program in assembly - doable (and defined pretty much by the very fact that this is doable) but not very productive (and thus not worth doing unless you are debugging or something).<p>Actually I kind of disagree here.<p>With R or Haskell you can easily work directly with probability densities learned from data. One frequently uses the exact Bayes' rule expression with P(X), P(Y), and P(X|Y) all being known functions to get P(Y|X).<p>See for example functions like ecdf, which takes in an N vector of points on a 1D line and returns an actual <i>function</i>, namely the empirical cumulative density.<p><a href=""http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/ecdf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/ec...</a><p>Can be very handy when you want empirical quantiles (e.g. ""what percentage of the time do I expect to see 12000 hits in a day, given this single column with the hits for each of the last 200 days"").",1256118165

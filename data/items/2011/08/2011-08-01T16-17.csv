2833210,comment,2832314,2832314,6,0,chokma,,,"It will be interesting to see how they get around (anti-)gambling laws, at least here in Germany. The moment you offer real money for winning in luck-based games (as opposed to skill-based ones) like Diablo3, you may run afoul of the state monopoly for lottery and related games.<p>A former employer once commissioned a flash game with a western setting which included a virtual casino with several games of chance. He had to shelve the idea of offering people to cash out and the game was delayed for a long time (if I remember correctly, it was turned into a game where you could buy stuff for your character, but there was no longer a way to transfer your winnings into real money accounts)",1312217990
2833209,comment,2832314,2832935,2,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"This is not just about easier/harder to get items but also a lot about the value of item vs. the value of player skill. As soon as you no longer get better by playing more skilled but only by playing longer you will get such gold mining markets as many people value their time and don't want to spend it completely meaningless. Set a sane upper limit how long it takes to reach items and from there on only skill decides and you can basically remove the incentive to buy items for money.<p>The extreme rarity of items was once a nice idea as it allowed to add meaningful trade to the game . But every modern mmorpg has a central market so basically real player-to-player trade got taken out of the game already anyway. All that's left of it now are completely meaningless inflated prices and the real currency is no longer items but player time. Which I find sad as wasting as much player time as possible is a really poor design target.<p>I don't say it won't work out for them, but personally I hope they fail with it. Because if it succeeds, then it's obvious that they will next try to figure out how to further improve that income. I would prefer game designers to spend their time thinking about how to improve the game-play instead.",1312217989

2833205,comment,2832314,2833105,1,0,seanalltogether,,,"Here is what I wish Blizzard would do with WoW. Instead of paying $15 a month for game playing time, they should sell you game items that represent a week of play time, so let's say $15 buys you a stack of 4 in game chips. The player can then activate those chips to extend their play time or they can trade them with other players or sell them on the auction house for in game gold. On the other end, blizzard can enable a program to buy back chips at say 70% of the original value. This gives people a legitimate avenue to ""buy"" items if they want, while also controlling the gold/item farming community.",1312217963

Comparatively, I would say yes. Granted, most of the time it won't matter because you are waiting on IO (disk/network), but if you are doing cpu intensive work, it is slow and you probably need to drop down to C or offload that work to another service.<p><pre><code>    > How is Erlang more scalable than Java?

</code></pre>
My guess would be in single server scalability. Erlang's write-once variables and actor model, combined with a good VM (""green processes"") make it very single-server-scalable (verticle). It also has good built in node-to-node communication mechanisms (horizontal). Performance is probably slower than Java though. And I imagine the developer pool is much more limited than that of Java.<p><pre><code>    > What about Haskell/Ada, how are they safer than Java?

I meant safer in the type-safety sense, yes. There are also classes of static analysis tools for both. Granted, my knowledge of these languages is quite limited.<p>I certainly see your points (especially about liking the code hygiene of python), and agree that Java is not going anywhere soon. I guess I don't understand why a startup, or individual developer, would choose Java over other languages, even other languages on the JVM, for new projects.<p>Thanks for the good discussion. :)",1312217583

Currently in 2011, Python has been shedding popularity at a fast clip, but it has done so before so it is not reliable to use it in support of the argument that Python is loosing popularity as the overall trend has been upward. The thing I would caution is that the original post was asking why so many job seekers with python where looking and my summation was that due to language popularity NEW development house may not be adoption Python. In reference to you seeing Python in your environment I would assume it is because you already have Python in your environment so language selection has been made and many times there is inertia within the environment that makes language replacement a bad value proposition. I fear I poorly worded my original post when I was basically trying to say that languages go through a life-cycle of popularity and you may be seeing the result of NEW development houses opting for what is popularity because they don't have language based technical debt to consider. As well over the lifetime of a language it will shed adopters for other more popular languages. My summation was in no way intended as a critique of Python it would have been they same answer had it been Java or Perl. I was just trying to explain the life-cycle of language popularity.

In vanilla, there were a lot of gold sinks, like skill/spell training costs, riding skills, etc.  Those are sill present, but don't impact the game nearly as much.  They're mostly vanity things like gigantic bags and non-combat pets.  In-game currency was relatively rare, with most endgame bosses giving less than 1 gold per person.<p>That changed during the middle of the Burning Crusade expansion, where Blizzard basically decided that the gold sellers won, and that they were just going to flood the market with currency.  They added daily quests, which were quests that gave reputation and gold every day to top-level characters, as well as more sinks, like a character title that cost 1000 gold.<p>At this point, gold is basically a joke, because it's extremely easy to get with a minimal time investment.  Half an hour of play can get the player anywhere between 100 and 400 gold.  It appears that most of the gold sellers have moved to selling epic tradable gear and items over gold at this point.",1312216669

<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2817716"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2817716</a>
In reality, that formula is neither obscure nor contrived. I actually learnt it in high school ie. it was formally taught and we worked through how to come up with such functions given a set of inputs and outputs ie. essentially a bounded set mapping problem { 1->31, 3->31, 4->30,5->31, 6->30,7->31....}<p>So anyways, Knuth gave an interview maybe 10 years back where he lamented the lack of dexterity in math in American undergrads. He said even Stanford has to offer ""remedial courses in math"" for CS undergrads, because there is an ""interest vs ability"" mismatch. At that time ( during the 1999-2000 tech boom ), a lot of Stanford undergrads were indicating CS as their major. So they clearly had the ""interest"". But upon testing them, it was clear they didn't have the ""ability"". Hence this interest vs ability mismatch, and a need for remedial math courses at Stanford. At the time, I was studying CS with a bunch of Russian, European, Indian & American classmates. I found that Russians & Eastern Europeans tend to favor clever 1-line math code. They themselves were trained in physics and math & looked at CS problems as essentially a laborious function-mapping exercise. Whereas the Americans invariably wanted ""readable code"" and ended up writing verbose switch-cases and if-elif-endif clauses ie. essentially unrolling for-loops. 
Knuth's Concrete Math ( <a href=""http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/gkp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/gkp.html</a> ) was a sort of bible in my days. You had to know generating functions and recurrences and even stuff like complex powers. Like for instance i^i ( i raised to i ) leads to an infinite set of points with real and imaginary parts, scattered all over the 2D plane. You had to know cosets and Lagrange's theorem and set partitioning using cosets. Nowadays people simply enumerate everything as there is no penalty ( in performance terms ), so CS problems have a ""select 1 answer from set of possible answers"" flavor, rather than ""contrive a function to compute the answer"" flavor.",1312216018

A Startup is about creating something new, which takes years to develop, can scale hugely, but may never turn profitable.<p>A Muse is a form of passive income, and although it's still hard work, it can be built much quicker. The reason for that is that a Muse does not create something fundamentally new, it's usually a very conventional product in a well known market.<p>I read the Four Hour Work Week years ago and love the idea of creating passive income to work on other things.

That said, I have felt that some stores provide consistently better experiences than others. (e.g. IMHO the Apple Store in Palo Alto is usually decent. The one at the mall near Stanford (Stanford mall?) sucks.)<p>Apple's purchase experience is an incredibly personal one. I grab a blue-shirted employee and tell him/her what I want. They either bring it. Alternatively, they hand you off to someone. The fact that they can charge you using a handheld (without a checkout line or counter) startled me the first time I experienced it. I was also surprised that they could email receipts. This contrasts with my experience in Duane Reade or Sears where buying gum forces you to deal with 3 feet of paper. These are the positives.<p>Sometimes their experience sucks. It is still better than other places.
1) Employees are chatty even when there are other people waiting.

One of the first things you learn in a public key cryptography is that you have to add random bits in the computation of the ciphertext, either via simple random padding (in the case of RSA) or via some more involved steps (in the case of cyclic group-based cryptography). I don't know much about homomorphic encryption (the concept has always seemed contrived to me - if you don't trust your cloud provider, hosting your own servers will always be much more efficient), but I assume they use similar tricks.<p>As for the thing about polynomials: it should be obvious that any polynomial-time computation on an input of a fixed size can be expressed by a DAG of logic gates. Logic gates can in turn be represented by simple polynomials over the field F_2 = { 0, 1 }, and the composition of gates is then simply the composition of polynomials.<p>Since we're talking about fixed-size inputs, this does not really capture the full Turing machine model. However, since all practical encryption schemes can be broken via brute force in exponential time anyway, it only really makes sense to worry about implementing polynomial-time computations in the context of homomorphic encryption.",1312215585

Maybe less skilled work, almost certainly worse paying work, but okay, they probably won't starve to death. And the benefits of industrialization make the economy as a whole grow, so their kids are actually better off. Great!<p>The problem is when we carry it out. As my ancestors discussed, we're going to reach a point where there just aren't more jobs. Or rather, a point where the value of the work done by robots essentially for free is so great that it completely dwarfs the value of whatever minor service labor is still done by humans, making human labor essentially valueless.<p>And thus the logical end result of mechanization, and one I'd argue we're starting to see already, is a world in which a) nearly everything, including food, is produced ""for free"" by largely self-sustaining robots, and b) nearly everyone on Earth has starved to death.

A straight pay-for-usage plan is unlikely to work.<p>> I'm not sure why you see it as a good thing that average users subsidize top users. Surely top users should pay in proportion to their additional use?<p>What exactly do you think the monthly fee is?  Do you really think it costs AT&T $15 (your suggested fee) to provide someone with the ability to connect to their network?  This is still low-usage customers subsidizing the high-usage customers.<p>> Structure usage so that the average cost per month stays the same (and thus total revenue stays the same) but heavy users get charged more.<p>That doesn't work, for the reasons I pointed out.  Some heavy users will pay a <i>little</i> more, but some will not.  They'll simply cut back or leave.  Very few would be willing to pay the massive fees that they would incur.  So the net result is a massive drop in revenue.  You can't just reprice everything and expect usage patterns to remain the same.<p>> It's more fair and is the model used in virtually every other service and industry in existence.<p>Yet everyone seems to argue against this model when we're talking about Comcast.",1312214978

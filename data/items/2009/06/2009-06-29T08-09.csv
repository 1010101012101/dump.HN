678698,comment,678330,678650,0,0,wheels,,,"I suspect it's not about the government or the press -- it's about the specifics.  If NYT had written the Wikipedia folks and said, ""Don't add this information, it compromises our security."" they'd have been laughed at.  If they say, ""There's this specific guy, and this specific information, and we think there's a good chance if you say this it'll do this bad thing to him."" it's another story.  I think the government would probably be able to make a similar appeal.  ""Bob might get killed."" is a lot more actionable than ""National security might be compromised.""",1246265822

Remember the specially coded DVD players that were created for the Oscars screeners? Well that is the sort of territory you are heading into.<p>The big problem is that to copy the data you have to read it, and to read the data you have to read it! There is no way for the USB stick to tell if the process that is reading the data is showing it to the user or writing it to the hard disk. Ignore the USB stick, it is not the issue, the issue is the data. You encrypt your data and you need to write an application to display the data to the user, anything else that reads the file will just see gibberish. Your application, which knows how to decode the data, will be the only way to view the data.<p>Of course this can be hacked, what can be made by man can be broken by man, but you have just upped the entrance fee. Then comes the trade off, is your data valuable enough to cover the expense and inconvenience to the user of the custom software and is it too expensive for the thief to hack the application?<p>Of course the application could be copied so you now need to lock the application to the hardware so that the data becomes useless without it. As a USB stick is just a computer on a chip you could build some custom hardware that is required by the application (such as the decryption built into silicon) so that the application cannot be run without the USB stick.<p>And that is the best you are going to get.<p>Did I mention that this could get expensive :)",1246265017

This doesn't matter, but it does mean your argument is incorrect.<p>I'll also point out that both phones have a number of buttons around on the side.  The iPhone has the large, long connector port on the bottom and three buttons on the side.  That is more than the ""one button"" that you mention.",1246263517

I hate snark even when it's justified, though you very often post snark in places where snark is useful and accurate. Every time you get into one of these arguments, however, it's a nuisance. You had a valid starting point re: Jailbreaking, but when ubernostrum gave a valid response, you snarked for no reason other than snarking; when I asked you to stop, you snarked at me.<p>I get your point - that you meant to say something other than what you said - but it would help your case if you ever took the time to explain yourself with a less-than-pompous attitude.

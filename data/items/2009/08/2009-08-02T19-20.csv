When I visited the site, I first searched for wordoids containing something, and then I wanted to go back to the completely random wordoids. I clicked the back button, but I found it didn't work. A clear button for the search box would also work instead, but I think people would want to go to previous searches more than they would want to clear the fragment box.<p>I also didn't read the help text below the form until I read a comment about it, so I didn't need it, but it wasn't distracting. The quality help text doesn't tell me anything more than the form tells me, but it was helpful to find out about the 10 character fragment limit and the blending languages strategy. Perhaps you could replace it with a ""tips"" section, or put it under a link that says "" > Help"" with a right arrow that drops down the help when you click on it.",1249243054
737983,comment,737460,737645,0,0,chaosprophet,,,"I wouldn't agree that the iPhone is a phone first. How many people bought an iPhone so that they could call or text others? The value proposition of the iPhone is not in its phone features, it's in the smartphone features. The only reason that it doesn't seem to matter is because there is no real rival to the iPhone platform. I do agree that the smartphone market needs more real rivals to the iPhone (I'm kinda wondering how Nokia is fumbling so badly here). If the HTC Hero is as good as it is claimed to be, then maybe the iPhone will see a hit in the hardware division, and Apple will be forced to behave more like a democracy.",1249242954

Once you have figured out how to parallelize the algorithm, then you need to worry about the architecture, but only if you need to eek out every last bit of performance. In most viable cases, you should be able to get a pretty decent speedup without tearing your hair out.<p>In any case, OpenCL is based on CUDA (the driver API), and they are practically the same (compare the reference manuals and you'll see what I mean).<p>Also, GPU computing is much, much more efficient than CPU computing (in terms of FLOPS/Watt). A high-end GPU (say, a Tesla C1060) can probably pull between 200-300 watts (~2x what a high-end Xeon uses), but can do over 1TFLOP with sufficiently optimized code.",1249242849

I guess you could argue that academia is bad because you don't get to sit around and jerk off and collect a pay check, and you'd be right, but you would completely be missing the point.<p>For me, academia is about examining the limits of our knowledge in a field and then working to expand it.<p><i>The freedom you have is only an illusion.

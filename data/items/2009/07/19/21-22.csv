The beauty of the scientific approach is that it makes as few assumptions as possible while remaining sane -- it doesn't force us into any single dogma.  Good science doesn't lead to Nazism; a racist agenda and the backing of a powerful nation does.  Sure, science has been misused (social Darwinism), but why not examine those specific misuses instead of throwing out the entire rationalist agenda?<p>For those who are interested, I recommend E. O.

I vividly recall competitors making bold, outlandish, claims like these on a monthly basis back then.  None of them ever came to pass.  They required too much infrastructure build out, too much cooperation from ISPs and website owners, and the companies behind them demanded too much involvement and too much money from all parties in the chain.  There was a CDN rush back then, too, and only a few managed to raise enough money and build out fast enough to be successful at it.  This kind of technology requires a build out similar to a CDN, but with far more involvement of parties that are very unlikely to have an interest in being involved.<p>I've had long conversations with folks at Akamai, Red Swoosh, and many others, in this particular area...and it's astonishing how much money it takes to build this stuff out, and finding profitable ways to build out small (making it useful enough to make money on <i>without</i> first spending millions and signing on dozens of ISPs) is very difficult.

Squid (and many others) have excellent cache expiry and replacement heuristics; but Squid can only cache 20-35% of the web, because it's simply not safe to cache the rest of it, either because it's session-based and could be different for every user, or because it is SSL-encrypted and can't be seen by the proxy, or because it explicitly disallows caching with Cache-Control or Expires headers, etc.  And, even if the site doesn't tell you how long you can cache something, it's reasonably safe to guess based on the age of the object (a five year old object is probably not going to change in the three days it takes to run through a full replacement in your cache; while one that is 30 minutes old could possibly change dozens of times, so Squid will send an If-Modified-Since a few minutes later, with gradually lengthening periods between checks as the age of the object increases).",1248038825

Instead, how about:<p>In hindsight, length of time is perceived as change in world view. The more your mental state has changed in a given period of time, the longer it seems. The reason the decade from 5 to 15 seem so much longer than 55 to 65 is because of the drastic changes in your world view that occur during childhood. It's the same reason not a lot of 5 year olds are friends with 15 year olds, yet I imagine most 55 year olds can be good friends with most 65 year olds.<p>This hypothesis would predict several micro and macro phenomena which are testable:<p>For the micro scale, two groups of subjects are placed into an environment with no way of tracking time (no windows, no clocks) for a month. The control group is provided with books/TV shows/news programmes of their choice, asked to pick ones that they've read/seen and enjoy. The test group is asked to pick books/programmes they think they'll enjoy, but have never read or seen. After about a week, notable events are planned - maybe the light bulb burns out, or the sheets are changed to ones which are bright red, or maybe the food in the cafeteria changes. At the end of the month, the person is asked to estimate the amount of time that passed between certain events. If the hypothesis is correct, the control group should perceive less time having passed between the events compared to the test group.<p>For the macro scale, my theory would predict people with monotonous, repetitive, jobs to experience the effects of ""time passes faster with aging"" more than those which expose them to new phenomena.

713432,comment,712934,713302,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>Is the idea that postmodern literary criticism is hard to read because we're untrained really that toxic?</i><p>I have a graduate degree in literature and, for what it's worth, can assure you that even with years of training I find a lot of that stuff unintelligible. At the time it struck me as a classic emporer's-new-clothes situation. I would occasionally amuse myself by tossing out completely bogus sentences that sounded just like, say, Derrida, and watch people nod vacuously.<p>That being said, I applaud your open-mindedness. Postmodern criticism <i>is</i> full of the most unbelievable bullshit, but in retrospect I'm no longer willing to dismiss the whole thing. This sympathy would probably instantly vaporize if I were forced to read those papers again, mind you. But I've learned about two things in the meantime that are reminiscent of postmodernism and which I do take seriously.<p>One is the recent wave of neural/psychological research about how our experience of ourselves and reality is constructed in ways that don't at all correspond to our beliefs. There are a great many such findings and from what I've gleaned, they consistently refute our concept of ourselves as rational actors making controlled decisions as we move through objective reality. (I'm still waiting for someone to write a good general survey of this material. There's a crying need for one, though it might not be very popular.)<p>The other is the history of religious and spiritual ideas, which I was astonished to find contain many of the same teachings about how our identities are constructed and conditioned. If you read any Vedantic literature, for example, the first thing you run across is ""you are not who you think you are"". Similar concepts are found in Western traditions. This skepticism about the artifacts of the conditioned mind is very postmodern in a way. But there is also a profound difference: while spiritual teachings are all about connection with something <i>beyond</i> mental constructs, the postmodernists deny any such beyond. Regardless of one's position on religion etc., I think this points to the real weakness of postmodernism: because it treats everything as the same kind of fiction to be deconstructed, it lacks any compass for distinguishing true from false or good from bad. It's inevitable that you end up with a profusion of arbitrary language, a.k.a. bullshit, when you start from the premise that everything is bullshit in the first place.",1248038302

It feels like memory ""diff"" sizes more than anything else. As you get older fewer things change versus what you've experienced before, so fewer memories take root in that duration of time versus youth. And the memory samples are the tickrate by which we sense the passing of time.<p>I think there may be a minor biological element to this, too.

713423,comment,712858,712858,0,0,Tichy,,,"For myself I agree, but I was never big into engineering approaches. Very suspicious of agile methods, too. The way I see it: for example in mathematics the first proof of a difficult theorem is often very long and complex. Over time more mathematicians might look at the proof and find ways to make it simpler. Eventually you might have a 5 line version of a proof that used to be 30 pages long.<p>I don't see how any agile method or engineering approach could help much in getting the 5 line version from the beginning. There always seems to be a kind of ""crunch"" step involved in solving the problem. Once the problem is solved, the solution can be cleaned up. But solving the problem at first you explore maybe hundreds of possible paths in your mind, and combine lots and lots of aspects. You are stuck in the jungle and try to find a path to the summit. Once you are on the summit, you can look down the mountain and see the easier routes you missed on your way up - because in the jungle you can't see very far, and you have to fight for every meter of progress.<p>I find the same applies to my own code - which is always crappy, anyway. But refactoring usually goes quite fast once the first working version has come into existence.<p>I'd expect having to focus on getting some agile method right would just distract me from solving the problem.",1248038076

From the perspective of a child(me as a child) every day is nearly always an anticipation, because nearly everyday you have school and every morning I would wake up hoping its not a working day, only to be disappointed ~70% of the time.

713402,comment,713339,713339,0,0,andreyf,,,"Yuk, why doesn't it bother anyone that this is proposing a say-so theory without any suggestions for testing it? Truth isn't truth if it isn't falsifiable. Instead, how about:<p>In hindsight, length of time is perceived as change in world view. The more your mental state has changed in a given period of time, the longer it seems. The reason the decade from 5 to 15 seem so much longer than 55 to 65 is because of the drastic changes in your world view that occur during childhood. It's the same reason not a lot of 5 year olds are friends with 15 year olds, yet I imagine most 55 year olds can be good friends with most 65 year olds.<p>This hypothesis would predict several micro and macro phenomena which are testable:<p>For the micro scale, two groups of subjects are placed into an environment with no way of tracking time (no windows, no clocks) for a month. The control group is provided with books/TV shows/news programmes of their choice, asked to <i>pick ones that they've read/seen</i> and enjoy. The test group is asked to pick books/programmes they think they'll enjoy, but have never read or seen. After about a week, notable events are planned - maybe the light bulb burns out, or the sheets are changed to ones which are bright red, or maybe the food in the cafeteria changes. At the end of the month, the person is asked to estimate the amount of time that passed between certain events. If the hypothesis is correct, the control group should perceive less time having passed between the events compared to the test group.<p>For the macro scale, my theory would predict people with monotonous, repetitive, jobs to experience the effects of ""time passes faster with aging"" more than those which expose them to new phenomena. So a Java-only career engineer will experience the effect more than someone who spends time learning new languages.",1248037377

My average Google search isn't ""blog"", ""quantum mechanics"" or ""ubuntu"". If I was looking for information on those topics, I would first check Wikipedia and follow the external links from there. My regular Google search is something along the lines of ""sony ericsson f305 maximum application size"", ""parkour new delhi"" or ""nsstring url encoding"" (this is from my search history).<p>Google gave me satisfactory results for all 3 of those queries. Let's do a comparison.<p>(Note: DDG is DuckDuckGo)<p>==========<p>Term: ""sony ericsson f305 maximum application size""<p>* Topsy: No results.<p>* DDG: The 5th result gave me my answer.<p>* Google: The second result gave me my answer.<p>* Cuil: 1 result, no answer.<p>==========<p>Term: ""parkour new delhi""<p>* Topsy: No results.<p>* DDG: Many results with links to parkour groups across New Delhi. The second result (Parkour India) was the best result.<p>* Google: Many results with links to parkour groups across New Delhi, but I found several irrelevant results mixed with the ones I was looking for. Again, Parkour India got 2nd place.<p>* Cuil: Most of the results were random blogs about parkour, most of them not Indian. The Parkour India group on Ning got the second place.<p>==========<p>Term: ""nsstring url encoding""<p>* Topsy: No results.<p>* DDG: The top result was from Apple's documentation, followed by a few mailing list discussions on the topic and two blog posts. Except the last 2 results, all of the results were right on target.<p>* Google: Got some of the same results, but shuffled around and mixed with <i>many</i> irrelevant results. Moreover, Apple's documentation was at the bottom of the page.<p>* Cuil: Several mailing list results, very few were relevant. I found my answer, though.<p>==========<p>So, Topsy is useful only if you want to know what's hot right now, Google and DuckDuckGo return nearly the same results, but with DuckDuckGo having relevant results closer to the top of the page and Cuil is pretty much useless.<p>(I always mess up formatting.

The facebook engineering notes was a little more helpful, with at least average latency 173ms at 200k qps with an intel 8-core box with 1GE NIC (they could push it to 300k but the latency was too high.) So a max 500k qps (with unknown latency) on a much more expensive T2 with 10GE NIC is not that impressive.<p>I'd like to see median and 99 percentile latency for any throughput numbers.",1243405945

628096,comment,628034,628034,0,0,jbyers,,,"This article advises the use of RAID in all servers:<p>""But on the server, RAID is a definite must.""<p>I submit it as a warning to startups who value their time and money: treat unqualified technology advice with skepticism.<p>RAID has costs in time and complexity.  In some cases, you will spend that money because the alternatives cost more.  A write-heavy MySQL server is constrained by IOPS.  Ignoring SSD for a moment, the two ways to get more IOPS are faster spindles and more spindles.  This is why RAID 10 on 15K SAS disks wind up in database servers.  Once you have exhausted other solutions and are truly IOPS-bound, the cost of adding expensive disks to your database server is likely much less than the alternatives.<p>Let's take a case where RAID does not make sense.  On our site, our webservers are predominantly CPU bound.  Aside from reading code and writing temporary files, the only disk access on these servers is HTTP logs.  Every night, we sync the logs, process them, and store the on S3.  RAID would at best save one day's worth of logs in case of catastrophic disk failure.  If we could not tolerate the loss of even a few minutes of logs, there are a variety of software solutions that would accomplish this goal without spending money on RAID controllers and disks.  Our MogileFS storage nodes also do not benefit from RAID, where we save many thousands of dollars a month by pushing availability up the stack into inexpensive software.

628095,comment,627987,627987,0,0,jules,,,"> Its interesting to notice that a larger number of hat colors poses no problem here.  For any set of hat colors , the prisoners can pick an abelian group structure on .  Then, the first prisoner guesses the ’sum’ of all the hat colors he can see.  The next guy can then subtract the sum of the hat colors he sees from the hat color the first guy said to find his own hat color.  Again, this argument repeats, and so everyone except the first guy gets out.  For the case of black and white, the previous argument used black = 0 (mod 2) and white = 1 (mod 2).<p>So the first guy says the sum, not a color? If he's allowed to say arbitrary things he can as well tell everyone their color ""next guy is white, next green, etc."".",1243405199

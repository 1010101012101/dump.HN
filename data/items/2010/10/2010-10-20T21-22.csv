Jaeggi et al also have a 2010 paper extending/replicating the results.<p>More interesting to me is that after reading a popular article about an increase in lucid dreaming since the 1980s I thought there would be a connection to gaming. Turns out there are a few academic papers exploring this. This is important to the type of culture technology engenders and the type of internal actors or agents we are at the core, passive or active. I think computer games rather than TV or flim, the active hyperlink rather than the ""take our word for it"" print hold promise in the sense of making us better at being individuals. Attention-seeking bleating about the lowering of attention spans in recent decades doesn't take into account that there is something to be said for brevity; and that there are far too many system-building waffling patriarchal walruses ""performing"" their alpha-male genius through turgid prose (especially in philosophy and related disciplines).",1287611863

1813276,comment,1810450,1811424,0,0,thesz,,,"Cell BE was made without compiler support. You weren't able to feed your C/C++/Fortran program to the compiler and obtain more or less parallel version of your program. This complicates things, you had to manually parallelize your program.<p>The tool support for Cell BE SPU was close to existent (no, I didn't mess words up). It was of such low quality so that you pretty had to use Emacs with assembler highlighting mode to to any serious work for SPU. The difference in speed between gcc and hand made assembler code circa 2007 was about 1.5-2 times.<p>Both PPU and SPU are in-order, so you have to avoid minefield of random memory accesses. You had to manually write allocators and such while holding up SPU constraints.<p>In-order architectures does not facilitate abstractions. You cannot simply recompile code from out-of-order x86 for in-order Cell BE and obtain reasonable performance (say, about 80% from maximum). You will have to optimize agressively.<p>You cannot load too much into 256Kbytes combined data and program memory of SPU. Divide those 256Kbytes by two, and you have about 128Kbytes of program memory (you should divide it again - one for working program and another for loaded program) and 128Kbytes, or 8Kquadwords (16 bytes per quad word) of data memory. Data memory you should divide again - one part of your data is constant, perhaps, or you work with one patr and another is being loaded. 4K quadwords. Two operations per cycle on quadwords, 2K cycles to process the whole data block. The latency of Cell memory subsystem is very high, so our 2Kcycles should be comparable to time needed to load that amount of data into SPU. So you have to be very, very careful to keep SPU loaded and working.<p>Many new chips suffer from lack of compiler support, especially in automatic parallelization. Cell BE surely did. So does GreenArray. Cell BE suffered from lack of memory on SPU, main parallel engine block. GreenArray does that as well. Cell BE used simple to implement but hard to program in-order architecture in all its' processing parts. GreenArray uses stack architecture which is extremely hard to program.<p>So, in my eyes, GreenArray is Cell BE ported to Forth. ;)",1287611740

Math doesn't help my programming anyways.<p>Instead I think people think like:

I'm going to look at other fields to improve my programming.<p>I think the problem is, and the author hints at it, is that people tend to over glorify the importance of math at the expense of drowning out other fields, like prose.<p>In some fields like web programming, I would say that yes, my time is better spent learning how to write understandable code instead of how to solve complex equations.

Having a single, official, centralized place where users (and not only some of them, basically <i>all</i> OS X users) can find, rate and buy your product is a blessing for developers, especially smaller shops. I expect we'll see some of the ""success stories"" that happened on the iP* platform through the AppStore, because it gives considerable exposure to people that would otherwise probably struggle to get it. That part is probably worth the 30% cut — not so much for big brands like Adobe though.
If it also provides updates for all software, as the App Store does, it's an awesome feature. I'd say it's basically the equivalent of a Linux repo, with built-in sales.<p>> Launchpad<p>I'm not sure about that one either. We'll see.<p>> Full Screen Apps<p>I'd tend to agree.

This was the basis of Long Term Capital Management and this was the basis of the ""synthetic"" Triple A bonds built out of sub-prime mortgages.<p>The ""free money"" comes of out the risk combining/hedging approach through the implication that by adding up supposedly uncorrelated risks, you can create a lower-risk financial ""vehicle"" that still delivers a rate of return somewhat comparable to underlying items. If a bank pays 1% interest and you can get a 5% ""virtually risk free return"", then you've got 4% profit. Now Black and Merton of LTCM went one step further. They were so mathematically impressive that they got a virtually infinite line of credit to borrow against to use in the risk-combining approach. The implication was they would be, again, getting a nearly-risk-free rate of return and so investment banks could lend to them nearly-risk-free too. Even their massive failure didn't convince people. The entire stable of CDO etc product sold on the same basis, the basis of providing risks no greater than the highest rated corporate bond but with significantly higher return. We can see how ""risk-free"" they really were.<p>Moreover, it is true that if you can find a bunch of small, uncorrelated risks <i>with finite mean and variance</i>, you can add them up to get a big, tractable Gaussian distribution with a very small variance (that's the mean-value theorem, in fact). So the synthetic bond approach rests firmed on the standard modeling of the market as akin to Brownian motion.<p>The problem with this approach is that, as Mandlebrot pointed out is that one doesn't actually wind-up dealing with distributions having finite variance. Adding up distributions without finite variance gets you a distribution in the L-stable family of distributions, which are in general much less tractable, not having finite variance themselves. In this light, it seems clearer why synthetic bonds turned not to be the free money they claimed to be.<p>One might argue that this mean that the ""efficient market hypothesis"" itself would imply that markets <i>don't</i> follow a Gaussian distribution. I'll leave that those who still some faith this formulation - I'd personally claim this ""hypothesis"" isn't even a coherently position.",1287608541

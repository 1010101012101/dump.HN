We focus on playable exhibits, and educating the public as to how games are made. One of the ways we do this is by offering free kids programming classes in Scratch on the weekends, and by hosting kids camps this summer.<p>But we have a major problem: we have only a handful of terrible, broken PCs from people's garages and such. What we really need is someone to donate an old computer lab, or to donate a smattering of new netbooks.<p>We need about 10 PCs, the more similar they are to each other, the better. Newer is better, as we'd like to teach Unity and modern programming languages as well. We'll install Ubuntu ourselves, but we need Windows due to the number of game development systems that are point-and-click available in that OS.<p>Anyone who thinks they could help should email me at alex@themade.org and check us out at http://www.themade.org<p>We can offer a tax write-off for the donation, and maybe even host a party for your company.",1343073545

There's a lot of information out there that doesn't have relevancy to a user. When it does, that information transitions from simply being ""information"" into ""news.""<p>In terms of story, we are as a culture oriented toward story and narrative. I think that's been true for forever. Cave paintings are remnants of ancient narratives (and of the point that information (there are buffaloes) becomes news (there are buffaloes near us, so we killed them) in the same way that newspapers reflect the remnants of more recent narratives and how all sorts of information delivery vehicles now contain narratives today.<p>The key thing about The News today though is that it's still pretty reflective of old forms, and that's probably where your frustration with the story format comes in. Those old forms actually made sense when they were created, in part because they reflected the needs of the delivery systems.<p>Of course now the needs of, say, telegraphs during the civil war (which is where the ""reverse pyramid"" system was created) is a silly way to make your news.<p>Which is why what some newsrooms and devs are doing to blow up the story, to start thinking about how to put information across in ways that are exciting and new and reflective both of medium but also representational (and respectful) of the information itself is pretty damn kick-ass.<p>I'm thinking of something like this:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/06/11/sports/basketball/nba-shot-analysis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/06/11/sports/basketb...</a><p>There's actually a lot of narrative there, but it's narrative in a very different way than we'd normally think about it.

Everything is RS232 and RS485, pretty straightforward.<p>In terms of reversing the actual lock protocol, that was a bit more tricky.  First step was tapping the line between the portable programmer and lock with an o-scope (a 70s-era HP scope; only thing I could afford at the time, haha) to figure out the voltage levels involved and the basic properties of the communication.  From there, I hit it with the Saleae Logic to see what the communication actually looked like.<p>From there, I wrote some Python scripts to walk over the data from the logic analyzer and attempt to decode the data.

There are many people at Google and other places that are not satisfied with their options. To these people, money is not as satisfying as control and advancement. If Mayer is able to offer key people better options, many will be inclined to at least explore the idea.<p>Don't hang on to this idea that Yahoo is the place to suicide your career and/or company via acquisition. That's the old and current Yahoo. If Mayer is able to overcome that old inertia, then Yahoo could easily become a very hot place to be again. A good analogy is to think of an old, massive forest. It's all old trees that are half dead and centuries of undergrowth. A fire finally comes along and sweeps through. All of the undergrowth and dead trees are burned away. Now many young and vibrant plants can grow again, animals come back in abundance, and the whole forest ecosystem is better than ever. And please, hold off on the fucking criticisms of my version of forest ecology.

The Gaussian process is a distribution over functions, the properties of which are governed by the covariance function - so the prior over the function, or the assumption about its complexity and form, is determined by the choice of covariance function. Of course it is very important to choose a prior that corresponds to the functional form you are interested in, which is actually discussed and empirically validated in the literature referred to in that post.

Prior to SF.com, everything lived in Excel spreadsheets on network shares. After some research we went all-in on a SF.com implementation. 65 'sales' staff used it (all with 'unlimited' licenses), with between 200-300 users on an in house application at any given time pushing data into SF via the API. Overall, I was quite happy with SF.com.<p>The dashboards and reports are generally quite powerful, and AppExchange is great for hooking into 3rd party apps. If an app isn't available on AppExchange, you can always write custom code and deploy it to SF.com - which we did quite a bit of. SF also has campaign functionality built in - so if you have 250 hot leads you want to work through, you can dump them into a new campaign and just assign calls from that.<p>I recommend getting a SF.com developer account (they're free and you don't need to talk to a salesperson) and trying out some of the functionality.

But most of my code is D3, so it&#x27;s a lot of javascript anyway. And by doing angular, I basically upload one page to the user, and then from there out, they never touch my server. (Data is served by Cloudant - a YC comp). So even though I&#x27;ve had > 10k page views, my server is hardly touched. And everyone gets really responsive interaction since it is all done in the browser, occasionally waiting for new data to serve. So, while this was painful to build, I can really see the allure of client-side single-page apps.",1388797173

I&#x27;m sorry but I still can&#x27;t find in your original post where you addressed the &quot;If enough people were to work together to make that change a reality, is there anything that could realistically stop that change from happening?&quot; question.\nWhich is probably my fault for not explaining what I meant correctly. Maybe a better way to put it would have been, &quot;how specifically would an ideal government work in your mind... and why is that impossible?&quot;<p>From what you&#x27;ve written I believe (and please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) you&#x27;re saying that your ideal form of government is one run by individuals without corruption who can remain entirely impartial. But those people don&#x27;t exist, therefore it&#x27;s just not possible.<p>I would probably be inclined to agree that nobody is above all corruption etc. (especially not the tens of thousands it would take to fill every public position in the country) so in that regard I would probably agree with you.<p>My point, and I hope you can agree is that, sure we aren&#x27;t going to find perfect people to run the country, because more likely than not, nobody including ourselves is completely perfect. But we can look at the types of corruption and other problems in government like campaign finance laws and find solutions. And here&#x27;s the most important part, because we live in a democracy, nothing can stop us. For example we as a country might say, &quot;okay, so all of this corruption you politicians are so fond of but isn&#x27;t technically illegal, it&#x27;s all illegal now. And if you participate in it you&#x27;ll lose your seat and go to prison.&quot; Which for some types of corruption and campaign finance laws that already exist happens pretty frequently [1] [2]<p>Then we might say, &quot;campaigns are all publicly funded from now on.&quot;<p>But no matter what we say or do, or how many tries it takes, because all of our votes count, and we can all go vote, we can keep on trying to make our Union a better one.<p>[1] - Daily show clip about former Illinois governor Rob Blagojevich being convicted of corruption charges.  <a href""http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-june-28-2011/conhair---rod-blagojevich-is-convicte"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-june-28-2011/conhair--...</a><p>[2] Rep.

At one point the synthetic cop asks his human partner &quot;we don&#x27;t need a warrant for this?&quot; And the partner is like &quot;I didn&#x27;t think so either.&quot; The point of the joke is that the robot wants to follow the warrant requirement, because its a rule, but the human cop knows that its okay to break the rules when the bad guy could get away.<p>So no, not everyone opposes mass surveillance.

These two things are clearly not the same. Porn (even in a small dose) for young children is almost universally accepted to cause long term psychological damage. Cola in a small dose is universally accepted to cause zero long tern harm. I think that if you gave your kid enough Cola to where it was universally accepted to cause major long term harm to them - CPS would come take that kid from you and you would likely be arrested for child endangerment (thus it is against the law).<p>Secondly the govt is not forcibly preventing you from uncensored internet. It is the ISPs, and not forcibly, all you have to do is acknowledge that you want it (this could hardly be considered forcible)<p>If a 4 year old kid drinks a bottle of soda, how will that affect them for the rest of their life? If a 4 year old kid watches a (simulated) hardcore porn rape scene, is that more likely to affect them negatively for the rest of his or her life?<p>How does that kid get at the soda? usually their parents or caretaker gives it to them right? Is that how they usually run across porn randomly on the web too? Maybe parents should watch kids every second they are online, but that is hardly possible with the ubiquity of internet devices today. At least if a kid sneaks a Cola at 2am whilst his parents are asleep - it is clearly missing the next day. Not so obvious if they were sneaking out and surfing the web incognito.",1388795968

Obviously we have elections, but his (and my) point was that the elections don&#x27;t really change much because the real power usually ends up being those with the deepest pockets or those in charge of government organisations - neither of which the everyday man can elect nor control.<p>I do think you&#x27;re right that it is theoretically possible for a truly impartial and incorruptible individual to make change; but I think that&#x27;s hugely unlikely because I can&#x27;t see them ever getting enough sponsorship to pay for their election campaign, nor for them to play dirty enough to win enough voters (since politicians and businesses will spin all sorts of negative PR about unfavourable candidates).<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I don&#x27;t think &quot;true democracy&quot; would ever work because at some point we have to acknowledge that nobody is educated enough on every subject to make an informed opinion about it.

(Incidentally, I appear to be entering a &quot;play&quot; phase right now.)<p>I can&#x27;t explain it exactly, but the 2/3 thing makes me really uneasy about learning the language.<p>On one side, there is Python 2 which is supposed to die in the non-immediate future.

It&#x27;s the heir apparent. It&#x27;s going to be &quot;the&quot; Python in the nearer-than-you-think future.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t seem ready. You get the impression that you&#x27;ll start a greenfield project and then get to a point where you want to drop in a well-known component and you just won&#x27;t be able to.<p>You also look at the fact that it&#x27;s been around for over half a decade yet 80% of of respondents to this survey say they use 2 more than 3, 40% have never touched it, and 20% say the whole thing was a bad idea. If you were walking into that environment, would you really be so quick to disregard it?<p>I suppose the answer is to just learn it all and try to keep   the differences in mind as you go, but it&#x27;s understandable the a lot of people don&#x27;t want to half to learn and semi-unlearn the same language all at once.",1388794053

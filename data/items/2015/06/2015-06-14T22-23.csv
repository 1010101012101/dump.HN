There is no locked in contract.<p>2. Free wifi everywhere and all businesses have free wifi (coffee shop, pho, book store,...)<p>3. Huge number of iPhone are used devices. They can get it for cheap because they are either stolen (in US) and hand carry to Vietnam.<p>4. Most people have family in US that would buy the phone for them or bring used ones back.<p>5. iPhone have very high resale value. So they use it for awhile and resell to get new ones. It&#x27;s not that much of a big cost.<p>6. Smart phone in Vietnam is like car in US.

9716619,comment,9716281,9716281,0,0,tzs,,,"The most historically accurate way to describe things is to use &quot;GNU&quot; as a specification. Any system that meets the FSF&#x27;s definition of a GNU system could then reasonably be described as a GNU system.<p>A GNU system built using a Linux kernel would then reasonably be called a GNU/Linux system, but that would not be the <i>name</i> the system. It would be a statement that it is a Linux system that meets the GNU specification.<p>The naming rights to a system historically go to whoever puts it together. So the complete system that Red Hat sells is the Red Hat Enterprise Linux system. That&#x27;s its name, because Red Hat put it together so they get naming rights.<p>The complete system my past employer, Interactive Systems Corporation, sold that consisted of System V ported by us from the 3B2 sources to the 80386 was a UNIX system, but its name was 386/ix. We are the ones who put it together, so we got to pick the name, even though very significant components came from outside.<p>When describing the system named Red Hat Enterprise Linux by capabilities rather than be name, then it can be called a GNU/Linux system because it satisfies the functional requirements to be a GNU system.<p>For giving credit to those who provided the components you used to build your system, the traditional place to do this would be in the documentation and if you have a GUI in the &quot;about&quot; box of some major GUI component, such as whatever corresponds to Apple&#x27;s Finder or Window&#x27;s Explorer on your system.",1434322546

For example, casting `char`s to `int`s is a compiler error or casting pointers of one type to another? Would this kind of compiler be as useful as I think it would for a certain class of errors?",1434319358

The high-level continuation-based ones are ridiculously unsuitable for actual web programming (they store full state on the server at all times, and the URL gives you full access to the session, among other issues), but the lower-level ones actually look pretty clean and modern. And yet all the documentation keeps talking about the continuation stuff, bizarrely.",1434319351

I normally think of arc-welding-deposited steel as &quot;comparable to an arc furnace&quot;, i.e. very high quality.  Could be that they&#x27;re not using enough gas or something, and so end up with oxidation at the surface and possibly within the material; I&#x27;d like to see more detail to be sure.",1434319272

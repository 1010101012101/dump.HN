I also understand reasons for Snowden to travel to/through those states (he does not want to go to prison and no one else is willing to have him).<p>However, I&#x27;ll say this unequivocally: from a world-wide perspective, United States is far ahead of rest of the world (including many other liberal democracies)  in terms of value put on civil liberties. Most countries are far more communitarian -- there are simply far more exceptions to free speech, privacy, etc... rights and (unlike in the US) many of those exceptions aren&#x27;t even rooted in protection from a &quot;clear and present danger.&quot;<p>(Related: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_you_are_lynching_Negroes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_you_are_lynching_Negroes</a> )",1372283964

5949389,comment,5948194,5948194,12,0,mncolinlee,,,"I think it&#x27;s clear why. It used to be that most jobs could be performed without any particular major. Instead, a college degree was taken as a generic business indicator that you know how to work. People with degrees in hard sciences could always take entry-level computer jobs with no special training. Technical specialization has resulted in a situation where businesses cannot find enough high technology workers and the students exiting colleges have less useful liberal arts degrees in this economy like journalism. In the past, this was solved by on-the-job training.<p>Today, large businesses often solve this worker shortage by outsourcing the job to substandard contractors in countries with far lower pay bands. Businesses would rather pay to train a cheap, blank slate worker than pay the premium to train an American with a four-year college degree. This can be profoundly short-sighted, but the most recent management school generation is too often wedded to bean counting and manipulating vanity metrics. They often fail to grasp subjective and hidden business costs. HP&#x27;s Carly Fiorina is a classic example. She wanted to cut R&D to zero because she believed it was purely a cost center and produced no profit. If anything cannot be counted, it does not count.",1372283694

Google has clearly put together a good system too recently with their generated playlists, and last.fm has had similar recommendations. However, as far as a recommendation system that exposes you to new, different music you would have never selected on your own, Pandora makes good choices with surprising accuracy.<p>Part of that is their Music Genome Project where human beings listened to every song Pandora hosted and rated every aspect of it. I&#x27;m sure now they just have a ton of other useful data from listening habits. Regardless, I think the music could almost be seen as secondary.<p>If all Pandora wanted to do was have me pay $36 dollars for a weekly, automated newsletter telling me of new songs I might like and then collecting my feedback for future newsletters made for me, I&#x27;d likely pay for that. They could even alert me to new concerts in my area. Of course, the music streaming ties that all together in a really compelling way.<p>So, I think if anything you could say that about 50% to musicians and 50% to programmers and staff and overhead sounds about right. Hopefully they manage to eek out a profit to stick around.<p>They&#x27;ll be greatly missed if all that&#x27;s left one day is iHeartRadio and the same old industry pushing the same old method of selecting hits.<p>Pandora is undeniably a good way to listen to music, and all anyone wants is to ensure they have a fair way to compete.<p>No one likes seeing artists go hungry. But we all also recognize that if there&#x27;s anyone being unfair to artists, it&#x27;s the mega industry from the prior era.<p>The new industry involves artists owning their work and paying $50/year at TuneCore or similar companies to get their music distributed to companies such as Pandora. Or, they sign up to traditional album sellers like BandCamp or CDBaby. It&#x27;s simply the most efficient way to do it now.<p>Absolutely we appreciate the music industry for almost a century of fantastic art and culture.

If you are into gaming, graphics or the history of id Software... order it today.<p>Here are some excerpts from the book that I particularly enjoyed:<p><i>&quot;On a cold winter day, Carmack laced up his shoes, slipped on his jacket, and headed out into the Madison snow. The town was blanketed in the stuff, cars caked in frost, trees dangling ice. Carmack endured the chill because he had no car; he&#x27;d sold the MGB long before. It was easy enough for him to shut out the weather, just like he could, when necessary, shut Tom and Romero&#x27;s antics out of his mind. He was on a mission.<p>Carmack stepped into the local bank and requested a cashier&#x27;s check for $11,000. The money was for a NeXT computer, the latest machine from Steve Jobs, cocreator of Apple. The NeXT, a stealth black cube, surpassed the promise of Jobs&#x27;s earlier machines by incorporating NeXTSTEP, a powerful system tailor-made for custom software development. The market for PCs and games was exploding, and this was the perfect tool to create more dynamic titles for the increasingly viable gaming platform. It was the ultimate Christmas present for the ultimate in young graphics programmers, Carmack.&quot;</i><p>Of course, the book wouldn&#x27;t be complete without Ferrari details and discussion:<p><i>&quot;At a showroom, they admired a gleaming new Testarossa that listed at $90,000. Carmack was treating cars like he treated his games; he had already grown somewhat tired of his current engine. What he really wanted was one of these. [...] Carmack paid cash for a red one to match his 328.<p>[...]<p>But Carmack&#x27;s Ferrari didn&#x27;t stay in the lot for long. Within days he drove it over to Norwood Autocraft and started on the modifications - he wanted to get the car, which ran at four hundred horsepower, at least twice as strong. Bob Norwood, who had become Carmack&#x27;s automotive mentor, had a master plan: to install a twin turbo system that would not just double but triple the car&#x27;s horsepower. For added energy, they put in a computer-controlled device that would inject a burst of nitrous oxide.&quot;</i>",1372283333

Judge looks at vandalism statute, finds that it doesn&#x27;t conflict with First Amendment (and i should note here in passing that the First Amendment right is <i>not</i> unlimited; if you think it is, please give me your address so I can spray graffiti on your house). Now that the judge has issued his ruling on the law, he&#x27;s disposed of the question and Defense counsel is forbidden to bring it up again.<p>In criminal trials, the judge makes decisions about what are matters of law. The jury makes decisions about matters of fact, because the jury members are typically not trained in law, whereas judges are. If you lose a case and appeal, then in the appeal court you must make your argument to the appelate judges on points of law - there is no jury in an appeal court. So the appellant argues that in a case like this, the trial judge misread the law. On the other hand, you <i>can&#x27;t</i> bring up issues of fact at appeal, absent new evidence; if the judge conducted the trial properly but a jury rendered a verdict you don&#x27;t like, too bad - there are some exceptions to this, but they&#x27;re highly unusual.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t know that I agree with the judge&#x27;s decision in this case, because I&#x27;m not sure that an impermanent thing like a chalk writing ought to count as vandalism (although I haven&#x27;t researched this or read the judge&#x27;s decision onthat). But even though I may disagree with the judge&#x27;s conclusion on law, the fact is that he&#x27;s made his decision and now he wants to get on with the trial. The proper place to dispute that decision is in the court of appeals. defense counsel <i>knows this perfectly well</i> and probably has the appeal paperwork already written and ready to file, but it&#x27;s easier to put on his shocked face for the public and hope that it raises awareness of his client&#x27;s case.",1372282277

(the positive view is that it&#x27;s also possible that class indicators are becoming less important.)<p>The problem was that they confused cause with effect, and decided that we should put a bunch of effort into getting degrees for poor people.  This diluted the degree as a class indicator.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t have a degree or rich parents, so obviously, I haven&#x27;t seen the parts of the job market that rely on those class markers.  I&#x27;m the riff-raff that those filters are designed to keep out.<p>However, from where I stand? most individual contributor jobs in my industry that I&#x27;m actually qualified for are open to me.   In the tech sector, the value of a degree is smaller than actual work experience.  (I mean, if you actually /learned/ something while getting that degree, that&#x27;s pretty valuable.   But the paper itself is not.)  Internships?  they are paid.  Maybe not paid a lot, but something, and the real companies usually pay substantially.<p>As far as I can tell, unpaid internships are &#x27;class marker inflation&#x27;  -   &quot;Not only did my parents have enough cash to put me through four years of art history, and the contacts to get me this internship,  they could support me while I worked for free!&quot;",1372281684

5949074,comment,5948738,5948738,3,0,betterunix,,,"Frankly, I think the value of formal education is underrated by both hackers <i>and university professors</i>.  CS departments generally have low expectations of their students, with the exception of the &quot;Top 5&quot; schools.  I have been on either side of this:  as a teenager, I was self-taught and learned how to program by writing thousands of lines of code, and in college and grad school, I received a formal education in computer science, but I had to go out and learn more about the topics my courses covered on my own.  A formal education is immensely valuable to writing more than just mundane code.<p>The key problem with being self-taught is that it is up to you to find the things you should be learning.  It is very easy to miss whole topics that may be interesting or enlightening, or may even change how you think about programming.  Here is an example of something I would never have known without a formal education:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming</a><p>It is easy to gloss over it, but this is a <i>completely different way to think about programming</i>.  You might not see it used much in the real world, but it opens your mind to a new way to think about problem solving and can help a lot in understanding other things (like model checking or natural language processing).<p>There is also the matter of understanding certain abstract concepts that are very important in both theory and practice.  Asymptotic analysis comes to mind here, though even a lot of people with formal educations seem to have trouble with it (probably because they thought their theory courses were a waste of time).  Algorithms and data structures are also prominent examples of things that are easy for self-taught programmers to miss, especially those that are not included in their favorite languages&#x27; standard libraries.<p>All-in-all, I think the best programmers are those who have both a formal education and who can and do learn on their own.  Self-taught programmers usually know their language of choice at a deep level; coupled with a formal education, you can do a lot.",1372280970

That being said, he would most definitely not make a good President.<p>Richard Stallman is the same way. Is it a terrible idea to take all of his ideas and mold the programming community in his image? Yes. It would be impractical and completely insane to expect everyone to work for free.

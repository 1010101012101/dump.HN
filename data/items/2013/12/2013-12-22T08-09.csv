6949792,comment,6949474,6949623,1,0,grogenaut,,,"I would suggest that you pick the language that you and the interviewer are both the most comfortable that doesn&#x27;t make you look like an idiot because you barely know it. So for instance if you know java/c++/javascript and the interviewer is a Java coder, go with java. Don&#x27;t pick some language you are messing around with on the weekend.<p>It may be a bit counter-intuitive but the person doing the interview can have about as much mental overhead as you while solving the problem. They are likely writing down the answer you are giving and their thoughts on how you are doing. They also have to see where they think you are going to make a mistake and decide if/how to guide you to keep you on track. They also have to handle different styles of answering the question and have to know very quickly if it will work. So using a language they are comfortable with makes it easier on them and since in then end the job comes down to how they &quot;feel&quot; about your performance, making them feel better during the interview is going to help.<p>That said I did do an interview for a gaming company in ruby because I didn&#x27;t want to embarrass myself in c++ (which I barely knew at the time). They said after I took the job that it was hard to evaluate me because I was coding in ruby on the board and they were unfamilliar with it. Also I got several &quot;You can do that in ruby?&quot; questions. And one shake of the head when I defined a ease of use method on Hash on the fly to make the solution read nicer.",1387702334

Yes, your business needs to make decisions based on data, this is not terribly new. To think that you only have one data store is a bit short-sighted.<p>Many businesses (including startups) have moved to using document stores for high read environments and scraping nightly drops to their backend analytics systems. This is smart - you don&#x27;t want to run summing/aggregation on a live transactional system for (hopefully) obvious reasons.<p>EDIT: it&#x27;s also worth noting that map/reduce is typically much more powerful when aggregating large datasets. When trying to run analytics on top of a transactional system, developers like Ray here would end up with multiple joins and groupings - all of which slow <i>everything</i> down. Map/reduce certainly isn&#x27;t perfect, but the author dismisses it as difficult witchcraft when, in practice, parallel execution of MR queries can greatly decrease resources and time to information.<p>I sort of think we&#x27;ve moved beyond this discussion.",1387701095

Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, that made public a fuller scope of the surveillance and data collection programs put in place after the Sept. 11 attacks, sensitive secrets remained at risk in any courtroom discussion of their details — like whether the plaintiffs were targets of intelligence collection or whether particular telecommunications providers like AT&T and Verizon had helped the agency.</i><p>The only one who THINKS that it is <i>unknown</i> whether AT&T and Verizon were obliged by the government to hand over data is the government[1].<p>I remember when Wikileaks released the cables and US government employees were not <i>allowed</i> to read them. The rest of the world, was reading them anytime though.<p>In the world of governance I&#x27;d expect rationale to be above everything else. Apparently that&#x27;s not the case in today&#x27;s world. USA it&#x27;s just another example, in Greece where I live, common sense has long been gone by politicians and population...<p>[1] However, there is a minor detail here. If this fact gets court proof, maybe some government members would be in terrible trouble.

The agent then calculates a tax based off a blended index of the website&#x27;s size and uniqueness. Because squatters don&#x27;t have the resources to make all of their sites unique they will get taxed hard. Big websites like Facebook and Twitter are unique but they are also large, so they could be levied a larger amount to support the agent which will presumably require a lot of server power. Small, unique sites would barely get taxed at all.<p>Just an idea.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Agents\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Agents</a>",1387699420

The Nest site has some info[0]:<p><i>Hushing works differently during an emergency. If Nest Protect detects emergency levels of smoke, it will sound an alarm that can’t be hushed, by regulation. However, you can hush the other Nest Protects in the house by pressing the button on the Nest Protect that detected the problem. So, when you press the Nest button on the Nest Protect in the bedroom, it will continue to alarm, but the Nest Protect in the living room will quiet down. We designed Nest Protect to hush this way so you can more easily communicate with other people in the house during an emergency while still being able to locate and address the source of the problem.</i><p>0: <a href=""https://nest.com/support/article/What-types-of-alarms-can-I-silence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nest.com/support/article/What-types-of-alarms-can-I-...</a>",1423879102

Some guys wrote a paper about how the Java memory model was bogus and not right for multithreaded programming and they fixed it. C++ got around to this ten years later.  Thanks to the global interpreter lock and lots of old GNU libraries that will never be treadsafe you can&#x27;t do anything with threads in Python, Ruby, Javascript or other common interpreted languages.<p>The JVM team sees many tough challenges ahead and they are doing the hard work to make real solutions.<p>The strength of the JVM is so great that it is the ideal target for languages like Scala and Clojure and Groovy so if you can&#x27;t stand Java syntax you have great alternatives -- and you still have access to all the amazing open source libraries that exist in Java,  including the ability to plug into and interoperate with anything on the planet.",1423879094

It&#x27;s a fascinating view into what users are really doing with your product.<p><spoilers follow><p>And, I&#x27;m really impressed with the filmmaking skill exhibited in this short video.  The transition between walking with the camera and setting it down to rip the smoke alarm off the ceiling is perfect, and the framing there is great.  As the film proceeds, Brad&#x27;s breathing becomes more apparent and faster, as the tension builds to a climax of automatons screaming &quot;emergency&quot; and &quot;can&#x27;t be hushed here, can&#x27;t be hushed here hushed here&quot;.  I also appreciate the exposure as Brad walks into the garage to find an improvised grave for his machine overlords; completely black, and out of the blackness comes an insulated water cooler, perfectly sized for the smoke alarms.  Finally, I like how the anger, tension, and action escalates progressively through the film.  It starts off with some walking around, and gradually becomes more violent.  The timing is just perfect.<p>Perhaps not intentional, but it&#x27;s just so wonderful.  This should be submitted to a film festival.  It&#x27;s the most fascinating &quot;home video&quot; I&#x27;ve seen in ages.<p>(Edit to add one more thing: I think the real genius is the computerized voice, not quite speaking with casual American English rhythm, telling the user that they can&#x27;t do the exact action they requested by physically pressing a button.  Obviously, Stanley Kubrick beat Brad to the punch by a few years, but it still works.  And this is real life, not fiction.)",1423877793

The alarm went off, and it was really loud.<p>I looked at how to hush it, and couldn&#x27;t figure out how.  My alarm was too high up to safely climb up and press the button -- I had paid for somebody to install it safely before.<p>So I called their support, and they told me they couldn&#x27;t legally add a feature to turn it off.  Which is a bit bewildering, considering that wave-to-hush had been a launch feature (albeit removed for apparent reliability issues).  So I had to dangerously climb up high and remove the alarm and take out the battery.<p>But the worst thing?  It never alerted my phone.<p>I have my own theories about why this happened.  I had recovered my iPhone and not logged back into the Nest app, which I think is required for notifications to start flowing again.<p>But the support guy thought Nest engineering would be back in touch with me to discuss this crucial flaw within two weeks.  Months later, I&#x27;ve not heard back.<p>Nest had a ton of options after the thermostat.  It feels like they put a smaller B team on the smoke detector, despite it being a critically important safety device.

9048324,comment,9047833,9047833,0,0,bronz,,,"OK, I have done a little Googling. The evidence boils down to only a few verifiable facts.<p>In the Bay Area, a van registered to apple was spotted. The van was mounted with hardware that is unmistakably designed for car automation, namely spinning cameras at the front and rear. It is basically conclusive that the car is a self driving prototype and not something for apple maps. There is video of that van linked below. This is not conclusive evidence that Apple has intentions to enter the EV market, though.<p>Recently, Apple has hired people from the automotive industry, including some from Tesla (Articles that state this as fact cite linkedin, so I am assuming it is true). Basically, based on the qualifications and expertise of these hires, it can be concluded that Apple is not assigning them to work on CarPlay, which is the only known alternative. (I have not verified this myself but feel that it is OK to accept as true for the time being).<p>As far as I could tell everything else out there is speculation or not verifiable. There are various instances of bloggers and reporters claiming that they have gotten word from Apple employees that Apple is exploring the possibility of entering the EV market. These employees have all remained anonymous and there is no evidence that their claims are genuine or accurate.<p>My own conclusion is that there is a strong possibility that Apple is attempting to enter the EV market in some way. Let us ignore the evidence that has come to the surface as of late. The EV market has a lot of growth left and a lot of unclaimed territory. Apple has a lot of cash sitting around, a relative familiarity with power electronics and most importantly a very strong leader, Tim Cook. Apple is large and old but it does not appear to be fragmented and it is, IMHO, still capable of pouncing on new opportunities and markets. The means, motive, and opportunity all seem to exist in the case of Apple and EVs. And bringing the recent observations back into the equation only appears to strengthen the hypothesis.<p>video of van:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lhU54nhyyk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lhU54nhyyk</a><p><a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2015/02/04/mysterious-apple-car/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macrumors.com/2015/02/04/mysterious-apple-car/</a><p><a href=""http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/apple-is-working-on-a-car"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/apple-is-working-on-a...</a><p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-employee-well-give-tesla-a-run-for-its-money-2015-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-employee-well-give-tesl...</a><p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-more-evidence-that-apple-could-be-working-on-a-car-2015-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-more-evidence-that-appl...</a><p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-testing-street-view-competitor-2015-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-testing-street-view-com...</a>",1423877391

Any JVM language would be suit your needs better in some way.<p>>That is a surprising statement, especially since you don&#x27;t necessarily have any idea what my needs are.<p>Look we&#x27;ve probably exhausted this discussion and are talking past eachother, but I do want to point out that this is a simple misunderstanding.<p>I meant &quot;you&quot; in the sense of the archaic english &quot;one&quot;\n&quot;If one uses C or C++ and one does not care about performance one has performed a premature optimisation.&quot; It sounds terribly old-fashioned expressed like this but I guess the meaning is clearer given the way &quot;you&quot; is overloaded to mean you singular (you yourself), you plural (you and your admirers) and you in the sense of 2. here: <a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/you"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/you</a> &quot;one; anyone; people in general&quot;<p>I obviously have no knowledge or opinion about choices made specifically by yourself, and we are in total agreement that holding an opinion on such would be ridiculous in the extreme.<p>You might find this interesting, it highlights the problem I&#x27;m talking about with exceptions by a guy who has done it in c++ with amazing success, likes the language and appreciates its defects as well as its strengths:\n<a href=""http://250bpm.com/blog:4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://250bpm.com/blog:4</a><p>Where you are writing those pieces of code in your program that caused you to rationally choose C or C++ as your language (ie has to perform & caching is important), the STL is a bad option because it wasn&#x27;t designed for your use, it was designed for everybody&#x27;s use and you pay for everybody else&#x27;s use and their architecture choices and so on none of which you are using! So uou pay when you <i>don&#x27;t</i> use! This is kind of supposed to be what doesn&#x27;t happen in low level languages. Good C++ code in such a case bears more than a passing resemblance to C and the fact that this is possible is one of the greatest strengths of C++.<p>If you&#x27;re writing pieces of code that were largely irrelevant in your choice of C++ as a language and if that was the <i>only</i> code you were writing in this project you could have happily chosen a higer level language, the STL is just dandy, use it, write your code fast and forget about its performance as totally uninteresting to your problem.<p>More interesting is where you&#x27;re not sure, &quot;a deque could be good enough here and will save me time to write.&quot; How do you know if it&#x27;s good enough. Big O don&#x27;t help you. You should be able to run a canned benchmark you understand on the hardware you&#x27;re targeting so you have an idea of &quot;good enough&quot; or &quot;won&#x27;t cut it, need to implement a ring buffer&quot; or whatever. Instead you have to write that yourself or just ouija board. So we duplicate masses of effort from conscientious c++ hackers and simultaneously encourage ouija board decisions. C++ could and should do better. Stepanov&#x27;s container benchmarks? Is a sorted vector with unique run on it better than a set, ok. Very limited in its <i>general</i> usefulness, for what are supposed to be general solutions. But yeah, about 200 more tests like it for different access patterns, insertion patterns, payload sizes and so on is what is required.<p>Here is Mike Acton (knowingly) wildly overstating the case for audience effect at cppcon last year. On the standards of these lectures this one is an absolute tour de force. Definitely worth your and any C++ hacker&#x27;s time. Look up Alexandrescou&#x27;s lecture on optimisation at the same conference as a benchmark to see just how good it is.\n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc</a>",1423876691

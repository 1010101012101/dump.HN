2564074,comment,2563732,2563732,-4,0,peterwwillis,,,"I'll just skip to the juicy bits:<p>1.1.2 Minimize Software to Minimize Vulnerability<p>Really, NSA? So you enjoy tracking down broken package dependencies, installing software 5x a week as developers need it (thus slowing down their development time), and not having the tools to troubleshoot downed systems when they're down (and potentially without access to Yum)? Not to mention having to USE YUM, which is in itself not a fate i'd wish on anyone. If you actually audit and secure stupid stuff like excess running network services and setuid-root binaries you are left with one thing: usermode applications which cannot be used for any attacks. Thus it's not only annoying to not have software already on the box, it's stupid too.<p>2.1.1.1 Disk Partitioning<p>Are you people really stuck in 1998? Are we really still making a separate partition for /boot? Look, guys. BIOSes could access disks past the 1024th sector like 10 years ago. And for christ's sake, nobody has ever been saved from having a 4GB /var/log partition and a 20GB / partition. The disk space is finite. If you run out, YOU'VE RUN OUT. Just make one bigass partition and <i>IMPLEMENT DISK SPACE MONITORING</i> and clean up your crappy logs before the disk runs out. If /var fills up you're fucked anyway, so might as well give it as much space as possible.<p>2.1.1.2 Boot Loader Configuration<p>Oh my god, HOW could we possibly be secure without a password to BOOT OUR MACHINE. The damn disks and boot partition aren't even encrypted, guys! This is useless! If i'm at the machine trying to change the boot configuration i'm just gonna remove the hard drive or use a jump drive and get at the data myself!<p>2.2.1 Restrict Partition Mount Options<p>OK, they redeem themselves here on the partition shit. I still think /tmp should be tmpfs or a swap partition, but whatever. Mounting user-writeable partitions with nodev,nosuid,noexec is actually a really effective and easy way to prevent payloads from being dropped and executed. Of course you can still just buffer overflow and have at whatever service you want, but it makes it much more annoying for attackers as they can't just download a payload to disk and run it. Of course this also means you can't scp scripts as a normal user and run them; you'd need to make a special account that can write to / or some other directory which can execute scripts, so you can copy admin tools/scripts there on the fly for maintenance etc.<p>2.3.5 Protect Physical Console Access<p>Again, this is stupid. BIOS password? I'll just remove the CMOS battery. Boot loader password? I'll use a jump drive or remove the hard drive (or put in my own and boot to it, then access your disk).<p>2.5.3.1 Disable Support for IPv6 unless Needed<p>Too lazy to use ip6tables, huh? Yeah you're right, we'll never need IPv6.<p>2.5.4.1 How TCP Wrapper Protects Services<p>REALLY, NSA? Allow only specific IPs or hosts? Are we really talking about fucking TCP wrappers? If you rely on TCP wrappers you should probably be fired.<p>3.5.1 Disable OpenSSH Server if Possible<p>....how the hell am I supposed to maintain the system then? Use Rsh? Just hope that nothing ever goes wrong so I never have to log in to troubleshoot?<p>Clearly somebody just decided to list every single commonly-available-at-install ""security feature"" found in modern Linux distros instead of showing how to implement security best practices and a structure of limited access control on available services (combined with robust configuration management). Yes this is all very nice for beginners, but if you're really trying to secure a machine you shouldn't be giving the task to a beginner.",1305816739

2564071,comment,2563480,2563958,1,0,Silhouette,,,"I think several of your anti-anonymity examples are flawed. For example, if voting in elections were truly anonymous, anyone could vote many times over. In practice, they know very well who has voted, as they must to make sure the election is properly conducted. What they can't do is associate <i>how</i> someone voted with that person.<p>(Except that actually they often can, because in many electoral systems the ballot papers are numbered and they can in theory figure out who got which paper. You are protected in this case only by the separation of the electoral register-ballot paper index from the ballot paper-vote cast connection, making it another excellent example of how sharing limited data with independent parties can be fine but combining that data in the hands of a single party can have unintended consequences.)",1305816696

2564062,comment,2562800,2562800,2,0,premchai21,,,"The big problem with mmap seems to be handling I/O errors.  The most transparent uses of mmap are for executables.  Failing to page in part of the program can probably reasonably result in a crash.  But what of a server process handling a pile of different data on unreliable disks?  Destroying the entire process on a single I/O error isn't ideal.<p>On Windows it seems like the best way to handle these errors is by either embedding SEH into the surrounding code or adding a vectored exception handler globally.  On Unix, you have to set a SIGBUS signal handler.  But then, mmap is apparently not guaranteed to be async-signal-safe if you want to remap a zero page over the broken one, and longjmp out of a signal handler is its own pile of potatoes; both seem to work on various modern Unixoids, but I haven't been able to find documentation saying that they'll continue to work.  And with longjmp, or on Windows (where you can't remap pages over other pages directly, that I know of), any surrounding code that accesses the map needs to be abortable all the way up to a suitable error point rather than just having to handle bogus values. Much code assumes that a simple memory access will not cause a <i>recoverable</i> exception that may result in rentering the code later.<p>And if you're in a library on Unix, good luck getting permission from the main process to alter signal handlers.  The hook mechanism isn't as rich as that in Windows, so with the exception of large application framework libraries that are expected to take over the process anyway, it's an invasive and possibly irreversible activity.<p>This is all sad, because I love the idea of mmap.  I was tinkering with a C library for accessing certain kinds of files, and I want to do it with all mmap, but I'm not sure I can overcome the I/O error problem adequately.  (The blocking and address space problems are not too bad here; they impact performance and capacity, but not correctness.)",1305816462

Some people would love to avoid it completely. For example, I just came back from Spain and I saw a debate, which was none after all, on TV about the need to identify everybody to prevent slander.<p>I firmly believe that anonymity is in many cases the only tool to express oneself, like when power asymmetries or divergence from social conventions make such an expression extremely expensive.<p>Anonymity is fundamental for democracy. If it was not, there would be no secret voting. Other examples in which anonymity is obviously required are when you need an honest opinion which could be affected by power asymmetry (rate your professor, give your employer some feedback, etc); when the subject matter requires privacy (sexual behavior poll); and so on.<p>Dealing with anonymity in the internet is not easy.

Normally, HIV uses the CCR5 receptors to enter white blood cells, in which it replicates. However, in some people the genes that generate that receptor are mutated, with a small portion being deleted. It still works for most of the things the immune system does, but HIV is no longer able to enter cells through it (I'm not entirely sure if it's unable to enter or just unable to enter anywhere near as well; the former would suggest total immunity while the later would be partial immunity).<p>See also <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCR5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCR5</a>",1305814384

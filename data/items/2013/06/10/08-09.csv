5853138,comment,5851791,5852989,2,0,einhverfr,,,"Metadata cannot be protected as well as the actual content can.  One of the keys of good security is to ask what has to be compromised for your data to be compromised, though.  If you have SSL-protected connections, BCG hijacking alone isn&#x27;t going to reveal your communications but BCG hijacking along with a fake certificate issued by a trusted CA under court order or merely voluntarily) would allow a MITM attack.<p>The thing is, if you have your own CA, and expect certs from both sides from the same CA, then it is very hard for an MITM attack of this sort to be orchestrated because you can say, &quot;Something isn&#x27;t right here.&quot;  So that leaves attacks against the cyphers involved or against the endpoints.<p>One service we offer is an ability to use an SSL cert issued by the customer, as well as appropriate VPN options to connect to the system at all.  Between these, in general I would expect that MITM approaches can be protected against in high security configurations.  But that still leaves cyphers and endpoints.<p>So the first thing we need is a better PKI which can more robustly handle fraudulent certificates.  This is something I have written about a bit.  (see my blog, <a href=""http://ledgersmbdev.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ledgersmbdev.blogspot.com</a> for more.)  But we also need a lot more.<p>BTW, we build everything on the basis of compartmentalized security with the idea that compromising customer data will require working through quite a bit of depth, particularly in relatively high security configurations.  It wouldn&#x27;t protect against a court order, but it should protect against a lot of other things.<p>Could the NSA hack us?  I am sure they could.  Could we make it difficult enough that they would be much better going through legal channels (maybe making deals with local law enforcement or the like)?  That&#x27;s what I am shooting for.  It is probably the best one really can shoot for.",1370854282

I don&#x27;t think spending more time and money on AI is a winning proposition for them.<p>On the theoretical side, I have a tiny bit of AI research under my belt, so I can make a few comments.  The problem is simply that current AI techniques are geared towards solving isolated, &quot;relatively simple&quot; problems.  These individual problems can be surprisingly complex, such as creating a very good algorithm for how to &quot;micro&quot; certain combinations Starcraft units.  Even though there are ridiculous numbers of combinations, our current AI techniques are good enough to solve these.<p>The problem comes in when you try to combine multiple elements together.  Combine your &quot;micro&quot;-algorithm with a general scouting and build order strategy, as well as having some kind of high-level decision making strategy which ties it all together...  essentially this results in the complexity of each part being multiplied together.  The number of combinations goes from &quot;barely computable&quot; to &quot;won&#x27;t happen, ever&quot;.  What we actually need is something which is able to detect boundaries within the search space, decide where to start up new sub-algorithms, and how to combine them.  To my knowledge, this field isn&#x27;t very mature yet.<p>I believe we&#x27;ll be getting interesting clues from how biological intelligences solve this problem within our lifetimes (not to say it will be completed solved by then).

Facebook has only proven that to an extent that you simply can&#x27;t deny it anymore.<p>If fools use PGP/GPG, they will compromise you by putting the message in the subject and encrypting their disclaimer/footer.<p>OTR uses, iirc, AES and DH-kex, that are the same basic building blocks like RSA and AES or any other symmetric cipher you like to use for PGP/GPG/SSL. OTR adds deniability which is fancy for privacy but won&#x27;t do for other scenarios (like business, money, profit), it works fine in one to one sessions, but group sessions are off the record.<p>We can conclude that OTR is fine for chat, sorry to hear google dropped the interoperability protocol in hangouts, take a wild guess why.<p>PGP/GPG can sent to group-messages (one message encryped for multiple recipients and may optional provide proof of the sender), does not imply any protocol like XMPP, and stores messags in a secure manner too. The drawback is, you have to take care of your private-key and your friens, partners, business-associates public-keys.<p>If somebody really inists that key management sucks with GPG/PGP let them do some key management and distribution only with a symmetric cipher.<p>Key-Managment with PGP/GPG is a light, soft breeze compared to that. Some people even used it as an excuse to party.<p>I understand why people have dropped privacy and anonmyity, it is no fun to follow procedure and there are so less benefits compared to every other social media app, it is so comfy to state you have nothing to hide and not care about the implications.<p>With PGP/GPG you won&#x27;t have 600 friends, that means caring about 600 keys, that is basically one revoke a week if you are lucky and all you friends master crypto and revoking and getting their new key signed.<p>If you want to understand a bit crypto it may take a good tutor to teach you the very basic concepts and history of using crypto within 2 schooldays, 16h (and they&#x27;ll hate you afterwards and they won&#x27;t pay that).",1370852194

Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;d do it if I had to set one up.<p>The Chrome extension would prevent gmail from reading the email fields, preventing the saving of drafts server-side. On sending the email it would encrypt the content with a key that is unique per receiving address. If the client has the extension installed it can decrypt the contents automatically on display.<p>The problem is getting the decryption key across to the recipient securely, but that only has to be done once. After that the browser extension can hold it indefinitely. It could be done with a trusted third party site, which only holds the key for a very short time, and only for the first email sent to a new recipient. Power users could of course use their own ways of getting keys across.",1370852113

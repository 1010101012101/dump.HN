It may be alive inside some companies' intranets but it seems to be dead on the public web.<p>When I've developed APIs, people clamor for JSON, REST, and serialized PHP. Maybe I'm in some non-Microsoft, non-Java ghetto?",1228031798
380754,comment,380324,380324,0,0,vegai,,,"Sometimes I have to spend a lot of time in RHEL or Solaris hunting down packages of software that I would find and install in Arch in a minute.<p>I haven't had worse problems with Arch than with 'real production server operating systems' like the two above. I am developing my personal stuff on a VPS running Arch.<p>archlinux.org runs on Arch. We had some downtime earlier this month, but I think it wasn't software related.<p>Business guys, however, don't want something new and cool. They want a conract that allows them to yell at other people when things go wrong. That's why Arch might be a tough sell sometimes. Perhaps an idea for somebody's startup, mm? :)",1228031690
380753,comment,380681,380681,0,0,newt0311,,,"Its not functional programming per se but higher level languages in general. Most scheme and lisp environments already come with high-level abstractions which completely obviate the need for any obvious design pattern (like visitor, etc...) and lisp is by no means a functional language (though it does incorporate many aspects of functional languages).",1228031586

380749,comment,380722,380722,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Sun has been doing all the right things...but several years too late.<p>They've Open Sourced Solaris, but they seem to expect good package management to simply spring into existence (or they expect people to pretend like their pkg tools are an acceptable substitute for package management, since they've put a shiny GUI on top of it...but a highly polished turd is still a turd).  I thought when they hired Ian Murdock, there would be an instant move towards apt-get and dpkg on Solaris, which would be a huge step in the right direction (I like yum/RPM better, but both are perfectly acceptable).<p>There's seemingly a belief within Sun that Solaris is <i>so good</i> that people will beat a path to their door now that it's Open.  The problem is that it exhibits a complete lack of comprehension of what makes Linux so much better for the vast majority of users.  Linux is so much more adaptable than Solaris...and it all comes down to how many nicely packaged applications are available for Linux, instantly.  So, for all the great stuff in Solaris (and there's plenty to be excited about: ZFS, dtrace, Zones), it's simply not an acceptable substitute for Linux, and the folks who are in a position to fix it are utterly oblivious to how badly they're failing.<p>So, I expect the folks at Sun will get packaging figured out three or four years from now...and at that point Solaris will be even less relevant than it is today.",1228031191

380746,comment,380686,380686,0,0,sh1mmer,,,"To put this in perspective the largest Hadoop cluster Yahoo (or anyone) has spun up is 4000 2.5ghz dual-processor quad-core Xeons. According to <a href=""http://www.clustervision.com/cluster_hardware.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clustervision.com/cluster_hardware.html</a> a Xeon runs about 4 flops per cycle. That means the entire cluster was running at about 20 megaflops.<p>The smallest computer on that map is 27 teraflops. More than a factor of 1000 on our cluster.<p>That said, raw power isn't everything. I know we were all impressed with Google's recent TB processing record, which prove the old adage <i>it's not how big it is, it's what you do with it</i>.",1228030643

Then the web site operator uses the password used by the user (who uses the same one everywhere) to work their way into an account.

Nope, they just rebranded: ""Our mission is to improve the health of babies by preventing birth defects, premature birth, and infant mortality.""<p>I'm quite sure that the global warming brigade would quickly find alternate employment if it turned out to not be the devil.

380736,comment,379111,379617,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I guess my perspective is slightly warped.  I have a dog.  A big dog.  Which limits my options <i>dramatically</i>.  But, I would have assumed that the perspective was similarly warped for SF, since she's coming with me to SF, as well, but perhaps there are simply more dog-friendly options in the city.<p>I will say that I'm now kinda shocked by how ridiculous the paperwork is for most SF rentals.  They want huge swaths of banking data.  Far more than I had to provide for any other place I've ever lived (even <i>buying</i> a house in Austin wasn't this intrusive).  I've talked about the topic with my landlord (who wasn't too intrusive when I moved in here, and has been mostly great and hands off), and he said it all boils down to how hard it is to evict someone in California.  Since throwing someone out takes as much several months after they stop paying or do something else against the rules, the property owners do everything they can to insure they never have to throw their tenants out.  But, I still find it horribly annoying.",1228029440

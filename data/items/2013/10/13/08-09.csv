6541936,comment,6541167,6541486,4,0,vidarh,,,"(EDIT: Downvoting doesn&#x27;t make the claims in the references comment any less wrong. How about arguing the point instead)<p>I stopped taking that comment remotely seriously when it claimed:<p>> As a matter of fact, it is a well known and well documented phenomenon in the literature that if you train at close to maximal capacity on the same training regimen for longer than 3 to 4 weeks, you will stop making gains. You&#x27;ll see big increases the first 3 weeks, and after that, nothing. This is a nervous system effect.<p>... which most people who have done heavy weight lifting for example can tell you is at best wildly misleading, and at worst, pure, unadulterated bullshit.<p>To flatten out after 3-4 weeks would take such extreme over-training, at stress levels way beyond what even most high level athletes would normally even able to achieve in training, that it is extremely unrealistic for most people to every experience it. Certainly not &quot;just&quot; by training at something until you feel you can&#x27;t do any more. At that point most people are not anywhere near a real maximum.<p>I don&#x27;t lift to a &quot;training&quot; 1RM (maximum weight I can at any time lift once) every week, much less manage/try to stress myself into a real max. (the reason for distinguishing these, is that it is normal that you can lift up to 10% +/- more in high stress situations like competitions), so maybe what I do don&#x27;t count in that guys eyes. But I exercise large compound lifts to near failure (that is, until I have good reason to think that I will be unable to complete the next repetition) every workout - 3-4 times a week. So I&#x27;ll hit my training 5RM, 3RM, 1RM for the various lifts on consecutive weeks. They are reasonably interchangeable. If I feel good enough, I may go for a 1RM to try to set a new personal record even if it&#x27;s not the &quot;right week&quot;.<p>And see slow but steady improvement for months on end before I shake anything up, and when I do change things, it is mainly for other reasons - some progressions may follow the same program for <i>years</i>. Changing too often does not help - it just confuses you tracking.<p>Most people are far more likely to run into limitations due to form/technique failures or lack of flexibility that they need to fix than due to any CNS limitations.<p>Gains do slow down as you get closer to your limits, and you certainly <i>can</i> over-train, but it takes a <i>lot</i> to over-train so badly that you stop seeing gains after 4 weeks even when you massively brutalise major muscle groups on a semi-daily basis. I can&#x27;t even imagine what you&#x27;d need to do to overload your nervous system from typing in that short time-span.",1381654642

6541934,comment,6541313,6541313,1,0,Smudge,,,"In my experience, when developers start bringing up &quot;maintainability&quot; during feature discussions or code reviews it has less to do with a particular feature (though that might be what prompts the discussion) and more about the current state of the product.<p>Sure, we as for-profit developers write code so that, ultimately, it can generate revenue. But if work is only ever allocated to pursue immediate business value, the team may find itself slowly drowning in technical debt. New features take longer and longer to develop, and often it&#x27;s hard to point to an exact cause of the problem, leading to debates about the &quot;maintainability&quot; of single features when the real problem is the product as a whole.",1381654627

6541930,comment,6541167,6541167,1,0,TerraHertz,,,"Although I completely agree that QWERTY is poor and Workman looks like a very good system, I&#x27;m in my late 50s and think it would be a painfully slow process to get used to a different key layout. And I don&#x27;t seem to get RSI.<p>But what does really steam me about keyboards in general, is the numeric keypad. I&#x27;m right handed, so the mouse sits to the right of the keyboard. And of course the mouse gets used a lot. Which means my right hand is always swinging back and forth from RH keyboard home and the mouse.<p>Now it happens that I _never_ use the numeric keypad. Never have to enter large blocks of numeric data, and so am quite happy using the numeric top row. Used to it that way, and don&#x27;t see anything wrong with it. So to reach the mouse I&#x27;m moving much further than I should have to, across the wasted space of the numeric keypad. Also if desk space is a bit tight I keep hitting the mouse on the RH side of the keyboard - again because of that extra length to the right.<p>It&#x27;s a workspace centering thing too - the main area of the keyboard should sit on the centerline of the screen, to avoid small but persistent twisting of the spine and neck. But then the keyboard R end sticks way out, and the mouse movement field gets pushed further to the right.<p>It&#x27;s been bugging me increasingly for years. I&#x27;ve found a few &#x27;small&#x27; format keyboards without the numeric pad, but the designers always go overboard and think that &#x27;small&#x27; means everything on the keyboard ought to be small - smaller keys, thin base therefore short key travel and terrible touch feedback, flat keytops (another pet hate - you get no tactile feeling of centering, and so have to keep watching your fingers type), compressed layouts of the existing keys (arrrgh!), and so on.<p>What I really, really want, is something like an old klunky and reliable IBM (like I&#x27;m typing on now) but with no numeric pad. No other change.<p>I&#x27;d long ago have simply taken a hacksaw to a standard keyboard and cut the numeric pad off, except guess where the controller IC _always_ is in keyboards? Right above the numeric keypad, of course.<p>It&#x27;s so annoying! Why does no one, that I&#x27;ve ever been able to find, make a full size, heavy, long-key-travel, concave key-tops, easy-typing, standard layout (or Workman layout!) keyboard without that stupid numeric keypad?<p>In these days of USB it&#x27;s especially dumb, since if someone really wanted a keypad as well they could just buy a separate keypad and plug it into a USB port. There&#x27;s NO reason why it must be included in every damned keyboard in existence.<p>If anyone knows of such a thing for sale, I&#x27;d very much like to hear it. I&#x27;d buy several.",1381654359

I&#x27;ve not been very disciplined about doing practice every day.<p>I&#x27;m only using it on my Microsoft Natural 4000 ergonomic keyboard, and still using a regular QWERTY bog-standard-dell keyboard at work, which means I can still type pretty effectively on colleagues&#x27; computers.<p>I quite like it.  It does seem to make a lot of sense.<p>Switching back and forth between a normal QWERTY board and Workman-on-a-special-board takes at most one sentence of brain-mush, but then it&#x27;s fine.<p>The thing which slows me down the most I think is programming in VIM. I&#x27;m not going to remap anything, as all the commands I think of as sentences (c)hange-(i)nside-(t)ag, (d)elete-(t)il, etc.  And there&#x27;s a lot of muscle memory to overcome.  Also with sh commands.<p>Still, I do like it.<p>One of the reasons I decided to go for Workman rather than one of the alternatives is that the whole column-layout for physical keyboards seems like a better design in general, so one day, if I can afford it, I will try and get one.<p>I have been really struggling with RSI for a years now, so along with changing layout, I&#x27;m also trying to take more breaks, sit with a better posture, etc.  It does seem to be helping.<p>After 2 months of very irregular typing on it, this also being my first time doing &#x27;formal&#x27; touch typing, I&#x27;m around 50wpm typing normal prose, which still feels a bit slow to me, but I am improving.",1381653958

Although related, they are not the same concepts.<p>My opinion is that you can have both performance and consistency, and work your way toward scalability as required. I recall that Facebook has a very high server-per-engineer ratio (though I acknowledge that the user-per-engineer ratio is even higher in comparison to other startups).<p>I also realize it is not cost-efficient to write bugfree software, but saying they did it the other way on purpose is forgiving them too much. You never write bad software <i>intentionally</i>.<p>They didn&#x27;t care, and the world should have relied and should continue to rely on better software.",1381652302

Increase the nutrient density of your diets: instant weight loss and health gain.\nPeople might eat a little healthier in The Netherlands than the USA, but honestly all Western countries could improve a lot on this.<p>This article makes the mistake that greater body length equals  healthier lifespan.

That doesn&#x27;t mean you may expect &quot;a fully grown alpha male to take his chances&quot; in the way it happened here.<p>As someone&#x27;s boss, you don&#x27;t french-kiss someone then-and-there, on the bar, in front of colleagues and peers. That&#x27;s not just taking chances, that&#x27;s a display of dominance over both her and the colleagues and peers. It&#x27;s true ape-like behavior and most people aren&#x27;t prepared for that anymore, in any context. No matter how drunk they were, most present would still have gone: &quot;WTF is happening here?&quot; when that happened in front of them.<p>Now bypassing that, accepting that this has happened, then the following is still baffling. She isn&#x27;t reciprocating. You cannot not notice that and you should back down at that point.<p>Bypassing that, accepting that he didn&#x27;t notice or severely misjudged, then you still don&#x27;t engage in sexual behavior right then-and-there, in the open. There are only few persons in few circumstances that enjoy such public displays of sexual behavior. Most people wouldn&#x27;t ever, in any state of mind, with any girl, perform this behavior. They wouldn&#x27;t do it if the girl was naked and asking for it. Let alone if she was clothed and her feelings towards such behavior were entirely unknown.<p>> she could have easily denied him the opportunity<p>In your abstraction of what happened and an abstraction of human beings, she could have. In the actual situation, with actual people and all their idiosynchrasies and their history together: no, she couldn&#x27;t. She didn&#x27;t. And in the end that still boils down to this: the fact that she didn&#x27;t resist does not mean she is guilty and he is innocent. He behaved like an asshole, whether she resisted or not. He shouldn&#x27;t have behaved like that, whether she resisted or not. Most people would never in their right or drunken minds behave like that or wish others to behave like that.

Also they insist that you return the car with the gas tank empty the. They charge you 120€ to fill a small car.

One of the main reasons I used to port my games to OS X was that promotion on Apple's website would bring in $20k+, well worth the cost of a port. An App Store would only increase the incentive develop for OS X.<p>A <i>mandatory</i> App Store, like this article suggests? Like younata said, that would be insane.",1272189403

1292479,comment,1292279,1292447,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"The problem with nuclear power is that no one wants the plants anywhere near them.  That severely limits how much power we can get out of that option (especially as the population continues to grow).  At the same time they raise the fear of terrorist attacks which make them even less likely to be built (which is ironic since to the best of my knowledge no one's ever actually attacked a nuclear plant).<p>There's a reason why a new plant hasn't been approved for almost 30 years (though hopefully that will change with Georgia's planned new plants: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/business/energy-environment/17nukes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/business/energy-environmen...</a>).  I mean, let's be realistic here the state of Nevada created such a backlash against burying nuclear waste within a 100 miles of civilization that it actually became an issue in the Presidential debates.<p>As for being ""deeply ashamed"" of the U.S. putting weapons in space again I point out that space based weapons present no greater threat than Earth based ones and if we're going to put assets up in Space than we'll need to protect them.<p>The idea that there will never be weapons in space disappears as soon as Earth based missiles can attack assets in space.",1272189327

1292476,comment,1292241,1292460,0,0,devinj,,,"There is no ""human logic"". Logic is logic. It encompasses thoughts both natural and foreign. Who, for example, really finds the Banach-Tarski paradox intuitive? And yet it's logical. In fact, it follows from somewhat intuitive logical rules. But, hell, we can throw those out, too. We can accept a logic that, for example, rejects the entire concept of implication and the principle of explosion. A logic which can have two contradictory things both be true, without causing the system itself to fail. The limits of logic have nothing to do with what is natural to humans.<p>Axioms are not things that exist just floating in space, but neither are they things that only exist to a human mind. Logical implications can be defined, and inferred, in a useful way that applies to systems that don't understand logic at all! Even if aliens thought in a way entirely, well, ""alien"" to us, they could <i>still</i> be described by logic, even if they themselves found the idea patently ridiculous, because even their formation followed physical laws, and their development followed biological laws.<p>Perhaps not laws that we are familiar with. Perhaps the life we hypothetically encounter is just one monolithic life-form that developed in solitude on a planet, and self-developed. Normal rules of evolution do not apply when there is only one creature. But, that's not to say that there were no rules. For to survive, it still must have done something right. And in a universe with some known laws, what is right to survive can be surmised quickly: it obviously didn't jump into its sun right away and perish. Suicide cannot coexist with life. So already we can figure out one thing: this singular life-form that ""evolved"" in such a strange manner does not commit suicide.\nOther aspects might be harder to find. Is it peaceful? There's no way of knowing. Whether it's peaceful or not has nothing to do with whether it survived and developed to get here, because it developed entirely in solitude. But, is it very sociable? Almost certainly not. A thing that has never before seen other life won't even comprehend what it is to be social. It's just like us examining quantum physics. What on earth is going on? We can't understand things totally outside of our experience except by analogy and coincidence, and here there is almost definitely no analogy, only a freak coincidence of mental structure.<p>So you see, we can reason about things logically, even if they are alien. We've reasoned about quantum mechanics, despite never seeing it, and despite <i>never even</i> understanding <i>it</i>. We've reasoned about single-celled organisms, things that are incapable of even <i>thinking</i>. We have reasoned about automata and machines, about chemical and nuclear reactions on a scale so far beyond the realm of our comprehension that we can never hope to appreciate it on anything more than a dumb, primitive level. We do it even if we don't understand, because the tools of logic are universal. Not by virtue of some belief or god, but simply because things have patterns. Even alien things.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach-Tarski_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach-Tarski_paradox</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraconsistent_logic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraconsistent_logic</a>",1272189167

I would <i>like</i> to think that aliens, whether or not they inhabit the same rough space and time as we do, would follow the same logic, the same science of right, which we humans have, but I would still be making the assumption based on life on one single planet, where only one tool making species someday maybe capable of interstellar travel.

If they chose different sides, the &#x27;mismatcher&#x27; wins.<p>&quot;How can a pair &quot;outperform&quot; another?&quot;<p>A player is better at the game the closer to a game theory optimal strategy they use. This would presumably be to chose left or right at random. The worst strategy would be to always chose the same side, the matcher would then be able to predict your next move with 100% accuracy.<p>Randomizing choices to be unpredictable is something humans aren&#x27;t good at. Poker players sometimes use tricks like checking the position of the second hand of their watch to do this (e.g. if it&#x27;s between 10 and 12, bet, if not, check).

If you come from a PC or UNIX background then there are conventions regarding how the mouse works - context menu is right click, not some weird keyboard + mouse convention.<p>People like me have avoided the Apple product for many reasons with the mouse problem high up the list. What I don&#x27;t understand is why they have offered weirder and weirder mice over the years, all with reliability problems and ergonomic woes, with no option to just get a regular mouse. They could have hooked up with Logitech and made an Apple mouse for PC users, with the buttons in the right place and a novelty fruit logo to make it look desktop-worthy. They could have charged £25 for it and, people that have avoided the Apple cult due to the weird mouse could have been brought on-board.<p>I know I am not alone in disliking the Apple interface, I am actually the one person that likes Ubuntu Unity, however there are lots of PC users out there that just do a job and haven&#x27;t the patience/need to learn the Apple mouse oddities. At a presentation or tutorial if the machine is an Apple then the non-Apple people get stuck on basic things like using a web browser or saving a file.<p>I am a big fan of Steve Krug&#x27;s &#x27;Don&#x27;t Make Me Think!&#x27; book:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321...</a><p>The problem with the Apple interface choices is that it does make me think, but not in the right way. I just want to do the task in hand and not wonder why it is that you have to hold down some cryptic key on the keyboard to do a right click.<p>I also noted in this article how many of the failures of the various Apple mice could be ignored so easily by someone in the Apple cult. Underlying this is a problem with understanding what truly great design actually is.<p>That really boring Logitech or Microsoft mouse is actually great design. The ergonomics are a treat as is the reliability. They have been bold enough to make something that actually works rather than something that looks pretty.",1402174333

If it is to express a feeling, fine, she did express her feeling. If it is to make a point, she shouldn&#x27;t, or one might simply say she cannot have a rational discussion, because it simply doesn&#x27;t prove anything. Google didn&#x27;t use insult, it undisclosed private information. While it is senseless, it&#x27;s not an offense, in the sense that there&#x27;s no proof that it was intended to hurt. I don&#x27;t believe that S. Brin woke up one day with the idea of harming people, or do you think that is what happened? If it were the case: if I had been the victim of a deliberate attempt at hurting me by disclosing things about me that I consider private, I would be seriously pissed. The question is: was it deliberate, or was it simply an error, or a misunderstanding? People make mistakes, that&#x27;s unfortunate, but it&#x27;s understandable.

That obviously means some data structure has to track all these unique forests - store them, ensure uniqueness etc. Usually this is some implementation of a set. In Scala for example, a HashSet[(Int,Int,Int)] would be the obvious choice. Unfortunately, finding all these forests & adding them to the set to ensure uniqueness will also ensure your code buckles down to its knees.

He says that the mouse is not the best, but it led to the creation of better things like the magic mouse. In fact, the article is about so much more than just a mouse.<p>The ending quote :<p>&quot;But in terms of visual richness, the Apple Pro Mouse is still in a league of its own. This mouse remains as one of the most magical products I’ve ever seen. And the magic doesn’t just come from its mystifying appearance; it’s magical because it exists. For most products, clarity becomes fogged up with doubt and lack of ambition. They have no opinion, are overly apologetic as they are designed to satisfy too many people. Steve Jobs didn’t believe in this approach. He made the zero button mouse a reality, and in tandem created the most simple, elegant operating system possible. The Apple Pro Mouse wants to exist in the future, where everything is intuitive. It’s so much of an bullish product that it wasn’t till the Magic Mouse that we truly understood what its intentions were. It’s a huge statement but makes no excuses for believing in what’s right. And this truly epitomizes what made Apple so special under Jobs. &quot;<p>So it&#x27;s more a commentary on what made / makes Apple great.<p>I liked this quote as well:<p>&quot;Regardless of what you may think of the Apple Pro Mouse, I believe that there’s something admirable about its stubbornness. It’s like a masterful chef that’s owned a restaurant for decades and refuses to change their ways (Sukiyabashi Jiro comes to mind). If everyone was that stubborn, society wouldn’t function, but it’s these people with strong beliefs that help the rest of society ground their opinions. When so much of the world produces apologetic, impartial products, we need some stuff that pushes our notions forward. The mice that Apple made were just that.&quot;<p>So I guess, instead of just talking about the mouse we could talk about what the article is actually about: making amazing products that have opinions and don&#x27;t try to please everyone, having this vision for how things should be and just building that with whats possible!

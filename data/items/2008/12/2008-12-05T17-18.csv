387315,comment,387171,387171,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Let me sum up my impression of this article:<p>A. Agile methods are just common sense.<p>B. My company has no common sense, so it treats the agile methods as some sort of religion, and thereby remains completely dysfunctional.<p>C. I am in hell and need something to shout at. If I shout at my coworkers I will get fired. But there is a consultant within shouting distance.<p>D. My life sucks and it's all the fault of the Agile Methodologists!<p>If anyone ever wonders why management consultants charge all that money: This is it. Would <i>you</i> want to walk into this guy's company and try to give advice? You'd have to be awfully well paid!<p>The author is on the path to enlightenment, but he is not yet there. He's figured out that the capital-M Methodology  is primarily designed for broken companies. [1] He's well on his way to figuring out that he's working in a broken company himself, which is why there are so many people employing Methodology there. What he hasn't figured out is that you can't fix a broken company by walking up to people and telling them ""you aren't writing documentation or using the bug tracker because you aren't a very talented coder and you have no common sense"". I have <i>seen this management style tried</i>, and it doesn't work: it just makes everyone unhappier, and it focuses their unhappiness on you.<p>If you want to tinker with a dysfunctional company instead of just running for the hills, you need to (a) recruit allies, (b) equip your allies with powerful Jedi mind tricks that they can use on their less-enlightened management, and (c) find ways to maneuver problematic people out of the way of your allies -- or, if necessary, destroy them. This is why there is always a Methodology lying around -- and why, when one dies, another is always there to take its place. A Methodology is a rhetorical weapon, designed for just these purposes.<p>(a) It's not an accident that Methodologies evolve cultlike features. So does every effort to recruit a bunch of people to a cause, whether it's a fraternity, a political movement, a school of software development, a message board for hackers, or, you know, an actual cult. ""Join me and we will fix the company.""<p>(b) The Methodology eventually evolves expensive consultants in suits, and industry-standard buzzwords and rituals whose magical powers are strong and unquestioned. This is important. If your buzzwords aren't magic, nobody will listen to you unless they have common sense, which is very unreliable. Remember when Java was on the uptake, and you couldn't sell anything to a corporation unless it somehow involved J2EE? ""Don't worry, Higher Management. We are not merely employing our own native talent and common sense. We are using an Accepted Methodology as endorsed by Higher Powers. You don't need to see our identification; these aren't the droids you're looking for.""<p>(c) I have never heard of a ""Scrum Manager"" before, and I agree that he or she has a very silly name, but I think I already know what this person is for. This person is there to provide a second manager that is empowered to talk back to the first one, who may well be clueless (at least part of the time). The original poster actually understands this. He just doesn't accept it. He has yet to accept that occasionally-clueless managers, let alone <i>permanently</i> clueless managers, are a fact of life. He seems to think that you can somehow <i>avoid having</i> clueless managers, or fix them by appealing to their <i>common sense</i>. [2] Give him time. Someday he will stop bemoaning the needless existence of powerful weapons and start learning how to use them. ""Mister Manager, sir, if you don't stop insisting on screwing up our work I'm going to have our Scrum Manager report you to the Methodology Police.""<p>Unfortunately, like Harry Potter's magic or the Force, Methodology is just a tool. The fact that people are using it all the time, brandishing its most powerful aspects in broad daylight, doesn't mean that things are going well or that the forces of good are necessarily going to win out. Quite the opposite, really. Someone whose projects are well-managed will appear to be living a comfortable, slightly boring life in his home in the swamp, and will rarely be heard employing a Methodology out loud.<p>---<p>[1] As opposed to garden-variety methodology, which is fine and -- for the talented -- is just ""common sense"".<p>[2] Those of us without nominal managers -- startup co-founders and independent consultants -- shouldn't feel too smug here. Clueless customers and clueless clients can be every bit as problematic as clueless managers.",1228499437

Like Windows, MacOSX has a huge API, and each time you want to do a different task - networking, multilanguage support, undo/redo, working with bitmaps, scrolling, file support, etc etc etc, you have to stop programming, and look it all up.  Sometimes you may even be sucked into having to read a 300 page document, although that is thankfully quite rare once you are no longer a beginner on the system.  But then, each time that I do one of these things, I'm always thankful for the framework's existance, because I can't help but be aware of the fact that it is saving me probably months of work to create my own system.<p>Maybe his problem is that he is underestimating the size of the problems that the different systems are solving under the hood.  Like, he talks about VB6 apps, from memory those don't scale so well if you have more than a handful of users using the app at the same time (I may be wrong about this, it's just what I seem to remember from that time - I wasn't actively working on those types of app at the time).  Much of the complexity of today's systems is designed to permit you to handle scaling to hundreds/thousands/millions of users, with correspondingly huge amounts of data being handled.",1228498935

Yup, I think that around about covers it.  I would have phrased it a little differently though. Basically, in just about any endeavour, you only get the really big reward if you sell your product directly to the people that use your product.  So, music artists sell directly to the people that listen to the music (well, they earn a percentage share of direct sales).  Startup founders also sell their products directly to the end user.<p>But as soon as you become an employee, earning a salary, you aren't selling directly to the end user, you are selling your skills to your company, which then produces a product that is used by the end user.  Or worse still, you are selling your skills to a company that produces a tool that is sold to another company that is finally used to do something deemed useful by the end user.  The longer that chain is, the less likely you are to get paid what you are worth if you are above average.  Why?  Because the entity that is buying your product doesn't actually care about the product, so if you have made it three times better than it would have been without you, don't care - just as long as it meets the minimum specification necessary to be able to sell it to the next person in the chain.  On the other hand, if you are selling directly to the end user, they certainly appreciate the product that goes above and beyond minimum spec - insert Apple/Ferrari story here...<p>I can think of only one special case exception to this rule, and that is sports stars - and they are a special case because they are the only market where you actually have to beat the competition to be considered as performing.  That means that there is a massive advantage in having someone on your team's payroll that is just slightly better than the other guy - you only have to be slightly better to win, and winner takes all.",1228498068

Chaos theory guarantees that everything has <i>an</i> effect on climate. The AGW hysteria is that mankind's contribution <i>dominates</i> everything else and that we're looking at massive (2C+) warming on a relatively short timescale.<p>Admitting that mankind's signal can be masked by natural variations already means that mankind's signal, rather than dominating, is merely one of many other signals that have an effect, and that already logically means two things: It caps the effect our signal can be having, and it means that thanks to the fact that there are ""so many unknowns"", it means that the hypothesis that we're hardly having any effect at all remains at a significant probability of being true.<p>Even admitting that our signal can be masked takes out the worst-case hysteria. ""Mankind has less effect on the climate than natural vulcanism by an order of magnitude"" hardly says ""spend trillions of dollars and break your economies to prevent that effect"" to me.<p>""Watts up with That"" earlier this year posted the predictions made by the IPCC from a few years ago, and showed that we're on the verge of falling off the bottom of their confidence interval this year, and if next year is even flat (let alone cooler) we will. If we do fall off the bottom next year, that doesn't mean that ""natural variations are masking the global warming signal"". It means ""You guys didn't predict these variations, therefore your models are just plain <i>wrong</i>, and therefore your models may not be referenced for the purposes of extracting a putative 'global warming signal'.""<p>Wrong models = wrong science. It does not equal ""science that's still right if you just look hard enough"". If climate scientists ten years ago couldn't predict a cooling event, then they are in absolutely no position to be predicting 100 years in advance, no matter how much they babble on. That's not just common sense, it's <i>science</i> too, no matter how many words they throw at you.<p>Truthfully, judging science from the outside isn't that hard if you stick to ""Did your predictions come true?"" ""Predictions are hard!"" isn't a defense when your predictions fail; they still failed.<p>Keep an eye out over the next couple of years. If they stay cold or get colder, write AGW off until they radically, <i>radically</i> improve their science. The uncertainty will simply be too low to worry about when we have plenty of real problems (like the Pacific dead zone or overfishing or...) to worry about.

People who write code that is difficult to maintain should make more money by virtue of being harder to eliminate. I don't think effective programmers document everything either, but maybe this is an unpopular opinion.<p>What sets really productive people apart in my experience is architecture and domain vision. This is certainly the lesson in the Viaweb example. Without good architecture innovation consists of ""feature creep"". You've got a good thing when you find yourself with changes that simplify a code base or system while increasing its power.<p>I suspect this is why people who develop their own tools are often seen by others are great programmers, and why Eric Raymond's definition of a hacker is someone who builds their own tools. I'm a worse programmer than a lot of people, but am orders upon orders of magnitude faster than anyone else in my niche domain by virtue of knowing how to do things and leverage existing assets. I assume really good programmers are leveraging their expertise in other areas too.<p>If this is true, I'd argue that what keeps the good people from earning higher multiples is that architecture and vision don't matter in a lot of cases. Companies that innovate less have less need for development characterized by rapid innovation. Systems get developed by spec and implemented by indifferent teams. You budget for the features you want, not the flexibility you need. Innovation matters more to smaller companies, but even there non-technical individuals rarely see the architecture through the interface.

Now think about the difference to a band that only plays out in local clubs and might sell a few CDs. That rock star who plays to millions of people might not be as ""good"" as the local band but they are generating a lot more value.  Now think about the programmer who is 10x better than a ""not so good"" programmer... is the end result of the 10x better programing worth 10x more value in the end?  Even if they are generating 10x more value - I think that the value generated by real rock star is 100s or 1000s of times more than the local band.  So do ""rockstar"" programmers create a 100x or 1000x more value than a ""not as good programmer"" does for a company - great rockstars do, great sport players do, great actors do...",1228497356

387255,comment,386910,387027,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Sort of.  It's not about who sets the pay rates - otherwise, actors and sports figures wouldn't get their $multimillion salaries, since it's the movie execs and team owners that set the pay.  It <i>is</i> about negotiating leverage.<p>When a company hires a CEO, they usually decide <i>who</i> they want first, and then they negotiate over price.  There are few substitutes for their choice - usually, a company will find only a handful of candidates that are suitable for the position.  This gives the CEO enormous leverage.  There's only one of them, yet there are probably a couple companies that want to have them as CEO, so the price goes up.<p>Similarly, brand-name actors can drive moviegoers to theaters just by their name alone.  There is only one Brad Pitt, but there are several movies that would love to have Brad Pitt star in them.  Dakota Fanning gets like $4M/movie, because her name alone ensures the movie would get more attention than it otherwise would.  David Beckham got a $250M contract, even though he's kinda washed up, because his reputation means people will watch.<p>An average programmer is filling a role, however.  If they ask for too much money, the company just goes out and gets a different programmer.  At hiring time, they don't know who'll be 10x more productive, unless that programmer already has a strong brand behind them.<p>I'm very curious to know how much ""brand name"" programmers like Peter Norvig or Guido van Rossum get paid.  There are many Python programmers, but there is only one Guido, and many places that want him.  I'm guessing I'll never find out, though.<p>BTW, this is behind a lot of the career advice that Internet celebrities give.  Seth Godin's ""you should throw away your resume"" really means ""your personal brand should be strong enough that employers want <i>you</i> and aren't just filling a position.""  Paul Graham's ""work hard at things that excite you"" is because if you do so, people will notice (eventually), and then they'll want <i>you</i> for what you've done and not just any old programmer.  Marc Andreesen says ""set the controls for the heart of sun"" because that's the work that people notice, and that'll make you stand out from the crowd.",1228497020

If we could convince elected officials to do this sort of analysis, we might be able to weed out a lot of the unnecessary inefficiencies.<p>That said, the solution to an overabundance of regulations is not necessarily to utterly eliminate them, and the lack of perfection should never be an excuse for not performing an action when the consequences of inaction are worse.<p>I won't pretend to know what should or shouldn't have happened in the current financial crisis.

I'm not going to take apart his piece, because I too am sick of the manifesto and believe that the top dogs are just in this as a marketing exercise.<p>Having said that, Agile was not put together by those guys. That's just what their books say. Agile techniques have been being used for decades. They just didn't have the cool marketing term. You don't have to drink the coolaid to be agile -- any high-performing team is going to be agile, whether they call themselves that or not.<p>Second, Agile is a philosophy, not a methodology. It doesn't tell you what to do, it tells you what to think about what you're doing. Agile/Lean IS just common sense, but nobody seems to have much common sense anymore. You can apply the agile philosophy to all sorts of methodologies.<p>Third, Agile is not for mushy-headed enterprise guys. It probably works better for small customer-facing shops. To say agile is a response to CMM or heavy-handed processes is again to buy into the story the book-writers want to tell you. Put down the crack pipe. Agile has always been around, and has been used inside of all kinds of other methodologies.<p>Finally, Scrum is NOT agile. Scrum is a project management framework that you can use for agile projects. You can use a lot of others, or you can roll your own. The Scum guys are the religious nuts in this circus, if you ask me, and they are the ones causing all of the backlash. The rest of the Agile movement is just about how to best iteratively and incrementally do your job. That's a good conversation to have.<p>Ironically, a key factor I'm finding in successful agile teams is the ability to be open-minded. If you are an agile disciple or evangelist, or if you are a anti-agilista, usually it gets in the way of team performance. It's the people who want to have an ongoing conversation about how to keep increasing team performance -- without getting hung up over what book it was in or not -- that grow killer teams.",1228496490

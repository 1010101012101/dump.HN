I think it's just about keeping the relationship age appropriate.<p>When one is a baby, they need everything taken care of for them. Once you become a toddler, you can probably eat by yourself if someone puts it down in front of you. By the time you're 6 or 8, you can usually do fine in the house all on your own for a few hours at a time, and so on.<p>The main problem is when you're a teenager, I think, because you think you know everything and your parents can realize all of the stupid crap you're doing, so there's a big clash there, but once you progress through that stage, things are easier again, as long as your parents are willing to give you an appropriate amount of space.<p>I think moving out _can_ be important and helpful. I just think that our society is too judgmental of some who've chosen that they prefer to be under the same roof as their parents. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, as long as both parties are sensible regarding it.",1252097937

Veterans that I've known often have not developed their abilities at building a consensus, getting people to buy in, or pushing responsibility and decision making down to the people in the trenches.  In some environments that can be a real problem.  (Ironically the problems seem to be invisible to the people causing it.)<p>This is not a slam on veterans.  My point is that many different corporate cultures work well.  However a mismatch between employee and culture tends to fail badly.  And graduates of the military culture are not going to work in all corporate cultures.<p>It is worth re-reading the article with this in mind.  Many of the companies listed that recruiters avoid are great companies.  Companies like Oracle, Coca-Cola and Intel are world class and clearly work very well.

And even base Linux and FreeBSD are ""simpler"" (until you add OpenSSH, Apache, and the NFS stack). Win7 has baggage; MSFT is still paying for the DCOM mistake.<p>You have to counter that, though, with the hundreds of thousands of dollars Microsoft spends on security testing every functional unit of the shipping product. It is not unpossible that they paid someone at Leviathan, iSEC, or IOActive to spend a week auditing Minesweeper (they haven't paid us to do that).<p>They don't just audit their code. A couple times a year, they do a little internal conference called ""Blue Hat"" (<i>pace</i> Black Hat), which, as the beauty pageant for all their consulting vendors, tends to get the best researchers from those firms as speakers. They highlight trends and findings for execs, and try to get some of the benefit of the audits spread across multiple projects.<p>There's also an entire layer of researchers, testers, and project managers on top of the security tests. Some of those people (like Leblanc and Howard) are actively turning the results into curricula for training, or for new code standards, or even changes in the shipping VC++ config. Other people develop automated testing tools. Still others develop better, more secure APIs.<p>When you think of the resources Google has, you assume that the best developers there all have access to a MapReduce cluster that will run their ""hello world"" test programs against the corpus of the entire Internet as of I dunno 3 weeks ago. Only Google has that resource. Microsoft has more ongoing security test results than any other company in the world --- even moreso because they had so. much. catching. up. to. do. from the late '90s. That has to be a killer resource for them.<p>So, we'll see. I wouldn't run a Microsoft OS as a server, for a lot of reasons. But I have more respect for the work they're doing --- and the intentionality of that work --- than I do for a lot of Unix security projects.<p><i>Everything</i> OpenBSD did to fix NetBSD's security in the '90s, Microsoft adopted on a massive scale, and then spent tens of millions of dollars to improve.<p>Sorry for the long comment, I just don't want to come off like I'm sniping at you, or trying to start an OS war.",1252097588

I also know people who live at home with their parents with the intention of saving up money to put a down payment on a house (a few have done that). But I also know some people who have spent themselves into debt even while working and living at home, guaranteeing that they won't be leaving any time soon.<p>I don't think it's possible right now for the average person to do what our parents or grandparents typically did (get married, buy a house, have 2.5 kids, and send them to college) at as early an age as they did.<p>All of these life events have become insanely expensive by our parents' standards:<p>Marriage: avg. wedding cost in the US is now about 30k, avg. ring is about 5k. (I'm not saying this makes sense, I'm just saying this is where money is allocated.)<p>House: avg. housing costs are still up over historical norms and anyone who was able to buy their first house in the last few years is probably upside down on payments.<p>Kids: More expensive than they used to be. All signs point to dramatically increased costs across the board: health insurance, clothing, education, activities, and food.<p>College: College prices have bubbled as much as housing and the cost of a degree has nearly doubled in 15 years. By the time your kids take the plunge, it may have doubled again.<p>And this is on top of individuals carrying higher levels of debt from all of these events later into their lives even while real world wages have stagnated.<p>All indications point to jobs trickling back into the economy more slowly than they left. My only hope is that a good portion of those who are stuck at home are working on ways to extricate themselves (startups, consulting, freelancing, etc.).",1252097476

One of the disadvantages of not thinking in language is that I think it is very difficult to just apply a rule or formula to your thought process when you don't fundamentally understand what the formula is doing at a deeper level. If your models are not being stored in your head as language abstractions, you can't really apply a language abstracted formula to it. Another related problem is that I essentially have no memory for the things other people memorize with ease. I memorize concepts, motions and relationships but I cannot memorize 'labels' at all. I do not know my own phone number for example (2 years with my current one). So yes, I think trivial understanding is difficult with this model because you cannot just catalog a bunch of stock responses and rules for dealing with a certain topic, but deep understanding is far easier because you are not abstracting the underlying principals in a layer of obfuscation, the mental model is a simulation of the system rather than a description. I was useless in calculus until I started visualizing everything in terms of momentum and volume changing over time. Then it started to work. When it was memorize and record, I was useless.

805572,comment,803578,803578,0,0,eldenbishop,,,"The ""cross-browser"" compatibility is greatly exaggerated by adobe and ""widget"" programmers who don't have to do heavy application programming. I have been working with a large team for two years on a website with heavy flex integration and we have had far more browser incompatibility problems with the Flex than the HTML/Javascript portions. Rendering is very consistent across browsers but the network stack is largely handed off to the browser which introduces all kinds of problems. Also, things like transparency and background mode can massively degrade in the wrong browser/OS pair which means testing all of your supported platforms for performance and turning off features accordingly. The network stack is very hard to get right on all browsers. Big surprises like Internet Explorer can't parse an XML file over HTTPS if caching is disabled for the resource. Thats right. Now considering that virtually all XML API calls out there disable caching, this is really annoying. So basically we had to detect when a Flex client was calling our services and remove the no-caching headers. And of course, since you don't want to cache you have to add in a nonce on the url or it will never be called again. Also, Flex can't by default handle anything other than HTTP 200 so better recode all of you server processes to basically be Flex specific, returning Flex friendly HTTP codes and headers. The Flex network stack is simply pathetic. Our QA team tests the Flex application on all supported browsers. They do not even bother anymore with the HTML portion because errors have become so comparatively rare.",1252094637

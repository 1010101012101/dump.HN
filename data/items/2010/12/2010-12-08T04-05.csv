If you haven't encountered it before, you've been lucky.<p>But the crux of your post is what to do. You either 1) get over it, 2) quit, or 3) assuage your discomfort by only using legal software yourself. What you are willing to tolerate is a personal issue and one no-one can judge you for. I'd put up with it, because I've worked with people who've done far worse than copyright violation but I'm not a judgmental kinda guy.<p>P.S. Actually, there's a #4. Try and convert the company into using legally purchased, lower cost apps. If you're on the Mac, both Pixelmator and Acorn are great Photoshop alternatives (within a range of tasks). Problem is, it sounds like you have Windows <i>and</i> Mac gear and lots of people involved.. so it'd be an uphill battle for little direct win.",1291784322

The documentation is spotty at explaining how to property handle it, or maybe it is an issue with the organization of the documentation cause I can't always find what I need, but I know it is there. When I started, I keep hearing the general rule of thumb, ""if you don't alloc/init it, you don't need to release it."" Except no one mentioned you have release properties. I never alloc/init them. Along with that, difference between an ivar and property is poorly documented. The fact that ""aField = x"" is different than ""self.aField = x"" and can mess up memory management was lost on me.<p>My problem with the documentation, as I said before is mostly organization. Along with that, some of these concepts are defined in ways that only make sense if you already know the language and framework.<p>After a couple projects and code reviews, I think I understand it now.

1981941,comment,1980963,1980963,0,0,jerf,,,"It still seems to me the problem is that they tried too hard to wrap the sockets into ""the web"". Just open a standard TCP socket to the web site's specified port and server. Layer me in some automatic SSL negotiation using the site's HTTPS cert (or something signed by it) if you want to win points. (Probably should mandate this, in fact, as it would block off most of the remaining ""forging what site to connect to"" issues; not unless you have the correct SSL info, in which case you've won anyhow.)<p>I'm not sure what proxies are doing involved in sockets at all. I do not see what useful thing you can do with a proxy, except maybe flat-out block web sockets. They can't meaningfully cache, they can't meaningfully enforce policy except with the blindest, stupidest of approaches that should probably be in another layer anyhow. There's not enough structure in a raw socket connection to do anything with, what structure is there could and should be managed by your router.<p>I'm sure there's some massive problem I'm missing here.  (Though if it's ""users can't use websockets through a proxy"", frankly, I don't really see that as a problem that has a solution. By the time you fix up your ""proxy"" to allow ""essentially arbitrary socket connections"" what you've got there is a ""router"". If you're in an environment where you actually must use a proxy for some reason, you're in an environment that is probably going to ban arbitrary socket connections anyhow.) Now's your chance to enlighten me, I guess. I'm not trolling here, I do believe this, but I'm interested in the answers people give too. Maybe someone will convince me. (No joke.)",1291783745

1981937,comment,1980805,1981520,0,0,binaryfinery,,,"I've written memory managers used in console games for the N64 (4Mb), PS2 (32Mb) and a complete memory tracking system for Unreal Engine 3 on XBox360 (OMG 512Mb).<p>I use MonoTouch for iOS development. Why? Because I can build complex object graphs without having to maintain, in my head or in external documentation, the acyclic version of the graph. In a GC language I can create graphs that are happily cyclic, and have every reason to be, and yet have them deallocated when the application nulls the last reference.<p>In a reference counted system that desires cyclic pointers, one or more of those pointers have to be chosen as non-reference-incrementing pointers - and likewise one must remember not to release them either.<p>Memory management in Objective-C (without GC) is no effort provided one is making applications with simple object interactions, such as the plethora of tree-based hierarchies. Reference counting is great for that.<p>So it could be that the OP is lazy, or it could be that they have experience with problems that you do not. If you believe that OP actually requires a lesson on the basic rules of reference counted memory management (since thats what you provided) then I suggest that you are underestimating the experience of your detractors, which in turn leads me to believe that you are overestimating yours.",1291783662

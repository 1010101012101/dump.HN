You're turning Facebook into a Berkshire Hathaway of sorts, with the only coherency being that every company they buy a stake in advertises on Facebook. By that logic, why shouldn't Time Warner start buying stakes in whoever advertises on CNN? Why shouldn't everyone who sells ads do this?<p>Facebook gains no higher CPM from doing this either. I mean, they may make more money if these auxiliary businesses do well. But it's no more than if they kept selling ads on Facebook for 14 cents cpm, set up these side companies, and spent 14 cents cpm advertising them somewhere else. The fact that they own Facebook provides no value whatsoever for the side companies.<p>Effectively you're saying that any company with a non-functioning business model should just do something else too. That doesn't solve the problem.",1208062780

Some random company buying the ads at 10 cents CPM is not always getting traffic that is worth that much 100% of the time.  By actually getting the entire revenue stream, the ""child"" company, and thus its parent would capture the true value of the traffic over a long period of time.",1208062645

Not knowing what to do, I picked up the bills and just stood there awkwardly, holding them out, hoping the person who dropped them would come back and claim them (under the assumption that a random person wouldn't say anything to me holding 14 20's).  I skipped class waiting, and then, not wanting to miss the next class pocketed the money.  Was I wrong?",1208062596

It would have a stake in a company who's core competency is whatever that industry happens to be.<p>The site is indeed relatively worthless, and I doubt anybody at all is paying them a high cpm in <i>anything</i>.  Thats the whole point, to turn low cpm into somewhat higher cpm, <i>in the long term</i> by capturing more of the revenue stream.<p>Is it fool proof?  No way.  Facebook or whatever, could risk losing their investment in whatever company they bring up, and also lose the opportunity cost on whatever ads they could be selling instead of sending to their own child company instead...  But does it stand a better chance at making more money <i>in the long run</i> compared to magical BS like social graphs and social ads?  Yes, I definately think so.",1208061708

Two choice quotes about the language:<p><i>Malbolge was so difficult to understand when it arrived that it took two years for the first Malbolge program to appear. The program was not even written by a human being: it was generated by a beam search algorithm designed by Andrew Cooke and implemented in Lisp.</i><p>and<p><i>Malbolge's probably biggest piece of evilness comes from the encryption of instructions as they are executed. That encryption, fortunately, has a few weaknesses that make writing Malbolge programs feasible. </i>",1208061220

162208,comment,162066,162178,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"But it's not really a higher CPM at all. There's no benefit to Facebook starting a mortgage brokerage and advertising that on Facebook (which apparently isn't a very valuable seller of advertising, or they'd already have decent CPMs) over just switching to a mortgage company entirely and advertising on other social networks. Or better yet, switch to selling mortgages and advertise on sites that are valuable to mortgage brokers.",1208060166
162207,comment,161927,162156,0,0,rbanffy,,,"Pierre... From what you say, it is glaringly obvious you never spent any time either with a Mac or with a modern Linux. True the monitors stuff is not mature, but multi-monitor machines are just now becoming more common. As for OSX being sluggish... What have you been using? a G3?<p>And I find that dropping to the command line is fairly common with me because I am a programmer. My son uses my computer from time to time and he has no idea there is such a thing as a command line. Maybe your sample is skewed by a number of programmers using Linux more than any limitation of the graphical environment.<p>I only agree with you about the Vista thing. It is the lousiest OS I have ever seen being pushed out the door. It's even worse than Windows Me.",1208060078
162206,comment,162066,162066,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"This is very silly. It's a well-known concept in the business world that companies should stick with their core competencies. Ones that try to do too many disparate things at the same time generally fail. Facebook's core competency is not selling mortgages or credit cards.<p>Also, if mortgage brokers are only willing to pay some portion of 14 cents CPM there, that means Facebook is creating very little value for them. Which also means that if Facebook got into the mortgage selling business, they could probably capitalize off of it in much better ways than just advertising it on their relatively worthless site.<p>So in essence, the only industries Facebook would benefit from entering are ones that already pay them a high CPM. But if people were paying them a high CPM, they wouldn't be in this predicament.",1208059967

162201,comment,161927,162085,0,0,rbanffy,,,"Package management goes way beyond installing and uninstalling stuff. A good package manager, like apt or yum, will help your computer self-update (not only the core OS but every program you installed in your computer, through the same interface). It also shines where you don't want to know from where you download a given package - you just ask for the package manager to install it. The good package managers will also deal with dependencies and conflicts between packages, which is something that may not appear when you deal with applications but happens all the time with libraries.<p>You insist there is no need for package management because you never had real package management. The Macintosh method is very simple (much better than the Windows way) but it fails miserably when what you are installing is not an application.",1208059502

They struggled to come up with new products, flailing around.

5831088,comment,5830993,5830993,2,0,luxpir,,,"It is refreshing to see this kind of research promoted, particularly by an 'extremely learned person'. The submission reads to me as a sort of call to arms, as someone who feels that education has been a great privilege and bonus to their life. A privilege which is now unfortunately being sold off to the highest bidder in most countries.<p>From my own experience, learning second/third languages has had a noticeable broadening effect on thinking processes. Not in the proud sense of being 'broad minded', but noticeably better able to engage in abstract concepts.<p>Basically the ability to compare seemingly unrelated notions felt tangibly improved after learning how my speech in English was actually constructed, and how my words and phrases were just $variables for actual concepts. And I'm quite convinced that given the right chances in life, anybody can learn any of a thousand subjects that would have a similar effect.<p>The end benefit to society? Impossible to say for sure, but you can bet good money on the additional creativity being an improvement on the previous generation in terms of progress.<p>This article, and others like it, are great to read but one aspect I would like to see further developed would be the effect of role models and the origin of aspiration in a person. Is it even possible to give more people the desire to want to learn more? Are some people just naturally more 'competitive'? What role does gender play?<p>On a final note, Radio 4 this week interviewed a panel on women going into Physics, in particular. It was a ridiculously low amount, and one of the female panellists excused this with the reasoning that 'girls often prefer biological sciences'. These kind of assumptions, and a complete ignorance of any potential underlying social issues, are what get my goat. So many thanks, Colin, for submitting this.",1370505278

The thing is, though, this is not any real comfort because <i>it doesn't matter.</i><p>The reason we have the 4th Amendment is to keep general warrants like this from being issued, and to help retard the ""show me the man and I will find you the crime"" (to quote a member of the Stalin regime) from taking root here, or at least to make it more difficult.<p>The problem is, for the worst abuses to occur they don't <i>have</i> to store everything.  They just get general warrants like this, inspect packets, filter ""interesting subsets"" out and send those back to Utah.   So I think the actual strategy is two pronged, in a different direction, and both worse and more economical:<p>1.  Vague laws that people can be easily prosecuted for[1] particularly when it comes to terrorism.  Bonus points for allowing military enforcement of domestic law.[2]<p>2.  Get general warrants that let them target whoever they want without recourse, which is what is going on here.  Better yet, let's get retroactive immunity for any accomplices and make sure it is all really above the law.<p>The end result is the same, of course.  The difference is that the above strategy takes a lot less time, resources, money, people, and hardware to pull off.<p>[1]  See Harvey Silverglate (civil liberties atty, veteran of the EFF, ACLU, and FIRE), ""Three Felonies a Day: How the Feds Target the Innocent""<p>[2]  This is a trend, particularly when it comes to defining terrorism but has been going on since at least Clinton.

So there is an environmental factor in what IQ tests measure; this should not be a surprise to anyone. The study suggests that one's environment growing up affects your abstract reasoning ability.

Hell, LTCM failed in 1998 because they were doing big data analyses of small spreads and forgot about some of the holes in their analyses, namely what would happen if a ""black swan"" event moved currency prices out of their historical norms.  Quant hedge funds like DE Shaw, Citadel, and RennTech have been around since the 80s.<p>Heck, back in high school one of the math competitions I won was sponsored by INFORMS (the Institute For Operations Research and the Management Sciences), and I asked my dad ""What's operations research?"" and he said that it's where people with math Ph.Ds go to make big bucks.  Companies like FedEx, Safeway, and WalMart have relied on their massive amounts of operations data to do things like minimize transportation costs or ensure that they're stocking items with maximum demand for decades.<p>The thing is, everybody who gains a competitive advantage from big data has reason to keep that fact secret, so that their competitors don't start doing the same thing.  What's changed now is that the media itself is facing competitors that use big data themselves to make themselves more relevant than traditional media, and so suddenly it's a Story Of Consequence.  It's not that big data is the next big thing - it's that big data was the <i>last</i> big thing that you are only hearing about now, and suddenly a bunch of folks that had never heard of it are now trying to play catch-up.",1370505058

Americans over-eat, abuse prescription drugs, etc. to hide from, effectively, the last 40 years (and what it has led to). The US standard of living has fallen massively since 1970. In the late 1960s our minimum wage was the equivalent of nearly $50,000 in today's dollars.<p>But you're wrong, the average American isn't stupid. You clearly haven't spent enough time with 'average' people. I know a lot of people that fall into the average camp in most respects, they're absolutely not stupid. Being drugged out on anti-depressants doesn't make someone stupid. Making poor choices also does not make someone stupid. In fact, you betray an embarrassing ignorance in saying so.<p>The average American is responsible for one the most productive economies in history (while simultaneously being the largest in history). Said average American manages to live in the most diverse large nation in history, while not constantly murdering each other in the streets by the millions. It's quite a feat that is likely to never be repeated again.<p>What you said isn't racist.

They're also quite smart; they know Facebook lets you chat with your girlfriend.<p>What they're saying is that Facebook is not working the way it should.  It's partially due to its popularity, but it has diminished its usefulness.<p>Try this: Open it up right now and read the first 10 to 20 status updates and then count how many you care about, then count how many are important in any way.  After doing that a few times (and trying to manage what updates I see, to improve things), I closed my account.  (And I'm an extrovert!)<p>We are Hacker News.

Would that more disagreements were of this kind.<p>> Well, for something like bipolar disorder this feels like it's true.<p>I agree. The open question is on what level these things are best to be understood. In some sense everything about us is biology, just as in some sense everything is physics. But we don't think of, say, heart disease as best addressed by physics. Similarly, that there is a biological stratum to our actions and feelings does not automatically mean that chronic emotional suffering is best understood as biology. One might as well conclude from the tongue and larynx that language is biology too. And indeed it is, sort ofyet its meaning lies elsewhere. Or you might as well conclude from the importance of neurons to learning that education is brain biology. Why bother with teachers or schools? We should just 'learn' the neurons directly. Such examples are obviously silly, at least given our current knowledge.<p>To know that chronic emotional suffering is a biological disorder requires more than the involvement of biological phenomena in it; it requires an experimentally verified model. My understanding is that we don't have anything close to that. The one that entered the public imagination, the serotonin-deficiency theory, is widely dismissed by experts [1,2,3,4]. The only argument seems to be whether they knew it was false from the beginning or discovered that it was false decades ago.<p>Yet we insist that modern science has discovered that mental illness is biological just the way that cancer is and so on. What do you call a conclusion like that which goes far beyond what we actually know?<p>It's worth realizing that psychiatry has always made this claim. The grounds for it shift every 20 years or so, and the previous grounds are always dismissed as ludicrous if not harmful (think lobotomies etc.). Nevertheless we're perpetually certain that we're beyond all that now.<p>> But I know that people might get benefit from meds<p>I don't think anyone questions that; the question is whether the benefit is that of a placebo or not. My understanding is that SSRIs are no more effective a treatment for depression than tricyclics were a generation earlier; their advantage is rather that they have fewer side effects [5]. So whatever explanation there is for their efficacy must plausibly explain how both of those (presumably very different?) biochemical mechanisms could do it. Given that even inert placebos produce most of the same effect (Kirsch's finding), the placebo explanation is pretty clearly a major candidate. If there's another, I'd like to know about it.<p>(I realize you were talking primarily about bipolar disorder, but I haven't read about that, so I've continued to talk about depression instead. That may lessen the relevance of the above.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/01/23/145525853/when-it-comes-to-depression-serotonin-isnt-the-whole-story"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/01/23/145525853/when-it...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392.t001/largerimage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal...</a>,\nvia <a href=""http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/blogs/couch-crisis/psychiatry%E2%80%99s-new-brain-mind-and-legend-%E2%80%9Cchemical-imbalance%E2%80%9D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/blogs/couch-crisis/psychiatr...</a>, paywall bypassable by clicking link at <a href=""http://goo.gl/3LxUW"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/3LxUW</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.madinamerica.com/2012/01/revising-the-history-of-the-serotonin-theory-of-depression-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.madinamerica.com/2012/01/revising-the-history-of-...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17636689"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17636689</a>.

All our telecommunications providers are forced to have the capability to intercept all traffic (phone and internet). Encrypted data must be stored for an unlimited time to facilitate possible decryption in the future. Our 'Team Digital Expertise' developed software that profiles social networks on which a suspect operates to use it in order to gather crime-related information.<p>Our police buys TomTom software-data to see when and where they can get the maximum amount of money if they photograph speeding drivers. (Safety is not their first concern, money is). Local and national police now use drones. The army is training how to spy on it's own civilians.<p>Our 'Camera Surveillance Act' allows images to be retained for up to four weeks and also facilitates the use of cameras for law enforcement purposes, <i>whereas before the main purpose of camera surveillance was keeping public order</i>. They're working on a pay-per-mile car tax system but activating it stopped when it turned out they were collecting more (personal) data than was technically needed to run the system and using the data for purposes other than those for which was collected. Every important road is viewed by camera's with license-plate scanning software. You can travel by public transport but a special card with chip and login/logout is required. You can purchase one without your name and address but you can only add money to it using your bank-account. The system tracks all travelers' movements (departure and end points for each leg of every journey), in most cases combined with the traveler's identity. It retains the data for seven years.<p>Our Dutch passport contains both fingerprints, facial recognition and RIFD. Every large city center is equipped with camera's with powerful microphones. Our Minister of the Interior announced plans to also store the biometric data in a central database. Dutch hotels are breaking data protection laws by photocopying guests' passports and identification cards because they are required by our government to do so.<p>The 'Electronic child file' records a child's development and environmental indicators from birth. Teachers are forced to build a profile of every child in their class along with a description of his/her family's situation. It received local media coverage when it turned out doctors are even recording <i>when a child starts getting pubic hair</i>.

It's a bunch of smart people getting together and shooting the breeze about whatever we see on the front page.  If you understand that, you'll fit in fine.<p>Lots of new users here don't understand that.<p>If you spend any time on the internet, you're quickly trained that discussion forums are places for combat.  The goal is to look as smart as possible while tearing everybody else down.  To have an unrefuted comment is to win, and nobody is going to let you do that so they'll tear your comment apart line by line.  Naturally, that person is a moron and needs to be told so, preferably by turning his own trick against him and tearing <i>his</i> comment apart.  Stop me if this sounds familiar.<p>That explains why the hardened slashdot veteran gets such a strange reception here.  Have you ever been at a party where there was a guy who just didn't belong there?  The belligerent know-it-all butting into conversations?  The drunk guy in a room full of sober people?  The uninvited casual racist?  We've all seen what happens.  People drift away from him wherever he goes, sometimes stranding some poor soul talking to him, but generally trying as best as possible to continue the party as normal and hoping he doesn't disrupt it further.  Nobody wants to confront him and ask him to leave directly, but they all sure hope he'd get the hint on his own.<p>That's where we are here today.  Except it's a big room and there are quite a few uninvited intruders behaving badly.  You'll notice that that guy at the party often doesn't realize that he's out of place.  Look through this very thread and you'll spot a few of him, justifying their belligerent behavior and complaining that the rest of us don't get it because this is The Internet and that's how we're supposed to behave.<p>But we don't behave that way.

Perhaps I'm just a naysayer, but until we can figure that out, online dating just isn't working. Apparently almost 75% of US single people have tried online dating. Only 20% have found committed relationships (assuming that's everyone's goal, which it isn't).[1]<p>We need a chemistry detector, not a compatibility detector (machine or human).<p>[1]: quick search leads me to stats from 2012 at <a href=""http://www.statisticbrain.com/online-dating-statistics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.statisticbrain.com/online-dating-statistics/</a>",1370502485

The reason no one cares is because most Americans are in a comatose state.

They're drugged out on corn syrup, anti-depressants, street drugs and seemingly not educated at all about the rest of the world.<p>I know that sounds like I'm talking trash and being racist but this is a real problem.

If 1% of the population of every Congressional district called in over the next week, it would likely put real time pressure on Congressional offices.<p>There are two problems:<p>1.  If we don't call in the only people talking to Congress are those with the money interest, and they can go after the easiest targets.  This is why money currently trumps everything.<p>2.  These form part of the economic structure that keeps the small elite in power.<p>Now, I totally agree with you when you say ""The only hope is to economically empower everyone so that a small elite doesn't form.""  The problem is we have been running the wrong direction since the 30's (I think Roosevelt-era social democracy lead directly to Reagan-era neoliberalism) and with the over-regulation of small businesses and the under-regulation of large businesses that is a tremendous uphill battle.<p>If you sit down and map out the scope of corporate control over our individual lives, you will probably come to the same conclusion I have, that this is not only the vital struggle of our day, but is one we are badly loosing.",1370502318

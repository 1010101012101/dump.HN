There just isn't enough ""new"" to require moving an entire organization to Windows 7 when XP works just fine.  The other problem is that computers have gotten to the point where a low-end model is also good enough for most things.  A 3-5 year old desktop is still a good machine for most office work.  So why would an org buy newer machines to replace ones that work just to run a new version of Windows?<p>When you talk about moving to Mac OS X or Linux, the scenario above falls apart.  Since you're talking about making a major platform shift, there must be a good reason.  Perhaps it's support costs. Perhaps it's productivity (perceived or otherwise). Perhaps it's to get the most out of the hardware you already own with minimal software costs.<p>Once you start to entertain the idea of migrating away from Windows apathy isn't an issue.",1256623162

Namespaces and mixins are vital for building large scale software projects. C++ also allows generic programming (via templates).<p>Java has interfaces and namespaces. Both C++ and Java have static typing, which is a <i>tool</i> for building certain kinds of large scale software projects (dynamic typing -- combined with an actual type system -- as in Python, Ruby or Lisp -- is another tool).<p>Lastly, Java (as well as PHP) are garbage collector. C and C++ don't -- yet many large scale software projects were created without a garbagage collector. Does this mean that you don't gain a lot of power from a garbage collector?<p>C++ and Java are <i>not</i> examples of powerful programming languages either. You <i>don't</i> use them because they're the most powerful and elegant programming languages. Typically, they're used out of HR considerations (""it's easy to hire Java programmers""), performance requirements (C++ is fast; properly tuned JVM can be at most 10% behind C for applications which don't require a large heap) or libraries (although availability of other languages on the JVM overrules that argument as well in many cases).<p>Hate to be blunt, but you're speaking as a <i>Blub Programmer</i>.

It feels like watching someone trying to learn a language by not imitating the sounds they hear when others speak it.<p>But those that i saw who became really good, were always on the other end of the spectrum. Those who jump right in and played /really/ bad without any anxiety or pressure (no thinking at all and mostly just stubborn imitation of moves they saw someone else play before) and fast (many many many games, often not even to the end), almost always sticked to the game long enough to learn to appreciate and enjoy it, and sometimes even managed to excel at it.<p>There's something magical about the fearlessness of just playing.

One of the main problems is lack of leadership. The solution: assign a leader.<p>I had a class consisting of 4 projects, 4 people per group, and each project had a designated leader which rotated. These projects were so much easier to manage, because the leader had some <i>authority</i> given by the teacher. He therefore had the ability to delegate responsibility and people would actually do it. In normal groups, even if a leader emerges, they will often be ignored by less motivated students, because their authority is much more tenuous.<p>My point: it helps to have an assigned (and verified by the teacher) leader for a group project.",1256619627

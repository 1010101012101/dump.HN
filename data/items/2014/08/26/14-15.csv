Returns and expenses are a HUGE part of the law.<p>My favourite bit is what I call the &quot;anti-wardrobing provision&quot;. Under the new law, when you return an item, retailers can now deduct a fair percentage of its cash value from your refund if you have returned it clearly damaged or un-resellable. This is because of wardrobing - the practice of buying an item of clothing, deliberately keeping the tags on, wearing it once, and returning it for a refund stinking of your night out.",1409064393

Unlike in e.g. python, there was no nice gui library that I could just use.  Now maybe people will reply telling me that something exists, but compared to python, the difference in ecosystem is massive.  (possibly some commercial CL environment has this, but I am unwilling to pay for something that is closed).<p>I really want to use CL for more than just toy programs, but I don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t.<p>So, when you are asking yourself &quot;Is it worth it?

8227201,comment,8222982,8226949,2,0,virmundi,,,"First, I&#x27;ve never seen Marxism implemented in the real world. At the time of its writing, only the UK, Germany and perhaps Holland fit the required industrialization level. Attempting to implement it in an agrarian society was doomed from the being by the theory. Now I know that many (myself included) take issue with what we now call a  living wage, but so far it is the only humane response to dealing with poor people and their growing population due to industrialization. A living wage is essentially Marxism.<p>Think about the present situation. Technology is making more and more jobs unnecessary. Soon trucking will probably go the way of the buggy whip. That entire industry will shrink. Capitalist will own the trucks, and pay a select few to manage a fleet. The drivers and some of the mechanics are no longer needed to maintain routes. That&#x27;s a lost of many good jobs.<p>Now, not to disrespect every trucker, but many are average intelligence or below average. If jobs that survive technology require above average intelligence, the aforementioned truckers won&#x27;t have a job, even with retraining. Now what should we do with them? Pure capitalism would either have the poor die of starvation/exposure, private charities, poor jails or extermination. Private charities haven&#x27;t scaled in the past. Poor jails didn&#x27;t work either. I don&#x27;t see anyone killing the poor either. I also don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll get mass extinction in a modern society. Thus you&#x27;re pretty much left with a Marxist endgame. Eventually enough of the means of production is owned by the government, either directly or taxation on the producers, that you have a Marxist state.",1409063165

It might be <i>a</i> reason but it&#x27;s not the only reason, and certainly not the primary reason.<p>At the moment Burger King pays tax at a rate of 35% or thereabouts, on <i>all</i> of its income, no matter where it is generated. About half of its income is from the US, and half is overseas.<p>After the acquisition, it will still pay 35% tax on all of its income generated in the US, however it will only pay the local tax rate on its income generated outside the US. For example, this is about 15% in Canada, and 21% in the UK (there aren&#x27;t many countries where corporation tax is above 35%... Japan comes to mind).<p>So the saving is the difference between the local corporation tax and the US corporation tax, on about half of BK&#x27;s income - if the average worldwide corporation tax is 20%, so the difference is 15% and half that is 7.5%.

(Emphasis carefully chosen.) Java arguably has some solutions though I&#x27;ve not yet taken a close look at Akka performance. Erlang doesn&#x27;t have near-C performance. Haskell can only get near-C performance with a lot of work and care. (They&#x27;re still working on it, but it&#x27;s still non-trivial.) The scripting languages are laughably far away from near-C performance and you take such a performance hit that it doesn&#x27;t matter how easy they make multiprocessing after that.<p>I&#x27;ve still used Erlang for things that are truly IO bound. It&#x27;s great for that and a very solid VM. But don&#x27;t fool yourself into thinking Erlang is a performance solution for anything else.

If you look at that statement with C eyes, that probably sounds insane, but if you look at it from a modern type system perspective, it sounds eminently sensible and if anything not paranoid enough (where&#x27;s your <i>upper</i> bound?).<p>Unfortunately it&#x27;s too darned easy to casually subtract something and bam, Big Numbers due to underflow. What I <i>want</i> is to be <i>told</i> I have bug... what I get is just the bug.<p>I&#x27;ve also encountered it in some network code where the numbers in question were bitpacked. I mean, sure, it&#x27;s my bug, but philosophically I no longer think that&#x27;s the end of the story. Anything a compiler or runtime can do to help me avoid bugs, it should, and noticing a truncation is definitely in that class. Again, that statement may sound crazy in a C world, but it&#x27;s perfectly sensible in a modern one.<p>You don&#x27;t get truncation bugs because you&#x27;re so used to not getting any help that you just do bad things like not correctly specify your type, because you&#x27;ve thoroughly internalized how bad and wrong the compiler and runtime are here. You shouldn&#x27;t have to lie about your types to make your code work.",1409061622

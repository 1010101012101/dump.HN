I can&#x27;t say I really enjoy using taxis in Paris (although I don&#x27;t have any nightmare stories like other people in this thread, mostly minor annoyances like refusing to take credit cards and some general rudeness).<p>On the other hand having services like uber breaking regulations might end up making taxis less safe and with a worse quality of service down the line as prices keep plunging due to the heavy unregulated competition.<p>I think the right move would be to open the market while still heavily regulating them but I don&#x27;t know how the government can convince the taxi drivers to accept that since it would mean losing their super expensive license. I suppose the government could buy the licenses itself but that would be heinously expensive (and as a tax payer I can&#x27;t say I would really like that).<p>I really wish the government wouldn&#x27;t have allowed for this license market to exist in the first place, it was obviously going to create a cartel.",1435233449

9777200,comment,9775909,9775909,0,0,cjslep,,,"I enjoy watching various anime but am by no means into Japanese culture, nor the American culture that is into Japanese culture. However, when I was first introduced to anime by a friend (minus Spirited Away) which was Naruto, I was introduced to the English-subbed versions even though English dubs were available. After watching a few episodes of listening to Japanese and reading the subs, I thought it would be a good idea to skip the effort of reading and watch the English dubbed version instead.<p>That was a horrible experience. The English dubbed voices seemed to lack passion or say things in the wrong tones (or just be monotone!). Blue Gender immediately comes to mind as another painful English dub experience.<p>So, that is how my teenage self wound up pirating a lot of anime: because the fansubbing was extremely good and I could pick up on Japanese vocal intonation. I could actually tell what was a joke, and what was anger, instead of wondering when someone would have feelings at all in their English monotone!<p>In the case of Ergo Proxy, the additional notes in the fansubbing really helped understand the bigger dialogue. Without it I probably would not have held that particular show in has high of a regard.<p>The only consistent exception to the poor English dubs has been Miyazaki.

Having your code hosted here will increase lock-in which is the best way for the IaaS provider to increase margins in the future. However, code hosting is not the essence of that GitHub, BitBucket and we at GitLab offer. The essence is code collaboration: mentioning people, doing a code review, activity streams, etc. Getting this right is hard and I wonder if many IaaS providers will get this right.<p>The code delivery pipeline consists of issues, IDE, code hosting, CI, code review, configuration management, Continuous Delivery (CD) and a PaaS service. Code hosting is a first step and getting all the rest right is a lot of work. Services working on getting the IDE right are Koding, Nitrous.io, Cloud9, CodeAnywhere, Codio and CodeEnvy. And I suspect that GitHub Atom is running in a web-browser so they can effortlessly offer it online in the future. For configuration management you want to integrate with Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Salt and Docker.<p>At GitLab we offer CI and CD via GitLab CI. We hope for a multi-cloud future where organizations will deploy to different cloud providers. They will use PaaS software that spans the different IaaS providers.

9777123,comment,9775467,9775467,0,0,gjm11,,,"A few remarks on this stuff.<p>1. Very closely related is the pure-mathematical technique of <i>generating functions</i>, where you take a sequence (let&#x27;s say the Fibonacci sequence 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,...) and use its elements as coefficients in a power series (0+1x+1x^2+2x^3+3x^4+5x^5+8x^6+13x^7+...) and then notice that (e.g.) shifting the sequence by 1 is the same as multiplying by x, so if F is the series for (f(n)) then x.F is the series for (f(n-1)) and x^2.F is the series for (f(n-2)) apart from some corrections for very small n, which gets you F=(x+x^2)F+x or F = x/(1-x-x^2), and now you can factorize that quadratic and write F in the form p/(1-ax)+q/(1-bx) which immediately gets you an explicit formula for the Fibonacci numbers (the one with all the sqrt(5)s in it).<p>So let&#x27;s translate this into algebraic data types. We get<p><pre><code>  F(x) = x + x F(x) + x^2 F(x)
  data FibTree a = Leaf a | Pair a (FibTree a) | Triple a a (FibTree a)
</code></pre>
and the number of FibTrees with n &quot;a&quot;s in is exactly the nth Fibonacci number.<p>(There is a theoretically important data structure called a <i>Fibonacci heap</i>, but I don&#x27;t believe there is any connection between these and these &quot;Fibonacci trees&quot; other than that in both cases there is something you can count with Fibonacci numbers.)<p>2. Suppose you consider a rather boring binary-tree type like this:<p><pre><code>  data Tree = Leaf | Pair Tree Tree
</code></pre>
whose corresponding identity is T = 1+T^2, or T^2-T+1=0. If you&#x27;re a mathematician you will quickly see that the solutions (in the complex numbers!) of this are sixth roots of unity; that is, they have T^6=1. This clearly can&#x27;t hold in terms of types (it would mean an equivalence between 6-tuples of trees and objects of the &quot;unit type&quot;, there being only one such object), but it turns out that T^7=T is &quot;true&quot;; you can find an explicit construction for it on page 3 of <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9405205"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9405205</a> if you like.<p>3. It doesn&#x27;t appear that the author of the OP ever got round to writing about negative and fractional types, but other people have. For instance, this paper <a href=""http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~sabry/papers/rational.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~sabry/papers/rational.pdf</a> which I have only glanced at (it appears to do this in a more restrictive context where there aren&#x27;t general ADTs with recursive definitions; negative types seem to involve running computations backwards somehow, and reciprocals are &quot;constraints&quot;).<p>Apologies if I&#x27;ve got my Haskell syntax wrong anywhere.",1435231653

One newspaper wrote a &quot;review&quot; of sorts of Pittsburgh Yellow Cab and found that, for the most part, they wouldn&#x27;t take you anywhere put the airport. The author would call them, ask for a ride to the airport, get a cab at his door <i>immediately</i>, then change his destination once he got in the car. They made him get out of the car every time.<p>Everyone I know who lived here before Uber/Lyft has a story about going out to the bars, calling a taxi, waiting two hours for it to come, and ending up walking two more hours home because the taxi never arrived. And I&#x27;m sure many more people have had the same experience and simple chosen to drive drunk. It&#x27;s quite literally a publicly safety issue. Luckily Uber and Lyft came along two years ago and are now operating legally.<p>The #1 thing we&#x27;ve all learned from this debacle is that many, many cab companies are the scum of the earth. To be fair, though, some are still good. In Chicago, for example, you can hail a cab without even trying. You can go to the bathroom and find a cab waiting for you in the toilet. They are <i>everywhere</i>, they are reasonably priced, and they know the city a hell of a lot better than most Uber drivers. They continue to thrive because they are full time professionals who provide a better service than Uber and Lyft. That&#x27;s a lesson the drivers in Paris and Pittsburgh need to learn.",1435231506

Managed by Q’s workers get an “above market” wage, plus full medical benefits. “They are the same benefits that our programmers and engineers get,” Mr. Rahmanian said, because “we didn’t want to create a company that had a divide between people that worked in headquarters and the others.”<p>That&#x27;s just common sense. If you pay the same salary that some outsourcer pays you&#x27;re looking at a high turnover that will be  more of a headache and cost factor than 3-4k extra a year above the average wage for someone in customer support for example (which is a tiny amount compared to engineer salaries anyway).<p>>Munchery, a dinner delivery service, pays drivers a base wage that exceeds the minimum wage, plus their driving expenses, plus tips. Taken together, it comes out to about $23 an hour in San Francisco, far higher than most other delivery jobs. Those who work more than 30 hours a week also get health and retirement benefits.<p>I don&#x27;t know about Munchery and will give them the benefit of a doubt, but usually companies that offer full benefits for 30+ hours (don&#x27;t they legally have to do this anyway in SF?), they just cut anyone off at 29 hours.<p>Also the &quot;taken together&quot; &quot;wage&quot; is highly misleading if it includes costs of gas and all the other expenses that one has to pay for a car, in a city where one doesn&#x27;t even necessarily have to own one.<p>Basically the whole story is about common sense, as min wage or slightly above contractors obviously don&#x27;t tend to be very loyal or excited about their work beyond lip service, as pretty much anyone doesn&#x27;t see this as a long term situation and will just switch to the next best thing whenever possible.<p>Employment contracts on the other hand come with notice periods, non compete etc. that will make switching jobs a lot more of a hassle and make anyone think twice if they really want to do it.",1435231099

I was talking about the UI (I think that&#x27;s a rather pretty client, comparable to the current WhatsApp/Telegram/whatever thing).<p>Again, comparing to Telegram [1] (see disclaimer in my previous post: I use that as well):<p>* Jabber/XMPP is a weird point. You wouldn&#x27;t need Conversations if you wouldn&#x27;t have a server to use. You pick up Conversations because a) some friend tells you to install it and connect it to their server or b) you have a server of your own. If you don&#x27;t know what XMPP is, then yes - this client is not for you.<p>* Really? Can you look at the Telegram screenshots? Let me bite this time:<p>Hey Lucy, got a second?<p>As in the duration of 551557906200 periods of the radiation corresponding between the two superfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atoms? Yes, I might.<p>We need some data extracted from a secret chat…<p>* It&#x27;s free. [2, GPL] I know, Joe User isn&#x27;t going to build it, but again: You need a server for this to work. If you care about that, I&#x27;d say you have ways to save the 2.38 EUR if necessary.<p>The rest of your points are certainly valid (marketing for XMPP sucks), but again entirely different problems. I highly doubt that most people read the description of the Telegram or WhatsApp apps. Friends recommend it, people install it, use it, done. XMPP is a different case, because it requires a friendly server (and the post installation configuration step where you select one), but that&#x27;s not quite relevant for the &#x27;looks like something from the 21st century&#x27; discussion, is it?<p>I was trying to make the point that there are ~new~ and current clients for XMPP as well, even if Pidgin looks like shit.<p>1: <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.m...</a><p>2: <a href=""https://github.com/siacs/Conversations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/siacs/Conversations</a>",1435230221

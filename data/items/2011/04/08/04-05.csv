2422510,comment,2422343,2422385,11,0,pstack,,,"I enjoy watching other people's startups, but have never applied at YC, because I assume I am outside of their accepted demographic. I'm in my early thirties. I'm a solo-entrepreneur (I would <i>love</i> to have a partner, but I don't know a single person with the interest and ambition to be part of anything - they just want to work until 5pm to pay the mortgage and then go home) and, mostly, because none of my ideas have ever demanded enormous quantities of funding to get off the ground. Spending $10k or $20k on an unsure thing would ding me, but I'm fortunate enough that I'm in a career where I could cut a check for that amount if I had enough faith in my own project <i>and</i> enough necessity for the funding.<p>Also, I appreciate what YC does and offers, but my personal philosophy is that a lot of ideas which seek out funding don't need it.<p>I started a transaction (user to user) based service in 1998 and my only expense was $10/mo for hosting. When I needed more resources, I moved it to a community shared server at a colo for $20/mo. And by its fourth year, I was paying $100/mo for a 1U rack rental at May West in SF with a dedicated pipe. The cost never went higher than that. The only additional expense was around that same time when I custom-built a 1U heavy duty server (running primarily qmail, apache, postgres) with hot-swapping and redundant PSUs and storage. That was a one-time $5,000 expense that lasted the rest of the project's life.<p>With no more cash investment than the above, I grew it over twelve years to more than 100,000 members and millions of transactions. It even had its own annual (or so) user-arranged gathering. People formed their own businesses through the service. I learned of many life-long friendships people made on it. I've even received thanks from people who were able to support themselves through tough times and -- some -- even put themselves through school.<p>And it was all funded out of my pocket. The real investment was my time (as the sole designer, developer, customer service person, marketer, etc -- I did everything from write the underlying engine to designing the interface, to mediating customer problems). So much so that, eventually, I had to quit last year, so I could have free time again to keep up with my <i>actual</i> career. And try to maybe have a life. And focus on my health, which deteriorated over a dozen years of 60-80hr work weeks plus 40-60hr weeks on this service.<p>I learned a lot from the experience. Mostly, I learned what not to do. Things I would advise others to be aware of. One of the primary things I learned, however, was that you can do a lot more with a lot less than people might think. That doesn't apply to everyone who might apply here, of course. But it applies to anything I have ever bounced around in my head. And I'm kind of stuck with this ""if I can't do it on my own and make it support itself, then it's probably not worth my doing"" mentality. I suppose that if I didn't have the technical knowledge, I'd have a different view since even the basic work would necessitate involving paying someone just to get things off the ground.<p>By the way, if I were to start this project in 2011, instead of 1998? It would probably cost far less and I would have had far fewer scalability problems (I never did any advertising, but as soon as people started hearing about the service, it quickly exploded and fell over a few times while I tried to keep up). Specifically, I would forgo the expensive hardware investment four years into the project and I would forgo the monthly shared servers and other standard hosting. I would go straight to a scalable cloud service (Amazon, Rackspace, etc).<p>Anyway, that's my far-too-long version of why I've never submitted anything to Y and why I probably won't at any time in the future -- but I'll always dig watching them help other guys with great ideas pursue things. With great envy at their successes, of course! :)<p>Edit: I completely spaced on the whole ""value of advice/community/exerience"" aspect of what YC offers, which of course is of great value itself. My comments above are related to the <i>financing</i> only.",1302238613

So now that B&N is opening up the Nook Color with an SDK I'm a little more excited about it. But what I'm really curious about is, does B&N make a profit off the hardware sales or is it a loss leader for ebook sales (is it the razor or the blade)? If B&N makes money on the hardware it will have a nice new revenue stream as ebooks gradually supplant traditional print books, but if they take a loss on each unit hoping to recoup via ebook sales the platform may not have a long lifespan if they discontinue it due to everybody rooting the thing for a cheap Honeycomb tablet with no more vendor lock in.",1302237777

2422478,comment,2421943,2422198,7,0,actf,,,"I've never really understood the Windows/Mac analogy here. I think the main reason many people end up using Windows over OSX, or any other OS, has always been the availability of software. People use Windows because there is a lot of really good software that just isn't available on other platforms. Granted this is slowly becoming less of an issue now that OSX is gaining some ground, but it is still an issue for a lot of people.<p>If you compare iOS to Android, I think you see the same pattern. One of the reasons the iPhone is so popular is because of the apps, many of which just aren't available on Android. Even when an app is available for Android it often feels like a second class citizen, or an after thought - just as it often does on the Mac.<p>When I look at the mobile world in this light it seems like we should be comparing iOS to Windows and Android to OSX, but then again maybe I'm just reading into the analogy too much.",1302237510

It works decently for soft constraints, like springs, but if you want to rigidly enforce a constraint, you need very large forces which are applied very suddenly, and to integrate such a system you need a very small time step. My impression was that it was much better to design your constraints into the equations of motion such that you reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the system and solve directly for the ""constrained"" motion. But that was research papers. Do real game engines use the method described here? Maybe the difference is the degree of ""realism"" required.",1302236695

The interface builder and the simulator are quite polished and greatly reduce the effort in tweaking the UI.<p>However, with ADT, I spend most of my time struggling with XML layout files, and heap dumps attempting to improve the application. The interface builder became usable only with the latest version of ADT, and even-so, I often find myself dropping down into the XML often. The simulator takes a long time to load and is quite sluggish. I find it far more convenient to have the application run on the device each time. However, this implies that code-compile-run cycle takes more time on ADT than on XCode.<p>In conclusion, the iOS development tools help me in finishing the application quicker, leaving me enough time (and providing me better tools) to polish the interface further.",1302236473

My belief is that one major, current reason why iOS apps are of higher quality is not just because iOS users expect higher quality apps, but <i>also</i> because iOS users generate more total revenue for companies, providing a better ROI. If/when that shifts in favor of Android, those apps may become the higher quality versions.<p>As for what happens in the future, it's anyone's guess. Heck, it's entirely possible for Android to crush iOS in terms of market share but to still generate less total revenue for companies if no Android users actually install 3rd party apps.

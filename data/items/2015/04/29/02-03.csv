For you it&#x27;s just being happy by being with friends and family etc while for others its accomplishing something they truly believe in whether it&#x27;s some college kid trying to make the next chat app or Elon Musk trying to make humanity an interplanetary specie. That sense of fulfillment is attained from different things - and that&#x27;s ok. Everyone has their things that make them feel fulfilled, and they are not always the same.

9456251,comment,9454440,9455106,0,0,CydeWeys,,,"There are many jobs (though largely not office jobs) where you HAVE to be on time, where not being on time seriously throws a lot of scheduled things out of whack.  It is not unreasonable at all in these professions to expect someone to always be on time, and get rid of them and find someone more responsible if they cannot be.  One good example would be all of the elementary school teachers I&#x27;ve ever known; they NEED to be at work at their start time because that&#x27;s when they get a roomful of children handed over to them.  Being habitually tardy or unreliable in any way is completely unacceptable.<p>The friction here is probably from someone used to working in one of the job fields like this coming into an office environment where your hours aren&#x27;t as relevant as the quality and volume of your work.<p>I will say though, I was a lead developer at my last job and I had some issues with an employee (with two young kids) not putting in forty hours a week, and he wasn&#x27;t otherwise making up for it either.  He&#x27;d be the last one in and the first one out, and it was problematic because he was supposedly the senior developer on the team but he was not meriting his higher salary.  In the end I suppose you could say the real problem was with his output, not his hours, but they did seem like interrelated issues.",1430276082

I am not implying senators cannot read.<p>Senators do not generally have security backgrounds. So they turn to experts. The senators remain responsible for interpreting the expertise. They must consider all input within a wider context that includes other stakeholders.<p>When the senators discuss the legislation amongst each other, they consider the inputs of all stakeholders. They need to condense all they learned from the experts into legislation. This requires balancing the biases of conflicting expertise. How do the senators handle the inevitable situation where telecom experts pitch an argument that conflicts with that of Mr. Blaze?<p>The best marketed idea will win. Experts are salesmen and their ideas are their products.<p>All I&#x27;m saying is that when the experts pitch their ideas, the senators are vulnerable to the same uncontrollable subconscious factors as everyone else.

Here&#x27;s two:<p>One. The US thought that Bush was a fool when he claimed that the US needed to prepare for cyberwarfare. Because people scoffed at cyberwarfare (it&#x27;s not war, they said, making vague references to the absence of explosions) so the Bush Administration switched to trying to pry support from the public by waving around the goto boogieman - now it was cyberterrorists - Americans are afraid of terrorists right? This didn&#x27;t pass muster either. The image of hacker at that time was still of neckbearded manchildren renting their parents basements and people didn&#x27;t feel like computers could hurt them.<p>The Bush Administration pursued cyber capabilities anyway, now switching to the tactic of keeping the discussion out of the spotlight. This proved to be largely successful, as it tends to be. Without widespread coverage only a few fringe outlets and advocacy groups followed the legislation.<p>This, from my short time on Earth, describes my experience of US politics. The US is an international superpower and just as often as not its legislation is about what it needs to do internationally to remain top dog (case in point - TPP). But Americans, by part their own volition, part the determination of a Washington that thinks it knows better about this complicated subject (and may very well) and in part because of sheer magnitude and complexity; the public are not invited to vote on Foreign Policy except in the coarsest of ways. You want out of the Middle East? No president will do that unless the complicated set of international stategic circumstances happen to align with American ideals.<p>This brings me to the second point. That time is now. The US is trying to &#x27;rebalance&#x27; away from the Middle East. Not for high minded reasons mind you - and it will invariably maintain a presence. But now is an era where the US is undergoing fundamental transformation. It is shifting from its peacekeeping role in Europe and as a garunteur of energy security by interventionism and neocolonialism in the Middle East. It is moving to invest in the Asia-Pacific and to contain China from becoming a hegemonic power there (this is US grand strategy, both two decades ago by the Wolfowitz Doctrine and this decade by its reassurtion in the Bush Doctrine). New challenges face her: space and hypersonic delivery vehicles for nuclear warheads, air denial around the world by the proliferation of anti-air capabilities (sold by Russia, China), very effective propaganda campaigns on US citizens by foreign states fake blogs and newspapers, decrepit alliances and infrastructure, and having the softest underbelly in new sophisticated levels of cyberwarfare.<p>America&#x27;s cyberstrategy can only be understood in context of its broad strategy to both contain its competition beneath a level where physical warfare can break out and to prevent balances of powers and alliance systems that could similarly challenge her.<p>The problem for us is that an all-in in cyber is a canary. It means that diplomacy and other forms of coercion, influence and sabotage haven&#x27;t been enough to address the issue - and it foretells of conflict, at least for the meantime in the information domain.",1430274222

It&#x27;s worth noting that even in the days when third-party browsers would have been most compelling, usage was still tiny.<p>I don&#x27;t think the fact that firefox mobile is good quality really makes it that surprising that usage is low: people simply aren&#x27;t in the habit of customizing their devices in any real way, especially on mobile.",1448560769

So your option 2, if implemented by an airline, would make flying with them unacceptable for me.<p>Since one cannot change people - and I&#x27;d like to add to your list of problems with them a) checking every single row number because, just maybe, row 42 might come right after row 23, not 19 rows ahead b) stowing away luggage in the overhead compartments the wrong way, thereby maximizing required space and c) before sitting down on 3C, taking your time to stow away your luggage, then realize that something important is in there and retrieve it again etc.. all while, of course, standing in aisle, blocking passengers who try to get to row 4 to 47  - how about looking for technical solutions?<p>a) personal guidance system that one gets just before boarding: A small, cheap handheld device that is configured when the boarding pass is swiped that shows a simple arrow to guide you to your seat? It could even double as the key to unlock the entertainment system (and if not removable from there will not accidentally be taken off the plane after the flight).<p>b) high tech voodoo called &quot;paint&quot; - actually mark how much space one has per seat in the overhead compartments, maybe even with the seat number.<p>c) All airlines could adopt the concept of boarding groups, a lot of time could be saved as well. Last 5 rows first, then leave 5 empty, next 5 rows, repeat until at head of plane. Then fill the empty rows following the same schema. If currently boarding rows are displayed prominently at the gate, staff does not even have to deal with passengers who did not get the announcements and passengers don&#x27;t have to deal with unintelligible gibberish that qualifies as announcement (esp in 2nd or 3rd languages).",1448560102

10633963,comment,10626942,10626942,0,0,rrrx3,,,"My 2 cents, as a former visual designer, now senior UX designer - Dribbble is a place where lots of pretty baubles are on display, where flash is valued over process, and where it&#x27;s very hard to get a sense of anything other than the showcased designer&#x27;s visual acumen.<p>When I&#x27;m interviewing a designer, I don&#x27;t take it as a positive or negative that they have a dribbble account. If they&#x27;re interviewing for a position that is primarily visual design, I will peruse their stuff there just to get a sense of their style and capability, but not as a final deterministic factor on their hireability.<p>Dribbble was never really meant to be a place where people showcased their process, just a place where they could throw out a quick snippet to get reactions. Visual designers find that extremely helpful. If you&#x27;re not versed in the ideas of typography, color theory, moodboarding, concepting, or any of the other methodologies and tools in a visual designer&#x27;s wheelhouse, then looking from the outside in at Dribbble can make it seem like a world filled with trite, inefficient, fantastical non-reality.<p>You&#x27;re not alone in this. Even I, as a former visual designer, have to tell myself that when I go clicking through Dribbble. It&#x27;s not a place to showcase fully-polished, finished products - it&#x27;s not a product marketing site. It&#x27;s not a place to showcase the messy process of product design - it&#x27;s not a portfolio site. It&#x27;s a place where people can toss out ideas and get feedback on the micro-points of it. The colors, they typography, the alignment. Start to expect anything more and the model of the entire site falls apart.<p>For better or worse, Dribbble is not built to scale as a place for the critique of the entire design process. I think that&#x27;s where this article gets it wrong. There are plenty of things to critique the site for - the lack of real meaningful engagement, for example, or the highly exclusive invite-only nature, for another - but fundamentally the OPs of this article are projecting thoughts and ideas about what they think/want Dribble to be vs what it actually is.<p>TL; DR: Dribbble is a place to showcase digital visual art and design artifacts, not a meaningful UX or UI portfolio catalogue.",1448560009

They&#x27;re not sworn enemies. They don&#x27;t necessarily have to be alternatives; it&#x27;s reasonable to want both.<p>A couple of years ago I worked for DARPA project that was building a system designed for greatly enhanced security and reliability. It had a novel programming language designed to be able to express a rich set of reliability and security constraints in the type system. It had a rich static type system, but it also had a dynamic type system. Why? Because some important constraints simply can&#x27;t be analyzed statically.<p>For example, a program could say that it was impossible for a given piece of information to be delivered to an unauthorized receiver. That constraint cannot be analyzed statically because the authorization status of a given agent can change at any time. The type system had to be able to check authorization, so it had to have a dynamic checker (in fact, the system was designed to be able to do dynamic checks in hardware).<p>Maybe this sounds like an esoteric use-case, but is that because nobody wants to be able to express such constraints, or is it because we just don&#x27;t expect to be able to do so because we haven&#x27;t had the tools?<p>The project in question is in part meant to make the case that such use-cases should not be esoteric--that one of the reasons that our reliability and security situations are so embarrassing is that we haven&#x27;t so far taken those considerations seriously enough to develop the tools to deal with them. If we want to get better, maybe we should be thinking about how to integrate both static and dynamic type systems, rather than exalting one and denigrating the other.",1448559961

The lanes remove a significant percentage of road capacity.  They are also abused by single drivers, trucks, empty buses, etc.  It&#x27;s a complete joke.  The net result is to reduce road capacity and aid in creating congestion due to the constriction they create.<p>I see it every day across hundreds of miles of roadway cris-crossing Los Angeles.  I am willing to concede that there might be a magical place in the US where people wake up every morning and say &quot;what a beautiful day, I think I will carpool with my neighbor because we both work for the same company&quot;.<p>Not in Los Angeles.  That&#x27;s just not the nature of this city.  This isn&#x27;t a &quot;factory town&quot; where there are three destinations for the bulk of the population and carpooling makes sense.  If I go down my block the distribution of destinations is probably as random as you can get.  And these destinations are random in vector form.  In other words, direction and distance.  Carpooling is actually impossible.<p>And then there&#x27;s the question of infrastructure and schedules.<p>Also, people are too spread out.<p>There&#x27;s on person I know I could consider carpooling with.  Here&#x27;s the issue:  I would have to drive 15 miles out of my way every day to go pick him up.  He would have to drive 30 miles out of his way to pick me up.  Meet in the middle?  No can do.  There is no infrastructure to support that.  You&#x27;d have to leave a car at some random parking lot illegally in order to do this.  And this isn&#x27;t a solution that scales.  Oh yes, our schedules are very different, which means that 95% of the time we couldn&#x27;t carpool even if we wanted to.<p>People have kids, family, responsibilities.  Who wants to get a call from school to go pick up their kid who just threw up, be 50 miles away and not be able to respond because they carpooled with four other people.<p>The whole thing is one big joke perpetrated on us by stupid politicians.

But most people who commit crimes, don&#x27;t.  They&#x27;re experiencing brief or not-so-brief lapses in their planning capability, and they&#x27;re not looking more than five minutes into the future;  Extra sentencing is useless as a deterrent to these people, because they&#x27;re resistant to any consideration of sentencing.  They&#x27;re just not looking that far ahead.  Organized crime is the exception to this rule.<p>Notably, they&#x27;re <i>not</i> immune to the effects of a high arrest rate.  If someone has a 90% chance of 1 year in jail, it is an <i>inordinately</i> more powerful deterrent than a 10% chance of 10 years in jail.<p><i>The cost being the cost to incarcerate the person, and the benefit being the person&#x27;s inability to commit a similar crime for X number of years. So for really bad crimes that carry a really long sentence, the benefit to society of there not being a potential recurrence of the criminal&#x27;s acts outweighs the cost of the incarceration.</i><p>This is a different consideration.  This is &quot;incapacitation&quot; rather than &quot;deterrence&quot;.  It&#x27;s explicitly giving up on the ability of a prisoner to make decisions, either before the crime or after the sentence;  A criminal is thus destined to commit crimes, and &#x27;taking them off the street&#x27; is the goal.  That&#x27;s basically how we&#x27;ve approached this for the last ~40 years of progressively expanding incarceration rates, unlike most of the other countries around the world.  And that&#x27;s a fairly inhumane, morally questionable view to take, not least the end of the racial persecution of minorities for being minorities dovetails precisely with the racial persecution of minorities for being criminal in some way, living in a place with high criminality or being tangentially involved in the drug war.  Broken windows policing, where crimes may be invented, or activities criminalized, in order to get &quot;at-risk&quot; individuals into the system, where they are never permitted to fully leave.<p>We talk about lynching as some sort of widespread historical horror, but it only happened to 5000 or so individuals.  There are over a million black men in prison, and a lot more than 5000 dead as a result of things like the drug war and racialized pushes for ever-expanding sentencing.<p>Why do I bring race into it?  Because repeated waves of contentious race relations are the big sociological delta between our country, and most of the rest of the developed world.  And overt or not, it&#x27;s been central to how we&#x27;ve done any number of things differently, from the suburbs to the prisons to welfare to the healthcare system to our present political dysfunction.",1448558875

Plants and animals are basically engines storing and converting the sun&#x27;s energy into nutrients and natural ecosystems are very much sustainable. Add fossil fuels in the equation, like what the industrial age did and you get the current clusterfuck. Our grandparents seemed to have no problem in raising their own livestock with sustainable practices. Surely we can do better than them, since we live in the information age and all that.<p>And for people worried about efficiency, cost and over-population, we are wasting about one third of the food we produce right now. And we spend much less of our income and time on acquiring food. There is room for taking a step back in terms of throughput and maybe focus on quality rather than quantity. Which might be a good idea given that even though the calories in our food is at an all times high, for the first time in history we&#x27;re seeing overweight children suffering from malnutrition.<p>The real problem I&#x27;m having with your argument, as it&#x27;s what vegans usually say, is that if you want cheap, you can&#x27;t beat a combination of corn and soy grown through an industrial process, as these are the most efficient farmed plants we have.

No need to have what makes an architecture: a vision towards the future allowing different hardware generations to share hardware and software; a design allowing today&#x27;s software to be able to run on tomorrow&#x27;s hardware as long as the changes are not too drastic; consistency in choices of busses, key chips, address maps; a real firmware, not something utterly disgusting as EFI which can&#x27;t even compete with > 20 years old Open Firmware (IEEE 1275); and reliably enumerable busses. No, sir, we&#x27;ll take today&#x27;s latest SoC, wire a few extra devices wherever we can find some hole in the address map, put a castrated u-boot on it, and today&#x27;s stable Linux tree, and here you go, here&#x27;s your ``platform&#x27;&#x27;. And people cheer.<p>This issue at hand is that a minority of oss developers sometimes fight very hard to keep a long-term architectural vision maintained.

Eventually the long-term minority gets frustrated by being eternally overwhelmed and resigns. This is such a case.<p>So, questions seem to be:  Is this really inevitable or can something realistically be done to improve the situation?

They keep traffic flowing smoothly, even if it is slightly below the speed limit.<p>No, they don&#x27;t.  They create pile-ups behind them when driving unreasonably slow.  I see it every day.  Dozens of cars stuck behind slow drivers and huge empty gaps of road in front of them.<p>The only way they would keep traffic flowing smoothly is if they did not drive slower than the surrounding traffic.<p>> The ones who create the problem are those changing lanes to gain 5 mph and get to their destination one minute sooner.<p>I think you might be ascribing causation where it doesn&#x27;t exist.  Most of the cars I see zig-zagging through traffic (which is futile given the problems I highlighted) do so because of the aforementioned slow drivers who unreasonably plug-up the road.  People get impatient and the zig-zag game starts.<p>I see this effect every day.  Leaving the valley the road slopes up.  You are climbing.  Early in the morning traffic is relatively light.  People are moving at, say 75 mph.  And then it happens.  A few cars have drivers who, for some reason, do not maintain speed while climbing, they slow down to 65, even 60 going up the hill.  The cars are perfectly capable of maintaining speed, it&#x27;s the driver who does not.<p>When this takes place the effect is nearly instantaneous.  Cars pile-up behind the slow-climbing cars and a few of them start zig-zagging to get around them.  It&#x27;s a mess.  And with more traffic it launches a wave that ripples backwards and starts what eventually becomes a big problem as more people pile onto the highway.<p>The cause in this case isn&#x27;t people who want to drive too fast, the root cause is drivers who do not maintain speed during a climb.<p>> If people would just pick a lane and a speed and stick to it the overall throughput of the road would be much improved.<p>I completely agree with one modification:  Speeds need to be layered.  There are people who want to drive unusually slow.  There are trucks and buses that drive at 50 mph.  They should not be allowed to get over to the left, pick that lane and stick to it.<p>That&#x27;s the problem I am referring to.  We don&#x27;t have any rules that prevent someone doing 60 mph from inserting themselves into traffic flowing nicely at 70 or 75.  They come into that flow and it&#x27;s like a rock in an otherwise laminar flow stream, they create turbulence.<p>It&#x27;s not about going fast, it&#x27;s about extracting better efficiency out of the road.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with folks who want to driver slower.  Good for them.  Just get out of the way and let the rest of the traffic flow nicely.",1448558362

If someone is killed in a SWAT raid (swatting or otherwise) it&#x27;s almost always written off as a police officer &quot;justifiably fearing for their life&quot;. The officer that shot a sleeping 7 year old girl? Not murder (tried for manslaughter twice, two for two mistrials and then prosecutors dropped it). The officer that threw a flash-bang in a 1 year old boy&#x27;s crib? Not attempted murder, no charges at all.<p>But to be less negative about it, the vast majority of swatting don&#x27;t result in accidental police killings, probably for a variety of reasons including the higher concentration of well-trained, veteran officers as SWAT team members than in the police population at large, and the fact that the SWAT team almost certainly outnumbers their targets and all the cognitive effects that can have on the participants.",1448557643

I unplugged my cable a long time ago, and I stopped visiting most news websites even longer ago. If it weren&#x27;t for shares on facebook, I&#x27;d never find out about what scandalous thing a politician said to get in the media&#x27;s eye again. If I could filter facebook to only have text and photo shares from friends, I&#x27;d be so much happier with the site.<p>It&#x27;s interesting what you say about what&#x27;s going on in his head. Before I graduated school or worked in software, I had a pretty interesting repeating summer job as a QA technician in the nuclear industry. I did a great job and got along great with my boss and coworkers, and often we&#x27;d get together over holidays and special occasions. He was an older guy nearing early retirement. On one such get-together, the boss revealed his real opinion about &quot;who caused all this crap shit we&#x27;re in&quot;, being &quot;niggers and spics&quot;. Ugh. I was shocked that I was working for a racist, but what shocked me more was just hearing that, period. I couldn&#x27;t imagine holding an opinion like that at all, let alone having it my entire adult life and believing it worthwhile to share.<p>I have a hard time believing that most politicians are as dumb as the words they say to get on the air, and Trump is a master at constantly being on the air. But, at this point, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised by it.",1448557496

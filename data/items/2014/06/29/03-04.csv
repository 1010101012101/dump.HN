Click here to install SpywareInstallerActiveX&quot;. Many if not most users clicked OK. Similarly, all the big name apps and games ask for a huge long list of permissions and users are trained to just click OK.<p>iOS is better (though still imperfect). You want to see who I&#x27;m calling? Nope, the privacy invasion isn&#x27;t worth the risk of ever exposing that. Want access to contacts? Then the user will get prompted at that point in time, not at app install (though some crappy apps try to ask at startup). All apps are required to work even if the user says no, and be functional unless the permission is required for the app to work at all.<p>Users are much more likely to be aware of what is happening if the permission request happens at time of use. If I install a game then during the first level I get a popup asking for permission to access my contacts, I&#x27;m <i>much</i> more likely to treat that as a red flag because nothing about the context would indicate the app should be looking at my contacts, versus being buried in a huge list of permissions that I usually ignore anyway.",1404014206

(I&#x27;d forgive a physics major for being ignorant of these, but not not one who writes an article claiming to know something about CS.)<p>Even the fundamental design of operating systems hasn&#x27;t changed much in decades: Unix, which some of the most popular operating systems today (Linux, OS X, etc.) are based on, has been around since the 1970s (probably long before the author of this article was born). A process is still a process, virtual memory is still virtual memory, a device driver is still a device driver, and semaphores, which Dijkstra invented in the 1960s, are still used today.<p>Relational databases have also existed since the 1970s, and most of the computer languages we use today were invented before the turn of the century. So I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much danger in everything we know about CS today being useless in 20 years. (I got a CS degree over 30 years ago, so I have some perspective on this.)",1404013179

Our scripting system in particular is a massive upgrade from Avisynth&#x27;s bloated and ugly language.<p>Development has slowed a bit due to my involvement in a startup venture, but the only thing missing at this point is a decent standard library of filters. If anyone (esp. in the encoding community) is interested in helping out or taking over the project, please get in touch or open a pull request. We think this is a program that the encoding community would really benefit from.",1404011516

In particular, it is useful to keep in mind the way in which class and interface types structure their child types within a system of static typing.<p>This isn&#x27;t a bad thing. Being built on Java provides tremendous utility. But the way in which Java makes lumps under the Clojure language layer which blankets it gives Clojure a different flavor than say Common Lisp...and note I said &quot;different&quot; not better or worse.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s the idea I was trying to capture with the term. I wasn&#x27;t disparaging Clojure, just suggesting its relation to the JVM comes at the price against Haskell style greenfield implementation.",1404011274

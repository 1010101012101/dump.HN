8436036,comment,8427843,8428280,0,0,whichdan,,,"I would argue that recursion is very important. Could you elaborate on what makes it bad practice? Sure, in languages without tail-call optimization, using it instead of a loop will incur more overhead, but certain problems (like traversing directories in a filesystem, nodes in an XML document, or any tree structure) are impossible to implement otherwise. Do you have a specific scenario in mind where recursion was a poor solution to your problem?",1412909952

You could argue about semantics, but it&#x27;s clear at a very superficial level to everyone that he answered the question wrong - wrong forum, wrong wording - but that says nothing about how correct the answer is.<p>Like for a personal parallel, it would probably be wrong to announce to a friend that you thought they were ugly, no matter how correct you were.<p>The sincere apology would have been to announce that his answer was incorrect - otherwise he is just trying to pacify the mob, if that makes sense. Perhaps I&#x27;m being a little pedantic, but this email has clearly been proofread by a number of people, and the key statement is definitely not as clear-cut as this HN thread seems to be deciding (it&#x27;s a very clear-cut non-statement).<p>Edit: Criticism definitely fair, I jumped to conclusions.",1412909774

8435951,comment,8435852,8435852,0,0,Mizza,,,"HAWTHORNE, Calif. — Tesla Motors didn&#x27;t announce the self-driving car that some had expected but did roll out an exotic suite of driver-aid and safety features Thursday night.<p>And it said it&#x27;ll have a hopped-up version of its Model S that has all-wheel drive and blasts to 60 mph in little more than 3 seconds.<p>Tesla&#x27;s moves are closely watched by its shareholders, who seem to bid up stock prices wildly, then sell, so the Tesla shares rocket, then tumble, somewhat like technology stocks. And the electric-carmaker&#x27;s moves are considered a foretaste of what mainstream automakers might need to emulate to stay abreast of the latest technology.<p>Tesla announced Thursday that the all-wheel-drive versions of its Model S electric car will manage a slight increase in range of about 10 miles on a charge vs. the rear-drive models — for a maximum of 275 miles — because of efficiencies designed into the new system.<p>The AWD cars have a second electric motor to drive the front wheels. AWD hybrids, such as the Lexus RX, likewise use separate electric motors front and rear to accomplish all-wheel drive. That eliminates the need for a front-to-rear driveshaft and other cumbersome hardware.<p>CEO Elon Musk called his system &quot;a huge improvement&quot; that he claims is &quot;taking the technology to the next level.&quot;<p>The AWD cars will carry the designation D, and the new top version of the Model S, the AWD P85D, will be among the fastest-accelerating sedans ever: 0-60 mph in 3.2 seconds, according to Tesla. Five or six seconds is considered very quick.<p>The 85D models start being delivered to buyers in December. The other AWD models, 60D and 85D, arrive in buyers hands in February.<p>The addition of all-wheel drive will allow Tesla to compete more vigorously in the snowy East and Midwest, broadening is buyer base beyond the Sunbelt.<p>Jaguar made a similar move to AWD in 2013, figuring it was competing in a shrinking minority of the luxury market without AWD.<p>Tesla&#x27;s suite of safety features and driver aids is partly catch-up, partly leapfrog.<p>Brands from Mercedes-Benz and Infiniti to more mainstream nameplates such as Hyundai have features that will keep a car in its lane, steer it back if it begins to wander, stop without driver help if it&#x27;s racing too fast toward the car ahead.<p>But Tesla CEO Elon Musk says Tesla is adding innovations to those.<p>Two highlights:<p>•The new system will move the car over a lane when the driver uses the turn signal.<p>•The car reads speed-limit signs and adjusts the car to the speed on the sign.<p>Other features match the lane-departure warnings and other safety and driver-help features that are getting common.<p>Tesla says the cars it&#x27;s building now have 12 sensors each able to &quot;see&quot; 16 feet to enable the safety tech. Those can&#x27;t be retrofitted to older models, Tesla says.",1412908178

They finally added streaming voice recognition, which speeds it up a <i>lot</i> in my experience. Previously, it waited until you were done speaking to initiate the upload, which added a pretty big delay to any response.",1412906522

He spent a <i>lot</i> of time watching TV... there just weren&#x27;t a lot of options. We had a clapper set up that he could activate by making sounds with his tongue, and a stick he could hold in his mouth to manipulate the remote control, and also do things like make phone calls.<p>He was a smart guy and was really interested in all sorts of things, but he was sadly limited. Posts like yours remind me of him and make me wonder how he&#x27;d get on with modern technology. I do recall investigating speech recognition back in the day, I think it was an early version of Dragon, but the cost was just too high and the uses, with 80s-era computers and no internet or even nearby BBSs to connect to, were just too little. Anyway, thanks for sharing your experience.",1412906461

Larger institutions may even have Money Management and Entrepreneurship courses available, but they will usually be electives and are unlikely to be chosen by those of High School age (kudos to you if you chose them willingly). Taking this into account it becomes pretty clear why so many people are bad with finances: they were never taught it. If their guardians are bad with finances, or don&#x27;t put in any effort to teach them, in all likely-hood the students will fail to seek out this knowledge themselves until it starts biting them in the butt in the school of hard knocks.<p>I have been lucky enough to have a father that is a businessman, investor, and negotiator, and put in a lot of effort to teach me the dark arts. The difference that is created by having an active parent was very apparent in high school. Classmates who had taken courses similar to myself and I considered equals academically usually gave me confused looks when I talked about finances outside of theoretical economics.<p>#####<p>It&#x27;ll be great if you take on this project; people will benefit a lot from it. The important part, as oxalo said in another comment, will be execution. Sending it to editors of websites that those in that age group frequent, trying to get them to review it or recommend it would be a great way to start the fire. If it starts, leave it alone and it will likely grow by itself.<p>As far as revenue, think about what your true goal is. Unless you&#x27;re strapped for cash, you may not even need to generate revenue: hosting is cheap and small donations will be more than enough. Your time isn&#x27;t free of course, but that&#x27;s why suggested thinking about your true goal. It&#x27;s highly unlikely that you&#x27;ll spend more than a few hours here and there once it&#x27;s set up, since your focus is on the base content.<p>Besides, if thinking about how much it&#x27;ll help others isn&#x27;t good enough, consider it an investment. If it takes off, it&#x27;ll be a big item in your portfolio.<p>#####<p>I&#x27;ll throw in some suggestions:<p>* Definitely have a transcript for every video. Different people learn differently. I personally avoid videos since I can read faster than people can speak.<p>* Definitely do a section on negotiation.<p>* Start of with major points that give big impact. If they stop after that first video, at least they will have left with something useful.<p>* For negotiation I would recommend starting them with the dark art of anchoring: knowing how to use it can single-handedly make the difference between a salary of $25k and $65k. (I call it a dark art since it&#x27;s so effective, while also being a blatant abuse of human psychology).<p>* Some things will be difficult to teach electronically. The basic of the business world, how to give a handshake, will be one of those. You would be surprised how many people would not know how to react if you walked up to them offering a handshake.<p>#####<p>Feel free to contact me, I would be happy to be a part of this. You&#x27;ll be able to find my information in my profile page.",1412906413

Over a 24hr period this machine pays out 95 cents on the dollar. This gives the casino the ability to make a machine pay out $1.05 dollars to $1 early in the night, then change to worse odds as players become convinced its a hot machine.<p>So, one could argue the &#x27;hack&#x27; was no different than this. The probability of paying out was set to 500 to 1 for 1 hand. This is legal for the casino to do, but you turn the tables and a guy goes to jail?<p>Regardless, this is just more evidence that the &#x27;house always wins&#x27; (even when it looses).",1412708314

This is <i>Hacker</i> News after all.<p>Right now one team, Ycombinator, is trying to fix important issues in the ranking and moderation of posts and comments. Many of us are frustrated by the increasing domination of popularity (and hatred) over quality and relevance. A lot of good submissions and comments are simply buried, never to be found. There is too much muck to have to wade through. The timing of posts and comments plays a much larger role than quality.

If having vote data allows someone to game the front page, then only include it with some delay (2 days?) so that it could&#x27;t be used to game the front page. This will still allow experimentation with collaborative filtering algorithms and the like.<p>My take on the privacy issue is that anonymity isn’t that important for a site like Hacker News:<p>1. Startup culture is about straight talk, putting your money where your mouth is, and open critical feedback, both in the giving and receiving. There are precedents for exposing voting data (e.g. Quora, Facebook, Stack Exchange).<p>2. HN is not aimed at political discussions or other topics where anonymity can be paramount.<p>3.

Other lists apart from the top stories (new, show, ask, best, active etc.) don&#x27;t seem to be available at all right now.<p>Of course this is just the first version, and the documentation promises improvements over time – which I don&#x27;t doubt at all – but there&#x27;s no clear indication that the API will be at feature-parity with the current website, even excluding anything that requires authentication, by October 28. So this means that I – and other developers of client apps or unofficial APIs – will probably have to write new scraping code once the new rendering engine (which I assume refers to the website) arrives instead of being able to switch to the new API immediately.<p>Now I guess I might just be needlessly worried, especially since the blog post explicitly says that the new API &quot;should hopefully making switching your apps fairly painless&quot;, but then why not wait until it&#x27;s actually ready for that before making the announcement?

The following arrow swaps the outer two elements of a 3-tuple.</i><p>I can&#x27;t tell if this is intentional or not, but it&#x27;s a prime example of when programmers should Stop Writing Code and use a high-level flow diagramming tool, for the same reason that large projects shouldn&#x27;t be done in assembler, that chip designers long ago gave up doing layout by hand, and architects use drawings instead of writing out step-by-step instructions. Code is a really terrible medium for defining structural relationships.<p>Sticking with the architecture metaphor, if you look at the plan for a building it requires skill and effort to understand properly - and for large buildings, a capacity for understanding abstraction - but even to the untrained eye there&#x27;s a clear isomorphism between the plan and the actual structure. When you first encounter a large body of code it&#x27;s more like a jigsaw puzzle without the reference picture. There are some standard reference points you can rely on - analogous to identifying edge and corner tiles, and knowing about different conventions of interlocking tiles - but you have to do a good bit of reading before the flow of the program emerges and you get a sense of where most of the computational effort takes place. My mental representation of a program is as a causal network, somewhere between the operation of a clock and a Rube Goldberg machine (probably because I spent a lot of time dismantling clocks as a child); reading code in order to figure out the operational structure often feels to me like closing my eyes and trying to infer the structure of something through my hands.",1412706311

But I think for the vast majority of projects, I would prefer automatic reference counting with the occasional weak reference to break cycles, particularly if that were the default for the language. I can appreciate that being explicit about resource ownership is an advantage in situations where one needs to absolutely minimize performance overhead. But for most applications, I think a system of ownership and borrowing like Rust&#x27;s would just add extra cognitive load for the programmer for no appreciable gain. Of course, Rust isn&#x27;t a language for most applications AFAIK; it&#x27;s a systems language for performance-critical infrastructure like Servo. And Rust is probably not a language for blub programmers. But I think this blog post is absolutely right about the problems with GC plus a system for disposing of resources. It sucks that mainstream, blub-friendly language have mostly chosen GC over reference counting; I think automatic reference counting provides the right set of trade-offs for most applications.",1412706085

So I don&#x27;t think <i>zero</i> overhead is critical.<p>2) Cycles are pretty easy to avoid when you&#x27;re only refcounting Big Expensive Objects (FDs, mmapped buffers, etc. etc.) For a general runtime, refcounting is tricky.

Harris modified his testing unit to covertly reprogram the EPROMs on the machines he was auditing. His new software commanded the machine to trigger a jackpot upon a particular sequence of button presses—like a Konami Code for cash.<p>This is actually a really interesting story that I saw on one of those &quot;Vegas&#x27;s Biggest Criminals&quot; type shows.  This Ron guy was given the job and created a device that would plug into the slot machine and check for tampering.  He programmed it to check the device, mark it as clean, then insert his own code.  This code allowed him to instantly win jackpots.  He would have to bet a specific combination to open the jackpot.  For example he had to bet 1 credit, bet 3 credits, bet 4 credits, bet 1 credit etc.  I believe the sequence was like 50 steps long.  He would obviously have friends play the machine to win.<p>Benefits to this system was that his team could spread out among many machines.  If the casino wanted to check the machine, they would send Ron in and the machine would come up as clean (he developed the software to check it).  The sequence was so long that it would take someone a lot of work to recognize it, and no one was likely going to stumble upon it by accident.  It was really genius, however I can&#x27;t remember how he got caught.",1412705266

And then I repeated this many times knowing that there was an error in their system?<p>Now the bank if I had gotten away with it and could not be detected would then chalk it up as a loss and part of the calculated risk of having computerized banking.  However if they knew I did this on purpose and took their money should they chalk that up as a loss and allow me to get away with it?  No they would want that money back from me and possibly have me arrested for fraud.",1412704986

8422809,comment,8421656,8422397,0,0,dmayle,,,"Slot machines are programmed with a table of payouts based on a rate, typically between 80 and 99%, such that the statistical expected payout overtime will be compounded at that rate.  In some jurisdictions (e.g. Vegas), it is legal for the casinos to program a machine at greater than 100%.  They do this to attract the players, who will attempt to find the winning machine on the floor.  Random numbers still work, so not every payout wins, but over the course of the day you can get a payout.  So you may have just walked away from free cash.<p>Source: I used to work in casino gaming (I wrote the Megapot server used for multi-casino progressives in France)",1412704978

The problem for the urban areas is that ebola seems to persist (as long as its in a fluid) and its so infectious (small threshold exposure). The two may conspire to create an issue that 99.99% clean isn&#x27;t clean enough. Thus, discharged fluids even in small amounts may very well transmit the virus in trace amounts (again, in the linked piece).

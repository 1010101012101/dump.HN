Goto any speedtest site and somehow you're getting exactly 12MB down, 3MB up, but it never really seems to add up that way anywhere else.

Admittedly I am attacking my own impression of a book I don't own (and don't plan to). Technically I am beating up a strawman, which is always an uneven fight.<p>> How do you quantify this minimum amount of work is? The 4 hour body prescribes a methodology of continual trial and measurement. That is what the book is about.. applying this principle to your goals for your own body.<p>Thank you for the best point made yet. I think it's great to experiment on yourself. I keep a log for more or less this purpose. However, it is problematic to generalise from ""this worked awesomely for me"" to ""this will work awesomely for everyone <i>forever</i>"", because novice gains dry up fast.<p>> Starting Strength looks great. I started lifting about 15 years ago - my first read was Arnold's 'Encyclopedia of Body Building'. Either of those books would take me a few weeks to really absorb<p>Yeah, I had Arnold's book in high school. Spent hooooours in the gym doing every variation of shoulder exercise known to man. My only really fond memory of the book is that it insisted on squatting and by god I did lots of them. Squats have never let me down.<p>>  The Four hour body took me about 6 hours to read, it encouraged me to cut back my workouts from 6 hours per week to 3 hours per week - so far with solid results.<p>I am very pleased it is working for you. I note in passing that Starting Strength aims for 3 workouts of 45 minutes duration -- less time than you are spending now.<p>Edit: a good book to follow <i>Starting Strength</i> is <i>Practical Programming for Strength Training</i>, by Rippetoe et al.",1296704747

It's my fault. hanks a lot for pointing that out, I'll fix it.<p>As far as tweaking in production goes, its usually better to launch and iterate, than to sit and try to make it perfect before launch. The current version works well enough for most people to use it, and I'm sure that not many people really care if the logos or design on all pages aren't consistent (I'm not saying that its not important, just that its not critical enough to hold off on launching).<p>As far as being professional with the website is concerned. I only did the designs for a couple of pages in Photoshop. The folks at VideoLAN had to code it up themselves and also adapt the designs I gave to fit all other pages. That takes a lot of time and effort. Although I don't speak for VideoLAN, I am sure that they would rather focus on their software than the website.<p>That being said, I agree that they should work on making their website, and everything else about VideoLAN from start to finish, perfect, but it can only happen if more people volunteer.

Why did I do this excruciating experiment? Well, I wanted to show clients how I can make Excel look like a bullet proof application with output on top of sculptured, raised backgrounds… i.e. the look and feel of make-your-own Dashboards… Bottom line – I don’t think clients will pay for this expertise… You can make you own Excel Dash Boards 9 as I have done many times) without resorting to the extremes I recently undertook… 
…So having confessed my inexperience about the difficulty in making non- Excel calculators, I thank my luck stars that we have Excel… without out a doubt the most flexible and beautiful numerical authoring tool on the planet offset by the extreme difficulty in detecting algorithmic mistakes.

A few weeks ago I wrote a simple fuel saving device feasibility calculator. I whipped off the Excel version in a couple of hours…. Then, I tried to do all the calculations inside controls using VBA code, placing output in text boxes… OMG … this “simple” experiment turned into a long nightmare…  What we take for granted with Excel – i.e. dependent relationships being automatically programmed is NOT done in VBA… I had to place code in every dependent  control (SpinButtons) to calculate several text boxes and to carefully format them both numerically and graphically … like Green Boxes for Positive Numbers and Pink for Negative Numbers…  Now I should have call up a module and avoided duplication, bu nonetheless, this was a tough edit… Spinning numbers in and seeing if every text box that should have registered movement actually did…",1296702220

To underscore the other knowledgeable experts on this bog, finding the error before you replicate is very tough, indeed. It takes time, several sets of devoted eyes to methodically question each algorithm, which unfortunately are written in cells, which are hard to edit.  One thing I learned was to use spaces in a cells code… Spaces inside a huge concatenated IF Statement (the type I love to make), have no effect on calculation, but a huge effect on legibility and understanding… Remember, Excel 2007 allows something like 7,000 characters in a cell, so spaces can work… Use Alt Tab to move code to the next line… give yourself a clear line and line up the code so that similar code components are in columns… this really helps when you come back a year later and have no comments to remind you what you wrote… also if you use VBA – to calculate and fill in a cell, be sure you clean that code and leave some narratives as to what you are doing…",1296702205

I'm a financial model builder since Excel came out on the MAC in 1987 (I’m now however a PC and 63 years old www.fser.net). Some of the inaccuracies are caught using accounting articulation points: Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity... if out of balance, something is wrong... What is wrong is a bit tricky and takes thorough understanding of how Income Statements, Balance Sheets and Cash Flow Statements interact. 
Unfortunately, articulation points don't catch algorithmic mistakes. My models have some very complex algorithms built over the years and the best thing to do is graph each line “quickly”, looking for breaks or unusual patterns in each line item. My models are regularly 3,000 to 5,000 lines long - not because I like complexity, but because I have lots of ways of expressing revenues and expenses. I can model most business in a few hours.
Recently, I built a steady state feasibility model for growing, harvesting and extracting lipids from algae using heterotrophic and autotrophic systems. I did make a graphing tool that would allow me to capture the relationship between any input and output as I incremented an input 10 times. In most cases the output was basically linear as the model was basically a linear calculator… I would suggest any builder of engineering models to implement an incrimination graphical recording system as an error checker.",1296702168

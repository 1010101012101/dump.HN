They moved to JS because of two reasons, IIRC: to get a runtime for free (Node) and to be &quot;more familiar to more developers&quot;.<p>Besides syntax, Opa offers quite a lot of benefits on a language level. Static typing with inference and statically typed HTML - this means that code that isn&#x27;t safe in terms of HTML injections does not compile at all! Executing the same code on both backend and frontend, built-in database layer and a whole lot of helpers and tools for creating SPAs.<p>At first I thought Opa is something like Seaside in Smalltalk or Nagare in Python, but it is unique in that it lets you write client-side code without much hassle, which is rather hard in other frameworks.",1436614930

There are so many broken processes and barely functional tools that you don&#x27;t even have to look for opportunities: They&#x27;re literally everywhere.<p>I have quite a few product ideas - mainly about EHR systems and data fragmentation / data exchange. I&#x27;ve shared those ideas with friends in the healthcare industry (both physicians and people working for insurance companies). While they all agreed that this particular area is in desperate need of fixing and the product I suggested would help with alleviating  some of the pain they also said that for the principal stakeholders there&#x27;s little to no motivation to improve or modernize processes.<p>The industry is driven by very complex, intertwined, often political incentives and ulterior motives. The patients&#x27; actual well-being seems to be quite low on the priority list.<p>Physicians also often seem to be quite averse towards technology and often don&#x27;t trust people who aren&#x27;t doctors themselves (so getting a doctor onboard your healthcare startup team might be a good idea if you haven&#x27;t done so already ...). I know specialists who own ridiculously expensive CAT scanners, MRI scanners and whatnot yet still insist on sending the images created by these expensive machines via mail (the traditional one, not the electronic variety - with expectable results: Data occasionally gets lost, data is fragmented across various providers, scans have to be done again because the image from 3 months ago can&#x27;t be found anymore ...).<p>Sales is another problem. If you ever thought enterprise sales processes were long and complex those are eclipsed by enterprise sales processes in the healthcare industry. If you want to market a new product you have to navigate a Byzantine labyrinth of certification processes apparently carefully put in place by lobbying incumbents in order to keep upstarts out of the market. When marketing a new healthcare product targeted at healthcare providers you&#x27;re looking at years - not months - of painstaking and costly lobbying. I&#x27;m not sure how any startup could afford this.<p>I don&#x27;t want to sound negative. I&#x27;d love to see more improvements in this space but I&#x27;m afraid that - other than consumer products such as quantified self apps - the situation looks pretty bleak. If you have any suggestions as to how to address these issues and change the industry for the better, please drop me a note.",1436614875

But it seems to be from a perspective of totality which I&#x27;m wary of. Not saying you&#x27;re wrong, going to check out those links. Andrej Bauer was very kind to answer an out-of-the-blue email query of mine once :)<p>Seriously appreciative of your response, a thousand thanks!<p>EDIT: Ok, I&#x27;ve read your paper/slides. Very interesting. Don&#x27;t you show that for specific constructions you can make LEM work for classical proofs with continuation monads? How does that show that _in general_ in constructive mathematics that the implication (~p ∨ p) ⇒ (¬¬p ⇔ p) holds but not its inverse? Also, your bit about rewinding time makes complete sense imho because classical logic is atemporal and continuation monads inject the idea of flowing time into those proofs in a controlled manner.<p>EDIT 2: I _highly_ reccommend Dennis E. Hesseling&#x27;s <i>Gnomes in the Fog: The Reception of Brouwer&#x27;s Intuitionism in the 1920s</i> which I think gives a different slant on what Brouwer actually claimed than what you might imagine if you go with Andrej Bauer&#x27;s interpretation.

Compilers can be very smart and help you catch a lot of errors but they can also introduce friction if they become too slow. Everyone has different opinions about the &quot;best&quot; because we have different ways of getting to the end-result. Programming is a discovery process and some people prefer to think a lot upfront, some like to experiment and probably a different mix of both for every one of us.<p>All this to say that nil in Go is not an absolute mistake.

9869333,comment,9868017,9868017,0,0,todd8,,,"Having spent many years attending universities and now sending two kids to university I observer that colleges and universities realize that tuition costs are no longer a major factor in students choosing one university over another. Cost is no longer a factor in the competition between colleges; they compete on amenities.<p>The universities have new luxurious dorms, outdoor swimming pools that look like Vegas resort pools with lounge chairs for sunning, large new fitness centers with indoor tennis courts, elaborate climbing walls, yoga and spin classes, etc. The universities simply raise their tuition to cover these expensive facilities. It&#x27;s kind of like visiting one of the best health clubs you could imagine, except filled with beautiful people all your age and all looking for new relationships (or looking to hook up) and not having any parents around and having a free, really great cafeteria, and being told that being a member there for four, five, or even six years is going to be really fun (football games and parties, yay!) and finally being told that its not going to cost anything right now you can <i>just pay for it later</i>. During the sales pitch, you&#x27;re told how good for you it will be and how you will come out knowing how to think and being given examples of all the people that were members of this club in the past and went on to do great things.<p>The evolution of universities into playgrounds for young adults has also had an impact on the educational choices begin offered. For example, universities now support large fine arts programs where students can work for years on majors where most will have no hope of obtaining meaningful employment in the field once they graduate.<p>I&#x27;ve been to a large &quot;job fair&quot; kind of event, except for there being no jobs, given by a very large university&#x27;s college of Fine Arts--I went with a friend that was already a freelance musician at the professional symphony level who was going back to work on a graduate degree in oboe. The final, most memorable, talk was given by an alumnus of that college of Fine Arts which spoke about how one gets a job with a degree in music.  The speaker related how difficult it was living in a shitty apartment in New York while playing jazz in clubs and how he finally after a few years started making a reasonable living by switching from playing bass to web-design.  This was the best example the Fine Arts department presented of a &quot;successful&quot; graduate. By the way, my friend, the amazing oboe player, years later ended up selling her oboe in disgust and never played again.<p>All the schools are expensive now. With an exception of in-state schools, tuition at almost every university each of our kids considered was both high and practically the same across the board. Finally, although slightly off-topic, in my neighborhood children attend one of the very best public high schools in the country so the excellent and less expensive state university here is actually too hard to get into because admission there is based on class rank and doesn&#x27;t take into account how much harder it is to be in the top 7% at the local public high school vs almost every other public high school in the state. It&#x27;s possible to be admitted to Stanford but not make the 7% cutoff to get into the state University.",1436612830

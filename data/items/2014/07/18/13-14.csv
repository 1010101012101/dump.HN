I learned to build my own kernels which took hours on the crappy old dell I owned at the time, but very satisfying. It was even more exciting when I managed to get a Novell NE2000 clone to work with it as well and set up my first web and FTP server in my bedroom and then got it to talk to my Hayes compatible modem and Demon Internet.<p>Happy hacky days :)<p>I use CentOS these days, mainly because it&#x27;s our company standard, I must go back and give it another spin.

8052982,comment,8052589,8052780,9,0,yaantc,,,"I&#x27;m French, so this will definitely color my judgement.<p>I find English to be rather simple. The grammar is as simple as can get, and due to it being the international language people are very open to weird accent (including ze frrrrench wane ;). This makes it easy to start, even with a pretty rough command of the language. Then the main challenge (IMHO) to a good mastery is the large vocabulary, and the very irregular pronunciation. But nobody expects that from a foreigner starting in English, which is a benefit of it being the international tongue I guess (spoken by all, mastered by... less).<p>On the other hand the French grammar is very complex. That&#x27;s not specific to French, many languages are like this. Spanish and Italian are pretty close, and German is also complex (I tried the two first, but have no experience in the later). Still, it requires a significant upfront investment to get to a working level.\nThere is also a cultural challenge: the expectation in French is that you have to speak properly. For a foreigner there is some tolerance of course, but still the culture has a strong bias on speaking correctly, and for some professional contexts it will matter. There&#x27;s a lot of history there, but let&#x27;s say that command of language has long been a class differentiator. Nothing unique to French, I would guess it&#x27;s the same in British English for Great Britons. But in an &quot;international English&quot; context that&#x27;s definitely not the case, and it helps get started. \nAnother challenge is that words tend to be more overloaded in French (smaller vocabulary vs. English), which opens the door for a lot of double meaning. This exists in all language, but can be a challenge to a newcomer and is not as common in &quot;international English&quot;.<p>So all in all, I&#x27;d guess international English is easier than French. In any case seriously learning another language and its culture is highly recommended, whatever your choice. It&#x27;s really a mind opening experience, as any one will find that &quot;obvious&quot; things that everybody knows are actually just cultural conventions. So the more remote the culture, the bigger the gain on this account.<p>As for French dying, the number of speakers is actually increasing, mainly due Africa rising population and the large number of French speakers there.",1405691398

Or what will come of that language 500 years from now.<p>What matters is what experiences open up to you, as individual, when you go visit (and live) in those countries, in this life, right.  It&#x27;s the people you meet -- and become friends with, perhaps fall in love and start a family with -- and the literature, the music, and poetry that keeps reading and listening into the dead of night and into your dreams -- that matter.  Not the gender/case system, of the fact that can speak some generic version of it in 54 countries.<p>In that sense nearly every (major) language community is infinite, and unique.  Maybe the one that&#x27;s most meaningful for you will be a globally dominant language, like Spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic.  Or maybe it will something far more &quot;marginal&quot;, like Basque or Pashto.<p>But whichever it ends up being:  whether that language is &quot;alive&quot; or &quot;dead&quot; to you will be a direct function of the energy and enthusiasm you invest in learning it, and (correspondingly) your love for the people who speak it, and their culture.<p>And not a function of whether you can go to a Barnes and Noble right now and find a shelf with 50 (mostly) mediocre books and interactive learning tools for it.",1405691311

Looking at a different aspect of heritability, modernity did far more damage to the intake of celibate religious orders and celebration of virginity than aeons of selective removal from the gene pool of those especially vulnerable to the idea that chastity was a virtue.<p>Populations of people that think birth control is a good idea and are quite happy to defer their children until later in life still reproduce in sufficient numbers to remain the majority in developed countries, especially assuming that many offspring of reproductive fanatics will end up &quot;defecting&quot; and behaving according to the prevailing social norm rather than their parent&#x27;s preferences or inherited instincts.<p>Given the continued reproduction of people who think birth control is a sensible idea, women should have careers and more than three kids is a headache, I think heritability of desire to have large families would have to be almost deterministic for us to start to worry about hyper-fertile people taking over.",1405691207

In school -- over a decade ago -- I took six semesters of French courses, and I&#x27;ve done some immersive trips to Quebec (which admittedly is a different dialect, but at least helps a bit).<p>Last week I was in Paris. Even with a refresh on grammar and vocabulary, I struggled a <i>lot</i> to communicate in French.<p>The most difficult thing, for me, is the sentence structure. I have enough vocabulary and grammar to choose the words I want, but I have a lot of trouble putting them in the correct order. And this is not a rare thing; it shows up in all sorts of simple sentences.<p>For example, in English I might ask &quot;Where is (X)&quot; or &quot;Is this street (X)&quot;. In French, I need to flip those around to &quot;(X), where is it&quot; or &quot;Here, this is (X)?&quot; The sign to hang on the door of the hotel room would, in English, say &quot;Please do not disturb&quot; -- in French, it says &quot;Thanks of not to disturb&quot;.<p>All of those words are, of course, easily recognizable, but the structure is completely alien to an English speaker (especially the way French uses infinitives in so many situations where English does not, giving rise to stereotypes of French speakers attempting English and always saying &quot;Please to tell me...&quot; and such).<p>I suspect that it would take me many months or perhaps even years of immersion and full-time speaking and thinking in French to get to the point of being able to construct most sentences in &quot;natural French&quot; structure on the first try.",1405690548

Blech, I&#x27;d rather wear someone else&#x27;s underwear, no thanks, I&#x27;ll take the 12 credits but no way am I retaining anything.  &quot;Well, science says you lose the ability to learn languages as you get older.&quot;  Oh, did NPR just interview TED?   Dummies in other countries and dummies in the CIA learn as adults, are they all using different science?  An American describes another American who is fluent in French as &quot;oh my God, he&#x27;s so smart, he speaks French and everything&quot; but this statement is easily unmasked as a defense by getting him to describe a Frenchman who speaks English: &quot;well, they all speak English over there.&quot;  The bilingualism is robbed of the &quot;intelligence&quot; signification because it&#x27;s seen as customary.... who they are.  America is a branded-identity nation, which means hearing yourself speak in not-your accent, with not-your vocabulary sounds very not-you, which is why when an American tries to speak French he feels self-conscious, but the Frenchman hearing it feels you aren&#x27;t even trying.  He&#x27;d be wrong, you are trying: trying not to become French.</i><p><i>&quot;Ugh, I hate psychobabble, why can&#x27;t you be more like Malcolm Gladwell and give me  practical neuroscience based tips like &#x27;get up before dawn&#x27; or &#x27;play basketball annoyingly&#x27;?&quot;  Fine, here&#x27;s your concrete advice that you won&#x27;t take for shaving 6 months off your second language acquisition: master the accent first. Before even one word of vocabulary.  The accent will teach you the rhythm of the words and the grammar-- it will make it okay for you to learn the vocabulary.  And you will think differently.  American exceptiono-isolationism isn&#x27;t arrogance, it&#x27;s a cognitive bias impressed on us from kindergarten when we learn that there are only two languages in the world, English and Everything Else.  Which teaches us that a German is more similar to an Italian than a Texan to a New Yorker, and I can predict with 100% accuracy that if that made you pause you only speak English.  Can&#x27;t wait to hear your foreign policy ideas over drinks.  You should work for NPR.</i><p><i>Once you have the accent down, pick a foreign language actor or actress you admire, and learn the language as if you were them.  Talk like them.  This trick works because you are thinking like someone else, acting like someone else, yet simultaneously distancing yourself from this change-- I&#x27;m doing this, but it&#x27;s not me, I&#x27;m just pretending.  The self-consciousness is removed because it&#x27;s not &quot;you&quot; who is doing it.  Yet it is; and after a time, you&#x27;ll become it-- and the positive benefit for society is you&#x27;ll hate the guy you used to be.

To begin, English doesn&#x27;t give genders to every idea. English has much fewer irregular verbs. Conjugation in French is a party of special cases. Participes passés?<p>I&#x27;m no authority on the subject, but here&#x27;s what I gathered: during la Renaissance, some aristocrats made a game of overly complexifying the language such that the plebe couldn&#x27;t understand what they were saying. Or just grabbing ideas that look good (participe passé) from other languages (Italian), then sticking to them (while Italian apparently got rid of this silly construction). Also, the basis for French evolution is how authors use the language. The Académie Française looks at what famous authors have written and then use that to define what&#x27;s proper French, what&#x27;s not. While this is not stuff I&#x27;ve researched (only what I&#x27;ve heard from French profs justifying our usage of insane constructs); those are what I believe make for French a worst language to learn than English.<p>My wife studied both French and English as second language and found English to be much easier to learn than French. My personal opinion is biased since I&#x27;m a native French speaker, but still nowaday I find French to be much more cumbersome than English.",1405690234

The exact balance between the two is different depending on the trait, but an argument to the tune of &quot;treat the likelihood of reproducing solely as a genetic trait&quot; isn&#x27;t going to have enough predictive power to say that people who don&#x27;t want to have children are going to die off.<p>The same argument (falsely) applies to homosexuality. Since homosexual people don&#x27;t pass on their genes, surely they must be bred out of the population?

We teamed up with Mattermark to conduct the 2015 Startup Investing Survey in anticipation of the SEC finalizing Title III of the JOBS Act. Title III has the potential to allow anyone—not just accredited investors—to invest in startups. We hope the survey helps demonstrate demand for Title III, and provides us with insight into what the investing landscape would look like if anyone can invest in startups.<p>Check out our Medium post which provides a bit more background. <a href=""https://medium.com/by-quire/the-2015-startup-investing-survey-9563107e5d50"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/by-quire/the-2015-startup-investing-surve...</a><p>And stay tuned to see the results of the Survey.",1441735156

10187249,comment,10183845,10187042,0,0,kasey_junk,,,"Most critics of HFT rely on three major arguments:<p>1) It is a front running operation.<p>2) It has no &quot;social benefit&quot;.<p>3) It increases volatility or structural instability.<p>Items 2 & 3 are not germane to the question of &quot;it is a front running operation&quot;.<p>My response to item 1 is simply, no it&#x27;s not.  If you state it is, then either you have an unclear understanding of how market mechanics work, or a specific natural opposition to HFT systems.  When the OP said that HFT &quot;insert themselves into transactions&quot;, I really wanted him to clarify if he meant &quot;insert&quot; in the sense that he thinks they can change a standing order based on new orders before they execute, or the more general sense of &quot;inserting themselves&quot; that any middleman does in any commercial transaction.  That is, as an expert in sourcing/warehousing/etc items that have varied demand curves.<p>Your response (and the fed&#x27;s part in it) seemed to muddle the responses to items 2 and 3.  My answer (and the common one) to item 2 is that it provides liquidity cheaper than the prior regime.  That is largely not debated, though it is an open question of whether you could provide the same liquidity even cheaper within some other environment (batch auctions etc).<p>The question of whether HFT contributes to high volatility vs acts as a response to it is much more nuanced and I suspect unanswered/unanswerable, but the problem with the Fed specifically speaking to it, is that the Feds own actions are at the heart of the question as well.  A given bank or investment fund service is unlikely to have the systematic impact of the Fed.<p>Finally, notice that the Fed did not speak to whether HFT lowers the cost of trading (ie item 2) they only spoke to the volatility question.  So using the Feds statements as a counter to the argument that HFT lowers the cost of trading does not work.",1441735117

But then you go and look at the source code and find that they are actually using HMAC-SHA256, which does provide authenticity. So the documentation is not an accurate description of what&#x27;s going on, and you need to go and look at the source to find out that it really is okay (in this particular aspect, though it doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence for the future).<p>My point is not to say that this particular library is terrible or anything.

One is a music file, the other is the output of /dev/urandom. They could be of equal size, and they are equally easy to copy. But one contains the results of possibly thousands of hours of human labor not to mention the irreplaceable and ethereal quality we call &#x27;creativity&#x27;, while the other contains no actual information at all.<p>Conflating one with the other based on how easy they are to duplicate amounts to a profound devaluation of human labor and human life.<p>The same sort of argument sounds absurd when applied to physical goods e.g. &quot;a t-shirt is just cotton, so why do we have to pay a premium to a bunch of factory workers?&quot; But it is in fact the same argument, since in reality <i>everything is just information</i> and therefore all labor amounts to the transformation of information. Your t-shirt is just carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, etc. organized in a particular way.<p>(This argument carried further gets really interesting, but I have work to do. Quick version: in a post-3d-printing future where everything is automated, copyright might well be the <i>only form of property</i> and the <i>only mechanism for compensation</i> available to the non-capitalist class.)",1441734564

If you&#x27;ve ever noticed that you learn something better once you teach it to someone else -- well, it works for your students, too.<p>Moreover, if you create a non-judgmental environment in which people are free to talk about their approaches to problems and get feedback not only from you but from other students as well, then just by watching carefully, you will learn some of the more common gaps in understanding.

Since those are two very different statements might be best to clarify which is accurate. When I click play it starts from 0 to 2 seconds on each and every song.

If he wants to see all the albums all he has to do is click on the title &quot;albums&quot; above the three most popular in the search results.

This has been discussed at length, but I think it comes down to pgp being enough of a hassle that people who aren&#x27;t focused on privacy/security don&#x27;t bother using it.<p>With ssh keys, at least we can assume that if someone has a github account they have a private ssh key, and it is accessible through the github api. With pgp there isn&#x27;t a guarantee that they even have a pgp key, and accessibility is on the users themselves to publish it in some way. I think that keybase.io has tried to become the go-to spot for pgp keys, but the adoption is nowhere near what github has, and again, someone has to be interested in privacy/security to want to do this as well.<p>I mean with all do respect that you are correct in terms of a better protocol, and that there are tools that exist that already do this. The concern that I think OP and myself are interested in solving is creating something that is quick, easy, and piggie-backs on top of the huge github userbase and provides a base level of encryption.",1441734012

If the monetary policy is such that one person gets to attend Harvard for free or 4 people get to go to a public college for free ... which should we choose, and why?

Apparently, since the beginning of the Syrian war, there have been some 3 million people who have fled their country to escape war. People are being driven to extraordinarily dangerous actions, just to save their families. So, I have an idea, it&#x27;s superbly fledgling, and really I don&#x27;t have any idea where to begin with it, never mind the skill set currently to implement it - hence why I&#x27;m reaching out to the HN community. Reporters go to great lengths to describe how many of the refugees are connected through their smartphones. So I figured, why not create an app, where individuals in communities refugees are congregating, who have room in their homes, could offer shelter and warmth to refugee families for a few nights could open their doors and be paired with somewhere people could stay. A mixture of coachsurfing and airbnb. The expectation would not be for someone to offer a house and &#x27;adopt a family&#x27; - merely to show someone warmth and welcoming vibes. This is not a solution to the problem of war. Nor is it intended to be a permanent resolution to refugee families problems - it is merely an opportunity to help them feel human once again - to feel safe for a couple of nights and welcome. Often people such as refugees are left to feel sub-human, this would be a chance to integrate them. I lay no claim to this idea - if someone wishes to take the ball and run with it - fine. This is a problem bigger than any one person. It certainly would not be an idea run for profit however. If you can help - reply here, or if you would like to be involved, drop an email to jmcclafe@gmail.com (not a real name - just an email set up for the sake of this project) Help: - First, thoughts on the business - am I just being completely stupid? - How to navigate safety concerns about housing strangers? - How to develop an app? - Any help advertising/funding?",1441733758

I&#x27;d been introduced to the determinant, Gauss--Jordan elimination, and so on, in high school, but all in a very mechanical way.<p>I think this transition between mechanically generating solutions to problems using pattern matching and some basic algorithms on the one hand, and the more mathematically mature approach of exploring problem spaces using pattern matching, some basic algorithms, and intuition can be difficult for many people.<p>It&#x27;s not necessarily the material -- you can get used to almost anything, and even convince yourself it&#x27;s easy or obvious with enough familiarity -- but the lack of intuition.  When you&#x27;re first learning linear algebra, its fundamental unity is not obvious, especially if the instructor does not take pains to point it out.  (And even if the instructor does take pains to point it out -- well, it&#x27;s hard to understand why the instructor is saying we could do this computation this way or that way.)  So in the absence of existing intuition or any perception of unity, linear algebra becomes another target for pattern matching and basic algorithms.<p>As it happens, I&#x27;ve never, ever felt like I didn&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; linear algebra.

My current TV is a Polaroid(!), it&#x27;s a white-label product with the same internals as Panasonics, Toshibas and LGs. It&#x27;s this or nothing. Bought less than a year ago I&#x27;ve already had to have it opened up for fault-finding. More expensive products are definitely better, but not the next level up (the cheaper Toshibas, etc.) but the level above that - which is more by model but I&#x27;d probably include Samsung there. It really is just like the leather boots analogy.<p>Another instance of this for me is trousers. I basically have 2 pairs of trousers for daily wear, one is a pair of jeans. I get supermarket own-brand (UK) jeans, they all wear out at the crotch, the stitching comes apart after about 6-9months. £10 a pair (or less if I catch a sale). Now I could buy more expensive ones that are better made, there&#x27;s an apparent variation in longevity even now Sainsburys > Tesco > ASDA. More expensive trousers - in the past - have never split at the crotch seam. The problem is that the more expensive ones that are still in my price range seem equally likely to fail early.<p>High price doesn&#x27;t indicate high quality but I&#x27;ve found very few products for a relatively low price that weren&#x27;t low quality; often atrocious designs that could be so much better using the same materials too.",1441731921

10186863,comment,10175322,10186696,0,0,foldr,,,"Again, you&#x27;re analyzing what Galileo did with the benefit of hindsight. With hindsight, we know who was using the telescope correctly and who wasn&#x27;t. At the time, you had a complex set of rather fuzzy observations made using a poorly understood instrument, and some of these observations were in conflict with arguably more reliable observations. Feyerabend is pointing out that Galileo wasn&#x27;t right because he was more scientific and more rational than his critics. In that sense, his decisions to accept certain bits of evidence and ignore others (e.g. the apparently obvious fact that the Earth is not in motion) were arbitrary. That is, these decisions did not follow from (and in fact sometimes went against) the scientific method as it is typically enunciated. With hindsight, we can offer a post-hoc rational reconstruction of each decision, but that can&#x27;t be taken seriously as an account of what Galileo was actually doing. So yes, the scientific method is a myth if understood as a set of guidelines the following of which has been a major cause of scientific progress.",1441731891

Von Neumann architecture is prevailing implementation of it because Von Neumann machines prevail. However, functions operating on state w/ I/O don&#x27;t require a CPU or main memory: LISP/Scheme have been directly synthesized to hardware. That means you can describe non-Von Neumann architecture with LISP in a way that produces actual hardware. So, Lambda Calculus being a separate concept and fact that it can use non-Von Neumann implementations mean a Lambda Calculus implementation is non-Von Nuemann but can be if chosen.<p>That&#x27;s what I was thinking. Unless those with more experience in Lambda Calculus, etc tell me [with evidence] that Lambda Calculus is von-Neumann, so is any LISP/Scheme, and never can be implemented alternatively.",1441731780

8012676,comment,8008858,8009282,1,0,malandrew,,,"Try both.<p>I honestly haven&#x27;t spent much time with Ionic and I have a conflict of interest, so take my position with a grain of salt, but AFAICT, thus far we (at famo.us) have spent more time building out the foundation (scene graph, perf optimizations, and physics engine integration) that allows a UI layer like Ratchet, Ionic or Material to be built on top. With that in mind, we haven&#x27;t yet spent as much time on the UI layer, which is something we&#x27;re doing now. Think: solid engine and architecture, but body work and trim in progress. Ionic (and Ratchet) on the other hand spent more time focusing on the UI layer, and is currently in the process of trying to modify the underpinnings to do the types of things famo.us is already capable of doing. Think: sexy looking car with an underpowered engine in the process of being upgraded.<p>However, again, my Ionic experience is pretty limited and a tad dated, so <i>I urge you to do your own experimentation with both to see which best meets your needs right now</i>. Personally, were I an outside developer, I would be choosing between famo.us and ReactJS instead of between famo.us and Ionic, since I&#x27;m personally &quot;magic&quot; averse and don&#x27;t like tight coupling between the UI layer and the underlying layers that make that UI layer possible. The chrome on top is far less important to me (unless the goal is a quick prototype that I&#x27;m certain will be throwaway) than a solid modular architectural foundation that I comfortably know I won&#x27;t be fighting as my app becomes larger and more complex. That being said, my broad generalizations here are based on my Ionic impressions from a few months ago. Things may have changed.<p>To further elaborate on what criteria I would use to choose between famo.us vs ReactJS, it comes down to this:<p>(1) Do I just need a (a) basic interface performance guarantee with discrete changes betweens application state and (b) greater backwards browser compatibility? Is my &quot;app&quot; going to be more traditional web app on desktop (vs Android and iOS like)? => ReactJS<p>(2) Do I need to make an app with not only a performance guarantee, but continuous transitions between application state (animations like those on capptivate.co), and will that application be largely consumed by people with relatively new mobile devices (smart phones or tablets, android or iOS)? => famo.us<p>Lastly, from what I&#x27;ve heard from fellow developers, famo.us and reactjs play pretty nicely together and we&#x27;re going to be working on integration and tutorials between both, so it&#x27;s possible that whichever one you start with today, you can add the other to get the best of both worlds. We&#x27;re also starting work on an EmberJS and famo.us integration, so if you want a lot of the data and routing niceties of emberjs, but the interface niceties of famo.us, there should be tutorials and demo apps coming out in a few months.<p>Another option, which is very new, but gives you a lot of the reactjs benefits, but in a more modular packages that feel better to NodeJS developers is rayno&#x27;s mercury project. It&#x27;s still pretty new and documentation is lacking (which you can contribute to), but it takes the react ideas and breaks them down into smaller rearrangeable pieces.",1404946668

8012669,comment,8010233,8011999,3,0,bravo22,,,"Robert, I&#x27;m fairly certain that is not possible with any BLE system. Main obstacle is that a slave device, such as a beacon, can only be connected to a single master at a time to do things like stock look up or other things you&#x27;ve listed. So while customer A is connected, customer B can not connect. There is also security issue of customer A connecting and then leaving the connection open, denying access to customer B.<p>The way beacons work is turn the problem around. Your phone looks at the beacons that are near it, and make an educated guess as to it&#x27;s location based on relative signal strengths and then go to a web app to fetch the data.<p>Beacons don&#x27;t get a &quot;ping&quot; from the customer. They are, just like their name suggests, beacons. They send a ping out with their id for whoever wants to listen.<p>You can use passive BLE devices to listen for customer&#x27;s BLE device, but only if those devices are in advertising mode which you&#x27;d have to put them into by an app running in the foreground.

8012638,comment,8004812,8011002,1,0,pdonis,,,"<i>> So every single Comcast customer should have to pay for what just the Netflix customers use?</i><p>How did you get that from what I said? I was merely pointing out that you are not paying Comcast for guaranteed bandwidth; you&#x27;re only paying for some nominal bandwidth that isn&#x27;t actually guaranteed. That&#x27;s true regardless of what the bandwidth is used for.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean every Comcast customer has to pay for the same nominal bandwidth; AFAIK Comcast, like pretty much every ISP, has several &quot;tiers&quot; of service with different nominal bandwidths. If you don&#x27;t need to watch Netflix, you pay for a lower tier of service.<p>The real question is: would you be willing to pay Comcast <i>more</i> for bandwidth that <i>was</i> guaranteed, instead of just nominal? If the answer were &quot;yes&quot;, then Comcast could just charge its Netflix customers, who really want the guaranteed bandwidth, more, and use the proceeds to upgrade its network. But from what you&#x27;ve posted in this thread so far, I would guess your answer is &quot;no&quot;, because you think you&#x27;re already paying Netflix for the service, when in fact you&#x27;re only paying Netflix for access to its content; you&#x27;re not paying them for the bandwidth you actually need to watch the content, because they don&#x27;t provide you bandwidth, Comcast does.<p>The fact that Comcast is going after Netflix for that money instead of its customers would seem to indicate that Comcast thinks the answer is &quot;no&quot; too; they think (apparently correctly) that their customers either don&#x27;t realize or don&#x27;t care that the Comcast network they are currently paying for is not sufficient to stream Netflix content to the number of Comcast customers that want to watch it. So since, from Comcast&#x27;s point of view, they can&#x27;t get their customers to pay for upgrading their network to handle Netflix traffic in high volume, they&#x27;re trying to get Netflix to pay instead. Which ultimately means the customers (i.e., you) are going to pay anyway, since Netflix is going to pass on the increased cost of accessing Comcast&#x27;s (and other ISPs&#x27;) network somehow.<p>(Btw, please bear in mind that I&#x27;m stating all this from Comcast&#x27;s point of view, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I agree with Comcast&#x27;s point of view. From my point of view, Comcast should already have been upgrading its network, using the extra money they&#x27;ve been getting by extracting monopoly rents for many years now. But the fact is that they haven&#x27;t, so there is now a capability gap that needs to be filled somehow. Filling it by allowing Comcast to charge Netflix for faster access to its network just means Comcast&#x27;s customers end up paying, as I said above. Net neutrality is at least an attempt to make ISPs, instead of users, pay for the upgrades they should have already done but didn&#x27;t.)",1404946074

A DSL signal cannot pass through a properly installed and working load coil, while voice service cannot be maintained past a certain distance without such coils.

Groovy only gives some syntactic tersity via collection syntax, closures (though now obsolete with Java 8), and getter/setter syntax, nothing more.<p>[1] <a href=""http://groovy.codehaus.org/For+those+new+to+both+Java+and+Groovy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groovy.codehaus.org/For+those+new+to+both+Java+and+Gr...</a>",1404944687

We don&#x27;t, at the same time, have to shorten lives, increase brutality, etc. (Democracy is a mixed bag at best, though; for example, in 1783 France was a troubled but basically functional absolute monarchy, and by 1793 it was a universal suffrage democracy that guillotined tens of thousands in the streets of Paris and bound books in leather made from human skin.

8012497,comment,8010124,8010627,1,0,chton,,,"I took it to mean that the problem would not be given in this way unless there was an exact solution.  In the stated version, there are no degrees of freedom specified, so there can be no degrees of freedom in the solution.  In that way, the proof wouldn&#x27;t work if the problem stated \n&quot;A six inch high cylindrical hole is drilled through the center of a sphere with radius R. How much volume is left in the sphere?&quot;<p>In that case, the solution might be dependent on R, and we&#x27;d have to go through the long version.  Without that mention of R, unless the problem is wrongly stated, it must be constant.<p>So it&#x27;s still an invalid inductive proof, but it&#x27;s a lot stronger than just assuming that because there is a question there is a constant answer.",1404943419

As an anecdote, my wife purchased a new laptop last week.  The windows activation code they sent us was invalid and microsoft and the vendor spent three days pointing fingers before the vendor agreed to fix it.  Their fix was for me to ship the computer back and wait two weeks for them to deliver us a new one.  One hour of my time is worth more than she can make in two weeks with no computer, so I just installed Linux and we went on our merry way.<p>Before anyone from the Apple camp chimes in, I had a similar experience with my old laptop, which was a Mac where the file system corrupted itself every time it went to sleep.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that Linux doesn&#x27;t get ugly.  It does.  I&#x27;ve had the failed sound cards and bad printers.  Hell, I&#x27;m old enough to remember screwing around with trying to get a WinModem to run.

That probably just depends on your occupation.",1404943224

But wouldn't it be easier to solve if you just rethought the shape of things?  Instead of a three-light assembly with hoods over each light (where snow can build up on top of the hood for the next lower light), just reshape the traffic signal as a box with the lights on the back, the four sides opaque (to block glare and peripheral view), and the front side transparent plastic of some variety?  There are surely engineering issues there too (like preventing glare off the clear plastic), but it seems like a more stable system, no worries about snow accumulation, and it's probably cheaper to manufacture too.",1262818457

The whole idea is coming straight out of left field:<p><i>Sometimes, private methods are created to split complex logic or processes into small, easily digested pieces. Often, such private methods have gnarly dependencies because they directly access or modify internal state. Moving these methods to appropriate collaborators (again, creating new classes as necessary) exposes such dependencies. Eliminating these dependencies simplifies the new API, which improves readability and understanding.</i><p>Here he seems to be complaining about bugs that arise due to overly complex mutable state.  However that has nothing to do with private methods.  The defensible assertion here might be that if you have a big ugly method that has too many state dependencies, then refactoring it into private methods isn't really an improvement even if it appears more readable.  However that's a string of failures that only incidentally have anything to do with private methods.  It would be more accurate to just state that non-functional code is a smell, increasing in putrescence as a function of the quantity of moving parts.<p><i>The resulting code is simpler, more testable, more reusable, more cohesive, and less coupled.</i><p>Again, the correlation of privateness to these concerns is dubious.  Separation of concerns should be on a logical basis, not based on the structure of the implementation.  Every additional class adds mental overhead.  Decoupling is useful as a means of reusing code, but only if there is a case for reuse.  It's also useful as a way to tease apart complex dependency graphs, but only if the resultant sets of dependencies make sense on their own.  Also, let's not forget that encapsulating concerns in separate objects is no more functional than a bunch of private state if you end up passing around objects anyway... Law of Demeter and all that.<p>What I suspect here is that the author saw some bad code that used a lot of private methods and then honed in on that as a smell even though it has little general applicability.

If you look at nicely typeset material, the bullets are typically indented slightly rather than lined up exactly with the left margin, which gives a visual cue like the indent on the first line of a new paragraph (or a vertical space between paragraphs).<p>Hanging quotes fully in the margin is poor, too. The point of hanging punctuation is to optically align the margins so that they look straighter to the reader, because small glyphs like quotation marks and hyphens don't fill the space as much as typical letter forms. The idea is to avoid a distracting ""bump"" where the text appears to have a small indent, even though mathematically it doesn't; thus the technique complements the sort of thing you should be doing with bullets. But this is a subtle effect, and hanging punctuation fully in the margins like that certainly doesn't achieve this goal: in fact, it's probably just as bad as not hanging at all. (If you want to do it as a stylistic/aesthetic thing on block quotations or something, I'm not complaining, but this article presents it as an absolute rule for normal text.)<p>The whole Fibonacci/golden ratio thing is just silly, too. Who says these things have a natural elegance? Where is the research, or even the study of more than the three people in the room, to back this up?<p>Then there's what should have been a good point about emphasis, which completely misses the point of different typographic effects. Italics are subtle effects that show emphasis as you read without grabbing the attention, so useful for indicating things like stress or distinguishing foreign words. Heavy type, on the other hand, affects the typographic colour and draws the eye across the page. This makes it very bad for the uses of italics above (which are unhelpful out of context) but excellent for highlighting key words being defined or headings. Underlining in printed material is almost always a mistake (it distracts the eye and slows reading speed, and is unnecessary when we have proper italics available anyway) and on web pages should probably be reserved for hyperlinks since anything else clashes with user expectations.<p>I'm sorry, but this really isn't a guide to good typography at all, beginner or otherwise.

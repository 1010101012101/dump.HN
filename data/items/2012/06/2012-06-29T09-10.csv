So what is the revenue model?<p>If the idea is to follow Amazon's Kindle Fire (where revenue from content sold in future, justifies the at-cost pricing of the device), is it not a huge risk? Google Play is not established as a revenue generator yet.<p>What about the content itself? Does Google have agreement in place with content owners? Even if Google has agreements, in reality that won't cover all geographies. What happens in those geographies where Google can sell apps and other stuff but not media content? Won't the tablet be sold there or will it be priced higher?<p>Also, how does Asus make money or are they just a contract manufacturer?",1340963935

I think people in general overestimate the time they have available to do things and underestimate the time it takes to actually do it; which inevitibly leads to situations where you think you can make up for ""lost"" time by sprinting forward, tomorrow. The most valuable lesson I learned about productivity is that small actions, done now, can lead to huge productivity gains tomorrow. The hard part of course is to subconsciously justify to yourself that those small actions are actually making significant progress towards your end goal. It's important not to get discouraged and keep charging ahead.<p>What's more insidious are those ""busy working"" tasks that can consume your day where you actually feel productive, but haven't made any real progress towards where you want to be.<p>There's an excellent TED talk by Daniel Goldstein about the present and future self; highly recommended: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_goldstein_the_battle_between_your_present_and_future_self.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_goldstein_the_battle_between...</a>",1340962834

A lot of smart devs are already taking a similar approach with CSS, serving up a minimal 'print' stylesheet for oldIE [1] [2].<p>- If you're using JS for progressive enhancement on an otherwise static site, e.g. form validation, pjax, image carousels, tabs, animations... simply drop that JS for 6-8. Form validation should just round-trip to the server as it has to do anyway, pages should just link normally, other visual enhancements can be dropped. That's the progressive enhancement way after all.<p>- If you're trying to build a single-page web app for IE 6-8 and this is your reason for wanting jQuery to work, then you're going to find those browsers have JS engines that are <i>incredibly slow</i> and a JS-heavy web app for oldIE is <i>not</i> going to deliver a good user experience even if you get it to 'work'. I think frankly this is an unrealistic goal from the get-go. The pitiful speed of JS on these browsers is something that does seem to be often overlooked.<p>If you absolutely have to push a single-page web app to a corporate customer stuck on oldIE, Chrome Frame is a very sensible option. This has served us well and we've yet to encounter a customer who complains, as long as you give them plenty of forewarning and explanation. It can be tied down to only trigger on your site, so sysadmins really have nothing to gripe about with respect to FUD about attack vectors etc.<p>Anyway I'm not saying 'you definitely shouldn't be serving JS to oldIE' I'm just putting it out there as something to consider, as usual in this business there's no single answer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://css-tricks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://css-tricks.com/</a> (serves a print stylesheet for oldIE - possibly just IE6 I forget)<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/universal_internet_explorer_6_css"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/universal_inter...</a>",1340961916

Being CEO is, and ought to be, far more respectable.  We should be happy that it's as ""easy"" as it is for the guy who only has $500 to his name and invests it in drugs to sell, gets customers and builds his capital until he's balling.  I have some ""respect"" for that business.  We're lucky ours doesn't depend on being illegal, or even ripping anyone off - we should try to hold on to that respect and build it.  If nothing else, so that other people will consider this path more seriously, and so we can be taken more seriously as compared with other business people who didn't build up from scratch.",1340961192

The workaround for this is the blades are made with hollow channels through which cold air is blown, keeping them just cool enough.<p>2) You may be familiar with 'creep' - where materials under stress gradually relax to relieve that stress, even when the stress is lower than the yield stress of the material.  Creep is made worse by (i) repeated stress cycles and (ii) high temperatures.  In a typical jet turbine engine, you have blades spinning at 10000 rpm, at high tempratures, with a few microns clearance to the edge of the turbine housing.  If they were to elongate and rake the edge of the housing at that speed ...",1340961165

We've been using Subversion, but will switch to git once our tools support it (we eat our own dog food, and Subversion is the only revision control system our products support right now).  The determining factor for us was similar, as well...the Perl core developers appear to be moving to git for all Perl development.  We're a mostly Perl shop, so we'll go where Larry and Co. goes.  It just insures that the tool-chain for working with our codebase with git will be really solid, if the majority of Perl developers are also using it.",1206424676

Ok, not really, but its surprising that he could change what was thought to be an essentially solved problem with cvs and then svn.  I would have never thought that someone could come up with a better CVS, but then SVN came out.  Then came Git, and then this.  Just goes to show that even problems that seem ""solved"" might have better solutions given a different set of situations.",1206424413

Here is why: expressing your idea is one form of product development.<p>Writing down your idea in a way that other people understand is absolutely essential. Similarly, practicing for demo day means getting the exact phrasing of a 7 minute talk absolutely perfect.

The problems newspapers face are:<p>a) Most of them don't have much high-quality content. The majority of their content is syndicated from other sources.<p>b) It's expensive to produce high-quality content. And expensive to disseminate it as well. It may be cheaper to do so online, but the ad revenues are lower.<p>My startup is helping to solve both problems. We'll enable news publishers to increase the quality of their content, with fewer people.",1206421638
145452,comment,144998,144998,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I personally think it's the wrong approach to learning a language. Plain memorization is not how languages are learned. There is a lot of context and structure that must be learned that isn't apparent  in the lessons (just listen to someone with a foreign native language speak English. They will construct sentences with English words but will do so incorrectly. They are putting them together how they would if they were using their own language's words).<p>I certainly think this is a problem ripe for hacking, but I think the application won't stick. What I've seen so far is a decent supplement to a traditional course for those who want to broaden their vocabulary repository, but not (IMO) a complete way to learn a language.<p>Another note: What about for people who already know a portion of a certain language? Maybe you could implement a test that checks where they are and provides lessons accordingly.",1206421632

Using the Google ""Do No Evil"" mantra as a pretense, he asked me how many people I'd killed when I served. When I explained to him that I was MI, he then asked if I could estimate how many people were killed because of the intelligence I'd gathered. The implication was I was either an evil, efficient killer or an incompetent one - a real no-win situation.<p>The right answer would be to talk about all the military and civilian lives that were saved because of the intelligence gathered. The comments on the post talk about how such a question was a huge violation of US labor law.",1206421576

However even a casual glance shows a lot of modded up comments that are of a latter kind. Especially in the Ask YC/HN articles. While reasonable encouraging is good, there's also a plenty of <i>great job</i> and <i>looking good</i> comments for pre-launch projects that are a plain junk .. with an emphasis on <i>pre-launch</i>. In my humble opinion these are extremely damaging comments regardless of how polite they are.<p>Perhaps this is a part of the site social culture. Or perhaps I'm misreading the meaning of ""less polite"". I just hope I'm wrong on both counts.<p>Now, mod me down if you agree :-p",1206421254

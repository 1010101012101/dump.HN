I use a CPAP for the apnea.  <p>I feel like I have jet lag if I miss a little sleep.  If I miss a great deal of sleep, my symptoms worsen dramatically...I had a stroke when I was 30 after being sleep deprived for too long, for example.  <p>I was able to do all-nighters without a problem until I was a senior in college.  Then, I worked night shift for seven years to make it easier to cope.  The sleep issue was yet another motivator for starting my own company.  ",1191967141

The correlation I read about was 40%, over a number of studies. It would be interesting to know if this had been updated, since I know individual cases belie it.

65494,comment,65408,65488,0,0,DaniFong,,,"The thing is that intelligence isn't some kind of nice, statistically normed quantity. There's more to most variables than a mean and a standard deviation -- so I don't know why people seem to always think that you can restrict a discussion of intelligence to such concepts.<p>One thing that is actually correct is that there's more variation in gene expression between men and women. On of the reasons for this is because, chromosomally, women have two X chromosomes, which pair up, and then randomly one or another turns off. These means that the gene expression is mixed between both parents.<p>On the other hand, the Y chromosome is largely only effective at turning off gene expression. You can see how there's less redundancy here. <p>But intelligence isn't a gene. Researchers have, since the time of Dalton, tried to find a simple, biological basis for genius. You know, memory capacity, reaction times, brain size, brain structure convolution, etc. They haven't found anything -- literally everything has turned out to be a false start, even brain size, which, has been shown, within families does not even predict g.<p>In the mid ranges, there are greater standard deviations, yes. But every single normed test is normed on a sample on the order of 1000. They're designed for regular people. The designer of the Weschler has adamantly opposed the use of IQ tests for anything other than clinical settings, for this reason. It's just no good at drawing conclusions on the extremes of ability.<p>A better guide might be actual performance. The IOI this year had more girls than ever before -- 11. That's nearly 300% more than last year, where they had 4, and one medal. They are:<p>Emina Bukva (Bosnia and Herzegovina)\nConstanza Contreras (Chile)\nAnna Currel (Spain)\nRomina Huenchunao (Chile)\nVaiva Imbrasaite (Lithuania)\nTaksapaun Kittiakrastien (Thailand) [Silver]\nSepideh Mahabadi (Iran) [Gold!]\nRadwa Metwali (Egypt)\nKatie O'Mahony (Ireland)\nPhitchaya Phothilimthana (Thailand) [Silver]\nYe Wang (USA) [Silver]<p>Sepideh Mahabadi had one of the best performances of anyone. If you're familiar with IOI scoring, only the top 1/12 are to get golds, and 2/12 to get silvers, thus 1 gold and 3 silvers out of 11 implies that they did at least as good as the boys, and in fact somewhat better.<p>Were the 'standard deviation' explanation correct they should have, instead, had 0.4 girls earning maybe 0.01 medals. It just doesn't work. Psychometrics are a non-science.",1191965814

65491,comment,65408,65469,0,0,Tichy,,,"There is definitely something cultural to being able to remember sequences of numbers in reverse: I am sure societies that don't have a concept of numbers would have a much harder time with it... As for the geometric shapes, remember the example of the africans building 2d models of the 3d drawing. It seems likely that there is a cultural component to seeing abstract shapes. The Kanji example was perhaps bad - OK, think about recognising kaukasian and chinese faces. They are just faces, no? But somehow it is hard for many kaukasians to tell chinese people apart, and presumably vice versa. I don't think that is genetic, it is trained. It makes me think twice about the cultural aspects of recognising ""geometric shapes"".<p>For completeness I want to mention that I don't doubt that IQ tests measure something. Like if they predict success in the military or whatever, they are probably right, ie the IQ63 guy from Ethopia (from another post) would probably have a much harder time in the US military than the IQ 100 American. It is just not clear that it measures ""intelligence"" per se. And perhaps for the Ethopian military, the results would be reversed. Ie try putting up ""surviving in the Saharah without water"" as an IQ test.",1191965193

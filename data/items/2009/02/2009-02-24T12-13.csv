Everyone and their brother uses Google/Gmail, the only thing you're doing here is letting everyone know you're were the first on the scene.

And you should look at yourself, too, because people are typically friends with people of the same social standing as themselves.<p>I long for a day when more people realize that while you may <i>think</i> that you're waving a flaming sword of righteousness, everybody else understands that such complaining just means you are too weak to do anything to change it.",1235478560

Using integers (or even decimals) and without rounding, 0 years and 9 months is really zero. One will start 12 months (or the number of months the calendar is using) after the date of birth.<p>Edge cases, I would estimate, would account for 30% of a program's logic. When doing the first cut, I classify those as exceptions: abnormal values that generate, well, exceptions.<p>Time-bound edge cases are abundant, especially in financial apps. End of periods, beginning balances, ending balances.<p>Other edge-case values are max and minimum values, limits of whatever sort. And these don't include limits of systems, like how many times a stored procedure can be dropped and recreated, that are not commonly known or just ignored hoping the app will hold before the longint limit will be reached.",1235478426

425809,comment,425179,425787,0,0,Jebdm,,,"I'd say that some of the ads are somewhat pornographic, yeah.  That said, I think it's fairly standard practice for anyone producing pornographic material, and more importantly anything which could be construed as pornographic, to get a release, just to be safe.  In fact, people almost always try to cover their asses legally; companies doing ""iffy"" stuff often check to make sure it's legal first, etc.  Thus, it's not clear that they know they are making pornographic ads OR that they think their models look underage, just from that evidence, even if those are both true.<p>As for the photos: like I said before, they don't look underage to me.  I've additionally checked this with a few  people in other age ranges of both genders, just to be sure I wasn't crazy, and the consensus was that they all looked like adults.<p>P.S. The ""If you don't agree with me, you're <insert x here>"" approach is a bit silly.  I do like to consider myself pretty open-minded, though :)",1231455480

Security of people in the private sector is probably very different than military security, and I bet government administration security also has a third set of objectives and concerns.

Where it is absolutely necessary, when things just don't get done & no positive equilibrium forms, introduce it. Not as a 'right' any more then a government contract is a right. Just a rule of the game that allows medicine to be developed or technology to improve.<p>I can't possibly see how disappearing music IP would hurt society in aggregate. I dare say music would still be made. The dynamic of the industry would be completely different. Maybe there would be a 10% loss of revenue industry wide. maybe 25% or 50% or even 90%. That still probably leaves a bigger industry then sculpting or comic theatre. Music is very popular. It will not disappear tomorrow.<p>Even in medicine I think it is possible there would be some gains. After all, it's a huge market & will remain so. I'm not sure that public funding for research wouldn't be just as good as private patent-chasing funding it would need to replace. There is a lot of inefficiency in the system now anyway.<p>New antibiotics (probably the most important single class of medicine) are not profitable to develop. A patient take 1 course & then goes home. If you price them high, then doctors will prescribe a different antibiotic. But a new antibiotic will save lives as it will probably work in some end cases where existing ones don't. It's also a bit of insurance against future resistant strains. But the economy for developing antidepressants, cosmetics or some other long term treatment drugs with potentially fewer cheap substitutes is much stronger.<p>This is really pushing it. I don't know to analyse all the economic outcomes. But I know I see no strong moral reason for IP laws other then those that generate the most well being for society.<p>*In reality transitioning would be hugely difficult.

They take better advantage of the available space, are better integrated, and probably (knowing palm's history) will require fewer clicks to do useful things.  Palm's always done a good job in these areas, and the competition's been weak.<p>Also, the GPS application looks like a modern self-contained GPS, not the google-maps-with-a-dot version on the iPhone.<p>As for using HTML/JS, it's lowering the bar for people to develop, almost to the floor.<p>Finally, Palm's got a tired, but well-recognized leader name.

I had plans a while ago to make a website and rss feed which would inform you of upcoming votes, and vote decisions made by your congressperson and locally elected officials. This would allow you to be informed on the issues you care about, as well as being able to quickly send notice to the elected official before a vote takes place, either through thumbs up/down, quick comments, twitter, SMS, etc.<p>If done well, the site would become a treasure trove of information on the concerns in particular districts thus enabling any would be competitor to quickly campaign on the issues that a district cares about.

Moreover, I know from previous articles about AA that they make the models sign releases confirming they are of age. However, I think that makes it worse and I'd like to explain why.<p>We already know that what constitutes porn is in fact subjective and was ""officially"" defined as such by the Supreme Court:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio</a><p>So what I'd like to point out is that the very reason that AA needs that little signature is because they know they are (1) making pornographic ads and (2) using models that look underage. If either of those two were untrue, the free-wheeling, open-minded people at AA would surely not resort to legal means to cover their ass.<p>As far as not providing evidence, what is harder evidence than actual photos of AA ads?

I use MySpace to listen to a few tracks to get a feel for them. I never use MySpace to find new music. For that I use a variety of sources including Oh My Rockness (highly recommended if you are in Chicago, LA or NYC).",1231452740

425742,comment,425650,425672,0,0,Jebdm,,,"I like the design (though perhaps a bit gradient-heavy, I prefer flat) but you should definitely add some sort of tagline, or at least put the ""what is zipalong"" link in a different color or something; I didn't even see it the first time I opened the site.  Just seeing a login form, I immediately closed the tab.  Good thing I read the comments, because this looks really cool.<p>One small usability tip: you could pretty easily combine the login and registration forms.  Just put an extra ""register"" button, do a username check, then add a second password box and the name fields.  Also, it'd be a little nicer (though I see what you're doing with the in-one-line thing) if you stacked the password confirmation box under the other; I usually visually compare the lengths before hitting ""enter"".<p>Also, I noticed that the look and feel is in many ways similar to Flickr, especially the colors.  I don't know if that's a positive or a negative; on the one hand, it will immediately associate your site with photography for anyone who's used Flickr before, while on the other hand it may make it harder to establish a unique brand.<p>I haven't explored the inside of the site much, but from what I can tell, you've done a pretty good job.  Keep up the good work, and good luck.",1231452474

Hackers love honesty, no matter how brutal, most people simply aren't like that. I don't mind a brutal critique so long as it includes advice on how to be better if I'm just starting something.

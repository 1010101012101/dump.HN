But I ran into a few issues.
1) Facebook login does not work, I used Twitter
2) The first time I clicked the Wish bookmarklet on an Amazon product, it just froze, had to do a it a multiple times
That said, I can see it using regularly, definitely better than placing items in &#x27;Save for Later&#x27; list on Amazon

9199184,comment,9196231,9198681,0,0,balabaster,,,"That&#x27;s not at all what I&#x27;m saying. You&#x27;re twisting my words to fit your own agenda...<p>What I&#x27;m saying is they were drunk and horny and wanted sex - both parties, consensual (from the way the media portrayed it.) Not rape. It wasn&#x27;t until <i>after</i> the fact that she backtracked and changed her mind and decided that she retroactively didn&#x27;t want sex after all and cried rape.<p>That&#x27;s like me going back to a partner and saying, yeah, I know we had sex last night, but I&#x27;m regretting it now because I heard you had sex with my room mate, so I&#x27;m going to report you for rape. Which is exactly how it was portrayed.<p>Making a shitty decision to have sex with someone while under the influence of alcohol is entirely different than getting shit-face drunk (or drugged) and getting raped. These are two entirely different scenarios. The first is what I&#x27;m getting at - bad decision to have (consensual) sex, regretting it after the fact; the second is what you&#x27;re getting at - getting too drunk to be in charge of your own destiny and unable to fend yourself off from someone you don&#x27;t want sex with - this is rape and is inexcusable. In the scenario you&#x27;re presenting, I&#x27;m entirely in agreement with you, but that&#x27;s not the scenario as I perceived it, nor as I presented it. As the media presented it, I didn&#x27;t see any real victim. I saw someone that played the victim card only as a result of coercion. The way her testimony was portrayed, I&#x27;m not even convinced that <i>she</i> felt she was a victim, she was a willing participant and only seemed to be going along with the rape allegation as part of some outside coercion or pressure. I genuinely read it like she had some affection for him and that she was sexually into him.<p>My point regarding the getting drunk and driving a dangerous piece of equipment is about legal culpability with regards to the ability to make decisions while under the influence of alcohol - not victim blaming. It&#x27;s not about the indirect consequences of her decisions.  It&#x27;s about making a decision to participate in sex while under the influence of alcohol. In the legal sense this is no different than making a decision to drive a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. If you&#x27;re legally considered to have the mental capacity to make decisions in one scenario, you&#x27;re legally considered to have the mental capacity to make decisions in the other.<p>If someone decides to have sex with someone while under the influence of alcohol, they can&#x27;t use the legal excuse they were drunk. In exactly the same way as you can&#x27;t get into a car accident and claim legal immunity because you were were drunk. In other words, you cannot be deemed legally able to make a decision in one scenario but not the other because you&#x27;re drunk.<p>If it <i>was</i> rape and indeed it was non-consensual on her part, then her being drunk is irrelevant, just as it would be irrelevant what she was wearing. Rape is rape. But this was not portrayed as rape.",1426273150

To me, most Rolex watches just look like massive hunks of metal. Seriously, the size and weight of some of these watches is really ridiculous to me.<p>Also, mechanical watches do not last centuries without being serviced repeatedly every ~5 years. Servicing a high-end mechanical watch can easily cost many hundreds, if not more.<p>Many mechanical watches are also not automatic, which means you do indeed have to &quot;charge&quot; them every day (hand-wind them). For instance, Nomos is my personal favorite watch brand of all time, and while they have a mixture of manual and automatic watches, their highest-end offerings (about $20k) are all manual.<p>Finally, you mentioned TAG, and one of their best known watches is square: the Monaco.",1426273120

Sometimes the workflow is different enough so you genuinely don&#x27;t need it - the average ASP.NET developer probably doesn&#x27;t have any need for them. Sometimes the developer just doesn&#x27;t know any better - and you see that kind on all systems. Sometimes they&#x27;ve developed a PowerShell proficiency or something that lets them use analogous tools in an analogous ways. But this just isn&#x27;t an argument. It&#x27;s effectively saying, &quot;well, if you do web development like I do, you need *nix.&quot; Well, of course! :) For most of them, it would be equally unimaginable to switch. I think there&#x27;s very few like me, who have actively done and enjoyed both professionally.<p>There are, of course, exceptions: I think we can all agree that almost all ASP.NET developers are on Windows and almost all Ruby developers are on OS X or maybe Linux. Most of the amateurs are certainly on Windows - I don&#x27;t mean that in a disparaging way, I just mean the people just starting out and putting together very simple, possibly static webpages, or playing around with whatever their CMS has set up for them. Then you have all the enterprisey web development, likely mostly internal sites, with somewhat less of a skew, but still probably majority Windows. For the professional, public-facing sort of stuff, I expect its a lot closer to 50/50. Of course, just like you say, it&#x27;s very hard to demonstrate anything and anecdote-by-anecdote and gut-feeling doesn&#x27;t really say much.",1426272779

The real core of this entire issue is not the methods but more the cost, it is ultimately a conversation about saving money NOT about some finite limitation on water in real terms.<p>California could solve this issue with a pen stroke, it just might hurt their farmers, which is really what all the concern is about. If water doubled or more in price (which is realistic), that is expensive for farmers who need a ton of the stuff for their crops. So will supermarkets pay 30% more or will they look abroad?<p>I actually think even with a higher water bill, it will still be cheaper for US retailers to buy US produce. Shipping that stuff by ocean isn&#x27;t exactly cheap with the price of oil. I think where it would hurt US farms is their exports to Europe in particular, Europe is in a geographical position to buy from either the east or west, both by ocean. So if US/California crops go up in cost they might just buy them from someone else.<p>But let us not pretend that either shipping water in from other states OR just distilling water isn&#x27;t an option for California, because it is.

There&#x27;s no reason to punish them or &quot;tax&quot; them for this.<p>Even if you could somehow determine that they <i>never</i> will accept it (rather than just being slow), those people are still necessary to keep the consensus honest. Without them, there won&#x27;t be any criticism left, and then it just becomes a game for jackasses to try to get people to chant &quot;scientific consensus&quot; enough that everyone else must accept it instantly or be punished for not doing so.<p>What you&#x27;re talking about isn&#x27;t &quot;consensus&quot; at all, it&#x27;s groupthink.<p>And it&#x27;s pretty fucking sad that you&#x27;ve confused one for the other.",1426271928

Stunning history, the looming drought was inevitable.<p>TL;DR/DW - the only reason CA has a vibrant agricultural component is because enormous amounts of water are being taken from other states and used very inefficiently. There&#x27;s a hard limit on what can be redirected, and increasing demand around those sources to keep what&#x27;s being taken.<p>Sometimes a supply-and-demand curve has a brick wall: when demand outstrips supply, cost goes from dirt-cheap to incredibly expensive fast. This is often derided as &quot;price gouging&quot;, but is a natural consequence of basic needs being supplied cheaply vs insufficiently. CA artificially increasing its water supply faces exactly that: natural growth of demand will slam into lack of sufficient supply, and those with the funds to purchase from the supply at near-any price will suddenly destroy the market for those enjoying necessities at barely-affordable prices.",1426271919

The same ability is required of startup founders. Those who can define structure for themselves, even without external instruction, and then execute within that structure, will always succeed before those who cannot.<p>Because this ability is so rare, and necessarily present in startup founders, we can logically assume that a higher percentage of <i>startup founders</i> have the ability than the percentage of others who do. Or, at least we can assume that startup founders are the most well-practiced in this ability to execute within their own structure.<p>This means <i>many of</i> (not all!) the people who are best at managing work-life balance (a requirement for a productive remote employee), are already founding startups. So the best remote employees are selected out of the hiring pool if they decide to found startups instead. This leaves you with a plethora of less-competent potential remote employees, who are not as skilled at managing their own work-life balance as the best of them.<p>A risk when hiring a remote team is that you recruit too many employees who cannot properly manage their own work-life balance, and therefore suffer productivity losses.

Promises of &#x27;smart meters&#x27; or &#x27;water markets&#x27; are often delayed with time tables being pushed further and further back. Meanwhile the government also hands out large subsidies to grow a wide variety of crops, most recently the federal government has encouraged corn for biofuel, more corn is being grown for biofuel than is being used for livestock (and effects of carbon usage for biofuel is likely 0 or even negative once you take in effect it&#x27;s entire life cycle). Typically ever pound of beef takes 7 pounds of corn, pork is 5 to 1, poultry is around 3 to 1.

So for the arrest warrant to be technically valid, the Swedish prosecutor had to insist that while Assange was technically wanted only for questioning and no decision had been made to indict him, the prosecution was in an &quot;advanced&quot; state and he was virtually guaranteed to be charged.

Most important, the conserved evolutionary-kernel of JS is &quot;good enough&quot; (worse is better, look it up -- sorry about the warts but not sorry, we have to deal with the world as it is).<p>Therefore no browser (not even Chrome yet) has both the means and the motivation to invest lots of megabucks in engineering high-performance, multiple language runtime tenants sharing the DOM and the rest of the browser APIs.<p>Compile to JS sucks away the oxygen from any such boondoggle. There are multiple Python-to-JS compilers out there. With modern JS (both language and VM-level optimizations), you can get higher fidelity Python this way than you would have by forking and freezing Python 1.3.<p>* XHTML2 was revolution, not evolution. It proposed to replace HTML on the web, not even interoperating well with HTML via the DOM, before we founded the WHATWG and did HTML5. HTML was originally an SGML fork that, as it evolved, bent or violated lots of SGML rules in favor of flat vocabulary, ad-hoc error correction, implicit content models (I perpetrated implicit CDATA for <script>), and worse-is-better.<p>XHTML would yellow-screen-of-death if it didn&#x27;t validate, and because IE loading the most popular MIME type would error-correct as HTML, even hard-core XML purists would commit errors to published content, unaware. This plus the better-is-better overhead and complexity of authoring XHTML (XML namespaces in particular) led to ~0 adoption.<p>* On me vs. Dart, as on your assertion that multiple runtime integration is much less complex than unstated Mozilla work, you have yet to cite sources. I&#x27;m bored by such cheap shots, so will wrap up here with a few thoughts about Dart and its opportunity costs. Feel free to have last words.<p>If you care to read my past HN comments, I railed against the Google &quot;Dash&quot; memo for being two-faced about &quot;we <3 JS; we must REPLACE JS&quot;, about the latent and very large conflict of interest for Google as self-congratulatory standards bearer: investing in Dart at the expense of JS.<p>Indeed Google has probably sunk tens of millions into Dart with very little to show for it. Elsewhere here, you asked or assumed that Google uses Dart in its web properties. Does it? So far, I hear it does not, and I&#x27;ve asked Googlers. You should not assume.<p>UPDATE via twitter, thanks to @rightisleft -- some Google services use Dart now:<p><a href=""https://www.dartlang.org/community/who-uses-dart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dartlang.org/community/who-uses-dart.html</a><p>This means dart2js, which means Google should&#x27;ve already helped get bignums into ES6 :-|. END UPDATE LOL<p>Dart cost Google some V8 competitiveness, vs. other engines. The whole Aarhus team (except for moonlighters) switched to Dart; a new V8 team had to be recruited in Munich. You could say it&#x27;s Google&#x27;s choice on how to invest, and of course I agree, just considering business ethics.<p>But not for &quot;Google the good&quot; as standards bearer. There, the effect on JS standardization and real progress vs. the feared/hated mobile native stacks&#x27; languages (C++, ObjC on iOS) -- by such evolutions as asm.js/WebGL for games, and something like SoundScript for larger hand-coded apps -- was significantly delayed.<p>Big companies can work for and against the grain of the web. Elsewhere on this thread, a commenter replied to me about how ActiveX went against the grain (very true). Stuff like NaCl, Pepper, and Dart run the same wrong way, at first and even in the long run -- whether open source (open-washing a project dominated and controled by paid contributors is a hazard, even at Mozilla) or even de-jure standardized (Ecma is pay-to-play). The only way they&#x27;d get into other browsers is via market power of the 95% monopoly share kind that IE enjoyed around 2002.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s why I railed against the &quot;Dash&quot; memo. The delay in reconstituting the V8 team, and in coming up with something like SoundScript instead of Dart, is relevant to this current thread. If the topic of what&#x27;s both practical to evolve from JS, and better for developers over against compile-to-JS approaches, is worth arguing about, then I&#x27;ll argue that Google let the world down by doing Dart.<p>Evolution delayed, but not denied, still hurts. I&#x27;m glad to see the new V8 team proposing experiments like this one.",1426271108

Even so, put together a master document that points to everything they’ll need.<p><i>Make sure to return all your equipment in good shape, and do it quickly</i> — Most of the time, you are just borrowing company property. You should return it in good shape, just like you would want your own property returned if you lent it out.<p><i>Reach out to your closest co-workers to make sure they’re part of your network before you go</i> — Your network is one your most valuable assets for finding future career opportunities.<p><i>Reach out to your colleagues to say goodbye and share your contact information</i> — If you’ve done all these things, you’ve left a great impression. Make sure your old co-workers know how to find you if they need someone like you in the future. And be sure to reach out to your closest co-workers to personally say goodbye whenever possible.<p><i>Be vague and use positive language in your exit interview</i> — It feels strange to advocate for being vague, but the exit interview is one of the times when it’s necessary.

9198840,comment,9198260,9198689,0,0,jonnathanson,,,"My understanding is that California is so ideal for agriculture because of its climate (with the water scarcity being the big liability, the can we&#x27;ve been kicking down the road for decades). Other states, either individually or collectively, do not have the year-round, Mediterranean, relatively predictable climate to take on the load that California would drop. This includes not only total square acreage of arable, mild farmland, but also a bevy of specific crops that cannot be grown reliably in other states. (There are certainly wetter states, but they have seasonal extremes that make X, Y, Z crops very challenging.)<p>When it comes to agriculture, California is in the rare position of being a jack of all trades and master of <i>most</i>.

In fact, 50-70 percent of home water is used for watering lawns and gardens.Nearly 14 percent of the water a typical homeowner pays for is never even used—it leaks down the drain.

All combat was real time - you&#x27;re ability to deflect enemy spells, block attacks (as a fighter), or chuck a stream of daggers was all reliant on your fast-twitch skills.<p>And the humor – in one quest arc you had to repair a cable car to get to science island, pass a ridiculous multiple choice quiz:<p>2. What is the goal of the True Scientist?
a) To get tenure at a major university and be set for life.
b) To impress babes with your towering intellect.
c) To plot to take over the world!
d) All of the above.<p>And then, to gain the scientist&#x27;s acceptance, you had to construct the perfect pizza out of ingredients scavenged in the field (how&#x27;s that for crafting?).

California had similar issues with mild winters and the reduced water associated with them back in the 1930s. [1][2] The difference now of course is that there are a great many more people there and a great many more farms.<p>The Bureau of Reclamation is pretty much at fault for the lack of water available for human consumption because of mismanagement and prices below the cost which encouraged over development of farming.<p>The current drought can likely be traced to changes in the Pacific Ocean dating to 1976 [3]. As in, we have more than time enough to see something was changing.<p>What can be done? Rationing won&#x27;t solve it all. The states need to have more control over the water that the Bureau of Reclamation currently controls. They are in a far better position to understand their needs and cooperate amongst each other instead of using the weight of Washington politics to force a way.<p>First and foremost priorities have to be set and reasonable prices for the cost of water need to be assigned. Yes this will likely mean a reduction in farming but it is artificially propped up now by unrealistically low water prices. People also need to understand conservation and large lawns should either be restricted or the water use for such maintenance needs to be surcharged.<p>The key is better use of resources and not redirecting the problem which is more mismanagement than natural causes.<p>note, I haven&#x27;t read much on site #2, but they consolidated nicely some NOAA charts which make it easier to view.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/061/mwr-061-09-0251.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/061/mwr-061-09-0251.pdf</a>

This means that the market never acts to regulate how much water you use. People will use less water if it costs them more.<p>However, changing to a market system for water would never happen overnight. People are not used to paying for water and cannot move on a dime. However, long term I think it is our only solution. The midwest, who many on HN seem to have a bad impression of, has the world&#x27;s largest fresh water reserve in the world (the great lakes). Meanwhile, the plain states and California will have continuing water difficulties moving forward. Long term, people are going to need to move to where there is abundant water. It is not sustainable for so many people to live in marginal areas.<p>One way to encourage people to move is by having market forces act. If the price of water is cheaper in the great lakes region there will be a slow but steady migration there over time. This will in turn ease the brewing crisis in the west. This isn&#x27;t the only action which should be taken but we should consider (from a policy perspective) the idea of allowing market forces to act in the water market.",1426269741

It would relieve an incredibly overloaded infrastructure. (If there was going to be nowhere to move those people, that would be a different problem, but that&#x27;s not the current problem. There are many places with enough water to drink.)<p>I mean, this is just the &quot;planetary carrying capacity&quot; issue applied to a smaller area. The argument still holds, so if you accept the idea that the planet has a certain carrying capacity for a certain level of lifestyle, the idea that maybe California can not support necessarily arbitrarily large numbers of people in a given lifestyle is just the same idea. Which idea is going to win out if they conflict?",1426269626

How high would prices hive to rise before the cost of water would cause people to literally go thirsty? Long before that point, people would cut down on showers, laundry, car washes, pools, and all the other uses of water, and prices would stabilize.<p>You say &quot;If a farm can&#x27;t afford water for crops, the crops weren&#x27;t profitable enough to grow anyway.&quot; From context, I gather you intended this to be ironic. But I don&#x27;t see why! That&#x27;s a totally true and justifiable statement. There&#x27;s plenty of farmland in wetter areas of the country to take up the slack. We won&#x27;t starve if we decide to stop subsidizing crops in inappropriate climates by providing artificially cheap water.",1426269619

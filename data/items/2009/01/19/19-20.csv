You will find a certain correlation between the size of a datastore and their interest in pursuing something other than an RDBMS.<p>This is not a coincidence. Nor are these people who just don't know about the holy doctrines of RDBMS and blunder on in ignorance, either. These are people who have had to <i>scale above</i> RDBMS.<p>They know what they are doing, and why they are doing it.",1232395175
440818,comment,439874,440153,0,0,richcollins,,,"> I always check to make sure a method roughly works, before moving on to the next one. Most of the time, this means either writing a unit test, or firing up the code and all of its dependencies, and clicking through it looking for bugs.<p>In my experience, well factored methods are correct 95% of the time.  When there is a bug you notice when you test things that exercise an entire host of methods at once.<p>> Also, and YMMV, I find writing code in a tests-first manner cuts my stress/frustration of coding by an order of magnitude. It greatly reduces the amount of context I have to keep in my head, so I'm not in the state where I can remember 90% of the information I need to effectively write this class.<p>Testing is not a good way to help with context.  A good debugger and well written code is.",1232395114

PG even asked people to refrain from doing this many down votes in a recent post. I am learning from my mistake of posting this, but I am relatively new to the forums. At the least I should be given some time to understand the requirements for posting (on this topic, I did find a forum rules page, but I had to Google it to find it, there were not obvious links from the forum afaik.)

I check every few days for new updates/info, and could care less about the fact that this module is where it is, etc.<p>The ""People You May Know"" module is hardly ""the problem"" with LinkedIn.  It's an experiment that works better for some people than for others, based solely on the 2 data point study here (I like it, you don't).<p>One of the things I like about LinkedIn is that they have done a good job keeping it more ""business"" than ""social"" oriented.

440796,comment,439874,440061,0,0,dasil003,,,"Also, it's important to remember that tests are code too.  A test needs to stand the test of time just as code does--if the tests are too brittle then you're just creating busy work.<p>However people who haven't tried methodologies like TDD or BDD shouldn't parrot this as justification for not writing tests.  First you need to learn how to write tests, and how to write more testable code.  Test-first is invaluable training for developing these skills.<p>Once you have that experience you are better qualified to decide what constitutes useful testing.  Frankly, I find the most value comes from basic sanity tests.  Testing obscure edge cases of algorithms is often times not worth it because the mistake is made once and corrected.  Having the test case is good (especially if written up front as an excercise in specification), but in many cases the chance that these things will break once fixed approaches 0.",1232393830

I.e. use democratic processes to agree on specific goals and how much resources to devote to these goals.  Like 'Reduce unemployment to at most 5%' using no more than 10^10 $.  Or 'Raise the literacy rate of people over 10 years to at least 99% in our nation.' for at most 5*10^9 $.<p>Then the government puts the allocated funds into escrow and auctions off zero-coupon bonds that pay off when the goal has been reached.  Of course the bond holders will do what they can to achieve the goal.  Or do something that makes the goal easier to reach, thus the price of the bonds rises and the original holder can sell them at a profit.<p>(The above is a description of Social Policy Bonds.)",1232393772

People working for great managers on things like search algorithms, Android or open source initiatives are much more likely to love their job. People working for managers they hate on things like Orkut, ATS, or cross-browser compatibility testing are much more likely to leave.<p>In a company as big as Google, different employees can have very different experiences. When you read this group set up for employees who quit, you're seeing the least happy segment of the employee population.

For a little theory: an RDBMS will store data and allow you to query it.  So, when you say, get me article #15, it scans through its index in approx. log(n) time and finds the row you're looking for, fetches the row and gives it back to you.  Memcached, on the other hand, will do hash(#15), grab that row.  That's all done in O(1) time and so it's a lot more scalable.  However, with an RDBMS you can say something like, ""get me the articles written in the past month"" and you can't do that with memcached.  Memcached allows key lookups only.<p>A lot of it is a tradeoff between scalability and convenience and using the right tool for the job.",1232393280

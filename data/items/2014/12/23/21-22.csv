You can always write original work that doesn&#x27;t depend on existing cultural references, and the ability to reference things is not as limited as you suggest. I can write an publish a book tomorrow in which a character reads a Harry Potter novel and muses on the content. What I can&#x27;t do is write a book featuring Harry Potter, boy wizard, as a character, unless it&#x27;s some sort of parody - but in that case I may well have to expend money and legal effort on defending against a lawsuit while a court decides whether the derivative work falls within some permissible exception.<p>Incidentally JRR Tolkien died in 1973 so you&#x27;ll be able to recycle characters from <i>Lord of the Rings</i> to your heart&#x27;s content in 29 years as long as the law doesn&#x27;t change; you just won&#x27;t be able to use the footage from the movies or quote the script insofar as it differs from the novel.

James Bond can thus be trademarked, in the same way that Harry Potter, Frodo Baggins, Sherlock Holmes, et al are trademarked.<p>But the name is only protected in the sense that it is attached to the character.  The character has to be distinct and unique, not a trope or stereotype character (except, obviously, the prototype character).  And the character has to be integral to a copyrighted story.  The courts are far from agreed on this standard, obviously, so that&#x27;s as much as I can say about it.<p>And it isn&#x27;t really even a full trademark.  It&#x27;s more like an artificial &quot;name and likeness&quot; right of publicity.  <i>Those rights vary by state</i>.  That creates some interesting scenarios.<p>Say, for instance, that author E.R.R. Fartin kills beloved serial character Guy Trademarked.  Some states define personality rights such that they terminate relative to the year of the person&#x27;s death.

8790413,comment,8788311,8790156,0,0,hagmonk,,,"Yes, the candidate should know in advance if there is a particularly structured interview technique being used, for sure.<p>Because it also requires a lot of mental commitment from the interview team as we&#x27;ll as the candidate, I&#x27;d recommend using this technique as the final hurdle. I don&#x27;t think you want to phone screen someone, then just toss them into this process. You need to have them cross some basic technical gate (like FizzBuzz, a take-home coding project, whatever), and have them meet a handful of people first, just to make sure they pass those early smoke tests.<p>In fact I think this technique works best when you want to seal the deal with a very strong candidate who is entertaining several options. Interviews should always be a two-way process, and if a candidate walks away from your interviews thinking &quot;I had real trouble getting my point across to those people, I would never work there&quot; then that represents <i>success</i> for the interview process.<p>The strongest candidates tend to be the ones least influenced by money and more interested in the problems, the people they will be working with, the culture and the environment of the organization. So having your interview process structured around revealing that gives you the best possible chance of matching your team with people excited to be there.<p>Conversely if you&#x27;re a candidate, even if the company you&#x27;re applying with doesn&#x27;t seem to have thought too deeply about this stuff, don&#x27;t despair. Hiring is one of the hardest things to do and also tends to be done by the seat of the pants (Amazon seems like a notable exception) <i>You</i> can impose your own structure by asking the right questions and making special requests of the recruiter. Tell them you want a chance to write code with someone! Or that you want to mock up a UI that solves a problem they have. Or you want to see what their strongest engineer thinks of your design for this service you&#x27;ve put together.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re desperate for the job, or whether you wish they&#x27;d stop calling you ... this kind of stuff makes you stand out in the crowd as proactive and motivated by the right reasons.",1419371252

Up until now the Sony/NK thing has been confusing from a technical standpoint - there&#x27;s lots of good reasons to be curious about and skeptical whether NK had anything to do with the SONY hack (see the bazillion threads on HN and elsewhere that cover it). Now for some conspiracy.<p>Here are some facts. One of the primary journalists responsible for announcing that the government had determined NK was responsible for the SONY hack is the same one responsible for falsely declaring the US had confirmed locations of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq on behalf of the State Department (Judith Miller), who hadn&#x27;t yet gotten the public support it needed to go into Iraq.<p>But what could the US&#x27;s motivation for falsely fingering North Korea in this attack, if that&#x27;s in fact what was done?<p>First, either instability or regime collapse in North Korea would mean very good things for the United States. Not just because it would advance human rights or because NK represents a black mark on US military operations. But also because instability threatens China. A regime collapse would mean China would have to deal with a flood of millions of starving and brainwashed immigrants at its border, and in fighting due to power vacuums. The downside is that the US would need to spend a lot of money and man hours supporting their ally South Korea, as they would also be forced to handle the instability, and because of US military presence in the region.<p>But second - and this is where the conspiracy theorizing comes in - we&#x27;ve seen the US make several attempts to get Twitter to censor certain types of information. The US, through the NSF, wants to study &#x27;social pollution&#x27; on Twitter (<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/truthy-project-is-unworthy-of-tax-dollars/2014/10/17/a3274faa-531b-11e4-809b-8cc0a295c773_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/truthy-project-is-unw...</a>). However, it already has studies on social contagion and memetic social influence and these are used in political campaigns today (<a href=""http://enga.ge/download/Inside%20the%20Cave.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://enga.ge/download/Inside%20the%20Cave.pdf</a> & <a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/how-obamas-internet-campaign-changed-politics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/how-obamas-internet...</a> & <a href=""http://theweek.com/article/index/256160/how-obama-won-the-internet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theweek.com/article/index/256160/how-obama-won-the-in...</a>). Moreover, the United States uses these tactics to influence public opinion in enemy nation states, such as the use of Twitter this year to cause insurrection and organize riots to overthrow the Cuban government earlier this year (search Cuban Twitter CIA), the use of Twitter messages in Jordan, Egypt, Syria and others to spread US propaganda (<a href=""http://minerva.dtic.mil/doc/samplewp-Lieberman.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minerva.dtic.mil/doc/samplewp-Lieberman.pdf</a>), and the US contracts with companies that are used to do the same thing (e.g. www.marayamedia.com).<p>The conspiracy here would be that since the US has so far lacked legal traction in giving it the ability to influence other nations with adversarial messages but preventing others from influencing US citizens in the same way, that it is using the traction of the NK/SONY event to create a civil law precedent for content curation in Twitter that can later be expanded to federal law. This creep from civil to federal law has happened before - notably with Youtube - which now removes content that the federal government wants it to (known examples include ISIL recruitment videos and US citizen Anwar al-Awlaki&#x27;s political messages).",1419369988

You have to reason about these things at some level, and what I hear people advocate on hn is to sidestep it all by preventing sharing, which may be a fine idea but doesn&#x27;t work for everything.<p>Lastly, in my mind, if your lock free algorithm works by letting the races happen but using the result of an atomic op and/or fences to ensure consistent behavior, I would still call that a (benign) race.

Set the base copyright term for that genre to be the 80th percentile of that number.<p>So you might see that 80% of fiction novels earn 80% of their revenues within 10 years or less (invented numbers).  If that were the case, set the default free copyright term to 10 years.  Obviously, some outliers will be late bloomers, so perhaps you make a reasonable accommodation for those by granting renewals that each last 5 years, for a flat fee plus a modest percentage of the earned revenue, which then increases with every renewal.<p>That would work just fine for the stated purpose of promoting the useful arts.  But I suspect that copyright is now also being used for the purpose of eliminating same-owner competition from older works.  For instance, why watch the newest Disney animated film when you could watch any of them older than N years?  Why play Gameseries 7 when you could also play Gameseries 1 through 6?  So perhaps also add a &quot;quashing and abandonment&quot; clause, wherein if the owner refuses or is unable to license or sell copies for N years, the work enters the public domain.<p>Given those reasonable ideas, I think maybe the founders were just guessing, and they probably didn&#x27;t guess correctly for 2014.",1419369201

For example, among young infants, females are more interested in faces and people, while males are more interested in mechanical objects. I believe a study showed this effect was present & statistically significant only a short time after birth (too soon to be influenced by culture).<p>There are well-known differences in brain structure, such as the portions of brain used for language. Women have an edge in verbal reasoning, while men in spatial.<p>Male IQ has more variability than female IQ, resulting in more men in both the top and bottom percentiles. This may explain why more men are executives, and why more men are homeless (that&#x27;s just my suspicion). Studies have also found that male IQ is higher on average by (variously) 3-5 points. From my personal observations, men are more likely than women to focus intensively on one activity, to the exclusion of all others, like skateboarding, or surfing, or computer programming, or gaming.<p>Men weigh more than women, have more muscle mass, have 40-60% more upper body strength, and 25-30% lower body strength, though with training the gap narrows to 0-8% (so perhaps this difference is more cultural). Men outperform women in most athletic areas, though perhaps not in distance running. Women live years longer than men and have lower rates of mental illness.<p>Women and men earn equal pay when you control for the job worked, the hours worked, and the amount of experience. I believe a study showed that single male and female professionals with no dependents, equal time in the workforce, working equal hours, earned equal amounts. The pay gap arises because slightly fewer women work high-paying jobs, they work fewer hours per week / take more time off, and drop out of the workforce at higher rates (e.g. stay at home parent).<p>A good summary of research and sources are available in Wikipedia articles like &quot;Sex differences in intelligence&quot; and &quot;Sex differences in psychology&quot;.

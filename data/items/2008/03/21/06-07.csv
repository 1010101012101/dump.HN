142286,comment,142285,142285,0,0,neilk,,,"I agree with Paul Graham's recent post on how large companies restrict freedom. His model of how it happens is interesting: as orders flow downwards through the tree, freedom is partitioned at every node. But does it follow that large companies must have this flaw? Only if you assume that management's job is to send orders downwards.<p>Google has tried to create a culture where management nurtures initiatives from below, to notable success. But this is only for engineers and only some of the time. The carrot they dangle is that you'll get to control 20% of your time at work. One-fifth!<p>Semco, described in the link, weeds out command-and-control wherever and whenever it crops up in the organization, and replaces it with free choice and shared self-interest.<p>And have you ever heard of a large company that has no IT policies whatsoever, other than <i>protecting worker email privacy</i>?<p><a href=""http://www.cioinsight.com/c/a/Expert-Voices/Ricardo-Semler-Set-Them-Free/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cioinsight.com/c/a/Expert-Voices/Ricardo-Semler-S...</a>",1206080684

142284,comment,141898,141917,0,0,eddiepunchclock,,,"yet another 27 year old programmer hear.  i've worked for google for the past 3 years.  after saving up a bunch of money and working with a lot of very smart people on two very different projects, I'd have to say I'm happy I chose to work for a company :)  That said, there is no substitute for being able to do exactly what you want.  I get my kicks in that regard programming on my own (reading SICP, toying with scala, etc).  But guess what, at a good company, so does everyone else.  My smart co-workers all have interests in and out of work, and just being around them and talking to them day in and day out (while eating really good free food) is a great way to learn a lot and get pointers to places to start learning more on your own.  We're not all brain dead code monkeys, believe it or not.<p>Ultimately though, the money I've saved will afford me the opportunity to strike out on my own.  I certainly don't knock small companies, or starting your own.  I just think large companies (OK, at least google) can be a great way to start your career before moving on to other stuff.",1206080535

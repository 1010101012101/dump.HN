Congrats to the author for such clean code base too!<p>Maybe slightly off topic, but one of the most important takeaways from this: you don&#x27;t need a bulky JavaScript framework to build complex applications. In fact, you may be better off without using one.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a very narrow sweet spot where a given JavaScript framework can make you more productive. But if your application is complex enough, like this editor, the framework will probably work against you. And if it is simple enough, it may be better to not use the framework, so you don&#x27;t grow dependent on it and find it hard to remove it if you need to grow the app.<p>Instead of the framework imposing the structure and constraints, a team can decide on the structure, agree on the constraints, and build libraries helpers according to that. Way more economic than the alternative: working around buggy and/or undocumented framework features, trying to catch up to constant changes and &quot;upgrades&quot;, fighting against the JavaScript marketing machinery trying to decide which of the &quot;Top JS Frameworks&quot; to use, etc.",1439012471

And it seems with all the premade building blocks (Arduino shields and such) fewer people would actually need to design from scratch. Also our idea of what&#x27;s &quot;interesting&quot; has shifted a bit... the radio receiver and burglar alarm and amplifier kits I built as a kid (in the 90&#x27;s) might not be be as exciting today.

10026434,comment,10024519,10024973,0,0,rquantz,,,"This comment was clearly made by someone who has never practiced art or music at a high level. You are trying to compare your experience as a musician with someone who has worked toward and dreamed of being one of the best there ever was since some time in, most likely, early adolescence.<p>I was among the best in my year on my instrument in the country. I went to one of the top music schools in the world, and then I moved to New York to keep studying and start working as a musician. Some time in the middle of the financial crisis, I got tired of being broke all the time, and of constantly battling injuries (that&#x27;s thing you&#x27;ve probably never had to worry about, as an amateur musician. Your arm is sore? You get to take a few days off!), and teaching music to the spoiled children of the masters of the universe. I learned to code and started working as a programmer.<p>Everyone who has ever been among the best, but didn&#x27;t quite make it, has to, at some point, decide they didn&#x27;t make it, and quit. Once I quit, I barely touched my instrument for two years. Playing when you&#x27;re out of practice can be pretty painful to someone who is highly trained. You&#x27;ve worked for years toward perfection and then you just have to start accepting... less than that.<p>Here&#x27;s another thing that happens when you quit: you have a constant voice in the back of your mind wondering whether you gave up too easily. You were there with the best people in the world, and now you watch them take their place among the leading lights of the art, and you can&#x27;t stop picturing yourself among them. It&#x27;s not whining, it&#x27;s the painful experience of giving up your lifelong image of yourself. Being a musician, a top level, professional musician, dominates your whole identity. Try to imagine this: rather than finding out at an early age that you&#x27;re not the next Jimmy Page, you get very good very quickly at a young age, and people start telling you, hey, you could be the next Jimmy Page. You work for decades to get good enough, sacrificing your personal relationships, your childhood, choosing over and over again to stay in and work instead of doing whatever else you could be doing, and then at age 30 after years of near misses and barely scraping by, you realize you&#x27;re just not the next Jimmy Page. It&#x27;s not an early realization, it&#x27;s a gradual defeat. And it&#x27;s devastating.<p>Regarding imposter syndrome, there have been studies of musicians using the standard &quot;sandwich method&quot; of delivering criticism, in which the criticism is sandwiched between two compliments. Trained musicians often don&#x27;t hear or register the compliments at all. I had this experience with my girlfriend recently. She played some excerpts for me, I said, &quot;wow you sound great, I liked X and Y. Here are a few things you should work on.&quot; She asked me later if I thought she was complete shit. I said, &quot;I said you sounded great,&quot; and she said &quot;You did?&quot; She literally had not even heard me say I thought she sounded great.<p>Here&#x27;s another fact about the music world. People are often loath to tell you that you don&#x27;t sound good (or don&#x27;t sound great). Musicians know this, and so every time someone tells you that performance was great, there&#x27;s a little part of you that wonders if you&#x27;re being lied to. Often you&#x27;ll get hired by a contractor to play a gig, and then never get called by them again. Sometimes that&#x27;s because they have their regular people and you were just a stand in, or because they died or moved or whatever. Other times it&#x27;s because they didn&#x27;t like your playing. But they never tell you which one it is. So every time you don&#x27;t get called back for a gig, regardless of what the actual reason is, there&#x27;s a chance it&#x27;s because you weren&#x27;t good enough. Feedback is not consistent and it is not reliable.<p>So given those two facts, is it a wonder musicians can suffer from imposter syndrome? It&#x27;s not a question of, &quot;people will realize I can&#x27;t play guitar,&quot; it&#x27;s the very fine line between being very very good, and being great. Regardless of which side of the line you&#x27;re on, you&#x27;re always wondering.<p>Does that clear things up?",1439011341

For one, if China let the internet be completely open, much of the young population could potentially flock to already mature websites and China wouldn&#x27;t have much of a chance to develop their own web ecosystem before loosing the market to the west. They seem to be controlling for the fact that the US got massive a head start by isolating their web and forcing domestic innovation.<p>As for police in web companies, this is terrible from a western point of view, but there are a lot of things western people don&#x27;t understand about Chinese society: China has a very large population of people without formal education. During the cultural revolution there were only around 47,000 people in college. Combine that with a cultural tendency of Chinese people to organize in large groups and you have a massive populace vulnerable to influence from cults, pyramid schemes, fraud, and dangerous mobs. I saw a lot of this when I lived there, my wife&#x27;s cousin even lost his mind after being brainwashed by a weird fraud/pyramid scheme group. Also when there is a mob in China it&#x27;s sometimes so big that nothing short of the military can stop it, so naturally the govt. would want be proactive about preventing these things. So we have free speech in the US but we also have to deal with anti-vaccers, can you imagine if an anti-vaccine group took hold in a place as populated as China? Again, I don&#x27;t like what China is doing, and perhaps I&#x27;m being too optimistic about their intentions, but after studying China for about a decade I can kind of see where they are coming from with this kind of thing.",1439011161

10026422,comment,10020827,10023312,0,0,bjterry,,,"This article reminds me of one of my all-time favorite articles. Quantity Always Trumps Quality by Jeff Atwood [1]. There is a bunch of commentary on it on Less Wrong [2], some of which is interesting. Also an interesting parallel to a Paul Graham post [3]:<p>> I was taught in college that one ought to figure out a program completely on paper before even going near a computer. I found that I did not program this way. I found that I liked to program sitting in front of a computer, not a piece of paper. Worse still, instead of patiently writing out a complete program and assuring myself it was correct, I tended to just spew out code that was hopelessly broken, and gradually beat it into shape. Debugging, I was taught, was a kind of final pass where you caught typos and oversights. The way I worked, it seemed like programming consisted of debugging.<p>> For a long time I felt bad about this, just as I once felt bad that I didn&#x27;t hold my pencil the way they taught me to in elementary school. If I had only looked over at the other makers, the painters or the architects, I would have realized that there was a name for what I was doing: sketching. As far as I can tell, the way they taught me to program in college was all wrong. You should figure out programs as you&#x27;re writing them, just as writers and painters and architects do.<p>1: <a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/quantity-always-trumps-quality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codinghorror.com/quantity-always-trumps-quality/</a><p>2: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/53e/just_try_it_quantity_trumps_quality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/53e/just_try_it_quantity_trumps_qual...</a><p>3: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html</a>",1439011081

If this does succeed though, I can only imagine it will make cracking all forms of DRM more prominent. And there is my conundrum. Coming from the content owner world as a musician, I don&#x27;t think there is anything wrong with guarding your copyrighted media content; as it is different in scope from software used in, say, medical devices that affect peoples lives. So I think what should happen instead is along the lines of a specific exemption for security research in software/hardware and not so much a blunt legalization of all DRM hacking.<p>But then again, whether DRM inhibits piracy or just creates access annoyances is another topic altogether. I&#x27;ve admired O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s no DRM model for their ebooks, but I don&#x27;t think that model would work with the non-professional and not as deeply committed audience that, say, consumers of pop music in their teens would be.",1439011033

As a member of a startup, it is generally in your best interest to assume that the complainant is right and your code is wrong.<p>Assume that your code is wrong. Investigate it.

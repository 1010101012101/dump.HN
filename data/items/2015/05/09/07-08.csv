9515789,comment,9515125,9515714,0,0,pdkl95,,,"> Only a small part of systemd runs as PID 1. Systemd is not a monolith, it is a bunch of various utilities.<p>Ahh, there&#x27;s the talking point I mentioned in my earlier post[1].<p>What you&#x27;re not understanding is that when we describe something as &quot;monolithic&quot; (or &quot;modular&quot;) we&#x27;re talking about if the design[2], not the number of binaries it happens to compile into. This is about minimizing complexity, and the way to do that is to break the problem into small pieces, while clearly and rigorously defining the interconnections between those pieces (an area that necessarily involves higher complexity).<p>As an example in the opposite direction, consider busybox. While it compiles into a single binary, the <i>features</i> provided by busybox are very modular. You could remove any of the utilities it can emulate without that change cascading into lots of other unrelated features (with build system support), and I could replace any of the utilities with something else (i.e. the standard non-busybox version) by simply removing a symlink.<p>Systemd is designed in the opposite manner, on purpose. They put every but of code the project absorbs into the same repository, claiming it makes development easier. Of course it does... initially; you get to skip the all those clearly and rigorously defined interfaces.  They can seem like unnecessary work in the beginning, but it is going to be hell maintaining that mess of code in the long run.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9515413"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9515413</a><p>[2] See the &quot;Rule of Modularity&quot;: <a href=""http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html#id2877537"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html#id2...</a>",1431156414

Do I think that it is conducive to the goal of acquiring the problem-solving skills to hack something together? Maybe, maybe not.<p>One of the challenges that a novice developer needs to face and overcome more or less independently is the challenge of making sense of something that looks totally foreign <i>with minimal guidance</i>, and figuring out how this new piece of software fits within their understanding of computing as a whole. This independent contextualization allows the budding developer to know when it is appropriate to use a new tool, whether or not a tool does its job (and how well), and what to watch out for in order to avoid bugs in dependent software.<p>Another crucial thing to being a good programmer is learning how to teach yourself. If a would-be developer goes out, gets a CS degree, and stops learning thereafter, they might as well be frozen in the year in which they graduated. New tools come out all the time, and it&#x27;s important to know how to sift through documentation (rather than relying solely on tutorials), how to find good explanations of new concepts, and how to get questions answered without necessarily having a buddy or professor on hand who can definitively resolve the issue for you.<p>I think that your idea would be really helpful to organize the especially good resources on certain topics by increasing difficulty, but at the same time, I think that it could be a bit of a crutch.

Chile being very start-up and generally business-friendly, which does indeed involve government staying out of wealth creators&#x27; way, and setting up a couple of programs like Startup Chile. Setting up a new company in Chile can be done in a couple of days now, and much of it online.<p>Peru is following in Chile&#x27;s footsteps and has had amazing growth for the last 20 years as a result of a radical reforming of government in the 90s, precisely to kill stifling bureaucracy and red tape.  Where there was 50% poverty in the mid-90s, there is now about 20%.  Even remote farmers are online via their smartphones, and now know what to grow, when to grow it, how to grow it, where to sell it, etc. Tech and free markets have substantially improved people&#x27;s lives, to the point that anyone who visited around the year 2000 would just not recognise the place today.<p>It&#x27;s clear to me that free markets work, and that Chile and Peru are living proof of it.  Sure, it&#x27;s not first world levels yet, but both countries are certainly getting there at turbo speed.  Anyone who doubts this should look at the number of highly qualified migrants going not from Chile and Peru to Spain, but in the other direction: from Spain to Chile and Peru.  They see it as a place of opportunity where the old and sclerotic welfare systems of Europe have let them down.",1431155668

Things like ts_headline (not shown), or meta->>&#x27;title&#x27; (shown) should only be performed for the few rows you actually are retrieving and you should make the data you pass around be as small as possible at all points.<p>Note that you don&#x27;t need to call plainto_tsquery twice, you can use the one you&#x27;ve already declared.<p>And I notice you are returning the JSON document whole, have you checked whether it&#x27;s faster to extract the title here or later in whatever your programming language is?<p>The giveaway clue in your post btw is this: &quot;We experimented with returning the document text with results and found that if we returned the full text of documents, it added about 350ms to the query time which seems to be network overhead rather than a slower query.&quot;.<p>As soon as you notice a linear slowdown, when you&#x27;re only returning 5 rows whatever happens... then internally you must be doing something in the query that relates to <i>all</i> rows.<p>PostgreSQL fulltext scales nicely, I use it on a platform driving over 300 web sites with 10s of millions of comments. I originally used it thinking it will buy me time before I have to add a dedicated search engine, and it helps now as I store permissions knowledge in the database too... but truth is, it&#x27;s just not been an issue yet. I&#x27;m not needing to consider anything else as it&#x27;s performing great. The slowest part of my query isn&#x27;t fulltext search, it&#x27;s my permissions stuff (because I&#x27;ve gone down the rabbit hole of users, groups, roles, etc and this is calculated for all content), but still the 95th percentile for searches is typically under 10ms.",1431155218

I can go through all of codecademy and LPTHW but I can&#x27;t figure out something this simple!? Damn it. In my head this is how I would solve it:<p>First you need to grab user input and store it\nNext you need to define what consonants are and create a list\nIf user input contains any of the letters defined in the list (regardless of case) place an &#x27;o&#x27; after the specific letter and add the consonant\nReturn to above command and check for any other characters, once every character is checked return new output and exit.<p>---<p>But for some reason I just hit a blank wall and can&#x27;t apply this to python, it&#x27;s as if I learn the syntax but not problem solving, or its like I haven&#x27;t really learned programming.

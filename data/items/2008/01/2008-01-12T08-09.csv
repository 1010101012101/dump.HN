Last time I looked, they did not have javascript yet.<p>Also, I think in Spring you can create configurations in a programmatic way, if you want to, you are not forced to use xml.",1200127993

That it is dying has little to do with the language itself, but rather it's a product of the fact that no current programming language can create architecture that truly scales and maintains exceptions  to its abstraction mechanisms without breaking.<p>Alan Kay said it best, ""Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves.""<p>So what happens when you build a dog house out of cardboard and tape?  Nothing.  It works great.  But build a house of that and it will be constantly falling apart.<p>What's happening now is that, after ten years, these systems have become so complex that they're not maintainable.  People are noticing that their houses are falling apart.  So they switch materials and start from the ground up and everything looks great at first, and the cycle starts again.",1200127419

97494,comment,97128,97252,0,0,davidw,,,"Tests are obviously an important part of software development.  The first thing I wrote once I got Hecl running was a simple test suite.  However... I got it running first - I played around, I tried a few things, then I sat down and wrote the code that defined how it should be.  When adding new features, sometimes I know exactly what should happen, so I'll write a test.  Other times, I don't know how it should work, and need to experiment some, to see how different things would work out in practice.  In those cases writing tests first is a waste of time.",1200127144

The Hacker News Suggestions link could also go there, tacitly encouraging people such as myself to post new suggestions there, rather the main forum.",1200126907

If that other number is 180 for YC, and 1,000,000,000 for Slashdot, YC is worse than Slashdot.<p>I like the concept though... measuring a site's godwin factor.",1200126727

Witness the demise of Shake and Silicon Grail, both top notch compositing packages for Irix, Windows and Linux. Jobs bought them both, jammed them into a forced marriage and told them that their stuff could only run on Apples. People in the effects industry stayed away in droves (because of the Mac as dongle thing), which finally led to Apple fire-saling the Shake source code and killing the product. _That_ sure worked out well.<p>Now the only professional compositing option for Windows and Linux is Eyeon Fusion. Not a bad program, but the only one left standing thanks to Apple's actions. I suppose that if Apple buys Adobe, makes everything but Flash players Mac only, then Corel can finally make a comeback...? ;-)",1200126380

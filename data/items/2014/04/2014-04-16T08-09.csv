7596744,comment,7595400,7595400,3,0,andolanra,,,"I&#x27;m being a bit pedantic, but the last snippet under <i>About lambda and closures-in-a-loop pitfall</i> is arguably misleading when it says, &quot;This, however, does not apply to generators…&quot; Which is true in the example given, but not true <i>in general</i>. Generators don&#x27;t actually provide a new environment on each evaluation, they just lazily construct their contents, which assuages the problem in certain situations. This snippet<p><pre><code>    for l in (lambda: n for n in range(3)):\n        print(l()) # prints 0, 1, 2\n</code></pre>\nwill alternately request an argument from the generator, return a lambda, call it, and <i>only then</i> request the next argument from the generator, which means at the time of the funtion call, <i>n</i> will not have been incremented up to its final value. We can see the previous closures-in-a-loop behavior return if we keep the closures around to execute again, at which point the loop environment contains the final value of <i>n</i>:<p><pre><code>    funcs = []\n    for x in (lambda: n for n in range(3)):\n        funcs.append(x)\n        print(x()) # prints 0, 1, 2\n    for y in funcs:\n        print(y()) # prints 2, 2, 2\n</code></pre>\nSo generators don&#x27;t &#x27;fix&#x27; the problem by constructing distinct environments for each loop iteration, but by deferring evaluation of their body until necessary.",1397638567

7596729,comment,7594393,7594393,3,0,oleganza,,,"Right now nodes do not accept double spending transactions, no matter how much they pay in mining fees. This makes simple security promise for 0-conf transactions: the most relayed version is the one that most probably will be included in the block. So merchants can accept such transactions because they know that reversing it would cost much more than 100% of the transaction value.<p>If enough nodes on the network replace transactions when the mining fee is, say, 10% higher than the previous version (or 10% of the total amount, or whatever), then for the user it is much cheaper to “take money back”. You will send $5 for your coffee and get back $4 with no sweat. Merchant will lose all $5. You can say goodbye to 0-confirmation transactions.<p>So what do we have:<p>1) Users get some sort of “undo” function which is nobody was asking for. In my view, if there’s a problem with accidental button clicking in the UI, it’s simpler to fix right there, not by changing the entire network.<p>2) No one can rely on 0-confirmation transactions anymore. Even today they are not safe, but for small purchases the risks are pretty low, so they work for many people to everyone’s satisfaction. But with network-wide “replace with higher-fee transaction” the risk will go up significantly to make this feature unusable.<p>However, in the long run, 0-conf transactions won’t be the future of instant micropayments (we’ll have some sort of distributed clearing network instead), so we might not care that much. But the value of “undo” is still very questionable to throw away usefulness of 0-conf transactions today.<p>Final note: Bitundo can’t be useful when it’s small. It’s either working more than 90% of the time for legitimate “undos” (which makes 0-conf txs useless) or it’s used marginally only by those who wish to rob merchants who accept 0-conf transactions. In which case they still may render 0-conf transactions useless.",1397638182

Now how about some more highly technical jacquesm classics? :)<p>Not sure I&#x27;m getting you about the caveat, unless you mean that we shouldn&#x27;t penalize any threads. If we didn&#x27;t do that, the front page would be overrun with low-quality controversies and shouting matches: in davidw&#x27;s words, &quot;articles that get you riled up, but really don&#x27;t lead to any productive or interesting discussions&quot;. [1]<p>So there&#x27;s editorial judgment involved. There always has been. HN has always been a blend of voting and curation.<p>What I&#x27;m saying above is that we exercise that editorial judgment <i>less</i>, not more, when YC-startup-related controversies crop up—precisely because we don&#x27;t want to be accused of censorship for venal purposes. Of course people accuse us of precisely that anyway, but that goes with the territory. I don&#x27;t expect not to get acccused; I do want to be able to reply in good conscience.<p>Two more caveats for you. I&#x27;m not saying there aren&#x27;t unconscious biases—that would be foolish—just that we consciously try hard to guard against them. I&#x27;m also not saying that every bad story about YC gets a free pass to the front page. The bar may be lower, but it still exists. When articles come up that are just plain terrible, we don&#x27;t, in Mrs. Thatcher&#x27;s immortal words, go wobbly.<p>The &quot;Drop Dropbox&quot; story you cite is an example of all this. I initially penalized it. Why? Because it&#x27;s a classic specimen of the riler-uppers davidw was talking about. The penalty made it go from #1 to the lower part of the front page. However, I forgot that Dropbox was a YC company (perhaps they&#x27;re so big that I don&#x27;t think of them as a startup any more). When someone reminded me of that, my first thought was that we needed to lighten the penalty and I immediately went and did so. That made the post go to #9. From then on, we didn&#x27;t touch it at all [2]. The reason it fell from there was because, as incredibly many votes as it got, it got even more incredibly many flags. I just wrote some code to scan the last million posts to HN and sort them by flaggedness. That post is the most flagged by far; it has 3x as many flags as the next. (In the same data set, it is the third most upvoted story and has 11% more votes than the next.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7495446"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7495446</a><p>[2] Actually, we did. A moderator fat-finger later that evening caused several things to happen, one of which was killing that story. I saw that in the moderation log and immediately reversed it, along with all the other effects of the fat-finger. I think the story was in that killed state for a couple hours. And now you have a complete dump of my memory about &quot;Drop Dropbox&quot;. For the love of God or at least Mrs. Thatcher, please, no more &quot;examples&quot; tonight!<p>(Also, once Kevin&#x27;s mobile-friendly markup is out, there should be no more moderator fat-fingers.)<p>Edit the morning after: I hasten to add that my Thatcher references were merely an attempt at a joke, not an oblique political statement.",1397637946

Second The point of companies returning monies to share holders, is to simplify tax/business structures.  The income given to shareholders as profit is then taxed at 50%.. not favoring anyone.. it&#x27;s a straight across the board flat tax + basic income for every adult.<p>I&#x27;m in favor of a much simplified structure, applied evenly, as fairly as possible, and much smaller government needed to operate it.  A <i>lot</i> of spending comes down to complicated bureaucracies, reducing those is a big step.  Another benefit of a basic income, is it would allow the revocation of a lot of welfare and stimulus programs, and their own layers of corruption and bureaucracy.<p>I&#x27;m also in favor of cutting the overall defense and operations budgets by at least 2/3 ...  There&#x27;s a lot of ways the federal government could be much more effective, and reduce expenditures at the same time.<p>And although I don&#x27;t know how much I feel it is the government&#x27;s place, a baseline healthcare system could even be funded in a much better way than Obamacare.  I tend to lean libertarian, but I&#x27;m a pragmatist.  I just want solutions that are responsible, and have a chance at making things better, while avoiding as much chance for corruption and bureaucracy as possible.

If anyone knows the flaws of your product, it&#x27;s the guys and gals on the front lines that have to make excuses for it every day.<p><i>>A support rep can only go so far.

If anyone knows how screwed up a process is in your organization, or how broken your product is, it&#x27;s the poor saps like us that are tasked with carrying those processes out and supporting those crappy products. Support agents don&#x27;t lack &quot;visibility.&quot; They lack authority and autonomy to handle issues on their own without fear of reprisal for not using the proper openers and closers and not keeping all calls under 12 minutes so they hit that magic 5 calls and 10 chats an hour marker.

We get paid the same amount no matter how easy or rough the day was, no matter how &quot;above and beyond&quot; we went.

Or it could just be justification for denying a raise or promotion.<p>===================================<p>Overall, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll really get the experience you&#x27;re looking for as a CEO.

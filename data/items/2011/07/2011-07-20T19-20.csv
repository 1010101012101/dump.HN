If you have a look at DMR's description of why the pipe was invented, it suddenly clicks.<p>All of these tools are intended to be composable, analogous to functions.  'cat -v' is like a function with too many arguments, one that does too much.  If you need, for example, to allocate a block of zero'd memory, you don't add new flags to malloc(); you use memset() after allocation, you write a for loop, or you use calloc().<p>Likewise, the basic tools available on Unix can and should be thought of as functions, which take some number of arguments, and the implicit argument of an input channel.  They produce as their output an integer as a return value and two output channels, stdout and stderr.  Making a function that does too much (and this is as subjective for functions as it is for command-line tools) is known to be bad practice, but for the shell, it is often misunderstood.  To misunderstand this is to misunderstand the core principals of the Unix environment.<p>It has nothing to do with the typical non-programmer user.  On, say, Linux or OSX, the user doesn't write functions or talk to the shell very often.  They click buttons in a GUI that doesn't in a meaningful sense offer composable programs, and it's an inefficient but simple way to interact with the machine, a way that matches their habits and understanding.  cat, echo, sed, and awk aren't for these users; they're for programmers, and the typical user does not know or care whether cat can show non-printing characters, but as a programmer, I certainly care about a clean design for my environment.",1311191240

In development mode, it gets compiled anew on every page load.

Any company I've ever been a part of has had at least 3 environments (sandbox/qa/live) and it's very common to have a dev and staging environment on top of those as well.

I worked on JBox2d, a physics engine (which creates a ton of tiny Vec2 objects for intermediate steps in calculations), and for most of its history the highest ROI optimization has been to chip away at any and all unnecessary object creation; sometimes this meant inlining simple operations that would have created intermediate vectors or matrices (this can be a huge win because you both avoid GC load <i>and</i> object-size overhead, which for a cache-miss dominated application like a physics engine can be extremely important), sometimes it meant pre-allocating ""scratchpad"" objects, and so on, but the end result was that we got more than a 4x speed increase by focusing exclusively on getting rid of small object shenanigans.  Recently there was a rewrite which included some more explicit pooling strategies; I haven't tested those against the unpooled variants, but I should, I suspect there's still a huge benefit.  The additional bonus is that if you're careful about garbage it's a <i>lot</i> easier to use your code on Android or to push it through GWT, as those platforms don't have anywhere near the GC efficiency of the Sun JVM.<p>I don't know about ByteBuffers, though, we never experimented with those because we didn't want to mess around with any unsafe code that might not be allowed in applets or on other platforms.<p>Things like escape analysis and scalar replacement help, but not enough.  The problem is, those optimizations are extremely fragile, and for a lot of real world code the type of analysis required to figure out that those optimizations depends on knowledge of the overall design of the system (for instance, knowing that certain methods will not mutate fields of objects passed to them in certain situations).<p>Granted, a physics engine that's creating ~100,000 small objects per frame in some situations is an extreme edge case, and when I'm not doing that type of programming I'm much less concerned with garbage.",1311190052

The 'magic' in a good RAID6 implementation is what it does when things go wrong, and lots of things do go wrong. The checksumming is great too.<p>At some point you can dump the sheet metal on the 'pods', just build your own rack unit. If you look at the 'big iron' systems from NetApp, EMC, and others you will see they make one big enclosure then can install simpler systems within that enclosure. What this buys you is that you can distribute enclosure services into the big box and take it off the individual boxes. That gives you better cost efficiencies. And as you point out your system can run with fewer fans, so you can put a couple of largish three phase fans in the big enclosure (dead simple and very reliable) and use them to push the air through all the other boxes. (or pull it). Then add an android tablet for the 'door' of the enclosure that tells you drive status, etc and you're practically a player in the storage game :-)",1311188867

The performance benefits usually follow, but are not necessarily the goal. What happens (at least in MySQL) is that now you have three indecies instead of two: (id), (a_id, b_id) and (b_id, a_id). So, for a large table you are taking up more RAM than you need to, since the index is likely to be stored in RAM. Second, often times the DB will try to optimize lookups against primary keys by clustering the records that are close on the index tree to be close on your HDD. This can lead to increases in performance for large tables.

But having used both Splunk and SumoLogic, I personally think that Sumo is superior in many ways.<p>1. It requires very little hacking and setup to work (cough ELK cough Splunk) since Sumo is completely cloud-based. It literally takes 2 minutes to sign up, 5 minutes to download and configure some log collectors, then voila you&#x27;re ready to send data and search. Also I believe you can tell Sumo Logic to grab logs directly from S3 for example if you&#x27;re running everything on AWS.<p>2. SumoLogic is pretty easy to use (it&#x27;s basically cloud-based grep/awk) and has some really cool features that makes Splunk feel clunky in comparison. Parsing and transposing data for graphing is really simple. Also little things like auto-suggesting sources/hosts while you&#x27;re typing a query makes the experience much smoother than jumping around tabs copy/pasting shit.<p>3. If you start to generate a lot of logs, and I mean a metric fuckton of logs from 1000s of servers, Splunk Storm will most definitely not be able to help you. In-house Splunk / ELK clusters will need to be carefully sized (just google ELK sizing).<p>As software developers, we have enough on our plates that it really pays to use tools that help rather than make you wanna throw up your fists and curse.

I&#x27;d really like to be able to write-once-and-run-desktop-and-browser. I used to do C++, and now there is Emscripten, but I&#x27;d really rather not get back into C++ again.<p>I agree completely, about type safe, static types, and not wanting to get back to the mess of C++ (header files, makefiles, ifdefs, complexity, etc.).<p>Which is why I think Go fits the bill so well.<p>> Go looked interesting, and there seems to already be a fair amount of work towards transpiling to JS.<p>There is indeed.

It&#x27;s known as a &quot;work for hire&quot;.<p>This is generally not true in US copyright law. In US copyright law, a &quot;work made for hire&quot; is either made by an employee in the scope of employment, or is one of certain classes of commissioned for one of several specific purposes enumerated in the law where there is a written agreement signed by both parties specifically designating it as a work made for hire. If it is not done by an employee in the scope of employment, then if it is not also commissioned for one of the purposes explicitly described in the law or, even if it is, if there is not a written agreement designating it as a work made for hire, then its not a work made for hire.<p>Note that the purposes enumerated in the law include commissions:<p>* as a contribution to a collective work<p>* as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work<p>* as a translation<p>* as a supplementary work<p>* as a compilation<p>* as an instructional text<p>* as a test<p>* as answer material for a test<p>* as an atlas<p>...and that&#x27;s <i>it</i>. Most specially commissioned software won&#x27;t fit into one of those categories, so even <i>with</i> an explicit written agreement purporting to designate a work as one made for hire, it still won&#x27;t actually be a work made for hire for copyright purposes, and the copyright will rest with the creator. see 17 USC Secs. 101, 201.<p>> That&#x27;s what your customer will expect, anyway.<p>If your customers expect that, they will generally be wrong.<p>> I mean, would you pay someone to build a thing for you and think didn&#x27;t own the copyright on the thing?<p>To the extent that someone commissioning a work that is not in the categories that can be a work for hire in US law wants to own the copyright of a work created in the US, they should seek to recieve a signed transfer of copyright, otherwise they will be disappointed. see 17 USC Sec. 204.",1422762402

Numerical analysis is a whole branch of computer science which regularly deals with slight differences in computation. The usage of a constant (like pi) that is one bit different could cascade into massive differences in the results between the two programs.<p>Neither are completely wrong (as their results are similar) they just aren&#x27;t exactly the same, especially when dealing with 7 day forecasts, this isn&#x27;t to be entirely unexpected. We are trying to approximate massive systems we don&#x27;t fully understand.

A single instruction can&#x27;t, so if you design an instruction set to implement Chess and then don&#x27;t use it, that&#x27;s not really the point of the question.<p>Any ideas about how to better specify the rules of the competition to exclude degenerate answers like the one you provided?  The goal is to answer the interesting question.  You&#x27;d never find such a high-level instruction in a real instruction set, because it wouldn&#x27;t be useful except to play Chess.<p>I&#x27;d add a rule like &quot;The goal of your instruction set is to be useful while still implementing Chess,&quot; but then that would exclude answers which give interesting instruction sets that aren&#x27;t necessarily useful except in implementing Chess in the fewest possible bytes.<p>Thanks for pointing out the flaws in my ruleset.

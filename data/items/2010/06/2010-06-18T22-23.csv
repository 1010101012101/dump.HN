You've kinda explained how to use your service and what it does, but I don't know that I understand what a venue is going to get.<p>As a band (which I'm not) I suspect I'd like to see that.<p>I'm sure you know there has been a few attempts at this space, the most recent one I'm familiar with is <a href=""http://www.toursavant.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.toursavant.com/</a>.<p>In my research when I was looking into this space, I found that venues were wanted to work with local booking agents. The reason (they told me) is that they aren't in the business of promoting or choosing artist, it just isn't what their good at. That is what the local booking agent does. Of course, this depends on the venue a bit.<p>The big challenge that I think you are going to have is building the database of venues or booking agents.<p>Right now as I see it, bands can add themselves to your site, but there are very few venues that they can request to be promoted too.
I think that is the next challenge for you.<p>As far as the current site you've got, it's easy to navigate, and add venues, so you've so far managed that process well.<p>Your logo is quite pixelated, so I'd get that cleaned up a bit. I don't think you have to worry too much about the design at this stage. As long as it looks cool and professional(ish), i think you're good.<p>Best of luck",1276901974

1443732,comment,1443016,1443702,0,0,istjohn,,,"I just don't see jQuery as a grand interconnected topic deserving of ""book treatment."" It shouldn't be seen as something that requires one to read a book before you can start using it.  Just find the function that does what you want to do in the docs, read the description and example code, and use it.  Before long, you'll intuitively get the jQuery aesthetic.  There is no reason to try to master the theory before attempting to actually use jQuery.  There is no theory.  It's all very simple.<p>Now, on the other hand, if you don't yet know Javascript and you're trying to use jQuery, I would suggest learning the syntax and semantics of the language first.  But if you know Javascript, then jQuery is trivial.<p>In that respect, I think maybe the biggest value in this book is the Javascript overview at the beginning.  Too many people try to use jQuery without grasping its foundation.",1276901919

My landlord required 60 days notice, so after the premature ending of my last project, I'm on a lease for two months I don't need.  There are <i>tons</i> of people who have gaps between leases and need housing for the odd month or two, and there are tons stuck with ends of leases they don't want.  Landlords don't want to deal with that stuff because it's not cost effective for them to vet someone for less than 6 months.  Why couldn't an Internet company handle this?  Charge people an application fee of $35 or so, vet them like a landlord would, then let them into the lease scraps market.",1276901559

1443727,comment,1443036,1443323,0,0,mhd,,,"Heck, Windows looks more like OS X nowadays. And even in the mid-90s, Linux desktops wanted to look like Nextstep, so the Mac envy seems a logical succession (let's better forget the CDE phase).<p>But the whole design space is really, really small. You're mostly making a distinction by a subtly different look and some procedural differences. This is true for every desktop since the 80s, whether it's System 6, OS X, RISC OS, KDE, GNOME or WPS.<p>That is what the audience wants. The amount of developers isn't that influential anymore, and even they are most likely to use Windows 95/Nextstep style interfaces since they started out using computers. The old Unix greybeards (and their spiritual successors) populate a very small island with weird palm tress.<p>There still are about as many, if not more people who use their DE as a glorified terminal multiplexer (or Emacs life support). But for them, ""Linux on the Desktop"" never was an issue in the first place.<p>I seriously doubt that anything really new will come on the desktop. Everything that tried failed (mostly integrated systems like Oberon, Smalltalk, Plan 9) for the ""common user"", or got integrated in the normal desktop (web apps, terminal emulators). Everything new seems to happen on different devices (mostly mobile), and even there I don't see a different frontier, it's mostly a mash-up of traditional desktop GUIs and web apps, adjusted for the limitations on the devices.",1276901546
1443726,comment,1442016,1442016,0,0,wilhelm,,,"Let me tell you a bit about how this works on the other side of the fence. I'm 26, and for the past three years I've worked as department manager in a well-known Norwegian software company, responsible for hiring in my group. I've evaluated a thousand different candidates and hired about a dozen full-time employees from all over the world.<p>In the end, it doesn't matter who you are, where you're from or what education you have. The only things that matter are whether you're excellent at what you do, that you have proven that you're capable of getting stuff done and that you'd fit in with the rest of the team.<p>If you start your own business, none of this is relevant, of course. As long as you ship something a sufficient large number of people are willing to pay for, you're set.<p>But most people work for others, and you probably will too before you've gained a sufficient level of experience to do your own thing. To get a job in the industry, you'll have to prove all of the above, and sufficiently impress myself or my peers elsewhere in the industry to get your inside the door.<p>An education is a great asset to start with. That piece of paper proves that you have at least three years of experience working with relevant subjects. If you've spent your time well and got to know all the industrious people at your university, you might already know someone working where you're applying for a job. That often gets you to the interview.<p>But that piece of paper is far from enough. I need to see that you've done something with your life, that you've _created_ something. It doesn't matter if it's contributions to an open source project, running the servers of your student organization or building your own business on the side. Show me that you care, that you love what you're doing, that you're capable of getting stuff done. If the classes are easy, you'll have plenty of time to do other stuff I'm more impressed by.<p>But do not, under any circumstances, get crappy grades in subjects that are “too easy”. It is _not_ beneath you. You'll do boring and easy tasks even if you're a superstar, and that line of Cs on your transcript is a big, blinking warning sign I cannot ignore. If you don't care enough, you're better off without that piece of paper. Do your own thing, then, but you'll have to work twice as hard to prove yourself.<p>Not that it's impossible, of course. I have no education. Straight out of high school I applied for a five-week internship at my current company. I got good references from another employee, so I did get to the interview, and I did get the internship. And after eight days, I had a permanent job.<p>The pay was horrible, the work was - well, entry-level - but that was fine. As long as I could prove that I was great at what I was doing, I could advance. And so I did.<p>After two years I had the job I really wanted from the start. It was excellent. And after a few more months, I was promoted to be head of my department, despite being the youngest person on the team.<p>Three years later, my peers are finishing their degrees and applying for jobs. I'm very happy with my decisions so far in life, and think I've learned more this way than I would have done at a university. But I've had to work very hard to get here.",1276901474

It doesn't change that your fundamental carrot is being a valued member of a community. It gives an objective measurement of that, as opposed to reading (and potentially misinterpreting) what the community view of your contribution. Attaching the notion of a score is useful for manipulating behavior, but people aren't going to try for that high score unless it's associated with something they already find valuable. The karma system helps and reinforces the community aspect, but a karma system will not in and of itself grant quality of discourse.",1276901467

Here is a basic diagram of the different nodes in the RAN and CN and which layers they operate on:<p>UE<->NodeB (Uu): <your data> | PDCP | RLC | MAC | <L1 radio stuff><p>NodeB<->RNC (Iub): <your data> | PDCP | RLC | MAC | FP | <L2 stuff depending on IP/ATM/etc><p>RNC <-> SGSN (Iu): <your data> | GTP | UDP | IP | <L2 stuff><p>SGSN <-> GGSN (Gn): <your data> | GTP | UDP | IP | <L2 stuff><p>GGSN <-> Internet (Gi): <your data> (finally!)<p>At some points your data's UDP/TCP headers might be compressed/uncompressed but thats the basic idea. Something needs to perform the functions performed by all these nodes. ""Traditionally"" the femtocell is a combination of the RNC/NodeB (aka the Radio Access Network).<p>Clearly it is possible to add core network functionality to the femtocell, but not only is it probably not worth it, the security implications are tricky (you would have to expose your HLR directly to the internet to be able to talk to the femtocell - instead of just your SGSN, which you would likely have special CN nodes for talking to femtocells).<p>So it is almost guaranteed to be the former. And it makes AT&T's recommendations make alot more sense. You don't even need to assume any malice in them.",1276899662

Any use of user name or password is coincidental.<p>That's just incorrect usage of terminology by (most likely) marketing/PR people.<p>In the olden days, you had to log on to your ISP over a modem.  ""Logging on"" happened all the time to access anything outside your computer.<p>I suspect that the occasional use of ""log on"" in reference to simply visiting websites will disappear in favor of simply ""visit"".  ""Log on"" will continue to be used and abused with connection to sites that actually want you to log on (after all, what better way to turn your website into a money maker than by gathering user data).<p>> It's a lost cause.

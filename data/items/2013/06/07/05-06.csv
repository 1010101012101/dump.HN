5837495,comment,5826836,5826836,1,0,lonster,,,"What are you saying? That welders and plumbers are making more than you? There's two good reasons that's the case, if it's so. (1) They work way harder, physically, and have to deal with burns, OPP (Other People's Poop), and a bunch of engineer-types as customers who try to ""fix"" things first and then finally give up and call a pro, but want to learn from the pro the whole time he/she is working. If that doesn't command $50/hour, I don't know what does. (2) You should be doing more intense programming. I don't know your skillset, but if you're mainlining Cobol with a dose of Lisp and keeping some foreign government from collapse, you'll make more than a plumber. But if you're honing CSS all day and your workplace cubicle is surrounded with Manga and everyone has corporate logos on Macbooks, and there are ""decompress rooms"" filled with Herman Miller furniture, well, keep in mind your comfort level at work may partially explain your salary. I kind of think the poop guys should get more money than you.",1370584684

The process of getting hold of the people with enough clearance to be able to deny alone takes time. Let alone ensure that the statement is approved by senior management and legal.<p>Usually the best statement you can get within 24 hours is ""we're taking these allegations very seriously and are looking into it"".<p>This very much feels like a scripted response to an anticipated scenario.",1370584672

If torturing, say, five people a year for one day each, prevented all deaths from war and terrorism for the whole year? Make that deal any day.<p>To me the problem with torture isn't that it's ""bad"". It's that it doesn't serve a useful purpose and serves many counter-purposes.

5837492,comment,5836501,5836501,4,0,adventured,,,"This is pretty simple: if they got to AT&T and Verizon, it's crazy to think they wouldn't get Google / Microsoft / Facebook / Apple.<p>Apple has recently been the world's largest company, and has nearly half the US smart phone market.<p>Microsoft still has a practical monopoly in desktop operating systems (and combined with Apple they cover 98% or so of the market). Also, Microsoft was already leashed by the Feds via anti-trust. Once you're under their heel, there's no going back.<p>Google, well, comeon... they're a data wet dream. Ditto Facebook. One has a near monopoly in search, and develops the most popular mobile operating system (reaching almost a billion users), the other has a monopoly in social (particularly the kind of social where Joe Smith uses it every day).<p>For all intents and purposes, once a company gets as big as these guys, they become government/corporate entities, no longer strictly corporate in nature. Much like Boeing or Bank of America or GE or Exxon. The intermingling is impossible to avoid at their size. And in fact, the Feds would never allow you to remain very distant at such size, too many lobbyists and too much money and power is in play.<p>And while we're at it, let's remember the close ties to the Obama Administration that some of these companies enjoy. Hardly far-fetched to imagine them cooperating with continuously expanding espionage programs, particularly even more so when they like the administration in power (I would say it's plausible even that companies would be less likely to fight if they thought highly of an administration; personal political bias clouding judgment, how many have fallen for the Obama campaign charm?).",1370584625

My case should be fairly typical, so I expect the responses I get to be useful to others in my situation too.<p>First, some context: I work for a big company on a popular online service. I have a masters degree and my field is machine learning. I'm smarter than all my peers at work.<p>I started off with a my-code-is-going-to-change-the-world attitude. I remember my heart racing the first time I was looking at results of my code processing petabytes of data. Then, slowly my smart, idealistic, I-will-create-perfect-AI self started bumping into reality. Rather than math/ML challenges, I was faced with problems like technical debt, missed deadlines, unmet expectations, unhealthy peer competition, endless frog-eating, fragmented days, daily scrums... to cut a long story short, it has been a long time since I did anything that I'm proud of.<p>And I have been in the company for more than 7 years now. Yes, I should just leave and go to a better place - that much is obvious. But here's the thing - I don't expect it to be better anywhere else. I don't want to join another big company and slowly nudge some KPIs upwards. I want to solve hard problems. Problems not solved yet. Problems that are important and that matter. The answer that I'm going to get maybe ""go join a startup"". But I'm an immigrant on work visa and this is risky. Also, I have a pretty demanding family life and I'm not sure I'd be able to put it the long hours.<p>After being frustrated for a long time and some failed attempts to change the situation, I have decided to go all-in and explore all my options aggressively. I cannot afford to not change things any more. I plan to interview a lot.<p>I could use the advice of people on HN. Have you had similar experiences? How did you get out of it? Am I being too pessimistic about potential opportunities? What are the things I should look out for before accepting my next offer? Is there hope for me?",1370583899

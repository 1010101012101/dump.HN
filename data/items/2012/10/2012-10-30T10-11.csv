If the question cannot be answered as a clear cut fact then an discussion is inevitable. Also some questions by their very nature attract discussions and they turn out to be the most interesting ones.<p>As somebody else also mentioned, some topics just can't have a clear factual answer like religion, literature etc.<p>The problem with factual answers is, there is only that much you can do with general problems that everyone face. Once those questions(problems which every one face generally) are answered, your site turns to a knowledge repository.

The more likely explanation is that it can't be done because ARM is a better designed and therefore intrinsically more power efficient ISA than x86.<p>In any case, the more pressing problem for Intel is that in the mobile space consumers don't know or care what types of chips are in their phones so even if Intel could design an x86 chip competitive with ARM, consumers are unwilling to pay a brand premium for Intel that they're used to getting in the desktop market.",1351594515

There are circumstances in which what we might call implied consent can be assumed unless explicitly withdrawn: a healthy, long-term, committed relationship in which both parties have a clearly and explicitly maintained understanding about it.<p>Outside of such circumstances, consent should not be assumed - particularly when alcohol is involved. In this case, the concept of ""no means no"" may inadvertently do something of a disservice by implying that consent is given unless it is explicitly denied. Hence we now have the concept of ""yes means yes"", which indicates that consent is <i>not</i> given unless it is granted explicitly.",1351593660

The latter group likely isn't who they want.<p>Clearly the former group is not <i>enough</i>, given that Google has an army of recruiters who keep hassling a lot of us who have never applied to Google and/or who have turned them down for interviews or jobs before, or who have even worked for them and left.<p>They recognise they are losing out on a lot of good candidates, or they wouldn't have these people calling the same potential candidates over and over and over.<p>And from personal experience I <i>know</i> a lot of their recruiters are frustrated at how hard it is for them to fill many positions, and how often they approach candidates and are explicitly turned down because people don't consider it worthwhile subjecting themselves to their interview process when they can easily get jobs with competitive packages and terms elsewhere.<p>The last Google recruiter who contacted me called me to <i>plead</i> for me to do a second round management interview after I was lukewarm after the totally botched tech interview I've mentioned in this thread - she'd gotten approval to simply skip doing another tech interview completely after the tech interviewer did his ridiculous nonsense.<p>But who would I keep putting myself through that shit?

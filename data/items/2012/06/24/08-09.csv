Basically, I've often, in the past, jumped into spending a lot of time outdoors shirtless in the summer time and would get sunburned once but then from that point on would not. It seems that the sustained sun keeps one's ""tolerance"" up so that sunburns don't reoccur at least until the skin gets less tan again (when less time is spent outdoors)",1340528265

4152891,comment,4152576,4152576,2,0,tete,,,"I think there should be more major cities like SF.<p>The reason is that this will cause infrastructure to be built. While I am (still) living in Europe and have very good infrastructure as someone interested into technology I fear that such developments could cause infrastructure to mainly be built at certain cities making everyone else living in some kind of desert, which could cause places to be underdeveloped, which leads to inequality, which then leads to unused potential, which is generally a problem that people see way too seldom these days. If you have people that are poor and stuff this means you loose potential, which means you waste the chance of someone bringing everyone forward, which maybe causes the next Einstein (just to make a point) to become a criminal instead of solving problems and creating amazing technologies.<p>One could see it as evolution. If the first humans had have bad luck, because of being at a bad spot, where intelligence wouldn't have helped at all, there was a drought period or just a predator or a virus, maybe even a meteorite they could have just gone extinct and could have exterminated a race that now can be considered dominant.<p>You could also see this with genes, like the one that causes western people to be able to drink milk. If the first individuals had back luck we probably wouldn't have that option now.<p>So every time you prevent someone from having the right infrastructure, eduction, society, life and if it's just the money you potentially prevent someone from solving the biggest problems.<p>Yes, one can argue that someone smart could make his life everywhere, but people need to learn this first. No matter how smart you are, if you just don't know you can do it that way, because you have no examples and no parents that tell you to make something out of yourself and instead society just reinforces you to do something different or bad you won't become a scientist, even if you'd have the potential for a Nobel Prize, unless something causes you to find it out, have self-esteem, etc.<p>So, it's okay to build nice technology cities and invest money in certain areas and places, but it would not only be bad, but also dumb if this makes you forget about the rest.",1340525501

Somewhere along the line she starts asking for help and seeing how I was the only one who knew any programming I volunteered to help. I didn't know very much Java, just knew programming from learning Perl, but Java was easy enough to pick up.<p>Initially, I was excited. Hey, here's this girl taking computer science. But towards the end, I think I'm the only one who walked away really learning Java and ended up ""coaching"" her through all her homework, basically just telling her what to type although trying to make sure she understood the concepts each step of the way. I ended up disappointed because she only wanted to pad her resume instead of really learn computer science. Maybe it was taking the class online that didn't let her get interested in the subject, or maybe she just wanted to get the grade and get it over with.<p>The point is, I think we need to do a better job getting kids in general interested in computer science, not just girls, if we want more girls to go into computer science. Get rid of this misconception that it's just graybeards in a dark room hacking away through the night and put it in kids heads that computer science, or even just programming, is something everyone can do and have fun doing. And maybe try to de-emphasize getting a grade as a goal and emphasize actual learning as a goal. But most importantly, expand computer science availability in high school, so you don't have to resort to taking online classes, which I think are a bad idea in general but particularly bad for kids in high school who are still developing study habits.",1340524829

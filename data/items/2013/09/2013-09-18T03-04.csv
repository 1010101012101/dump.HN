My sister is &#x27;83 and is firmly &#x27;Y&#x27;.<p>I saw the college bubble popping. It&#x27;s why I went to night school and graduated debt free from a state in-state urban public university with a solid, practical program and a degree in business. It was a tough few years, but it also set the expectation that life would suck for a few years and then would get better, and I would find a way to do what I wanted after I met the goal.<p>Too many people, the author of the linked rant (I won&#x27;t dignify it by calling it an article) seem to have been sold a promise of a fulfilling fun college experience and fulfilling fun career if only they mortgaged themselves. Mortgaging yourself <i>never</i> is a good idea. That is a horrible approach. I hope that the generation now in high school learns from their errors.",1379476704

No. Destroy their income earning ability? Probably.<p>That&#x27;s a great idea. I&#x27;m not sure why I didn&#x27;t think of it.

I&#x27;m sure everybody around here would be happy with the arrangement.<p>> I would provide more rights to nurse practitioners, subsidize their training with job guarantees...I would invest heavily (through DARPA and the NIH) in continuing the development of vaccines and protocols for chronic illnesses (thereby providing STEM jobs), and leveraging DARPA (again), continue to invest in robotics for robotic surgery apparatus (a la DiVinci Surgical System).<p>Thank goodness the United States government doesn&#x27;t have a problem with debt.

Its local currency (US Dollars) in a world economy. At a high enough price you can build nuclear plants and fast breeder reactors that eat all their own fuel. And use that energy to make long chain hydrocarbons (aka oil) out of CO2 and electrolisys of water [1].

There is some thoughts that you can run F-T reactors using concentrated solar in the desert.<p>But to you point of &#x27;running out of cheap energy&#x27; what does that mean if the economy has adjusted to the cost of that energy? Look at electric cars as a prime example, sure they are expensive today but what happens 10 years from now when they are everywhere?

6403349,comment,6403091,6403210,2,0,rlanday,,,"This is why I wonder, to this day, why a coalition of entrepreneurs do not support a basic income. It is the ultimate hedge against failure in a capitalistic society, and would severely curtail the risks of failed ventures for every individual.<p>Doesnt that kind of sound like privatize the gains, socialize the losses? I dont really see how entrepreneurs would benefit overall from a basic income; successful individuals would have to pay for this through higher taxes, which would probably disincentivize risk-taking overall. Intuitively, it seems to me that any sort of scheme that tries to cheat the free market by subsidizing people who take risks and fail at the expense of those who either succeed or avoid risks probably overincentivizes risk-taking. Why should someone who doesnt think their idea is good enough to put their own money at risk and cant find anyone else who wants to invest and put their money at risk either get a taxpayer subsidy?<p>This makes especially little sense in Silicon Valley:
OK, I quit my well-paying tech job with health insurance and free food because I thought I could successfully bootstrap the next big social media blogging platform with my entire life savings, and now Im somehow unemployable, bankrupt, and homeless, I deserve a bailout!<p>Obviously, there needs to be some amount of risk-taking, but Im extremely doubtful that it makes sense in general for the government to subsidize starting tech companies, especially when there are so many willing private investors. I agree that having health insurance be largely the employers responsibility does complicate switching jobs and starting companies.",1379476374

What is worse is all these &quot;You can be anything&quot; dreams start becoming undeniably impossible, like being a fighter pilot or competing in the Olympics. But the worst bit for me was thinking &quot;Wow, that didn&#x27;t seem all that long, am I really going to be 70 in just that much more time?&quot; And frankly a mixture of panic and depression set in. I&#x27;m never going to be &quot;somebody&quot;, I&#x27;m over the hill, all of my heroes were famous by this age, Etc. It doesn&#x27;t stop.<p>And for me it was the time where I really internalized that life isn&#x27;t about the goals, its about the trip and the stops along the way. Imagine your life is to drive from the San Francisco Airport to JFK in New York and catch a flight and fly back. That is your life. And sure you put goals in like &quot;see the Grand Canyon&quot; or something which takes you down a side path but once you have seen the Canyon, maybe hiked Zion, skiied the Rockies, you just have to keep driving east. And you hit Kansas which goes on and on and on and on and on.<p>I had started piling up things from the &#x27;someday&#x27; pile into the &#x27;remember when?&#x27; pile, like  from &#x27;someday I&#x27;ll have kids&#x27; to &#x27;remember when we didn&#x27;t have kids?&#x27; When that &#x27;someday&#x27; pile gets smaller you can imagine it has nothing in it but &#x27;someday I&#x27;m going to die&#x27; well that is a scary thing to imagine indeed.<p>So it sucks, but what can you do about it? The thing I found that got me past that was focusing really hard on what I had (a great family), what I could change (where I wanted to be), and how I felt about the world (my outlook on the future). By focusing on that I kept from looking at that ugly visage of Christmas Yet to Come, and the fear and guilt that came along with it. I stopped following the news for a while since it only wanted to reinforce my fear of the future. I fed my curiosity and tried to seek out sources of wonder again (rocketry, quantum physics, and robotics systems are all amazing things to me).<p>That keeps me engaged and interested and learning, and in so doing keeps the future away in the future.",1379475526

We can never really compare with other people regarding where we were born but unless you have spent significant time living in other countries, I really wonder about this.  It&#x27;s like saying &quot;Budweiser is so great beer I will never even try another!&quot;<p>Now a different perspective.  I have spent around four months in Ecuador living with middle to upper class families there, and around three years total living in Indonesia.  What I can tell you is that poverty in these countries is <i>qualitatively different</i> than poverty in the US, so much so that it is really hard to say one is worse than the other for most of the bottom 20%.  For the bottom few percent though there is no question.   The availability of affordable, nutritious food and basic shelter is much better here in Indonesia (and in Ecuador) for the poorest of the poor than it is in the US.  Water is somewhat different but availability of water that won&#x27;t kill you in the short term isn&#x27;t a problem (drinking boiled polluted water is however).<p>Economically the poor have more stuff in the US, but they also carry a lot more debt, have more restrictions on what they can do, and they have weaker family ties, which means they have access, paradoxically, to less capital.<p>So I am not sure.  I think that the bottom 50% may not be that much worse off in most other countries and I think there is a certain American arrogance which looks at the way we destroy the families, neighborhoods, and communities of the less well off as &quot;progress.&quot;  But if you never live elsewhere for long enough to really get the sense of how other people live, you don&#x27;t see it.",1379475157

The simple fact is that if you want to be an entrepreneur, it is hard these days to justify a college education if coming out of it means five figures of debt that you have to pay back.  This debt hangs like a stone around the necks of the younger generations who are struggling to swim in turbulent economic waters.<p>So entrepreneurship becomes a privilege of the wealthy, and yet another way to suck money from everyone else.  We don&#x27;t need a government safety net.  We need an organic one.<p>One option as you say would be something like an entrepreneur&#x27;s guild.  This could be a good idea--- it could function as a sort of labor union among startups, and also a safety net for founders.  It could also help ensure that people who enter as early employees make the kinds of contacts that could let them go into business for themselves.  And despite functioning as a labor union it would not be one, because the stated business would be to help new entrepreneurs succeed (i.e. it would not be adversarial against management).  To work it would have to count as members investors, founders, and workers.",1379474351

An analysis of the problem of prisons doesn&#x27;t require an alternative to be suggested, though. Let me explain.<p>Prisons are awful places that aren&#x27;t designed to prevent crime but rather to punish and control. Prisons are awful solutions to solving crime and have been since they became a popular tool of social control in the late 18th century. Before prisons became frequently used, the sovereign would mostly torture and maybe publicly execute criminals. But spectators sometimes would be sickened by this and revolt, freeing the condemned, leading to the questioning of the rule of Law and King. A more efficient solution to problems of social control was invented with the modern prison. Lock people up, and they can&#x27;t run wild on the street stealing bread and shit.<p>The US prison system contains 2.3 million people in sick conditions. In the last thirty years, since the economic crisis of the 70&#x27;s and the decline of welfare services and social democracy, the prison population has exploded with the help of drug laws. This is an apparatus to control the unemployable population so that they aren&#x27;t running wild on the streets stealing your Macbook.<p>One alternative idea is restorative justice. Working with the victims and community to understand the root cause of the &#x27;crime&#x27; committed and reach a resolution. The offender then is a crucial part of the process. This is similar to what indigenous societies did. This probably wouldn&#x27;t work in a mass society.",1379474008

I suppose you can look at this as unfair to you.<p>You might want to realize you have been born at very close to the best place and time economically for any human in history.  You are likely in the top .5% of lucky people though maybe not quite as lucky as someone born in 1950 in the USA (if you were white anyway).<p>The 1960&#x27;s in the USA was probably the richest middle class in the richest society ever in human history.  That you might be a bit less lucky than that hardly seem like being super unlucky.<p>And frankly, while I agree, those born a few years earlier in the USA had a better shot of bing in the top .5% of the world economic lucky winners than those born in the USA today do I would still rather be born today (or twenty... years ago).  Basically I&#x27;ll take the other gains and accept the economic well being is not as largely in my favor.<p>The article seems to talk of blaming those born recently for their situation.  That is lame.  They have almost nothing to do with why they have this economic situation versus someone born 40 years ago.  But that misses the main point.

6403210,comment,6403091,6403091,15,0,FD3SA,,,"Fascinating. I constantly wonder about the psychological mindset of entrepreneurs in the US. It seems to me that being an entrepreneur is the riskiest profession imaginable in the USA. Unless you come from a family of means, failure becomes a one way ticket to homelessness, malady, and squalor. The social safety net is extremely poor and unforgiving, such that one mistake could be a life changer.<p>This is why I wonder, to this day, why a coalition of entrepreneurs do not support a basic income. It is the ultimate hedge against failure in a capitalistic society, and would severely curtail the risks of failed ventures for every individual.<p>This would massively incentivize the fail-fast mantra of startups, and unleash a scramble to create the most valuable and profitable companies with a long term focus.<p>I&#x27;m not holding my breath for basic income in the USA, but if Europe or the Commonwealth countries instigate it first, it would be a massive draw for serious entrepreneurs in the long term. Of course, this would have to be balanced by access to capital, which does not necessarily require presence in traditional VC hotspots (many UWaterloo companies have gone thru YC and received top tier VC funding).<p>This is the world I hope to see going forward. Basic income, single payer or nationalized healthcare, and a long term focus on efficiency at the state and national levels.",1379473944
6403209,comment,6400175,6401964,3,0,IgorPartola,,,"I have been doing lots of research on this recently and here is the main thing that makes ZFS win every time:<p>When you have a RAID of any kind you need to periodically scrub it, meaning compare data on each drive byte by byte to all other drives (let&#x27;s assume we are talking just about mirroring). So if you have two drives in an mdadm array and the scrubbing process finds that a block differs from drive A to drive B, and neither drive reports an error, then the scrubber simply takes the block from the highest numbered drive and makes that the correct data, copying it to the other drive. What&#x27;s worse is that even if you use 3 or more drives, Linux software RAID does the same thing, despite having more info available. On the other hand, ZFS does the scrubbing by checksums, so it knows which drive has the correct copy of the block.<p>How often does this happen? According to what I have been reading, without ECC RAM and without ZFS, your machines get roughly one corrupt bit per day. In other words, that could be a few corrupt files per week.<p>My conclusion is that as I am building my NAS, I want ECC RAM and ZFS for things I cannot easily replicate.",1379473938

Nobody really had an idea how to structure a web app, so it was more or less a dozen or so CGIs which read/wrote to flat files through custom-written dbm clone (woo, NoSQL in &#x27;96!). Lots of unsophisticated string munging.<p>Maybe if we&#x27;d had some better abstractions, it wouldn&#x27;t have been as painful, but C code written to do a lot of ad hoc string cobbling is, in fact, a little crazy.<p>Despite this, the product pretty much worked and actually had a few hundred customers and a future.<p>(We even got looked at by Yahoo, but they bought some outfit named Viaweb instead.)",1379473305

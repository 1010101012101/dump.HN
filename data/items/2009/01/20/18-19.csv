I think that the internet does a better job with national and international news, but I rely almost entirely on newspapers for local coverage.  In the Chicago area, at least, the Tribune has done an excellent job with local news. Not only do they do a decent job with most major stories, but they've put out a lot of great investigative series in the past.  Among other things, they were key in exposing corruption to the public in a number of cases, including George Ryan.

You'll have a long, hard road ahead, but it can be done.<p>If you just want to get something working, find existing hardware (iPhone, Android, tablet PC, etc) that does what you need and code for it. This is by far the cheaper option until you get into selling thousands of copies. Since building thousands of units requires even more tens of thousands of dollars, it's a fair bet that you'll be better off with expensive hardware for a long time.<p>I am an EE/SE with plenty of experience who sometimes takes on contract work. I was actually asked to build a device like this recently. Small quantities, say 5-20 per year. My suggestion to the buyer was that we use a mini/micro ITX board, standard off the shelf electronic hardware and a simple custom designed hardware interface that I would only charge him about $1k to design and that could be built for about $70 each. And this is a very simple board that has 1/1000 the complexity of a NIC card that you can buy at MicroCenter for $10.<p>Custom hardware in small to moderate quantities is <i>expensive</i> make no bones about it.",1232476562

But ClearCase with UCM has an equally powerful branching capability and in some ways is easier to use and manage (from a developer perspective).  And there's probably at least 10 years of development and actual large-scale use behind it.  It's good stuff, or at least the theory and workflows (just tune out the CC implementation parts).<p>FYI, my background was as a consultant in enterprise version control dealing with a number of different products: PVCS, Dimensions, Harvest, Starteam and ClearCase.  All centralized and all working in completely different ways.  I'd spent over three years on ClearCase architecting, implementing and managing a large-scale deployment before picking up Git.",1232476355

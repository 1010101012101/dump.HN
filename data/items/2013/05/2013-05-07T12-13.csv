They are small matters, I agree: Metro apps can be completely ignored and most of what I used the start menu for is just as it was (ctrl+esc, start typing, pick from list) and is in some ways better, <i>but</i> it is still a change in look and feel that for a novice user adds friction.<p>Worse for a marketing/sales point of view: there are people who have not really formed an opinion and have decided to avoid Windows 8 (not upgrading, buying a machine with 7 instead, or getting the option and downgrading to 7 like many did from Vista to XP) because there is a lot of press questioning the UI changes. These people might not know that the change is minor when you consider their entire day, but it is being talked about it loudly enough that MS don't want to take the risk.<p>Another problem for Windows 8 is of course that many people simply have no real need to upgrade and no end of additional UI options is going to change that. If people have no problem with Win7 then MS can make Win8 look exactly like Win7 and it'll make no difference to that class of user (a very large class of user) unless they offer the upgrade for free.<p>The only reason I have 8 is that I was rebuilding my main home PC, it was a very cheap upgrade a the time, and I might have need to do Windows Phone 8 development in the not-too-distant future (the SDK for that will not install on older Windows).",1367930779

5667788,comment,5666587,5666587,25,0,bane,,,"I agree with this article that communication with companies is getting absurdly poor. With all these communications channels available, why is it so hard to send a quick email? Don't have time because of too many candidates? Maybe you shouldn't have more candidates than you have time to handle.<p>I've reached a point in my career where I'm not interested in engineering positions anymore (a great motivator has been to avoid the absurd SV-style interview). SV-style companies don't know what to do in these situations, they have an open position, I have the experience and skill set, let's have a conversation about the work I've done and what your needs are.<p>Problem is, nobody in the company knows how to hire for these positions and they seem to be done based on word of mouth or through the networks of the investors or other seniors in the company. In a couple of interviews at these companies, they plan for the usual all-day interview, and then I sit there in front of an interviewer who is simply at a loss for what to ask me.<p>On occasion they haul out a brain teaser, but I usually stop that with a ""you do realize the position that you are hiring for is not one where solving brain teasers will be a reflection of the kind of work I'll be doing"". This rings some alarm bells as some of the larger SV companies have found themselves on the business end of a law suit for this. Asking prospective project managers nonsense questions during an interview offers no information to the hiring committee about the suitability of a candidate. This can create a legal liability for the company if the unhired candidates feel they've been discriminated against -- especially if the company just hires somebody they know anyway -- proving that the position wasn't filled on a level playing field for all the candidates.<p>One other problem I've faced, I simply make too much money these days. In an interview with a now very large company that exactly matches the format in this article, I made it through the interview gauntlets and finally got to the compensation round:<p>""So what kind of compensation are you looking for?""<p>""Well, I made this much last year, I'd like to make at least that much this year and going forward.""<p><i>blank stare of shock</i> ""y-y-you made how much?""<p>""Well, it was a mix of sources, my base was this, I made this much in bonuses and additional grants, and I was helpful in a few sales and earned this much commission. I don't expect that this job is commissionable, but I'm open to alternate mixes of compensation so long as my base stays about the same.""<p>""y-y-you realize not even the CEO is pulling down that much base?""<p>""I'm afraid I'm not privy to your company's compensation packages, but I know that the CEO reported a few tens of millions in stock grants last year, I'm not expecting <i>that</i> much, but if you feel the need to offer a lower base, I'd like to expedite the vesting schedule by a year then""<p>""I-I-I.....I'll see what I can do.""<p>And that ended that job right there. I received a very nice call with a rejection a week later.<p>Another anecdote, a friend of mine interviewed for a VP position with another major SV company, he got through the initial rounds based on his education (Ivy-League) and other credentials. During the interview they decided to do the equivalent of an engineering-style interview...the recruiting team had clearly dug deep into the bowels of some undergrad finance textbooks, and asked him to derive a number of finance formulae he hadn't seen or cared about in 20 years. It was utterly random and doomed to failure. He went on to other companies where we was quite successful, while that position remained open for the better part of two years before finally being filled with a friend of one of the investors.<p>The best places I've worked (as an engineer and otherwise) have been the ones that don't engage in this nonsense. I can see a simple fizzbuzz test being a prescreen as being useful, but just sitting down with a candidate and having a conversation about their resume seems to work best. Bonus, it's respectful of the candidate. Unlike a great many companies, you've actually taken the time to look at their resume. If you recognize something on the resume, ask them some penetrating questions and dig into what they know. If you don't recognize something, engage them to teach you about it. Competent people are competent at talking about their job. Ask them things like ""can you give me examples of where you applied algorithm design or at least some complexity theory in a job?"" If they give an example, probe deeper, have them talk in depth about the algorithm, see what they remember from their undergrad about big-O. Or ""what was the most difficult integration you've ever faced?"" followed with a ""why?"". Dig in, make it a conversation. Let them become a teacher during the interview, where they teach you about what they know and about their life. Ask questions like a student would. It's respectful, humble and draws unbelievable amounts of information from a candidate.<p>You'll quickly learn what kinds of things they know, what they don't know and what they're weak at. You'll also learn about their soft skills, like communication. Instead of playing an insipid game of cat and mouse, you'll learn about the <i>person</i> you're hiring.

The monopoly was defended by an imperial decree, condemning to death anyone attempting to export silkworms or their eggs. Only around the year 300 CE did a Japanese expedition succeed in taking some silkworm eggs and four young Chinese girls, who were forced to teach their captors the art of sericulture.<p><p>While the Chinese lost their monopoly on silk production, they were able re-established themselves as major silk supplier (during the Tang dynasty) and industrialize their production in a large scale (during the Song dynasty). China continued to export high-quality fabric to Europe and the Near East along the silk road.<p><p>Much later, following the Crusades, techniques of silk production began to spread across Western Europe. In 1147 while Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos was focusing all his efforts on the Second Crusade, the Norman king Roger II of Sicily attacked Corinth and Thebes, two important centres of Byzantine silk production. They took the crops and silk production infrastructure, and deported all the workers to Palermo, thereby causing the Norman silk industry to flourish. The sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204 brought decline to the city and its silk industry, and many artisans left the city in the early 13th century. Italy developed a large domestic silk industry after 2000 skilled weavers came from Constantinople. Many also chose to settle in Avignon to furnish the popes of Avignon.<p>The sudden boom of the silk industry in the Italian state of Lucca, starting in the 11th and 12th centuries was due to much Sicilian, Jewish, and Greek settlement, alongside many other immigrants from neighbouring cities in southern Italy.[24] With the loss of many Italian trading posts in the Orient, the import of Chinese styles drastically declined. Gaining momentum, in order to satisfy the rich and powerful bourgeoisie's demands for luxury fabrics, the cities of Lucca, Genoa, Venice and Florence were soon exporting silk to all of Europe. In 1472 there were 84 workshops and at least 7000 craftsmen in Florence alone.",1367930357

Because of the way the Banking system works, that currency must be exchanged so that it can reflect in my account.  This exchange is performed at the current market rate, plus some surcharge of fees levied by Paypal's liquidity provider to perform the currency conversion, and by Paypal in order to cover the SWIFT interbank charges plus any backoffice administration they need to do to verify my identity.  There are additional verifications they need to perform on the US side; for e.g. that my bank account is not on a Interpol, NSA, FBI, CIA or INS watch list.<p>That money is then sent, likely via the SWIFT interbank network, which levies a charge.<p>Those funds arrive at my bank, where my bank levies a charge.  The money reflects in my account, and I see that 'Paypal' have given me a terrible exchange rate.<p>They haven't.  They've likely given me a reasonable rate, because it is not in their interests to charge punitive exchange rates as it will drive customers to competitors.<p>My point is that there is a whole different level of processing and infrastructure hidden behind Paypal's facade that you are not privy to; all of it has people performing tasks to move the currency from a US account to a Indian account, and all of that requires a modicum of human oversight because of incredibly strict financial fraud controls.<p>Trust me when I say that the small markup Paypal is charging you is nothing compared to the level of bureaucracy you would run into were you to try to perform the above exchange manually.",1367928910

A dialect is distinguished by its vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation (phonology, including prosody). Where a distinction can be made only in terms of pronunciation (including prosody, or just prosody itself), the term accent is appropriate, not dialect.

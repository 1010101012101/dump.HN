That'd poison the workplace. They'd be incompetent if they told you their private thoughts!<p>The evaluation numbers are not public data. But once in the public school district I attended years ago, I got to see the raw teacher scores from in-room evaluations. Because all teachers seemed to put on a 'dog and pony' show the days that evaluators sat in, I was afraid they'd have no correlation with my perceptions the rest of the year.<p>And yet, while I did not have enough access to perform a detailed analysis, the teachers I thought bad had low evaluations, from both their immediate supervisors and the 'neutral' observers from the district. The ones I thought good had high evaluations.<p>K-12 teacher competence is not a complicated matter, imperceptible to all but the finest measurements and highly-trained observers. If you're really curious and have the time, ask your district if you can observe the teachers you're most interested in knowing about.<p>My impression that the quality of services provided by public employees has stagnated or declined is more general than just 'teaching quality'. It's whole-system outputs.<p>In the school sphere my impression is driven by how the exact same problems and anguish are being expressed today as 10 years ago, 20 years ago, and 30 years ago (which is as far back as I've been paying attention). And roughly all the same quantifiable complaints are being advanced.<p>Dropout rates remain high – even with rampant under-reporting by state educational departments. When there are occasionally slight improvements in test scores, it's often shown to be due to manipulation of the comparison pools, or nasty tradeoffs to meet hollow numerical targets. And yet, if schools are to be run by large state-oriented (or even worse nation-oriented) bureaucracies, then managing by crude numerical targets are all that's possible.<p>In the past 30 years, teacher's unions (and other public employees' unions) have risen to become some of the most powerful political groups in each state. Have schools wildly improved over this same period? Are we now in a golden era of public services? Are civil servants now more respected than ever before?<p>Or perhaps, the 50-year experiment in public-sector unionism has maximized things other than positive results – like off-budget pension obligations and partisanship.",1299364199

2292627,comment,2291336,2291446,0,0,socialmediaking,,,"If you ran ads with 500,000 displays and only 13 or so clicks, you did something horribly wrong. Facebook ads have a value because they can be ultra targeted. There are many ways ways you could have made a mistake, for instance, demographics that were too unspecific, bad images, not enough variations (i use 10+ sometimes), bad copy, etc.<p>I like to look at the comparison of google ads vs facebook ads as such: If you want to provide a service/product to people who are seeking that solution, use Google ads. And if you want to go to the targeted demographic directly and present your solution/product/message, use Facebook.<p>An example would be if you sold wedding services in miami. You could go on facebook and target women 25-35 who are engaged and live in miami. The ads would display only for the targeted demographic and would likely have a good click-through rate. Or you could go into google adwords and buy terms related to wedding services miami or zipcode+wedding service. The differences here are that a woman in the younger demographic is much more likely to be spending hours on facebook and only minutes on a google search.<p>In addition, google also has incredibly high competition for some of the more lucrative keywords and it is getting increasingly more competitive in local search, now requiring a top 7 ranking to really matter in the local listings.<p>Also, never underestimate the cpm (cost per thousand) displays of facebook ads to the targeted demographic. They work great for events like concerts and other events when simple awareness is key. A good image also helps a lot, as I run ads with the same text and different images and see dramatic differences in the number of clicks.<p>It's difficult for me to believe that ""nobody cares about Facebook ads and no one clicks on them"" because Facebook Ads (and Google Adwords/Adsense) operate as markets, with a bidding system on price. I almost don't want to post this because the more people who know about and use facebook ads, the higher the price rises. Their prices have been steadily rising over the last year as more and more business try them out. They do work, but not for every product and not for every demographic. But people wonder how facebook can have such a high valuation, because they underestimate the amount of direct access and data Facebook has to over 500 million people.<p>The ads do work, but to create a good campaign requires knowledge of the platform, and experience in marketing, advertising, and copywriting. Laypeople assume they don't need marketers and can do buys themselves, and more cheaply, but usually end up spending more. The true gold in online advertising though, comes from what happens after the person clicks.",1299363576

For now it's the most practical way of doing backups, updates, and syncing large amounts of content. I do think Apple will move in the direction of not requiring a PC for these things but it's non-trival. How do you sync 16-64GB of data over 3G? Do you push 300MB+ updates to someone with a 150MB/month data cap? 2GB? How, and where, do you sync purchased content? How do you backup the device? This is a very important feature iTunes provides that most people won't even notice until they have some need to restore a device.<p>The newest iOS update has modified the way OS updates work by not erasing/re-syncing the device. I suspect this is one of the first steps towards moving to a more OTA existence for the iPad. They still need to trim down these updates so they're not killing people's caps. Everything on the content side is going to require a lot more work. If you look at Android for example that does just about everything OTA you realize that a) Google doesn't really sell content so they don't care how or if you get anything on your device. Figure it out yourself. b) Android doesn't backup automatically. Some of your data is synced to Google Services but if you flush your Android phone down the toilet by mistake you're going to lose all your application data and content you synced, or created, on the device. Again -- figure it out yourself if you want a good backup c) Google doesn't update all their devices at the same time. There will never be 100 million+ Android devices trying to download android3.0.tar.gz at the same time. It's a bigger challenge for Apple to do OTA updates given their strategy to update all compatible iOS devices at the same time. I'm not trying to bash Google, their system is fine, but people make it sound like this super trivial thing to divorce post-PC devices from the PC. It's not. Google has been able to do this through minimalism. They don't take any responsibility for updates/backups/syncing so it's a bit easier for them to pull this off right now. If you use Google Exchange with an iOS device you get most of the same benefits in-fact.<p>Apple could easily divorce the activation-via-PC step but it would set the expectation that you don't need to connect it to a PC <i>ever</i> for normal operation/update/syncing. When they do remove the activation-via-PC step you can be sure everything else won't require a PC connection. It will be all or nothing. That's how Apple tends to operate.",1299362923

With an SSD it is less straightforward and it may not be possible to ensure that the data from a particular file has been erased.<p>So from the perspective of a diligent user an SSD is riskier than an HD.<p>However, typical usage of a hard-drive will leave a significant amount of ""deleted"" data still on the drive, except for unusual circumstances (such as subsequently using the drive to near capacity).

2292595,comment,2291977,2291977,0,0,agent86,,,"I used code: NJNNPYMMPHMA<p>- First thing I noticed was that upon launching the app it asked me to rate it.  I haven't even done anything with it yet, so asking me to rate it seems out of place.  You might want to wait a few launches before you request feedback.  Also, it is really annoying that every time I run the app it keeps asking me rate it even though I said ""No Thanks"".  I even agreed to rate it, and it continues to pester me.<p>- In the settings menu, I think I would like it if it played the transition sound when I changed it in the menu.  It was annoying to have to close out that menu and tinker with the app to hear the sounds.<p>- I think I managed to flummox the app a bit.  Not sure if it is as designed, or a bug, but it feels like a bug...<p>Here's what I did:<p>1) Start the app<p>2) Add one song to the playlist<p>3) Click Done<p>4) Click Play to start the list<p>5) Skip ahead to the next song<p>Counter says ""0 down/0 to go"", but the 60 second timer continues to count down.  The play button doesn't do anything, the back button doesn't do anything, but the skip button will reset the 60 second timer and play a sound, despite there being no song present.",1299362655
2292594,comment,2291968,2292172,0,0,tghw,,,"I find the way your phrase that question interesting. Git and Mercurial are nearly identical in terms of functionality, to the point that converting back and forth between them is pretty trivial. (Example: here's Git's repository in Mercurial <a href=""https://mirrors.kilnhg.com/Repo/Mirrors/From-Git/Git"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mirrors.kilnhg.com/Repo/Mirrors/From-Git/Git</a>)<p>The only real difference between the two are the ecosystems. Mercurial, being written is Python, is very portable and easily extensible. I feel like, because of that, the tools for Mercurial are better. Git has GitHub, and the incredible open source community they've developed there.<p>* Note, the rainbow road is due to one of the few differences between Git and Hg: Hg does not allow octopus merges, so the conversion turns them to a sequence of two at a time merges. Also, in the interest of full disclosure, I'm one of the devs on Kiln, so I'm certainly biased towards Hg.",1299362617

Please take a moment and think about this clearly. If Stiglitz was simply saying ""Fraud should be illegal"" then this wouldn't be much of a story, since fraud is already illegal. But Stiglitz is saying ""Gambling recklessly with credit should be considered a form of fraud."" He wants to take a formerly non-criminal behavior and treat it as a form of criminal behavior.",1287856772

1823968,comment,1807123,1811442,0,0,lutorm,,,"Yeah, you're right. A bit of algebra reveals that your delta-V per MASS of fuel (which is a frame-independent quantity) goes as the (propellant specific chemical energy)^.5.<p>However, it is also true that if you calculate the delta-V per unit propellant ENERGY used, it decreases with the propellant specific energy.<p>Since you don't really care about how much energy you carry but only about how much fuel you need to use per delta-V, it's always better to have higher exhaust energy. (As long as you are using a chemical propellant, i.e. the mass carrying the energy and the reaction mass are the same.)<p>The statement in the article about ""propulsive efficiency"" is total bogus. First: the relative kinetic energy of the rocket and the exhaust IS a frame-dependent quantity, so it's meaningless. Second, any reasonable measure of efficiency, like the delta-V per fuel energy, reveals that the ""optimal"" value is an exhaust velocity of zero. (Optimal in the sense that it's more energy efficient, but only because the delta-V goes to zero slower than the energy. It's still a useless optimum, because it results in no delta-V at all...)",1287856664

I started to get tired of having to speculate about what I might be able to deliver so I spent a year or two under-promising on my proposals and eventually got a year ahead of my proposals.  So what I wrote up in my proposals was something that I had already done the year before but not yet published.  So I'd get my grant, work on something completely new, then deliver the previous year's work, and then write up a new proposal to do whatever I had actually done most recently.  I got a reputation for consistently delivering on my promises.<p>Then one year I had a proposal rejected on the grounds that what I was proposing was impossible to do on the budget I had allocated.

Outside of the Manhattan project, I can think of very few instances where the actual engineers involved are in any way irreplacable. So if you don't do it, someone else will anyway. Once the government decides it wants to buy a weapon system, it is going to get it if it is technically and financially feasible.<p>So don't point your finger at this guy, if you have a problem with fighter jets then you need to change the country itself. That is through politics and the military. To me he is just an aerospace engineer that works on the F-22, I see no problem with that.<p>Especially considering the F-22 is barely used and is mostly a weapon to deal with other jets that don't even exist yet. If you are working on biological, nuclear, or chemical weaopns than I'd have problems with it, but something like a missile or a rifle or a tank isn't that ethically bad because we already have plenty of weapons just like them.

But by taking the base-2 logarithm, you can get the exact number of bits required. That's how I rationalize it. The 258-bits-in-100-die-rolls is a nice trick though.<p>This is why the logarithm is my favorite mathematical function -- it's not just an operation on a number, but it also describes various properties of the number itself. Depending on how you use the log, it can describe the number of digits the input has, or how much ""information"" can be contained in the input, and so forth.",1287855969

Instead, it's aiming to be a fast and flexible standalone C core with bindings to higher level languages.  Since it's growing out of Kinosearch, it's best developed bindings are in Perl, but support for all the usual suspects (Python, Ruby, etc.) is planned.<p>Technically, the main difference from Lucene is that it gets cozier with the machine:  the OS is our VM.  It's mostly mmap() IO, and we're very conscious of paging and cache issues.  While we're trying to maintain 32-bit back compatibility, we take full advantage of 64-bit solutions when they offer themselves.  The scripted bindings are also very cool --- you can do things like make callbacks to scoring methods in your script language to truly customize your results.<p>If for some reason you're not finding what you need in Lucene and Solr, check it out. We just became a full Apache incubator project, and are eager to get more developers involved.   You'll find clean C code, decent documentation, and a low traffic but very responsive list.  If you're using Perl, C or C++, you'll get a great product from the start.  If you're using anything else, you'll have to help a lot on the bindings, but I think you'll be quite pleased with the end result.",1287855809

The courts (including the Supreme Court) have decided that this is OK under the interstate commerce clause as long as the tax doesn't make goods from out of state cost more than goods from in state.<p>So, if a state were to try to enforce a tax on mail-order goods from out of state, but did not tax those goods when bought in state, then they would be in for a Constitutional smack down.<p>This gets interesting when a tax was also collected by the state the goods came from. What the courts have decided is that the destination state can only collect the difference between what the receiver paid to the origin state and what the tax would have been for a local purchase.

No one seriously disputes that Texas can make Texas residents pay this tax. The issue is whether Texas can make Amazon collect the tax at time of purchase for Texas. If not, Texas will have to ask its residents to track their Amazon purchases themselves and remit the tax they owe. That's what most states do now--and it is widely ignored.

I only offer that if you haven't considered it.<p>Assuming no class is available, depending on how deeply you want to learn the subject, linear algebra is fairly accessible. It sounds like the introductory level stuff (University 200 level) is what is recommended in that article, so the good news is you don't need a class to learn it.<p>I don't think not having calculus would prevent learning it at this level. Personally I'd just look at reviews for linear algebra textbooks on Amazon and buy the best one. One thing I often do when trying to learn a subject on my own is a go to the University bookstore to figure out what materials I should start with.<p>Then just read the chapters and work the sample problems. When doing any matrix manipulation by hand (boring, but good to verify and help internalize understanding) it's easy to use that software to check results.<p>Basic linear algebra is one of the easier mathematics to teach one's self.",1287854499

For 3 of the last 4 years my sole income was from doing free software.<p>This is 100% spot on:<p>""In other words, your previous answer was a cutesy lie. You do not, in fact, earn a living giving away software. You earn a living getting people to pay you to to write software.""<p>How can an author do that? There is absolutely no equivalence between the economic model around free software and the economic model around music and books. Free software makes money by giving it away to a lot of people, and getting money from the few people that need extra. Some people will pay for you to add a feature or provide support or make a change or put it under a different license or gaurentee uptime. Maybe the project matters so much to a person or group that they will pay someone to work full time on it. This is what makes FOSS go economically.<p>A book is a book for everyone. Once you have the book, what else could you need?<p>And to say that a side project and full time are the same thing is also ridiculous. I did a lot more coding on FOSS when I didn't have a 40-50 hour a week comittment to my FT job going on.",1287854420

The difference between burning a CD or printing a book and sending a digital file is often overblown. If it costs $1 to burn a CD that sells for $10 or $2 to print a book that sells for $25, 90%+ of the money is still paying for other things.<p>Publishers are not as dumb as the pirates think. The publishers just actually have seen the numbers and know that if you take out the cost of printing, you really haven't lowered the cost of the book very much. If you take out the cost of burning the CD, you really haven't lowered the cost to the record label very much. So why should they be expected to now evaporate 100% of their revenue becuase their cost drop 10 or 20 or 30 percent? That is nuts.",1287853974

I.e. sql queries ( if there are foreign key relationships - automatically construct the inner joins ?) to insert, view, update then expose the SQL queries in the target language (my target language is C++) as an API which can be called from the Business layer, automatically construct the User interface ( for example - Web UI/ Text UI (ncurses ui) / GUI ) and retarget it for any database ? If you marked the fields in the create table statements as ""search_key"" can you automatically add the search facility in the sql stored procedure all the way up to the UI.<p>That's what my application is trying to do: Target language=C++, target UI = Web UI using wt, target database = postgres<p>git://github.com/neilxdsouza/codehelper.git<p>Currently it generates a makefile in the output directory which compiles with a Wt (witty) UI which can be run as a standalone web server.

Set up 2-4 indexes using the config options that matter most to you (for me they're AND-OR of search terms, and stopwords, which i use in lists of 0, 50, 100, 150).  Then do a (sort of) A-B test where you see which records one index picks up that the other misses. (Most people\nrecommend not using any stopwords if you're only using one index, but i never got decent results using only one index)<p>P.S. Solr is the 800-pound gorilla, has the terrific Manning book, zillions of docs, etc.  Sphinx probably covers most people's needs config-option wise(at least for European languages) lightning fast to index, and runs in 256M VPS, no tomcat/jetty.",1287853747

You could argue that his/her expenses are lower than someone with a family, but the counter to that again is the income. Someone with a family isn't making a starting salary anymore.<p>Another problem I have with the 401k is that ""most"" people leave it in the hands of fund managers who we're told know what they're doing. I'm one of those that leaves it to a fund manager as well. The biggest argument for the 401k is that the market will perform X% by the time you retire based on historical data. This assumes that trend will continue and that you don't unexpectedly lose a chunk of it as many retirees did in 2008.<p>Another problem I have with the 401k is that it's incredibly illiquid. If you take money out before you retire you're strictly penalized.<p>I'm not saying don't invest in the 401k. I invest in it, but only enough to get my employer's full match. If someone is offering you free money, you take it. I'm suggesting that it's better to take control of your own finances and earn enough passive income to live on.

Second, pick three people in the audience (left, center, right) to do it with.  Speak individually to each one, rotating to the next after about a paragraph, cycling as many times as required.  While you're speaking to someone, they are your proxy for the audience: if she nods the audience is nodding, if she laughs the audience is laughing, if she looks confused the audience is confused.  Adjust as required.<p>Here's how the audience perceives what you're doing: everyone will think you spent roughly one third of the speech talking to them, specifically, which is enough to be flattering but not enough to be creepy.  The constant movement of attention means you keep moving [+] and don't stare at one person for the entire speech.

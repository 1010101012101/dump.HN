But it only took a couple of months before i saw the negative effects - both employees and bosses started asking questions about every little problem that they encountered! This distracted me in the middle of all other work, and billing for it was impossible because they implied it only &quot;took 2 minutes&quot; to reply to. At the end of the sixth month, i got a large job and couldn&#x27;t reply quickly any longer, now, client&#x27;s only ask things of real value (billable value) and often they solve the problem themselves.",1393739992

Note that phone support is also available; people with time-critical issues are encouraged to call in for immediate help.<p>The delay has been a huge success because people correctly assign priority to their concerns by selecting the medium. The back-and-forth is more focused and does not get off-track.<p>An unexpected bonus is that before the delay was introduced, people would often remember how one particular support rep helped them in the past and would hit reply on an old thread to pose a new question, unrelated to the original request. This was confusing (support people leave) and would mess up their issue tracking and happiness metrics.<p>After the delay, this behaviour went away almost completely and they didn&#x27;t experience a statistically significant drop in incident satisfaction.<p>In conclusion, use email for email and use chat for chat. Email starts to feel like chat if you reply too quickly, and that&#x27;s not a good thing.",1393739595

7327894,comment,7325486,7326122,1,0,bsder,,,"> Javascript... what an odd choice. Definitely not my first choice for a language used to teach programming to beginners, nor to run on embedded systems.<p>The problem is that you are looking through a lens of Javascript in 2014 where it has become a bloated pig of a language.<p>Javascript in 1996 when it was introduced ran on a system that was roughly 66MHz, 64MB of RAM, 10&#x27;s of GB of disk, and 56Kbps of bandwidth.  And, it ran as a subsystem inside the Netscape process, so it probably had access to less than 2MB of RAM.  Microchip just released a PIC32 (MIPS R4K) with 200MHz, 512K RAM, and 2MB flash.  That&#x27;s a pretty good match in terms of capabilities.<p>Javascript, the language of 1996, is actually pretty decent and is a small language.<p>Let&#x27;s look at the alternatives:<p>Scheme/Lisp fails for a variety of reasons but the biggest one is that a cons-cell is a terrible abstraction on modern hardware (see Clojure for a Lisp with good modern abstractions).<p>Lua is a 1-based language in a world of 0.  Sorry Lua, but that&#x27;s just not acceptable.  Every time you cross the Lua-C boundary, bugs abound (well, they abound in Lua, too, but I&#x27;m being nice).<p>Forth is stack-based in a world of imperative, register-based abstractions.<p>So, what&#x27;s left?  C.  Which takes almost 18 months to train a new junior programmer in until he&#x27;s useful at embedded programming.  It takes about 6 months to beat C pointer manipulations into his head, and then another 12 months to beat all of the coding conventions into his head so that he doesn&#x27;t blow off his foot.<p>God, I hope Rust gets it right.  Please.  We really need a compiled systems-programming language that works in a world of concurrency.<p>Now, let&#x27;s look at Javascript.<p>Failures:<p>lack of direct hardware accessors--every Javascript will have to grow some way to read/write pointers/memory in embedded.  Yeah, that&#x27;s a big one, but not that huge.<p>function scoping--Correctable with the &quot;let&quot; keyword--just don&#x27;t teach &quot;var&quot;.<p>inheritance--Better to have left it out that to have done the bodge that is the Javascript implementation of prototypal.  Prototypal inheritance is fine, but the way Javascript implements it is terribly broken.<p>mutable system globals--sigh.  Yeah, it&#x27;s enabled beautiful things like installing workaround for broken Javscript interpreters, but it also means there is almost nothing you can count on.<p>So, if you sit and think a while, Javascript is actually pretty <i>good</i> for an embedded language.  It&#x27;s at the 80% point at least.  It&#x27;s probably closer to 90% (once you add a hardware accessors).<p>The real question to ask is: what should an ideal embedded language look like?  Small (check--only Forth is smaller).  Brace syntax (check).  Vectors, Hash Tables, Garbage Collection (check).  Concurrency (fail-but nobody else gets it right yet either).  Interpretable or compilable (check).  Widely known (oh, yeah).<p>Javascript fits the hole.  Yeah, it&#x27;s not what I would have expected, but if you look at it clearly, the evidence checks out.",1393739507

7327881,comment,7324984,7327328,3,0,brudgers,,,"Common Lisp, unlike Scheme, was always a language designed for professional programmers not students. Its big symbols contain values, functions, and property lists to improve performance - lumping all those together with a single pointer and offsets saves a few bytes of memory and reduces the garbage collector&#x27;s workload. Like destructive list manipulation, it&#x27;s not expressing some Computer Science theory; it&#x27;s there because sharp knives are useful.<p>In terms of the importance attached to language aesthetics, ANSI Common Lisp is probably closer to PHP than Ruby, ML, or Python.

Yet, it only had 11 test takers and stastically one would expect 0 hispanic and African-American test takers given the demography of Montana.<p>Basically everywhere the exam was taken in reasonable numbers, females were respresnted, but underrepresented in terms of demographics. Ericson does not specificy if the numbers had grown from previous years. Interestingly, many were from girl-only schools.

7327858,comment,7327470,7327722,1,0,User8712,,,"Agree with a number of these points. First off, isn&#x27;t the main goal creating flip books and reading flip books? I poked around with reading a few books, and the experience was flawed.<p>1. You&#x27;re using the old gimmicky page turn animations. I&#x27;ve never been a fan of these, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone. It would be much better to simply flip to the next page if I click the right side, or flip to the previous page if I click the left side. Optionally, you could add arrows, or setup the clicks for bottom right and bottom left corners.<p>2. I can click the edge of the page to go ahead one. I can&#x27;t go to the previous page, unless I drag the page across.<p>3. Page turn animations got stuck once in a while, and the animation would be following my mouse, when it wasn&#x27;t clicked. Then if I did click, I&#x27;d have two page turn animations moving at once.<p>4. It looks like a traditional book, forced into my widescreen monitor. If it&#x27;s zoomed in, the bottom half of the book is cut off, so I need to scroll up and down constantly. If it&#x27;s zoomed out, the book is a little box in the center of my screen.<p>5. I have no idea how many pages are in a book, or the percentage I&#x27;m done reading. Is this 10 pages, or 500 pages? That&#x27;s kind of an important question.<p>6. The cover images on the homepage are pretty catchy, and I clicked on a few books because the art style or title caught my eye. A suggestion would be something like, <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/YxdZgW3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/YxdZgW3.jpg</a>, where you have categories in a left column, search on top, and book covers on the right.<p>7. Center the page you&#x27;re reading. For example, take a look at <a href=""http://www.20thingsilearned.com/en-US"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.20thingsilearned.com/en-US</a>. It suffers from the same page turning issues, but the book is centered when reading, and the left side simply fades off the screen. It also gives you a few thumbnails at the bottom and a table of contents, which is a nice extra.<p>8. Why not display multiple pages at once? Why leave the back of every page blank? Currently when I open your first featured book, I see <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/BeaNf3B.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/BeaNf3B.jpg</a>. Why don&#x27;t I see something like, <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/0YolAY3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/0YolAY3.jpg</a>, where I get two pages at once to take better advantage of my widescreen? Or, you could even go three pages wide, <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/lUs2aYl.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/lUs2aYl.jpg</a>. I also added a simple arrow to click on the right.<p>In short, although I like the concept of creating and reading books online, the user experience is a little poor. I would never use the site to read a book in its current state. Nonetheless, I think there is some potential, but you really need to focus on the user experience for reading books.",1393738532

It is prized to arrive at a single image which is reproduced as many times as possible in practice, rather than in variation, as the lithographic process favors identical reproductions.<p>In my estimate, Broadcom is on the cusp of reaching a sublime point I&#x27;ve seen in other, unnamed semiconductor companies, at which the number of combinations and revisions of IP within a family of chips becomes difficult to account for.<p>So, it&#x27;s really not even a question of git being overkill - it&#x27;s a question of whether its source code will persist over many times the length of the proejct.

My advice: Avoid doing what I did and don&#x27;t apply for your first current account online. It might seem more efficient and time-saving but it&#x27;s actually not - because of your non-existent credit history in the UK - they will have to ask you for endless documents.<p>Once you&#x27;re in the UK, walk into a high-street bank that is actively seeking customers. Lloyds Bank or Barclays comes to mind. Ask for a basic bank account, which they will open for you without proof of address. Make an appointment with the same bank for a startup current account - sometimes they will send you to a different branch - if they don&#x27;t do business banking themselves.<p>They will ask you about your business and estimated turnover. Make sure you bring your incorporation documents.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that I&#x27;m the only director of my limited company and the companies registered office was my home address - so no further proofs of address were required.<p>Waiting for your cards to arrive in the mail is what takes the most time, but I was able to use my online banking account even before I had my card.",1445173035

When we returned to drop her off, the scale of the damage where the tornado ripped through Tuscaloosa was astonishing.

And there was a surprisingly small interface between the &quot;completely destroyed&quot; areas and &quot;untouched&quot; areas.<p>By the time she graduated this May, the damage has been cleared away but the path of this tornado is still visible.

Not every student learns the same way, and not every single one will write perfect code every step of the way. But they are smarter than you think, and you can learn logic and critical thinking on your own. (Though a good teacher wouldn’t hurt)<p><i></i>TL;DR: Want better teachers??<i></i>\nRaise their salaries and respect them professionally, like some countries in southeast Asia and Japan do. Don’t let parents tell teachers that the teacher should have given them a perfect A+, and their corn-flake special child is perfect and isn’t understood by the rest. Teacher, after all, are professionals trained in the art of education, child psychology, etc. Reduce the amount of bureaucracy, or completely reboot the public school system by some disruptive measure.<p>-- My full arguments here \nI think your arguments are on the right track, and I agree that (very) critical thinking should definitely be part of a school&#x27;s (heck, even federal) curriculum, but in practice, I think mayor&#x27;s De Blasio&#x27;s program (<a href=""http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/education-vision-2015-computer-science.page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/education-vision-201...</a>) is a good policy to effect the kind of change we want to see.<p>As someone who has gone through the public education system in the United States, Argentina, and Israel, whose parents are (still) high school teachers, whose wife was a public school teacher, I can tell you first-hand that most school teachers get paid a really crappy salary; in New York City (see charts <a href=""http://schools.nyc.gov/nr/rdonlyres/eddb658c-be7f-4314-85c0-03f5a00b8a0b/0/salary.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://schools.nyc.gov/nr/rdonlyres/eddb658c-be7f-4314-85c0-...</a> and <a href=""http://www.uft.org/files/attachments/secure/teacher-schedule-2009-2018.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uft.org/files/attachments/secure/teacher-schedule...</a> ), the starting salary is $45,000 annual, and the current ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM (22 years of experience with a bachelors and a masters degree) is $100,049. There are some ridiculous things about this chart, including the fact that it&#x27;s set UNTIL freakin&#x27; 2018.<p>Teacher often barely get a 1% salary raise (on a good year), and, to make things worse, are the only professionals in the US where the government tells them exactly what they should teach each day, every day, only so kids could pass some standardized national test (see: the No Child Left Behind act that Bush gave us).<p>Don&#x27;t forget that these are just salaries, in New York city, which are unusually high for the rest of the United States. Look up Texas -- the starting salary is $27,540 (<a href=""http://tea.texas.gov/Texas_Educators/Salary_and_Service_Record/Minimum_Salary_Schedule/2014-2015_Minimum_Salary_Schedule/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tea.texas.gov/Texas_Educators/Salary_and_Service_Reco...</a>), which is hovering near the poverty line in the United States. And yes, some schools actually give teachers these salaries (usually in more rural areas). Compare that to the average threshold of poverty(<a href=""https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/about/overview/measure.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/about/overview/measu...</a>) in the US, and you will be embarrased to live in this country, and awed.<p>That means that, those really smart people you want to be teaching your future children are going to, by an large, opt-out and become lawyers, doctors, or, case-in-point software developers, but not teachers.<p>I have seen this at every step of my education, where my teachers often told me that I had a lot of potential, but they often failed to really challenge and in the math and logic department. \n(e.g.: If it hadn&#x27;t been for my middle-school physics class in Argentina (Jesuit schools for the win), I would have failed college physics, because my public US high school teacher couldn&#x27;t really teach it.)<p>This is why private and charter schools exist. The US public school system is cyclical with its policy (more testing, 10 years pass, do less testing), slow to move, inefficient, beaurocratic, and by and large broken. Even Zuckerberg tried to donate some money recently, and I believe it didn&#x27;t really work out very well in that regard.<p>But hey, some of us made it out of there and did okay.<p>On the flipside: English teachers (in my experience) generally do a good job at teaching critical thinking and writing because there is a large number of people with degrees in the language arts, so there&#x27;s plenty of healthy competition there. Not so many CS graduates go straight into teaching.<p><i></i>-- Arie Litovsky, Co Founder of Teaching Table [@arie_speaks](<a href=""https://twitter.com/arie_speaks)**"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/arie_speaks)**</a>",1445172458

Our diets are largely wasteful around the world as well, it is possible to live on much less food than the typical American eats, for example. And as for space, the world average population density per land is actually not that high; certain places are, but when spread out, there is tremendous room for physically placing more people.

So at higher levels you don&#x27;t see the huge latencies due to compaction because <i>all records are deleted</i>. Knowing that keys are only incrementing could also lead to a simple optimization: the compaction phase can be a simple concatenation of files.<p>So you get an append-only system that progressively removes older entries as they are deleted without resorting to mad science hackery [1]. Why didn&#x27;t it work for InfluxDB ? All I can guess is that individual entries for each series are all mixed together (InfluxDB wants to be able to manage many series with many tags) and older entries are not deleted as frantically, so you get the latencies we all know with compaction and unpredictable reads.<p>Now, this is purely theoretical and of course further experimentations are needed to make sure this is correct, but LSM is in my opinion a correct pattern here.<p>[1] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/CAFxX/571a1558db9a7b393579"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/CAFxX/571a1558db9a7b393579</a>",1445171134

In the &quot;Smoothed&quot; picture the noise is removed but the results are blocky.<p>The first way to deal with it is to take into account higher powers of the differences, e.g. using a linear combination p-norms or a Huber function.<p>The second way is to take into account second order differences. This promotes piecewise affine instead of piecewise constant functions. You can go further and look at third order differences, but the improvement is minimal.<p>Other than being more complex, the biggest downside is that all of these methods have some new parameter(s) to tune.",1445169925

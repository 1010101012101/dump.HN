I had a very low opinion of TCL, basically because it wasn't Lisp. It looks a tiny bit like Lisp, but semantically it isn't, and it's not as clean. Then someone showed me an ad where Sun was trying to hire somebody to work on TCL to make it the “de-facto standard extension language” of the world. And I thought, “We've got to stop that from happening.” So we started to make Scheme the standard extensibility language for GNU. Not Common Lisp, because it was too large. The idea was that we would have a Scheme interpreter designed to be linked into applications in the same way TCL was linked into applications. We would then recommend that as the preferred extensibility package for all GNU programs.</i><p>[1]<a href=""http://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.html</a>",1297868074

When you open many tabs in Chrome or IE they become as slow as FF with perhaps 5-10 times more tabs.<p>While performance generally isn't a field where FF does a good job, I think reliability of FF is unmatched by other browsers despite the dirty tricks with tabs.

Hence the terms you hear thrown around like ""Delaware Corporation,"" etc.   You just need to incorporate in one state, but then some (maybe all) other states just require you to file certain paperwork (and possibly pay some fees) if you intend to do business in their state.   If you're doing a webapp though, I don't think anybody really tries to enforce making you register in every state where somebody might try to use your app.  But if you're selling a product you might run into sales tax issues, see Amazon's battles with North Carolina, Texas and some other states.<p>All of that said, the act of incorporating - in and of itself - isn't terribly expensive.  IF you pay a laywer to do it for you, I've heard prices thrown around anywhere from $500.00 to $1000.00, but some lawyers who specialize in working with startups might do it for equity or on a deferred basis.  Ask around.<p>If you do it yourself, it can be done for basically whatever the fee is to the State.  I organized as an LLC in North Carolina, did all the paperwork myself, and it cost me like $200.00 or so.  The downside to an LLC is that I'll have to reincorporate later if I get outside funding, but I figure if I reach the point where somebody wants to invest, then it'll be worth it to reincorporate as a traditional C corporation then.

The new wave of ""probablistic everywhere"" NLP models, though even the very simplest strictly dominate older grammatical methods, are not often capable of taking advantage of a lot of the structure of language and topic that humans are wont to do. It's a cutting-edge accomplishment when NLP algorithms learn prediction of long-range word pairs such as how you almost certainly will see ""law"" or ""marriage"" somewhere in a sentence containing the word ""annulled"" even if that local area of the sentence doesn't seem to call for it. Humans on the other hand are more likely to forget that it's possible to annul pretty much anything else.<p>I don't own a TV and plan on watching the Jeopardy match later online, so I'm just going to guess about Watson's performance.

2226384,comment,2221831,2224864,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> You mean like satisfying current internet standards and meeting the draft standards head on<p>Well, yes, actually. I just think Apple's failure to support Flash and Google's overtly political decision to drop H.264 support are far more relevant to real users  <i>today</i> than the various emerging technologies that bring the browser one step closer to being an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of an operating system. I just don't see that as the right path to take anyway, and I certainly don't see it as a higher priority than supporting the numerous existing web sites that use Flash or holding up what should be the killer feature of HTML5 for the immediate future.<p>Of course I would prefer that all browsers support all useful standards with complete compliance, but in the real world we have to prioritise to some extent, and I prefer Microsoft's choices at this particular moment in time.<p>> What do you mean by ""performance of the UI slowed"".<p>I haven't diagnosed the problems in detail. I'm just getting bored of waiting several seconds for my browser to start up, one slow-loading tab holding up all the others, horribly slow scrolling on pages with certain CSS styles applied (usually some sort of fixed background), and other obvious delays during routine use. Neither IE nor Chrome exhibits these problems, and Firefox never used to. I realise that it's possible that these delays are actually due to the extensions I use, but there are only a few and they are all very popular ones without which Firefox is seriously lacking in basic functionality, so I don't see much point in distinguishing the core browser from the software I actually use when it comes to the user experience.<p>> You mention running tabs independently (as independent processes presumably) I didn't know that IE8 did this?<p>Actually, IE8 did it first, Chrome did it next, and two years later IE still doesn't do it at all.<p>See, for example, <a href=""http://www.nofullstop.com/2008/09/30/independent-tabs-feature-of-google-chrome-is-copied-from-internet-explorer-8/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nofullstop.com/2008/09/30/independent-tabs-featur...</a>",1297865854

AT&T[2], against the government & AT&T, respectively.<p>Here's the latest news on Jewel v. NSA:<p>> In April, the Obama administration moved to dismiss Jewel, claiming that litigation over the wiretapping program would require the government to disclose privileged ""state secrets,” and that they were immune from suit.<p>According to the documents on the EFF site, they appealed the ruling, but there hasn't been anything posted about the results of that.<p>How about the case against AT&T?<p>> In June of 2009, a federal judge dismissed Hepting and dozens of other lawsuits against telecoms, ruling that the companies had immunity from liability under the controversial FISA Amendments Act (FISAAA), which was enacted in response to our court victories in Hepting. Signed by President Bush in 2008, the FISAAA allows the Attorney General to require the dismissal of the lawsuits over the telecoms' participation in the warrantless surveillance program if the government secretly certifies to the court that the surveillance did not occur, was legal, or was authorized by the president -- certification that was filed in September of 2008. EFF is planning to appeal the decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, primarily arguing that FISAAA is unconstitutional in granting to the president broad discretion to block the courts from considering the core constitutional privacy claims of millions of Americans.<p>0: <a href=""https://www.eff.org/issues/nsa-spying"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/issues/nsa-spying</a><p>1: <a href=""https://www.eff.org/cases/jewel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/cases/jewel</a><p>2: <a href=""https://www.eff.org/nsa/hepting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/nsa/hepting</a>",1297865533

Let's see what happens.<p>I wish people wouldn't be so quick to judge them now that the strategy's out.

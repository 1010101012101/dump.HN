When I say short term I mean that you are in the process of proving a concept as viable and at the point that pivots are not very costly. If you've reach 1% penetration in a large market then you are past this point.<p><i>1% is an excellent number in this context.</i><p>I would definitely agree that it is a good target to hit. I'm just saying that it should not be your golden standard. There is a difference between saying ""this is how we plan on securing a foothold in the market"", and saying ""If we can get only 1% of the market then we will be successful.""<p><i>The comical term for this is Scientific Wild-Ass Guess</i><p>I completely agree. Thats why i actually disagree with stating a target marketshare in a pitch. Personally I think that stating total market size, an underserved aspect of that market/competitive advantage and how you plan to try and break into that market should be enough. I don't think making wild guesses at market share is really worth while at all.",1363100349

Perhaps it's a part of the job.<p>""comparative advantage depends on scarcity of productive agents""<p>People buy things (trade) based on <i>perceived value</i>. That perception can be based on perceived scarcity, sentiment, anger, fear, love, happiness -- the list is very long. The scarcity argument only holds true across large industries and populations, and that's only because of the fungibility of money and the fact that material goods are (rather) easily categorized. It's not going to continue working. Money will stay fungible, but we're going to see an explosion in the kinds of things that have perceived value that the world has never seen.<p>Which makes sense if you think about it: as mankind has progressed, the diversity of the things he trades has increased. This trend will continue.<p>You guys are confusing theory and reality. Macro-economics fails us here. That's a shame. Looks like some folks have more work to do :)",1363100338

I remember I was testing between Paranoid Android [3] and it's expandable notifications [4]/ hybrid mode [5], Omega[6] with it's standard TouchWiz two apps at once feature (multiview) [7] and all the other TouchWiz features (gestures and popup browser--which I didn't really use), and Super Nexus [8] with it's pure vanilla Android experience on my I9300 (Samsung Galaxy S3) before sticking to CM and Android will sync my Google Contacts and Gmail first and fast.<p>Google Now is great by being proactive like the author said but he forgot to mention sports tracking for those who like sports.<p>Other than pushing apps from the market to the phone while you're at your PC, the chrome to phone extension [9], and the share feature [10] he nailed this list.<p>EDIT: Forgot about setting apps to default. On paper Android seems better but it's still a matter of polished skuemorphism and flat UI / extra MB added from HTC Sense, BLUR or TouchWiz.

I thought the best response to that story was to look up some other information on the same topic and to post that in a comment, and to upvote all of the other comments that were well informed about the topic. (I try to upvote every good comment I find in any thread. The single best way we can improve the quality of HN is by upvoting the good stuff more.)<p>Because I have read all the comments that were here as I posted this comment, I should perhaps respectfully disagree with some of the ideas expressed in the comments. I asked once soon after I joined HN (probably about early 2009) whether stories should be submitted for disagreement. The consensus then was NO, if a submitter of a story thinks the story is dubious, the story shouldn't be submitted at all. Submitting a story is an endorsement of some aspect of the story's content and its treatment of the topic. I flag stories that are low-quality stories. In my experience, such stories rarely produce good threads of comments.

This is indeed vulnerable to contamination, since the compounds could be deposited on at any time.<p>In the case of diatoms, they were looking for fossilized structures embedded in the rock. These aren't subject to contamination (at least not trivially), because contamination would have to actually change the structure of the rock.<p>The results for both are wrong -- we didn't find life -- but in principle the methods of looking are subject to different kinds of errors.<p>In this case, the issue is that the author of the original paper has done two major things wrong:<p><pre><code>    - He hasn't shown that the meteor is actually a meteor.
    - What he claims to be fossils embedded in the rock aren't fossils.</code></pre>",1363096944

The earliest diatoms we've found are from  185 million years ago, and they are believed to have arisen around 250 million years ago.<p>So even assuming that the earliest life on Earth included diatoms, that leaves over 3 billion years between the earliest specimens observed and these hypothetically original specimens.

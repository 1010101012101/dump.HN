679043,story,,,1,0,mbellinaso,"Use your own photos to print and send physical postcards",http://www.angurialab.com/apps/,"Hi guys,\nI'd like to introduce you Postino, a new Facebook-based app that lets you create and send (worldwide) physical postcards made with your custom photos (uploaded from the PC or from the Facebook albums) and message. The photo can be cropped, zoomed and positioned inside an optional frame (themes include some seasons, Christam, Ester, kids party, new born, love and more). The app is very straightforward and fast to use (everyting is done via AJAX, so no page reloads and post-backs). You can read more about it at http://www.angurialab.com/apps/postinoweb/<p>There is also an iPhone version (with additional features, such as the ability to send e-cards in addition to phyical cards, draw a signature with your finger on the touchscreen, and include your GPS position with a link to Google Maps) available on the App Store: http://www.angurialab.com/apps/postino/. The cool thing is that you can buy some stamps from either the Facebook or the iPhone version, and then share the stamps between the two apps...so that you use the iPhone while on the go, and Facebook once at home. A Windows Mobile edition is currently being finished and will be released for free.<p>We're launching the Facebook app just now, so if you have a blog and want to write a review about it , it would be very welcome. We would of course be glad to offer some free stamps so that you can fully test it out. In that case contact use at http://www.angurialab.com/contact.aspx",1246287527

Navigation, for example, could only be read out loud when the user requests it instead of every time a page loads.<p>Search engines, when parsing your page, will be able to more easily get a general idea of what the page is about. Right now we can only tell headers, paragraphs, and lists; with HTML5 parsers will be able to not only determine the former, but also which content is more important.<p>The more semantic the markup, the more a machine-parser can figure out about the meaning behind a page.<p>It's the same argument as a mass of divs and spans (or tables!) versus h1s, paragraphs, and dls.<p>Ultimately, not only does it add context to your content, but it makes it easier and more concise to produce the markup: you don't need <div class=""aside""></div> anymore - you just need <aside></aside>.",1246287376

Wasn't sure if it was better to see if we designed the site well enough that people could figure it out without us telling them.<p>Classlet makes handling assignments easier for teachers and students. We've got a whole bunch of features that most of the competitors don't have:<p>1. Students never need to register, only the teacher does\n2. Students never even need to visit the site, they can do everything through email\n3. Anything that can be passive, is. In most other systems, you constantly need to check if you've gotten a grade or if an assignment has been posted. We don't make you check, instead we let you know by email (and working on other channels too)\n4. The teacher can do all of the grading within the web browser. They don't need to download a hundred individual doc files and open each one in word. Instead, they do it all from one page.\n5. We keep a timeline for each student for each assignment. You can see any submissions they've made, if they submitted late, if they submitted an older version, then a newer version (teach has access to all versions), we mark if it was submitted late, etc...\n6. And we try to make it easy to facilitate a discussion between the teacher and student.<p>Those are 6 of quick things off of the top of my head that set us apart from the competition.<p>Thanks for the feedback.",1246287319

We were not accepted, but pg and team encouraged us to keep at it. Their expert opinion? ""[Ultimately] what put us off was the difficulty in selling it to universities. This is one of those cases where existing solutions suck for a reason.""<p>At the time, we both had well-paying fulltime job offers on our desks and graduation was fast approaching.

What makes them worse than most others is their connection to politics, which allows them to get all kinds of favors.<p>If you want to develop a boiling hatred of the investment banking industry, look into how these firms handle IPOs. If the banks were behaving ethically, IPOs would be priced at the company's fair value, meaning that having an allocation in the IPO would have zero expectation. In practice, IPOs are known to be 10-15% underpriced, meaning that the IPOing firm raises less money than it should, while the bank has a positive-expectation allocation it can use to pay favors to clients. Moreover, it's a bad idea for an average Joe to participate in IPOs at all; if you're a nobody, banks will let you in on losing IPOs but never allocate you into the good ones.<p>Another sad truth is that the ""nice"" (in relative terms) investment banks were Lehman and Bear, both of which died. Lehman especially was known for having less of a BSD (not the OS) culture than the other banks. It was also obvious even in late 2007 that these banks would be the first to fail (if nothing else, because they were less prestigious and would be hit first by panic-driven activities) while Goldman had enough of a lifeline to benefit from the inevitable ""stop the bleeding"" measures for which other banks would be too late.",1246285920

True, they are purely anecdotal, but that doesn't mean it's some conspiracy perpetrated by a competitor.<p>Think logically about this. Apple is not infallible. They can and do make mistakes. Glitches are very common in new gadgets and overheating is always a problem when you're dealing with components that generate heat. It's only made more difficult when you're dealing with a small, enclosed device with components tightly packed together. This is a plausible and very familiar story. Could it be possible that some people are having real problems with overheating?<p>If the new iPhones are, in fact, overheating Apple should be called out and given an opportunity to respond.

The whole conception is flawed at the top because people don't read anymore.""<p>For Jobs-watchers, this was a clear indication that he must be planning an e-reader, for Apple's grand poobah is the master of the red herring.

What this means is, you work 3 years in an industry as apprentice (almost full-time).  That's how the talk goes: ""What do you do?"" ""I am making an apprenticeship"".

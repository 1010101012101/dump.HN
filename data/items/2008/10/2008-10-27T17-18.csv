So explain what this 'optimization' for search engines exactly is?<p>Titles? That is for the user.  Sitemaps?  Actually they don't matter as long as your content is linked to internally.  They can be produced trivially anyways if you really feel the need, but Google finds all my pages.  Optimizing flash pages?  That sounds like frowned upon injection.  You should not change the way you write for a search engine.  Have anchor text that represents what you are linking to?  Come on, thats how it should be regardless.  The best thing you can have is backlinks - which good content/interesting sites should naturally develop.<p>I don't know of a single thing you should do to optimize your site for a search engine.  edit: If you are downmodding me be because this is incorrect, speak up.<p>This article is clearly garbage though.",1225130212

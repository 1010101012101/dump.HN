Its a disruptive innovation. It just guts the current business model.<p>Wouldn't it be better if people never had to go into the hospital in the first place? Aside from the supplemental costs - ""surgical complications increase the margin the hospital makes on the patient by 330 percent for the privately insured and 190 percent for Medicare patients."" - consider the quality of life issues.<p>If Medicare is concerned with scaling this program up from a couple thousand people, instead of completely cutting a program which has proven its ability to cut costs AND improve quality of life, why not try it with five or ten thousand people first? If that works, then try it with 20 thousand people, then 50 thousand. If it doesn't scale at that point, then cut it.<p>Another possible solution is to find a way to eliminate the for-profit hospitals. But Medicare's solution - ""Its pushing providers to band together into accountable care organizations, or ACO, that get a flat fee for all care related to a patient."" - sounds destined to fail from the outset to this layman.",1367157276

I would paraphrase the author's point as, hey, we've been told that the Internet provides a new way for an artist to communicate directly with her fans, and so it does; but it doesn't change the fact that even a message intended only for one audience will nonetheless be judged by another. Consider the recent sorority girl email that went viral, or the myriad of leaked sexts. The same connectedness that makes it easy to create targeted messages makes it just as easy to rebroadcast them to everyone. If the sorority girl had sent a letter 40 years ago, someone might've made copies and circulated them on campus but that's as far as it would've gone.

5621218,comment,5613603,5613792,1,0,VLM,,,"""one day I'll binge through them all""<p>I watched all the star trek series when they were new, on live TV.  A couple years ago I did the torrent + binge thing you're describing and the experience IS dramatically different.<p>Even merely watching commercial free downloads dramatically changes the apparent pacing of the story, if the original intention was to have a dramatic pause while you think for awhile.  You're supposed to think for an hour of realtime not just 45 minutes.  Sometimes I wonder if there are any ""distros"" of TV shows out there on torrent sites with ""intermission"" screens instead of simply editing out commercials.  It would be a weird, possibly interesting experience.<p>On a longer scale the very best episodes probably need a couple days to consider, digest, contemplate.  Something like ""space hippies"" is probably best forgotten as quickly as possible, but ""Doomsday Machine"" (and several others) resulted in a bit of thinking after viewing the episode.  Its not the finest of literature, but if you're going to invest the time, you owe it to yourself to get the most you can out of the substantial time expenditure.<p>If you binge and hit ""spocks brain"" or some other awful episode during a binge you might be completely derailed and stop, but if its ""the thing you go every thursday at 7pm or saturday at 4pm or whatever"" then you won't be permanently derailed.  Don't let ""space hippies"" during a binge prevent you from seeing ""city on the edge of forever"".<p>On the other hand there is a sort of blurry trippy coolness rush about staying awake for 24 hours watching the entire cardassian war story arc on DS9 or something like that.  Everything seems weird and cool and interesting when you're sleep deprived, even if its probably not what the director intended.  This is pretty good evidence that coding at 3am is probably results in poor taste results, unless you woke up at 5pm or something.",1367157071

Period. \nMaybe you are confused because they often say these are not searches? For example, you will read that doing helicopter flyovers, even when looking in people's fields, is reasonable (which at the time, meant it wasn't a violation of the subject's reasonable expectation of privacy), and thus, not considered a search that is subject to the rest of the 4th amendment.

Sometimes not revealing those mistakes (lying, if you will) let you grow through it. Someone might conceal a mistake for life, or reveal it after time has passed, or confess immediately. Unless there's a law enforcement agency trying to get at the truth, I think it's best left up to an individual how to deal with everyday mistakes.<p>And they are everyday mistakes, because that's our nature.<p>We're dealing with this issue already in our schools. It used to be if two kids fought in the halls, a teacher or principle would deal with it. Suspension at most, rarely expulsion. The school would almost never bring the matter to the attention of law enforcement except in rare cases. But it's against the law to fight, and they concealed it from law enforcement.<p>Now police are often stationed in schools. My kid's high school, and the middle school before that, has a dedicated officer. And he has said if he sees you breaking the law he'll arrest you. Do we need more kids contacting the justice system, for doing what kids do as they outgrow being kids? It's the truth, but is it right?<p>Do you ever spell check or read over what you've written before you submit writing? Shouldn't the computer stream everything as written, so everyone would know the truth about your spelling, grammar and judgment?<p>I look out the window and I see a lot of color.

If I hack your laptop and use your valid credentials to log in to a site, even if you log in just to disable the audit logging, there will at least be one entry of that happening somewhere.

I've lived in east Asia, and once upon a time, I thought that there was a generation of Americans who had all heard of the Opium Wars and understood the historical context of why several countries in that part of the world want nothing to do with their common people having access to most drugs. Harsh drug laws in some places--including the death penalty for what seems to Americans like dealing rather small amounts of drugs--is a reaction to a historical experience in which whole countries were ruined by foreign drug dealers (British imperialists trading in opium) and their local agents. I'm not personally in favor of the death penalty for all drug dealers, but I can empathize with (for example) a parent of a child who started using drugs who would want the child's dealer in prison for the rest of his life or even dead.<p>Of course we want to look to other countries for historical examples too.

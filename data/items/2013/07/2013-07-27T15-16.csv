The solution is never to &quot;exclude&quot; or &quot;ban&quot; a school of thought, but counteract it with logic and reason. I see no harm in teaching both sides of human origin, it gives children the chance to decide for themselves, and also offers parents a wonderful opportunity to explain their own beliefs while rebutting any they don&#x27;t agree with.<p>If a teacher is not teaching evolution perhaps they aren&#x27;t performing their job correctly, as opposed to being an insidious agent that must be removed due to their crimethink. I hope you can see the difference between job performance and belief systems.",1374940744

But I am also discouraged by how, when reading academic scientists and academic journals (_Nature_ in this case), it seems considerably easier to find concern about unscientific nonsense beloved of the right than about unscientific nonsense beloved of the left.<p>E.g., individual genetic heritability is even more fundamental and even more loudly supported by obvious evidence than evolution by natural selection. Yet not only is this sometimes slighted in the high school curriculum, one can find academic work from prestigious institutions that pretends heritability does not exist (or is at least, for some unexplained reason, absolutely negligible). See, e.g., Chan and Boliver &quot;The Grandparents Effect in Social Mobility&quot;, <a href=""http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfos0006/papers/asronline.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfos0006/papers/asronline.pdf</a> (HT <a href=""http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/a-grandparent-effect/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/a-grandparent-effect/</a>). It is not easy (for this reader with a BS in Biology) to see why it&#x27;s scientifically OK to assume that heritability is negligible at the level of detail considered by Chan and Boliver (&quot;if mobility follows a first-order Markovian process&quot;; &quot;well-connected grandparents could also use their social contacts to help grandchildren with job searches&quot;; citations into a more than a decade of research on multigenerational issues, e.g. the cite to Bengtson).

It&#x27;s just hard to see why scientists wouldn&#x27;t be concerned about this behavior by the BBC and by the academic research community.<p>In general, it&#x27;s sensible for a scientific journal to worry about unscientific claptrap. However, specifically skipping over the unscientific claptrap beloved of their faction in the BBC, in academic science, and in academic journals in order to zero in on the unscientific claptrap of rival factions is unbecoming in an organization that claims to be scientific.

A topic exchange will deliver messages to every queue with a <i>pattern matched</i> routing key.<p>For example, you can bind three queues with routing keys where:<p>queue A = citical.log<p>queue B = warn.log<p>queue C = * .log<p>(Note that there should be no space after the wildcard) Then, when you publish a message to that exchange with the key &quot;warn.log&quot; it be delivered to queue B and C but not queue A. This is nice because you could have queue A sending you texts, calls, emails, bike messengers, etc when it gets a message; queue B just an email; and queue C just logging. Now, you&#x27;re easily getting logging messages where they should go, at the same time.<p>Even better: let&#x27;s say you want to add in a metrics system based on your logs. It&#x27;s dead simple to tap into that log feed and get all of your log messages to process. Just add a new queue:<p>queue D = * .log<p>Now your new queue is getting copies of all of those tasty log messages as well.<p>Another quick example: at Updox we have an API that partners can call to send faxes. Part of this process involves converting the faxes to images for the user to view, building thumbnails, or otherwise heavy processing tasks.<p>Now, for scalability we could load balance more and more full blown web servers, OR we could pass the heavy processing tasks off to a Rabbitmq exchange and have a processing engine pickup those messages and process them. If we do the latter, then to scale we can just add another processing engine and tell it to listen to the exchange!

That makes the entire experience way worse  for example, contacting them is essentially an emergency measure. OTOH, they usually care less about what you do to the flat (so, they&#x27;re more likely to be okay with drilling holes or painting walls into odd colors  if you rent serially, you may have only a week or less between tenants, if you just kick people out and move in yourself you probably take a full redo into account).",1374939076

People here in SA act like its the end of the world if the market appears to flatten or a property takes a few weeks to sell. Not denying that a bubble could exist, but there are always tenants here and land is consistently in demand. The stories of doom are generally anchored to a glut in apartment development and/or Eastern states. Property with land is not so susceptible with ever-rising demand (immigration, investment properties, etc); e.g., my place is 750sqm, I demolished an older house and built new; within two years of buying, the land value alone was $100k up on the original purchase price.",1374938091

6113134,comment,6112861,6112861,1,0,fgoodman,,,"I started programming around a time similar to you, and I also faced many of your challenges. I know this may not be the general opinion, but my opinion is to not worry about starting a web design business. This is a super competitive field, and your age WILL hurt you when it comes to finding clients.<p>That being said, I started working for a web development firm at age 15. I didn&#x27;t have a portfolio and I didn&#x27;t have an impressive interview; I simply knew the right people and was in the right place. I lucked into a great job. I was able to work after school and on weekends, and I&#x27;m still employed at this firm. Working for a firm allowed me to mask my age. I wasn&#x27;t a person; I was a member of a team. I produced the results expected of that team, and clients never once asked my age. I&#x27;d continue networking with people and being active in the community. Eventually, you will find the right opportunity -- sometimes it just takes time. Connections will be your biggest asset as this age. See if you have any family friends who own businesses who might need a website.<p>I never viewed web development as a career, but rather as a job. My passion is computer science, and by working in web development for several years before going to college, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to gain communication skills and work skills. I am currently studying computer science, and I love what I&#x27;m doing. I feel if I was focusing on both computer science and web design, I would be spreading myself too thin. I&#x27;d suggest picking a field of focus, and going full throttle.<p>I&#x27;d suggest spending more time learning and less time trying to start a business, especially if you&#x27;re facing resistance with the business. Running a business is a huge time investment (if you do it right), and this time might better be spent learning at your age. You have the blessing of being at an age with minimal obligations. You should use your free time to learn everything you can. Watch TED talks, read Wikipedia, take online courses, etc. This will broaden your horizons and perhaps open doors for you.<p>Finally, I&#x27;d suggest changing your personal website -- both design and content. I&#x27;m not accusing you of copying (and I&#x27;m not sure who did it first), but your website looks like a direct copy of Macaw&#x27;s sneak peek website -- <a href=""http://macaw.co/peek/sample"" rel=""nofollow"">http://macaw.co/peek/sample</a>. While a fraction of the design community might be the only people who recognize this, it still might give people the wrong idea. Considering you want to be a web designer and a website nearly identical to this was made in a matter of minutes as a demo, you might want to show something unique and reflective of your skills (your case study and your personal site do not look like they came from the same person). For your case study, I&#x27;d suggest explaining why having a site helped this client. Did he go from 0 traffic to 100 unique daily views? Did he go from 100 unique daily views to 1,000 unique daily views? Businesses and clients want to see results.<p>If you have any questions on web design/development at a young age, feel free to respond to this comment and I&#x27;ll do my best to answer.",1374937756

People care <i>too much</i> about what tool is best for a job, and as a result nothing is easily interoperable. One grad student writes stuff in Haskell, another one uses OCaml, a third does everything in Python, a fourth uses Common Lisp, and you&#x27;re lucky if a fifth doesn&#x27;t use his custom, self-maintained Scheme dialect that he swears is <i>perfectly</i> adapted to the job.<p>I&#x27;m not a big Matlab fan, but I do sometimes envy the areas where there&#x27;s a default environment everything is expected to plug in to, whether it&#x27;s Matlab or R or something else (Python, increasingly).",1374937305

So much so that I wonder if they were written with sarcasm that escapes me.<p>They represent a philosophy that is referenced often but always before as an unintentional consequence of our internal laziness -- a laziness that should be fought against. However here it is being presented as a conscious choice. Indeed a right, proper, and good, choice.<p>The commenters seem to be arguing that reading is only worth the time if the content has been distilled to its basic facts, and further that that facts need to be immediately actionable. Have we no room for soul? Do we lack the energy to take general concepts and apply them to new areas in new ways?<p>When we break a larger writing down and extract just the main theses, we make it easier and quicker to under understand, but we also neuter and even change the meaning. Sometimes what we learn or what we experience is subtle. Sometimes writing doesn&#x27;t give us a todo list, but instead it ever-so-gently shades and nudges all our todo lists.",1374937270

As for feeling lost, again it&#x27;s to be expected. There&#x27;s a lot out there. If your serious about programming , learn another language like Java or C#, then move to something like C++ or C. This will expose you to other languages and a different design flow from something like python or javascript. You can also read some books on program designs, data structures, and algorithms. A great place to start would be Code Complete. 
There&#x27;s a lot out there to learn. Take your time and absorb it. Most of all, HAVE FUN DOING IT. Your fourteen, this should be a fun hobby for you. Computers are complex machines that are a lot of fun to play with. If you get frustrated put whatever your doing down and go do something for a while.

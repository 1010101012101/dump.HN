1463714,comment,1463425,1463678,0,0,dhimes,,,"My impression, although I'm not an insider and could be off base, is that it wasn't conceived to be an enterprise language, but its patterns were.  I learned it when I started application programming for my startup (I had been doing scientific routines, i.e. FORTRAN and Mathematica), because I was curious about OO.  A lot had changed since I hacked out a little C and assembler on my Mac+ many years ago, and the scale of the problems programmers and programming teams had to handle had changed significantly.  It seemed OO became popular as a way to handle this scale of things.  Java was presented as a solution for building maintainable apps, so I learned it.<p>I also tried to stay close to the OO paradigms (of course, I was just learning them), as I built this 50000 line beast called ""Egorg.""  Now, I get to maintain and update it, so we'll see if it paid off.<p>On a side note, I have a real distaste for objects in Javascript.  They seem clunky, almost like they were stuck on as an afterthought (I get a similar feel about Generics in Java).  But the design of Javascript makes it quite easily to hammer out a script to do something cool.  I'm worried about maintenance, though, because I feel like I'm evolving my own design patterns, so retracing my steps will likely be painful.<p>You are correct about the IDE thing.  That does ease a large burden in Java.",1277562525

Both companies were destroyed because the deal they struck, at the dawn of packaged personal computer software, gave SA too much money.

I had a similar experience as you in that I went from C->C++->Java->Javascript->Scheme->SML->Python. I can definitely tell you that learning Scheme and SML first helped me tremendously in understanding dynamic languages in general. In more concrete terms, understand typing rules has helped me how to debug a program when I mess up in Python. For example, in SML, I can completely omit type annotations and the interpreter will infer the right type for me at parse-time, and that each function or statement must only return 1 type.<p>In dynamic languages such as Python, you can still do what you can do in SML or Haskell, but the runtime system makes no guarantee that your program as it is written is type-safe when the interpreter parses all your source files. Type checking is done at execution, when the code path in question is exercised. However, if you THINK about how the types are infered in SML when you write in Python, you generally will not run into TypeErrors.<p>The same goes for functions that return different types. To prevent tripping up with these functions, just apply what you've learned in Haskell or SML when you are debugging library functions that do this, and avoid writing functions that return different types.",1277562323

To draw that map to the screen, I might do something like the following:<p><pre><code>  for(int x = 0; x < grid.length;    x++) {\n  for(int y = 0; y < grid[0].length; y++) {\n  	drawTile(grid[x][y], x * tileWidth, y * tileHeight);\n  }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThere are other ways to refashion this as a single loop, (storing everything in a 1d array and handling the dimensioning ourselves, using an iterator and giving tiles a position attribute containing their (x,y) coordinates, etc) but is any of that really more straightforward?<p>Again, I am not arguing for indentation anarchy, merely that there are times when it can help to bend the rules.<p>edit:\nI imagine you'd prefer something like this?<p><pre><code>  for(int t = 0; t < grid.length * grid[0].length; t++) {\n  	int x = t % grid.length;\n  	int y = t / grid.length;\n  	drawTile(grid[x][y], x * tileWidth, y * tileHeight);\n  }</code></pre>",1277562303

It was ""ok"".<p>I think if they are serious about penetrating the network security market, they'll need all new technology that can be used in real time.

Time to be an insensitive East Coaster for a minute...<p>At what point do we start expecting members of society to toughen up or start considering their sensitivity/anxieties symptoms of psychological issues requiring clinical treatment?<p>An iPhone app for catcalling?!?!?!<p>Let me lead this debate right off with: yes, I understand there are instances of street harassment that occur which are tragic, illegal, senseless, violent and I firmly agree all of those should be stopped.<p>But for the sub-tragedy-level issues of &#x27;street harassment&#x27;: really?!<p>Here&#x27;s a solution: Empower yourself!<p>If you&#x27;re worried about physical harassment, carry a taser/pepper spray/knife/gun. Start working out. Take a self-defense class.<p>If you&#x27;re worried about psychological harassment, take a good hard look at yourself and your life and work on your self-esteem, see a therapist, work out (two birds, one stone, with that). Figure out how to look in the mirror and be confident in what you see, no matter what others say (it may be hard, I know, but no one can do this for you but you).<p>Do all of those things, and you&#x27;ll surely walk around with far less fear of &#x27;street harassment&#x27;. In fact, I&#x27;m fairly confident the majority of people with such anxieties who employ the above tactics will find much help for their problems.<p>Encouraging people to use an iPhone app to remedy this will only perpetuate the cycle of helplessness in society.<p>Put bluntly: do you think some drunk idiot on the street who&#x27;s catcalling you cares that you&#x27;re writing him a bad Yelp review on your iPhone app? No.<p>Does an iPhone app fortify your psyche or physical security? No.<p>I&#x27;m totally sympathetic to unchangeable things people suffer from in life (physical disease, psychiatric disabilities). But to the extent that is possible, you should always seek to empower yourself. And an iPhone app does nothing (long-term) to empower your psyche or physical security.

After using them in Scala, traits are also a nice plus to have in PHP. I do use PHP less than I used to, opting for Python more as it has more uses than PHP does (PHP can be used with GTK or CLI, but no thanks) outside of the web.<p>There are also quite a few good libraries and frameworks out there for PHP, although they&#x27;re hard to find if you&#x27;re not already experienced in PHP and can filter out the horrible ones by reading their code. Compared to Python, the task of finding quality code is generally harder from all the existing stuff out there holding on to bad hacks from PHP 5.2 and before (as well as long time PHP developers abusing such bad hacks out of habit).<p>Also, in PHP, trying to do anything event related with server to client notifications[1] comes down being an ugly hack[2] unless you want to use some third party PHP extensions like libevent[3] or offload to another language/service you could have just written everything in to begin with. PHP is just not built for anything unconventional like that and makes your life a headache if you ever find you need it at some point. Screwing with all of that is way more of a pain than just using Python with Tornado or Twisted, using Node.js or something like Play 2.0 with Scala. For what it&#x27;s worth, the MySQLi native driver/api supports non-blocking async queries to the DB at least now and the native PostgreSQL API does as well (albeit the PgSQL API is not Object Oriented and I resorted to wrapping it a class that mimicked the MySQLi Object Oriented API for consistency).<p>[0] <a href=""http://marc.info/?t=132988607800003&r=1&w=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marc.info/?t=132988607800003&r=1&w=3</a> (lots of futile rants about it here). Basically comes down someone rejecting enum because they claim it&#x27;s &quot;redundant&quot; (though PHP has plenty of previously accepted redundancies) when you can fake them with classes (which is not true as you cannot use them in a switch [without faking with toString()] and cannot use them without instantiating an object). The other excuse is it would introduce &quot;strict typing creep&quot; to PHP, which is silly, since you can already type hint on functions by including a the class or array type in each parameter (and will even throw an error if using the incorrect type). Excuses are not surprising though, given the news the past month of how toxic the core developer mailing list is for PHP.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ajaxpatterns.org/HTTP_Streaming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajaxpatterns.org/HTTP_Streaming</a><p>[2] To implement in PHP without event listeners, you have to use some sketchy third party php based http servers instead of fcgi+fpm for those parts or fake it with an infinite loop + sleep and use nginx + http push stream (<a href=""http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpPushStreamModule"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpPushStreamModule</a>)<p>[3] <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/book.libevent.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://php.net/manual/en/book.libevent.php</a>",1379129068

If you don&#x27;t have skills, capital, or the cash to survive when your gamble doesn&#x27;t pay off (just like it usually doesn&#x27;t pay off in Silicon Valley), you don&#x27;t get to be a businessman.

This is something of a special case, and hardly a situation that reflects the broad sweep of common law. But even here, there&#x27;s recognition that something really awful and abusive is going on. California has already taken steps to curb the worst of it in ways that conform with existing laws and constitutional protections for the press.

6384492,comment,6382963,6384067,2,0,skwirl,,,"This is just wrong.<p>First, you are implying that Tor has an official Tor e-mail service, which it does not.  Tormail is/was just a basic e-mail service someone not associated with the Tor project was hosting on the deep web.  For all anyone knows, Tormail itself could have been run by the FBI or NSA or whatever all along.  Anyone who thought Tormail guaranteed them anonymity was a fool, much like anyone who kept Javascript enabled while browsing the deep web was a fool.<p>Second, Tormail wasn&#x27;t itself targeted.  What was targeted was the hosting provider that was hosting 95% of child pornography in the deep web, and that hosting provider also happened to host Tormail and a bunch of other non child pornography websites.<p>Conspiracy theories will abound, of course, but keep in mind that the NSA&#x27;s MO is not to disrupt communication but to intercept it.  If the government&#x27;s real concern here was with Tormail, they would have simply kept it around and tapped it, since they had clearly compromised the hosting provider&#x27;s boxes and could have done so.  They wouldn&#x27;t have shut it down and just sent people fleeing to the dozens of other supposedly anonymous and secure e-mail services out there, including ones that perhaps they haven&#x27;t yet compromised.",1379127830

They exist for a reason.<p>Think about this: I can see from the linked page that you understand how adding <i>type=&quot;password&quot;</i> to an <i>input</i> makes some consumers, like various web browsers, treat that field differently.

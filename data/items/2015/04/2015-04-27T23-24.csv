I have a 1080p projector but there is NO WAY anymore for me to play HD movies that I PAID FOR using it, because it doesn&#x27;t support DHCP in the latest way. So I am simply prevented from watching movies in HD on my home theater system. How do I get around it?

That&#x27;s for music. I also buy some music via bandcamp. As for streaming services, I was an early Spotify-user -- and the experience was pretty bad: it was a roulette to see how much was left of any given playlist each time I logged on. To be fair, Spotify has gotten better, but they don&#x27;t have anywhere &quot;all&quot; music I want to listen to. As far as I know Apple don&#x27;t serve my platform (Linux) in any reasonable way. And at any rate, if you need two or more services for &quot;all you can eat&quot;, it&#x27;s no longer &quot;all you can eat&quot;, it&#x27;s a mess. And you&#x27;d need third party apps to creat playlists that cover the content you want.<p>As for tv series and movies, Amazon has some, Netflix has some, HBO has some. Many independent/international movies can&#x27;t be found in either place. Amazon won&#x27;t (legally) let you watch all content outside of the US -- so I could pay for Amazon prime, and use a proxy to circumvent the geo-proteciton -- but then I&#x27;d still be breaking copyright law.<p>For the hypothetical user (ie: not me) that lives in the US -- is there really a service that provides access to both national tv series, as well as foreign-language content?<p>All that said, I&#x27;m sure a lot of people simply enjoy getting stuff for free. But at least for me, the freedom to lend a copy of a good show I watched a couple of years ago to a friend is at least as important as the &quot;no cost&quot; bit.<p>As mentioned, if you give me access to high-quality (encoded) content without DRM, I&#x27;m willing to pay for it. If not, you&#x27;re simply charging for an inferior product.",1430179023

The destructor itself isn&#x27;t unsafe, but it was being used as a guard to enforce the safety of the threading code.<p>> <i>I can easily imagine another situation where a programmer assuming a safe destructor is always called causes a bug, which is exactly the problem with thread::scoped.</i><p>There&#x27;s a difference between &quot;a bug&quot; and &quot;memory unsafety&quot;. If the bug is that the value the destructor guards isn&#x27;t released (for example, if a File is leaked, the associated file descriptor will never be flushed and closed), then that&#x27;s not Rust&#x27;s problem. The programmer probably wanted that file descriptor to be closed, but there&#x27;s no memory safety violations going on there, and in fact nothing worse than simply stuffing that File into a global array/hashtable and forgetting about it.<p>The problem with thread::scoped is actually fairly unique. The destructor is not doing much besides just calling join() on the forked thread. The problem is that the JoinGuard object doesn&#x27;t actually control any access to anything at all, it exists purely as a <i>proxy</i> to represent any values (particularly stack values) that are borrowed by the forked thread. Because it&#x27;s only a proxy, leaking the guard does not actually make the guarded values inaccessible.<p>I can&#x27;t think of any situation besides multithreading that has this same problem. Every other situation involving a RAII object with a lifetime being leaked (and therefore outliving its lifetime, which is technically a violation of borrowck) by definition makes the object <i>inaccessible</i>, which means the data it&#x27;s protecting cannot be reached. For example, a struct that contains a &-ref to some value may outlive the referenced value if the struct is leaked, but this is still memory-safe because the reference will <i>never be dereferenced</i>. If the reference can be dereferenced, that means code exists that has visibility on the struct, which means the struct hasn&#x27;t actually been leaked yet, and as long as it hasn&#x27;t been leaked it&#x27;s still safe (e.g. because borrowck will still enforce the lifetimes).<p>Multithreading is special because the forked thread is what&#x27;s actually accessing the values, without ever going through the RAII object. This means that borrowck cannot guarantee that the RAII object is still alive (and therefore that the &quot;protected&quot; values are still valid). This was considered to be ok as the RAII object would join the thread (therefore ensuring it had finished executing) before destructing, but the ability to leak objects means the join may not happen.<p>Ultimately, this means that JoinGuard is the moral equivalent of a Mutex that coexists with its protected data rather than owning it (thereby making it possible to write code that accesses the data without holding the lock). It&#x27;s a bit better than that, because you have to actually go to some effort to leak the JoinGuard as opposed to just doing it accidentally, but the point is that borrowck cannot guarantee that the code that accesses the data does not outlive the guard.<p>And all of this comes back to my original point, which is that I can&#x27;t think of another situation where it&#x27;s actually <i>unsafe</i> to leak the RAII guard (as opposed to merely being a bug) without there being `unsafe` code in the guard itself. Note that the example given for PPYP, Vec::drain_range, uses `unsafe` code in its destructor.",1430176853

People who undergo sex-reassignment surgery do not change from men to women or vice versa. Rather, they become feminized men or masculinized women. Claiming that this is civil-rights matter and encouraging surgical intervention is in reality to collaborate with and promote a mental disorder.</i><p>Article might be behind a subscriber wall for some people:<p>> The government and media alliance advancing the transgender cause has gone into overdrive in recent weeks. On May 30, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services review board ruled that Medicare can pay for the &quot;reassignment&quot; surgery sought by the transgendered—those who say that they don&#x27;t identify with their biological sex. Earlier last month Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said that he was &quot;open&quot; to lifting a ban on transgender individuals serving in the military. Time magazine, seeing the trend, ran a cover story for its June 9 issue called &quot;The Transgender Tipping Point: America&#x27;s next civil rights frontier.&quot;<p>Yet policy makers and the media are doing no favors either to the public or the transgendered by treating their confusions as a right in need of defending rather than as a mental disorder that deserves understanding, treatment and prevention. This intensely felt sense of being transgendered constitutes a mental disorder in two respects. The first is that the idea of sex misalignment is simply mistaken—it does not correspond with physical reality. The second is that it can lead to grim psychological outcomes.<p>The transgendered suffer a disorder of &quot;assumption&quot; like those in other disorders familiar to psychiatrists. With the transgendered, the disordered assumption is that the individual differs from what seems given in nature—namely one&#x27;s maleness or femaleness. Other kinds of disordered assumptions are held by those who suffer from anorexia and bulimia nervosa, where the assumption that departs from physical reality is the belief by the dangerously thin that they are overweight.<p>With body dysmorphic disorder, an often socially crippling condition, the individual is consumed by the assumption &quot;I&#x27;m ugly.&quot; These disorders occur in subjects who have come to believe that some of their psycho-social conflicts or problems will be resolved if they can change the way that they appear to others. Such ideas work like ruling passions in their subjects&#x27; minds and tend to be accompanied by a solipsistic argument.<p>For the transgendered, this argument holds that one&#x27;s feeling of &quot;gender&quot; is a conscious, subjective sense that, being in one&#x27;s mind, cannot be questioned by others. The individual often seeks not just society&#x27;s tolerance of this &quot;personal truth&quot; but affirmation of it. Here rests the support for &quot;transgender equality,&quot; the demands for government payment for medical and surgical treatments, and for access to all sex-based public roles and privileges.<p>With this argument, advocates for the transgendered have persuaded several states—including California, New Jersey and Massachusetts—to pass laws barring psychiatrists, even with parental permission, from striving to restore natural gender feelings to a transgender minor. That government can intrude into parents&#x27; rights to seek help in guiding their children indicates how powerful these advocates have become.<p>How to respond? Psychiatrists obviously must challenge the solipsistic concept that what is in the mind cannot be questioned. Disorders of consciousness, after all, represent psychiatry&#x27;s domain; declaring them off-limits would eliminate the field. Many will recall how, in the 1990s, an accusation of parental sex abuse of children was deemed unquestionable by the solipsists of the &quot;recovered memory&quot; craze.<p>You won&#x27;t hear it from those championing transgender equality, but controlled and follow-up studies reveal fundamental problems with this movement. When children who reported transgender feelings were tracked without medical or surgical treatment at both Vanderbilt University and London&#x27;s Portman Clinic, 70%-80% of them spontaneously lost those feelings. Some 25% did have persisting feelings; what differentiates those individuals remains to be discerned.<p>We at Johns Hopkins University—which in the 1960s was the first American medical center to venture into &quot;sex-reassignment surgery&quot;—launched a study in the 1970s comparing the outcomes of transgendered people who had the surgery with the outcomes of those who did not. Most of the surgically treated patients described themselves as &quot;satisfied&quot; by the results, but their subsequent psycho-social adjustments were no better than those who didn&#x27;t have the surgery. And so at Hopkins we stopped doing sex-reassignment surgery, since producing a &quot;satisfied&quot; but still troubled patient seemed an inadequate reason for surgically amputating normal organs.<p>It now appears that our long-ago decision was a wise one. A 2011 study at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden produced the most illuminating results yet regarding the transgendered, evidence that should give advocates pause. The long-term study—up to 30 years—followed 324 people who had sex-reassignment surgery. The study revealed that beginning about 10 years after having the surgery, the transgendered began to experience increasing mental difficulties. Most shockingly, their suicide mortality rose almost 20-fold above the comparable nontransgender population. This disturbing result has as yet no explanation but probably reflects the growing sense of isolation reported by the aging transgendered after surgery. The high suicide rate certainly challenges the surgery prescription.<p>There are subgroups of the transgendered, and for none does &quot;reassignment&quot; seem apt. One group includes male prisoners like Pvt. Bradley Manning, the convicted national-security leaker who now wishes to be called Chelsea. Facing long sentences and the rigors of a men&#x27;s prison, they have an obvious motive for wanting to change their sex and hence their prison. Given that they committed their crimes as males, they should be punished as such; after serving their time, they will be free to reconsider their gender.<p>Another subgroup consists of young men and women susceptible to suggestion from &quot;everything is normal&quot; sex education, amplified by Internet chat groups. These are the transgender subjects most like anorexia nervosa patients: They become persuaded that seeking a drastic physical change will banish their psycho-social problems. &quot;Diversity&quot; counselors in their schools, rather like cult leaders, may encourage these young people to distance themselves from their families and offer advice on rebutting arguments against having transgender surgery. Treatments here must begin with removing the young person from the suggestive environment and offering a counter-message in family therapy.<p>Then there is the subgroup of very young, often prepubescent children who notice distinct sex roles in the culture and, exploring how they fit in, begin imitating the opposite sex. Misguided doctors at medical centers including Boston&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Hospital have begun trying to treat this behavior by administering puberty-delaying hormones to render later sex-change surgeries less onerous—even though the drugs stunt the children&#x27;s growth and risk causing sterility. Given that close to 80% of such children would abandon their confusion and grow naturally into adult life if untreated, these medical interventions come close to child abuse. A better way to help these children: with devoted parenting.<p>At the heart of the problem is confusion over the nature of the transgendered. &quot;Sex change&quot; is biologically impossible. People who undergo sex-reassignment surgery do not change from men to women or vice versa. Rather, they become feminized men or masculinized women. Claiming that this is civil-rights matter and encouraging surgical intervention is in reality to collaborate with and promote a mental disorder.",1430176483

We have too often insisted on trying to understand him using the default modes of identity politics: as a white, Southern born-again Christian. But Carter was by profession and training an engineer—a disciple of the greatest and most influential engineer in the history of the U.S. Navy, Admiral Hyman Rickover. Rickover, Carter once said, had more influence on him than anyone except his parents. In his literalness, his relentless candor, his practicality, Carter was the Toyota engineer by the side of the road doggedly lecturing us on how to drive the car. Carter’s true nature is puzzling only if we remain rooted in the fantasy that the world we inherit somehow matters more than the world that we chose for ourselves—and that surrounds us, from nine to five, every working day of our adult lives.</i>&quot;",1430175738

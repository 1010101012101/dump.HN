I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m able to resolve this issue myself, but I think that basic income advocates need to be challenged whenever they use misleading argumentation, even if they are ultimately correct.<p>At any income level you can make arguments why their work output would be more/less sensitive to taxation.  We are talking about a difference in a difference (how much one group changes their work in response to tax, vs another) and not absolutes, which complicates matters.  E.g. poor people need the money more, so maybe they are less responsive to marginal tax rates.<p><i>Also, there are some taxes where the disincentive effect is beneficial.

Every city has one, and you can either Google for yours or look them up on the NAMA website. A lot of their websites look like the group may be defunct, but they are mostly still active -- it&#x27;s just that the average age in these groups is going to be like 60, so the sites just don&#x27;t get updated often. (Though most of the younger folks in these groups tend to be software developers, go figure.)<p>Anyway they&#x27;ll have at least one walk every weekend, and if you go on half of them then you&#x27;ll know how to safely identify and cook with most of the basic edibles by fall. You&#x27;ll probably learn a bunch of edible plants as well, especially during the slow season between when the morels finish and when the summer mushrooms start coming up.<p>There definitely are a lot of things that aren&#x27;t commercially viable. But probably even more that just haven&#x27;t been commercialized. E.g. there are tons of foods that are eaten in Asia, Africa, and South America that aren&#x27;t commonly consumed in the U.S., and sometimes that has to be with growing conditions, but more often than not it&#x27;s just a marketing thing.<p>Regardless, what I&#x27;d say is that you&#x27;re not a real foodie unless you own a couple dozen field guides, because at least for the foreseeable future that&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;re ever going to get to try a lot of the best foods available in your area.",1448225424

The PBOC cracked down on this once, and Bitcoin fell from over $1000 to $250.  Now, as of November 2015, it&#x27;s apparently possible to do yuan transfers within China to at least one Bitcoin exchange, which is pushing the price back up.  There was a brief spike to $500 when that suddenly became possible, but the price dropped rapidly back to $320 or so.

Proprietary vendors would simply take all open source code, strip off its authorship and add proprietary features, then &#x27;extinguish&#x27; by leveraging vertical integration and UX to make it &#x27;theirs.&#x27; Independent OSS ecosystems would cease to exist as no-one would <i>dare</i> release open source code... it would just be appropriated without even giving <i>credit</i> to the original author, let alone any form of compensation.<p>Intellectual property law is indeed broken. That brokenness probably starts with a flawed bit of reasoning by analogy; trying to extend the concept of physical property into the intellectual realm is an ugly hack to shoehorn intellectual value creation into ancient frameworks of property and contract law.

In this case the training data is taken from the MS COCO dataset (<a href=""http://mscoco.org/explore/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mscoco.org/explore/</a>). That&#x27;s why, for example, when Kyle points the camera at himself the model says something along the lines of &quot;man with a suit and tie&quot; - there is a very strong correlation between that kind of an image in the data, and the presence of a suit and tie. With such a strong correlation the model doesn&#x27;t have a chance to tease the two concepts apart. A similar problem would come up with an ImageNet model, where a similar image might be classified as &quot;seatbelt&quot;, because there is no Person class there, and shots of people in that pose usually come from the seatbelt class. It happens to be the most similar concept in the data it has seen. Another example is if you pointed the model at trees it might hallucinate a giraffe, since the two are strongly correlated in the data. Or when Kyle points the camera at the ground I&#x27;m fully expecting it to say relatively random things, because I know that those kinds of images are very rare in the training data.<p>In other words, a lot of the &quot;mistakes&quot; are limitations of training data and its variety rather than something to do with the model itself, and it&#x27;s easier to recognize this if you&#x27;re familiar with the training data and its classes and distribution.",1448223365

I&#x27;ve been programming Scheme for close to a decade now after about the same amount of time using Perl, and I&#x27;ve written this to be able to like programming Perl 5 again, when I have reason to use it. It works pretty well for me for that purpose, although I guess I&#x27;m biased.<p>I guess the layout is pretty old-fashioned, and I might have too much text; I&#x27;m trying to cater to people who are not used to functional programming yet, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m achieving that. I guess it&#x27;s also a rather difficult sell when many Perlers prefer to use the upcoming Perl 6 instead, and others decide to leave for a more proper functional programming language implementation.<p>I&#x27;m rather proud that I&#x27;ve managed to base lazy sequences on lazily evaluated linked lists, i.e. based on purely functional principles down to the cells, instead of using iterators as many function libraries for sequences for non-functional languages (like JavaScript or C#) do. Not sure how much it matters in practice, but at least you can write lazy sequences with this the same way you do in Haskell (see fibs and primes examples).<p>There are some good points doing FP in Perl 5 compared to some other non-FP languages (you can do optimized tail-calls pretty cleanly), and some bad points (you have to care about memory handling in some places). I&#x27;ve got ideas how to improve on both fronts but that will depend on the uptake of the project.",1448222838

One fine day, I find it starts working again. Then another day it stops working. Realise that sound stops working after i switch from Ubuntu to Windows. Weird. How does ubuntu have an effect on sound in windows? Google issue and find that its some strange ubuntu driver issue that puts audio driver in a weird state.

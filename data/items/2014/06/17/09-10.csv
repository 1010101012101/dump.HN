While I think estates should be able to protect the rights of the estate for a period of time the fact that no new content can be created by the author should discount extending the protection.

Doing photo walks allowed me to get in touch with different people with the same passion as me, without having to think too much as the way I used to speak. The &quot;walks&quot; allowed me also to walk by with one person at the time, avoiding the awkward moments when you are supposed to talk in a table where all the other people can talk easier than you. I also met a good bro who I still see quite often! And when bored, I could ask him if he wanted to go to the cinema, to have a beer or to see an art exhibition. Few years later we even got into talking to some girls in bars. That didn&#x27;t go too far most of the time, but it helped the self esteem and I could feel better when talking to random people.\nI also started rowing (but you could try another team sport).

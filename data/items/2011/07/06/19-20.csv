Sorry to rain on the parade.<p>The fractional reserve requirement allows the banks to lend multiples of their incoming deposits no matter what the currency.  BitCoin is just another currency, like the dollars.  M1/M2 in circulation is much smaller than the actual money used in the economy.  BitCoin will be the same way.<p>The banks can very well open BitCoin accounts, allowing people to deposit actual BTC.  The bank then lends the BitCoin out in multiple of deposit, like 5BTC lent out for 1BTC deposited.  The BitCoin lent out are not delivered in actual BTC, just some numbers in the borrowers' accounts.  Only when the borrowers withdraw that they get back BTC.  Like the dollar accounts, most people don't withdraw large amount of dollars; they just write checks or wire transfer them.  Same way for the BitCoin accounts.  Thus the debt-leverage economy with BitCoin will arrive.<p>If everyone withdraws from the BitCoin accounts, there would be a run on the bank and the bank won't have enough BTC reserve to meet the demand and collapses.  Banks can put daily withdraw limit like ATM and tell people to write BTC check.  It's just as good as BTC.<p>The digital nature of BitCoin will probably allow people to withdraw more easily and thus lower the possible leverage multiplier.",1309979728

Which is to say, the enthusiastic folks eventually get those who joined begrudgingly involved, everyone has fun for a while, then everyone gets bored and moves on.<p>It's not as if nerds who have SRS PRIVACY CONCERNZ and talk about things like data portability are the only people growing weary of Facebook. An approximate majority of the musicians/DJs/artists I know in real life and on the internet say they hate Facebook but maintain an account for promotional purposes. But they all seem to have really warmed up to Twitter.

Facebook doesn't really have any control over that. And we've seen that the network effect can linger even after the product has effectively failed (Hi MySpace!), so having the network now may not be a reliable indicator that they'll keep it, even in the very near term.<p>And that leaves the product. Which is fine, I guess. Not that bad, not that great. But when Google announces their first real crack at a genuine social network and it has features no one's even talked about yet, and it's cooked directly into their mobile platform running on about 180 Mm devices worldwide [1][2], Facebook's ""awesome"" reply, ""We've got video chat now,"" falls flat.

But mostly no.<p>There <i>has</i> been a strand of 20 cent philosophy that has regarded justification as that which together with truth and belief yields knowledge - if you do that, you're individuating justification in terms of a particular epistemic role, and that so it's a theoretical notion. That might be what you're getting at.<p>But most philosophers nowadays use the notion of 'warrant' for that. So for them, the notion of justification doesn't have that particular theoretical role.<p>Generally, why be interested in a theoretical notion? The fundamental questions in Epistemology are questions like:<p>* What is knowledge?\n* What is justification?\n* Which beliefs are justified?\n* What do we know, and how do we know it?\netc etc<p>Those are the starting points, and they are phrased in English. They use ordinary notions. Given that, no answer to them which first redefines the terms to yield distinct questions is going to suffice as an adequate answer.<p>Philosophers use a lot of technical jargon, and are interested in technical questions. But generally, those questions have pretty clear connections to our ordinary ways of thinking about the world.",1309978843

I&#x27;m unable to say &quot;good C&quot; with a straight face.<p>> I seriously think the C-hater crowd on HN is just disappointed that they can&#x27;t reason well about pointers.<p>Let&#x27;s be (hopefully) pessimistic and assume I&#x27;m a bottom 10th percentile programmer, and assume (I believe optimistically) that every programmer half an iota better than me is physically incapable of writing a single solitary buffer overflow, double free, use-after-free, or other pointer usage related bug.  Perhaps they are robots!<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion that the remaining bottom 10th percentile remains a significant problem and security hazard.  My continued employment with C++ seems to indicate we lack either the technology to detect, or the will to fire, this bottom 10th percentile.  I feel that a hatred of C is a pragmatic step in helping reduce this problem, by reducing the usage of C by my fellow incompetents, by reducing the usage of C in general.  Do you disagree?  (I extend this stance to C++, despite it being my day job.)<p><a href=""http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerabilities-by-types.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerabilities-by-types.php</a><p>Continuing the assumption - I&#x27;m disappointed that I can&#x27;t reason well about pointers.  I&#x27;m a bit more bummed about being in the bottom 10th percentile.

Proposed <i>computer_on_fire()</i> is by far the worst example, the intention of such function is not clear by it&#x27;s name and I would have to look it&#x27;s definition/description to understand what it does.

They seemed to treat their jobs as actual professions rather than as temporary stepping stones to something else.<p>After the bust, companies reigned in their (perhaps overly aggressive) hiring and IT growth, leading to perhaps an over-abundance of recruiting firms.  But at the same time, new recruiting firms emerged staffed by low (no) quality keyword-searching resume-pushing monkeys who would work for peanuts.  Thus, the real recruiting firms cut staff so severely that the remaining few were buried under resumes of all the IT people displaced (let go).<p>Companies still had positions open, even advertising them, but hiring managers were very reluctant to actually fill those positions.  Despite approvals to hire, nobody wanted to take the risk of actually spending the money on more staff.<p>This led to the growth in low skill H1-B labor, which further reduced the need for quality recruiters.  It all became a game of numbers, a race to the lowest common denominator.<p>When that didn&#x27;t produce positive results for industries, corporate management (who could count money but could not judge IT quality) made the next obvious step - offshoring.  This further ruined the environment.<p>Basically there was an 8-10 year dark age in IT (unless perhaps you were in Silicon Valley... I can&#x27;t speak for that).

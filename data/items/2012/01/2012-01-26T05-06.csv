Less than that for most US cities, most chinese cities, most US colleges. In order to think the overall accident rate or suicide rate among these workers is <i>unusually bad</i>, I think one needs to bring in additional assumptions to the effect that what we see is just ""the tip of the iceberg"".",1327557517

Most Python programmers use threads (and let the GIL give them a bit more thread safety than C++ and Java programmers get) or Twisted (with Deferreds).<p>I think you'll write better JavaScript if you know Python because Python encourages you to use named functions instead of lambdas.  JavaScript fanbois get very excited about anonymous functions and overuse them; Python doesn't let you use anonymous functions for anything useful, so you tend to  name things.  (object.method is also nice syntax for working with callbacks.)<p>Anyway, Python and Node feel about the same to me, except for the fact that Python has nicer syntax.",1327557509

Back in the '90s, the problem was Unix interoperability.  There was a solution to Unix interoperability: Posix.  In the future, all Unixen were supposed to converge on Posix, which would be the One True Unix.  Yeah, I know, ha ha fscking ha.<p>Is HTML5 Posix?  If not, why not?  What I see when I look at HTML5 is a giant pile of Javascript APIs, all different, all being feverishly upgraded and extended, in three or four competing browsers.  Has a situation like this ever resulted in a single universally compatible development environment, ever, in computing history?  How is this effort different from that other effort to standardize a giant pile of APIs - Posix?<p>And if not, what do we do about it?",1327556566

That is, things that were once new and shiny, that didn't catch on or really take off ""big time"" for whatever reason, but are waiting for that ""second wind.""  Some things are just ahead of their times anyway.<p>That said, some of what excites me these days:<p>The new batch of programming languages that are coming out / came out recently:  Clojure, Scala, Rust, Go, Fantom, Ceylon, etc.<p>Machine Learning, especially with the availability of a toolkit like Hadoop that prepackages scalable version of many popular algorithms.<p>Technologies for extracting knowledge (with rich semantics) from unstructured data (Apache UIMA, for example).  And on a related note, things like Apache OpenNLP.<p>And I'm still fascinated with the general notion of a ""Digital Nervous System"" for organizations, where the IT systems are really analogous to the human autonomic nervous system.  Bill Gates started hyping up that phrase back in the mid to late 90's (it existed before then, but Gates really got some buzz behind it), but nobody seems to have truly achieved that level of integration and sophistication to this day.<p>Semantic Web technologies are something I have a lot of interest in, and that still excite me as well.<p>I'm really intrigued by the possibilities of applying tools from Network Science and Social Network Analysis to different kinds of problems as well.  It's not <i>strictly</i> programming related, but there's interesting stuff going on in the world of complex dynamic systems and studies of emergent behavior, that could have some impact on computing in days to come.<p>Business Intelligence, Data Mining, Multi-agent Systems, Grid Computing, Swarm Computing, Evolutionary Computation, Reconfigurable Computing, Genetic Programming, Biocomputing, and, hell, even good-old-fashioned AI stuff (logic programming, expert systems, etc) still excite me.

Instead he quickly made a name for himself for being a full-on fraudster of the sociopath kind.<p>Here's a (german) article that sheds some light on his earliest endeavours:<p><a href=""http://www.gulli.com/news/12565-nachruf-guenter-freiherr-von-gravenreuth-2010-02-22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gulli.com/news/12565-nachruf-guenter-freiherr-von...</a><p>The gist is:<p>Kimble started out by running a warez-bbs and dealing calling cards (which was quite common back in that day). Things turned nasty when his BBS got busted. He did not only cooperate with the cops but there-after partnered with an infamous german lawyer to set up traps for other BBS operators and sell them (literally) to the authorities. This went on for years in an organized fashion. From all accounts that I've heard he was not strong-armed into it but rather made money that way and even bragged about it.<p>From there I think the ars article is mostly correct. But I wouldn't like to see him get away with his self-proclaimed ""hacker""-image.<p>In the german BBS-scene of the 90s the hate for him was unrivaled. There were quite a few graphic kimble-related ascii-banners on some post-login screens.",1327555294

Similarly, sometimes a left join + null check performs better than a ""where not exists ()"" subquery, despite them serving identical purposes.<p>If you can change how you phrase a query and get different performance, while keeping the same semantic meaning, your language isn't just leaking, it's <i>hemorrhaging</i>.  It may still be useful, perhaps world-changingly so, but it's a perfect example of the dangers of declarative programming.<p>As to 'try making it in C++': with a library for doing so with as much maturity as SQL?  Sure.  It'd probably be reasonably simple, if more verbose.

Not only does Foxconn make products for a whole host of other tech companies (as others have pointed out), but aren't there factories with terrible working conditions all over China making things for all sorts of Western industries? And what exactly does an explosion have to do with labor conditions in what's been described as a hyper-clean, hyper-organized factory (albeit to the point of overworking their employees)? Sounds like a terrible accident to me.<p>My main point here, though, is that none of this is anything new. Chinese factories are continuing to abuse their workers to increase Western profit margins.

3512972,comment,3509710,3512624,4,0,mindslight,,,"1. The general pathology when people focus on 'One Time Pads' is that they're blinded by the 'absolute security' of that one primitive, and don't think about the security properties of everything else. Breaking your hash function allows a plaintext-knowing attacker to rewrite a message, which is considered a break of your entire system. In other words, your system is only as secure as your hash function.<p>2. Since the general security of a system is contingent upon its easiest attack (even if that attack is somehow 'rarer'), you might as well use that same hash function to create a stream cipher and once again avoid the huge OTP. (which is why it won't be taken seriously)<p>3. Security of actual cryptosystems comes from widespread implementation, study, and abuse. While your system may indeed have stronger confidentiality properties, it most likely will have undetected implementation errors due to it not being widely scrutinized.<p>4. I think the meat of your argument is that BKD (backpack key distribution) is comparable to QKD. I do agree that your comparison is appropriate, but think it says more about QKD than BKD. Quantum key distribution still relies on classical algorithms for authenticating the classical channel (some kind of MAC), and today's QKD products even rely on classical block ciphers, as the QKD-produced keys are quite small.<p>5. I see no benefits to QKD in general. It only works between prearranged (and physically connected!) pairs of parties. Reimplementing the Internet with QKD means the links are secure, but ISPs still see everything. If quantum computing really does ruin the RSA and DLOG parties, there's certainly other public key algorithms.",1327554099

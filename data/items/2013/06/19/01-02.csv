5903308,comment,5898840,5902795,2,0,davidstrauss,,,"> I am intimately familiar with eWLM and I think it&#x27;s quite unfair to call it containers.<p>I feel like you&#x27;re strawmanning me, here. I specifically avoided calling WLM &quot;containers.&quot; I said they&#x27;re building blocks that, combined with MAC-style service isolation (which also existed on 1980s mainframes), allow containerized isolation of consolidated services on a single OS image. It also wouldn&#x27;t be fair to directly call cgroups &quot;containers,&quot; though they provide similar building blocks for what I&#x27;m sure we agree are &quot;containers&quot; once configured by a tool like LXC.<p>I compared WLM to cgroups because both track utilization over a window of time and manage scheduling in a way that avoids starvation while enforcing other priority or fairness goals. The documented resource limitation and contention-sharing configurations for WLM [1] are undeniably similar to cgroups.<p>> I&#x27;ll give you a simple example. Do dd if=/dev/sda of=foo.img (or even /dev/null) in one container and measure I/O performance in the other.<p>Linux kernel cgroups have supported block I/O limits and weights for fair sharing under contention since 2008. I&#x27;ll give you the benefit of the doubt here, though, and assume you&#x27;re actually trying to provide an example of breaking the page cache because you mention that immediately afterward.<p>> The page cache is a global resource and so far there is not way to isolate it within containers. Buffered I/O is pretty fundamental to all workloads.<p>Shared page caching among containers is also one of the primary efficiency gains when multiple containers access the same on-disk assets. All along the spectrum, there are trade-offs between optimization via sharing (which risks decreased predictability) versus isolated resources (which necessitate efficiency losses through redundancy). I don&#x27;t suggest containers are special in this regard.<p>Regardless, this same issue exists for virtualization, especially once you get down to areas like the caches on RAID controllers or other buffering done on the host machine. Isolating resources and security always has overhead.<p>> cgroups aren&#x27;t free. See <a href=""https://www.berrange.com/posts/2013/05/13/a-new-configurable.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.berrange.com/posts/2013/05/13/a-new-configurable...</a>.<p>Of course they&#x27;re not free, but your suggestion that they&#x27;re heavier weight than hypervisors running kernels is both counter-intuitive and unexplained/undocumented in your post.<p>> I already cited a widely published benchmark (SpecVIRT).<p>There wasn&#x27;t anything you &quot;cited&quot; about the benchmark other than its existence because you didn&#x27;t provide any numbers resulting from benchmark to support your arguments.<p>So, your post is at the stage of hypothesis: you have a prediction and a way to falsify it. Please don&#x27;t pretend the results have already come out in your favor.<p>> You article cites made up numbers (5-10 minutes to provision a guest).<p>The numbers in the article are based on wall time for provisioning servers from public images on the Rackspace Cloud and EC2 using the API. Your qemu-img example is contrived because real-world systems don&#x27;t keep local images sitting around on the host machines to provision new instances, disallowing the twin advantages of local, high-bandwidth I/O and copy-on-write.<p>In contrast, container creation that shares existing host machine libraries and binaries is very fast, including in real-world deployments (like PaaS providers).<p>> Note that I&#x27;m not normally one to bad talk anything. Containers are fine for that sort of thing. But you&#x27;re claiming that containers obsolete virtualization and that&#x27;s just plain silly.<p>But you are strawmanning me, again. I never said &quot;containers obsolete virtualization.&quot; I said that containers will be &quot;the future of the cloud,&quot; meaning that they should come to dominate given how well they&#x27;re starting to fit most cloud users&#x27; needs. That doesn&#x27;t imply obsolescence any more than saying &quot;ATMs are the future of consumer banking&quot; implies that tellers are obsolete and have no role in any sort of transaction.<p>> I expect better from you :-)<p>Well, I&#x27;d hope so, given our time in college together. I <i>just</i> realized this, by the way. :-)<p>[1] <a href=""http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/aix/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.aix.baseadmn%2Fdoc%2Fbaseadmndita%2Fht_cnfgwlm.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/aix/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%...</a>",1371606757

I don&#x27;t understand the argument that the remuneration for that value should be anything other than a function of the value provided; anything less than a linear relation looks dangerously, to me, like communism. Not to mention that &quot;Once a work is made, why should anyone pay for it again beyond the cost of transcription?&quot; is a direct corollary to the &quot;you should get an A for effort!&quot; fallacy.<p>> It is non-transferrable. Disclosure is boolean: it was either voluntary, in which case it does not impose any obligations on those who would reason about it (and copy it, and...), or it was involuntary, in which case it is damage (as in the case of NSA spying). Money doesn&#x27;t enter into it.<p>Two things:\n1. Copyright has to be transferable else its economic value would be severely restricted.<p>2. Privacy may not be &quot;transferrable&quot; (the term does not really make sense for &quot;privacy&quot;), but it absolutely is <i>tradeable</i>, and it&#x27;s hardly as boolean as you make it out to be. As Google and Facebook show us so clearly, people will gladly trade their privacy in exchange for services that would otherwise have a monetary cost. So it definitely is tradeable. But is that really &quot;voluntary&quot;? Well, if anyone dug into Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Scroogled&quot; campaign, it was inspired by a survey where the surprising finding was that a large fraction of users <i>did not know</i> that their private information was being mined by Google, and a significant portion of them said <i>did not like</i> it. (I&#x27;d like to say the numbers were 45% and 70% respectively, but I can&#x27;t be sure.) Now: Is that voluntary? What if they didn&#x27;t know, but did not mind; is that voluntary? What if they knew and didn&#x27;t mind, but hadn&#x27;t considered the implications; would you call uninformed decisions like that voluntary?<p>3. And that&#x27;s also a clear example that privacy is, in fact, monetizable, so money certainly enters into it.<p>> Copyright is a government-granted monopoly, it is typically transferable, and it typically imposes obligations even when licensed.<p>Just like money is a government-granted monopoly on a unique serial number. It&#x27;s not licensed, but it does impose obligations on whoever owns a hard copy at the moment (no copies).<p>> It is about monetizing copies at the expense of free expression and thought, and that expense can be bought, sold, in any measure, at the discretion of the holder. It is intended to be a tool to meter out copies for as much remuneration as possible, not to keep them to one&#x27;s self forever with no intention of ever monetizing them.<p>Yes it is about monetizing copies; or to put it in Psuedo-economical terms, it is about ensuring economic compensation for the value provided by each copy to the consumer. &quot;As much remuneration as possible&quot; would ideally be econ-speak for &quot;what the market will bear&quot;, but this does not apply well to copyright because of the severe market distortion that widespread piracy introduces. What you have instead is some portion of honest (or technically unsavvy) consumers paying more to compensate for large number of pirates who derive value without paying for it.<p>But, no it is <i>not</i> at the expense of free expression and thought.<p>1. Free thought is not affected <i>at all</i>. Copyright does not stop you from thinking anything. It only stops you from profiting from copies of <i>other people&#x27;s expression</i>, which is in no way related to restricting what goes on in your head.<p>2. It only restricts your &quot;free expression&quot; to the extent that your &quot;free expression&quot; exactly matches somebody&#x27;s copyrighted expression, or aspects thereof. Unlike patents, it is almost impossible that two independently created works will match <i>exactly</i> in any significant aspect.<p>3. True, some derivative expression is unfairly caught in the copyright web, especially when there is no clear way to extricate the creative aspect from the original work. The one example that I personally lament are Anime Music Videos; there used to be a ton of awesome work with very original and meticulous synchronization of music to completely unrelated videos that suddenly had their audio stripped on Youtube. However, if you look at the bigger picture, almost all copyright infringements are simply copying original works to avoid paying for it, either with money or patience.<p>4. Even then, tons of derivative work gets through just fine, simply because it makes no economical sense to stamp it out. Literary fanfic is one example.<p>5. The petabytes of torrents exchanged daily (yes, petabytes in the <i>US alone</i>; look up the numbers) is hardly &quot;free expression and thought&quot;. Ponder how many movies/songs/games that is, even if you assume a ridiculously generous 50% of the torrent traffic to be legit. It&#x27;s just the &quot;expression&quot; of the &quot;thought&quot; that somebody else&#x27;s work should be had for &quot;free&quot;.<p>The image you seem to have of copyright restricting &quot;free expression and thought&quot; is based on a focus on a secondary effect of copyright laws that is actually a very small edge case in reality.",1371604288

I don&#x27;t think Snowden was a singularly disgruntled guy who happened to have clearance.<p>His former coworkers are going to be smart, American, and patriotic too. Some percentage of that class of people will have strong opinions about being complicit in borderline-Constitutional activities. Snowden was the first to come forward, but do you really think there isn&#x27;t a significant pool of sympathizers still at NSA considering making a similar move?<p>Requiring cooperation between two analysts does raise the bar somewhat. But I think NSA would be making a mistake to assume that this is an isolated problem, with a tactical solution. I hope that the next guy (or pair) to come forward is as circumspect as Snowden seems to have been. Thank goodness Bradley Manning didn&#x27;t work at NSA -- that scenario would have real consequences for the world, instead of the noisy internal (and important and necessary) squabbling we&#x27;ll be doing for the next several months.",1371603615

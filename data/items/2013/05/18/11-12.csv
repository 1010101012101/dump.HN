Plus the other editors were open source where as ST2 was shareware (I'm guessing that may have changed now given the number of people who currently use it?)<p>I'm open to having my opinion changed though - if one of the Sublime Text fans want to put their case forward :) (Or at least better relating to why it's become so popular)",1368878283
5728611,comment,5727953,5727953,4,0,nashequilibrium,,,"I see a lot of people talking about Tumblr's userbase rather than the quality and potential profitibility of this userbase. As someone who has worked in brand management at P&G, i do not see any major consumer brand who's personality fits with lol cats and porn, therefore which major brand are you going to find to put ads next to that crap. Secondly lets take a look at the demographics and LSM's, tumblr is mainly made up of teenagers, you need to look at your ad spend relative to the quality of the demographic.<p>Start a successful extreme sports website and you will find brands like redbull that's brand fits in with your message, start a music sight and you will find a brand like pepsi that fits in well. Tumblr is all over the place, i have no idea how do you control the message? This website was built to just be cool and over the last six yrs they never tried to tie their identity to the type of revenue model they were anticipating. The reason for this is because they did not think of monetization at all. If you started a magazine back in the day, you would choose your segment and also tie in the magazines identity with the type of ad revenue you want to generate like a house & home magazine, you have home depot etc. This is not a billion dollar company. I am rooting for Marissa but her social media profile is starting to look bigger than her bite.<p>I will also add that Tumblr did try their had at curated content a few months back but decided to scrap the idea. This shows that they understand the need for more quality consistent content but are unable to execute. Flipboard has totally taken them to school on this front by allowing people to create personal magazines and you find a better quality experience. They need to learn some stuff from Flipboard even though it is not 100% comparing apples to apples.",1368878271

5728601,comment,5726572,5726572,2,0,needle0,,,"I own an Epson Moverio, which the Meta 1 glasses appear to be based on. I have a small bit of firsthand experience with hacking on it to do ARish things.<p>* The Moverio consists of two parts, the glasses and the control box. The two connect via a seemingly proprietary connector. The control box runs Android 2.2, archaic by today's standards. USB host mode was introduced in Android 3.1, so there would be no straightforward way to feed the depth camera's information into the control box.<p>* Unity3D, which Meta's software stack claims to be using, does run on the control box once you output your Unity project to an Android application. For the app to run, I had to tweak the build settings to support both ARMv6 and ARMv7 (The app failed to start when built for ARMv7 only). This was doable in Unity 3.5.x. However, Unity 4 removes support for ARMv6.<p>So I'm full of question marks:<p>* Did the Meta team somehow obtain/reverse-engineer the specifications for the Moverio glasses' connector, plug it into a more powerful device, and ditch the control box?<p>* Did the Meta team replace the Moverio control box's OS with a more modern version?<p>* Is Meta 1 stuck with the older Unity 3.5.x?<p>* Or am I doing it wrong, and is it indeed possible to run Unity 4-built apps on the Moverio control box?<p>Also, other have mentioned but the field of view is disappointingly small with this device - just a small window in in the middle of your view.<p>Overall, confused.",1368877923

Since the code will be open sourced, it will definitely benefit thousands of companies.<p>In fact, there was one graduate student who was in our campus last semester was doing research in this area. He did a very good job on this. And, he won the first ACM machine learning prize for the paper. If you are interested in this area, you can actually go to the library and find out the paper. Now, I think he is now working in the Microsoft Research Team(the usual career path in our campus).<p>I actually did a tiny recommendation engine using one of the collaborative filtering algorithm - slope one predictor last two days.

For example I think they mentioned the entire Yahoo Toolbar and Yahoo Finance teams in the U.S. were being laid off. That isn't a reflection on the skills of those engineers so much as recognizing that these products aren't mission-critical.<p>Also, if you have to fire people, often it's easier to fire people who are more recent additions to the team, even if they are more skilled. It has less of a social impact on the rest of the company, and you lose less institutional knowledge.<p>In short, there are plenty of reasons to believe there are great engineers being let go.

And then they make money on interest.<p>My ideal online payment solution (and I think it'll happen later) is for everyone to have a number they put into a site to buy. Then they have to log into online banking and approve the charge. There'd be a description of the company and the charge automatically with the debit, and ""Approve / Decline / I Don't Know This User"" choices or some such.<p>It'd reduce fraud to near-zero levels, and I don't think it'd cost too much to set up. Credit cards will live on for a long time as short term credit, but I reckon banks could offer that at much more reasonable rates with a much better idea of people's finances and credit profiles. And with widespread enough adoption, merchants could start telling CC companies to take a hike. Heck, the bank could even make it a ""card that you control"" or something to not break from the card tradition.",1228963469

393852,comment,393180,393745,0,0,light3,,,"Aye, this also has truth. I always hold the opinion that my parents sacrificed too much, they set out and worked long hours in hope to provide a better future for themselves and me. However they did not revise their thinking, and even 10 years down the road when finance was no longer an issue they're still inexplicably drudging along, all in the name of sacrifice.<p>This illustrates that sacrifice prolonged has dangers, namely it dulls purpose, and gives you an excuse to choose a passive approach to life.<p>This type of sacrifice is different in the sense you're sacrificing for 'a better life' as opposed to sacrificing for 'your purpose' or the purpose of your family. And its very dangerous to sacrifice for 'a better life' per se, because we humans are never satisfied ;p",1228963098

Its not that apps are sorted by price.<p>It is that the customer is fundamentally <i>APPLE'S CUSTOMER</i> and not <i>YOUR CUSTOMER</i>.  No matter what the exact arrangement is, only those vendors who catch a lucky break from Apple are going to do well.<p>This is the same lesson everyone should have learned from the casual game industry: the portals make out like bandits.  A very few megahits make obscene amounts of money.  Every other content producer gets shafted, because they are systematically tying themselves into a hit-driven, rapid-obsolescence, no-value-added business model.<p>This serves the portals great: churn and burn apps get them lots of repeated transactions and incentivize their best customers to come back every day to see whats new.  This is <i>terrible</i> for developers because you get like a two-week period to make back your development expenses and then, boom, residual sales asymptotically approach zero.<p>(Its sort of like being in the music business, incidentally, except the residuals die off even faster.)<p>Compare the sales graph for <i>any</i> App Store app, I don't care what the quality is, to the sales graph for a software company with its own website.

You won't get the <i>gradual march upward</i>, instead, you are immediately thrown back into the meatgrinder to make another churn and burn app.<p>An additional salutary benefit of the own-your-own-app-and-your-own-customers: you're not dependent on Apple's good graces and business fortunes to continue to make a living on their platform, and when you come out with version 2.0 or RelatedApp 1.0 you can use your existing customers as both a source of marginal revenue and a source of springboard marketing.<p>(Hypothetically assuming that my next app was also pitched to elementary schoolteachers, where exactly would one go about getting a list of 1,200 elementary schoolteachers with a demonstrable interest in software which helps them out?

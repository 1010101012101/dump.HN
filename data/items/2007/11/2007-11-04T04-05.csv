when the content/media/art is the product it becomes increasingly more important than if your a casual blogger.  ",1194152259

It's relative.<p>In an absolute sense, research has very much reduced the amount of effort required to listen to world-class classical music in your home -- you used to have to practice until you could play like Mozart, but now you just buy an iPod and download high-quality recordings of the world's best musicians for a couple bucks. <p>Researchers can also help you effortlessly beat the world chess champion -- they invented Deep Blue. (Soon to be available in laptop size at your local Best Buy.)<p>We've even built decent simulations of the experience of playing a world-class rock guitar solo in front of thousands of fans (Guitar Hero II), coordinating an attack on a medieval fortress (World of Warcraft) and, yes, beating Tiger Woods at golf (""EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '07"").<p>But, of course, it's hard to be <i>proud</i> of these things. Our society still finds ways to respect the people who put in the hard work to actually <i>be</i> Tiger Woods, and who resist the temptation to just play golf on the Playstation like the rest of us.",1194150817

Yet playing catch-up isn't the way to beat your competition. These other sites need to find a way to use own unique strengths to differentiate themselves from Facebook (and each other).<p>Really, the biggest thing OpenSocial has going for it is Google's support and the integration between OpenSocial and the Google ""platform"". Third-party apps that take advantage of GMail would definitely be awesome. But that's because that plays to Google's unique strengths, rather playing catch-up to Facebook's. Doing the latter would be like Facebook trying to do e-mail and search.",1194150070

The only reason that comes to mind for any such variation would be the availability of charitable handouts or government welfare, and that's objective enough to easily factor out.",1194148974

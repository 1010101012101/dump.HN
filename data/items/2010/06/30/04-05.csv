Given that they're both dynamic programming languages with runtime dispatch, there's really little impedance mismatch between Ruby and Objective-C.  Thus MacRuby, a Ruby implementation that encapsulates Objective-C objects and messages in Ruby objects and methods.  Cocoa in Ruby without a bridge -- it's already there, it's a done deal.<p>Now as for whether they'd <i>replace</i> Objective-C with MacRuby, no, that wouldn't make sense.  The two would live side by side.  Apple can continue to implement Cocoa frameworks and core applications in Objective-C while also offering an excellent Ruby programming environment built on top of that.<p>It's sort of like C# vs. F# or IronPython in the .NET world -- Microsoft didn't have to replace the base .NET assembly implementation language (a.k.a. ""assembly language for CLR"") in order to provide more attractive dynamic or functional languages on top of the same infrastructure.<p>EDIT: In fact, the semantic mismatch between Objective-C and dynamic languages like Ruby is less than the mismatch between dynamic languages and the CLR, which mirrors the statically-typed semantics of C#.  Is Apple's combination of the Objective-C type and dispatch systems and LLVM going to one-up .NET from a direction that we didn't see coming?",1277871397

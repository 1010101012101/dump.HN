I started research out of interest in learning applications of my studies and mostly to get funded by a lab and avoid out of state tuition.<p>The norm in my program is to take 4 semesters, since its a general masters it places requirements on the breadth of your studies as well. Hence, I did study machine learning, and even did research in it in my first semester. However, I got funded completely by a different research lab working in a different area of AI, and since education is expensive I went with that.<p>Between research and completing the course requirements for other areas (h/w, systems, theory), I&#x27;ve had limited time to actually use or learn anything more in that field.<p>Also, it does serve as a delaying tactic since, as I pointed, I can&#x27;t stay on this visa without a job and while I&#x27;m on the lookout for jobs, I might end up taking one that I&#x27;m not totally into.<p>In your eyes, do you think a wiser strategy is to try and get a job right now and graduate this semester?",1423688322

Many games are complete failures because of the fact that they attempted to cram too much into the design.<p>Many of the best games take a core concept that&#x27;s fun and refine it, polish it until it&#x27;s gleaming. Only then do they add some small things off that core gameplay to flavor the experience. The shotgun approach of throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks is a great way to either release a buggy, unfun mess (if you&#x27;re lucky) or burn through your capital, goodwill, and development team before cancelling the project (if you&#x27;re unlucky).",1423687842

9035621,comment,9034427,9034427,0,0,krenoten,,,"I&#x27;d be pretty nervous about any attempt to recreate Finagle in Go.  Scala provides many ways of creating composable complexity.  Finagle leverages pretty much every feature of Scala (and there are many) to maximize this composability in a sane way, but because there is simply so much complexity in Finagle, a lot of opportunities for composability have been skipped due to lack of need within Twitter (maybe finagle-http has significantly improved in the last year, which is mostly what I&#x27;m thinking about when I say this) but it&#x27;s a LOT of complexity, sort of like the RoR of distributed systems, and when you want to diverge from Twitter&#x27;s chosen trade-offs, it may be a hellish experience.  It&#x27;s pretty sweet for when your problem space aligns with Twitter&#x27;s, however.<p>Go has basically none of the mechanisms for sanely creating composable complexity that Scala has.  It makes me really grossed out to think about something with the complexity that Finagle exposes as a Go library.  Go is all about small, sturdy tools that work for most of the cases most of the time and that compose well with each other - IF - they are built into the standard library.  And if it&#x27;s not, have fun spending your time writing uni-typed interfaces for any kind of interop with desired complexity.  Go is great for writing dead simple byte slingers, pipelines that will be rigid in the most dynamic possibility, guns that shoot JS and interact with services, etc.  That&#x27;s simply not Finagle.",1423687826

The question is whether those differences are sufficiently exploitable. This is how policy works. If you are saying that you can&#x27;t generalize over a population, you&#x27;re saying that there are roughly zero between-population differences that are exploitable for strategic policy. Random things are unstrategizable.<p>I think that the Chinese and Japanese value hard work more than Americans and Canadians, and I think so because Americans and Canadians have an unfortunately true belief that intelligence is highly predictive of performance, and also that intelligence is not meaningfully improvable. On the other hand, I think that Chinese and Japanese people have the belief that effort is a far better explanation to performance.<p>The problem is that performance must surely be at least a combination of effort and ability; a depressed person may have the bodily ability to pick up the phone for their friends, but they might not care anymore.<p>I thus say this: if you go looking for studies on cross-cultural pedagogy, I claim that you&#x27;re going to find that American and Canadian students are significantly more likely than Chinese and Japanese students to avoid harder challenges, to pursue easier challenges, to practice mastered over unmastered material, and to avoid a problem after poor marks.

By comparison, I ate much more and exercised much less and had very low body fat.

A couple sweets or sugary sodas each day and you can easily cross over.<p>While there are likely exceptions and extremes (thyroid issues), the vast majority have zero clue about how much they really eat.

For all the organizations that you can partner with to produce fruitful research, you have many who are trying to make a quick buck on the trendiness of security. We don&#x27;t have a lot of Mayhems. We have a lot of Acunetixes.<p>I agree that the methodologies and tools required to write secure code already exist. However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to place all the onus on software developers. Even if they avoid C/C++, they still have modern pitfalls in just about any language.<p>I think more research should be done on security software of course, which is why I wrote this blog post. What my post doesn&#x27;t address however is that I also believe more research should be done in educating developers. It doesn&#x27;t matter if all the tools to help them exist if few of them bother to look for them. Research could help in this regard - education.<p>Finally, I think you&#x27;re much more familiar with Mayhem than I am, but I call into question the bugs Mayhem found. How many were high severity and/or actually exploitable? (I&#x27;m actually asking because I&#x27;ve seen conflicting reports from both Mayhem and Michal Zalewski on the matter).<p>When I say being used in the open, I mean in a similar way to Project Zero&#x27;s activities. Mayhem was used once on Debian as far as I&#x27;m aware, and to my mind it looks more like publicity than an ongoing effort to find bugs.",1423687192

When you download an official image from Docker Hub&#x27;s servers, you are not charged in any way, and you are not required to create an account.

I&#x27;ll probably also get some facts wrong, but corrections are welcomed for that.)<p>I think a lot of it comes down to &quot;culture has consequences&quot;.  It may not be possible to say that one culture is &quot;better&quot; than another, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the collection of habits & worldviews that make up culture doesn&#x27;t have real effects in the real world.  And then when you apply the yardstick of economic success - which itself is a culturally relative value, many cultures don&#x27;t care about money at all - of course some cultures will do better against that metric.<p>Some examples:<p>Many cultures (Indian, Pakistani, everything descended from Spain/Portugal/Latin America) have a very loose notion of time.  When you say 6:00 PM, you really mean sometime between 6:00 and 7:30 PM.  This is great for social occasions, where everyone shows up relaxed.  It&#x27;s not so great for business deals or transactions, because it makes it very difficult to plan or schedule anything efficiently.  Imagine running an airline where every passenger might show up in a 2-hour window after the official departure time.<p>Some cultures (like the American South, Arabia, or Russia) tend to be very honor-based, where if someone slights you, you have to enact revenge or be seen as weak.  Other cultures (like Silicon Valley, Christianity, or some Confucian cultures like China and Japan) are much more &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; - when someone slights you, you refuse to associate with them and instead focus on building up yourself and your relationships so that your personal life improves, figuring that they&#x27;ll get their come-uppance eventually.  The former is more effective in sparsely-populated settlements where everybody knows everybody, because word travels around and a 3rd-parties assessment of you as weak could negatively impact future relationships.  The latter is more effective in densely-populated environments with a number of chance encounters, because each new opportunity comes with no memory of previous encounters, and so your time is better spent on activities that are positive-sum for yourself rather than negative-sum for your opponents.  The contemporary economic world is much more like the latter than the former.<p>Some cultures (notably the U.S.) believe that it is the responsibility of the person being offended to speak up and assert their boundaries.  Other cultures (notably Japan and China, and historically Native American societies) believe that is the responsibility of the actor to avoid causing offense.  Both of these are local maxima <i>within</i> a society of like people; in the U.S. everyone is jostling for position and constantly negotiating what&#x27;s okay and what&#x27;s not, while in Japan everyone knows the rules for what&#x27;s socially acceptable and doesn&#x27;t step outside those bounds.  However, when they contact each other, it&#x27;s pretty clear that the culture that believes it&#x27;s somebody else&#x27;s responsibility to speak up when their rights are violated will run roughshod over the culture that believe it&#x27;s somebody else&#x27;s responsibility not to violate rights.  Witness how the first American settlers reasoned &quot;Hey, if the indigenous people don&#x27;t have the concept of land rights, all this land must be free for the taking!&quot; while the indigenous people were more like &quot;You take our land, give us diseases, destroy our way of life, and herd us on to reservations, and all because we greeted you as friends.&quot;<p>(As a side note, I suspect the latter cultural disagreement is behind much of the distrust and criticism of Silicon Valley startups.  As a startup founder, you have to believe that what you&#x27;re doing is making the world a better place, and so you just <i>do things</i> and see how it comes out.  If people object, you take their objections into account and see if you can work out a compromise solution that respects their rights too, but you don&#x27;t specifically try to think of everyone that might possibly be negatively affected and avoid doing it if there&#x27;s even one such person.  However, many people - even in the U.S. - operate under the assumption that &quot;Other people should not do things that hurt me&quot;, and so they are somewhat justifiably upset when they lose their job due to technology or their private data is used by advertisers or their favorite product goes away.)<p>Anyway, bringing it back to China - I think that Chinese culture has a combination of elements that together are pretty well-adapted to the modern business environment.  It highly values learning for learning&#x27;s sake, which is very handy in today&#x27;s information-focused world.  It&#x27;s pragmatic and engages with the real world.  It generally focuses on positive-sum engagements and long-term relationships, placing a high premium on social harmony.  It incorporates a strong work ethic and belief in duty as a virtue.<p>American culture is <i>also</i> well adapted to the modern economic world, but in different ways.  American culture places a high premium on risk-taking and pragmatic innovation.  It is also a guilt-focused culture rather than a shame-focused culture; the latter is probably Chinese culture&#x27;s greatest business weakness, as it encourages people to hide mistakes rather than learning from them.<p>Both of them are significantly more well-adapted than other cultures that focus on personal honor, shame avoidance, male-dominance (one of the U.S&#x27;s key economic advantages over the last 60 years has been the entry of women into the labor force), or traditional values.  These are not bad cultural traits, but they are disadvantages in competing in a system that values rapid adaptation to the needs of others.",1423686824

I&#x27;m a brown guy who came to America sometime ago, my family relatives are right now basically all priming their kids to become doctors. They are so committed to the idea that their kids are going to become doctors that I would bet a good amount of money that the kids <i>will</i> get good MCAT stores, <i>will</i> get residency, and perhaps even open their own clinics (they know this is where the money is, and they let their kids know this too).<p>The path of lifee I think is more conservatively and clearly defined in India than in America or other Western societies. In America, if your son wants to be an artist, a painter, a musician, you tell him to try his best. Indeed it is socially acceptable both by families and our society for a person to aspire to be anyone he wants to be, to do anything he or she wants to do. In contrast, the strongly knitted social cohesion and solidarity of places like India and Bangladesh impose a certain structure and path: you go to school -- you try really hard, you respect the hell out of your teacher, you go to college, you get married, and you try your darndest to provide as much as you can for your wife and kid. And that is not done by playing with high-risk games -- it is done by going the way that is known and suggested by community leaders, friends, families.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve answered your question very satisfactorily or completely, the best I can say is it&#x27;s the culture that&#x27;s responsible for this. And I&#x27;m totally not happy right now with mainstream culture of America (especially the one lead by corp: misogyny is rampant (have you read the shit Eminem says in interviews?

This method was derived from various aspects of the English system and was not invented in America, though it was first widely adopted there.  Though there are well-known examples of industrial espionage, American innovation in manufacturing can be attributed a combination of vast natural resources, dynamic social structure, and widespread generalist education (as opposed to the apprenticeship system of Britain at the time) [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_system_of_manufacturing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_system_of_manufacturin...</a> (the article is sufficiently cited to support the claim)<p>[2] McPherson, James M.

Our reference implementation, itself made up of multiple pieces (wymd, wymsy, oneweb, ...) provides a way to actually make use of that spec and to validate all the guarantees of the strict interfaces.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not a fan of entities who would define a spec in isolation without a reference implementation alongside it - where&#x27;s the proof that you&#x27;re making the right decisions? We provide that implementation to keep ourselves grounded.<p>- Won&#x27;t multi-language limit features?<p>Not really.<p>For one thing, since we&#x27;re self-hosting we can&#x27;t afford to lack power and expressivity. For example everyone has the ability to refer to types (as per generics) else we wouldn&#x27;t be able to implement the core. ;)<p>Our interface language - it&#x27;s quite simple, to make the addition of new language bindings trivial, but we expose built-in services to use more powerful features simply by switching which nodes you&#x27;re holding on to - there&#x27;s a data-implementation divide, where a node needn&#x27;t understand a feature in order to deal in its data.<p>The net effect is that language bindings can be created trivially and evolved to support features as a good way of dealing with them is found (e.g. in the simplest case, Javascript Int64 support).<p>- Having a central authority is better.<p>This is an interesting one :D - I agree, in a way.

9035458,comment,9034673,9034885,0,0,desdiv,,,"OK, I&#x27;m fed up. China is really dangerous and way too aggressive. Obviously, its political system is on an imperialist ego-superpower course.<p>It&#x27;s spending on its military like crazy. The navy strives to reach a size and power never seen since the demobilisations after the Second World War. Its navy patrols aggressively in foreign waters, often provoking fights and shooting up foreign boats even though China didn&#x27;t declare war. It&#x27;s only a matter of time till the aggressive behaviour hits some wrong ships, boats - or maybe an airliner mistaken for a fighter.
Plenty invasions of sovereign countries in the last 35 years alone prove it&#x27;s unfit for lasting peace, an imperialist hyper-aggressive power. This aggressiveness is underpinned by intense propaganda and myth-building at home, with entire service industries inflaming the population against countries they cannot even point at on a map. Racism plays into this as well, with lots of derogatory names for foreigners of exotic looks.<p>China&#x27;s gunboat and cruise missile diplomacy with occasional and nowadays frequent bombing of neutral countries is out of control, but a United Nations Security Council veto power protects them against formal repercussions. They even bombed an American embassy 15 years ago and nothing happened!
I&#x27;m especially concerned about how they now discuss how to wage a future war against the United States. All the public discussions are solely about how to defeat American land-based defences so Chinese naval battlegroups can close with the American coasts and bomb military and strategic targets at will. Unmanned combat drones are an especially favoured tool for this; many Chinese appear to have high hopes for these. The range and stealthiness is apparently at the centre of their hopes.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t stand by this and pretend we aren&#x27;t involved.

This is where the discussion cycles back to the utility of 1:√2.<p>In most offices in the U.S. that I&#x27;ve been in (I say this in a fast and loose fashion), they carry three sizes (with the following typical uses):<p>(1) ANSI A (US Letter) for standard letters (uses full portrait page) and leaflets (uses one-third landscape page) or booklets (uses half landscape page).<p>(2) US Legal because there are plenty of legal documents are out there that use US Legal (uses full portrait page).  And perhaps as a bonus, but not as frequently seen, US Legal can be folded into small booklets (uses half landscape page). Although, I don&#x27;t see this happen as much as ANSI A being used for booklets.<p>(3) ANSI B (Ledger/Tabloid) because it can be great for spreadsheets and folded to US Letter sized pages. Either for collapsing the spreadsheet or for making booklets with US Letter sized pages (uses half landscape page).<p>Now, yes, I did not mention all uses.  I merely mentioned what I have frequently seen used based on my experience.  But one of the key take-away points for the &quot;common-use/general-purpose&quot; ANSI A and ANSI B paper sheets is the notion of folding the paper in half to form a booklet.<p>You don&#x27;t see many offices carrying ANSI C (17&quot;x22&quot;), which is the next step up from ANSI A maintaining the same proportion. (So availability of this is considered unlikely in this context.)<p>Of the three, perhaps US Legal can stand alone because it offers a significantly relevant special situation proportion.  So, we&#x27;ll set US Legal aside for now.<p>And so, you get usage of Half US Letter (1.5454…), Full US Letter (1.2941…), Half Tabloid (which is just US Letter, 1.2941…), Full Tabloid (1.5454…).  So, you&#x27;ll get an oscillation of two distinct proportions with paper that doesn&#x27;t use 1:√2, and in the case of ANSI A through ANSI E, you get the 1.5454… and 1.2941… oscillation.<p>Now, if you had ISO 216 sized paper, all of the proportions would be the same no matter what, and it becomes very easy to choose between paper and half-paper sizes because they all work alike with regard to their proportions.<p>However, with the oscillating ratios, you have to choose which one you&#x27;re targeting and be sure of it, because the next larger (or next smaller) size is significantly different.<p>Now, more in-between sizes could solve this, but that also means you&#x27;d probably end up carrying around yet another paper size because of it.  If you simplify things by getting rid of the dual-proportions and have a unified proportion instead, then the added frustration from the differing layout proportions go away instead of trying to address that with another paper size for something in-between.<p>So, to parallel the Half US Letter (feels like an oddball that is basically super small Tabloid, 1.5454…), Full US Letter (1.2941…), Half Tabloid (is just Letter, 1.2941…), Full Tabloid (1.5454…):<p>Half A4 (is just A5, 1.4142…), Full A4 (1.4142…), Half A3 (is just A4, 1.4142…), and Full A3 (1.4142…).<p>With the layout for Half US Letter, your next proportional step-up is Full Tabloid.  (Huge jump!)  Or from Tabloid, your next proportional step-down is Half US Letter (Really small!)  You could have an in-between size to satisfy it, but it seems excessive when you could have just had used the 1:√2 proportion to begin with and not worry about any of those additional considerations.<p>---------------------------------------------------------<p>Saying it another way...<p>Where, ½·x signifies folding a sheet for purpose as a booklet, and the paper that satisfies that requirement is mentioned inside the cell.<p>Dealing with only our &quot;letter&quot; size (1) and &quot;tabloid&quot; size (2) sheets that we have in our office, we get the following:<p><pre><code>    ANSI    | ½·1 | 1·1 | ½·2 | 1·2 |

The west has benefited tremendously from the deliberate, and sometimes accidental ability to create conflict around the world, and gain profits from it including in China. This isn&#x27;t some controversial claim, this is pure, and simple Nationalism, and enlightenment ideas of State.<p>However as the industrial dregs settle down, and as Imperial might whimpers, we&#x27;re seeing the rise of countries that were left destitute in the past 150-200 years, regaining a sense of internal stability. The result of this new founded stability around the world unfortunately, or fortunately, creates a new world where the center is other than the west. Already India, and China are talking about a polycentric world that activity eschews the hegemony of the west, in favor for a more equal world, because let&#x27;s face it the west is the 1%.<p>Even if we deny all that it would be very difficult to refute that America has in the past 100 years been an incredibly stable nation compared to the entire world, and coupled with an active participation in global economies. It was perhaps the only nation on the planet that was internally stable, and had a strong external presence. All other nations eventually declined, had internal struggles, or were just emerging as global economies. This alone gave America an unprecedented advantage over the last 100 years, and that advantage is slowly becoming meaningless as the entire globe is stabilizing.",1423685626

Public, verifiable work (e.g. bug bounties).<p>2. Solid references and past experience with clients who themselves understand what to look for in a security consultant. You obviously check these references. Alternatively, a solid reference that the candidate worked at NCC Group, Accuvant, Leviathan, etc.<p>3. Research in the field, such as discovering a new class of vulnerability, publishing vulnerabilities in ubiquitous software, etc.<p>Prioritize #2, because not all adept security folks like to conduct research or participate in publicly verifiable work.<p>Of the certifications you can have, the Offensive Security[1] certs are pretty rigorous. For example, the OSCP is a good indicator that a candidate knows what they&#x27;re doing to offensively test a client&#x27;s network. That&#x27;s about it. Almost all other certifications are run by people who have, at best, textbook knowledge of information security. People who get the CISSP can probably accurately describe a cross-site scripting attack to you in an interview, but there is no guarantee they can practically find it or defend against it.<p>The other issue is that while some certifications are good, a lot of folks in infosec just don&#x27;t care for them. They can find high paying jobs in prestigious companies without a degree <i>or</i> a certification of any kind, so they simply don&#x27;t bother, even though they could pass it. This means that you can&#x27;t reliably throw out candidates with no certifications...which circles back to my original recommendation. Work samples, references and public work are the best ways to judge a candidate&#x27;s talent. I&#x27;m directly aware that this system is used at Matasano and Accuvant, and it&#x27;s likely the norm at the other &quot;quality&quot; security consultancies.<p>&#x27;tptacek would have a lot of great advice to contribute on this matter as well.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-cert...</a>",1423685142

It&#x27;s common misconception that people claim China&#x27;s economy has overtaken US, it&#x27;s really a clickbait for media outlets last year.<p>Yes, using a calculation called &quot;purchasing power parity,&quot; it looks as if China has passed America. But that calculation is a statistically manufactured one, which supposedly makes up for different costs of living in the two countries. In short, it doesn&#x27;t measure anything that&#x27;s real, but a concept that some economists — and certainly not all — believe is important. It&#x27;s a phony comparison using a made-up number.
So what do the numbers show when you compare real apples to real apples? Real U.S. GDP this year will be about $16.27 trillion, adjusted for inflation, according to data from the U.S. government, World Bank and IMF. China? It will be less than half that, about $8.06 trillion. Not only has China not passed the U.S., but it&#x27;s quite possible it never will. China&#x27;s population growth is heading for a dramatic Japan-style collapse, which will slash economic growth dramatically in coming years. Growth has already slowed from 10% a year in the 1990s and 2000s to 7% — and it&#x27;s likely to fall further from there. That&#x27;s not all. The real measure of a nation&#x27;s standard of living, productivity and, ultimately, the size of its economy is GDP per capita. What does that tell us about the difference between the U.S. and China? This year, America will have per person output of $50,979 in real terms, China $5,947. So the average American is nine times more productive than the average Chinese. So don&#x27;t panic. The U.S. isn&#x27;t No. 2, except in certain IMF statisticians&#x27; minds. Nor will it be soon.

From China&#x27;s perspective, there is nothing wrong with &quot;stealing innovation,&quot; as this model has helped grow China&#x27;s economy and lift millions out of poverty over the past few decades. The diffusion of information does not produce the same &quot;value&quot; as the production of information itself, but from China&#x27;s perspective this diffusion certainly has its own value if it boosts the growth of native industry (which can one day hopefully enable China to produce more value from its own production of information).<p>From the American perspective, I think we tend to ascribe more value to hanging on to our innovation than is actually there. Hanging on to innovation will always provide a temporary advantage. The value of innovation is also dependent on the cost of preventing diffusion of the products of innovation. If the results of innovation are so valuable, companies should do more to prevent the outward flow of information, by locking up information systems and trying to hold on to as much of the involved human capital as possible. However, we do not do that as much as we should because there are other forms of &quot;value&quot; we can get by not locking up our innovation and human capital. In previous decades, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan have all followed practices similar to what China does today. The growth of native industries may have hurt America&#x27;s ability to compete in these markets (and even in America itself), yet companies like Sony, Samsung and others have brought value directly to American consumers and encourage more innovation now that they actively compete with American companies in the innovation game.",1423684924

Violent crime makes up 44% (actually, it&#x27;s probably quite a bit higher than that, because &quot;burglary&quot; is counted as a property crime).<p>To see why the federal statistics are misleading, consider how someone ends up in federal prison for burglary.",1423684853

This is my 4th semester here, and the normal timeline seems to be to take your masters in 3-4 semesters and get into the industry.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing research since my first semester. Since I was funded almost throughout I don&#x27;t have much of a debt.
I feel that my foundations in the areas of my interest (ml and systems) is shaky at best. I took grad level classes in both but realized that I didn&#x27;t have a firm grasp on a lot of things.<p>I could graduate this semester if I wanted to. As an international student, I don&#x27;t have the option of graduating and not taking a job. However,I don&#x27;t feel confident enough to pass an intense interviews in the places I want.
My other option is to graduate next semester. In my next semester my course load will be almost negligible giving me a lot of time to focus. Even if I don&#x27;t get funded the number of credits would be low enough that I can pay without debt.<p>I&#x27;m in the pool of interns for Google this summer (convert from a full time interview to the pool) and although it&#x27;s late in the process I might get matched to a project. If not, I might end up doing research or look elsewhere.<p>I&#x27;m facing quite some opposition. People said that it makes no sense to spend 5 more months in grad school if not for a PhD, instead to graduate now and look at shifting jobs further in your career. I&#x27;ve been told that delaying at my age (I&#x27;m 26 turning 27) would just harm my career further down the line.<p>The people on HN are experts so I thought I could get some insight. My main motivation for doing this was to get 5-6 months of intense deep diving into areas that I feel I lack - something I would not be able to do easily once I go full time ( I worked at Microsoft before this and I remember that initially I had barely any time to spend studying).<p>What would your advise be in this situation? Do you think it would be worth the time, and would this adversely affect my career options?",1423684815

It's kinda equivalent to #{} in Ruby strings.<p>As others have pointed out, v should probably be unquoted as well.",1251708987

Similarly they were perfectly capable of building things, yet they preferred that Sparta itself was a city of small buildings without walls. There's nothing left of it today.<p>Spartans, basically, eschewed possessions, apart from their personal weapons. They didn't want to grow soft and weak, so they made luxury impossible. An adult male Spartan owned some land, which was farmed by Perioikoi or Helots, and he was responsible for providing his share of food to the barracks in which he lived, but he could not ""profit"", ever.  Perioikoi (permanent residents of Sparta but not Spartiate themselves) could and did get rich. Even Helots (slaves from conquered enemies) usually lived materially richer lives than Spartans.<p>What they should have done was announced that glorious deaths didn't count until a Spartan had had so many kids, that would have made everyone happy.",1251707655

If so, the viral spread is assured as long as it is portable. Once the virus has spread, there will be pressure to improve it, possibly by increasing its functionality closer to 90%, but users have already been conditioned to accept worse than the right thing. Therefore, the worse-is-better software first will gain acceptance, second will condition its users to expect less, and third will be improved to a point that is almost the right thing.</i><p>the-right-thing:<p><i>First, the right thing needs to be designed. Then its implementation needs to be designed. Finally it is implemented. Because it is the right thing, it has nearly 100% of desired functionality, and implementation simplicity was never a concern so it takes a long time to implement. It is large and complex. It requires complex tools to use properly.

They then suggest that it might be most effective to actually contaminate the surface level of the site with low-levels of radioactive material so as to purposefully kill people that invade the site.  They then suggest doing calculations to see whether the expected casualties over 10,000 years would be worth it.  Icky but cold and calculated thinking about a cold topic.",1251706073

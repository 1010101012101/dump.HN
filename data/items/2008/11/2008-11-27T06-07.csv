378491,comment,377769,378471,0,0,shaunxcode,,,"I am a man trapped in a world of php. Like a prisoner making a go board from cock roaches and rocks. My other project is using the same transmogrification system to implement ruby esque syntax into php. One of my newer piece is let blocks which can return closures i.e.<p>$inc, $dec, $get = let($count = 0){[$count++],[$count--],[$count];}<p>This also uses the ability for multiple return values as well as square bracket lambdas which return their last statement if no explicit return is encountered.",1227768678

378487,comment,378418,378442,0,0,netcan,,,"Well I agree that it's not automatic. But to say that the quality of cars has nothing to do with sales... That's a bit much. Reputation can be built, repaired, earned or lost. Up is harder then down.<p>Japanese cars once had a bad name. So did Koreans. But their quality was (is) on an upward path. American cars once had a good name.<p>Anyway, the only bit I found interesting was this:
<i>""They love to blame labor agreements, pension plans, and health plans for their precarious financial situation, yet didn't the companies negotiate and sign those deals in good faith? Surely the down-the-road financial burdens were calculable at the time.""</i><p>It's as if the world brought this down on them. They negotiated these deals. Maybe unions had at the time some sort of monopoly. So what? They still bought in. These manufacturers certainly have heavy negotiation power over their suppliers. They can even squeeze governments (around the world, btw). They point to these because it's easy to point at & absolves them.<p>Now I am going to make an uninformed guess. The people in top positions at these companies are no longer the type of people that can make great cars, innovate, produce efficiently. If they are, it's a fluke. The no 1 job these guys have had for a while now is political manoeuvring. An ideal previous job is more likely to be head of some lobby group rather then managing a smaller manufacturer. That's just the way it is when the biggest influence on the company is its interaction it makes with governments: it gets good at it.",1227768322

I assume it's pretty much exactly what you're doing combined with hopefully having people around that already know some reliable methods (that were probably learned through trial-and-error), if such things exist.",1227768155

378482,comment,378424,378424,0,0,kaens,,,"I used the python tutorial and library reference in addition to ""Python in a Nutshell"" ( <a href=""http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596001889/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596001889/</a> )<p>With a healthy amount of coding, I've gotten very comfortable with python, although I still feel like I'm not quite utilizing it idiomatically. As such, I've been going through Programming Python ( <a href=""http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596009250/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596009250/</a> ) - which is very well written, IMO - as well as reading a healthy amount of other people's source code, notably CherryPy ( <a href=""http://cherrypy.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cherrypy.org/</a> ), since I use it a lot.<p>If you're experienced with other languages, I'd suggest implementing something like a tetris clone as an exercise in learning the language. If you're only experienced with web-dev (as is often the case these days), I'd recommend implementing a few small web-apps with CherryPy - it's the most ""pythonic"" ""web framework"" I've seen so far.<p>Oh, and keeping an eye on the mailing lists ( <a href=""http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo</a> ), particularly python-list, python-ideas, python-dev, and python-3000, can be very enlightening.",1227767773
378481,comment,378167,378271,0,0,njharman,,,"You fail for assuming future $1000 computer will be transistor based.<p>You're also being disingenuous in stating that every neuron contributes to a human's knowledge, that there is no overlap of knowledge between humans, and creating a computer with equivalent human knowledge requires a 1 to 1 mapping of neurons to thingers(say transistors, but could be quantum gate whatcha-ma-callits).",1227767668
378480,comment,378167,378367,0,0,cowmoo,,,"There are currently problems that is pushing the envelope of computational power, i.e., MD simulation (see D.E Shaw Research), engineering simulation on jet engines (see Pratt & Whitney) - even state of art of Infiniband clusters and custom-designed chips cannot simulate more than 10 seconds of molecular interactions or the complete fluid dynamics of a jet engine under a reasonable time-frame.<p>You are however right in the sense that AI can't be achieved by tossing more CPU power. Almost all of the media hype on the Deep Blue Chess Playing or hedge fund black boxes are all <i>narrow</i> AI, that is, programs that look ""smart"" because human beings have painstakingly poured so many techniques into a specific and narrow problem-space.

From a cultural perspective, Linux users simply don't buy software. No value judgment there, but simply a statement of fact. (I'm a Linux user myself.)<p>2. I don't yet have official packaging yet for Linux, but I plan to start with Ubuntu and Debian debs when I do. Right now it's just a tarball.<p>3. You're probably right that expensive software is going to be a harder sell when the source code is available for free.

378469,comment,377487,378137,0,0,kmavm,,,"I was around during the dot-com bust, and this little piece of revisionist lore always irks me. Something called ""Linux"" existed in 1998-1999, but it is not the ""Linux"" you know today, and when stacked up against Solaris running on Sun hardware, it didn't really work. People wanted to run their entire back-end on a single system, and that single system pretty much <i>had</i> to be a Sun E10000 running Oracle, because nothing else could scale up as high. The LAMP-stack scale-out style of system-building had not been invented yet.",1227765999

CPU speeds have barely improved since then, instead it's all about multi-core.<p>If passively parallel was all it took, we could have AI today, but we can't. And it doesn't look like CPU's are going to get any faster.<p>The curve did exactly what the linked article said: it turned into an S curve.<p>Moore's law still works because that's a measure of cost, but if you plot a single core, you get an S curve - which means no more singularity.<p>Plus, even if you had a super fast computer, you'd still not get a singularity since no one knows how to program AI - even if you gave them the fastest computer in the world.",1227765973

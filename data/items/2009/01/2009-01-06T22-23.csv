Legality and the sale price of $5 are the distinguishing features, not the fact that it was potentially available for free, as the article implies.  It would have been available for free regardless, just as all of the other albums on that list are.  From the consumer's perspective, downloading over a file-sharing network is the same whether it's legal or illegal.  Making it legal to share it that way does not induce significantly more people to do so (some, yes, but not many); it only means the people who would have anyway are not infringing.<p>So I think that factor is less significant than the sale price of $5, which <i>does</i> induce more people to buy it than a higher price would.",1231282121

It's almost certainly a log function.<p>And try this:<p>If just one person goes from start to end it will take him 4.8 seconds (.08 minutes).<p>So just line everyone up, and let them go one at a time. The last person in line will have to wait 80 minutes, but the average travel time is 40.04 minutes!<p>So adding a road does make it faster - much faster, contrary to what the paradox says. All you need is someone to police them and make them go one at a time.<p>And you are even waiting till they finish the trip before sending the next person. Send two at a time (one for each leg, since they are independent after all), and it's twice as fast.<p>I say putting in the road was a great idea! You cut the average travel time from 70 minutes to 20.02004 minutes. And the max from 70 to 40.08.<p>If I'm right, this does bust the paradox, but even more than that it shows that T/constant is the totally wrong formula for calculating congestion.

Very, very few people would. Most would downscale their lifestyles and adapt, as a lot of wealthy people are doing right now.<p>On the other hand, if you're going to be severely in debt and face major embarrassment, and have no hope of ever regaining your honor and getting out of the muck, and everything you might earn in the future will be garnished to pay off creditors whom you'll never be able to pay off, you can see that it might be tempting to snuff it.

422599,comment,421858,421858,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Gordon Bell, architect of the DEC VAX wrote ""High Tech Ventures"" and included this section on NNP's<p><pre><code>   Negative Productivity is a principle that I claim is worthy of a Nobel Prize. 
   Normal principles of productivity assume that workers create positive output. 
   Brooks refined the concept of software productivity to express it in terms of 
   the ""mythical man month,"" and in software engineering, it is understood that 
   different programmers vary in their productivity by several orders of magnitude. 
   According to the principal of negative productivity, it is possible for an individual
   to produce bad results that others must then redo; hence, someone who is 
   very negatively productive can keep a whole team busy with damage control, 
   preventing the team from producing any output whatsoever.
</code></pre>
For me this reduces to a set of four challenge for a software startup:<p>1. Screen out folks with negative productivity in the interview process.<p>2. Avoid screening out potential employees who have great strengths in addition to some obvious weaknesses.<p>3. Attract, hire, and retain enough strong players from the start to complete your first product in a timely fashion.<p>4. Fire anyone who made an initially strong impression but who is actually negatively impacting the performance
of the team (more broadly: identify and eliminate sources of negative productivity).<p>This last category, the ""plus minus"" people, are only truly dangerous if you donâ€™t have the ability to detect them and acknowledge that you have made a mistake.",1231279898

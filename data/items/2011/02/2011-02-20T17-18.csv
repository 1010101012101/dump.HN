I appreciate some of them, but I can't help but feel most of them are the same regurgitated crap that just happens to get a lot of votes. Presumably these (votes and submissions) are from people who agree with the article, not necessarily because they think it's a valuable new contribution. The best I can think of is to tag them as such and weight them differently. How? I don't know. We don't really have enough information about who votes for what to make guesses like that. (And I'm fully aware that weighting some votes higher than others could easily be seen as elitism)",1298224793

Sigils does indeed make the types of variables clear, tho I find that context alone is enough. Objects in natural languages don't have to have types in their spellings to convey their categories after all. The use of genders in some languages is superfluous, Chinese doesn't require that.<p>All I'm saying is, Perl requires too much more mental power to process than Python because of it's large vocabulary and inconsistent grammar rules.

You don't have to take time out for planned exercise or pay big bucks for a personal trainer to be active.<p>For example:<p>- Automatically take the stairs instead of the elevator when going up, even to climb 5 floors. Or perhaps, if you have to go 20 floors up, climb 5 floors by stairs, and then take the elevator. Use the elevator only for going down, to save your knees (gotta protect those knees).<p>- Walk to the store when possible. If you have to visit two stores that are a ten minute walk apart, leave the car at the first store, walk to the second one, and walk back.<p>- Take detours, on foot, on purpose. Take walks around nice neighborhoods if you happen to find yourself in one (perhaps visiting a relative?) and have fifteen minutes to spare.<p>- Buy only the big items in bulk and go shopping for fresh produce every two days on the way home from work with a carry bag. Carry your groceries on your arm inside the store instead of pushing them around in a cart. Fresh fruit and vegetables are expensive, but if that's all you buy on a daily basis (buying everything else the cheap way), it's affordable for most people in most places.<p>- If you don't have the time or skills to cook fresh food, get smaller, cheaper ready-made meals and offset them with large fresh fruit desserts (anyone can peel an orange), and regular fruit and vegetable snacks. Anyone can find healthy foods they like eating, and most people can find ones that fit in their budget.<p>- Involve friends and relatives. Find active things to do instead of just meeting up at bars or homes. I heard earlier today of two friends, a stand-up comedian and a lawyer, who take lakeside jogs on sunday afternoon to discuss politics with each other.<p>Anyway, maybe none of those things apply to your personal situation, and I respect that. But I do think that opportunity finds the opportunistic. I'm sure that everyone, literally everyone, can find ways to be more active and healthier than they already are. Even if it's something small and ridiculous (like carrying groceries instead of pushing them), it's still better than nothing.",1298221958

Someone comes along and answers the question with something that seems right (e.g. ""Here are a bunch of links on building REST services..."")<p>3.

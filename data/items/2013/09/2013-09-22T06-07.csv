6426052,comment,6424834,6425936,2,0,rwg,,,"The Visual Workstation line failed because you could get 90% of the performance for <50% of the cost by buying/building a dual-PII/PIII workstation and throwing an NVIDIA graphics card in it.  The architecture SGI used for the initial pair of Visual Workstations was proprietary and didn&#x27;t provide enough performance gain to justify its proprietary-ness, and the later models were just bog-standard PCs with bog-standard NVIDIA graphics cards slapped in pretty SGI cases with huge price tags.  The Visual Workstation line would&#x27;ve failed no matter what operating system they ran.<p>But the Visual Workstation line&#x27;s failure was merely one gut punch in a succession of gut punches that destroyed SGI.  SGI had two core competencies: graphics workstations and HPC.  The availability of cheap (comparatively) multi-processor x86 workstations running ports of formerly IRIX-only software killed their workstation lines, and the combination of Itanium being late, Itanium trailing <i>way</i> behind x86 in $/FLOPS and watts/FLOP, and x86 clusters with fast Myrinet (later 10GigE and Infiniband) interconnects becoming in vogue killed most (not all, but enough) of SGI&#x27;s HPC market share.<p>(I type this all with a bit of sadness: part of my first job out of college was running and porting software to a 20 CPU, 20 GB RAM SGI Power Challenge 10000, and I still have a soft spot for exotic big iron.)",1379833052

The most &quot;sudden&quot; have happened over centuries. The actual, demonstrated suddenness of current warming trends is a major part of the problem.<p>There are a bunch of problems in your post (I have no idea where you get the idea that we&#x27;re in a glacial period, these are just labels, but no one calls the Holocene anything but an interglacial; it is well established that Milankovitch cycles do not explain current trends; current atmospheric carbon will be there for centuries to come and will not stop warming us even if we were to stop all emissions today; you neglect ocean acidification, sea level rise, etc), but the fact remains that its ridiculous to assert that &quot;we should have our eyes&quot; on one threat instead of another, when we could have much more scientists and funding for asteroid detection if someone would exert some political will. <i>That</i> is what&#x27;s necessary, not trying to minimize other threats with specious (at best) arguments.",1379830765

2795647,comment,2795411,2795411,2,0,antics,,,"Ok, Gruber's answer is probable, maybe even correct. But what exactly is Jobs responding to[1] here? Not the ramblings of a tabloid magazine, but the reporting of a world-class newspaper. And before we band together behind a blogger it's worth at least considering exactly why (or if) his position is better.<p>Where the WSJ seems to have black-box-trusted someone else's expertise, Gruber seems to depend only on facts that he has a good command of. In other words, yes, it's easy to side with Gruber here (I know I do), but the problem is that even if he has actually named the correct successor, in at least one crucial aspect of the debate, he is still wrong: it is a disservice to the transformation Apple will have to undergo to simply <i>name</i> the CEO. Who's next is an important fact, but it is not the most important fact.<p>One thing to notice here is that Apple is a huge and complicated machine, and from the perspective of the CEO who knows all of this, it must seem absolutely precious that people like Gruber, and organizations like the WSJ believe they have a firm grasp on what's going on internally. In a lot of ways, this seems to have inspired the ""Hogwash"" comment, and on a darker note, it suggests something about the discussion as a whole: that the important bits, the descriptive and interesting bits, the more useful bits, lie in a discussion about what Apple should decide to be post-Jobs. What goals are realistic? What can and can't it be?<p>The work here is paving the way for who's next, and ensuring that there are clear objectives. <i>THIS</i> is the discussion worth having; points about who the next CEO are subsidiary, and only useful insofar as they give us information about these important questions.<p>[1] Particularly with his ""Hogwash"" comment.",1311378995

So you have to create a brand page via your own, personal account. Or maybe it can have its own account but that account can't be used as a usual Facebook account. Anyways. You got to select a proper category for your brand/company and this is confusing because there are many categories that overlap and it's not clear what kind of effect this has on your brand page.

Selecting and grooming smart people for crucial leadership roles. Requiring accountability and virtuous integration between product components and even different products.<p>- Tim Cook, optimizing industrial and business processes, ensuring high margins, protecting profits and structuring clever, unmatched deals for manufacturing and supply sourcing<p>- Jonathan Ive, designing the physical incarnations of Apple that create strong connections to the brand for customers<p>So is your position that software engineering has had an equally critical role to what's described above, and the engineering leadership has been Woz-esque?

My belief is that the problems for which Java-the-language is the solution are problems I don't want to work on, and that I don't have enough time in my life to address the problems I do want to work on, so I should simply develop a Java allergy that kicks in whenever I see the generics syntax and that causes my eyes to water until I flee towards fresh air. It works well.</i><p>This idea of developing an ""allergy"" / ""hate"" for Java reminded me of <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2011/04/21/135508305/the-sad-beautiful-fact-that-were-all-going-to-miss-almost-everything"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2011/04/21/135508305/the-...</a> ( HN discussion at <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2464764"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2464764</a> ). More specifically the part about ""culling"":<p><i>Culling is the choosing you do for yourself. It's the sorting of what's worth your time and what's not worth your time. It's saying, ""I deem Keeping Up With The Kardashians a poor use of my time, and therefore, I choose not to watch it."" It's saying, ""I read the last Jonathan Franzen book and fell asleep six times, so I'm not going to read this one.""<p>[...]<p>What I've observed in recent years is that many people, in cultural conversations, are far more interested in culling than in surrender. And they want to cull as aggressively as they can. After all, you can eliminate a lot of discernment you'd otherwise have to apply to your choices of books if you say, ""All genre fiction is trash."" [...]<p>The same goes for throwing out foreign films, documentaries, classical music, fantasy novels, soap operas, humor, or westerns. I see people culling by category, broadly and aggressively: television is not important, popular fiction is not important, blockbuster movies are not important.</i><p>--------------------------------------------<p>I also have this avoidance mechanism. I don't have enough time to learn about each programming language / framework / paradigm, so I kind of hate / ignore some of these, without really knowing them (PHP, .NET, Windows, ""enterprisey Java solutions""...). Not sure if it's the right thing to do, but I still have plenty to learn with the languages / frameworks I <i>am</i> interested in...",1311375989

But where is your concern for the legal staff and execs who conspired to trump up charge of hacking and lie to obtain an unjust extradition - nearly ruing someone's life and as pointed out above, only one ""misunderstanding"" away from ending in a police shooting.<p>This is true, even if unpalatable. It's mob justice, and it's because there aren't mob courts. If there aren't people's courts, or courts providing justice for the people, this will become the people's justice. The phrase ""What does work"" should suggest to you that it is becoming the common perception, if not fact, that the system does not ""work"".<p>The way to fix this is to, VERY severely, punish all those involved in corrupting the proper functioning of the law. You know how severely you'd be punished if you tried to bribe your way out of a drunk hit-and-run slaying of a cop? Certainly it'd occupy at least the next decade or so of your life. Like that, but more, and to the corporation itself as well.<p>Otherwise the victims, seeing only ruin via the system, will seek their own solutions.

2795494,comment,2793217,2795173,3,0,trussi,,,"I'm in this business to make money.<p>Anything consumer-based requires a huge user base because you can only charge a small amount per user.  Huge user bases take time (read: a lot of money) to build.  And users are very finicky and not very loyal.  They get bored easy and move on to the next hot thing.<p>This idea of building the huge user base first, then trying to figure out how to monetize it later is way too risky for me.  One false move trying to monetize it and your entire user base just disappears.  No thanks.<p>To summarize, my opinion is that, based on my limited experience and common sense, B2C products are way more risky than B2B.<p>I think B2B is much less risky with a lot more opportunity to actually make some money.  It's (relatively speaking) very easy to monetize a B2B product.  And there are so many niches that it's very easy to find a product that adds value.<p>My comment of not quitting your day job if you're going after B2C assumes you are trying to bootstrap your startup.  You simply don't have the money to bootstrap it.  If you are going after VC money, then you'd have to get the VC money before quitting the day job.  However, you won't be able to get the VC money til you can prove your product can gain hundreds of millions of users.  It's a catch-22.<p>My advice for anybody looking at doing a startup is to stick to the boring B2B market.  Don't get swept away with a grandiose idea of building a hundred million user product.  Even the most pedigreed players in this space can't figure out how to manufacture huge users bases (i.e. Color).",1311375683

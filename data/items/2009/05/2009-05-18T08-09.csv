Period.<p>There are a great many examples of differences in minimum wage (even within the U.S., the minimum wage has gone up and down) and I assure you, an Armageddon of unemployment does not ensue when the minimum wage is raised.<p>Your ""good people don't act on their convictions"" argument is plain silly, anamax.  Listen, there are rules for everything.  If we don't ""coerce"" businesses not to put toxins in kids toys and lead in drinking water, they will.  If we don't say, ""you can't economically rape your employees,"" they will.  Look at what happened in the late 19th century: company town, company stores, child labor.

It seems to me that the amount of projects hasn't dropped much, but many companies who might have hired someone permanently to implement them previously are now taking on external contractors instead.

There's still value to be had (like cross-vendor support) but that could wane as people realize many of the features they want are implemented in EC2 ""out of the box"".<p>Amazon is building an entirely new ecosystem and we'll start seeing news kinds of tools (commercial and open source) built in and around it.",1242635653

I’m talking about about 16 solid hours of work, at a minimum.</i><p>Here we have the marketer's version of the YouDidNotSpendEnoughTimeLookingAtTheIDEException, where people think an arbitrary number of hours has mystical significance because, why, if you could actually run a business in your spare time then the world would collapse on itself.<p>There is nothing intrinsic to marketing that says it all has to be done this week, in big consecutive chunks, for it to matter.  Some of the most important forms of marketing for Internet businesses take what I like to call calendar time as opposed to wall clock time.  For young sites, SEO is very intensive on calendar time but pretty light on wall clock time -- you throw a couple links at it, and then you go off and do other things to amuse yourself while waiting for Google to not hate your bones.<p>Similarly, blogging and similar reputation-building exercises reward stamina, not number of hours worked consecutively.  (Consecutive crunching helps you play Keep Up With Techcrunch.  Don't play Keep Up With Techcrunch.  That is a full-time job for several people, and besides, people who read Techcrunch are by and large terrible customers who don't actually pay for the stuff they read about.  Instead, write software/applications for the people who do actually pay for the stuff they read about.)<p><i>It’s very likely that the only way you’ll be able to get the word out to the masses about your new idea is by spending cold-hard-advertising-dollars.</i><p>Catastrophically wrong.  Understanding PPC advertising is a useful skill, don't get me wrong, but it works a lot better after you have customer validation from your other marketing methods.",1242635650

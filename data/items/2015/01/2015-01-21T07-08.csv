The degree of communication you can have with a dog is sometimes incredible.  Yes, they tell you what they want and figure out ways to communicate what they need.  Very soon you develop a mutual &quot;language&quot; of sorts.  We use hand signals for everything (as well as spoken commands).  So I can be at a really noisy outdoor setting and tell them what to do without uttering a word.<p>They also learn which member of the family is best for each need.  For example, they learned that cuddling-up with my young daughter is always a sure bet, they rarely ask my oldest son for that level of attention.<p>There&#x27;s also the empathy.  I&#x27;ve seen some amazing things, like a female GSD jumping up on the bed to cuddle-up with my wife when she got a phone call with bad news.  It&#x27;s freaky.<p>They know they are not allowed in my office and stop and sit or lay down at the door.  But they can also read when I am receptive to them coming in for a quick hug.

Because so much of grandstanding about torture is apparently from a deontological perspective (cf. your insistence on things being &quot;intrinsically evil&quot;), this was simply to clarify that the &quot;downsides&quot; were with respect to a moral calculus, not e.g. some CBA of material costs.<p>Second, certainly you can compose concepts together, even when that combination of the words is not formally enumerated in some lexicon?<p>Third, it feels much like you&#x27;re calling me ignorant by unnecessarily drawing attention to specific phrases and complaining about them not being in the official lingo. Now that you know what I&#x27;m referring to, could you either a) give the standard term for it which you would not have complained about, or b) apologize for the insinuation, or c) explain why you were unable to infer meaning of a new term the normal way?<p>>but I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ve been downvoted for underplaying the importance of a decision to support something many of us believe to be intrinsically evil.<p>That would be a bad reason, since I never &quot;underplayed&quot; the importance of this, which would suggest some sort of &quot;well, yeah that&#x27;s bad, but no big deal&quot;.  I&#x27;m complaining that, if you are going to write someone off every time their decision has a downside, they can&#x27;t win, no matter how good they are, and so the existence of such downsides isn&#x27;t a strike against their goodness at all, any more than a politician is evil for recognizing the existence of tradeoffs between funding for hospitals and funding for schools.

I wonder why you&#x27;ve gone all hypothetical here.<p>That was simply to avoid the (slimy) trick of refusing to engage moral dilemmas -- i.e. consider someone praiseworthy simply because they never had to encounter a hard choice. Is that a reasonable caveat?<p>>There are, hypothetically, moral dilemmas such that every outcome is equally bad.<p>>The decision to support torture is not one of them. I do not believe even a supporter of torture would characterize the decision to engage in torture or not to engage in torture as a decision such that deciding one way or the other will result in equally bad outcomes.<p>Why the focus on the case of the outcomes being equally bad? A &quot;supporter of torture&quot; can (and usually do) agree that torturing people is bad, but not as bad as letting millions die when the bomb goes off. (This is where people usually muddle the distinction between &quot;it wouldn&#x27;t work&quot; and &quot;it would be bad even if it did work&quot;.) They simply don&#x27;t regard the badness of that option as a dealbreaker.  (There&#x27;s no requirement that the options be equally bad for the logic to apply.)<p>That&#x27;s the same thing I&#x27;m criticizing on your part. You could equally well play the game of &quot;he advocated letting millions of people die!  Bad!&quot;  Well, sometimes you can&#x27;t win.

While it is true that mental illness does come out in times of stress and a stressful environment doesn&#x27;t help out, stress doesn&#x27;t cause it except in select illnesses. (and even then, stress doesn&#x27;t actually cause it).<p>I do agree with preventative measures, and there are some that can be taken, but this includes things like regular psychological screenings and physicals since some mental illnesses have biological markers: teaching people warning signs: teaching coping skills early on and making sure medication and real help are available to those that need it. A society with some empathy helps as well. But those are a long long way off and I&#x27;m not sure of the effectiveness of such things as a preventative measure: these might simply be a tool to catch mental illness early. Still positive but hardly preventative.<p>And the stress bit is a little misleading. My exhusband had schizophrenia and was on disability for it. Some days, it was ok. I worked, he did stuff around the house and took care of the dogs. Some days, the stress of having to shower was too much. It was impossible to eliminate the stress enough since so much of it was misreactions to very low stress levels.

I&#x27;d also recommend dance classes, particularly partner dances like salsa and tango.<p>Learning to talk to women helped me. I&#x27;m still not perfect but I used to have intense social anxiety in my late teens and early twenties. At age 26, a lot of people would describe me as confident and outgoing (it does take a lot of energy).<p>Exposure does two great things:<p>- Teaches you that rejection does not kill you. If ask a girl out or ask someone to invest in your company the right way, even if they say no they&#x27;ll respect you more. If you ask the wrong way and it goes horribly, life goes on and you&#x27;ll feel more self-respect for having tried. :)<p>- Gives you positive reference experiences. It takes time to get them, but they are truly the fruit of laboring at improving an anxiety. I still get nervous before first dates and I&#x27;ve gone on a lot of them. Recalling all the good ones I&#x27;ve had doesn&#x27;t make the nerves go away, but it makes them wayy less intense. Same deal with ambitious engineering projects. I&#x27;m still nervous before them, but I&#x27;ve succeeded in spite of nerves before so I can definitely do it again.<p>Putting exposure into a wider context, there are a lot of therapeutic approaches to treating anxiety—all the successful ones have substantial exposure components. I went through CBT for anxiety but the cognitive component is mostly there to help you productively process experiences when doing the behavioral component, exposure. Another interesting modality is systematic desensitization [1]. I&#x27;m a huge nerd so I got a kick out of making exercises for myself (eg. go tell 5 girls that they look really cute today) that took me through a systematic desensitization process.<p>A random sidenote, once I got past my own insecurities I was able to pay more attention to whoever I was talking to. You start to notice their insecurities! Everyone&#x27;s got em! Very attractive girls will be self conscious about their braces. Speaking specifically to professional networking, everyone is trying to impress each other but you don&#x27;t have to let it affect you. I talked to a cousin of mine this christmas that has had extreme success. He sold a business for more than $40M in his twenties. I just chewed the fat with him and listened and he was trying to impress me, a definite tell for insecurity! My business doesn&#x27;t make anywhere near that much. I can feed myself lol.<p>Getting out of your own head and over your insecurities is difficult but totally worth it. Keep at it!<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_desensitization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_desensitization</a>",1421825020

will have the image loaded when the next line of code is reached.  Events and callbacks are not principles you want to deal with as a first step.  Similarly, you have problems when they try<p><pre><code>    while(true){drawCircle(rand(),rand(),rand())};   
</code></pre>
The reasons why they can&#x27;t do things the way they assume are at a more advanced level.",1421824229

Probably not going to happen. And even with 1/10 of Earth as its user base, it was making <$1B/year.<p>I&#x27;d argue that the upside of making launches happen at 1/10 the traditional cost, with the potential for easy reusability with minimal refurbishment (which will allow much more than 2x launch volume, and a much greater cost reduction) is larger than WhatsApp&#x27;s to a hilarious degree.",1421824182

This isn&#x27;t a whiteboard problem, it&#x27;s done on a machine.<p>It&#x27;s never happened to me yet with this type of problem, but i&#x27;d be really impressed if I did run into someone who has the optimal algorithm for this memorized and can code it on demand in an interview. I&#x27;d certainly want to check that they haven&#x27;t spent all of their time just memorizing algorithms and they can still do other things of course.<p>If this did happen i&#x27;d want to validate that they really understand the solution and aren&#x27;t just spamming it out by rote, but if they&#x27;ve really got a few algorithms in the bank like this i&#x27;ll just consider this box checked and move onto other considerations.<p>all I really want to know is if the candidate has the &quot;horsepower&quot; to deal with these sorts of problems, many people don&#x27;t. someone who can code optimal solutions to these things on demand obviously does.<p>That said, obviously this is much easier for someone who&#x27;s dealt with trees and graphs and such a lot before, so it&#x27;s not ideal.

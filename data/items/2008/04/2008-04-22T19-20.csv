Some seem to be very successful, some I would classify more as hobby sites.<p>A few of my current ideas are:<p><pre><code>  * Vacation days (a very standard feature... they extend the time limit on your games so you don't while you're away on vacation) (carrot)
  * Advertising free (I don't have advertising now, so I'd have to introduce it for the free accounts) (carrot or stick?)
  * 30-day free membership (stick -- don't like this idea)
  * Limit on the number of simultaneous games a user can have (stick -- don't *really* like this idea, either)
  * Prize tournaments for members only (need to research this idea... not sure I like it) (carrot)

That means its going to take that much more of your time to work, to make money, and to live. If you're spending your time working to live, that means you're not using that time to work on your projects.<p>Right now I'm taking a culture hit. Living in Worcester, MA certainly doesn't put me at the center of startup culture, but Boston and Providence are close enough. I can take the bus/train and find myself surrounded by technically oriented people. A low cost of living in this town is what allows me to work less and affords me the free time to work on my projects.

170845,comment,170772,170772,0,0,ambition,,,"When someone invests in something there is an implicit assumption on both sides:<p>As a buyer/investor, I assume that your present value is greater than your price. This is what happens when people buy undervalued stocks. In better cases, I assume that your value after investment is greater than your present value by more than the amount of the investment. That is, by investing in you, I add more value than the amount of the investment. This is what Y Combinator does.<p>As a seller, you make the inverse assumption. Either you have lost faith in the value of what you sell, or you believe that with the investment, you'll be able to make more than you would otherwise.<p>In the case of life equity, the first case is tough to see. If you believed in your life equity's enough to sell it, you wouldn't sell it. So, you must be seeking the second case: If only I had more money now, I could make more money later, greater than the percentage of the funds I need to give back to my investor. From this we can assume that a potential investor would want a justification of how you will earn that money. We're effectively reduced to the same venture funding and loan structures that already exist today.<p>The only other way life equity would work would be as a scam: If life equity investors took advantage of bad-at-math or desperate sellers. This is actually the same as third-world loan sharks, only we're calling it an investment instead of a loan.",1208891460

170838,story,,,11,19,Locke,"Ask YC: The Carrot or the Stick?",,"I'm getting close to a major update to my website.  Right now I think it's
okay or maybe good, but after the update I think it will be a great site.  The
kind that I hope people will pay for.  I'm planning on introducing a paid
membership, and as such, I need to figure out how to get my users to switch
from free acounts to paid accounts.<p>I've been classifying my ideas as ""carrots"" or ""sticks"".  By my definition, an
effective stick should force a large percentage of users to pay or leave.
For example, a 30-day free account.  That's a very effective stick, at the end
of 30 days every user will either pay or leave.<p>By contrast, an effective carrot will induce a smaller percentage of users to
pay while <i>not</i> forcing any (or few) to leave.  For example, I may be very
happy with my free account, but when I see that I can have access to really
cool bonus feature X if I sign-up for a paid membership, I just can't resist.<p>The trick is that the carrot can't be core to the application.  If a free
account is crippled because really important feature Y is only available to
paying members, you're looking at a pay or leave situation and, thus, a stick.<p>If your users don't interact with each other -- that is, there's no network 
effect -- I think a strong stick is obviously best.  There's no benefit to
keeping users around in free accounts.  Best for them to convert to a paid 
account or leave.  But, if there is a network effect, then, I think, it 
becomes much more complicated.  Should only carrots be used?  Or, perhaps a
gentle stick?<p>I'd love to hear examples of effective carrots or sticks.  What works?  What 
doesn't?  Is it better to be nice and use only carrots?  Or, is it better to 
force the issue with a stick?",1208890916

My business is <a href=""http://linebuzz.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linebuzz.com/</a> We wrote the first line of code on April 1 and launched on May 10. We were covered as dot-com of the day on 100shiki.com in Japan and within days we had users in 15 languages on the site with no I18N support out the door. <p><a href=""http://www.100shiki.com/archives/2007/05/linebuzz.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.100shiki.com/archives/2007/05/linebuzz.html</a><p>3 weeks later we launched an I18N release.

Things like the shift_jis character set not round-trip mapping to unicode. Not the sort of thing you can anticipate on paper. <p>If I had to do it again, I'd do it exactly the same way. Next time we may discover that the app is only used by english users and the urgent need is to fix some privacy issues. <p>Most companies that plan everything out on paper tend to have a large number of non-technical folks. MBA's and the like. When you're building a consumer web business, your business plan is expressed as a piece of technology. So why not just create the technology instead of talking about it. And instead of using english to describe your business, use Ruby or Perl or PHP or Java. <p>Mark.\nps: Sorry you feel you're getting trolled. \n",1185232987

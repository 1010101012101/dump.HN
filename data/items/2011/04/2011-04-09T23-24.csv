If Google can get normal people to vote up good results, the intentional spammers will never make a big enough dent to matter anyway. And even if they can't, the user votes won't make up the entire placement process, so hopefully they'd be no worse off now if they get useless results. Perhaps they can just leave it out of the mix entirely until they get a realistic-looking profile of user votes.",1302393507

Replacing major mechanical components on a rotary is easier than a reciprocating engine. As long as the associated systems are also simple, the rotary is one of the easiest engines there is to repair.<p>Most work that has to be done on car engines has nothing to do with the engine itself, but control, ignition and fuel delivery systems. Older rotaries had carburetors, which required regular adjustments to keep in tune. As mentioned above, the third-generation RX-7 had a complicated twin-turbo system that created some reliability problems of its own. Non-turbocharged fuel-injected second-generation RX-7s on the other hand are some of the most reliable and low-maintenance sports cars ever produced.",1302393019

2428413,comment,2427957,2428249,6,0,fourk,,,"There were a number of factors involved in my decision to drop out. At the root were family/financial issues, although these were not dire enough that I was forced, per se, to drop out. At the end of the day it came down to the school's limitations on how much CS I could learn. The school is very small (1300 undergrads), with very few of the students interested in pursuing CS in any real depth. I have only great things to say about the two professors in the department, but due to lack of student interest in the programs, there are few advanced classes available. Looking at the 2010-2011 Course Catalog (<a href=""http://www.slc.edu/undergraduate/study/science-mathematics/computer-science/courses.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slc.edu/undergraduate/study/science-mathematics/c...</a>), there are only two CS courses available (one for each semester) which require the student to have some prerequisite experience/knowledge (Databases and Robotics).<p>The other limitation you're faced with are the credit caps. SLC is a liberal arts school where, regardless of what you study, you can only receive a Bachelor of Arts degree. They cap you at 80 credits in Science/Mathematics, with a maximum of 50 of those coming from Computer Science courses. At the time I dropped out, I had 40 CS credits and 50 Science/Math Credits. Presuming I had stayed on for the additional year and a half to get a degree, I would have been limited to taking only 10 of my remaining 45 credits in what I genuinely wanted to be learning. Given the cost of the school (the most expensive school in the US), I felt that I would be better off 1.5 years down the line by getting paid to learn what I wanted to be learning, rather than paying to learn things that I didn't, simply for the sake of a degree.<p>It's actually been 1.5 years since I made this decision, I would have graduated next month, and I have absolutely no regrets about having made the decision I did. I'd like to make a blog post sometime about everything that's happened in the past year and a half. I've been considering finishing my degree at some point because there are a few fundamentals courses that I missed (Algorithms, Compilers, to name a few). I'm sort of torn at this point between making the decision to do it continuing to work 9-5 for the next 2+ years while taking courses online to get a degree, or whether I'm better off making the plunge back into an 70 hour a week startup lifestyle which leaves no room for online edu. I'm unsure of which leaves me in a better position 2 years from now. Have any of you finished an education online while working? Were you happy you did so?",1302392420

The TXT record you get back would be the server's response signed with the C&C server's private key.

Fuck Groklaw.<p>Groklaw was like a big, angry shark gobbling up all of the material that a half-dozen journalists in open source and technology journalism would have loved to cover, had they not been emasculated by editors who were in love with PJ. It was a big ego game for her, not to achieve fame, but to achieve some level of personal satisfaction. It was always my hunch that she was filling some empty void in her life with Groklaw -- mommy and daddy made her feel useless, so Groklaw was her way of fighting back. Or she had an abusive husband and Groklaw was her only power in the world. Whatever. It doesn't matter now.<p>Apparently all the PJ lovers missed the posts where she promoted religion, and called for the censorship of OSTG/OSDN journalists because NewsForge published an editorial about being okay with using proprietary software, and told people that it wasn't okay for kids to believe in Santa Claus. PJ executed hit jobs on anyone who publicly disagreed with her or her ideology.<p>She reveled in that power. She had the entire tech journalism establishment by the balls, and she wasn't afraid to use that to satisfy her personal vendettas. Anybody who questioned PJ in the least was accused from every angle of being a Microsoft or SCO shill, or taking money from some front company. Anyone who asked who PJ was and how she was making her living (perfectly valid questions -- the same ones she asked of everyone who spoke out against her or did anything she didn't like) was subjected to an Anonymous-style attack from her community of blind followers. One person even claimed to have been the victim of arson at the hands of a Groklaw fan, but nobody could print those stories because PJ had a stranglehold on the tech news publishers. Nobody was allowed to publish anything <i>about</i> Groklaw.<p>Except of course the one rogue publication that did the same thing to PJ that she did to her enemies. PJ deserved what Maureen O'Gara dished up to her -- and more. There were so few actual journalists in that industry anyway... everyone was either starfucking Groklaw and promoting Linux and the FSF with fluff pieces, or they were prevented by editors from chasing stories that showed those shadow-gods in a negative light. Had Groklaw never existed, open source and Linux journalism would have been so much better for it... there would have been real story-chasers, not free software worshippers and fanboys.",1302391458

I don't know in USA but in Spain and a big part of the world that is the normal way of telling someone how to go to a place, is not so strange that another human being has the same idea than you about doing with a computer what you do without it.<p>That is the main problem about software patents, people want to have a monopoly over ideas a lot of people spontaneously have.",1261647958

There's only so many times you can have one on one conversations to get the wow across.<p>I just wish writing documentation didn't take so long, and video shoots didn't eat up whole days.

I have no idea how long Google has been working on this, but it was likely quite some time (which is probably why the solicited help from that company in the first place...)<p>I'd really be curious to know what the truth is here. Landmark nagivation is an unbelievably big project, and Google is doing it at pretty large scale. It may have very well taken a couple of years to build the thing (not so much the programming, but rather building the data-set itself).",1261646485

1013602,comment,1013545,1013545,0,0,illumen,,,"This reminded me of google advertising about 'Chrome by google' on big billboards in London.  My first thought was 'they are not giving credit to everyone else who did the work on chrome'.  Maybe it should have been 'Chrome - an open source project by google'.<p>There is no advertising clause, but claiming that it is by google is still a big lie considering big parts were not written or designed by them.  Including the main part - webkit/khtml, the html renderer.<p>Especially with open source projects, getting credit for your work may be the only thing you get.  Giving credit is a gentle(wo)mans thing to do.<p>In academia this would be plagiarism... but in business, it seems to be business as usual.  Business can get in trouble for giving credit, but academia gets in trouble for not giving credit.",1261645381

Mercurial's bookmarks are pretty much git-style branches under a different name, for example. And even though they're provided by an extension they're really not anything fancy: they're just a thin layer of UI on top of normal hg operations (in hg terms, bookmarks just boil down to a way to name -- and thus jump to, merge from, etc. -- heads in the repository).",1261645305

I've got mixed feelings on it. I spent a couple years of no caffeine from 2004 to 2006 or so, and I was pretty effective then too. Caffeine helps when you're seriously burning midnight oil on a deadline, less so otherwise, but there's probably lots of literature around on the topic.",1261645271

There are exceptions but they tend to be rare and temporary, because hardware vendors don't want customers switching to x86 just because foo app doesn't run on their architecture, and for open source apps the hardware vendors can fix it themselves.<p>Meanwhile Linux is about the only sensible thing you can currently install on the vast expanse of old PowerPC Macs that can't run current versions of MacOS but can run current versions of Ubuntu or Debian, so any that get recycled into a personal server or a DVR box or whatever will have users pointing out any problems and requesting they be fixed.<p>And for the most part portability is portability: If you find x86 assembly somewhere and replace it with portable C and an ifdef to use the asm only on x86, or fix an endian issue, you haven't just fixed it for PowerPC or SPARC, you've fixed it for everyone.<p>This, incidentally, is why having a single architecture is so unhealthy: It promotes everyone forgetting about portability entirely, which prevents new, better architectures from taking hold merely because it's so much more work to port the existing installed base of software.",1359399577

You can actually fail a math course if you don't understand any of it. If you fail an English course, you typically get a C.<p>Also, while I think STEM majors are more valuable, I would argue that it's a sign of cultural decline that English and history majors often <i>can't</i> get quality jobs.

The C11 implementation is similar but not identical.</i><p>There are so many problems with this. Yet another slightly different string manipulation function? Why not standardize on one of the already existing ones, such as strlcat/strlcpy? I can see people making some big mistakes with strcat_s, since the size passed is the number of unused characters left in s1, not the size of s1. And strcpy_s can cause a segfault if given an s1max that is greater than the size of s2. Why not only copy up to the first null character?<p>Also, these functions have the same name as the VC++ functions, but behave differently. In VC++, strcat_s takes the size of s1, not the space remaining. People are going to google for strcat_s, read the MSDN docs, and unknowingly add buffer overflows to their code.<p>Finally, these functions have annoying behavior. If they hit the limits passed to them, they erase s1. No best-effort. No copy whatever fits. Just destroy the data in the destination string.<p>strlcat/strlcpy solve all of the problems I've mentioned.

5129927,comment,5128748,5128959,3,0,bathat,,,"> One item to consider, Tesla is only going the route of battery powered cars. The majors are investigating multiple different sources, hydrogen, natural gas, compressed air, battery only, simple hybrid, and series hybrids. So as for stepping up their game I am not sure what you think they need to do.<p>I don't see how that benefits the incumbents.  Unfortunately, the realities of physics and economics (to say nothing about total pollution generated) mean that there are really only two choices: Burn liquid hydrocarbons; or store electricity in a battery (or some combination of the two).  Tesla is currently pursing the second option and traditional auto manufacturers are using both.  Hydrogen, natural gas and compressed air have all the limitations of batteries and more: The technology that goes in the car is more expensive, the infrastructure is more expensive and exists in fewer places (excluding natural gas), range is short, and 'refuling' times are long.<p>About ten years ago, as an undergrad, I worked on an NSF- and DOE-funded project to use single-walled carbon nanotubes both as a catalyst in hydrogen fuel cells and for hydrogen storage.  Unfortunately, the efficiency gains were minimal, and I'm not aware of much[1] progress that has been made since (but I now work in a different sub-field).  That means that a practical fuel cell, big enough to power a lightweight vehicle still costs hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars (mostly due to the requirement for large amounts of platinum to catalyze the H2 in to 2H).  Frankly, there has been enough money wasted on pie-in-the-sky projects when there is already-existing technology that works (lithium-ion batteries).<p>If you don't trust a random stranger on the Internet, then please trust the managers of auto companies.  Honda has effectively abandoned their FCX Clairity project because it is cheaper to meet CARB (CA Air Resources Board) requirements by buying zero-emissions credits from Toyota, Tesla, or GM.  The FCX, by the way, was a hybrid that only used a fuel cell to meet the average load for electricity and batteries to meet the peak load.<p>[1] You need <i>at least</i> an order of magnitude better catalyst performance before you can even <i>consider</i> using PEM fuel cells in a mass-produced car.  Every time I've seen a press release about better fuel cells, they seem to mention a few percent.  At the current rate of improvement, it will take a quarter of a century before we even solve one of the show-stoppers for hydrogen cars.",1359398804

Even though it is harder to find jobs with those majors right now, they are not necessarily easy majors. In fact, depending on your talents,these majors can be very hard. Taking me as an example, I can never imagine myself majoring in English or Journalism because I dislike writing and I have never done too well in my English courses. To me these two majors would be harder than Math and Chemistry. On the other hand, my friend who is a history major is naturally good at writing but has very difficult times understanding Math related materials. I always admire her for her writing skills and always ask her for help when it comes to writing application and essays. She always wishes that she could be good at Math.\nAlso what majors make good money also depends on the time we are living in. I don't know about American history but I know in Chinese history during the 1910s,people with arts majors would make more money. At that times, China was going through an intellectual revolution in which Western ideas were being introduced.

Without even getting into some of the deeper conversations, there are only so many ""better"" jobs to go around. 80% of the jobs out there pay less than $50K per year, and just $45K per year for 75% of the jobs. Meanwhile, if you are aged 25-29, 30% of your peers have a degree. Therefore, 33% of college graduates in that age group are basically guaranteed to make less than $50K per year and many of them will fail to even make the $45K threshold. Not to mention that in reality, percentage is even larger than that as a significant number of non-college graduates live in the top 25% of earners.<p>Furthermore, 18% of university graduates fail to even earn $20K per year and just 24% of the top 1% have a non-graduate degree as their highest level of education attainment. I see no compelling reason to even begin to think you would go to college to get a better job, unless that job is in a specific field where the law requires (doctor, lawyer, etc.) Someone still has to drive the taxis. Having a degree doesn't put you above such work and the more people obtain their degrees, the greater chance someone with a degree will take on such work.<p>With that said, college still has merit and should not be discounted. Finding a job at the end should be one of the last reasons you consider attending.",1359398184
5129862,comment,5127983,5129573,2,0,robomartin,,,"Please. I am not dissing architecture.  Not by a long-shot.  I have been part of very large projects ($15 million dollars?) that involved such things as architectural work on a ten story commercial building as well as the design and installation of the technical infrastructure (server and other stuff).  As the director of engineering of such projects I oversaw all of it and, yes, interfaced with architects and all of the trades involved.  I have always been a very hands-on guy, so I get this stuff at the elemental level.  For example, on one of these projects I jumped at the opportunity to improve my welding skills.  A couple of us came in over a weekend and, armed with our MIG welders, welded-up the seismic sub-floor supports for the server racks.  Hard work, but very rewarding.<p>Fundamentally architecture and software engineering can be very similar.  The basics of both arts don't really change a whole lot.  However, in software engineering, you can't possibly go ten years --maybe not even five these days-- without learning piles and piles of new stuff just to remain viable and competitive.  If you've done this a few times you tend to get pretty good at adopting new frameworks and paradigms.  That's why I said that, to an experienced software developer, something like iOS is just another platform.<p>Both arts do suffer from the same problem: naive clients.  That will probably never change.  I've had discussions with clients about to commit to a ten million dollar facility project who, as you said, expected to be able to do all the TI for $35 per square foot.  Right.<p>The one advantage that you have is that there is no way to outsource huge chunks of your work.  A client can't come up and say that they heard they can get the framing done in India for 1/10th. of the money.  Yes, they can bring up this or that contractor, cousin, friend who can do it for half the money, but there are limits.<p>I just got done adding a new room to my house.  I took the opportunity to teach my son about home remodeling and construction.  Frankly, in the end, it probably cost me more than what a contractor would have charged me.  This is particularly true if you consider opportunity cost.  Of course, there was the ulterior motive of using it as an opportunity to educate.  From that perspective alone it was worth it.<p>Kids are growing-up without knowing how to make things.  Legos are neat, but they present an idealized version of making stuff.  I find that whenever I talk to a client who has no experience building anything at all they tend to be the most unreasonable and clueless people.  I always ask them what hobbies they have.  If they are into woodworking, model airplanes, art or other hobbies where you experience the process of creating something from scratch I usually know I am going to be able to have a reasonable conversation with them.<p>Here's a true story:  I was working on the layout of some racks over a custom computer floor.  The investor's wife came into the room and was looking over my shoulder.  After several questions she points at the AutoCAD printout and asks me why the holes under the racks were not larger.  I explained that given the number of cables that had to enter this rack the holes were fine.  We were only going to use 30% of the capacity --a 3x safety margin.  The next day I get an irate call from the investor telling me that he was going to sue us if the holes were not large enough in the future.  He was a friggin stock broker who'd never built a damn thing in his life.<p>What did we do?  Of course, the holes became as large as the footprint of the racks.  And, yes, I made him sign a piece of paper that exonerated us of any responsibility stemming from the lack of structural support due to the way they wanted us to cut-up the floor.  Sometimes there are battles you just can't win, particularly when ignorance is involved.",1359398183

5129860,comment,5129169,5129169,5,0,just2n,,,"Re-commenting on OP @ author's request:<p>The article really isn't about speed, it's more that engineers shouldn't necessarily take mathematical results as the end-all to their considerations when developing an algorithm. In particular, what is considered ""best"" in theory is not necessarily the best choice in a given program.<p>Math is important to formulating algorithms, since it can provide, in theory, a closed form solution for something typically done iteratively (the example here: fibonacci numbers). But you still need to verify when an algorithm is going to be correct, and more importantly, appropriate. In this case, it's pretty well known how inaccurate floats and doubles can be within X significant figures, and this is why I've always said the analytical solution doesn't really work on a computer unless you have a CAS library that can approximate an exact answer to an arbitrary number of significant figures (and it still won't be accurate if shoved into a float/double afterwards). So there's a trade-off, and choosing the theoretically best solution (a closed form solution) isn't necessarily the best possible choice for the task. In this case, yes, as others have pointed out, if we only need the first 96 fibonacci numbers, ever, it makes more sense to pre-compute them. However, if we only do the computation once in the entire program, even that doesn't necessarily make sense. It entirely depends on the application, but that's the entire point: a closed form for fibonacci numbers isn't the end of considerations.<p>I am curious though, why is it so many people are oblivious that there's an O(logN) time algorithm to compute fibonacci numbers iteratively on integers? It's a beautiful piece of math, and very simple so everyone should understand it. Just notice that:<p><pre><code>    ((1, 1), (1, 0))^N -> ((f_{N+1}, f_N), (f_N, f_{N-1}))\n</code></pre>\ngiven N > 0, where f_N denotes the Nth fibonacci number. For SW engineers who are actively interviewing: does anyone still ask you to write a function to compute the Nth fibonacci number in technical interviews?",1359398157

It will reduce the breaking ability if the batteries are too cold or if they are full (and the standard charge mode only goes to 90%, so it rarely is a cause). When breaking is reduced (or acceleration is too), the car shows a dashed yellow line on the current gauge. So, there is an indicator and you can know to expect the reduced breaking force.<p>Regardless, it's by far the best car I've ever owned.

I would like to see the same statistic, but with Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, EE, Mechanical Eng., etc all in their own buckets.<p>There seems to be some kind of outrage that you can go to a good school and get a 4 year degree and end up working with people who just graduated high-school.  New grads were probably led up the garden path and not given realistic expectations.  On the other hand everybody knows there are no jobs for English, Communications, Journalism, or any of the various 'Unemployment Studies' programs.  Everyone knows this, it's past common knowledge and well on it's way to becoming a cliche.<p>Basically, I guess you can boil down what I'm saying as, ""If you partied in college, and didn't take classes that were hard: you didn't learn anything, and that is why nobody will pay you for access to your training.""<p>It used to be that certain kinds of jobs were reserved for a 'college man', but that was because that was synonymous with white and upper middle to upper class.  The great liar, statistics, said that a college degree was highly correlated with lots of great outcomes, higher income, better employment, etc.  The government started laying lots of money into getting everyone to go to college, without realizing that people weren't paying for the college part of college grads, they were paying for the stuff that college was correlated with.  Like if the British started sending more people to Eton because they wanted to increase the size of the royal family.<p>These days who you know matters as much as ever.  However, and this is kind of new, since the 20th century (or post Edison anyway), you can have a very comfortable and low risk life regardless of where you started, if you can learn enough technical stuff.  Rich people and companies will pay to rent your brain all day.  They will only pay, though, if your brain can do things that most brains can't, it's like anything else, value comes from scarcity.<p>So, if you are going to Harvard and your dad went to Harvard and your parents friends are as rich as they are, study whatever, you'll be fine.  If your parents had to show up to work and had a boss, or worse if you are on scholarship, for the love of god study something with some cash value.<p>I must study politics and war, that my sons may have the liberty to study mathematics and philosophy, natural history and naval architecture, in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, tapestry, and porcelain. - John Adams",1359396900

C traditionally hasn't had subsetting, so ""standard C"" code is supposed to compile correctly on any conforming implementation. If your code is ""standard C99"", any conformant C99 compiler is supposed to compile it correctly; and otherwise, you can't assume that (for example, you may be consciously using a GCC extension, which is ok, or relying on implementation-defined behavior, which is usually bad).<p>But if you write C11 that uses VLAs, it seems like it's still standard C11, sort of: VLAs aren't merely a vendor-specific extension, like the GCC extensions are, but an optional C11 feature which hasn't been deprecated. Nonetheless, a conforming C11 compiler doesn't have to accept your code, so in that sense your code isn't really ""standard C11"". Will there be more fine-grained names for the different subsets of the standard features, so you can say that such code is compliant with ""maxi-C11"" but not with ""core C11"" or something?",1359396841

If you are like I was, an unemployed guy trying to start its own business with a few equally unemployed associates, you applied for the ACCRE subvention which was, at that time (2005) the worst piece of bureaucratic form I ever experienced. Then you get a load of accounting obligations. The ""siege social"" was at my own address and I had to move after a while, which produced another round of bureaucracy hoopla to change the business address. It took some time and the post office was refusing to give me my mail as long as I couldn't give a Kbis with the new address. I haven't had the chance to have employees before the business collapsed, but what I've read about what to do when you hire people and the risk you take was very untempting.<p>Now the things has apparently been better, and a new very simplified status has been created for one-person businesses (the ""auto-entrepreneur""). It is my status right now and it is quite fine. But if I start earning too much money (more than 30K euros a year) I'm forced to change my status and go trough all this again.",1363359466

5380907,comment,5379801,5380055,1,0,talmand,,,"Compared with what's out there, Steam's DRM is quite reasonable. The main reason is that you can install your games as many times as you want on as many computers as you want, it just attempts to limit how many computers can access the game at the same time. It would be even more reasonable if it allowed two computers to be signed into the same account at the same time and allow two different games to be played at the same time. For now you have to set one computer to offline mode to make this work, but even then that's a decent compromise.<p>But the main difference with Steam is that it offers features that are beneficial to the gamer that excuses the DRM in the first place. Plus there's the fact that for the most part the DRM is hidden from the gamer, it just works.<p>Although, it does allow for another third-party DRM to be involved which just sucks. Especially when the extra DRM actually cancels out features of Steam such as limited number of installs. The worst is when a game is on Steam and has Windows for Live involved. GTAIV was just awful; sign into Steam, sign into Windows for Live, sign into Rockstar's Social Club to get full functionality. Now that's just stupid.<p>Where Steam can possibly screw their customers is if you piss off Valve for some reason then they can ban your account, which means you lose access to all of your games. But this policy exists on other similar platforms such as Origin. Personally I think this would eventually not hold up in court as I can see them removing your access to a particular game for some reason, but not the whole collection you paid for. Especially since Steam is a delivery platform; it would be as if you did a credit card chargeback on the game store that cheated you in some way and then they somehow took back every game you ever bought from them. But so far, this type of case hasn't entered into the court system as far as I know.",1363359459

I've wanted for a long time to make the time to add a always-on cpu and memory profiler to Chicken Scheme that just tallys the ""return"" addresses during the gc, meaning at each cg cycle you have a pretty darn good tracing profiler, and keeps the ""return"" addresses in cells when they are moved off stack, so at any moment you can blame your memory usage on particular code.

In this case its 10s of Japanese publishers, few of whom have US presences.  Don't know the law there, but unless the publishers' lawyers were incompetent their liability is limited.  I.e. an obvious way is to arrange a package deal to keep transaction costs low for jmanga to buy limited rights to publish derivative works as they did.  On the other hand, if the publishers engaged in serious control over jmanga.com's operations there could be openings.<p>Given the foreign country aspect, Japan Inc. being very unfriendly towards lawsuits, and I suspect relatively small sales (their MVP wasn't particularly viable, and lots of people recognized the trap) I wouldn't expect anyone to try in this case.  But I do wonder why no one has in previous cases like this, aside from avoiding going after behemoths like Microsoft when the potential payoff was probably very small (and e.g. Microsoft did offer a path to keep your songs, albeit at some quality loss ... and I can imagine a Microsoft lawyer asking a plaintiff ""And you kept the volume turned up to 11?

5380847,comment,5378462,5379701,2,0,notpsychologist,,,"I've had a similar experience, although not nearly as challenging as yours. I believe you do need to seek help. But in the meantime, I'll share what's worked for me, so that you can give it a shot. You'll really just have to find what works for you.<p>I got some help during college, but unfortunately for me, medication would lead to very high blood pressure (probably combined with stress and other factors at the time and due to a predisposition that runs in the family) so I stopped taking them after a couple of months.<p>I have found that I don't need them as much though. Like danenania suggests, your problem is likely one of body chemistry that few understand (kind of like depression), and one especially of brain chemistry. I've tried l-tyrosine only and haven't really noticed much change, but try it (GNC has it). What's really helped me, specially lately -- and when I look back at High School -- is exercise. Exercise, exercise, exercise. I have found for me, that exercising intensely even for 10 minutes (though more is ideal) during the morning is an excellent way for me to feel very focused and energetic the rest of the day. The key is intensity.<p>So here's what I suggest, especially since you like extreme sports:\n* wake up early -- it's not easy with ADD, I know, but sleep early the first night before it.\n* hit the gym, or visit to your favorite jogging place\n* Run your guts out!<p>Jog at a good pace for ~4 minutes after stretching a bit and walking one minute. The 5th minute, sprint/run as fast as you can without stopping. Then walk for 1-1.5 mins, and do at least one other set of this, but ideally 3. (As always, build up to it an adapt to yourself--as long as you really push yourself for one minute). What also works for me is also listening to music that gives you a ""braingasm"" during your sprints -- I love Radiohead's ""Weird fishes"", for example, because it's a great song and is conveniently 5 minutes long. Best of all it has the lines ""I hit the bottom and escape"" during the last minute--during my sprints. This seems to release dopamines (I feel a great rush) AND pushing yourself beyond the point when you want to quit will also build will power. I try to do this at least 3x a week and unless I stay up (sleeping well is also key!), I always look forward to this because of how great I feel the rest of the day. Working out intensely has also been great for my body weight, and for reducing stress -- which means less stress eating and less impulsiveness (it's a feedback loop). Just walking isn't that great for stress (which you need to take care of first). You really, really have to push your body beyond its limits.<p>Once you take care of your stress, I'll echo others: find what you're passionate about. If your passionate about engineering, but hate some classes like I did, get help on those classes (do study groups, office hours, etc). And take what you learn in the courses you love and build something great with it.",1363358897

5380842,comment,5380083,5380773,3,0,jasonkester,,,"Moving to contract work is pretty straightforward.  It's essentially just finding a new job.  Lots of places prefer to hire contractors for individual projects, so it's not too tough to pick up a 3/6/9 month contract someplace.<p>Most contractors tend to try to move from one contract to the next with as little downtime as possible, or work for an agency that sorts it all out for them.  For me, the downtime was the big payoff, since contracting pays roughly double what a salaried job does.  If you have no attachments, you can spend a fair amount of time slacking off before picking up another contract.  I used to push it as far as 9 months off between 3 month contracts and still put plenty into savings.<p>Repeat the above enough times, and you'll be able to break off work that doesn't require you to be on site, or pick up work from new clients from word of mouth.  Some people refer to this as freelancing, but then they don't get to charge as much if they use that term in front of a client.

The method of claim 1, wherein the multi-pipe synthetic file opened by the at least one other application is limited to only being used in the mode directed by the master application and wherein the at least one other application is not able to send any control messages.<p>3. The method of claim 1, wherein the mode that the at least one other applications open the multi-pipe synthetic file in is dependent on the multi-pipe operation requested by the master application.<p>4. The method of claim 1, wherein the MULTI-PIPE file system module is implemented as at least one of user space file servers, embedded within the operating system itself as built-in file systems, or a set of dynamically loaded modules.<p>5. The method of claim 1, where the MULTI-PIPE synthetic file system is constructed to allow allocation of new instances of the plurality of multi-pipe synthetic files via user action, either by leveraging existing file-system interfaces or by using a synthetic control file which the plurality of applications sends commands to allocate new instances of the plurality of multi-pipe synthetic files.<p>6. The method of claim 1, wherein any application writing a message with a header-control block is directed to a specific enumerated reader queue where the message will be received by a specific application when read from the multi-pipe file.<p>7. The method of claim 1, wherein the master application writing a broadcast message to the multi-pipe synthetic file triggers a copy of the broadcast message to be delivered to all applications in the group communications reading from the multi-pipe synthetic file by encoding a broadcast flag in the header-control block.<p>8. The method of claim 1, where different ones of the at least one other application are isolated from one another by the MULTI-PIPE synthetic file system enabling application appropriate multiplexing without the limitations of native file system I/O multiplexing of the operating system and wherein, in non-enumerated multi-pipe synthetic files, individual ones of the at least one other application reading from the multi-pipe synthetic file receive complete messages in a round robin fashion from the master application without fragmented messages being intermixed.<p>9. The method of claim 1, where the master application changes the multi-pipe synthetic file system name of the multi-pipe synthetic file by writing to the header-control block of the multi-pipe synthetic file and wherein the master application clears the specification of the multi-pipe operation of the multi-pipe synthetic file by writing to the header-control block of the multi-pipe synthetic file.<p>10. The method of claim 1, wherein: all of the at least one other application opening the multi-pipe synthetic file are blocked until a first predetermined number of the at least one other application are blocked as specified by the master application in the header-control block written to the multi-pipe synthetic file by the master application, all of the at least one other application reading the multi-pipe synthetic file are blocked until a second predetermined number of the at least one other application reading the multi-pipe synthetic file are blocked as specified by the master application in the header-control block written to the multi-pipe synthetic file by the master application, all of the at least one other application writing the multi-pipe synthetic file are blocked until a third predetermined number of the at least one other application writing the multi-pipe synthetic file are blocked as specified by the master application in the header-control block written to the multi-pipe synthetic file by the master application, the master application writing a control message to the multi-pipe file synthetic file is blocked until a fourth predetermined number of the at least one other application have closed the multi-pipe synthetic file as specified by the master application in the header-control block written to the multi-pipe synthetic file by the master application, and the master application writes a reduction control message to the multi-pipe synthetic file, a subsequent read on the multi-pipe synthetic file by the master application will block until all of the at least one other applications which have opened the multi-pipe synthetic file for writing to the multi-pipe synthetic file write a value to the multi-pipe synthetic file forming a set of values and the MULTI-PIPE file system module reduces the set of values and returns a result of the reduction to the master application and wherein all of the at least one other applications receive the result of the reduction from the MULTI-PIPE file system module.""",1363358801

Some pirate because they can't get it otherwise (ex. region exclusions, see Game of Thrones), some because they want to try out a game but there is no trial, and some because they don't want to deal will all the stupid ads and <i>Don't pirate</i> crap on DVD's now (SEE: <a href=""http://bit.ly/eriKlB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/eriKlB</a>) as well as broken DRM management (Sony Music CD's anyone)<p>Companies <i>try</i> to hurt pirates with DRM but all they hurt are the paying customers, who do not have it easier.  The recent fiasco with SimCity is a perfect example of that.  Paying customers got screwed because of EA's DRM scheme.<p>And the long term effect of Steams DRM has yet to be proven.  If Steam goes under and we lose all the games we paid for does that still qualify as reasonable or completely borked?<p>I get that companies want to protect their assets, but applying 19th processes to a 21st century reality is never, ever going to work.",1363358243

Sadly your commentary is an example of this. Immigration is not a problem to the welfare state (it has been shown that new immigrants pay off for what they obtain) and socialists are not the only culprits when the welfare state you're complaining about takes its origin in conservative De Gaulle era and more than 2/3 of the national debt originates from years when right-wing governments were in power.<p>France needs to change its course, of course. Off the top of my head, I can cite two or three reforms that are badly needed: adopt the ""flexicurity"" Scandinavian system with flexible hiring/firing and great investment of the state in helping people finding job again, to reduce risks for employers and prevent people to fall in the shitty long-term unemployment; reform entirely the unfair and ineffective tax system to get rid of loopholes and reduce the tax rate and pay for welfare with progressive income tax instead of get money from poor worker's salary. These are centrists policies and despite all the shit thrown in political discourse right now, they have slightly better chance to be implemented by the current Socialist Party in power (which is very centrist in acts, albeit not in speech) than by what the main right wing party is currently heading to right now.

Triads are nice in their ambiguity as to where they are going (and their sonic simplicity), and when a seventh or a sixth note is added, it generally tells you where the chord is headed.<p>EGs: I I I6 V V V V7 I vs. I I I Imaj7 IV IV IV IV6 I<p>Sixth chords move up a fifth, seventh chords move down a fifth. (the seventh of a chord falls, the sixth rises - one can also view the IV7 chord in blues music that moves to the I to be a IV+6)<p>The fundamental tetrad concept introduces the idea of ""homophonic chords"" - for example, a major sixth chord and a minor seventh chord have the exact same pattern, and the designation depends on context. Often, two designations exist in a superposition until it is settled later on (or never).<p>Also interesting is chordal metamorphosis, where for example a subtle shift in notes can modulate you into a new mode -for example, V morphing into III7 by chromatically altering a note, taking you from major mode to relative minor. (and this particular V III7 change is a nice way to make a strong chord change when stuck on an already strong chord)\nEG: Hallelujah - |I |IV V |vi |IV |V |III7 |vi |<p>Music theory is a very interesting topic, and I've arrived at models that do a pretty good job of explaining the underworkings, allowing me to appreciate the beauty of songs analytically as well as emotionally.",1363357968

The Viennese people all praise how well there city works, but if you've lived in another place for a while you quickly notice all the things going terribly wrong there.<p>To bring a few counter-points to the praises listed on the web site:<p>You want to work at a startup? Great! But don't go to Vienna then. There are a few startups, but most of them finance themselves via part-time consulting work, as the chances of getting ""real"" investments are quite low. And almost all of the successful ones that I know move to places like London or Berlin as soon as possible.<p>Salaries are low. And I mean low. If you're used to salaries at places like SF you're probably paying more for your apartment in those places than what you're net income in Vienna would be. And forget about stock options, even at the so called ""startups"" there they are quite rare.<p>It feels like almost everyone smokes in Vienna. If you're ever going to a restaurant or a bar, even if it's only a brief visit, be prepared to wash all of your clothing afterwards. There are practically no laws protecting non-smokers, although those are nowadays standard in most other modern cities.<p>It rains almost all the time. There are something like 2 months of summer and 2 months of winter. The remainder of the time is cloudy rainy weather. So yes, there would be a few nice places where you could do stuff outside, but only during the short summer time. And don't expect any clean parks where you just can lie down and enjoy the sun (like in SF). Most of the city parks are dirty. And most people don't clean up after their dogs, so you wouldn't want to lie down in those parks anyway.",1363357413

For the use case that they were put into that phone (and the price point it implies), I am unsure whether data reported from these phones will be useful for PressureNet.<p>Longer explanation: in the parlance used for pressure measurement, a barometer is a low-pressure absolute gauge (although what they pack in the phone is a sensor or transducer rather than a full gauge for obvious reasons).  In order to measure absolute pressure, it needs to pack a good source of vacuum to be used as one of the differential inputs.  And it needs to do it real small and real cheap.  I suspect they're using a piezoresistive or capacitative sensor for this pressure range, which both have a significant tempco, and they almost certainly can't do a valid temp-comp on the part for cost reasons (you can sort of bullshit it by characterizing the lead unit and applying that to everything based on a curve fit, but the results are not great).<p>Sensors in this form factor and for this price point might be accurate to within +- 2.5%, which is not terribly useful for a barometer for weather purposes.",1363356998

The damage to the name however, is already done. Now I avoid DRM like the plague.<p>Not really, it flakes out fairly often, initiating a 10-20 min process of restarting Steam and the game, which is pretty annoying for me because I try to allow myself a specific and limited amount of time for playing games.

The common sticking point of freedom of movement is not some nice to have thing. Without it there can be no common market. Likewise, the harmonization of (relevant) laws is not some nice to have thing. That's hard political work that has to be done to reach the goal and doing it without a political structure on the EU level is unrealistic.

Sure, you can transpose them to a common key (as they've done here), but at that point, it's not  really the same song anymore. \nAlso, I've found that chord progressions can be quite flexible if only 'snip-its' of certain songs are being used, namely the standard chorus or verse. Much of the genius of songwriting comes in transitions or bridges.<p>I'm not denying this is not entertaining, and it works to an extent, but I would say that there is a degree to which this hinges on the widespread renown of these songs. It's not so easy to say they would have become so popular if they were all written in the same key, and not the one of the original artist.<p>Pop music is frequently spoken down upon, that it's 'talent-less' or 'garbage', but it really is like any other expert discipline - if it were so easy, there wouldn't be such a saturation of experts dominating the field. My opinion most of the talent is in production - Dr. Luke, Red One, Max Martin, etc.",1363356103

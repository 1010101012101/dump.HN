From Microsoft's perspective, it is difficult to see producing the latest greatest browser as a key strategic goal  - that's not to say that a solid competent browser suitable for businesses and acceptable as a default by ordinary consumers is not important.<p>For Microsoft the browser features which are critical are quite different from those of other browser providers - Microsoft needs a browser which above all provides a large degree of predictability, stability, and automation for enterprise and business - pursuing Google's new release every week strategy would be counter productive to Microsoft's need to provide a browser which is well integrated into their technology stack. Consumer choice will never drive Microsoft's browser  development (hence we don't see IE for OSX or Linux).<p>The idea that Microsoft losing browser market share is a disaster lacks an explanation of why.  IE's market dominance was a liability for Microsoft (e.g. the EU settlement) and IE itself is largely a cost center not a revenue generator - how many consumers upgraded from XP just for IE9 and how much revenue did that generate relative to the amount  Microsoft spent on supporting IE6 over the years?<p>If Microsoft was like Google or Mozilla, the loss in browser market share would affect their bottom line.

You learn about: consumer behavior, the nature of black markets, iOS piracy tools and techniques.<p>Quick story: A friend of mine, Carl Lydon, created www.chamberofchat.com, which is an 3D chat-room for Harry Potter Fans that became popular in the early 2000s. This chat-room was promptly infiltrated by a nefarious hacker who assigned himself moderator status and began spewing filth, casting elimination spells, and harassing innocent chatters. At first Carl freaked out but got a hold of himself and re-built a few key modules of his multiplayer log-in code. By the end, the hacker went away, and Carl learned more about security than he <i>ever</i> could have from any one else. A gold-mine of lessons. A fine-art school graduate, he now makes a fortune programming multiplayer online games. Piracy is a gift.<p>(edit formatting)",1307371136

In return for that government granted monopoly period, the copyrighted work then goes into the public domain where market forces and competition determine the new price of the good or service. This is the public's incentive to grant a temporary monopoly. Piracy is running rampant because the laws have been manipulated and skewed in favor of the content generators so their work get all the protections but no longer ever fall into the public domain.

2624766,comment,2624331,2624331,23,0,modernerd,,,"The Internet, like DVD, VHS, cable, radio, and sheet music, is just the latest in a long line of transmission mediums.<p>Use of each medium to transmit work that was once locked down and overseen by a controlling influence has always been considered piracy when that medium was in its infancy -- right back to sheet music -- as Cory Doctorow notes in a video interview with the Guardian[1]:<p>""The copyright wars aren't new, of course. In the first part of the 20th century you had sheet music composers who represented the only real 'music industry'. They were an industry as a pose to a trade because they had an industrial apparatus; a copying machine that made sheet music. And so they could sell it even when they weren't there.<p>""Then you had performers who weren't really an industry; they were just a trade, because you could only make money as a performer if you were actually performing; there was no industrial component. And then someone invented recorded music, and the performers who were buying their sheet music down at Tin Pan Alley and performing it all these years started performing it into recording devices.<p>""And the composers said, 'What are you doing? You're selling our compositions without our permission! You must stop this -- it's an act of piracy!' And the performers said, somewhat understandably, 'You sold us the sheet music, didn't you? Didn't you think we'd perform it?' And different states came up with different answers, but at the end of the day, all the countries that made the transition to having a successful recorded music industry said that composers actually don't get a say in whether or not their music is recorded. They may get some money from an automatic royalty system, but you don't get to say 'this can only be performed here' or 'only that guy can perform it'. Once it's been performed once, everyone can perform it and everyone can record it, because that's how music is.<p>""So here you have the great pirates of the first decade of the 20th century: the music performers; the record labels. And the record labels turned around, not that long afterwards, and pointed at the radio stations and said, 'What are you doing playing our records on the radio? You have no business doing it! What we did when we took those compositions without permission, that was progress! What you jerks are doing... that's just piracy!' And, of course, the broadcasters went out and they said, 'no, you should let us broadcast' and they eventually won that fight and then <i>they</i> were the brave pirates who became the main stream.<p>""And so when cable channels started taking broadcast signals and pumping them over cable wires, the broadcasters said, 'Well, you know, when we took that music from the record labels that was progress, but when you take our radio diffusion and pump it down over a cable that's just piracy'. And the cable operators fought that fight.<p>""Then along came the VCR, which could record programmes off the cable, and the cable operators, having won the fight with the broadcasters, said, 'You know, when we took the broadcasts that was progress! When you take our cable transmissions and record them on a VHS cassette, that's piracy!""<p>""And then, the company that invented the VCR, Sony, joined with the major studios in suing the Internet for taking movies that had been diffused on DVD or VHS cassette or over the air and said, ""You know, when we put your cable diffusion on a VHS cassette, that was progress, but when you take it and put it on the Internet, that's just piracy.""<p>""The biggest difference now, I think, is the extent to which they're being taken seriously. I think it used to be true that no lawmaker believed he could be re-elected by breaking the thing that his constituents use to entertain themselves. And now there seems to be an awful willingness to go to Corfu with a music composer and come back and propose that the Internet should be censored and that people who are accused of file sharing should be locked out of it and so on. And I guess that's the major difference and the thing that gives me anxiety about the future of the Internet.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/video/2011/may/30/internet-piracy-cory-doctorow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/video/2011/may/30/in...</a>",1307369964
2624765,comment,2623845,2623980,2,0,munificent,,,"> Say I use module Dates that extends String, and module Inflections that does the same, as I want to use String#weeks and String#pluralize. But both redefine String#singular.<p>If you do an unqualified import (i.e. import everything from both modules), that will be an error (well, it <i>should</i> be, I still need to implement this). If you just need #weeks and #pluralize, you can import just those:<p><pre><code>    import Dates weeks\n    import Inflections pluralize\n</code></pre>\nIf those two methods internally call singular, that will still be OK. If you actually need access to both versions of singular, you can rename on import:<p><pre><code>    import Dates singular = Dates.singular\n    import Inflections singular = Inflections.singular\n</code></pre>\n> If I import Dates, and then import Texts as I want to use String#stemmed_terms which in turn uses Inflections?<p>That's OK since imports aren't transitive. If you import Texts, you'll just get what it <i>exports</i> not what it itself imports and uses.<p>> If I import two modules defining a same method with different signature does everything work fine?<p>...Maybe. This is probably the trickiest corner case of the language. If both of those modules share some import where that method is defined, then they will be defining specializations of the <i>same</i> multimethod and everything is fine. If those two modules are totally unrelated, then those are different multimethods entirely and you can't ""merge"" them when you import both.<p>For example, io defines an ""open"" multimethod. Let's say your module Doors also defines ""open"". In your App module, you want to import both. If Doors happens to import io, then its ""open"" is a specialization of that one, and App will be fine when it imports them both. If not, those are two different multimethods and you'll need to rename one when you import.<p>One way to look at it is that a multimethod is a bit like a virtual method (but not tied to a specific class). You can have a bunch of methods with the same name in the same module as long as they're all overriding the same base virtual method.",1307369958

2624742,comment,2624331,2624582,15,0,pathjumper,,,"That is because, right at its heart, the _universe_ does not respect owning information. Therefore it makes no sense that some subcomponent of the universe, say a person, or other entity could either.  Sure, you can own a book on which information is printed, or multiple ""copies""; that is, multiple physical books. But to the universe they are not copies, they are discrete physical entities.  But when you are only splitting energy streams, that is making electronic copies; those are true copies. And this is where the lie that is ""copyright"" steps in. Literally, ""the right to copy"". As in, some entities, typically people, have it, and some do not. The fact that a new term had to be made up to give this fictitious idea a reality illuminates how baseless it is in the actual universe outside human society.  Since the entire thing is predicated on a lie - the lie that the act of copying electronically can truly be controlled - it is intrinsic that it cannot last, since it has no basis in reality outside our minds. The would-be copyright owners sort of admit this when they try and use scare tactics to keep people from infringing on their so-called copyright. They do this with big FBI warnings (which the FBI had no hand whatsoever in creating), and those stupid ""you wouldn't steal a car, would you?"" ads. It sounds almost like someone is trying to convince _themselves_ of the veracity of owning information and the right to copy it. I, for one, think that the sooner the human race gets the hell over the idea that information can be owned, the better. There are other, better ways to make money through entertainment, and the entertainment industry is sooner or later going to have no choice but to face the music.

These statistics are biased, one-sided and misleading. That is indeed a property of some or even most statistics, just as ""being wrong"" is a property of some or even most information. Yet no-one would think to proclaim that the problem with government is that it believes information.<p>Real statistics, like real science, is a force for good. Bad statistics, like pseudoscience, is a force for bad - but it can only fool the ignorant. The solution isn't to ban statistics. It's to educate decision makers so they can tell the difference.",1307369095

I'm a bit of an amateur linguist, so it's interesting to me (though also sad - the internet is the future, so without online usage, a language has no future).<p>India has so many languages that all official business is done in English. Since (just like in every other country) computers first appeared in big businesses, only English support was needed. The types of people working at those companies are fluent in English. Most of them went to English-medium schools ever since kindergarten. All of the universities are English-medium, so if you don't learn everything in English from when you're little, you'll never stand a chance in the hypercompetitive university entrance exams.<p>This made computer adoption very easy - just get some American computers and you're good to go. No time wasted localizing anything. Localization would have been a huge problem in India (a much bigger problem than China) because there are so many languages, and they all have a different script. A veritable nightmare for computer vendors - how many types of keyboards do you have to stock and keep track of? In the cities (where computers appeared first), there would be people from all over the country, speaking and writing all kinds of different languages. There's no one language that everyone knows that you can standardize on.<p>In China, OTOH, the strong, authoritarian central government made sure that everyone was educated in one language (Mandarin), and even if they weren't, the same script is used by all the languages (since it's character-based, not phonetic-based). This means that all business in China is conducted in Mandarin, and of course, nationalistic fervor wouldn't have allowed computers to simply remain unlocalized. Moreover, the phonetic pinyin input system doesn't require keyboard localization, so the Chinese just use American keyboards as well.",1307369026

You have to have custom software that serves no other purpose than this.  You may have to hunt for codecs.  You have to make sure you're getting the right thing.  If it's a foreign film (90% of what I view) you have to dig around for subtitles which are <i>often</i> very poorly written and/or don't sync with the film properly.<p>Pirating is a pain and I think most people would pay something to avoid having to do it.

They obviously hurt someone and broke the social contract to end up there right? As children our immediate response to wrongdoing is violence because that&#x27;s the only way we know how to deal with it; she took my toy, thus I will hit her for taking it. However as adults we learn that punishment isn&#x27;t always apt, hence the decreased popularity of corporal punishment.<p>It&#x27;s asking a lot of people to make them separate their personal feelings from policy changes, and as the article shows, in America there isn&#x27;t really a buffer between informed decision-makers and the general public. Imagine we let citizens replace the FDA, instead of controlled studies we&#x27;d get people reporting how something makes them feel or how a relative of a relative said so-and-so is good for them.<p>Lastly the whole image of a criminal and the prison system is wrong: they&#x27;re often portrayed in media as tattooed scumbags and there are constant jokes about &quot;dropping the soap&quot; and getting raped in the ass. It points towards a huge dehumanization; imagine we talked about others like that, saying things like they&#x27;re getting what they deserved. Prison itself has replaced rehabilitation and it entails immoral treatment from guards and fellow inmates.",1445143955

Most people don&#x27;t realize how scary it is even to go up and down steep wheelchair ramps in a power chair (especially for elderly). Going up, as shown in the video, is one thing - going down is probably terrifying. For instance, to account for a steep decline, you have to tilt the seat back at an extreme angle. You can no longer see where you&#x27;re going! It is probably most similar to going up the lift hill on a roller coaster where you&#x27;re tilted back looking up at the sky....  except you&#x27;re going down in a direction you cannot see, you&#x27;re in full control and you can easily screw up at any moment if you get nervous and panic.

Perhaps the reason wealthier children are healthier is because their parents have discipline and work hard to provide a safe, healthy, stimulating environment for their children, which includes retaining steady gainful employment and using the proceeds from that employment to provide food, shelter, and education for the children. This will not magically happen among poor children if you give the parents some baseline income.<p>I&#x27;m not speaking in absolute terms; there is definitely some crossover with good parents who are down on their luck and bad parents who have way too much money.

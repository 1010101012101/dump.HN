2106557,comment,2104872,2105526,0,0,Xurinos,,,"Others mention the super-fast branching.  One person mentioned partial add/commits.  Someone mentioned the size difference (it is HUGE... your checkout of one SVN revision in a large repository will be six times as huge as your entire git repo and checked out files!).  There is history revision (split a commit, squash some commits together, reorder them, separate them into different branches, deploy what you want! it's like editing a document!).  The user interface is helpful and informative if you understand git lingo and version control theory; for example, if you misspell a command, git intelligently suggests commands that are similar to what you meant.  On these things alone it blows SVN out of the water.<p>But to pull a page from Linus's playbook, since no one mentioned it: git fsck.  No other SCM I am aware of can fix itself in the event of a small corruption.  I have on rare occasion had to deal with these corruptions on network shares, and a ""git fsck"" brought me back to life in a jiffy.  This is really useful for recovering work on your unshared local branches.",1295070844

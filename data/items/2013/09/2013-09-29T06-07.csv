6464387,comment,6464127,6464324,13,0,tikhonj,,,"He never said anything about <i>not</i> writing unit tests. Rather, his claim is that--even <i>with</i> unit tests--refactoring is not safe in Python et al; in Haskell and OCaml, by contrast, many of the same actions are guaranteed safe by the type system.<p>Static types do not mean you don&#x27;t have to write unit tests. But they <i>do</i> mean you can write <i>fewer</i>. (And, looking at libraries like QuickCheck, a static type system can make writing tests <i>easier</i>.)<p>Quite a bit of the safety you get in Haskell especially comes down to controlling effects. Mutable state implicitly couples all the code in a given scope--unless you&#x27;ve read and understood all of it, distinct parts might have effects on each other that you&#x27;re unaware of. In Haskell, on the other hand, this is impossible, so refactoring like extracting variables and reordering your code can be entirely safe even if you <i>haven&#x27;t</i> looked at exactly what the code does. The refactoring actions are guaranteed not to change the semantics of the code by the language itself.<p>The best way to think about it is that refactoring becomes a purely syntactic action. You just remember a few rules akin to algebra, and you can rewrite Haskell code in a bunch of different ways all preserving the original meaning. Regardless of what that meaning really is. This also extends to library code--most good libraries come with algebraic <i>laws</i>, which ensure you can rewrite their code in logical ways. Once you learn these laws, you can start doing things like changing multiple passes over a datastructure into one with the same confidence.<p>If you make a change that <i>could</i> break things, the type system will often help you find every place that <i>does</i> break. This extends beyond just type mismatches: Haskell also ensures that you consider every possible case in your functions; if you forget an option, it will give you a warning. This means it&#x27;s safe to add a new alternative to an existing type: you will get a warning everywhere you haven&#x27;t considered this new option.<p>I&#x27;ve found this to have a profound effect on how I program. With Haskell, I actually follow the rule of making any code I visit look better than before, simply because refactoring has very little mental overhead. I can move things around liberally, break them into multiple modules, condense them into fewer functions and even change the types, knowing that any mistakes I make will be caught by the type system.",1380437888

Scraping them (not that ggl makes it easy), interacting, using the website as an API, all things that matter to techies.<p>But let&#x27;s be honest : they&#x27;re ugly.

I disagree; static typing is, effectively, having an automatic set of tests automatically run for (by the compiler) you that you don&#x27;t have to run/create/maintain yourself.  As someone who&#x27;s moved from statically-typed languages to Python (2.x), I can&#x27;t count how many times I&#x27;ve made errors that &quot;should/could have been caught for me by the compiler&quot;, if there were such a thing in Python.  It slows me down in nontrivial ways.

In response they seem often to try and compensate by racheting up the enthusiasm levels, with limited success. It&#x27;s hard to trust a company pushing their newest product on you with maniacal enthusiasm - the emotional environment that attitude creates makes it virtually impossible to really enjoy a product, to feel comfortable and relaxed and as if the product truly belongs to you. This is something Apple has been really successful with, and it&#x27;s absolutely crucial if Microsoft is to host a truly creative user community which can match Apple&#x27;s.<p>The big problem as I see it is it&#x27;s a situation which naturally leads to desperation for a quick solution. But desperation and rushing are actually what Microsoft needs to avoid. And I&#x27;m not convinced in the slightest that Microsoft has recognised or addressed these issues, because they seem to be moving so fast and hoping for such rapid responses with their current efforts. Unfortunately the costs for trying too hard/too fast are pretty high - you taint the brand image indefinitely, as it&#x27;s pretty hard to change that initial impression - certainly hard to even try without seeming like a company that has no self-identity but . With the amount of resources and innovation they&#x27;re putting into their current efforts, it&#x27;d be a shame to see them blow it. I think they would have done better taking their time and letting momentum build slower.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of the story of how the Lotus guys (the car company) managed to convince the James Bond franchise managers to place a Lotus in a Bond film. At the time the Bond guys were being bombarded with requests from car companies, because being featured in their films was so lucrative. The Lotus guys went the other way - they took the car they wanted to push, stripped off all the signage which indicated it was a Lotus, and left it outside of the Bond franchise HQ. As they hoped, the Bond guys came out, saw the car, thought it looked amazing, but because they couldn&#x27;t work out what car it was, they became obsessed with it and determined to find out. Lotus used quietness and confidence to rise above the fray of car manufacturers all trying to out-shout each other.<p>The true proof of confidence is relaxation. Without it, a company is always on the defensive.",1380435998

We do this by incorporating spiral reviews at periodic intervals. Our spiral reviews are &#x27;spaced&#x27; both in time and in content, i.e., students are assessed on multiple topics in the same test.

No one is saying &quot;boy those greeks sure screwed themselves.&quot; And even if one were, that&#x27;s an assessment of their political and economic dealings, though we all know Greece is embedded in a complex arrangement with the EU and the US&#x27;s pig-headed foreign policies.<p>&quot;X&#x27;s ecomomy is crumbling&quot; can be said without racism. And &quot;madness&quot; can be similarly used I hold this true of any peoples subject to the human condition with an economy so described. Look at Morocco, etc. Sometimes environment is the cause, and when the environment is arbitrarily caused.<p>Again, as the commenter noted, nothing was said about Greeks [in general]. Economy of country and that as an alternative explanation to an individual of that country, yes. The articles on the story state that he is Greek so I figured I should as well.<p>In fact by saying &quot;look at the economy&quot; I am even further emphasizing the arbitrariness of a cultural explanation, which psychologizing does not do but rather lends to something about Greekness or Greek social thought. I&#x27;m saying &quot;yes, he happens to be Greek, and he is from a failing economy that may have caused his distress.&quot; And so, &quot;How did this happen to the economy in question that might cause people subject to it to respond in all of these ways?&quot;<p>Again, I don&#x27;t know about the verdict on the man. I withhold opinion. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;ll be able to enjoy life given a majority of the options allotted him. He&#x27;s deprived of life either way, and this too is saddening. So there&#x27;s nothing to say about his &quot;manipulating the system in his favor.&quot; He is in a bad spot regardless, but I think saying that he is deranged is an intuitive response, rather than a critical one. How did he become deranged? He clearly was at some point not deranged. I&#x27;m saying the state of Greece&#x27;s economy, embedded in a global economy, is where we should look.",1380434680

(I dont need to parse SQL, No need to validate if it is correct or not, no need to dynamically find which table to load etc). Don&#x27;t you think it will be even 1% of faster than SQL? (ofcourse I wont go that way for 1%)",1380434479

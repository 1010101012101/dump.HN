7956020,comment,7955671,7955671,3,0,filearts,,,"The author builds arguments based on a couple of premises with which I disagree:<p>1. Live music and recorded music are just two representations of the same underlying piece of art.<p>I would argue that each rendition of a song is its own piece of artwork. A recording is tweaked until it represents the artist&#x27;s (or producer&#x27;s) vision of what the piece should sound like. A live show is spontaneous and unique by definition.<p>2. The measure of art is defined by the intrinsic quality of the piece.<p>I think that art is more than the piece itself and includes the context in which it was created and the way it is presented.<p>In the case of this album, I think that the business model, the current piracy context and even the gilded box contribute to a very interesting piece of artwork. Whether or not the album &#x27;sounds good&#x27; is only one piece of the genius of this work.<p>To say that the Wu-Tang Clan is missing the issue with respect to music&#x27;s exclusivity is totally beside the point. This is something entirely new, with a powerful statement in a very interesting context. For all we know, the entire album could be a bunch of farm animals and gun shots[1][2] and this would still be a great piece of artwork.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.metafilter.com/73403/Something-Awful-Forum-Hilariously-Hijacks-CBC-Anthem-Contest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metafilter.com/73403/Something-Awful-Forum-Hilari...</a><p>2: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbZMnF1VNlE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbZMnF1VNlE</a>",1403899193

That&#x27;s great, because it is $500 to $2k in revenue more than the vast majority of people will ever achieve.  You need to work the numbers on whether the founding team can solo-close $100k in revenue in the next twelve months.<p>If that appears achievable, you tighten your belts, perhaps run up larger balances on your credit cards than usual, and start solo-closing every business you can find locally.  You&#x27;ll spend approximately 95% of your effort in the short term on ad sales and 5% on everything else.  After you can consistently keep the lights on, you&#x27;re going to hire a bunch of folks who will do that job to your script on the telephone all day, every day.  They will be the heart of your business.  They will always be the heart of your business, for values of &quot;always&quot; which map to &quot;as long as you primarily keep the lights on by convincing local businesses to buy advertising.&quot;<p>There is a reasonably achievable path to you having a business here which closely resembles a well-run local newspaper (except you&#x27;ll potentially have nationwide reach): millions of revenue, ~20% margins, etc.  Much like local newspapers, it may be a not-quite-straightforward proposition to confidently say &quot;The people who pay us get great value for their advertising spend.&quot;<p>If your team cannot reasonably solo-close $100k in revenue by repeating your current model, which I allocate a very non-trivial percentage of the probability space to, you do not <i>actually</i> have a revenue model yet.  I&#x27;d have a hard look at my bank account and say &quot;Can we figure out a revenue model before I get thrown out of my apartment for non-payment of rent?&quot;  If not, you may consider winding down the business.  There is <i>no shame in this</i> and, while you may think your current level of success is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, if you hypothetically believe that I would take the other side of that bet.<p>2)  You have a very compelling pitch for getting into YC, 500 Startups, or another incubator.  You have actually shipped a software product.  You won&#x27;t believe me when I tell you, but many, many people who you might think are better fits for incubators cannot actually ship a software product.  You have also successfully demonstrated hustle, by being able to walk into a furniture store and ask them for money, which is something which is lamentably rare among people who are capable of actually shipping software products.  The combination of shipping and hustle is pretty much exactly what incubators look for.<p>This is a straightforward pathway into Door #3, in case executing on Door #3 doesn&#x27;t sound straightforward to you.<p>3)  You have all the elements necessary for raising a small seed round.  You make an AngelList profile and curate it diligently.  You approach a few investors privately, show them your stats and paint a rosy picture of the future (&quot;We&#x27;ve potentially got Groupon&#x27;s growth trajectory ahead of us! [+]&quot;), and secure, say, three to four commitments of $25k each.  You start to trend on AngelList and fill out the rest of the round, probably for $250 to $500k.  (I&#x27;m unaware of what the Going Rate is for valuations at the moment -- probably mid single digit millions but ask someone who does this professionally to fill you in there.)  You bump yourself up to greater-than-subsistence salaries, hire three or four people who are young and hungry, and aim to sustain those growth rates for the next 8 to 12 months.  If you do, you will sail easily to Series A, on your way to creating an rather large business which may or may not resemble the one you are presently running.  If you don&#x27;t, your company implodes.<p>[+] &quot;Patrick, is that a good thing?&quot;  None of the seed stage investors in Groupon are cursing their name right now.

Woodlice first appear in the fossil record 50 million years ago, and remain unchanged to this day, i.e STASIS, not evolution (as in every other case in the fossil record). If you have a picture of a woodlouse changing into anything else then please post it here. Or did you mean a trilobite by any chance? If so, I would expect a PhD geology student to know the difference between a woodlouse and a trilobite (and trilobites didn&#x27;t evolve into anything else either - they just became extinct).<p>The cosmic microwave background (CMB) actually poses problems for Big Bang. Obviously you are unfamiliar with the most recent findings from 2001, so I suggest you start learning about it here:<p><a href=""http://creation.com/recent-cosmic-microwave-background-data-supports-creationist-cosmologies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://creation.com/recent-cosmic-microwave-background-data-...</a>.<p>Furthermore, the CMB merely PRESUPPOSES a big bang in the first place (and big bang is by no means certain - as many astrophysicists will tell you), so there are many assumptions involved in drawing inferences from it. The CMB is also very smooth - contrary to big bang predictions - and the observed mass density does not agree with big bang predictions either. There is no evidence, observational or otherwise, to prove that a big bang actually occurred (which is why many scientist disbelieve in it) nor is there any definitive evidence that the universe is billions of years old (I think that old chestnut arose from uniformitarian geologists&#x27; misguided counting of strata, mistakenly believing each layer to have been laid down over &#x27;millions of years&#x27;, even though recent laboratory experiments as well as direct field observation, have proved it can happen in hours or days).<p>Like any typical atheist (even though you describe yourself here as a Secular Humanist)you refer to &quot;Christian violence that occurred in Europe centuries ago&quot;, forgetting of course that the most appalling violence, including mass genocide, took place in modern history at the hands of exclusively atheistic regimes, all of whose despotic leaders followed Darwinian theories completely (e.g. Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Mau Tse Tung, etc).<p>As it happens, I am from the UK too (and I&#x27;m an astrophysics major). You are free to refute the &quot;supposed existence&quot; of God in your own home, but please do not try to impose your own secular values on me, or on other people of faith in the UK, and especially not on my child&#x27;s chance of benefiting from a decent indoctrination-free education.

Delegate.  Think through just what your role currently is, and what you would like it to be.  Think about what parts of what you do could be done by others, and who in your company could do them instead of you. Then sit down with your people and work out a plan to make that happen.<p>It won&#x27;t be easy. It&#x27;s hard to give up control like that. It&#x27;s hard to deal with the fact that someone else might not do what you did they way you did it. But what&#x27;s important is that it gets done, and the way they do it may be better than the way you did it. You have to be able to give your people space to do things in their own way, and your only real concern is whether they do it effectively.<p>As companies grow and add people, roles change.  What people do and how they do it changes.  As the founder of a startup, your early days are very hands on, and you probably do some of just about everything that needs to be done on a day to day basis.  As the company grows, you <i>can&#x27;t</i> do that.  There aren&#x27;t enough hours in a day.

The problem is that most clients don&#x27;t support it (and there are currently some nontrivial reasons for that).<p>What would be great is if somebody (I&#x27;m looking at you, Google or Mozilla) with the clout to get their CA cert trusted could set up a free website that would validate DNS TLSA records with DNSSEC (or DNSCurve if you like) and then automatically sign the certificate from the DNS record with the CA key. That should be <i>at least</i> as secure as domain validation with email, and a lot easier to do. Then you could put that cert on your server and use it for all the clients that don&#x27;t support DNSSEC, and relegate DNSSEC and all its problems to just providing strong proof to the CA that it&#x27;s signing the right certificate.<p>Combine that with certificate pinning and it should pretty well solve the problem, and leave CAs to the job they should have had all along, which is providing extended validation certificates for banks and the like.",1403898639

That assumes a 1% fee on all trades, which is already unsustainable in the current exchange market. It also assumes 0 operating expenses, but hey we&#x27;re being generous in this calculation.<p>To do 85,000,000 in BTC on MtGox would mean averaging over 230,000 BTC of daily trading volume for 365 days. For context, most Bitcoin exchanges these days are doing 20% of that on a record day. So if we&#x27;re super duper generous in our calculations, we&#x27;d assume it would take Karpeles 5 years to accumulate the amount he stole in a legal way. This further assumes two equally incredibly unlikely things:<p>1. MtGox stays ahead of the competition<p>2. MtGox maintains a 1% trading fee<p>Remember that in April of 2013, which is when MtGox had its second huge trading engine crash, there was already significant demand amongst traders to move away from MtGox, which is precisely how MtGox started rapidly losing marketshare.<p>The TLDR is, Karpeles wouldn&#x27;t have made nearly as much money by engaging in legal business. He would&#x27;ve found it much more tempting to close MtGox before having to deal with burdensome regulations coming out of America, a trend which started in 2013. And even if he had tried to deal with regulators, MtGox most likely wouldn&#x27;t have been able to maintain its number 1 position for much longer.<p>So the fact of the matter is he was looking at spending the next 10-20 years pursuing a business he wasn&#x27;t prepared to run, or he could&#x27;ve just taken the money and walked away, declaring bankruptcy.<p>> Simplest explanation is best: Karpeles was incompetent and distracted, didn&#x27;t trust others, wrote horrible code nowhere near suitable for a bitcoin exchange and when he noticed a year later that he had been robbed attempted to cover it up.<p>I find it absolutely, positively _unbelievable_ that 850,000 BTC were stolen out of a hot wallet. If it had been due to terrible coding practices, he would&#x27;ve gone to that as his first alibi rather than claiming 850,000 BTC were lost due to&quot;transaction malleability&quot;.

7955855,comment,7954778,7955755,4,0,munificent,,,"This is a very simplified answer, but here&#x27;s my take:<p>CoffeeScript says that the main problems with JS are the inelegant C-style syntax and a few semantic trip wires. It addresses those while still keeping the underlying semantics, APIs and ecosystem.<p>If what drives you up the wall about JS is stuff like the DOM, or JS&#x27;s object model, CoffeeScript won&#x27;t help you much. If you are OK with how JS behaves and like the very large JS ecosystem, CoffeeScript can be a nice fit.<p>Dart takes a much larger semantic step away from JS. Syntactically, it&#x27;s more similar to JS than CoffeeScript is. It sticks with braces and statements, and the whole C kit and kaboodle.<p>However, semantically, it&#x27;s much different. It has a full-featured class system with inheritance, mixins, getters, setters, operator overloading, etc. It has a static type system so you get the nice tooling experience you expect from a language like Java or C#. It also completely revamps the DOM APIs to (hopefully) be more rational, modern and consistent.<p>The cost, though, is that interacting with the existing JavaScript world is a little more difficult. You can interop, of course, but it isn&#x27;t as seamless as CoffeeScript.",1403897354
7955854,comment,7954266,7955534,25,0,bane,,,"It&#x27;s also possible to lift oneself out of low circumstances, but man-oh-man is it hard.<p>My father ran away from his home in the late 40s/early 50s as a teenager to escape crushing poverty in the midwest (where shoes were literally an item to be shared amongst his siblings and starting a full-time job at 13 was normal). He joined the army, fought in Korea, came home and became the first person ever on my father&#x27;s side to earn a college degree with copious help from the G.I. Bill.<p>It meant he could move up to low-paid white collar jobs instead of blue collar labor jobs, but still he didn&#x27;t become a &quot;success.&quot; He taught school for a while, until the rampant crime of the poor parts of Chicago scared him away, and after that he bounced around in various jobs: owning a gas station, sales, traveling sales, etc. He finally settled in the business I grew up in. But it was not wildly profitable.<p>My mother grew up in a family of non-college educated sales people and housewives. She attended 1 semester of community college before dropping out, married my father not long after and only ever really worked in the family business. To my knowledge, only 2 people on her side ever graduated from college: 2 of her brothers, both became reasonably successful.<p>My parents paid the employees first before they got paid, so we often went months without money. I think during the best year ever, a year with near monthly lucky breaks, my parents combined income <i>may</i> have broken $90k. During our worst year, we spent 4 months homeless, living in a roadside motel full of drug addicts and other questionable types. When we had a home<p>College and school was not a priority for me, I never took the SATs, and I guess it was assumed I would just inherit the family business. There&#x27;s a long(er) story in between, but I&#x27;m the first person in my family to earn a Masters Degree and feel like I&#x27;m reasonably successful, upper-middle middle-class. I didn&#x27;t do it all on my own, I was given some great opportunities and help along the way and seized those moments like my life depended on it and worked my tail off.<p>A great many of my peers fell into two camps, those born into wealth pretty much all turned out great, great educations, great careers. I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m about middle of the pack with these folks. A few slid down a bit, usually various substance abuse issues were involved. But even then, many of <i>those</i> folks had the family resources at hand to turn their lives around when they had solved the substance problems.<p>Those born into similar economic situations that I grew up in tended to stay in those situations. If they grew up in a single parent family and their mother worked part-time at the local Circle-K, there&#x27;s a big chance that that&#x27;s where they ended up as well or fell down even further. Thinking back, I can only think of 1 or 2 other kids I grew up with who worked their way out of the socio-economic conditions we grew up in. By and large, most of them didn&#x27;t find a way out.<p>What&#x27;s disturbed me are the people who were also given great opportunities but squandered them. The ones who somehow were sponsored to attend college for free, but failed out because of too much World of Warcraft, or couldn&#x27;t figure out how to operate a condom and ended up with 3 kids they couldn&#x27;t care for. Pondering these folks, I suspect that the &quot;Marshmallow Effect&quot; is a real problem for them. Most of the life choices where they lost an opportunity to get ahead involved them taking a strategic and difficult, long, view of their life...with the option of doing something that felt good at the moment instead. They usually took the feel good option instead.<p>Case-in-point, my best friend of more than 20 years has had opportunity upon opportunity come his way and blow them and has been more or less perpetually bankrupt since we got out of High School. He recently ran into yet another serious money and family problem prompting us to have a serious grownup conversation about his life-choices to date. He wasn&#x27;t even aware that he had had these opportunities I spoke of and our parting words were that he was going to make a concerted effort to get a better job and work on solving his money situation instead of leeching off of everybody around him.<p>It&#x27;s 3 months later, he hasn&#x27;t finished his resume, has &quot;applied&quot; for 3 jobs in that time, and moved to a more expensive apartment he can&#x27;t possibly pay for given his current situation. Why did he move? &quot;My lease was up and I wanted a better location, near a better school district for my son.&quot; His son who won&#x27;t start school for 3 more years. With so much left to do, you&#x27;d expect that he be spending his nights and weekends working a second job, or some other meaningful activity. No, Steam shows he spends most of his time after work screwing around.<p>This is all anecdotes of course, but I suspect that it&#x27;s applicable in a great many places as well. Help and opportunities are out there if you&#x27;re poor. But you have to work 2 or 3 times as hard as the other person who grew up rich and wealthy. While my school-mates were being given a generous monthly allowance, their parents credit cards, new computers and condos closer to school with a brand new SUV to drive the quarter mile there and back, I was working a full-time job, taking night school, driving an hour and a half to school and back in a car I was praying wouldn&#x27;t die on me, sleeping 4 hours a night, and literally eating instant noodles 3 times a day for months on end. But I&#x27;m thankful every single day that I had: a car to drive, a job to drive to, school grants to cover my education, teachers who understood my situation and let me turn things in a day late, a boss who understood as well and let me take time off for exams and studying and more. I treated each of those opportunities as precious and tried to make 130% of them. And as time went on, doing so turned each of those initial opportunities into more opportunities, a snowball effect.",1403897350

We have a co-working membership at the Underground @ Main in Durham, and mostly work out of there, Beyu Cafe, Barnes & Noble, Panera Bread, and/or our respective homes.<p>Our own door?  Feh, if the bar were set that high, we wouldn&#x27;t even exist and be doing this, since there&#x27;s no money to rent office space right now.

If we wind up raising money at some point, and/or get some serious customer revenue coming in, then yeah, sure, we&#x27;d start looking at office space.  But right now the UG@Main works great for us.  There&#x27;s a nice place to work with fast &#x27;net access, convenient access to the rest of downtown, AND we can reserve a conference room if we need it for a customer meeting, investor meeting, partner meeting, etc.  TBH, that&#x27;s the main reason we even have co-working here, so we&#x27;ll have a place to meet people that&#x27;s better than saying &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s meet at Starbucks&quot;.<p>My feeling:  Get an office when you&#x27;re ready for it, not sooner. :-)<p>Edit: to expand on this...

7955798,comment,7954778,7955535,2,0,munificent,,,"> One big issue with JavaScript applications is that they are single threaded. Does Dart/Web Component platform provide any solution to this?<p>Because Dart compiles to JavaScript, we&#x27;re limited in some ways in what we can do here. We do, of course, support Web Workers, but those have a bunch of constraints that make them difficult to use in practice.<p>We have tried to make single-threaded async programming more pleasant. In particular, Dart comes with built-in, very rich Future and Stream types. Even better, those are deeply integrated into the code libraries, including the DOM.<p>Every asynchronous DOM operation in Dart returns a future, which is much more pleasant to deal with than raw callbacks. Likewise, things like events are exposed as streams, so you can map and transform them like any other stream of data.<p>I gave a talk on Dart at Strange Loop last year[1] that talks a bit about this. Skip to around 38 minutes.<p>> 2. Will we see another UI rendering layer other than DOM for Dart?<p>Good question! There are a few different frameworks that people have built for Dart that expose their own ways of expressing UI. I think they all ultimately fall back to the DOM because that&#x27;s the primitive the browser gives you, but what you as a programmer deal with may be fairly removed from that.<p>These days, I mostly do command-line Dart stuff, so I don&#x27;t have a good lay of the land here.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/dart-introduction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/dart-introduction</a>",1403896723

The application is absolutely rock solid for me - most of the database crashes, and corruptions have stopped occurring for over a year - so in the interim, I have a product that works for me and will keep me satisfied for the next couple years.<p>Meanwhile, Apple is going to put all their energy into a single photo system, instead of trying to do some schizophrenic split between iPhoto/Aperture - I expect to see a pretty excellent system out of it.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t work commercial or event photography, but the reality is that most of what I use Aperture for these days could probably be done with a slightly beefier iPhoto - which is pretty much what Photos is going to become.<p>Photostream, as of about 3-4 months ago, has also gotten reliable enough that I <i>never</i> have to worry about any picture that I&#x27;ve taken being on my Laptop.  Unlike the early days (months, year?) when it was pretty much a crapshoot as to whether your pictures would move from your iPhone to PhotoStream and then to your laptop - It Just Works now.<p>So, good news all around.",1403896338

It&#x27;s true that the library is frighteningly monolithic and the learning curve quite steep, but personally, I very much appreciate the declarative syntax, the very complete documentation, the multiple examples, the flexible MVC structure and the fact that it can easily result in nice decoupled code, as you can plug any backend you like, as long as it communicates through a well-defined protocol (I personally favor Python and Flask).",1403896199

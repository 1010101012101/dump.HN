The problem is that the net effect of all those independent &quot;preferences&quot;, which we know are shaped by society, hurts actual people.<p>We can&#x27;t just say &quot;be attracted to different people&quot;, because people like what they like, but it is certainly valuable to know how our preferences are likely to be biased.

He gets a lot of love for being a Buddhist (which is, of the world religions, the one I am closest to) and having, for a businessman, a 99th-percentile design sense. In actuality, he was a huge dickhead. I could overlook his personal issues (you&#x27;ll never get to the bottom of a stranger&#x27;s personal life, to try is useless gossip) but the collusion with Eric Schmidt cemented my contempt for the man, co-religionist or no. I wish he had lived two years more to see that his legacy would be a great crime, not the iPhone.<p>When you&#x27;re 13, tech is <i>fun</i>. Dragon Warrior! Final Fantasy! Tales of Phantasia! I&#x27;m sure that anyone born before 1965 or after 1990 is going to be taking me on faith, but these games were <i>awesome</i>.<p>When you&#x27;re 19, tech is <i>even more fun</i> because you actually learn how things work and discover mind-bending ways of solving problems. Assembly code! C! Lisps! Machine learning! Haskell!<p>When you&#x27;re 25, tech is <i>important</i> because it holds the power to solve some of humanity&#x27;s most pressing issues. We may get to a point where we can prolong life as long as people wish at 1/100 the cost of the current expense-sink we call &quot;health care&quot;. We may avert a global warming catastrophe with clean nuclear power (thorium fission? fusion?) We might escape this disgusting arrangement in which one nation being rich requires others to be poor, and arrive at a post-scarcity world in the next few decades. If any of this happens, technology will play a key role.<p>After 30, you realize that while technology still can be fun and holds promise and importance, <i>the tech industry</i> is run by megalomaniac 21st-century robber barons with the ethical fibre of Zombie Hitler&#x27;s taint sweat. Technology becomes just <i>work</i>, for most people.<p>When they see their kids addicted to lit screens and possibly falling into the in-app purchase suckholes that they spent months of their life optimizing for addictiveness and &quot;whale&quot; recruiting, well... they have reasons to be concerned. <i>Stay away from that shit!

I&#x27;m calling the overall trend of people picking some new technology/activity and portraying it as the end-all sensationalist bullshit. I&#x27;m not trying to protect video games, I&#x27;ve long since stopped playing them. I&#x27;m just trying to approach this from a more realistic angle.<p>If you want to be in denial and not recognize a friend&#x27;s addiction and mental health issues, that is understandable but a bad path to choose. I&#x27;ve seen addiction time and time again. I don&#x27;t know your friend, it&#x27;s possible he was addicted to video games and just drank a Heineken here and there and that the alcohol was purely incidental to his demise. However, I&#x27;ve seen this type of thing happen on several occasions. Someone has an addiction, be it alcohol, cocaine, or heroin. They lock themselves away from everyone and indulge in their habit. As a side-effect of that, they wind up doing something fairly low-energy like watching TV, surfing the internet, or playing video games. Ultimately, their organs start to fail and they wind up dead or near-death in the ER.<p>I&#x27;ve been to the funerals, I&#x27;ve seen the jaundiced, malnourished bodies, I&#x27;ve had to help clean up the aftermath, both emotional and physical. I&#x27;m sure your friend was a good guy who couldn&#x27;t shake his problems, and I don&#x27;t mean to make light of anything. I&#x27;ve seen too many otherwise good people die of substance abuse, and I know several members of my family will likely still die in a similar manner. Saying someone died &quot;as a result of playing video games&quot; is a cop-out for not wanting to admit someone had an addiction to other substances, whatever the reason may be. Your liver doesn&#x27;t fail because you played too much Halo. It&#x27;s sad, but it&#x27;s the truth.",1410439857

Apparently not.<p>It&#x27;s never going to be over, as long as young children have access to technology.<p>HN seems to preach a perverse gospel about this subject: that you should never limit a child&#x27;s technology access, because not only will nothing bad come out of, but in fact, it will make them more capable. It will turn them into developers and engineers!<p>I&#x27;m guessing the reason HN thinks this way is because they themselves got into technology in the first place through such avenues: dicking around as a kid, sometimes with the help of their parents, sometimes contrary to their wishes. If THEY had been restricted, they wouldn&#x27;t be where they are today.<p>But this reason suffers from selection bias. While people like yourself (unless I&#x27;m misreading you. In which case, substitute the stereotypical HN user for yourself) may have used videogames and computer access as a spring board for your career, I&#x27;m willing to wager that you are minority among videogame and computer-saavy youth.*  You are a bigger majority, however, on HN, and in the tech world in general, so such reasoning becomes canon without being subject to enough criticism. Plenty of technologists were gamers, but not all gamers become technologists. It&#x27;s just that the former dominate here.<p>*I don&#x27;t have any statistics on hand to support this. But since the videogame industry is as big (and growing) as it is, where are the rising mountains of developers and engineers that supposedly spring from it? Why aren&#x27;t girls, who spend comparable time with technology, catching the wave as well?<p>My little brother has been addicted to Minecraft for the past 2 years. I keep waiting for him to &quot;discover&quot; something else as a result of it. To get into programming, or design, or architecture, or something more constructive. Hell, even building things in Minecraft would be more productive than what he does now: go on PvP servers and throw snowballs at people--for 12 hours a day, if my parents let him. He&#x27;s tried programming lessons a few times, but he usually gives up, because learning a new skill is harder than playing (even difficult) games. He lacks the trait of perseverance.

How do companies create products people use every day? What are the secrets of building services customers love? How can designers create products compelling enough to &quot;hook&quot; users?<p>Nir Eyal, the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, has constructed a practical framework for designing better products. The framework gives product managers, designers, and marketers a new way for thinking of the necessary components of changing user behavior. Nir will share the tactics companies like Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Whatsapp, and Twitter use to drive engagement.<p>Habit design is a super power. If used for good, habit design can enhance people’s lives with entertaining and even healthful routines. If used for evil, habits can quickly turn into wasteful addictions.\nCompanies need to know how to harness the power of hooks to improve peoples’ lives. This workshop will provide attendees with a powerful toolkit and framework for creating better products and likely change the way attendees see the world.<p>Participants will learn:<p>- The common design patterns of habit-forming products.<p>- The stages of habit formation and how to optimize for user retention.<p>- An in-depth look at the psychology behind what drives user behavior and how to build products to cater to core human needs.<p>- Practical steps for leading a habit design process to ensure your product is used regularly.<p>Who should attend:<p>This seminar is for anyone seeking to understand habit-forming product design. The workshop is tailored to product managers, entrepreneurs, or designers working in companies large or small.

I feel like my brain gets extremely excited and so I stop thinking about basic things like eating, drinking or going to the toilet. It&#x27;s like by playing I am overwriting this basic functionality of my brain. When this happens and I don&#x27;t control myself, I can play for hours and hours, usually all night long (which is something I would never do in any other situation, I love resting in a bed). It&#x27;s happened before being able to continuously play for almost 24h without that basic functionality I talked about. There&#x27;s always a time when I actually get in control again and decide to stop, usually by uninstalling the game right away to avoid doing it again anytime soon. I then get a really big headache/hangover. As such, I avoid doing it but it still happens once every one or two years, it depends on Sid Meier&#x27;s productivity, if you know what I mean. (Yeah, this November is going to be hard on me.)<p>I&#x27;m ok with games with a small duration, casual games with a completion time of up to 5/10 minutes.

I&#x27;m `saying what I mean` when I apply constraints - that can be done in code too, of course, although Xcode 6 is getting pretty good at surfacing that information. Whereas when I&#x27;m dealing with a box model I&#x27;m having to play compiler in my head. LinearLayout, RelativeLayout - these are terms that are optimised for the computer to understand. Constraints are the way we humans think about things. &quot;Element A should always be 10 points to the left of Element B&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like imperative vs. functional programming. In the former model, I have an idea in my head and I need to nest containers step by step to get to the final form. In the latter I&#x27;m simply building up a ruleset.<p>But like I said, that was my personal preference. I guess we&#x27;ll have to differ on opinions ;)",1410437407

My girlfriends father died this past Spring because he holed himself up in his apartment, drinking himself to death and also died of liver failure. He would just drink and watch TV all day. In your case, I would call the video games incidental to the alcohol addiction just like I would call the TV binging incidental to my girlfriend&#x27;s father&#x27;s addiction. I&#x27;m sure there is a larger mental-health component to it all, but in the end, video games were probably not to blame here. And sorry to hear about your friend.<p>Surely you can get addicted to video games, though I have a nagging feeling that rate of addiction is lower than any of your classical addictions like alcohol or narcotics. Of course I also recall reading an article about some poor kid in Korea dying after constantly playing video games and not sleeping or the case of the parents who neglected their own infant who later died due to their supposed addiction to video games. So then you have nicely packaged stories of &quot;that one kid&quot; or &quot;those parents&quot; in your head to pull up at a moments notice and the wonderful forces of logical fallacies cause some folks to think it&#x27;s an epidemic of never-before-seen proportions.<p>The point is that more &quot;video game addiction&quot; is just sensationalist bullshit. My mother surely thought I was addicted to video games in my teenage years. Of course I spent maybe an hour or two playing video games and the rest programming. In fact, even after I got a job as a software engineer right out of highschool and a full-ride scholarship, she was still convinced I was addicted to &quot;those damn games&quot; and I&#x27;m sure half of the folks here will one day be thinking kids are addicted to their Google Glasses or whatever technology we wind up with. It&#x27;s no different than parents of yore thinking Rock n&#x27; Roll was corrupting their children. Parents, as a whole, can be some really sensationalist dumbasses.",1410437279

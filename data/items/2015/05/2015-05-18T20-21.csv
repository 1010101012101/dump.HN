You might get a junior with little experience for %30.<p>That may not be fair-- but that&#x27;s what your ad telegraphs.

Still, if I wanted to go full-hog static-typed functional I doubt I&#x27;d be using straight Javascript, I&#x27;d probably try one of the various Haskell-alike to JS converters.  Promises with async/await syntax seems like the most practical of the various solutions whilst still feeling like Javascript.<p>(Besides, I prefer dynamic typing and I find points-free style in Haskell to be obfuscating rather than clarifying, so it seems unlikely we&#x27;re going to have the same opinion of the best way to accomplish things here.  :)",1431982734

To get the js-css-trickster-folks on board the first version works &#x27;obviously&#x27; by splitting an image into the shadow and non-shadow parts <i>offline</i>.

Some micro-benchmarking should be able to show that the two shadows (jpg compressed &#x27;obviously&#x27;) plus css and js put together are smaller than a simple jpg compressed version of the input image...

9566820,comment,9564878,9566334,0,0,runako,,,"I think you may be missing the point. I don&#x27;t think the boom in equities escaped Krugman or other observers. I think the point is more that boom or no, boards get to approve comp packages. And when designing a comp package, it is not all that difficult to ensure that the CEO does/does not qualify for gargantuan sums of money on meeting performance targets. Further, taking this step can lead to better alignment with shareholders.<p>For example, one frequently recommended way to improve compensation is to compensate on alpha vs. a peer group and/or index. Clearly, every CEO in the S&P 500 didn&#x27;t deserve the massive ramp in comp implied by the charts.<p>Bigger picture, just like with any employee, management usually has an idea of the total package value in mind and then backs into how the employee gets there. If the Board starts with an expectation that the CEO should make a gazillion dollars, they can design a package to get there. If the expectation is that the CEO should earn less, they can design a package to do that as well. The question remains why this expectation changed.",1431982526

It is a little disappointing to go back to using bash, but as long as bash-completion is working, it&#x27;s not really a big issue. Of course, I do miss the syntax highlighting. (I would use zsh, but it provides little benefit over bash out of the box and is slower (oh-my-zsh is unbearably slow to start, too).)<p>There are a few things that, while I understand why fish is missing them, I wish would be added:<p>- vi-mode, obviously<p>- Control+R. It is annoying to have to guess how much you must type before hitting the up arrow, instead of having it dynamically displayed. Same goes for zsh vi-mode&#x27;s ? command.<p>- Well more of a removal, but the backslash in single-quoted strings. I&#x27;m used to typing &#x27;\&#x27;, and that&#x27;s not possible with fish. Additionally, to get one backslash in any sort of regex (sed, grep), you need four backslashes.<p>- Goes without saying, but bash-completion. Fish&#x27;s completion is mostly history-based, which is great for repeatedly running the same command, but terrible for discoverability<p>- &quot;$()&quot; and any non-splitting command substitution. Currently, it is impossible to pass a multi-line string from a command substitution as a single argument. Which, it may be argued, should be done by piping, but sometimes it is useful to have stdin.<p>- More extensibility in general. I&#x27;d like to be able to customize my shell just as much as I can customize my WM. Probably more.<p>Honestly, it was easier to go back to using bash than I thought it would be -- it was almost a relief. fish just feels more polished and clean, especially with regard to escaping, but it misses some very important features.<p>Edit: I heard that there is a vi-mode now. Sounds interesting, but I don&#x27;t really feel like installing it at the moment, and if I ever try another shell it&#x27;ll probably be zsh.",1431981207

9566686,comment,9564975,9564975,0,0,kentonv,,,"Another weirdness about signalfd: read() from a signalfd returns signals for the calling process, regardless of what process created the signalfd (e.g. it could have been inherited through fork()). That&#x27;s arguably usually what you want, but is inconsistent with usual file descriptor semantics, which say that it doesn&#x27;t matter who read()s.<p>One place where the inconsistency gets weird is when you use signalfd with epoll. The epoll will flag events on the signalfd based on the process where the signalfd was registered with epoll, not the process where the epoll is being used. One case where this can be surprising is if you set up a signalfd and an epoll and then fork() for the purpose of daemonizing -- now you will find that your epoll mysteriously doesn&#x27;t deliver any events for the signalfd despite the signalfd otherwise appearing to function as expected. That took me a day or two to debug. :(<p>With all that said, at the end of the day I disagree with Geoff. I would rather use signalfd than signal handlers. The &quot;self-pipe trick&quot; is ugly, involves a lot of unnecessary overhead, and runs the risk of deadlocking if you receive enough signals to fill the pipe buffer before you read them back (which can be solved with additional synchronization, but ick). In fact, in my own code, on systems that don&#x27;t have signalfd or any similar mechanism, I tend to block signals except when I&#x27;m about to call poll(), and then siglongjmp() out of the signal handler to avoid the usual race condition. (See pselect(2) for discussion of said race condition.)<p>I think it&#x27;s just a fact of life that you need to clear your signal mask between fork() and exec(), and yeah no one does this, whoops.<p>BTW, for the specific problem of dealing with child processes, I really hope Linux adopts the Capsicum interface as FreeBSD has:<p><a href=""https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pdfork&sektion=2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pdfork&sektion=2</a><p>Until then, you simply can&#x27;t expect to reap children via signals.

9566674,comment,9564010,9565496,0,0,ht_th,,,"That&#x27;s an interesting question, now you&#x27;ve made me think about it. Let me write the same program in ALGOL 60 first, which would have been considered an imperative language and was relatively &quot;close to the metal&quot; to our standards:<p><pre><code>    integer procedure Fib (n); integer n;
    begin
        if n = 0 then
             Fib := 0
        else if n = 1 then
             Fib := 1
        else Fib := Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2);
    end Fib
        </code></pre>
Besides the obvious differences in syntax, I&#x27;d say that the procedure/method/function/subroutine is the same. Still, a more fundamental difference is the &quot;distance&quot; from the machine. In ALGOL 60 we almost see through it the implementation in machine code / assembler (or whatever mix between the two were actually used in those days) where a call to a subroutine meant mutating state: the calls, their arguments, and the results had to kept track of on the stack. For ALGOL 60 programmers of the time, their operational understanding of this snippet and ALGOL was imperative.<p>Compare that to Ruby in its modern context. Implementation details have been abstracted away in both language and in programmers&#x27; operational understanding of how the example and Ruby works. If I use and understand a machine that speaks Ruby—a way to look at using a programming language is to imagine a machine that has that programming language as its machine code—, there&#x27;s no mutation, only a variable sequence of calls to fib written succinctly in a recursive manner. How&#x27;s that different from functional programming? To be honest, I don&#x27;t know. Maybe we should start interpreting &quot;imperative&quot; and &quot;functional&quot; differently than our predecessors did. Or, maybe these distinctions are getting less and less meaningful the more abstract a language or computing environment?<p>(As an aside, it is also interesting you use &quot;accumulated&quot;, as for most ALGOL 60 programmers the accumulator in the arithmetic unit of their massive computers would take a prominent place.)",1431980765

The <i>incomplete</i> docs were &quot;thousands&quot; of pages. Does anyone really believe even half the team would read &quot;complete&quot; documentation, that are thousands upon thousands of pages? Would complete docs speed up development time? Would they speed up development time even taking into account the cost of producing and consuming complete docs? Is the size of module truly essential complexity, or is part of the problem that they&#x27;re building on legacy code?<p>The author mentions interop with other teams and third party software as a large source of friction. Why are other modules so large and complex that they&#x27;re maintained by separate teams? Is that essential complexity, or was it caused by previous attempts to patch their way to release? Would the modules be more manageable, and hence, require smaller teams, if they used other practices/languages/tools?<p>Access to test hardware, and managing the test personnel was another source of friction. What is the cost of buying more test hardware? In previous companies where I&#x27;ve worked, with manual QA depts and under-funded test hardware budgets, doubling the hardware budget would allow halving the QA salary budget (primarily because you don&#x27;t need to hot-swap equipment several times a day), and shorten test cycles. Is that the case here?<p>Further, how much manual test is truly necessary, and how much is caused by the developers not writing automated tests?",1431980043

The high degree of correlation is a priori  slightly weird, although it would be interesting to look more deeply into how probable it is that two such time-series would be so strongly correlated.<p>However, the causal account is easily tested: <a href=""http://web.stanford.edu/group/knowledgebase/cgi-bin/2010/09/17/sensitivity-of-ceo-wealth-to-stock-price-a-new-tool-for-assessing-pay-for-performance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.stanford.edu/group/knowledgebase/cgi-bin/2010/09/...</a><p>From the paper: &quot;Based on a sample of 4,000 publicly traded U.S. companies, the average (median) CEO stands to gain roughly $58,000 in wealth for every 1 percent increase in stock price.

9566602,comment,9564010,9564010,0,0,andronik,,,"It&#x27;s a me, the author. 
Let me start.<p>First of all, I would like to address the 6 distinct features I was talking about in the theoretical introduction. Those 6 features/rules are described in the same way in a book called &quot;Introduction to Scheme&quot;. I&#x27;m guessing I haven&#x27;t explained it very well. Basically, what I meant is that those are the rules functional languages should follow in order to be called pure functional languages. I didn&#x27;t say that that is the case with most languages, nor that this is the case with Haskell or Scheme. I know most of them don&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s just a piece of theory. 
And yes, I did mean static binding, I apologize, since linking and binding are denoted by the same word in my language.<p>Next thing, about the algorithms. Fibonacci example was just to show closeness to mathematical notation and I know it&#x27;s probably the worst way to use recursion because of the O(2^n) time complexity. But, again, complexity was not the point of the example. About the notation, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s just me then. I was a lot more comfortable with pure mathematical notation, as I like things to be formal as much as they can, and that&#x27;s something that mathematics provide.<p>The whole point of the post itself was to give a small introduction to functional programming and show off features that may not be available in most imperative languages.<p>Of course, as I&#x27;ve also said in the outro, I&#x27;m not really planning on switching to purely functional languages, I was just trying to say that they can be fun in some situations and for some problem solving. The different way of thinking is what makes it so fun, at least for me.<p>About higher-order functions, I truly was mistaken, as I&#x27;ve thought that was a thing for functional languages only. Guess I don&#x27;t have that much experience in the imperative world, as I&#x27;ve never came across them in my line of work.<p>So please, don&#x27;t take this article as anti-imperative, as it&#x27;s most certainly not.<p>So, tl;dr, I instantly liked functional programming and I wanted to share some features that I liked the most, and haven&#x27;t seen in imperative way.<p>I do apologize for misleading/possibly incorrect parts, and I shall edit those in my earliest convenience.",1431980011

I am a hardware designer who participated heavily in mining since Jan 2011, and gave up completely on Bitcoin in summer of 2014.<p>The big problem that Balaji is completely ignoring is that SHA256 cores implemented in silicon have extraordinarily high power consumption relative to their size (mm2). This is due to the incredibly high signal switch rate inherent to implementing avalanche-style ciphers [1] in hardware. Perversely, most modern semiconductor processes optimize for static (leakage) power, since modern silicon designs are more vulnerable to this than to dynamic power. No rational semiconductor maker will want to include this IP on chip, because it will drastically complicate the power distribution metal layers. Additionally, it will require more expensive packaging, since you will need many more power and ground pins to source/sink the required current. I know this first hand after building a mining ASIC myself. I would venture a guess that most SoC chips would cost significantly more due to the extra engineering time and packaging cost needed to include this IP.<p>This entire concept is a non-starter for me.<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.neustar.biz/2012/02/02/choosing-a-good-hash-function-part-3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.neustar.biz/2012/02/02/choosing-a-good-hash-...</a>",1431979403

9566536,comment,9566091,9566091,0,0,Animats,,,"This makes no sense.  This is what a current Bitcoin mining operation looks like.[1] It looks like a low end data center. Few cables, because the miners only need to communicate when they find a block or are getting new starting points.  Power and cooling costs are a huge issue in Bitcoin mining. Most profitable Bitcoin mines are in cold places. This one is in Sweden. There are bigger ones in China. There&#x27;s no way a small, low-powered Bitcoin miner can make money today. That era ended years ago.<p>The way Bitcoin mining works, you don&#x27;t get anything unless you win an entire block.  That happens about once every 10 minutes over the whole Bitcoin ecosystem.  If they&#x27;re talking about &quot;a constant stream of satoshis&quot;, they mean you&#x27;re a slave of their mining farm, working for them and maybe getting paid some pittance by them.<p>Is this thing a hoax?

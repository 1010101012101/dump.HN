78473,comment,78428,78428,0,0,amalcon,,,"It's actually pretty easy -- you can only change the total value of the board by n at a time (takes care of the ""only if"" part, because the ""all equal"" state also requires the sum mod n to = 0).  You can increase a single cell by n in exchange for increasing all cells (including that one) by 1 (by hitting the column it's in, then the row it's in, then rotating the column, repeat).  You can spread the n part of that ""increase"" out over any number of cells you like, in any (whole) allocation you like, because it's clearly easy to put whatever cells you like in one column.  So that lets you equalize everything as long as you move the deltas in clumps of n, which satisfies the ""if"" part.",1194814122

The described ""nerd"" traits are largely a self-imposed condition, and glorification of them only makes them worse. <p>There are <i>plenty</i> of people out there who are exceptionally good with ""nerdy"" subjects, yet whom also have social lives, enjoy travel and human contact, and find a life spent locked in front of a computer to be extremely limiting.  And those people are often the most respected and honored by their peers.<p>The common thread that I sense in these kinds of articles is  one of <i>defensiveness</i> -- here's why I'm different, and why you should treat me with kid gloves.  And I suppose that's a natural behavior for a group that perceives itself as marginal, but it's not anything particularly insightful or life-enhancing.",1194811948

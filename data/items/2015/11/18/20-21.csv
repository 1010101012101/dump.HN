She also does not so much as hint at societal gender discrimination.

10590678,comment,10587717,10588348,0,0,saurik,,,"I remember quite distinctly when the Python 3000 manifesto was released just under ten years ago, in April of 2006. That is when the line in the sand was drawn and the key mistakes were made that caused the &quot;schism&quot; in the community. What the Python community was screaming for was a fix for the GIL and the other performance issues in Python, not minor changes to Unicode handling that were maybe awkward but perfectly possible to get right in Python 2.6.<p>Google seriously spent tons of effort at the time trying to remove that GIL. They were one of the biggest proponents of Python at the time, and frankly they were part of what made it so successful. With their work on Unladen Swallow not making meaningful progress and the Python core developers concentrating on Python 3000, making it clear that they don&#x27;t even care, it isn&#x27;t a wonder that Google was hedging their bets by hiring Rob Pike to work on Go, which many now see as most directly being a competitor to Python, and which has sapped a lot of people who would potentially be Python users.<p>Meanwhile, the broken release of 3.0 needs to be blamed for part of the problem, not used as a reason to delay the historical date of fracture: a lot of things were broken in 3.0, including some basic things that Python got wrong in Unicode. The performance regressions were not quickly fixed, making people hesitant of the benefits of Python 3, and the Unicode issues (which were not fixed until years later, when they added the round-trip-safe Unicode conversions; but even this is a workaround, as filenames are defined to be strings of bytes by the filesystem) were ironic as the whole point of Python 3 was to somehow be better at dealing with Unicode :/.<p>And you seem to be forgetting that the real problem was not the features added in 3.0 but the features <i>taken away at the same time</i> that made it impossible to write reasonable code that ran on both 2.7 and 3.0 even for extremely simple cases like &quot;catches an exception&quot;. They only just a year or so ago have started to crack their party line of &quot;shut up and upgrade to 3: it is better and you are wrong&quot; and add some backwards compatibility features to 3.x, such as supporting the u prefix (which was the absolute dumbest thing they could have removed).",1447880114

A lot that you can do in &quot;real IDEs&quot; (like building your project) can be handled by Gulp, Grunt, or other runners in a more or less independent way. I actually prefer it this way now, regardless of the IDE I use - that allows my projects to be independent of the IDE.<p>To me, where VSC shines is really in editing comfort, be it with the super fast typing response (really!), or with the Git integration, or with how it handles work space for opened files.

They know &quot;business&quot; so they should be able to apply their knowledge to the software world easily, would be their reasoning. Silicon Valley&#x27;s picks in biotech, like Theranos, have fairly transparently misapplied &quot;knowledge&quot; in the same way. They look for all the wrong things, attributes that work well in software but not other places: 1) confidence bordering on arrogance, 2) dismissal of experts and standard knowledge disguised as an attempt to &quot;innovate.&quot;, and 3) a chance to &quot;hop on&quot; to a rising founder/CEO before they&#x27;ve proven themselves and become super expensive. Similarly, be skeptical of other SV health efforts (such as Google&#x27;s) unless there are real scientists behind it and also real experience in biotech (not tech).<p>Complete Genomics (next to LinkedIn and Google) is an example of what happens to a biotech company that has really great tech, but runs the business like a tech company rather than a biotech company.

This is mainly an artifice of the common constructions, but one can give definitions of the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals where the only difference is that, in several places, one must replace the word &quot;finite&quot; with the word &quot;countable&quot;. Here is one such:<p>The definition of the length of an interval should be obvious. Let I be an interval, and let E be a subset of I. Define its Jordan outer measure to be the inf of the sums  of the lengths of finite collections of intervals covering E. Define its Jordan inner measure to be the length of I minus the Jordan outer measure of I \setminus E. E is called Jordan measurable if its outer and inner Jordan measures are equal. A function s is Jordan simple if it is a linear combination of characteristic functions of Jordan measurable sets. Define the integral of Jordan simple functions in the obvious way. A bounded function on I is Riemann integrable if and only if it is the uniform limit of Jordan simple functions, and its Riemann integral is the limit of the integrals of the approximating simple functions.<p>If, in the previous paragraph, one replaces the word &quot;finite&quot; with the word &quot;countable&quot;, and the names &quot;Jordan&quot; and &quot;Riemann&quot; with &quot;Lebesgue&quot;, one recovers the Lebesgue integral.",1447879753

Data points:<p>EBay (1995) - Perl, rewritten in C++ in 1997, rewritten in Java in 2002.  Google (1998) - C++.  Del.icio.us (2003) - Perl.  GMail (2002) - Perl, rewritten in Java circa 2002.  LiveJournal (2002) - Perl.  Flickr (2004) - PHP.  Facebook (2004) - PHP.  YouTube (2005) - Python.  Reddit (2005) - Lisp, rewritten in Python in 2006.  AirBnB (2006) - Ruby on Rails.  GitHub (2007) - Ruby on Rails.  Dropbox (2007) - Python.  Hacker News (2007) - Arc, YC internal tools (c. 2012) are written in Ruby on Rails.  Twitter (2007) - Ruby on Rails, rewritten 2010 in Java/Scala.  Uber (2010) - Node.js, supposedly this was a rewrite.<p>There are two big caveats:<p>Sometimes a big competitor comes along right when a language is undergoing a massive rewrite - for example, it looked like Perl would own the Internet around 2003, but just a couple years later we got Rails and Django and Perl stagnated with Perl 6, and so Perl jobs are nowhere near as hot as they would otherwise be.  Similarly, Python was poised to take over much of the non-web server space in 2008, but in 2009 Node.js came out just as Python was losing steam in the Python 3 transition.  Python still remains pretty hot (it&#x27;s been helped by its use in data science), but it may&#x27;ve lost the startup server market to Node.<p>The other big anomaly is that there was a lot of attention around Haskell and Erlang from 2005 - 2008, and yet these are still niche languages.  Erlang had one big success with Whatsapp and some smaller ones with Facebook chat and CouchDB, but didn&#x27;t really become mainstream.  My hypothesis there is that because both of these were old languages that were rediscovered, they were built with some assumptions (eg. strings are lists, or funky POSIX interfaces) that didn&#x27;t fit modern startup development, and so they couldn&#x27;t gain critical mass.  But then, both Python and Ruby were old languages that were rediscovered; perhaps it was the sudden resurgence of Linux (which both Python and Ruby were steeped in) along with the web that carried them forwards.",1447879529

Then the Apostle went out to the market of Medina (which is still its market today) and dug trenches in it. Then he sent for them and struck off their heads in those trenches as they were brought out to him in batches. Among them was the enemy of Allah Huyayy b. Akhtab and Ka`b b. Asad their chief. There were 600 or 700 in all, though some put the figure as high as 800 or 900. As they were being taken out in batches to the Apostle they asked Ka`b what he thought would be done with them. He replied, &#x27;Will you never understand? Don&#x27;t you see that the summoner never stops and those who are taken away do not return? By Allah it is death!&#x27; This went on until the Apostle made an end of them. Huyayy was brought out wearing a flowered robe in which he had made holes about the size of the finger-tips in every part so that it should not be taken from him as spoil, with his hands bound to his neck by a rope. When he saw the Apostle he said, &#x27;By God, I do not blame myself for opposing you, but he who forsakes God will be forsaken.&#x27; Then he went to the men and said, &#x27;God&#x27;s command is right. A book and a decree, and massacre have been written against the Sons of Israel.&#x27; Then he sat down and his head was struck off.<p>This actually says that Mohammed himself beheaded the Jews, but even if he didn&#x27;t, he allowed it to happen.

This can be made even fairer if you aggregate it over two years, and then tie the number of immigrants to the inflation rate.

Companies like TCS, Wipro etc typically have 100s thousands of such workers for sell. The reason this is slavery is because your ability to negotiate your wages is extremely limited. Sure, you can transfer your H1B but companies which accommodates such transfer is few and far between because of cost and legal people they have to keep on their staff. Most startups are immediately out of question for employment, for example. Further, if your H1B is coupled with green card application then it puts further friction in changing jobs.<p>So in effect, H1B is just glorified tech slavery. The way to fix this system would be to allow H1B workers to apply anywhere they want without effecting other processes such as green cards. This would immediately not only stop slave labor but also bring wage parity to market.",1447879228

10590565,comment,10588342,10588589,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Basic man-page style documentation for your own scripts comes practically free with powershell. Powershell uses named parameters (though technically you&#x27;re not forced to do so) with command-line tab-completion. Powershell uses a standardized verb+noun syntax design which makes it slightly easier to figure out what commands are what. Powershell uses an object pipeline instead of plain text.<p>This is the spirit of unix taken to the next generation. It&#x27;s an incredibly useful CLI environment and pipeline which makes it easy to combine small tools to achieve powerful functionality while also facilitating making scripts by making them easier to use and easier to write.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say I wanted to find every process using more than 100m of ram. With powershell that&#x27;s just:<p><pre><code>  get-process | where WorkingSet -gt 100e6\n</code></pre>\nBecause powershell is object based you gain a lot more potency in the command pipeline. For example, let&#x27;s say I wanted to kill all processes that matched a certain filter. That&#x27;s as easy as piping the output of get-process through some filters then into stop-process. Let&#x27;s say instead I wanted to wait until all instances of firefox are closed, that&#x27;s just this:<p><pre><code>  get-process | where path -like &#x27;*\firefox.exe&#x27; | %{ $_.WaitForExit() }\n</code></pre>\nPowershell is far from perfect and it has a few very annoying gotchas here and there, but so does bash, python, and any other language for that matter. Powershell is a very powerful language that has benefited from a lot of rethinking of some of the traditions in command line interfaces that exist solely because that&#x27;s how it used to work back in the day despite the reasons for those choices no longer pertaining in the here and now (teletype terminals, slow connections, slow everything, etc.).",1447878990

Over the years, I replaced this plugin with a simple 5-line script so I can reproduce my passwords from anywhere, strengthened the hash function from SHA-1 to bcrypt, and also added a configurable password length so I can gradually grow passwords over time as computers grow more powerful.

The reason for this is that when you transfer visa they require you to provide pay stubs for at least trailing 3 months.

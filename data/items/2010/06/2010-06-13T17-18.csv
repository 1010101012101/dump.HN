1427808,comment,1427599,1427599,0,0,albertzeyer,,,"Such functional code in C++ doesn't need to be bad. Though I would have coded it a bit different:<p><pre><code>    int Dice::total() const {

This allows some more flexibility. For example, you could also provide other implementations of sum.

possible misunderstandings.  To be clear:  I oppose the granting of
monopolies, maintained by force, as in the patent system.  I view this exactly
as you do:  as a restriction of your rights to use your own property.<p>To me, intellectual property has nothing to do with owning ""ideas.""  I think
purely in terms of physics -- mere arrangements of atoms and electrons.  For
example, when I publish computer source code, I think about that act in very primitive physical terms, as follows.<p>I publish my code on a server.  The physical particles of that server
are now arranged in a different way.  I have also physically configured
the server so that another individual somewhere in the universe can
observe its structure, up to a point.<p>When the other individual observes the state of the server, she alters
the physical structure of a device that she owns, for example a digital
computer or her own brain.  That device is her <i>property</i>.<p>So, by publishing the code in that way, I have taken an explicit, deliberate,
and voluntary action which enabled the other individual to alter the physical
state of a device she <i>owns</i> in a specific way.  That device was her property
before she altered it, and it remains her property after the she altered it.
If I did not want that individual to alter her property in that way,
I should not have made it possible.  It was my choice.<p>I concur with your emphasis on the right of contract.  After all, that is how people transfer property rights between each other.  All I am saying that so-called ""intellectual"" property should be no different -- since it too is all about the configuration and movement of physical devices.",1276450802

But why is that barrier to entry there?<p>From the point of view of the employer, a degree indicates that the possessor has, among other things, a certain level of intelligence, literacy (not a small deal in a country where over half the country is functionally illiterate!), experience in learning, general background, work ethic, and socio-economic status.  It is therefore a somewhat useful filter to apply for many professions.<p>Of course most of those traits have nothing to do with what you actually <i>learned</i> in university.  And there certainly are plenty of successful people with all of those traits who did not bother with university.  So even though I believe that for most people, education is worthwhile to that person, I'm far less certain that society as a whole benefits much from all of the money spent on higher education.  (And I become even less certain when I look at how wasteful the process has become.  Costs have been going up faster than inflation for decades, with no apparent reason than that everyone in the process knows that they are free to raise costs by that much, and it is always easier to spend more money than it is to spend less.)",1276450772

1427771,comment,1427054,1427133,0,0,t_androidicus,,,"I feel like this article conflates individual cost/opportunity with economy-wide cost/opportunity and then comes to a very wrong and dangerous conclusion.<p>-The individual case: First, the average graduate with a bachelors earns $50k and the average HS graduate earns $30k (1).  So, let's take the worst case scenario, namely that you decided to go out of state without any financial aid.  Your opportunity cost is $120k and your out of pocket expenditure is going to be roughly $160k for a total of $280k, which will take 14 years to amortize.  I personally came out of college with $4k in debt, and worked p/t and in the summer to pay for rent and food (probably $10k/yr), which I would have had to pay for anyway, so if we adjust the opportunity cost accordingly, that's $80k + $4k = $84k which will take me 4 years to bring to parity. Not to mention, I'll probably enjoy the college educated work quite a bit more. Further, the opportunity cost issue doesn't take into account the fact that I got to spend four years studying abroad, partying with gorgeous coeds, etc.<p>-The economy-wide case: The key point to note here is that educated workers contribution to the economy is vastly greater than just their salary.  If you work at Apple, your work is worth $1.3 million per year (2), and if you work at Matrixx Initiatives your work is worth $3.4 million per year (3). Now, let's say that the $500k figure is accurate.  If you're a Matrixx Initiatives employee, in just one year, you justify the entire education of seven people. Of course it's all way more complicated than that: these employees probably have more than bachelors, if they'd started work at six or seven years old in a factory, they would have an extra fifteen or so years of income, etc., but if everyone went to the factories instead of school, our economy would probably look more like Vietnam's.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.earnmydegree.com/online-education/learning-center/education-value.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.earnmydegree.com/online-education/learning-center...</a>

Selection pressure is a scarce resource. It protects existing adaptations from the ever-present entropic decay of mutation. Genes that are not selected for, relative to the other genes in the population, will <i>reliably</i> fall apart due to lack of maintenance and their effects will disappear. A gene must <i>continually</i> justify its survival by outperforming competing mutant alleles. It's just not true that group selection is merely weak, or a secondary effect occurring only when genetic selection allows it. The aggregate contribution of group selection to a gene's survival is <i>literally zero</i>.<p>I'm not arguing that music isn't adaptive. It's plausible that its adaptive value is to display to potential mates how well one's brain processes rhythm, which is useful for any number of physical activities as Pinker points out in the interview. But that's different than being selected for because it makes the group more cohesive. It may even, in fact, make the group more cohesive, but this will have nothing to do with why it was selected. This would have to be a happenstance byproduct, and thus not a plausible explanation for the existence of a complex adaptation like music.

The human mind is very good at adaptation, and often it’s astonishing what we will perceive as ""normal."" Familiarity only comes from constant exposure, though, which means that languages with relatively simple syntax become familiar more quickly. Lisp is at one extreme, with only one syntactic construct. It’s very easy to become familiar with Lisp, although grasping the large Common Lisp standard library is another matter. I tend to agree with the author that C++ is a language at the other extreme. Most C++ coders I have encountered use only a relatively small subset of the C++ language. Worse yet, everyone uses a slightly different subset.<p>Of course, the biggest impact on readability comes not from the language, but from the developer. A poor developer can write illegible code in any language. A good developer? I’ve even seen well-written, readable Visual Basic code (once).",1276448704

THe problem for me with freelancing is that I don't really have any recent projects for a portfolio site (plus most of my work was confidential)<p>Thanks again.",1276448670

Stigum, <i>The Money Market</i> and it really opened my eyes to how banks and investments worked -- at least back then! I spent the next year or so interested in Finance but then gradually lost interest.<p>Money and Finance are important to entrepreneurship, so it's not surprising that there are a lot of knowledgeable people around here. But one nice thing about HN is that you could probably ask a question about just about anything technically interesting in any field and get a bunch of good, informed answers from people with real knowledge of the domain :-)",1276448400

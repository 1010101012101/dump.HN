They controlled for there just being a picture by alternating pictures of eyeballs with pictures of flowers.<p>I suspect part of it may be due to people showing up just for the novelty of it, but going back to the eyeball study (which I am too lazy to look up the reference for) I wonder if there is another thing at play too. Perhaps people think oh cool, let's show up and game the system, and they make plans to go there <i>intending</i> to perhaps pay 20% less than market.<p>Then they have to look the owner in the eye and tell him what they think is fair, and for whatever reason their mind changes.  So rather than paying .8x, like they originally intended, they end up paying instead x - 1.2x<p>So you get increased business because people who were willing to pay .8x (lets say x = $10 based on the article, so $8) show up, and end up spending x - 1.2x ($10-12, per the article).  Some portion of new customers may see that their game won't work (because they don't want to lie to the owner) and they just leave. No harm done - these people weren't eating at the cafe to begin with.<p>So I chalk at least part of this up to a neat psychological trick - but I wonder if many of those people will be repeat customers (some portion obviously will).<p>Anybody have references to back this up?

If the problem had been allowed to run its course, a bankruptcy judge would have determined how to discharge all of the company's debts.<p>But that time is past. The US government has elected to keep AIG afloat, and to do so without allowing the company to reorganize its debts. Thus, it still owes 100% of its debts to all of its creditors.<p>The company cannot now go picking and choosing which debts to pay. To do so would do far more damage than failing to retain the executives in question now. While the US government has been trying to shore up confidence in AIG, an action like this would cause ALL of its creditors to question whether the debts that it is owed would be the next to be ignored. Thus, failing to pay these debts would set expectations that future debt might not be paid. This risk would at best increase all costs to AIG, and at worst completely prevent it from doing any business in the future when they can't be trusted.<p>In short, welching on these debts would likely lead to exactly the problem that the government has decided must be avoided.",1237412531

If you get a loyal fan following then this would be a great revenue source. Once people are emotionally tied into a game then it can often keep them in the game for many, many years.<p>If you could keep a lot of the heavy work on client-side (not unreasonable for modern computers if you're producing a non-CPU intensive game by nature) so that your bandwidth and server needs stay low, then once you break-even you'd hopefully be able to keep a large chunk of that $60k.<p>Correctly done, I imagine an MMO could quite possibly be the best way an ""indie"" developer could make big money without a publisher taking a huge cut. I mean sure if you can get a publisher to sell the game for $20 or so and let them take most of it to help grow your users, but keep the monthly fees in your pocket.",1237412381

I didn't look at your links, yet, Wallflower (my apology, but I wanted to respond before I got sidetracked).<p>Your text did mention Beloit and ""not for beginners"".  This suddenly made me think further of my own experiences.  Middlebury's program was billed as ""immersion"", and you actually signed a ""contract"" of sorts stating that you would use the language you were learning exclusively at all times to the best extent possible.<p>Sounds really impressive, up front.  In practice, many of the beginning class members were not that motivated and they mostly spoke English outside of class.  The amount of effort and success varied, and plenty of people showed some good will effort.  But the ""immersion"" experience did not match the marketing.<p>I was more than a little frustrated by this.  But in terms of a lesson to pass on, I would say not to allow yourself to be intimidated by such marketing language.  If you have an honest intent to learn and practice, that's probably going to quickly place in you the top 25% of performers, regardless of your starting ability.<p>I also spent some time during college in Munich, Germany, as part of an exchange program.  Again, the program billed itself as ""advanced"" and requiring fluency and daily use of German.  In practice, a lot of those kids could barely string a sentence together.  (And you haven't lived until you've heard German spoken with a full on Dallas drawl. ;-)  It seems that one kind of marketing for these language courses focuses on projecting the image of ""advanced learners"".  My personal, anecdotal experience is that, for the U.S. audience, at least, and a couple of decades ago, this was consistently, dramatically exaggerated.<p>Don't let a bunch of attitude put you off.  If you really want to learn, you're already ahead of 4/5 of the pack.<p>Cheers!",1237412295

The ability to read, understand and change each others code should just be built into the development process instead of trying to force an artificial level of quality/shared-knowledge via PP.<p>As an example, in my spare time I'm implementing a simple and clean Ruby version of some core functionality that we have in C# and JS (yes, I know, odd combination).

I was well beyond the norm for that class, but it was not an exceptional amount of work.<p>The instructors there were a real credit.  And it was a kick to sit down at dinner with people from the more advanced classes (including graduate level learners) and have them respond somewhat incredulously, ""You're in BEGINNING French?""<p>It was fun -- a lot of fun, and mentally challenging in a good way.  That made it easy to do.<p>The Middlebury French program was just beginning to use a new video based course course instruction / materials.  This didn't reduce the contribution of their instructors, but it enhanced the experience significantly.  It really helped in presenting French as actually spoken (well, relatively so; it's still relatively free of the everyday slang and contractions).  It also presented language use <i>in context</i>.  You saw the setting in which things were being discussed and used.  There was a lot of supplementary information regarding (Parisian) French culture and behavior, that you picked up not deliberately but as much by osmosis while watching the story within the lessons.  And there was just that, a running storyline that helped you to stay engaged and curious as to how it would unfold.  It was somewhat campy, deliberately so and with an open wink, but nonetheless enjoyable.  Finally, you could watch the videos as often as you liked.  Something I found possible with the videos, while language audio tapes almost immediately put me to sleep.<p>(Actually, the Middlebury instructor was godmother to the video course developer/instructor's daughter.  She had a very good handle on the material and an excellent pedagogical pedigree.  Her assistant was equally excellent.)<p>For Spanish, there is at least one instructional course I am aware of that uses videos.

Very guilty.<p>In terms of my own ideal moral boundaries? Well, it depends on the circumstances. I will refer to this hypothetical person as X.<p>1. If X made/caused to be made the images: Guilty beyond doubt. Lock X up and throw away the key. Sexual assault of a 7yo? Are you kidding? Absolutely wrong and absolutely should be removed from society before more harm is caused.<p>2. If X did not make the images but contributed to their creation via payment: Guilty. By payment, he has directly helped fund this and future crimes.<p>3. If X did not make the images but contributed to their creation by other means: Grey area. Could be considered part of a conspiracy to commit a crime. Would depend on the circumstances.<p>4. If X did not make the images and had no link to the person(s) who did: Not guilty, of course. There is no link between him and the crime. He merely has a visual record. Obviously a promising candidate for counselling, however. To be treated the same was as, say, someone found with 10GB of execution photos/videos.<p>I wonder what answer you were expecting? I am sorry but I just cannot accept that making a copy of a file can be considered a criminal offence or even wrong.<p>I consider anyone who rapes 7yo kids to be utterly reprehensible, by the way. That is fucking sick. Lock up anyone who does that, forever, and I will applaud you. But possessing an image of the crime in progress? That should not be a crime, that should never be a crime, that should not even be able to be a crime.",1237410614

Indeed, 'services' is a different industry, and it's not like you can just pick up from one day to the next and become a services company.  IBM managed to do that, so maybe they would be a good fit, but it's not an easy thing to accomplish in any case.",1237410592

If reddit went under tomorrow and disappeared from the web, users would find a new site (voat.co, some other reddit clone, it doesnt matter) and congregate there.<p>Are they allowed to monetise their site? Yes of course they are. However there is a fine line between monestising a social media site and killing it. Just look at Digg, they tried to give to much power to superusers and sites that gained traffic from them. Result the users left in droves so that they werent spoon fed corporate shit. It went from a valuation of $150m to being sold for under half a million. It will never regain what it was, diggs are no longer even measure don the site.<p>The same thing could happen to reddit. The CEOs job is to monetise the site, but if you kill the site you can not monetise it. This is why reddit needs a CEO that the users like. If ellen pao fucks up the monetisation in such a way that it alienates users they will not be forgiving. If the users like a CEO and the CEO fucked up then they are more likely to forgive and remain redditors than if they hate the CEO and the fuckup is the straw that breaks the camels back.",1436219917

Additionally, just because something is the consensus, doesn&#x27;t mean it is necessarily the best course of action individually. Facing condemnation is a consequence, not physical law. The initial response took no time to give an appropriate course of action, and drew on your subjective heated feelings attached to your interpretation of the consensus.<p>There is no need to do a scientific analysis to derive majority consensus. Intuition is enough to know what the majority thinks about stealing your best friends girlfriend.  Whether or not the majority consensus is the &quot;best&quot; course of action for the individual is not what I addressed. I specifically stated that my advice was from a moral standpoint, whether or not the OP considers that as &quot;best&quot; depends on whether or not he is a moral man.<p>The initial response gave a appropriate course of action from a moral standpoint. It drew from a combination of sources all of which can be potentially described as subjective, moral, rational, emotional, heated yet still valid.",1436219915

There are a lot of sensible gun owners out there, as there are a lot of people who only wish for better enforcement of gun control laws or better background checks.<p>As far as people who want to ban guns outright, there are certainly people who believe fervently in that, but I think a lot of those people don&#x27;t necessarily think about the enormous financial and human cost of doing so.  They look at a country like Japan and say, &quot;See, if we ban guns like they did...&quot;  But ultimately if someone seeks to confiscate guns by force, they&#x27;re advocating for violence because there are many, many people who would kill and die for the 2nd amendment.  Most people don&#x27;t see it that way, but in practice that is what it would come down to.<p>I agree that a lot of extreme pro-gun folks are opposed to any and all sorts of compromise.

9842408,comment,9840805,9842349,0,0,celticninja,,,"> Reddit has had several CEOs, which the typical user rarely knew by name.<p>I have to say that is wrong. Yishan Wong was the CEO before Ellen Pao. He posted on the site often, he made a bunch of announcements on the site as CEO. Users were well aware of who he was. Prior to that reddit was under CondeNast publications and whilst the CEO of conde nast may not have been well know the admins such as kn0thing, spex, jedberg etc were all well know active users on the site from its inception.  There has always been communication between admins with the users through the site.<p>>The idea that the CEO of Reddit has anything to do with the average user&#x27;s experience has come about very recently<p>Again this is wrong. In terms of CEOs Yishan Wong engaged users this when he joined. This was not something that has come about in the last 6 weeks as a result of r/fph being banned.<p>>The mishandling of IAmA seems to have been done by Alexei Ohanian, but he&#x27;s not being photoshopped onto Hitler.<p>Again this is wrong. Ohanian (kn0thing) certainly got involved in the immediate aftermath. I presume because they thought it would be accepted more easily by users if he said it rather than Ellen Pao saying it. He made a faux pas at one point and took some flak for it, but he understands reddit and he had some serious goodwill in the bank so he leveraged that and things are looking peachy for him now. But there is no indication that he was to blame for the AMA mishandling at all, his role appears to be cleanup.",1436219486

Accordingly, we have O = {0,...,n}.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this definition gives any insight on the nature of object oriented programming.<p>Now for the strangest thing: The definitions of &quot;object oriented&quot; and &quot;procedural&quot; involve differentiating between possible condidates for S. Yet the only property a set without any context really has is its cardinality.<p>So we can rephrase the definitions of &quot;object oriented&quot; as follows:<p>An &quot;object oriented&quot; program is a set S together with a total function S -> S with S finite. ([total function] AND [S finite])<p>Negating, we arrive at the definition of &quot;procedural program&quot;:<p>A &quot;procedural&quot; program is either a relation S <-> S that is not a total function (no restrictions on the cardinality of S) OR any relation S<->S but S must be infinite.

While I think that there are definite issues on both sides -- I&#x27;m not a moderator, especially not of a big subreddit, so I don&#x27;t know how disrespectful or how much the admins ignored the moderators requests, so my perspective is of an outsider -- I really feel like this is all just a temper tantrum that the moderators handled poorly, potentially purposefully. The users by and large did not need to know that Victoria was fired, and it&#x27;s a shame that the moderators 1) let that information out, and 2) by letting it out, effectively let it be used as a base for a parade against Ellen Pao. It can&#x27;t be argued that the moderators didn&#x27;t/couldn&#x27;t know this would happen because this kind of shit happens on Reddit all the time, and the more vocal parts of the community will cling to their dislike of Pao with this.<p>I think that the admins should have handled it better, for sure -- they could have at least given the moderators that relied on Victoria&#x27;s help the heads up of, &quot;hey, we are going to transition to a new community manager, for the time being X, Y, and Z are going to occur,&quot; but the backlash from the community and that the moderators are effectively using the community for their own gains instead of trying to handle it internally is a pretty bad reflection on how the community is structured as a whole.

If everything you have to compare it to as possible outcomes is worse than what happened then you did nothing wrong or bad, you did the best that was possible.<p>I was never intending to say guilt does not exist just that it simply as Webster has defined and that choosing solutions which you later realize are sub-optimal are what Webster describes as something bad or wrong.  I am not pretending it means anything other than what you have provided here as the definition.  How can one recognize bad without good?  These things are inherently relative as one can not exist  without the other also existing.<p>>I didn&#x27;t say there was an absolute definition of right and wrong.

It can be defined in a relative sense, so I stand by my view that the relative sense is the only one that matters.<p>>By weakening to just the idea that certain actions in a definite fixed context could be correctly labeled &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, you pick up many, many more believers, practically the entire world.<p>I think you underestimate the cultural differences present in the world and the ability of anyone to actually define a fixed context which &#x27;practically the entire world&#x27; will be able to relate to.<p>Any scenario you did manage to get &#x27;practically the entire world&#x27; to agree on would be so vague and hypothetical as to be virtually meaningless.

By 1935, Goedel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems had shown the limitations of this (and any other) foundation of mathematics.<p>Hoare logic is not a foundation of maths, but an approach towards specification and verification of programs. As such it is in the same space as Curry-Howard based programming languages like Idris and Agda with dependent types. The main differences between the two are that (1) Hoare logic is not restricted to constructive reasoning and (2) Hoare logic is not integrated with the programming language, so programming and proving are <i>distinct</i> activities. Depending on your philosophical outlook, either (1) or (2) or both can be seen as major advantage or disadvantage.<p><pre><code>    how to do this automatically\n</code></pre>\nWhat do you mean by &quot;this&quot;? Automatically specifying programs semantics, or automatically proving program properties?<p><pre><code>   determining the formal semantics ... is still open research \n</code></pre>\nThis is somewhat misleading. Every compiler gives a perfectly formal semantics to the programming language it compiles.

Just because users have certain expectations of a site, that the site itself may or may not have actually promised, does not make the site immune from competition.<p>So in reality, it&#x27;s not so much about users feeling entitled to anything, it&#x27;s that reddit seems to have been getting complacent about what it feels it needs to deliver to stay relevant to its content producers and power users (which are the main drivers of a site like that).<p>Companies can dictate how their services are used all they want, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they have an automatic right to remain successful/profitable/relevant, especially if how they went about dictating their terms hurt their PR (whether reasonably or not).",1436216750

He&#x27;ll receive a picture of his girlfriend with another man&#x27;s semen plastered on it.<p>You learn to ignore it - because there isn&#x27;t another way to deal with it. Blaming a specific community for it is a joke. What do you want the community to do about it? Say it&#x27;s not okay?<p>Well it&#x27;s not okay. We say that, but it falls on deaf ears. You want us to <i>do</i> something about it. But there isn&#x27;t anything to do about it. Simply saying it&#x27;s not okay isn&#x27;t enough. It won&#x27;t stop what happens. If you think it will, I&#x27;d love to hear your reasoning for how you came to that conclusion and what alternative universe you&#x27;ve wished yourself into.<p>Telling people that theft is not okay doesn&#x27;t prevent all theft. Telling people that killing people is not okay doesn&#x27;t prevent all murders. Telling people that [this] is not okay does not prevent all [this]. That&#x27;s simply a fact of life.<p>What people are saying is: &quot;No, this isn&#x27;t okay. It&#x27;s still going to happen. What do you want us to do about it, we can&#x27;t do shit. You&#x27;re going to have to deal with it.&quot;<p>Somehow that gets interpreted as &quot;This is okay, we endorse it. We aren&#x27;t going to do anything about it.&quot;",1436216486

Besides 135 lbs for someone who is 5.8 is a very healthy weight.  You are exercising regularly which is great, so you are probably not likely to reduce cardiovascular risk much more, if that can even be quantified realistically at this point.  Running is hard on your knees, period.  If you want to go easier on your knees maybe take up biking or swimming.",1436216431

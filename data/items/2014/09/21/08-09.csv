Thinking it through, I can see smart founders ending up at different stock allocations that are best for the future of the companies based off of info that&#x27;s not listed in the YC application, and some of allocations could be potential signals for very different realities (a lopsided split could signal a strong, persuasive founder #1 or a less committed founder #2 ). I&#x27;m curious to know what useful signals you can get from knowing the stock allocation.&quot;",1411289925
8346682,comment,8339135,8346042,2,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids<p>Not aware of any grand genetic behavioral traits to things like theft, murder, violence, rape discussed in this book. Nor does it particularly concern itself with the effect of socioeconomic status or the environment(low-income, illiterate parents, lack of books/newspapers in the home etc, stigma of members of certain minorities etc). It really only concerns itself with parenting style (&#x27;tiger mom&#x27; vs &#x27;sure you can watch TV and eat pizza&#x27;) and even here he suggests that there are indeed effects of parenting on intelligence up to a certain age. And within even this limited frakework it&#x27;s quite a contrarian view that many sociologists don&#x27;t share, most I would even say from my experience in the field.<p>But beyond that, it doesn&#x27;t provide an argument for the case that entire ethnic groups are genetically lesser persons. I mean really, what are we debating here. Just say it straight up, do you really believe in this idea of the untermensch ubermensch, because that&#x27;s what it comes down to. I reject such a notion that one ethnic or racial group is better than the other, I&#x27;m curious if you don&#x27;t.<p>Some immigrant groups (e.g., Vietnamese refugees) don&#x27;t seem to need a &quot;fair shot&quot;. They do well all by themselves. Why is that?<p>There are many reasons, because they are genetically better is not one of them according to me. And this is the overwhelming view in academia. You keep leaving me curious where you stand with questions that seem rhetorical, so as to continuously imply &#x27;why is that? well it must be that some ethnicities or countries have better genes&#x27;, not asked merely in curiosity of an answer.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_minority"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_minority</a><p>> Racism by the rest of society doesn&#x27;t work well as the sole additional variable<p>Agreed, nobody said it was the sole variable. But to go against decades and decades of conclusions of the effect of discrimination is laughable, even to imply it or hint at it. Of course it doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s zero success in people from minority backgrounds, and that the moment there&#x27;s one segment of a minority who succeeds you can claim &#x27;oh, but then racism didn&#x27;t matter at all&#x27;. Why even bring this up if you know better. This will probably be my last post.<p>Especially as you&#x27;ve essentially agreed and raised the final point I wanted to make, that this indeed cuts against genetic explanations. As does the earlier wiki link I posted, where you see that each society has a model minority and they&#x27;re wildly different, and are generally explained by socioeconomic status or attitudes towards e.g. education, the family etc. Again, I&#x27;ve lived in Europe all my life, born and raised here, I&#x27;ve lived with the North-African immigrants who were illiterate and uneducated people who live in little moutain villages isolated from modernity. The Arab equivalent of the stereotypical redneck with all due respect, only without literacy or any education. Of course they&#x27;ll perform poorly in the city-life of a different country, culture. But I&#x27;ve also lived with North African immigrants with similar genes, who were university schooled and lived in cities, and they perform very well here, with no difference in genes.<p>>> I  just don&#x27;t think the story is as simple as you or the OP are making it out to be<p>That&#x27;s fine, it indeed is a very complex subject and any posts totaling 2 pages of text of course aren&#x27;t enough to explain the complete economic, cultural, social, financial and political success of natives and immigrants in tens of countries and wildly different situations. To say anything about such a large group of people in such a large set of different situations in one or two pages of text requires an oversimplification!<p>I agree with you here. I&#x27;ve merely tried to hint at some of the ideas that sociologists in my experience and study seem to overwhelmingly hold, which is simply NOT a race-based theory of genetically inferior and superior races/ethnicities/countries, I hope that much is clear.<p>Anyway thanks for the chat :)",1411289918

They aren&#x27;t as concerned with maintaining old friendships as adults or twenty-somethings because, well, they don&#x27;t have many old friendships. They see, on a daily basis, almost everyone they know and have ever known, and for those they don&#x27;t see, Snapchat serves just fine. For now.<p>As people get older, staying in touch and recording memories feels increasingly important. Facebook, a sort of nostalgia machine, is much better at capturing that kind of coherent narrative than, say, Instagram, and so people naturally migrate there as they leave college and lose touch.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a study that tracks social network usage from age 12 to age 25. My bet, which is obviously informed by a the kind of anecdotes you&#x27;re gesturing to above, is that you&#x27;d see higher usage of &quot;ephemeral&quot;-type social networks in the early years (because young kids can&#x27;t see past their noses and have relatively few memories) that tracks inversely with usage of networks whose content has longer-term value as time passes.",1411289241

The potential is obvious, but since SDK 0.4.0, the Rift comes with a huge on-screen disclaimer that can&#x27;t officially be disabled (much to the annoyance of developers) that it is not for use by minors.<p>The reason is that much more research is needed to determine whether or not VR headsets are safe for developing eyes and brains. When you are using a VR headset, you are continually focused on infinity, which is not natural.<p>Sim sickness also continues to be a problem. Again it is not known whether there are potentially damaging effects while the brain is still in development. I would expect especially younger children to compensate for sim sickness for more readily than adults do, but who knows if that is at the expense of their balance and coordination in the real world? Right now, we don&#x27;t.<p>University-level education, yes: VR will yield immediate tangible benefits. The truly big gains for general education cannot come until these problems can be worked out, which hopefully will be somewhere around CV3-CV4 (say around 5 years out). It won&#x27;t be a solved problem within a year or two, unfortunately.",1411288475

The one thing they&#x27;re most afraid of is the one thing that restores equilibrium and stops their ability to gouge, which is real competition and a true free market undistorted by unfair practices and insurance company leeches.<p>Non-catastrophic medical insurance should be outlawed and clients should have to pay their doctors directly, forcing doctors to charge a reasonable amount of money or have no clients, forcing suppliers to charge a reasonable amount of money or have no customers, forcing medical schools to charge a reasonable amount of money or have no students. We can&#x27;t just keep saying &quot;The expensive way of doing this is easy and great, so let&#x27;s just have the government pay for it.&quot; Things must be self-sufficient.",1411287395

They usually don&#x27;t scale well to more general programming. For example, they are great for representing the flow of data through a network of functions but not so great at showing things like loops or recursion. That said, I do think graphics (and music) apps are at the forefront of &quot;visual programming&quot; but they are often not talked about in the context of programming language research. Language designers should be looking to them for inspiration.",1411286402

I know last time through Arizona he played Comerica Theatre (capacity 5500) and on this tour he is playing the Celebrity Theatre (capacity 2650). I would guess that this specific venue change was due to Comerica Theatre not wanting to work with his exclusive ticketing.",1340668696

4159387,comment,4158865,4159318,3,0,DeepDuh,,,"I agree that it's always a target conflict. I'm just not convinced that gc is the way to go in an environment where optimization might become important. GC lets you get a correctly working program easier, but once you are into optimizing runtime performance you quickly loose that advantage, often by simulating memory management with pools. Take a look at the new Obj C with automatic reference counting. It lets you forget about the standard case and only requires you to take action for circular reference by defining them weak - thus it replaces a hard problem to solve with an easy one. For my taste that's the right balance in an environment that is run close to the hardware.",1340668676

4159381,comment,4158536,4159242,13,0,asanwal,,,"I'm a first generation American (parents immigrated) and my wife and I are currently raising our daughter in the US, and so I think I have both an American and non-American perspective to some extent.  (warning: this is based on a data point of 1)<p>First, I do think American kids are spoiled (and I prob am spoiling my daughter no matter my desire not to).  I don't think this is an American thing necessarily and prob more of a wealth/prosperity/Maslow's hierarchy thing.<p>My parents were the typical immigrant story.  They came here with nothing, knew nobody and so they worked to make it.  There wasn't time to ""find oneself"" or just do what makes you happy or to read about how to parent in some magazine.  And so the ethos in our house was you work hard and you get what you deserve as a result.  There was no tolerance for whining, entitlement and tantrums and there was an appreciation for what we had that was instilled in us.  For example, I was told to only take as much as food I could eat at dinner and that I could not get up until I finished every bit of food I chose to take.  I would fall asleep at the table some times eating cold food 3 hours afterwards.  Not fun at the time, but there was to be an appreciation for how fortunate we are.  Some might view this as draconian but it's now somewhat oddly a fond memory of mine from childhood.<p>But I think scarcity of resources (translation: not being wealthy/materially prosperous) doesn't allow one to be spoiled and gives one perspective which is often what seems to be lost.<p>Now I fast forward to today, and I see tons of parenting advice which almost tries to make parenting a paint by numbers effort, a kids culture of ""everybody is a winner"" and conspicuous consumption (bigger bday parties, expensive strollers, etc) that suggest to folks that good parenting is possible out of a book of academic studies, is driven by always being encouraging and giving your kid material crap.  And its this cocktail of things that seems to lead to spoiled kids.<p>This is a stream-of-consciousness rant so apologies for that.",1340668610

If you come into it with an open mind you start to really appreciate the ways in which it has made decisions for you.  Even if you don't agree 100% with the decisions it made, the reasons why those decisions were made can always be reasoned out and the consistency enforced by those decisions is well worth the learning curve it takes to get used to them (IMO).",1340667871

4159322,comment,4159316,4159316,19,0,geekfactor,,,"The site is down, but here is the text:<p><i>hello folks! I'm going on tour this year from October through Feb. I'll be all over the goddamn place. This year, I'm trying something new, building on the fun, success and fan-benifit of selling my content online. We are selling tickets to this tour exclusively here on louisck.com. I only wanted to do this if there was a way, like with LIVE AT THE BEACON, that it could bring the price of tickets down and make them easier and less complicated to buy. We figured out a way.</i><p><i>Making my shows affordable has always been my goal but two things have always worked against that. High ticket charges and ticket re-sellers marking up the prices. Some ticketing services charge more than 40% over the ticket price and, ironically, the lower I've made my ticket prices, the more scalpers have bought them up, so the more fans have paid for a lot of my tickets.</i><p><i>By selling the tickets exclusively on my site, I've cut the ticket charges way down and absorbed them into the ticket price. To buy a ticket, you join NOTHING. Just use your credit card and buy the damn thing. opt in to the email list if you want, and you'll only get emails from me.</i><p><i>Also, you'll see that if you try to sell the ticket anywhere for anything above the original price, we have the right to cancel your ticket (and refund your money). this is something I intend to enforce. There are some other rules you may find annoying but they are meant to prevent someone who has no intention of seeing the show from buying the ticket and just flipping it for twice the price from a thousand miles away.
Some of these rules may be a pain in your ass, but please be patient. My goal here is that people coming to see my shows are able to pay a fair price and that they be paying just for a ticket. Not also paying an exhorbanant fee for the privalege of buying a ticket.</i><p><i>Tickets across the board, everywhere, are 45 dollars. That's what you'll actually pay. In every case, that will be less than anyone has actually paid to see me (after ticket charges) in about two years and in most cases it's about half of what you paid last year.</i><p><i>The benifit for me is that I won't get angry emails from anyone who paid a ton of money to see me due to circumstances out of my control. That makes me VERY happy. The 45 dollars also includes sales tax, which I'm paying for you. So I'm making more or less depending on the state.</i><p><i>Another benifit to me is also one to you. I get your email address (if you opt in) when you opt in. You don't have to join ANYTHING to buy these tickets and if you opt in, youll only hear from me once in an old man's jizz-cycle.
Obviously none of this means anything if the shows aren't good. So that's up to me. As I do every year, I'll be performing a brand new hour (or more) on all of these shows.
Lastly, it was a real challenge to find venues around the country that could work with our exclusive ticketing service under these perameters. It means I'm playing in very new places. I really appreciate all of these theaters that are letting us give this a try.</i><p><i>Setting up this tour has been fascinating and difficult. this ticketing service is a brand new thing and I really fucking hope it works and that there aren't any problems. If anything comes up, please be patient.</i><p><i>Doing things this way means I""m making less than I would have made if I did a standard tour, using the usual very excellent but expensive ticketing service. In some cities I've had to play smaller venues and do more shows. But I like doing more shows and about a year ago I reached a place where I realized I am making enough money doing comedy so the next thing that interested me is bringing your price down. Either way, I still make a whole lot more than my grandfather who taught math and raised chickens in Michigan.</i><p><i>alright, that's it, folks. I'll be sending this message out to folks on the opt-in list and sending a separate email that lays it out much more simply with the proper links. I am doing this because when I emailed you about LIVE AT CARNEGIE HALL, (which is still on sale for 5 dollars!) about half of the people who got the email really enjoyed the long, verbose, unedited message. The other half HATED it and would have preffered a price, a link, and me shutting the fuck up.
This way, you can read this if you like, or your can just see the massive shit-ball of text and throw it in the garbage, and focus on the simple email.</i><p><i>I hope to see you all on the road.</i><p><i>regards,</i>

Now, over a decade later, I now do the things that others would consider part of being a responsible adult.<p>What changed? A trial-by-fire in autonomy in college that I failed.<p>Basically the story is that I wasn't responsible enough at the time, and it came back to bite me very hard. I returned home with my tail firmly between my legs.<p>But for the first time I had a taste of true freedom. No nagging, no schedules, no authorities telling me what to do. If I didn't want to go to class, nobody was going to make me. If I didn't want to do laundry, then I had a big pile of stinking clothes. If I didn't want to cook, then I spent money on eating out. I painfully learned what it took to take care of myself as an adult. Hell, I'm still learning.<p>Freedom is weird like that. On the one hand, it's the greatest feeling ever. The whole world feels like your oyster. On the other hand, it has a MASSIVE cost in both time and money. Rent, showering, work, food, car, gas, insurance, phone, computer, internet, etc. If you want that kind of freedom, you damn well better earn it.<p>Autonomy is a kind of freedom that I believe we don't give to children here in America. We don't trust them with that kind of freedom, so we swoop in and guide their every move and every minute. This is an enabling behavior because it doesn't allow for children to take responsibility, and yet we want them to magically have it. In fact, I would argue that kids don't even think about the basics because the parents magically take care of it for them, or nag them until it is done.<p>If we want our children to be autonomous and responsible, we need to give them the space to fail and face the intrinsic consequences of that failure without swooping in to help.",1340666796

Individually addressable means the can't run any of them in series - the whole panel needs to run at the forward voltage of the blue leds, or ~3V. I'm assuming they're built out of the individually addressable led strip like I can buy at Adafruit, so 32 tricolour leds per meter, for a total of 64 x 64 leds each with 3 emitters =~ 12,000, which at 20mA for each emitter requires ~250A to drive it all to full brightness white (which'd ""only"" be ~750W). They had 12 of those panels on stage. How the hell do you provide 3000Amps at ~3V? I know that's only ~9kW, which isn't a lot of power (in the context of a concert lighting rig), but doing it at 3V and 3000A is quite a different thing to 110V or 220V lamps drawing ""only"" 80A (or 40A @ 220V) in total. A 3000A power supply must have some impressive amounts of copper leading out of it. Even if it's 12 individual 250A power supplies, that presumably implies thumb-sized or thicker copper wire to pass those currents (and even thicker if the cable runs are any sort of length, the I squared term in I^2 x R power losses mean R needs to be _very_ low at 250A to stop things catching fire)<p>I'd be fascinated to know how they do that",1340666522

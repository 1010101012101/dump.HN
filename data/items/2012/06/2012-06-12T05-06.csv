The ability to have read-only and more importantly write-only access to SQS/S3/SimpleDB is brilliant. What is still needed though is a way to securely manage the keys/certificates on the actual server. Maybe Amazon could build a key store that only unlocks from certain processes at certain times and logs access attempts.",1339480669

There's one thing I wish players in this space would keep in mind: If you want to take a shot at this window of power and performance (the level at which people start thinking ""set-top box"") you really have to beat out the $250 netbook I can get at walmart.

However I think that fundamentally, Samsung cannot really change much. The Korean style of management, with strict adherence to hierarchy and deference to rank, may be the reason why the company can't market its own technologies (I'm completely speculating of course, but I have a strong feeling that this might be correct). Another reason may be that it is quite successful outside US. (e.g in India, Samsung == Apple in quality; that is the perception)",1339480623

How many ""apps"" have you installed lately which are really just local servers with web front-ends?  Qt-based stuff?  Java SWT/Swing?  What else?  While many of these apps likely are built upon 3rd party components developed using Visual Studio (perhaps a free version), the makers of these apps almost always provide a Mac and Linux version.  Microsoft has passed a dangerous tipping point where it is now like Apple in the early 90's -- fighting to attract developers who will provide killer, platform-specific apps.  We all laughed as Ballmer screamed, ""Developers, developers, developers!""  However, he's all too well aware of the danger Microsoft faces of losing its dominance as a platform provider.  I'd say ""lost"" as I believe they're already running on fumes, but they still control a huge portion of the desktop market.  They should be worrying that developers won't develop anything at all which relies on their APIs and forgo the overly ambitious goal of buying developers' use of Metro.

4098882,comment,4094671,4098642,2,0,smsm42,,,"""I never said ESR criticized RMS because of the reasons, I mentioned.""<p>Then why you mentioned those things in comment which discusses ESR's critique of RMS? Just because you had a random thought and had to express it before you forget it, no matter the topic? And why you immediately added ""But I see ESR as a epitome of hyperbole, bad mouthing, hating people because of their belief, faith and their way of life. Advocating violence""?<p>Looks like is it you that is badmouthing people because of their beliefs, not ESR, and I also notice a lot of the same un-loving feeling in your responses that you attribute to ESR. I will ignore the attempt to derail the discussion and change topic to Iraq and Muslims, however, since it is completely offtopic (and again, contains multiple false statements). I just will notice that ""advocating violence"" in context of political discussion and political critique and meaning by it supporting actions (however they may seem wrong to you) of legitimate democratic government in totally unrelated case is extremely disingenuous.<p>You proceed to declare utter baloney and try to assign this baloney as if ESR ever said it, which also is obviously false and I wonder how you can expect such cheap rhetorical trick to convince anybody.<p>I think everybody here knows how ESR has made his name, and it has absolutely nothing to do with ""bashing/thrashing/badmouthing people"". Again, why you expect this obviously false statement to sound convincing to the informed audience is a mystery to me. However, (lack of) your personal respect to ESR is not important, as points he makes do not become less valid because you personally disrespect him.<p>The most sad part of your comment is however the last link. And the most sad part of this link is that incoherent drivel by some anonymous internet trolls which consists completely of ""bashing, trashing and badmouthing"", is presented as ""Rational Wiki"". Sad and deeply ironic.",1339477383

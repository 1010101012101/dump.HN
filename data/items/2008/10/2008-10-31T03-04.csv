In any case, and with my melodramatic invocation of ""love"" notwithstanding, it's perverse not to recognize that this is no ordinary election, regardless of which candidate you favor.<p>(b) I didn't say anything about my views on the election, just that I think it's historic.  That goes even for libertarians; though I agree spending will be out of control no matter who wins, the president affects much more than the Federal budget.  And an election in the midst of two wars and a global financial crisis with the country's first black presidential candidate is historic no matter how you slice it.<p>(c) I'm an anarcho-capitalist (terrible term) in the David Friedman tradition.  Put that in your libertarian pipe and smoke it.  ;-)",1225425468

So it looks like a good idea with a lot of potential... beyond that I have not yet tried it myself, but I intend to.",1225425202

I'd make sure the front page on the alexa top 100 works flawlessly<p>- I think you need to highlight what you're about to snip when you're in ""snip mode""<p>Besides that, great work: When can I subscribe to other people's snips?",1225425195
349623,comment,349412,349511,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"This isn't a problem of democracy. It is far more general than that: it's a problem with <i>humans</i>. It persists even on the small scale -- in an oligarchy, and even in a monarchy or a dictatorship. Indeed, it might be an even <i>worse</i> in a dictatorship, because when the dictator decides to prefer an intuitive falsehood to a counterintuitive truth, there's no effective way to argue.<p>The answer to this problem, at every scale, is marketing. That's not what a roomful of rationalists wants to hear, of course, but it is the correct answer: Although it is wise to support proposals that are backed up by statistics (because those are the ones that are likely to work!) you also need a sales pitch. You must get people to associate the proposals with mom and apple pie, or with sexy people, or with Progress. Or you must convince them to follow the herd.",1225425008

349620,comment,349391,349475,0,0,gleb,,,"193 series are normal undergrad courses.  None of them were required (and probably still are not) for a CS degree, but they are an acceptable choice, along with many others.  I think I took u (Unix programming), d (C++) and i (Internet programming) back in the day.  193 series is explicitly industry oriented, but the whole point of Stanford CS education is to get the practical experience at the same time you learn the fundamentals.  The two are complimentary.",1225424582

349613,comment,348683,349540,0,0,ilamont,,,"In Taiwan 10 years ago, they had checks, but instead of signatures they used ""chops"" -- an ancient Chinese identity system based on small square stamps with the characters for your name carved in them. The ink is red. The system is thousands of years old, but was still used in an advanced Asian democracy for checks, receipts, and practically anywhere else you might use a signature (except for passports). I even had one (made out of metal, I still have it lying around somewhere) even though it was based on a Chinese name I made up in Mandarin class. I mostly used it for accepting registered mail and ""signing"" some official documents, but for other types of transactions they had foreigners use their real names and scrawled signatures.<p>They're still used there, google chop stamp taiwan and you'll get a bunch of results.<p>And yes, chops can be forged, and when I was there, there were many criminal cases involving forged or stolen chops.",1225423866

Instead, we're all put on the spot to make valid contributions. This is great, however, there isn't really a forum for users to dispute the lack of merit when downmodding occurs. As far as I'm aware, no web community has that sort of democratic judicial arena for disputes, and it would be nice. Something to think about...",1194195559

(For some reason I have a picture of sharks with laser beams)<p>Ray-tracing is a nice, simple problem domain -- enough to be complicated, but not too complicated.",1194195549

When each task needs access to the entire volume of data, Stackless gets REALLY slow.  I didn't look through the Stackless internals the way I looked into Erlang, but the slowdown was undeniable.<p>Again, for massive datasets, accessed by many cores over a massive number of threads, it needs a little more development.<p>TEST ALGORITHM:<p>Standard Volume ray casting.  Each pixel processed separately.  Ray casted through volume with alpha based early ray termination.",1194194543

I remember couple months ago where I heard and read awful things from employees and ex-employees that works/worked there. <p>Picture this: they'll give you a pager so they can page you at 3 AM in the morning to fix bugs. The development culture is more like patch-n-release without thinking the long-term design. <p>No wonder Steve Yegge bolted to Google (and then praise Google for having ""Clean Code Base"")\n",1194193822

I think VB was (is? ) considered an atrocious language because the average user of VB was, rightly or wrongly,  seen to be a ""mord"" who knew next to nothing of programming and wanted to drag and drop and click his way to project success.",1194192321

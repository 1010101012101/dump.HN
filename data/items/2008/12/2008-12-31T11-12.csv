On the iPhone and iPod, the dimensions you are working with scale 1:1 to pixels, but that you should keep in mind the scale will be different with future devices.<p>So all apps will scale automatically to bigger screens. And it seems that they planned from the start that bigger screens would come along.",1230724716
415382,comment,414745,414745,0,0,cchooper,,,"Total nonsense. I'm no relational-junkie, but I know a bad argument when I see one.<p>Firstly, the author can't decide whether relations are an abstraction or not. At points he seems to be preferring graphs to relations because graphs are abstract and relations aren't (""the anti-abstraction argument rears its head in the RDBMS vs graph database debate""). At other points, he admits that relations are also abstractions, but argues that graphs are more suited to the data we actually use. Seeing as relations are just as abstract as graphs, we can ignore all the stuff about abstractions being a good idea. Yes, we know; that's why we use relations.<p>Secondly, despite this being a post about abstraction, he doesn't distinguish between a physical implementation and a logical representation. Yes, a SQL database can store graphs inefficiently, but that's a problem of how the relations are physically stored, not a problem with relations themselves. You can store a self-joining relation just like a graph, and optimise it for graph-like queries. That's the beauty of <i>abstraction!</i><p>Thirdly, he claims that graphs are better when the structure of your system will change frequently. There's no argument for this, it's just a <i>non sequitur</i> he drops in at the end. It's true that most RDBMSs are very static in nature, but that's because they have been designed reap the rewards of static typing. They don't have the be that way, and I can't see that graphs give you any benefit here.<p>Fourtly, he claims that 'you want an abstraction that reflects how you really think about the data and not some jury-rigged representational model continuously intruding itself into your thought process.' True, but graphs are just as much a jury-rigged representational model as relations. Almost every system needs to store data about users, but users are not graphs (nor are they relations. Don't confuse your data model with reality!)<p>A database is something we build abstractions on top of. These could be graph abstractions, or object-oriented abstractions (ORMs) or whatever. A database does not dictate the abstractions you use, it simply provides an abstraction for data storage. Such an abstraction should be chosen because it can store all the different kinds of data you need, and provide constraints that prevent the data from becoming incoherent. These are the important considerations, and they aren't even mentioned.",1230724602

415379,comment,415194,415194,0,0,andyking,,,"I'm probably about as ""un-HN"" as you can get.<p>I live in a small industrial northern English city, about 10,000 miles from the buzz of Silicon Valley both physically and metaphorically.<p>I don't know how to code except a bit of really basic stuff, I don't have an education from a top university, I don't own a laptop or an iPhone or even my own home PC.<p>I don't work at a company that makes mashups out of widgets using the Google and Twitter APIs then turns them into Facebook apps.<p>But I still work in a startup, even though it's not in the web field. We're a new regional digital radio station on a platform called DAB. I love the startup atmosphere; it's so much more rewarding to come in every day and get stuck into building this thing up. It's not a web app, but it is a blank canvas for ideas and development-- we really want to do things differently to any radio station that's gone before and put to death the adage that ""there are no new ideas in radio"".<p>Personally, I take an interest in the way in which radio's using new web technologies like Twitter to have a two-way conversation with listeners and turn them into participants. I'm interested in the social news model and how it could be adapted for our medium. I want to give new life to a medium that's condemned as dying on a regular basis. We're really not ""big bad old media"", you know.<p>Some of the technical stuff on here goes way over my head, but the quality of submissions and discourse is far better than other social-news sites I could mention. I'd rather have a site that's a bit above my technical level than one that's full of conjecture about Apple laptops or pictures of cats.",1230724188

If you're CEO, COO, etc, it's harder to say during a negotiation ""I've got to check with so-and-so and I'll get back to you"" to cool things down.

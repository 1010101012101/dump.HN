Hell, I've ever had multiple people contribute designs, graphics and JS to the site wanting nothing in return.<p>It's been running less than a month in beta and has had 0 public advertising (this being the very first time) and has 150 active players purely from word-of-mouth.  Admittedly its not making any worthwhile money currently despite me putting hours and hours of work into it but its been great fun and a great learning experience so its worth it never the less - so long as it breaks even I'm happy.  - <a href=""http://islandor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://islandor.com</a>",1254873588

It is impossible that unittesting is faster and better in every possible software for every possible hardware in every possible situation in this universe and time, just plain impossible.<p>Certainly, it will make you faster in a lot of cases (and a lot of regular buiseness-programming is among these cases) but there are certainly cases where it is wrong. Think of a code emitter in a compiler, or handcrafted assembler for some micro controller, or especially a problem where you just know the solution, and it is simple. In these cases, it just is faster to just hack down the solution.",1254873397

865671,comment,865306,865306,0,0,mrshoe,,,"There's a good reason most Ruby and Python projects don't rely heavily on system calls: portability. If you care at all about portability, it's just easier to not hit the system calls directly, otherwise you'll have to detect host OS and make sure you're using the system calls properly.<p>If threads are ""out"", then pre-fork is <i>way out</i>. Just look at the history of the Apache project. I realize this all happened before the RoR era, but Apache used to use a pre-fork MPM almost exclusively. In more recent years it has added the threaded MPM and the async MPM. They have also put in the work I mentioned above to achieve cross-platform compatibility.<p>I'm just using Apache as an example here; I'm not suggesting that we should all use Apache. It's just funny to me to see a post that basically says, ""All the stuff we've been doing for the last 5 years is <i>out</i>. We should be doing the same stuff they were doing <i>15 years</i> ago, but in Ruby this time around instead of C.""<p>Maybe software trends are like music trends?

865669,comment,864333,865010,0,0,rg,,,"More recently, there was a writeup about me in the New Yorker.  Just before publication, I got a similar call from a ""fact-checker"".  The checking was detailed, and (as for jwecker) focused on hard-to-verify matters.  I asked the fact-checker about the process, and she said that the job had gotten much easier, since they could now check most facts using the web.<p>Think of how difficult the New Yorker's fact checking was before the web!  The process of fact-checking goes back to the early days of the New Yorker under editor Harold Ross.  James Thurber wrote (in ""The Years With Ross"") of ""Ross's later intense dedication to precision.  He studied the New York Telephone Company's system of verifying names and numbers in its directories ... He found out about the Saturday Evening Post's checking department, which he said consisted of seven women who checked in turn every fact, name, and date. ... His checking department became famous, in the trade, for a precision that sometimes leaned over backward. ... Ross's checkers once informed Mencken that he couldn't have eaten dinner at a certain European restaurant he had mentioned in one of his New Yorker articles, because there wasn't any restaurant at the address he had given.  Mencken brought home a menu with him to prove that he was right, but he was pleased rather than annoyed.  'Ross has the most astute goons of any editor in the country,' he said.""",1254872866

865661,comment,865412,865479,0,0,catzaa,,,"This whole article is a straw man. While differences between intelligence of races are debatable, the way the article goes about it is contentious and extremely one sided.<p>A much more important argument is whether intelligence is immutable or not. What this article doesn’t do is look at the general intelligence factor – the correct way to measure intelligence. Attacking IQ is just a straw man – IQ isn’t the best measure of intelligence, the g-factor is. IQ tests are subject to boosting (i.e. increased performance by training).<p>The evidence that intelligence is innate is significant and mounting. The general intelligence factor is found in several studies to be immutable. It is possible to see the effects of the general intelligence factor by looking at fMRI when a person does a test. Intelligence has much more to do with physiology than anyone would like to admit.<p>It is sad that a lot of people would rather turn science into pseudo science than to acknowledge the fact. These views are subject to a very good book called “The blank slate: modern denial of human nature” (by Steven Pinker).<p>PS: James Flynn does not have any formal training in psychometrics. He is a political scientist and noted left wing New Zealand political activist. He is also author of “How to Defend Humane Ideals: <i></i>Substitutes for Objectivity<i></i>”.<p>I do not know why his views are continuously brought up when there are 100s of guys in the field that is better educated than him.

I like being happy.<p>But I don't think this addresses what I see the real shortcoming of using focus groups at all - an over-reliance on the first impressions. A good example for this is drinks. If you go into Starbucks and get a premixed drink (say, their Strawberry Creme), it tastes good for the first few sips. By the time you are getting down to the bottom of the cup you realise it is disgustingly sweet. I think what happens in that situation is that they try all these formulations on some people, but it is just a fleeting taste that they are comparing.<p>The real question for me is not how people feel about your product on the first try (as long as they don't hate it!). The question is how they feel after after they have used it for a while. It is difficult to see how measuring microsmiles gets you any traction on such a problem.",1254872551

865630,comment,863852,865488,0,0,hackerblues,,,"I think there are two aspects to this that you might not have considered.<p>1) If your contact with maths is simply reading a formula out of a book and implementing it then long variable names might be fine. If you are actually trying to do a calculation then long variable names are terrible on two fronts: firstly because they take so much longer to write out, secondly because the additional characters obscure the 'moving parts' of an equation. I'd much prefer looking at ""a(b+c) = ab + ac""  vs ""first_variable * (second_variable + third_variable) = first_variable * second_variable + first_variable * third_variable""<p>2) I don't really understand what you mean by meaningful variable names. Perhaps if you are using mathematics to model a specific thing then they make sense: eg number_of_people = number_of_males + number_of_females. However, mathematics as a discipline isn't about modeling specific situations, there is no ""mathematics for groups of people"" for instance. Instead mathematics deals with manipulating abstract ideas - do abstract ideas really have meaningful names?<p>If you do have some idea then perhaps you could explain how you would define a derivative with meaningful names? The best I can come up with is:<p>derivative(some_function(variable)) = limit small_change approaches 0 (some_function(variable + small_change) - some_function(variable)) / small_change<p>Does that really assist cognition more than the standard:<p>f'(t) = lim h->0 (f(t+h)-f(t))/h ?<p>btw, can you see from this example what I mean about the extra wordiness hiding the parts?

There's a 3mm mark though and I'm fairly certain that that trailing 0.175mm is well within your normal margin of error if you are using a ruler to begin with.<p>I really don't see what the difference between not having a mark for 1/10th of an inch and not having 1/16th of a cm either, so that issue goes both ways and I'm sure you don't suffer particularly whenever you need to calculate some awkward unit that's doesn't have a mark on an imperial ruler.<p>I agree fractions are more useful in many cases, which is why if I could relate to your previous mention of splitting a cm into eight, I would've calculated with 1/8cm fractions until I was forced to use decimals.<p>I have a ruler with 1/16th of an inch on it as well. Many rulers come with both but I've never had to use an inch for anything in my life and I'm going to try to remember asking some engineering friends if they've ever if I can remember.

The average person buys a pint of milk but somewhere someone is calculating pints from liters because the UK is nowhere near self-sufficient in food and I'm sure that includes milk, so it's not unreasonable to think that the cost of conversion does affect the average person in some small unnoticeable way.<p><i>And lastly, these are the things that make countries unique!

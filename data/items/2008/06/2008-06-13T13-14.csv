216753,comment,216614,216712,0,0,fendale,,,"This is something I can relate to very well - I work for a large company that out sources lots of work to India - some of the developers are good, some terrible (as they are everywhere) - but without fail they refuse to show you anything until its all done.  There are at least two problems with this:<p>* Often they make poor implementation decisions that as the 'designer' (I hate branding myself with that term) I don't like and know it could be done a different way, but now that X weeks of development work have been done, its too late to change it.<p>* Reviewing a big blob of code like that is a nightmare - easier if I get drip fed it feature by feature.  Also, often when reviewing code I have noticed a junior developer will use the same anti-pattern over and over again - so they have to refactor all through the code - if such an error was noticed early, it would have resulted in much less work overall.",1213365016

216740,comment,216614,216704,0,0,bsaunder,,,"I think in our domain (software), there may be some additional rational to keeping things secret.  An unpolished early revision of code  may be a much better way to judge a job applicant than a resume.  No one would consider publishing the rough draft of their resume.<p>The appropriate counter argument (IMHO), is that ""unpolished"" is different than ""poorly written"", and you generally don't want to work with managers that can't comprehend and appreciate the difference.",1213363606
216739,comment,216614,216704,0,0,pm,,,"It's a natural reaction for any creative to keep their work under wraps until it's ready, but ready is relative to the medium (and the creator).<p>Having worked professionally as an illustrator before becoming a programmer, I can confidently argue most illustrations don't look close to complete until you've laid down 95% of the paint.  If you've worked all week on an illustration, and it doesn't meet your expectations, more often than not you need to begin with a clean canvas.<p>Code, on the other hand, can be functional in as little as one line.  Functionality can be built upon that, and you can refactor code more often than not without destroying the functionality that relies upon it.  Code is an infinitely more flexible medium.<p>The impulse to shelter your work from critical eyes is powerful, but ""unsightly"" work can be altered at the drop of a hat.  Perhaps programmers need to be a little more open.",1213363516

216736,comment,216616,216644,0,0,swoodtke,,,"The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is exactly what is seems to be: a single python interpreter only allows one thread to run a one time regardless of the number of CPUs or cores available.<p>This lock is per instance of the python interpreter.  Multiple instances will have a corresponding number of locks.<p>There are a couple of ways to have python use multiple cores or CPUs.<p>The first is to run multiple python instances and have them communicate between themselves using IPC mechanisms (e.g. sockets, pipes, shared memory, etc.).  The non-standard ""processing"" module implements this very cleanly using a similar interface to the standard ""threading"" module.<p>The second is to extend Python using C and explicitly release the GIL inside the C extension.  This allows both the C extension code and the Python interpreter to run simultaneously.  However, the GIL will need to be reacquired before the C extension can resume any interaction with the Python interpreter.",1213363232

6919804,comment,6916062,6919146,1,0,MichaelGG,,,"Thank you for the explanation. I can understand the logic.<p>In F#, adding a field requires &quot;field : type&quot;. If I don&#x27;t care about type checking, I can just add &quot;Props : dict<string, object>&quot; and go to town. Or I can opt-in to the dynamic features and just do &quot;foo?bar <- baz&quot;. When I change types around, things either just work due to type inference, or the compiler helpfully points out every place that&#x27;d be a runtime error. I&#x27;ve never felt this slows me down. I feel the type checking and autocomplete is worth the tiny amount that specifying a record takes. (I&#x27;ve spent days finding minor issues in JavaScript, stuff that&#x27;d instantly be caught by a type checker.)<p>Databases make it a more cumbersome, and it takes more than one line to start using a new field. I totally sympathize with the flexibility issue there. Even with a document type, most syntax I&#x27;ve seen doesn&#x27;t have truly first-class querying support (not as easy a column, anyways). And it feels ugly to have some fields defined in schema, and some in a document. But that seems like a minor tooling issue -- there&#x27;s no fundamental reason SQL can&#x27;t let me do &quot;WHERE x.SomeDoc.SomeField.OtherField > 5&quot; (perhaps some minor scope resolution issues to ensure I&#x27;m not referring to some other multi-part name).",1387259996

6919795,comment,6919658,6919672,7,0,Brakenshire,,,"You may well be right, but nevertheless, where medical care can be automated, it should be. Because otherwise medical care never gets more affordable. The economy doubles in size, wages double in the general economy, and ... doctors wages double. As long as we consider medicine an elite profession (so that we don&#x27;t train an overabundance of doctors and drive the wages down, which most of us wouldn&#x27;t want to do) employing medical staff will always cost some approximately fixed multiple of the median hourly wage. And medical care is and has always been too expensive to provide proper care for the entire population. If, for instance, we can automate doctors taking blood pressure readings, by giving patients their own sensor, or automate the drawn out process of step-by-step diagnosis by driving down blood cost prices so that 50%, 5% and 1% diagnoses can be explored simultaneously, or have automated machines which allow frail, elderly patients to bathe without needing a nurse, then we can really start to improve care, and decrease cost (which, in any case, will simply be reallocated to dealing with other ailments). Doctors lose nothing, but, step-by-step, the general population gains immeasurably.",1387259842

Or you wouldn&#x27;t have cited it?) is a steaming pile of bullshit. The workers obviously already net the owners more than $15 an hour (or $35, cited later), since the owners are <i>making money</i>.<p>McDonald&#x27;s made $5.5 billion <i>profit</i> last year and employs 1.8 million people (both numbers according to Wikipedia). Assume all of those people make $7.50 an hour and we want to double it to $15 an hour, and that they all work 40 hours a week (overly generous, but still). That&#x27;s a per-person raise of $15,600/year. Times 1.8 million people, that means an additional ~$28.1 million per year.<p>So McDonald&#x27;s would only make $5.472 billion instead. Bring me the briny tears of these wounded wealthy that I might make them soup and soothe their ills.<p>> that means your franchise has to run on a razor thin margin.<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<p>> the only way you can generate enough revenue per hour to cover that $35 or more in cost per employee is to raise prices.<p>Or to subtract a completely minuscule amount out of your profits in order to not be an absolute dickhole to your fellow humans.",1387259395

He&#x27;s going to call his wholesaler and say &quot;yeah sometime over the weekend, someone made a call from somewhere and something didn&#x27;t work right&quot;. If the wholesaler is lucky and can comb through data, they might find the call in question. Sometimes the answer is &quot;uh, you hung up&quot; or &quot;...yeah, so you got a <i>busy</i> tone&quot;. Most of the time, if you can actually find a problem, you forward it on to the offending carriers, and they repeat the search and forward it until it hits a real network. The answer to the end-user is mostly &quot;Sorry about that, we&#x27;ve made some routing updates.&quot; and hopefully they won&#x27;t experience the issue again. If the end-user repeatedly has issues, it&#x27;s probably a question of their line not having proper QoS, or something else their local PBX guy needs to sort out.<p>The &quot;antiquated and terrible old equipment&quot; is actually the least likely to cause issues.

I&#x27;ve tested nearly a dozen systems and networks, and in every case never had to spend more than a day getting root. (I&#x27;m sure there are decently designed ones, but that&#x27;s not the common case.)<p>I had the CTO of one of the major switch vendors tell me that &quot;buffer overflows aren&#x27;t a problem, unless maybe the network is very fast&quot;. This is a company that markets an edge device with security being one of the main bullet points.<p>Not to mention, I&#x27;m willing to bet in many datacenters, you could literally just walk in and take disks out of machines. If they&#x27;ve got RAID and no alarming on RAID (not too uncommon) no one will even notice. Sure, some places have solid cages or require escorts. But a lot of colo space is relatively unmonitored and so long you look like you belong there and get past perimeter security (as easy as renting 1U in the same place, often) you&#x27;re totally in.<p>And the sad part? To my knowledge, these attacks aren&#x27;t that widespread. Why? Because there&#x27;s even lower-hanging fruit that&#x27;s more lucrative to hackers.<p>Anyways, to your point: How would this access control work? How are you going to verify a CSR actually got a call from a specific customer? How much effort are you going to put in verifying that data? This is an industry where tons of money is charged and moved around based purely on emails received, with zero verification. Also remember that full wiretap capabilities are a federal requirement (CALEA). So somewhere, they&#x27;ll have a system that can turn on lawful intercept. That avenue is probably ripe for abuse.<p>You&#x27;re right in your overall sentiment. The FCC and federal government should enact privacy laws and force companies to internalize this externality.

I look through the data segment, and I see a AD DE in there (yay Intel byte reversal!).<p>I check through the code a bit, and even though it looks like the data segment is being initialized properly, it&#x27;s still reading from the Program Segment Prefix. So, I find the Wikipedia article on the PSP and see that address 05h in the PSP has a cross-segment jump to CP/M compatibility code.<p>But, there&#x27;s nothing at address DEAD (at least, nothing sensible). So I go searching through the DOSBox code for that string, and I find these lines:<p><pre><code>    // far call to interrupt 0x21 - faked for bill & ted\n    // lets hope nobody really uses this address\n    sSave(sPSP,cpm_entry,RealMake(0xDEAD,0xFFFF));\n</code></pre>\nAs it turns out, because DOSBox doesn&#x27;t implement CP/M compatibility, they simply made it jump to DEAD instead, just to make sure that if anyone tried running a CP/M program they would get the picture. And the assembler just happened to put the variable in the right place that the load pulled the DEAD instead of random nonsense.<p>I can only imagine the problems that can manifest when you&#x27;re dealing directly with hardware, and don&#x27;t have access to commented source code.",1387258579

Again according to his book, he was also a major voice against the use of enhanced interrogation techniques and had the chops to back it up. The book states that he was one of the most effective interrogators of captured Al Qaeda suspects and his method essentially boiled down to serving them tea and debating the Quran with them in Arabic.<p>For a general idea of what the book goes into, you can see Soufan&#x27;s profile in the New Yorker: <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/07/10/060710fa_fact_wright?currentPage=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/07/10/060710fa_fact_wr...</a>.

I&#x27;ve initiated contact in a bunch of cases (mostly situations where the product is a public SaaS or already well-liked) and in others, evaluating a product stems from of a conversation at a meetup or conf.<p>IMO, the best thing anyone can do is make the product discoverable. If it has competitors, write blog posts and clear feature comparisons (they don&#x27;t all have to be positive, either). If performance matters to whatever it is, write objective benchmarks and discuss performance aspects/tradeoffs. If it is something with an API, try to ensure there are a variety of platforms supported. This stuff is all good-to-have anyway, but many companies might not realize that people from large companies are browsing their sites and leaving unsatisfied.<p>I think developer-evangelist roles actually play a big part in this. Having someone set up real-world use cases and blog about them or post code somewhere can really help a customer out who just wants to try something but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time doing it.<p>If the product is private, maybe have an easy way to generate an expiring VM image with some kind of demo setup so that you can quickly send it to leads.

Per-seat licenses usually involve more effort. Purchasing professionals are looking to mitigate risk.

The FDA does not review – nor does it have the authority to regulate – what goes into cosmetics before they are marketed for salon use and consumer use. In fact, 89 percent of all ingredients in cosmetics have not been evaluated for safety by any publicly accountable institution.</i><p><i>Ironically, most consumers believe the U.S. government regulates the cosmetics industry the same way it regulates food and drugs sold in this country to make sure they&#x27;re safe. The truth is, no one&#x27;s minding the store when it comes to shampoo, skin moisturizers, baby products, lipstick or any other personal care product.</i><p><i>The FDA’s own Web site explains its limitations:</i><p><pre><code>    “FDA&#x27;s legal authority over cosmetics is different from other products regulated by the agency .... Cosmetic products and ingredients are not subject to FDA premarket approval authority, with the exception of color additives.”\n</code></pre>\n<i>The emerging evidence on the body burdens of chemicals in the American people, as well as the new science on how small exposures to these chemicals can add up to harm, suggest that there is no health-based rationale for the difference in regulatory powers between the different FDA divisions.</i><p>Here&#x27;s a link about formaldehyde in hair straighteners:<p><a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=us-government-has-little-authority-to-stop-unsafe-cosmetics\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=us-governme...</a><p><i>Josimov began to realize it was her life that was changing.

30601,comment,30544,30545,0,0,zach,,,"We actually went to a good old-fashioned business insurance agent.  We got a reference from someone who was happy with theirs.<p>Me and my founder have a Blue Cross HSA plan that costs around $150-$200 per month for a single employee.  It's $200 if you want the HSA-minimum $1500 per year deductible.  After the deductible is met, PPO network expenses are entirely paid by the plan, and before they're met you get PPO discounts.  I recommend it.<p>We have the advantage of being in California, an extremely favorable environment for small businesses (2-50 employees) to get group health plans in.  Couple things worth pointing out about our situation:<p>- It's an honest-to-goodness group plan, not an individual plan.  Individuals have health coverage at the pleasure of the insurer.  Those lovely stories about insurers (like Blue Cross) cancelling policies retroactively happen to people with individual plans.<p>- In California, insurers can't refuse to insure a small business based on employees' health or medical history.  Do you know how difficult it can be to get individual insurance with less-than-average health, much less an actual medical condition?  Basically, forget it.  Small businesses in CA have no such problem.  Even though we're healthy, it lets us actually rely on our health insurance.<p>- Also in California, insurers are limited to charging no more than 10 percent more than an index of what they charge large businesses, based on the employees' health.  It's a great deal for small businesses.  And again, it makes things very predictable even in a worst-case scenario.<p>- As a C corporation, we can deduct the premiums we pay as expenses.  Some, especially S corps and LLCs, may not be able to -- in any case, consult your tax advisor.<p>- We can hire someone tomorrow and offer a health plan that we don't have to be ashamed of, and it's flexible.  If we need to share costs, we can pay only half or most of it and deduct the rest.  If we can afford to offer a premium health plan, we simply pay the premiums and fund their HSA every month.",1182801530

I know this ""holy crap"" feeling. --Ultimately, every company has competition --Here's my take: what's good about competition is knowing there are customers demanding the product or service I offer.

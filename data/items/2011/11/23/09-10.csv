3269468,comment,3268045,3268045,3,0,aristedes,,,"Where to start with this blog post? It appears that the author has seen a couple of private emails and thinks he knows all about the internal workings of the Apache Foundation. He is wrong on so many counts.<p>His entire dislike of the Apache Foundation appears to be predicated on the fact that the organisation did not force every project to move to this blogger's favourite version control tool. Making a change as large as this requires many different things, but in particular:<p>1. Community change. How committers interact with each other when there are lots of forks is quite different to the current situation. That suits some projects and not others. Not every project at Apache will benefit. Some will. All who change will need to think long and hard about release processes, merging strategies and much more. Git encourages the idea that every commit or fork is completely equal to every other fork or commit. The Apache Foundation is built on the concept of meritocracy: commit rights are given in response to demonstrated skill. This is not an intractible problem with git, but new challenges need to be solved.<p>2. Legal change. Right now there is a simple process for signing off intellectual property for contributions which were merged from external contributors (who have not signed a release). That changes with git and becomes more complex. There are solutions, but they require careful planning.<p>3. Infrastructure. Hosting a large git repository with the level of downtime acceptable to Apache isn't something you do quickly. That needs planning and maintenance.<p>4. Toolsets. Lots of things in Apache are tied into subversion. From mailing list commit hooks to build servers and much more. Changing those things takes work.<p>5. Splitting the community. Right now the entire organisation's intellectual property is held in a single repository. Everyone knows where everything is to be found. Changing this simplicity requires a very good reason.<p>So what do we have now? A blogger who (it appears) doesn't actually contribute code to any Apache project. Telling other people how to run their organisation (which is wildly successful). And that they should change to this blogger's favourite new tool (they should have done it in 2008!) or face irrelevance.<p>If Apache moved every project to github tomorrow would that satisfy this blogger? More importantly, would that have caused this guy to commit high quality code toward one of the Apache projects? Or is he just blowing a lot of hot air about something he knows little?<p>And what brought on this great complaint? That the Apache Foundation is currently underway with trials for one project to see how git would succeed for their workflow. And to then evaluate its suitability for other projects across Apache.<p>Apache is not Github. That is, Apache is much more than a website, a couple of tools and a repository of code of random quality.<p>Disclaimer: I am an Apache member, but not speaking on behalf of Apache",1322042278

3269466,comment,3268045,3268284,7,0,kahawe,,,"Spot on, excellent points and I could not help but wonder about the article... most people would consider ""apache"" to be synonymous for the httpd and not the ASF, so the headline is clearly fishing.<p>Then, OP argues ASF's processes are broken and a github project with one maintainer is so much easier... you really have to consider the scale of the average sourceforge (back in the day) project vs. apache even back then - and they have only grown from there, so no wonder a project hosted on github now is more ""fun"" to contribute to and work with because processes are probably pretty much non-existent and communication-paths and hierarchies are pretty much flat. The same goes for working at a small start-up vs. working at HugeFatCat Inc.<p>But one thing I cannot stand: arguing git over subversion. Yes both are great revision control systems but they are just meant for different applications. Where I am working, I would take subversion over git any day if all I really want is an absolutely sure-fire way of having a simple and easy to use central repository. I am in the unfortunate position to having met and working with quite a few people (programmers non-the-less) who have a hard time coping with basic CVS/SVN update-commit cycles - with git and mercurial offering you the option to commit but to your local changes first before actually committing your changes to the repository you checked out from (or another repository or...), this would have literally created havoc and confusion for my small team here... I know them, yes it sounds ridiculous, but I know I have saved myself a hell of a lot of trouble and headache. SVN is an absolutely perfect tool for the job if you do not need the de-centralization, on-the-go-commits and all the possibilities of creating custom processes in git with all its flexibility and features and options. SVN works just fine for what it is.<p>git and mercurial are not better,newer,shinier substitutes but different beasts altogether. (great, shiny, powerful and useful none-the-less) So could be please just let them peacefully co-exist and be thankful someone made them for us to make our lives easier?",1322042196

3269437,comment,3269283,3269283,27,0,pyrmont,,,"(I'm an Australian lawyer and will use 'trade mark' as my preferred spelling.)<p>The headline of this link is misleading. An action doesn't 'violate a trade mark'. An action can infringe the rights that a trade mark owner has (the scope of those rights will be dependent on the location in which the right has been granted and where the action takes place). In common law countries, trade mark rights can refer to statutory rights (which are granted in accordance with a piece of legislation and typically require registration with a government office) and common law rights.<p>This document is Adobe's guidelines for use of its trade marks. Adobe is saying that, if you follow the guidelines in these documents, then you can be sure that you have not infringed any of Adobe's rights in its trade marks (or at least that Adobe won't sue you alleging that you have).<p>Whether a failure to follow these guidelines constitutes trade mark infringement is a separate matter. Generally speaking, a trade mark owner has the right to use a trade mark exclusively in the course of trade in respect of a class of products. What does it mean to use a trade mark in the course of trade? This means, for instance, using a particular word or phrase to identify your product. Consumers will then use your trade mark to identify your product in the course of trade (eg. 'Could I please buy a copy of Photoshop?'). An obvious rationale for trade mark rights is to protect consumers from unscrupulous merchants who might call their product Photoshop in order to take advantage of the goodwill Adobe has built up in its product.<p>However, not every use of a term is in the course of trade. It is not in the course of trade for me to write a Wikipedia article about Photoshop. I would argue it is also not in the course of trade to use photoshop as a verb to refer to the act of digital manipulating an image (such as by using the Photoshop product).<p>Why does Adobe want to prevent people from doing this? As others have pointed out, if a trade mark falls into common usage, a trade mark owner can lose the ability to register it as a trade mark (trade marks are usually registered for a period of time and must be renewed after that period) and so lose, at the very least, the statutory rights associated with that registration. This then enables competitors to use that term in their products. Good examples of trade marks that have fallen into common usage are elevator, xerox and hoover. Obviously Adobe spends a great deal of money developing and marketing the Photoshop brand. They do not want to see it become a generic term that competitors can use.<p>That said, usually both trade mark owners and their competitors have little interest in a term becoming generic. You don't see Microsoft going around saying that you should 'google' something. While a trade mark falling into common usage can be a bad thing from an intellectual property perspective, it can of course be a good thing from a marketing perspective. This is why the only people like to cause a trade mark to fall into common usage is the general public (and possibly journalists). So, people like Adobe pay lawyers to draft up these kind of documents to help make sure that doesn't happen.<p>While I practice law, I must give one of those annoying disclaimers that are part of the reason people hate us: I am not your lawyer and the above should not be treated as legal advice. If you are concerned as to whether you are infringing a trade mark, I recommend speaking to a lawyer in your local area.",1322041346

Because you have to play the game of corporate politics if you want any chance of success, and avoid being labeled as difficult and abrasive.<p>As long as the large majority of job postings and companies are looking for <i>obedient workers</i> of a certain skill, most people will want an education to become an obedient worker of a certain skill.

4854803,comment,4853898,4854412,1,0,jlgreco,,,"It is obviously a hard thing to quantify, but relative pain of branching and merging is apparent through the different version control styles commonly advocated/actually seen for both systems.  As a simple example, while this (<a href=""http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a>) is certainly possible in SVN, I have never actually seen an SVN shop consistently doing that.  To the extent that any I have seen do follow that model, they do so essentially at gunpoint, not because it is a pleasant thing to do.  On the other hand that sort of thing is exceedingly simple and <i>pleasant</i> in git.  As a consequence, in the real world, people are much more willing to employ both with git without any hesitation at all.<p>Also poorly quantifiable is the sense of fear or anticipation that courses through your veins when you hear the phrase, in an SVN shop, <i>""Hey, I've got a feature branch I want to merge in.""</i>",1354301966

4854784,comment,4853864,4854358,17,0,sophacles,,,"When I get involved with projects, I have a lot of potential up front to contribute, and try to do so. Some problems are best handled by those unfamiliar with the project. Examples:<p>* Documentation fixes - clarifications of parts you find confusing, inconsistencies with current behavior, etc.<p>* Convention fixes - are most binary checks names IsFoo() but one is named Foo_exists() ? do a quick refactor patch for it. Is one Exception named oddly, or have an unclear message? Patch is quick.<p>* Examples - does an example highlighting something you're confused about exist? Once you figure it out, whip up an example and contribute. Others are also confused about it - I promise.<p>* Code commenting - Do the comments contradict the code? Is there something in the code that confuses you? Once you figure it out, fix it and submit.<p>These are all things that are actually EASIER for newcomers to a project to do - once the quirk has been internalized by a dev, they frequently don't notice it anymore. Particularly with documentation and commenting stuff.<p>It is harder to do this with giant/super popular projects, but medium and smaller projects can always use this sort of support. For example - I decided to checkout Marionette a couple weeks ago. I was reading the docs and browsing the code to see how something was implemented, and noticed the docs and the code were not in sync. I created and submitted a patch within hours of first learning of the project. This was also a work day, so most of those hours were not spent on anything at all related. The patch was accepted - not a big deal thing, but it was nice to contribute, and it may save someone else half an hour of figuring out what was happening. The dev who merged it actually commented that he didn't realize the docs were out of date - because he knows the code.<p>Point being, little contributions like this abound. As a project owner, I don't care when contributions are major deals or little tweaks or documentation helpers. I'm just happy when someone contributes, it makes me feel that my project is worth the effort. Which I think may be the point of the idea anyway.",1354301744

LuaJIT 2 uses direct threading (not new at all), register-based bytecode (relatively new), and manually optimised register assignment (perhaps new).  AFAICT, the key innovations are that he did not use Lua 5.1's register-based bytecode format, but simplified it even further so it can be decoded efficiently on x86.  The second key component is that he pre-decodes the following instruction in order to take advantage of out-of-order execution.  This technique also required fixing some register's roles.<p>Don't get me wrong, I think LuaJIT2's interpreter is great, but interpreters before LuaJIT2 weren't complete crap, either.

I'm reminded of this quote by Dave Hickey from Air Guitar:<p>""Since there is no absolute authority in the art world, or in the economic world either, we may presume that for every opinion, there is a contrary one. Thus, the social value of a work of art, or an art critic, or a theory, or an institution must be distinguished from its social virtue, since bad reviews, stupid acquisitions, and theoretical attacks, even as they question the social virtue of an object or investment, must necessarily invest it with social value. The raw investment of attention, positive or negative, qualifies certain works of art as players in the discourse. So, even though it may appear to you that nearly everyone hates Jeff Koons work, the critical point is that people take the time and effort to hate it, publicly and at length, and this investment of attention effectively endows Koons work with more importance than the work of those artists whose work we like, but not enough to get excited about.""<p>I mean, give it time or ignore it, or both. All museums make questionable purchases. Being in the permanent collection is certainly a boon, but it won't change how people fundamentally feel about the art in a few generations. Maybe it'll remain successful, maybe it won't, but it certainly captures <i>something</i> which i guess is reason enough to acquire it.",1354300736

They aren't an analytics provider. They provide a generic backend API that you can use with your apps to store and fetch whatever data you desire. For the number of user's you're probably working with, and the number of events you'll want to log, you will most likely stay under their 1,000,000 free requests per month (and if you don't, the $200/mo expense will probably be acceptable to you given your app's monthly revenue).<p>>If Apple provided a reliable way to determine who had already paid, I would have just automatically disabled ads for people who had paid.<p>Two things here: first, you should have only shown the adds to new users. That would have been the safest play to avoid backlash from existing users. Second, this is why it's a great idea to track ""firstLaunchDate"" in the NSUserDefaults in 1.0 versions of your future apps. With that single piece of information you would have been able to target exactly who sees the adds and who doesn't.<p>Edit: I wanted to add I think you <i>might</i> be making a mistake backing down at this point. It seems that all of the problems you mention in this post relate to some small (yet vocal) percentage of your existing users being upset with the recent changes. That's a temporary problem, and probably not that big of a deal at this point since you've already absorbed the majority of the backlash you're going to get.

The more someone is able to think critically for oneself, the least they like being controlled.<p>The fact that a large portion of today's content is created solely for the purpose of making profits certainly doesn't help.

4854520,comment,4850428,4853625,2,0,pbiggar,,,"> How is its interpreter substantially different or more impressive than previous interpreters written in assembly language?<p>Traditionally, there were two implementation strategies: compilers and interpreters. JITs didnt become mainstream until Sun bought Hotspot and put it into the 2nd version of Java.<p>So you had to choose between compilers and interpreters. Compilers led to optimization, fast object code, but were complex to implement (especially multiplatform). Interpreters were simple to implement, very portable, but were very very slow.<p>Obviously there is more to both, but until recently, basically this is how people thought about language implementation. Considerations like a REPL, slow compilation speed, ease of prototyping, etc, were a complete side show (perhaps people cared, but you'd rarely see it discussed).<p>When all of the dynamic languages were implemented, they all used interpreters, written in C. They all used a simple dispatch loop to opcode implementation, and let the C compiler do the heavy lifting. All the research into fast compilers (the David Gregg/Anton Ertl stuff for example), looked at instruction set (registers/stack) and dispatch type. So when making interpreters fast, there were only 4 strategies:<p>- make a compiler,<p>- use better dispatch,<p>- rewrite using a register interpreter set,<p>- make a JIT.<p>Making a JIT is lunacy of course, because JITs are ridiculously hard, they're not portable. So that Pall was making a 1-man JIT (LuaJIT1) was incredible.<p>But that he made an interpreter that was as fast as a JIT was even more insane. In Trinity, all of us language/JIT/scripting language people were in one room, and when we heard about this we were just amazed. Nobody had even thought about the stuff - it was all brand new and novel in a field that barely had anything novel in decades! Until that point, basically all interpreters were one big while loop.<p>> How is its interpreter substantially different or more impressive than previous interpreters written in assembly language?<p>I wouldnt know, since I've not heard of any mainstream interpreters in assembly. I can only imagine that they were exactly the same as C interpreters: essentially a while loop with a switch statement, just written in assembly.<p>I find it amusing that you started at LuaJIT2. I would liken it to studying modern war, then wondering ""why didnt they just use drone strikes at the Somme"" :) Looking back from LuaJIT2, interpreters must seem really really primitive.",1354299235

4854506,comment,4853898,4854278,3,0,Niten,,,"I use both extensively (git for most personal projects, Mercurial at work), so I feel like chiming in here.<p>I really do think that Mercurial's user interface is easier for beginners to pick up, and more difficult to shoot oneself in the foot with.  It's the little things, like the fact that Mercurial's push and pull commands do exactly the opposite of one another, that hg clone/pull URLs are identical to what you type into a web browser to browse the repo, and the ease of dealing with Mercurial ""bare"" repositories (hg up -r null) for mirroring and backup purposes.<p>And the way Mercurial's command-line interface strongly discourages one from modifying history; it makes it harder for things to get messed up on a small team coordinating with a shared-access repo.  Yes, I know git has the reflog, but in general people seem to have <i>much</i> fewer ""OMG WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO MY BRANCH"" moments with Mercurial than with git.  That (along with mq, which provided a unique solution to our team's needs) was the major reason I chose Mercurial over git at work.  If we're going to brandish about the term ""UX"" here, then I'd say Mercurial definitely has a better ""UX"" than git.<p>But Mercurial has pain points, too.  The biggest one, in my opinion, is the way branches work: Mercurial started out with named branches, which it seems the community has recognized as a mistake, and has moved to replace with git-style branches (called ""bookmarks"" in Mercurial land).  These work better, but there are still some drawbacks: for one thing, Mercurial lacks the notion of a ""remote"", so unlike in git your local bookmarks and remote bookmarks have to share the same namespace.  This leads to counter-intuitive behavior when it comes to synchronizing bookmarks with a remote server, and often you'll find that bookmarks aren't necessarily updated when you'd expect them to be.<p>Additionally, the notion of a ""tip"" makes working with feature branches frustrating, because by default Mercurial will check out from whatever branch was pushed to most recently, rather than a de-facto standard ""master"" as in git.  Hand in hand with this complaint, by default Mercurial will want to push <i>all</i> your changesets, not just those under your current working bookmark, so you have to constantly specify e.g. ""hg push -r master"" to keep from pushing local throw-away branches.  And it's not easy to delete local throw-away branches if you decide you don't want them (the downside of Mercurials aversion toward history modification), so one generally winds up using a separately-cloned repo for temporary work, which is unfortunate in contrast with git.<p>Mercurial and git are both great, efficient, high-performance tools.  But if I had to generalize, I'd say that Mercurial is better for beginners and for ""enterprisey"" usage, whereas git, despite its interface inconsistencies, can be more powerful once you fully understand it and its data model (but only if you aren't working primarily on Windows, and don't need Mercurial Queues).",1354299080

I think the story is more complex than this.<p>Yes, to build wealth you need to press and push--no one is going to give you anything for free and pre-buyers remorse can be a bitch. But cheat? I don't know about that--it depends on your definition.<p>If cheating is maintaining borderline outrageous profit margins, then yes, it helps to do that. But if cheating is something more along the lines of getting 50% up front for a project you underbid, then holding that money hostage while you proceed to milk the project with change orders every step of the way--then yes, that's cheating (and probably illegal-ish). Plenty of people operate this way but I think it's a pretty bad way to do business--both from an economic standpoint and a how-did-you-get-to-be-such-a-terrible-person? standpoint.  And then of course there's the run-of-the-mill cheating that is enterprise software marketing departments, but if that's your worst sin in life, I think you're probably doing ok.<p>And while there are plenty of cases of crooks making out like bandits, there are just as many about pretty honest people making out like bandits as well. Compare Mike Milken and Warren Buffet for example.  Or from tech, the guy that started color vs pg. As far as what I've read about both of them, they seem like rather different personality types, but both of them seem to be doing ok financially.<p>So yes, nothing is cut and dry, and anyone that says you can't make a lot of money via semi-legal stealing is dead wrong, but I really don't think this is the only--or even the most expedient--way to get rich. Speaking personally, I prefer sitting around coming up with ways to build value for customers instead of coming up with more clever ways of fucking them.",1354298690

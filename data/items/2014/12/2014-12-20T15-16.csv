Could you explain some of the issues, perhaps some general approaches people take? Is the tooling for it any good, or is the tooling the main issue?<p>I generally prefer relational databases, and from a theory point of view they feel much nicer and have the potential to be much faster, however, one thing MongoDB has got right is the simple primitives for scaling, and having them built into the core product, something I don&#x27;t think Postgres has.<p>I think there&#x27;s a lot that Postgres (and other relational databases) can learn from MongoDB (ease of sharding perhaps?), Cassandra (consistent hashing maybe?), HyperDex, etc. And I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s much that those products can learn from the relational world as well.",1419091113

That would be a nice theoretical maximum to compare against.<p>Edit: I tested the C++ version on my 5-year-old i7, with an even older compiler (just had to modify the code to not use C++11 features), and with the max optimisation level, it produces a result of 1465ms - which is <i>pretty damn amazing</i>, considering that this is a 16-year-old compiler generating 32-bit code and the most recent CPU it had knowledge of was the Pentium Pro (P6)!

8776892,comment,8772422,8776025,0,0,jostylr,,,"Standard quantum mechanics only has the wave function. The thing you object to in Bohmian mechanics is the wave function. Both are nonlocal. You should object to both.<p>In particular, standard quantum mechanics gets results of experiments by collapsing the wave function. That is, it takes something which is universe spanning and it collapses it to something, with the collapse based on what a physicist does in a laboratory. That, of course, should seem rather absurd. To get around that, you have to add something either particle positions, a matter density, flashes, etc.  You need results to experiments in a theory. Without something (and collapse from experiments is adding the collapse mechanism + external experiments, whatever that means), you do not get results. So the theory is a complete failure.<p>Only many worlds is not non-local (it adds a matter density by integrating the wave function appropriately), but they escape it by not having results of experiments at the time that history records there were results. I think. That theory makes me a little dizzy at times.<p>Also, the hidden state of BM is not hidden. We have a basic sense that stuff has positions. That may be an illusion, but Bohmian mechanics says that we can choose a theory that does not have that be an illusion. The thing that is hidden, that is deduced from the behavior of stuff which we see, is the wave function.<p>What BM explains is why it seems that our world is particle-like and why we have singular outcomes to experiments. All done naturally. Sure, the nonlocal nature is a problem that we are still trying to understand, but so what? No one has got the full story yet and so BM is viable and gives a great intuition about QM (the standard QM (operators, collapse) is a derivable formalism, like thermodynamics from Newtonian Mechanics).",1419090827

Many people in ancient India tradition delved into nature of mind, intellect, memory, ego extensively. They considered delving into this &quot;inner world&quot; a worthy pursuit. Vedanta which literally means &quot;end of knowledge or final knowledge&quot; primarily are in the Upanishad texts. They are typically discussions between teacher and students on nature of mind, intellect, ego, meditation, samadhi etc. Very interesting but best learnt under a competent teacher. The tradition is to first experience (through meditation, silence etc.) and then understanding would dawn automatically.
The Bhagavad Gita which is said to be over 5000 years old says that &quot;wise sees inaction in action and action in inaction&quot;. Almost everyone experiences this sometimes in life. 
It also talks about the wise one being skilled in both pravritti and nivritti - which broadly means ability to act hundred percent and also the ability to totally let go at appropriate times. This is considered a precious skill.<p>There is a vast treasure house of wisdom in the Vedantic tradition. But needs a good teacher to correctly interpret it, complemented with regular meditation, reflection etc.",1419089663

8776795,comment,8776625,8776625,0,0,nullspace,,,"Want to see other replies as well - but here are some of my thoughts.<p>1. Run your query with explain - to confirm that your queries are indeed indexed[1]. There have been a couple of times where we discovered that a specific branch of a complex query was not hitting index - so discovering that was useful.<p>2. One thought on slow reads with aggregation framework and 1M+ documents is that you are bottlenecked on memory. Even though all your queries may be indexed - you may be hitting disk too often (and doing a lot of random I/O) which is expensive. Check out MMS - and specifically the page faults graph - and you will get an idea about how many times a second you hit disk. For my specific application - response time was very important - so we tried to keep our page faults close to zero. Is increasing the RAM in your instance a viable option? If so this would definitely give you some breathing room.<p>3. You should try and verify if your response is slow because the query processing time itself is high, or if it&#x27;s because you have several concurrent queries competing for system resources (CPU / memory etc). If it&#x27;s the latter - the fix is easy - just add more machines to your replicaset (balance this with adding more RAM).<p>4. Check your lock %. My guess - from your brief description - this will not be an issue for you. If this is an issue - you __may__ need to shard your system - or do 5.<p>5. I think the most scalable solution would be to rethink your data pipeline. Why do you need to apply complex aggregation queries on 1M+ documents? Can you build a processing pipeline that takes in your data - and builds &quot;prepared views&quot; for the queries you expect out of your aggregation pipeline? In my application - we used stream processing pipeline that aggregated all the messages we got - in all the different ways we needed - and inserted them into different databases (to work around the DB level locking :( ) in mongo. Each collection had exactly ONE type of query that would be executed - this would be an extremely simple query and would be indexed. This pattern is common - even outside of mongo.<p>Good luck :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/cursor.explain/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/cursor.expla...</a>",1419088728

8776776,comment,8775250,8776070,0,0,couchand,,,"My experience has been that performant code is very hard to write.  In particular, the tools that Angular provides for the most common sorts of things you&#x27;d want it to do (ng-repeat, ng-show/hide, ng-click, $on and $watch) all break down for one reason or another when trying to use them in anything but a toy application [0].<p>When I realized that ng-hide just applies CSS classes I did a huge facepalm.  Consider the example of dynamically constructing a table.  In Angular:<p><pre><code>    <tr ng-repeat=&quot;child in children&quot;>
      <td ng-show=&quot;foo(child)&quot;>Foo</td>
      <td ng-hide=&quot;foo(child)&quot;>Bar</td>
    </tr>
</code></pre>
This example runs the function foo four (!) times per digest cycle per item.  Sure, you could convolute your code to make the Angular more performant, but at the cost of clear and maintainable markup.  What&#x27;s more, this produces rows with two cells, one of them hidden with CSS, which is ripe for creating hard-to-debug issues.  The alternative in basically any other framework is written in a way and produces code execution and markup that you&#x27;d intuitively expect.<p>Angular&#x27;s directive system encourages developers to write illegal markup.  Enough said.<p>Angular&#x27;s DI system is needlessly complicated, and the basic usage breaks when minifying because it couples identifier names to string values.<p>That same issue is repeated in many different aspects of Angular: the basic, intuitive usage is (intentionally or not) broken in a production environment.  The amount of deep knowledge of the Angular framework that&#x27;s required to successfully develop apps is absurd.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/angularjs-performance-large-applications"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/angularjs-performanc...</a>",1419088373

This is especially true as the price tag goes up - when you&#x27;re selling $1m deals, it is just about always done on personal selling basis.<p>With the exception of Atlassian, most of the low/no-touch companies I&#x27;ve seen are pretty limited in scalability - I don&#x27;t know many that have reached a $100m in sales without having a traditional sales team. As another example, Mixpanel, which would seem to have a low-touch approach, is building a huge sales team. Zendesk is interesting - but I know they&#x27;ve got salespeople because we just negotiated with them.<p>I should also differentiate between those that show prices on their website or not - many show pricing - although it is often generalized. Many show pricing up to a certain level and then you have to talk to a rep - Mixpanel goes up to $24k a year and then you have to talk to a rep.<p>Would love to see more examples other than Atlassian if anyone has them.",1419087834

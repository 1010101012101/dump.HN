I would be interested in seeing both maintainer&#x27;s answer to this, too.<p>At a high level, I can see how there might have been a bit of friction in trying to implement Wagtail on top of Mezzanine. Mezzanine&#x27;s features, admin interface, and content model are fairly tightly integrated (I hope I&#x27;m not misrepresenting Mezzanine here, I think that this is an affirmative goal of the project). It provides a lot for the developer and the site admin out of the box—usable templates, basic page types, a blog, an image library. On the other hand, Wagtail core offers surprisingly little—the wagtaildemo project is a nice starting point for some basic content types, but it&#x27;s just another user of the Wagtail API.<p>For me, the killer features of Wagtail are: deep integration with ElasticSearch, a moderation based workflow, content revision tracking, document library. It&#x27;s feature list is like a love letter to institutional clients. However, that&#x27;s a lot of code that is not integral to Mezzanine, and I don&#x27;t think it fits with the maintainer&#x27;s philosophy of &quot;it&#x27;s integrated, but not a kitchen sink.&quot; [Note: I made up this quote.]<p>To both maintainers, nice work, and thanks.",1398646659

7657669,comment,7656056,7656786,2,0,csallen,,,">> <i>&quot;The claim most paleo advocates seem to be making is that you should eat food that the body is adapted to eating.&quot;</i><p>In full, their claims fall closer to the following:<p><pre><code>  P1. You should eat healthy foods.\n  P2. Foods that the body is &quot;adapted&quot; to eating are healthy.\n  P3. If paleolithic humans ate something, it means our bodies are &quot;adapted&quot; to it.\n  C. We should eat what paleolithic humans ate.\n</code></pre>\nThe problems with the above line of reasoning are numerous. While most everyone would prefer to eat healthy when possible, the word &quot;adapted&quot; is ambiguous, and the argument that it&#x27;s healthier to eat foods we&#x27;re &quot;adapted&quot; to lacks evidence and is overly ambitious.<p>It&#x27;s hard enough to examine healthiness on a food-by-food (or even an ingredient-by-ingredient) basis, so labeling broad categories of food as healthy or unhealthy is bound to be even harder.",1398646534

7657660,comment,7657251,7657403,10,0,Snail_Commando,,,"> The approach may work a while. But then I am sure some mutant gene will eventually emerge in the wild-type populations that will inhibit the synthetic kill gene.<p>> That&#x27;s how Nature works.<p>More accurately, &quot;That&#x27;s how Nature works, sometimes.&quot;<p>The statement &quot;...some mutant gene will eventually emerge ... that will inhibit [another gene]&quot; describes one subset of the set of all possible causes of future genetic expression branching from this point. There is no law (that we are yet aware of) that allows us to say conclusively that a certain genetic trait will be selected for or against with any meaningful certainty. Furthermore, we have no scientific footing on which to say &#x27;we are sure that a specific mutation will arise that will inhibit this other mutation&#x27; as decreed by Nature. In order for the claim to always be true in all arbitrary subsets of Nature, we would need to at least know: whether or not the gene <i>will</i> be selected against, specifically <i>how</i> the gene will be selected against, and nearly all nth order organism-local and population-global effects of a specific mutation or selection event. (We can play Nature in the lab and make approximations of the claim, though! Sort of.)<p>We can make statements like &quot;If the oxygen content of that atmosphere or environment increases, it is possible that many anaerobic organisms will be selected against.&quot; Or, &quot;If low hemoglobin production becomes advantageous, at some point after that, conditions x, y, and ... will likely exhibit reciprocal selective pressures.&quot;<p>Of course, we can also say things like, &quot;All species are statistically likely to go extinct.&quot; (That&#x27;s not very interesting.)<p>Essentially, we can make broad guesses about future states of genetic expression (and implied warranties and effects) under certain specific contexts. But we cannot say that a specific genetic cause and effect will occur as derived from an inherent property of Nature and a specific sub-state of the universe. As far as we know, genetics, mutation, evolution, and selection are just functions in a mostly random, iterated chaotic system that we are just beginning to comprehend.<p>We cannot say that &#x27;a particular gene will be selected against, because it is inevitable that specific genes are invariably inhibited or selected against by subsequent shifts in population genetics.&#x27; In a sense, that&#x27;s partially accurate. All species, and by extension, each gene and all genomes, <i>are</i> likely to be selected against. But not always via mutation. It&#x27;s about the same as saying that species go extinct because of x; it&#x27;s not certain to be true and may not yield any new information.<p>There is no law (that we know of) that allows us to make deterministic statements like &#x27;X% of the genome will be inhibited because of the emergence of another mutation&#x27;.<p>For all we know, a rogue asteroid might hit Earth on Tuesday during rush hour in Hong Kong. Or, that particular gene may end up surviving until the closest possible moment before the heat death of the universe. On a more fundamental level, we&#x27;d need laws that allow us to predict specific future events (with interesting and meaningful degrees of certainty). We would need to be able to identify and map the exquisitely threaded chaos woven throughout Nature before we can be reasonably certain that &#x27;a mutation will eventually arise to inhibit this other mutation.&#x27;",1398646352

Primitive actions like Move and Fire can be compounded into higher level commands like Sustain Cover Fire or Setup Ambush. These are recursively aggregated into even higher level directives like Attack Enemy Position. All commands have pre- and post-conditions, and the AI engine stitches together a sequence of commands under the current constraints (eg using Charge Hill instead of Charge Building when Attack Enemy is specified on a knoll instead of a building, you need to Setup Ambush on an incoming road if expecting enemy reinforcement).<p>At the lowest level, I had to implement detailed algorithms for pathfinding (easy, but consider different terrain, on-road, etc), line-of-sight (actually pretty hard due to time constraints and size of map) for locating best vantage points, etc. Implementing fuzzy conditions are tricky, eg the idea of &#x27;threat&#x27; where a unit knows it is outnumbered by a superior force (when is an enemy unit relevant? based on distance? what if it&#x27;s currently engaged against an allied unit? Can you get threat from one direction but not the other? what if the enemy can&#x27;t see you?)<p>The hardest part about this was actually getting the domain experts to write the heuristics using my script editor. These army guys don&#x27;t think like programmers at all! Even getting them to encode their decision process using simple If-Then-Else was an insurmountable challenge in mental gymnastics. :(<p>Still it was fun. As it turns out, it was used to train actual army commanders in a small foreign country. :)",1398644383

Some basic points should alleviate your fears. First, the mosquito they&#x27;re trying to eradicate is a non-native species. Second, said mosquito is the primary vector for Dengue fever, which infects hundreds of thousands and kills hundreds in Brazil every year. Even if this mosquito was native to South America, eradicating it would almost certainly help people.<p>It&#x27;s interesting how support for this program decreases with distance from it. If this outbreak was happening in <i>your</i> country, hurting <i>your</i> family, killing <i>your</i> friends, I doubt you&#x27;d be so loath to support GM solutions.<p>A side note:  99.9% of all species that have ever existed have gone extinct. Nature is not some carefully-balanced system. It is chaos and suffering on a scale we cannot imagine. The majority of wild animals live in a state of constant hunger, pain, and disease. Those with sufficiently complex brains live in fear of predators. Speaking of predators: We would be horrified to watch a man vivisect an antelope, but we pay to watch documentaries of lions doing the same thing.

In that case, a savvy arbitrageur might take advantage of prices while they're at their widest differential, and then wait to buy more the next day.

The government noticed that people were enjoying short-acting stimulants with only moderate harm, so it restricted everything but methamphetamine to increase the harm to punish sin. The meth ""epidemic"" is a planned social cleansing program. (The government is very much not doing this by accident. They know they won the Battle of Britain because our boys used Dexedrine and could get their eight (hours of sleep) after each mission. The Germans used methamphetamine to the extent they used anything, and we know how that turned out.)<p>This is a repeat of the mass murder and maiming campaign conducted during alcohol Prohibition. Then the government quietly added methanol to industrial ethanol. Methanol was chosen because it selectively damages certain nerves, leaving drinkers blind, gruesomely brain damaged, or dead if they were lucky.

So, seeing he had a high probability for Obama in Virginia, which turned out to be close, I concluded that one of three things was true:<p>1. Virginia was very heavily polled and there was just a ton of good and consistent data, justifying a prediction of 80%.
OR 2. Virginia had a normal amount of good and consistent data, but it was all very lopsided.
OR 3. There was an error with Nate's model or with the data.<p>Had I known that I could have easily accessed his predicted margins I could have easily seen that it was 1.  But without knowing that, I was ruling out 2 because it turned out the state was very close.<p>My point was that it's not easy to just look at Nate's map and score it against the result map. That's a very shallow and fairly uninteresting way to look at it.<p>My secondary point was that even if you understand that he had predicted some percentage chance to win in each state, it's not even easy to look at that percentage chance and score it against the result map, because, given a prediction like ""80% chance Obama wins"", there are many different ways he could have arrived at his conclusion, and it would be more accurate to inspect the method by which he arrived at the conclusion compared to the margins in the state.<p>I've put up a text file comparing the two here: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/0RB5GRjQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/0RB5GRjQ</a> and it turns out the results were within Nate's given interval in 49 of 50 states.

It usually materializes in costs becoming too great but the underlying cause frequently is a rushed product that eventually costs too much to iterate on because of sloppy underpinnings.  Its a delicate balance - you've got to get stuff out quick enough but also stable enough to make sure the next iterations wont become exponentially longer and more costly.<p>Outsourcing, high turnover, constantly changing requirements with unreasonable schedules all can lead to codebases that become too expensive to iterate on when the market demands more.  Sometimes the only way out is to approach a complete rewrite which is usually a risky proposition.<p>Many times poorly coded products from the outside can have correlated symptoms of poor performance, bugginess, and slow feature development which are the cited reasons users may abandon the product.",1352347421

4756453,comment,4756221,4756392,2,0,visualcsharp,,,"Thanks for making me aware of the AttributeRouting project; I had not heard of it before.<p>From quickly reading about AttributeRouting, the biggest difference between it and JuniorRoute is that AttributeRouting apparently sits on top of the ASP.NET MVC framework and Web API--both of those technologies are flawed, in my opinion. JuniorRoute does not; instead, JuniorRoute hooks directly into the ASP.net pipeline and does not reference a single ASP.NET MVC binary.<p>When I set out building this, I was determined to provide a solution that implemented routing in an HTTP-centric way, not the controller-centric way that ASP.NET MVC does. I think I've managed to accomplish this but I'm only one man and my opinion is, of course, biased. :)<p>The AttributeRouting project has it right with regards to attributes, but the project's foundation--ASP.NET MVC--is still flawed.<p>Some developers scoff at the use of attributes because they view attributes as magic. In my experience, attributes are a great way to implement the convention-over-configuration paradigm, but purists may choose to rely on other mechanisms for generating routes. I was sure to design the framework such that both camps--the pragmatists and the purists--could be made happy.<p>JuniorRoute provides built-in conventions that use endpoint namespaces, class names and method names to generate routes (this is similar to FubuMVC). The great thing is, developers can very easily extend JuniorRoute and create their own convention implementations if the built-in ones are insufficient.<p>Another way JuniorRoute differs from AttributeRouting is much of JuniorRoute's source code implements the HTTP 1.1 specification directly. For example, JuniorRoute's CacheableResponseHandler class handles prevalidation headers (the If-* headers). Obviously, JuniorRoute is open-source so anyone can look at the class and determine how it does that or implement their own response handler that follows the specification in a different way. ASP.NET MVC tends to hide things like that. I wanted developers to be able to choose from a stock of built-in conventions providing implementations of the most common scenarios but still have the extensibility just in case JuniorRoute doesn't cover something they need.<p>There are very few classes in JuniorRoute that do not implement interfaces. I designed the framework to be nearly completely extensible while still keeping bootstrapping code and configuration to a minimum. One of my biggest goals is to keep the amount of time between bootstrapping and writing endpoint methods to a minimum. I will be releasing Visual Studio project templates to make initial bootstrapping even simpler; right now, there are a lot of manual steps because one must begin with the ASP.NET Empty Web Application template.",1352347257

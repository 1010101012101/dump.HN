It's all about having the fastest, shiniest, device. And if you can't keep up or deliver ever demanding performance increases, you die.

The main thread doesn't always have the highest priority. In fact, its priority level changes throughout an application.<p>3. There is more than just one reason iOS rendering is so fast. Here are two important ones:<p>a. Animation is actually the basis of the entire rendering system. On desktop Cocoa, the drawing system was a little dated. The mistakes learned from this system and the desire to have fast animation led to the Core Animation framework and the idea of ""layers"". The ability to quickly composite layers (without moving any data from between the CPU and GPU) and only redraw when necessary is huge.<p>b. The batching together of drawing updates at the end of an event instead of on an as needed basis allows for huge performance gains.<p>* It is possible to draw in a background thread, but is reserved for particular situations (maps, web content, etc.).

3316376,comment,3315188,3315500,13,0,bluekeybox,,,"> Sentience just happens to be an evolutionary trait that was beneficial to us ... but that isn't really how evolution works.<p>Actually that <i>is</i> how evolution works. Evolution results in species acquiring traits that are beneficial to them. Of course you could make a counter-case that perhaps sentience is only beneficial to <i>us</i> in particular, and not so much to other species --<p>To which I would completely disagree. There is this fascinating, relatively new theory of how humans became sentient. Previously (1960s) it was thought that humans became sentient either somehow out of the blue or due to having to construct tools etc., which then allowed them to organize into groups. The new theory, on the other hand, claims that high intelligence (and by extension sentience) is an inevitable consequence of living within a particular type of group -- largely the type of group that many primates live in (the original studies were done on baboons), though this is not limited to primates.<p>The idea is that if you are a member of a group where grooming behavior, alliance-making, and status-related interactions are common, you benefit tremendously (in a reproductive sense) from possessing a ""theory of mind"" capable of making predictions about the actions of others that are at least a few percent more accurate than those of your peers. The way it works is a bit like the stock market -- all you need is to beat the market average. So this ""theory of mind"" -- being preoccupied with what others think -- is actually claimed to be a runaway effect of the intelligence ""arms race"" which always occurs among animals living within that type of group. Now, sentience is merely a theory of mind applied to self.<p>I fully expect that within the next 10 million years at least two other mammal species will become sentient, if we humans don't make them extinct that is...

Everyone thinks of the persistent vegetative state, but it's very unlikely you'll end up in one. It's more likely you'll be days away from death and passed out in a haze of exhaustion and morphine, with a ventilator doing little more than prolonging this scenario. Do you want the ventilator removed? Do you want CPR if you're hospitalized for a terminal condition? What if you're hospitalized for a non-terminal condition?<p>> Is it sufficient enough to have a living will, for example?<p>It sure helps, so do that. But also make sure to designate one of your loved ones in particular as your power of attorney. Make sure it's someone who understands and is capable of carrying out your wishes. That person will stay in close contact with health care professionals and has the legal right to make any and all decisions should you be incapacitated. In my limited experience, no one even looks at the living will if there's someone with clear power of attorney telling them what to do.<p>This person has an even more important job, at least in the American health care system: they're often the only one who talks to <i>all</i> the doctors and has the big picture. If you're seeing five different specialists, and they're all talking about their own specialties, no one is necessarily in charge of the big picture. In the outpatient world you have a primary care doctor, but when you're hospitalized, this guy's out of the picture. There is probably a hospitalist in charge of your care, but just like the nurses, the hospitalists rotate on shifts, and don't really coordinate with specialists so much as just trying to keep you alive. You need someone to be power of attorney, and to take the job seriously. One of the striking things, to me, about Steve Jobs' biography was that even for him, this was true--his wife was the one coordinating the doctors and keeping in charge of the big picture.<p>> Are there documents out there that I should be carrying in my wallet, and do paramedics seek these documents out in an emergency?<p>No. I've had paramedics at my house for my dad twice, and they never looked in his wallet. On the other hand, I was there both times.<p>The job of a paramedic is to stabilize you, gather whatever information they can, and take you to the ER. They probably don't give a shit about your wallet or your cell phone. Whatever procedure there is for identifying someone's next of kin and finding their advance directives, it's done in the hospital. Most of the time they just ask you, if you're conscious, and they ask whoever is physically with you at the time. They would only resort to searching you and your effects if you were completely alone, or if no one around you knew anything or anyone. So designate your power of attorney and designate that person as your emergency contact at work. If you don't live with that person, make sure a neighbor or roommate or someone else you live with or close to has that person's number programmed into their phone and knows to contact them. You want a <i>person you trust</i>, not just a tattoo or bracelet or document, in charge here.",1323117195

Humans are all irrational; anyone who claims to be rational is, in fact, irrationally rejecting the overwhelming preponderance of evidence.<p>The best we can do is be aware of our irrationality and attempt to compensate with tools like checklists, blind resume screening, empirical data, and awareness of biases to inform cultural and personal behavioral modifications to minimize the harm that irrationality can do to our field, our businesses and people around us.<p>For example, any time a human has a defensive reaction to something and lashes out with an attempt to dismiss or discredit the speaker rather than the argument it is probably because they interpreted the statement as a personal attack on their identity.  That is, if someone says ""bicyclists who run red lights endanger their own lives and the lives of people around them"" the people who respond angrily probably went through this unconscious thought process:\n""Endangering lives is bad! People who do so are bad people!""\n""I run red lights on my bike, so the speaker is accusing me of being a bad person!""\n""Well, they probably aren't even a bicyclist/don't know my specific commute/don't understand how hard it is to cycle to work every day, so what would they know?""\n""Whew, I'm not a bad person after all!""<p>And then they will probably feel superior because they rejected a poorly supported argument, or an insufficiently supported argument, no matter how much evidence is presented.  What should have been evidence against their behavior instead strengthened their commitment to it.  I recommend the recent book ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" for a more complete explanation of this process and the relevant citations.<p>The practical implication of this is that whenever one's first reaction is defensive dismissal of someone's report of their personal, first-person experience of the world, it isn't because they are wrong: it is because their experience being true threatens one's own self-image.  That they may be wrong or purposefully lying are merely post-hock justifications for an initial emotional response.",1323116553

3316285,comment,3314679,3314679,13,0,zedshaw,,,"I'd say not bad for the initial draft.  I don't really think it's for ""anyone"" though.  It seems like it's written by a programmer for other beginning programmers.  That's just my first review without going through it more thoroughly.  Here's some feedback based on going through it real quick:<p>1. The main link leads to <a href=""http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/about/</a> which talks about the book, but it took me forever to figure out that I go to the top where the little ""Contents"" link is to actually read the book.<p>2. I think you're whole first chapter with cut-paste could work, but I would provide the files.  On a technical level there's all sorts of problems with cut-paste out of a browser and into code.  It's rare but it's problematic, either by browser encoding problems or sloppy mouse usage.  I'd set up a little .zip file with the code in it so they can just run it that way.  Personally though, I find cut-paste has almost no value in actually teaching people to code, but I get you're trying to get them interested.<p>3. Your first real chapter, ""Conventions"" is just too much for most actual beginners.  It is throwing in complicated inject calls, blocks, a really gnarly block of code that no programmer with any style would ever write, and other oddities.  I'd recommend reworking this chapter so either it's at the end and is a capstone on ""idiomatic"" ruby style, or ditch the convoluted examples and keep it simple.  Also, don't be fooled if someone who can already code tells you this is awesome.  For an already capable programmer this is good, but for ""anybody"" this is just way too much and you'll lose them here.<p>4. You seem to spend a lot of time trying to convince the reader why they should learn to code.  So far most of the material I've read has been the kind of stuff to pump them up and get them excited.  Maybe you think that's necessary, but if that is your goal, then go back and rewrite some of your examples so that they're more accessible and people will think ""oh man, I can totally get this!""  Right now I think they would think ""yeah! totally! oh wait, wtf is that shit?""<p>5. In the chapter on methods, why on earth are you showing them the C code to Ruby's implementation of puts?  I really think that has no place in this book and wonder why it's even there.  The link to the code isn't even valid anymore, which should tell you one reason why this is bad: Ruby's C code changes to quickly. The other reason is Ruby's C code is just bad.  Not only are you overloading the student with C code in a Ruby book, but you're showing them very weird C code.<p>Overall I think you've got a book for programmers who want to learn Ruby, and not really a book for beginners or ""anybody"".  Programmers would love this book because there's not many free good ruby books that are this extensive except for _why's (and that's crazy so many programmers can't handle it).  You should basically consider making up your mind.  Is it for beginners?  Ok, then ditch everything complicated and redesign the order you teach things.  If it's for programmers who can already code, then keep doing what you've got here.  I'd place it at maybe intermediate programmers or beginners.",1323116357

It is behind a paywall but I found a freely available copy here: <a href=""http://www.mcgill.ca/files/economics/leavescience_all.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mcgill.ca/files/economics/leavescience_all.pdf</a> . It's a nice article. I don't think it supports laying the blame on sexism, though.<p>The paper focuses on something called the ""exit rate"", that is, how many people with a certain education are working at a job unrelated to their education. The average exit rate over all professions and both genders is 21%. Female engineers have a pretty low exit rate of 12.9% - that is, 12.9% of women who studied engineering now work in other areas. Male engineers, on the other hand, have an extremely low exit rate of 9.8%.<p>The author then tries to explain the difference between ""pretty low"" for women and ""extremely low"" for men. She observes that the differentials in exit rate, across all fields including engineering, can be mostly predicted by the gender makeup of the field. Quote from the paper's conclusion:<p>> <i>The results would appear to point to problems for women speci\fc to the engineering\nprofession. However, I show that the excess exits of women trained as engineers, as well\nas their excess exits for pay and promotion reasons, are no larger than would be expected\ngiven the share of men in the \ffield: the higher the male share, the greater the excess female\nexits from the fi\feld, both in total and for pay and promotion reasons.</i><p>Then the author hypothesizes that improving mentoring and reducing ""possible discrimination"" might help reduce the gap, without giving any specific arguments.<p>It seems to me that the really important figure in the paper is 9.8%, not 12.9%-9.8%. That is, more males are behaving abnormally by staying programmers despite possible problems with pay and promotion, while the behavior of female engineers is closer to the average rational human being. What do you think?<p>Also, I'd be really interested in seeing what you think are the <i>best</i> papers proving that the lack of women of IT is due to sexism. Taking apart random vaguely related papers is fun, but I don't have infinite time.",1323115904

When you break up TIMSS by ethnic groups, the US performs comparably to other counties across the board (Asians, Europeans, etc). [1] There's something to be said about the differences between attempting to educate a racially diverse population versus a largely homogenous one.<p>I've done more analysis on a similar test called PISA, but I think it's worth bringing up in the context of this debate. In standardized testing there are often significant underlying factors that have nothing to do with the schools themselves. From the executive summary of PISA: ""[In the United States], after accounting for socio-economic \nbackground, the performance difference between students from single-parent families and those from other types of \nfamilies stands at 23 score points.... Parents’ engagement with their children’s reading life has a positive impact on their children’s reading performance."" Consider that the divorce rate in the US is one of the highest in the world, 5 times that of China.  This problem along with any others is one that needs to be considered in the context of education.<p>Also, PISA was not done on China, but rather on two specific cities: Shanghai and Hong Kong (similarly, TIMSS was done in Hong Kong). Along with Beijing, these are the most advantaged areas in China in terms of both money and education. The US administers PISA to a wide range of schools across the country. I imagine we would see much different results if PISA only tested Boston and some other advantaged city. The PISA study itself even notes that scores were much higher in urban schools. Other countries are either testing exclusively urban schools or urban schools at a higher rate than the US.<p>There are serious, serious problems with education in the US. But it's important to look at these studies with a critical eye and avoid the temptation to go off on a rant on how the US is bad at math. Data doesn't lie, but analysis is often wrong and/or exaggerated.  In sum, problems with education in the US are deeply rooted in racial, social, and geographic issues. Better management practices and policy reform, while good, doesn't change the fact that the US isn't Singapore.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2009/2009001_suptables.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2009/2009001_suptables.pdf</a>",1323115374

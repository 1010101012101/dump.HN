Including the &quot;rich and powerful&quot;.<p><i>Second, that wealthy and powerful people won&#x27;t simply sue or bribe publishers to withhold or delete the embarrassing material.</i><p>That does not work in the real world. The rich and powerful have been trying to restrict information getting out for years. Snowden and Streisand are living proof of this. The continued explosions in the faces of people who try to do this are further proof.<p>That old saying about the internet interpreting censorship (and we can quibble about the wheretos and the whyfores all day long, but at the end of the day, this definitely fits the definition of censorship) as damage?

I think the reason more people make these short-sighted bad decisions is exactly because they&#x27;re being told that being in poverty doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the personal decisions you make but your &#x27;circumstance&#x27;. If we tell people this, what motivation do they have to make prudent long-term decisions at the expense of short-term gratification?

Go <i>is</i> simple, but it&#x27;s not always easy.  It&#x27;s like the difference between building a house using pre-fab walls, and building a house using studs and nails.  Which one is easier?  Probably pre-fab walls.  Which one is simpler?  Probably studs & nails.  You don&#x27;t need a crane to put the walls in place, you can do it with just a hammer and 1-2 guys.  It might take a little longer, but you&#x27;ll have exactly the house you want.<p>Your simple/easy comparison with an ORM is a very valid one, I think.  ORMs seem easy, but they&#x27;re not simple, and often times their easyness at the outset causes complexity once you have to do anything that goes off the rails they&#x27;ve laid out for you.<p>But I think Go is the opposite of an ORM.  There&#x27;s very little magic, nothing gets done &quot;for you&quot;.  The code does what you tell it to do, no more, no less.

investments are driven by the traditional profit-motive. However, economists
are increasingly realizing that not all new technologies originate in this way.
An important example is Open Source Software (OSS), where programmers at many
different locations and organizations share code to develop new software. This
process was important in the development of the Internet, contributing such
software as TCP/IP, BIND, Perl, Sendmail, Linux, Mozilla and Apache. What
initially baffled economists was that OSS developers did not seem to benefit
financially from their efforts. OSS is, in effect, a public good, which raises
the question why OSS programmers contribute voluntarily, without pay, to the
public good.  Lerner and Tirole (2002) argued that economic theory may, in
fact, be able to answer this question. Their main hypothesis is that software
developers have career concerns.  Contributing to the OSS may be a credible
signal of one&#x27;s programming ability, which may lead to job offers, shares in
commercial open source-based companies, or access to the venture-capital
market.35 Drawing on a previous literature on career concerns (e.g., Holmstrom,
1982), they argue that the signaling motive is stronger the more visible is
performance, the higher the impact of effort on performance, and the more
informative performance is about talent. They find support for the signaling
motive in four case studies (Apache, Linux, Perl and Sendmail). Subsequent
research also found support for Lerner and Tirole&#x27;s (2002) signaling theory, at
least for some OSS projects (e.g., Hann, Roberts and Slaughter, 2013, for
Apache). However, programmers seem to contribute to OSS for a variety of
reasons, perhaps including altruism. A satisfactory explanation of OSS
development may require a mixture of signaling theory and insights, like those
of 2009 Economics Laureate Elinor Ostrom, into how cooperative behavior can be
supported by norms and other social mechanisms (O&#x27;Mahony, 2003).",1413574688

That static 10 page info site for your church group? Yup, get it set up! The no-CSS blog from 1991 (before they were blogs)? Set it up! Even if you don&#x27;t use WordPress (god, please tell me you are not running WordPress without SSL), and your site never lets anyone POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH to it, remember that what people are reading is just as important. If I can hijack your site at the local coffee shop and serve malware, your readers will not be pleased. If I manage to do this in a widespread fashion, Google/Bing will blacklist your site and nobody will get to it.<p>2. Get a free cert! The dirty secret is that all certs are basically equal (EV and wildcard notwithstanding, though they are an entirely different matter). There are at least two places to get decent free certs: StartSSL and CloudFlare. If you want to protect something but your 10 page church website, get a cert from Namecheap for $8/year.<p>3. Use HTTPS-only. TFA is a great example: it&#x27;s posted on a blog that can be accessed by both HTTP and HTTPS. If you leave this configuration, it&#x27;s almost as bad as not having HTTPS at all. People don&#x27;t type in &quot;<a href=""https://...&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://...&quot;</a>. They go straight to &quot;example.com&quot; or they&#x27;ll just Google &quot;example&quot; and click on the first link. Set up your server to redirect from port 80 straight to the canonical HTTPS version of your site.<p>If you are unfamiliar with how to set this up: practice. Get a Digital Ocean box for a few hours ($0.10/hour) and a free cert from StartSSL. Use a random domain name you own (you&#x27;ll need a proper second level domain, but chances are you have one parked somewhere) and try setting up a site. It&#x27;ll cost you as much as a single stick of gum and you&#x27;ll know that much more about how to do it.<p>Edit:<p>4. Use a strong cipher suite such as this one: <a href=""https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200933580-What-cipher-suites-does-CloudFlare-use-for-SSL-"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200933580-W...</a><p>5.

I had a similar (ish) experience working at a startup that was in way over its head making hardware.  I got out earlier than he did (I only lasted a few months).  My only advice is that if you&#x27;re working at a startup and you don&#x27;t have confidence in the management, definitely get out.<p>I also worked at a very well-run company (Laurel Networks) that also sold an appliance running embedded Linux in the early 2000s.  We basically shipped a modified Red Hat 9.  I was on the OS team.  Our main concern was making sure no unnecessary ports were exposed or services running.  We didn&#x27;t have quite the same focus on creating the absolute minimum OS image size since our product included a hard disk.  We had similar concerns with providing a seamless (and secure) upgrade path.<p>I think disk size is not that important in embedded Linux any more.  If you&#x27;re shipping a router that has its OS on a read-only compact flash card, you&#x27;ll struggle to even find a CF card under 32 MB these days.  They just don&#x27;t manufacture them.  So there&#x27;s not much incentive to squeeze things on to a floppy disk any more.  Microcontrollers still exist out there, but they don&#x27;t run Linux (or usually any OS)-- usually they&#x27;re just a &quot;for&quot; loop on bare metal.<p>On the other hand, minimizing the amount of code you&#x27;re running is as important as ever.  The more code you&#x27;re running, the bigger the attack surface is.  I hope that the Toybox project gains some traction out there as an option for folks that need it.",1413573454

Maybe it gives you 80% of vim&#x27;s productivity for 1/4th of the effort, but make no mistake, vim is an absurdly powerful tool which I&#x27;m 99% sure beats Sublime out of the water (though, again, I never got deep into Sublime, so take this with a grain of salt).<p>Oh and the learning curve thing is greatly exaggerated, often by vim users themselves, seeking to brag to everyone about how they mastered the &quot;fearsome learning curve of vim&quot;.",1413572733

A lot of people look at carbs only from the perspective of diabetes, weight gain, and taxing your pancreas, but there&#x27;s more - don&#x27;t ignore glycation, which has harmful effects way beyond diabetes, which is considered to be &quot;accelerated aging&quot; due to AGEs [1]. My supplementation is specifically targeting AGEs and try to reduce fast carbs as much as possible. I love yams, cold potatoes with vinegar and cold rice (to get resistant starch), and raw fruits, so, I&#x27;m not saying carbs should be avoided at all, but definitely should be reduced to a bare minimum and in forms where you get more than just carbs - loads of phytochemicals. Commercial pasta and bread are terrible not only because of the carbs, but also because of the fortification - folic acid should be avoided as roughly 30% cannot metabolize it and free folic acid is without a doubt harmful - especially to Mexicans due to wide-spread methylation issues. If you have 23andMe, go check your methylation and detox profile here [2] (it&#x27;s a free service). It was an eye-opening subject to me and explained much of the evidence why blindly (over)supplementing could be harmful!<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_glycation_end-product"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_glycation_end-product</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://geneticgenie.org/methylation-analysis/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://geneticgenie.org/methylation-analysis/</a>",1413572511

I speak with my folks when i visit India about how they use technology. The use cases are very practical such as turning off/on the pumpset, since the fields are far and the power comes and goes at different times, this kind of app is amazing. I can think of similar use cases once IoT takes off. ex: Checking the water levels in paddy fields (The crabs make holes and if you are out of luck all the water is gone, resulting in midnight trips to fields to make sure everything is fine). The startups which might provide these kind of services will do well only if the internet is free, else FB will build its own apps to do this. FB will have a monopoly over the future use cases.

Part of the driving force of the trends in global poverty is globalization. And despite what I said earlier about middle-class America, I don&#x27;t necessarily cry for the loss of overall wealth in this country, if it means greater equity for the rest of the world (I just wish the richest people in the world were paying a greater share).<p><i>&quot;global poverty is on a steep decline.&quot;</i><p>This is <i>highly</i> debatable. The data you linked to seems to be mostly based on the World Bank data -- a single, rarely modified, global metric of $1.25 (now $1.90) a day, using self-reported statistics. Meanwhile, regional context is critical -- for example, sub-saharan Africa has actually seen <i>increases</i> in poverty. In India and China, there&#x27;s good reason to believe that wealth inequality is <i>increasing</i> [1]:<p><i>&quot;the benefits of economic growth in many developing countries often accrue to the rich. In India and China, inequality has been increasing in recent years. From 1981 to 2010, the average poor person in sub-Saharan Africa saw no increase in their income even as economies expanded. Because there is no household data since 2012, it is impossible to know if these trends towards greater inequality have since changed.&quot;</i><p>Meanwhile, the metric itself is questionable (ibid):<p><i>&quot;Someone living today at the new poverty line does not necessarily enjoy the same standard of living as someone at the old line did in the past, however....Looking at national price indices rather than PPPs, half of the world’s population live in countries in which $1.90 buys you less now than $1.25 did back in 2005, according to a paper released this week by Sanjay Reddy of the New School for Social Research in New York.&quot;</i><p>Even the <i>World Bank itself</i> acknowledges that poverty is on the increase in sub-saharan Africa (a region, which, by the way, has over a billion people, or 1/7th of the world&#x27;s current population) [2]:<p><i>&quot;However, despite its falling poverty rates, Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region in the world for which the number of poor individuals has risen steadily and dramatically between 1981 and 2010. There are more than twice as many extremely poor people living in SSA today (414 million) than there were three decades ago (205 million). As a result, while the extreme poor in SSA represented only 11 percent of the world’s total in 1981, they now account for more than a third of the world’s extreme poor. India contributes another third (up from 22 percent in 1981) and China comes next, contributing 13 percent (down from 43 percent in 1981).&quot;</i><p>In other words: it&#x27;s great that more people are self-reporting as living on more than this bottom-of-the-barrel income metric, but it isn&#x27;t really a counter-argument to my point, except to say that we&#x27;ve made the absolute <i>poorest of the poor</i> a bit less poor. Maybe.

However, as an annual, alfalfa comes to maturity relatively quickly, and doesn&#x27;t require much in the way of ongoing water. As a farmer, if I plant alfalfa this year, it&#x27;s very easy for me to sell the alfalfa and switch to something else next year when water prices go up.<p>Almond trees, on the other hand, require three to four years of water before they become mature enough to produce fruit. That means, as a farmer, if I choose to plant almonds, I&#x27;m locked in for the better part of a decade before I can recoup my investment. And yet, somehow, even in the middle of the longest running and most severe drought in California history, I read reports of farmers planting new almond trees, knowing full well that those trees are going to be sucking water for three to four years before they get even a single harvest. That&#x27;s how confident these farmers are that the state of California is going bail them out with multi-billion dollar public works projects.

That&#x27;s probably the way this will work out. That&#x27;s a good thing; it means the manufacturer has every incentive to avoid crashes.  Manufacturers will insure against this and build that into the price.<p>- User tracking: OnStar has that now. The next question is whether Big Google will permit you to opt out.  Urmson, Google&#x27;s head of automatic driving, says they don&#x27;t need car to car communication. It&#x27;s better to use sensor data. Lots of things on the road won&#x27;t be equipped to talk, anyway.<p>- Information leakage: what&#x27;s the question?  Security, or privacy?<p>- Failure modes: there needs to be enough backup capability to get the vehicle stopped without a collision after any single component failure, and enough fault detection to detect any single component failure.  It&#x27;s probably sufficient to have two forward-facing radars with a backup computer monitoring the second one, dual actuators for steering and brakes, and backup throttle cutoff.  The other side of failure is driving into a situation that the system can&#x27;t handle.  But that&#x27;s usually a problem that appears slowly, as with heavy rain or fog, rather than all at once.<p>- Aggressiveness settings: this hasn&#x27;t been a big problem for Google, other than having to edge into intersections in some situations.

PaKa was written first and SiSa was written a dozen or so years later but historically SiSa happens about a decade or two before PaKa. PaKa is short (one-fifth the size of the other two). I liked the story of PaKa a lot. [although the movie version was totally butchered]. And just like how PoSe (which happens about 300 years after PaKa/SiSa) is all about Chozhas, the other two are about Pallavas. Very fascinating reads - will totally recommend it.<p>If you like Science and Music (in this case, western classical music), and biographies/history related to the science/music characters, then you will like my list a lot.\nPlease feel free to get in touch offline - can share more details.

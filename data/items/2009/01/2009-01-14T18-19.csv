434040,comment,433866,433866,0,0,m104,,,"What's so wrong with simple profit sharing?  The only place I've worked at (or even heard of, for that matter) that implemented a form of true profit sharing was Outback Steakhouse.  Servers got tips, so are exempt, but hosts, cooks, and bussing staff got cold hard cash on their next work day that came straight from the profits of the entire restaurant from their previous work day.  Simple, effective, and gloriously rewarding.<p>For an IT shop, each worker's salary/wage sets their base pay and is confidential, while a biweekly or monthly ""bonus"" check could be the profit sharing reward.  In that environment, everyone knows when business is going well and everyone knows when it isn't.  Profit sharing can (and should) be open for discussion among all employees.<p>So, take Joel's example:  Noah helps make an additional $1 million in a year for Fog Creek.  What's that going to translate into for each employee's profit sharing check?  I'll assume that Joel's generous, and that the ads are wonderfully profitable, so let's say an additional $400/mo/employee (average) while the ads are active.  Holy shit, Noah, thanks!  So, Noah get's more.  Noah gets recognitions.  Noah's coworkers get more.  The company makes more.  Hell, even Joel gets to make more.  It's win/win/win/win.<p>And don't get me started on company stock.  Stock is fine in many cases, but that's not what successful organizations make.  They make money!  Share it with the employees.  They deserve it.  'Cause here's the thing:  If your take-home wage isn't tied to your performance or the performance of the company as a whole, what exactly is everyone's motivation?  Oh, sure, <i>some</i> people are going to do a great job no matter what, but that's not what really makes a company great, now is it?",1231959535

If I remember correctly, AIM was an AOL subscription exclusive in the beginning so only the dopes on there were using it. The cool kids were on ICQ and I think there were very few AOL users willing or able to use a separate chat client.<p>Anyway, AOL eventually opened up AIM to everyone and people started using it. It was easier. AIM used screennames. ICQ was cool because you could use any name you wanted but the actual user id was an 8 or 9 digit number (mine was 36915037- not sure why I remember that). It was a total pain in the ass when you wanted to add people to your friend list. Plus, on ICQ you had to receive approval from a user to add them to your buddy list and on AIM you could just add people. Sometimes, you'd sit there in pending approval purgatory wondering if you added the right person with those crazy user id's. AIM was just plain easier.<p>ICQ had more features and more users, but it was just easier for a lot of them to use AIM so they could chat with their dopey friends who were still using AOL. Meanwhile, AIM was updated with new features frequently and marketed heavily. ICQ still remained relatively popular, but they really sat on their asses over there. After a while AIM caught up and even experimented with video and voice chat while ICQ stayed the same for years.<p>Eventually, AOL purchased ICQ and basically put it out to pasture.

433943,comment,433695,433695,0,0,cadalac,,,"Interesting. One thing I have to disagree with is where he says philosophy isn’t logical (logic was actually invented for philosophy). Is philosophy just peoples whims and opinions then? Now a day’s everybody have big opinions about politics, sports and so on, but what’s scary is that we actually believe that after 5 seconds of thought we have found the problem or the answer (watch sports commentators for example). What’s even scarier is that sometimes we even believe that we’re the only ones who see the answer, seeing ourselves as smart ones who have everything figured out. Enough of a rant, let’s continue. Logic is the foundation philosophy. The proof is very similar to PGs proof that good art or good design isn’t subjective. A trick that most philosophers use in creating an argument is formulating it in a way that the outcome either yes or no. Like “Whether God exist”. St. Tomas Aquinas, who was probably the greatest philosopher, wrote his whole summa in this fashion. I believe the concept (and the basic logical foundation of philosophy) came from Aristotle. But anyway this shows that logic is the foundation of philosophy.<p>Philosophy is important because what people believe has a huge influence, either good or bad on society. A philosopher is in a way a psychologist for society, but his prime goal is to discover the truth. Philosophy also doesn’t have to be complicated and obscure (this is just a stupid stereotype). Philosophy is really just the most practical use of logic and common sense, which most people don’t have and would do well to develop. You develop good logical thought by first learning the basic theory behind it, and then developing a mental habit of continuously using your logical faculties throughout your daily life. But first we have to stop thinking we now everything and admit we know nothing, because we then become students to Logic and we reap in the dividends for the rest of our lives.",1231956329

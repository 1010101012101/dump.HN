Little boys who would otherwise sit in the corner at the bar and completely avoid actual interaction with women get very brave when they have 30 of their friends backing them.  It was disgusting.

Spreading moderators around would do nothing to help about bioaccumulation.</i><p>That&#x27;s basically correct.  There won&#x27;t be a fission chain reaction because essentially no neutrons are released by the radioactive decay of the isotopes in the fallout.  Consequently, deploying neutron moderators would have essentially no effect. (It&#x27;d be like, say, taking a life jacket with you on a hike through the Sahara.)<p>The relevant radioactive isotopes are mainly caesium 137, iodine 131, and strontium 90 [1].  When they decay into other elements, they release beta- and gamma radiation, which can damage nearby cells if ingested into the body.  But none of them fissions to release neutrons that would be absorbed by graphite or boron.<p>The danger posed by these isotopes is that if you inhale or swallow them, they can stick around in your body tissues, zapping nearby cells, for a long time. For example, caesium 137 has an estimated biological <i>half</i> life of 70 days [2], while strontium 90, which is taken into bone much like calcium, has an estimated biological half life of 18 years [3].<p>A major forest fire in the Chernobyl area would turn contaminated trees into contaminated smoke. Who knows where the wind would blow the smoke.  The resulting fallout could be inhaled and/or swallowed by people and other animals. It also might fall on farmland, where it could be up-taken by crops that <i>would</i> eventually be swallowed.

He was also drinking about 1 letter of milk daily straight from his cow and in case you never drank raw unprocessed milk, let me tell you it&#x27;s freaking fat compared to what you find in store. He was also drinking about 1 letter of his own wine and a couple of shots of his own brandy per day. His favorite dish was also raw pig bacon though because of their relative poverty, this wasn&#x27;t happening often, maybe once or twice per month.<p>He died at 99, one month from turning 100. Never had heart disease, never had cholesterol problems. He lived in an area in which all the people have similar dietary habits. In fact if you&#x27;ll ever come to Romania, you&#x27;ll notice that only the French eat fatter and IMHO the jury is still out on that one, because while the French use tons of butter for everything, I think we are eating more pork-based dishes (bathed in sunflower oil), more than anybody else, pork being way more popular than fish, beef or even chicken (during the holidays). You should see my favorite dishes ;-)<p>The above is just an anecdote of course, but do take studies with a grain of salt, especially studies on nutrition. Such studies cannot control or even estimate all the variables involved (short of keeping subjects in a cage locked away for 20 years) and cannot be conducted doubly-blind. We are a long way off to understanding anything about the impact of our diet.<p>Also, it should make you wonder why in the world your medics declared war on fat since 1960, while they ignored the biggest elephant in the room, which is our increased intake of sugar.",1394905698

Yes it is true that it would be trivial to exchange all my BTC for another cryptocurrency, but the reason I don&#x27;t is because there is already so much infrastructure in the mainstream for BitCoin, and more every day. The cost of switching to another currency would be losing access to all this available, mainstream infrastructure and seriously limit my buying power.<p>For another currency to supplant BitCoin it would have to fundamentally offer something that BitCoin does not, in a way that convinces mainstream operators like BitPay and CoinBase to start offering solutions for those currencies. So far 99% of the cryptocurrencies are just slight adjustments of the parameters of BTC. The only two technologies so far that may offer something that BitCoin does not are Ripple and Ethereum. It will probably take a few years, if not more, for those technologies to gain widespread adoption because people are just barely wrapping their heads around BitCoin - let alone smart contracts and autonomous corporations.<p>A lot of is also brand strength. You see the exchanges and other mainstream enterprises latching onto the BitCoin brand because they do not want to dilute the brand and confuse their potential customers.",1394904793

In ten years, I still have the same amount of gold.  But if I buy a great business like Coca-Cola, in ten years the employees of Coca-Cola will have been working hard to expand the business and I&#x27;ll have more than when I started.  So buying gold is kind of stupid.&quot;  (It&#x27;s been a number of years, so this is a paraphrase)<p>Gold actually does have intrinsic value, even if it isn&#x27;t the best investment:  it is a metal, it doesn&#x27;t tarnish or corrode, it looks nice, and it is easily malleable.  So gold gets used for electronic contacts (no corrosion, good conductivity) and jewelry (pretty, doesn&#x27;t corrode, malleable) come to mind.  Gold hasn&#x27;t been used as a coin in years, but is still valuable, thus demonstrating that it has intrinsic value.<p>What can you make out of bitcoin?  Nothing.  If everyone lost their bitcoin keys (and therefore could not use them as a medium of exchange,) you could do nothing with them.  Hence, no intrinsic value. He is pointing out that bitcoin is medium of exchange, not something with intrinsic value.

But this claim is astounding to me.<p>I believe that if you placed a properly resonant circuit into an MRI device, for example, you could charge a decent sized battery (but probably not a vehicle propulsion battery) at a reasonable rate.<p>But it would be horribly inefficient and your car (and everything else in your garage) shouldn&#x27;t be made of ferrous metal.<p>Cell phone batteries on little charger pads, sure. Maybe even via ambient EM, though I&#x27;m not convinced you could get regulatory approval above a certain emissions level (which, critically, has an inverse-square relationship to available current delivery capacity at the device).<p>But the article also talks about lighting and televisions, and cars.

So, there was no way I was going to pass my 10+2 (last school year) without cheating and I am lucky that I somehow managed to cheat. I wish I could have cheated better so that the meagre Chemistry score couldn&#x27;t bring my total % to around 75. Anyway, bygone is bygone.<p>The matters were made worse by the uninterested, unintuitive and unqualified teachers (no exception), outdated and idiotic curricula, arcane books written in an ad-hoc manner, uninteresting tests. Everything was showing just one solution - rote, which I am pathologically allergic too (though sometimes I wish I had just done it like everybody else and this what I told my younger brother).<p>The result is I didn&#x27;t study Math, didn&#x27;t study Physics either and certainly didn&#x27;t study Geography. I took up Computer Science - just because it has the jobs. All along knowing fully well that you end up being a clerk or a daily wage worker (or a teacher which has a similar pay; professorship is rare) in this country if you try to follow your passion in studies and study anything other than a course that gives you a professional degree.

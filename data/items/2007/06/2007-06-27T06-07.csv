Not much effort for search. It doesn't have to be permanent. We sure need this functionality, now. <p>",1182925851
31033,comment,30950,30998,0,0,davidw,,,"Hrm.  I didn't like the quote at the top myself.  I thought it focused too much on the people making the thing, rather than something like ""Thanks to Virtualmin, I can manage 31415926 servers in just 10 minutes a day!"" or ""Here at hornywetsluts dot com, virtualmin has been a blessing - it let us take our business to the next level""...  Something customer focused, in short.",1182925840

This is why most flash games, even simple ones, prefer to run in a tiny window in the middle. (as originally designed). In other words, it does not scale to a ""web site"" level, but rather allows you to have richer ""components"" on your page, like advanced charts and such.

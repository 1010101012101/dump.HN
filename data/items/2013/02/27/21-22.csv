It's easy to imagine that ""application quality or capability"" is some easily measured metric tied to easy to measure numbers (like FPS or megahertz). In reality for many applications performance is not the long pole, so moving them to the web adds many advantages.

The way the JPEG encoder chooses this replacement pixel set is why you see the artifacts in areas with significant edges: JPEG deliberately removes the image counterpart to high-frequency data, much the same way that MPEG audio encoding removes high-frequency audio.<p>What you see is the ""Gibbs effect"" in the visual realm from deliberately throwing away that high frequency data, which is not at all due to ""treating a pixel as a point sample"" (since as before, that's the very definition of a pixel, a value at a point). The solution is easy enough: force JPEG to keep the extra data, by driving the quality to the maximum permitted level (at the penalty of horrible compression).<p>JPEG has other artifacts too (e.g. you can see the block size used by the encoder), but those are also not inherent to treating pixels as point samples but are instead inherent to the design of the encoder.",1362001512

5295050,comment,5294318,5294318,8,0,masklinn,,,"To add to other comments, things the author could have expanded upon:<p>* vararg keyword arguments (<i></i>kwargs)<p>* Keyword-only arguments (Python 3)<p>* help, vars, a few other nice introspective builtins<p>* Assignment unpacking (multiple names as left-hand side of an assignment)<p>* The strangest ""first blush"" difference between Ruby and Python, or at least the one which I found oddest when I first started switching, is that a new Ruby class is defined from the `class {Name}` line, the whole body executes in the context of the already-created class. Not so in Python, the class object will only exist once the body has finished executing.<p>* No mention of generators? Also outer v inner iteration is a pretty big split between two otherwise similar languages.<p>Mistake-ish<p>* obj.__dict__ -> vars(obj)<p>* obj.__class__ -> type(obj)<p>* Python's lambdas are not one-line, they're one-expression. The reason you ""can't do [this] in Python"" is that if:elif:else: is a statement, so doesn't fit in lambdas. But you can have arbitrary complex code in lambdas aside from that, by following <a href=""http://codon.com/programming-with-nothing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codon.com/programming-with-nothing</a>. For instance you can (although you should not) write:<p><pre><code>    map(lambda num:\n            0 if num % 3 == 0 else\n            num * 2 if num % 4 == 0 else\n            num,\n        range(1, 6))\n</code></pre>\n* Author talks about methods a lot. They're not methods, a method is part of an object. They're functions. Granular functions, inner functions, ...<p>* We generally don't say Python values ""evaluate to False"", we say they're falsy: they're <i>never</i> equal to False (outside of False and  for historical reasons  0), they're just equivalent when evaluated in a boolean context (or passed to `bool()`). Also, the list is <i>way</i> incomplete: <i>any Python type defines its own ""falsiness""</i> by implementing __bool__ (or __nonzero__ in Python 2)<p>* Python's reflection and metaprogramming are roughly on par with Ruby's, their lack of use is more of a cultural artefact (possibly historically motivated) than a technical one. Consider adding methods to existing types for instance. You can do it in Python (on python-defined types), you just very rarely do, it's not in the culture to do something like that. Same with using metaclasses, it's done but it generally isn't the first thing a Python developer will reach for, aside from things like registering classes on the fly/on definition<p>Odd comments:<p>* Ruby mixins, as far as I know, work by injecting the module in the inheritance chain somewhere above the new class. MI is clearer and just as powerful.",1362000359

The object has state, typically stored in a relational database management system. The object has methods (the URLs) and arguments to those methods (the inputs of the forms that target the URLs). The engineering challenges of Web development are (a) coming up with the correct data model for the object state, (b) coming up with a correct and maintainable organization of URLs, and (c) defining the semantics of each URL. By the time an individual page is constructed, the engineering challenge is over and it doesn't really matter whether you build that script in a simple language (e.g., Perl or Tcl) or a complex powerful language (e.g., Common Lisp or Java).</i><p><a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/wtr/aolserver/introduction-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philip.greenspun.com/wtr/aolserver/introduction-1.htm...</a><p>Philip also discusses this idea in chapter 13 of his classic book, ""Philip and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing"" (<a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/</a>).<p>But as Alan Kay points out, this RPC-type model still hasn't evolved to a point where you can pass around self-contained objects that are RCATWD.",1362000182

His work on the GUI was put into the Mac, Smalltalk directly influenced Objective-C, and the Dynabook is clearly a predecessor to the iPad. I don't think VPRI is a similar vehicle for new work.<p>It's a really tough dichotomy: people who invent world-changing things very rarely have the skills (or desire) to spend years polishing and shipping. I think almost all of academia is great example of this, where invention is praised over innovation.<p>I'm not saying this is bad. Researchers excel at doing research, and should focus in that domain. But papers and conference talks don't change the world. It takes <i>real</i> products, which are the result of substantial non-idea work. Even Doug Engelbart's famous demo took decades to actually build at scale.<p>One of the most important things about PARC may have been that it was a pairing of research-like projects with real world engineering accomplishments. For several years, I've felt like Google is on the verge of this as well. Glass may be their first shipping experimental product, so we'll see.<p>It'd be interesting if Alan took a research position at Google. Hal Abelson (inventor of Scheme, founder of Creative Commons, prof at MIT, etc.) spent a sabbatical there and shipped App Inventor for Android, which essentially took ideas from the Scratch programming environment and made them work for Android. Something like Smalltalk on top of App Engine could be really awesome.<p><pre><code>    When the Mac first came out, Newsweek asked me what I [thought] \n    of it.

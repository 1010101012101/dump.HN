They don't even have to litigate until the end of time - just until you run out of money, and unless you're made of it, that won't be all that long.  Meanwhile, while you're defending yourself, you're <i>not</i> running your business, or being a parent, or really anything.

But the app store ecosystem hasn't made that a huge factor.<p>Even under optimistic assumptions: 100% profit, average sale price of $5, 15% paid downloads, the numbers are not good:<p><pre><code>    400,000,000*0.15*5*0.3 = 90,000,000\n</code></pre>\nThat's nothing compared to the billions they are posting in profit each quarter.<p>The hardware margins are also almost certainly much higher than 20%, probably over 30% on a lot of the higher end hardware.",1274990225

Programs started on mainframe systems (client/server with a very dumb client) then moved to PCs once they had enough horsepower.  For most applications, a network architecture was just not feasible.<p>About the same time the Web was spinning up, network bandwidth and computer performance both started to drop in price, giving software designers the option of retaining a portion of the processing on their end.  While it does not replace the standalone desktop app, a ""cloud"" app affords many advantages which are too great to ignore.  (Compare Google Maps to the Road Atlas CD-ROM.)<p>You make a good point about ""what happens when we're offline"".  We suddenly can't use those awesome cloud apps, but that's the nature of the game -- these apps do things which are just impossible for a standalone app to do.  Networking is the price of admission.<p>I hope we'll see a popularization (commercialization?) of mesh networking in the not-too-distant future.  Pervasive mesh networking becomes more and more feasible as we have more and more wireless devices around us, and while it comes with its own set of unique technical constraints, it would go a long way to achieve a self-healing network at its outer edges.",1274989752

Just as I was thinking ""she is a safe defensive driver,"" she approached a stop sign and to my shock did not stop, but slowed down only to continue on her way much like a yield sign. I freaked out a little in the vein of ""Stop signs here are not suggestions!""  She responded with points simiar to yours (and the articles'): there are way too many stop signs in the US, it is the most expensive part of driving (fuel-wise), and it essentially teaches people not to be thoughtful, cautious drivers.  Now while driving I'm constantly thinking ""what a wasteful stop sign.""",1274987017

By which I mean are you aware that 2 million people pass through heathrow each day, London oscillates between 9 and 13 million people a day, it's the main gateway to Europe from the states and a financial world capital. If that doesn't attract talent from <i>around the world</i> I don't know what would. Sure, plenty of people would rather work at a bank than a startup but it's the same anywhere. The difference is the sheer number of people, not to mention local universities like Imperial and UCL, not forgetting other universities with niche specialisms like Royal Holloway and Westminster with information security.<p>> Secondly, even if you have people with good talent available, many of them see the London finance machine as their destination of choice<p>As I've mentioned earlier, some would rather work for a bank than a startup, but there's plenty in London that doesn't directly involve finance. If it comes across that finance companies may be potential clients, it's because they have the money to buy the products London startups can build and there's lots of them.<p>> Lastly, the level of risk-aversion is generally higher in the UK than that in the States - the positive energy on the West Coast is _tangible_.<p>I can't speak for the west coast or the states but this varies greatly. We have things like the prince's trust, the Technology Strategy Board, SEEDA and innovateuk amongst others. If you pick the right niche to get into then people will practically throw money at you to solve their problems.  I will happily concede though that if you don't pick the right niche there is a level of risk aversion though but things like Seedcamp and HN London meetups are challenging that.",1334606362

Just costs you a bit more, and as a .NET developer, the only thing that still bugs me about .NET <i>are</i> the licensing fees for Windows - but if my business isn't making enough to pay for that then I have bigger problems.<p>As for deployment, if your .NET app doesn't have highly specialised dependencies you're likely to get away with a simple file copy deployment.  Even if you do need to install some frameworks/packages, offerings from e.g. ScaleXtreme (who allow you to manage both Windows and Linux servers from a single dashboard, private or in the cloud), make managing instances (via templates, scripts and integrated monitoring and patching) extremely simple.<p>This is great because I prefer writing my code in C# and running it under Windows but prefer Linux for the heavy-lifting (PostgreSQL, memcached, nginx for static content, etc.).  I do accept that not everybody knows how to use both platforms or would like to learn, however that is a matter of preference not practicality.

Actually there's lots of drama in ""interactive fiction"" games, but most of them aren't 30 hours long. I think it's possible for RTS's to have strong storylines, require skill and interactivity, and fancy graphics to boot. Although I'm not sure it's a strictly better medium for storytelling, at least it's different.<p>Edit - continuing:<p>Ico is fairly engaging and even intense in places, and it doesn't involve guns. Little flash games like N+ are actiony and you don't have to shoot people. I think a AAA high-budget game with N+ mechanics would be awesome. Darwinia is a good example of telling a story in a RTS.<p>Lots of games, even FPS games, involve stealth. So that's something you can do in an ""action oriented, modern, gun-based game"" other than killing hordes of random enemies. Another action-oriented mechanics is hand-to-hand combat, from realistic(ish) UFC fighting games to Ninja Gaiden or even Mad World.",1334606173

parties unrelated to me. This in addition to Lefty even of this
morning contacting some friends of mine I havent even talked to in
months and harassing them. Worst of all, Lefty has decided to
increase his harassment of my person by purchasing from my ex-
partner several home made pornographic photographs over ten years

harassment websites, <a href=""http://www.extinct-marsupial.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extinct-marsupial.org</a> . Here is a

Lefty Schlesinger made it public in order to harm and stalk my
family.
This not only illegal harassment and cyberstalking on Leftys part, it is civil
court actionable on several counts including willful invasion of
privacy and infliction of emotional distress. If you can stop your
husband Lefty, perhaps we can avoid involving the police and/or
civil attorneys in this matter. David needs your help, his actions
are not those of a sane and sober man.<p>The following WHOIS link has your and Davids home address on it,

stalking/harassment site with its stolen, unauthorized pornographic
photos.

3849039,comment,3848551,3848847,3,0,jenius,,,"Justifying design decisions is often extremely difficult. Although there is a science buried deep behind design decisions, unlike programming, design decisions are often very subjective and opinion-based in a debate, unless you have done A/B tests extensively before said debate. Most of the time, a designer will do something because 'it looks better' or 'it feels right', and redesign something because 'it looks bad'.<p>I can see what you are saying here, but at the same time you are proposing something very difficult for this designer. In my past, whenever I have been in a debate over design decisions, there is no objective criticism involved. Even if I've done extensive research beforehand and am citing what I imagine users will do and artistic theory that backs the decisions I made, it can always be disagreed with. ""Yeah that might be the case, but it doesn't look as good."" or ""No, users would do this instead, and want this."" Yes, surprisingly that flies in design debates.<p>I don't think that Kyro should attempt this unless he is going to run A/B tests so that he has actual data to back his reasons. Debate based solely upon opinion are fruitless, never-ending, and are bound to come up all the time in such a public and critical forum as hacker news.<p>That being said, I don't even think that he should be running A/B tests, and shouldn't need to provide any additional justification. Not only is this a ton of work for something he is doing for personal practice in his free time, but it's often a waste of time. A good designer must be trusted. You hire a designer if you like his work and trust his design decisions, not if you are going to nitpick and tell him to justify and test every shade of color he has used.<p>I think the most famous case of this happening is with with Douglas Bowman quitting at google to move to twitter as the lead visual designer. Mr. Bowman is quite clearly one of the best design and ux guys out there, and is widely respected. This article provides a lot of insight into his decision, and it came down to them questioning his decisions and asking him to prove everything, which was in the end a waste of time.<p><a href=""http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html</a>",1334606009

Lisps are pretty high up by this measure. They basically only have one abstraction feature: lambda expressions. Other languages have powerful abstraction features but more of them, like Haskell (lambdas, pattern matching, monadic do notation). And others have many but less powerful abstraction features (e.g. Java).<p>On the one hand, I certainly agree with you that more powerful abstractions make it easier to program. Once you've grokked the abstraction, you only need one brain ""chunk"" to deal with it freeing up your other chunks to work on the problem. If you need to juggle several different abstractions (e.g. wrap up your closure inside an object inside a class), you have fewer chunks to work on your problem.<p>On the other hand, people tend to have difficulty learning these higher abstractions in the first place. Alan Kay, in that quote, points out that young children (I think less than ~8 years old) have difficulty with the abstraction of parameterization. In particular they have trouble with mentally corresponding the placement of a parameter in a list with its role in the function. Named parameters make things a bit better, they help the children keep track of the role. Explicit variable assignment (imperative programming) makes it even easier. Of course, as less powerful abstractions, these styles don't tend to scale as well when working on more complex programs.<p>In general, I think people need help keeping track of <i>specifics</i> while working with higher abstractions until the abstractions become ""natural"" to them. Programming interfaces, including debugging interfaces, can help with this.<p>It's a bit of a paradox. When you truly understand an abstraction it tremendously improves the clarity of your programming experience. But without this understanding, abstractions can be a major hindrance.<p>You may be interested in further exploring ""point-free"" abstractions. It's kind of the next level up the abstraction ladder from explicitly assigned variables in imperative code, to lambda abstractions with parameters, to functions without the parameters at all.

So let's whip it back into shape. Let's gather all the open-source knowledge and applications we currently have, and connect everything in one decentralized open-source platform to enhance collaboration and connectivity. Let's give everyone a voice - and a vote - in the direction that open-source should be headed. Lets start right now.<p>Diaspora (http://diasporaproject.org/) is a decentralized social communication network. That can be our base to build on. From here we can aggregate and organize information and knowledge from places like Wikipedia and others, and provide an open forum in which to discuss and expand on what we have. This is how we can turn information into instruction, a key step in the spread of knowledge.<p>But what about motivation? What personal benefit would an individual person gain from helping out with an open-source community? Currently, there is no external motivation for open collaboration, and open-source is suffering because of it. What we need is to reward individual contribution to open-source, but how? Well, lets try something new.<p>Let's create an open source economy. Hear me out before you dismiss the idea. What is preventing the creation of an economic ecosystem that is tied to creation, rather than consumption? What if you were ""paid"" according to the value the open-source community places on your contributions, and could ""trade"" this value with other members of the community? This would allow everyday people to contribute with ideas, knowledge, art, music, and entertainment, and be ""paid"" every time another member of the community used (or improved upon) their contribution. You're individual ""worth"" would then be a representation of your relative value to the open-source community.<p>For open-source to really make a difference, we need an open-source community for everything. We can make this happen now. All we need is a base to build on. Who's willing to help me get started?",1334605716

We have basically no funding besides our own personal savings and a dream that we'd like to persue. When you're in that situation, you're forced to really get down and dirty and try to do everything yourself. Nobody will miraculously jump out and offer you a hand, so you're forced to learn everything and try new ways of entering the market by yourself. From each time we've failed a startup, we always learned something new. We took that experience and used it to build what we have today, Persona. It's like riding a bike, you keep falling and injuring yourself but eventually you learn. That's how we feel about Persona. We're confident enough that this is the app that's different from all the other times we've tried.<p>So back to the topic, because we've gone so far doing everything hands on ourselves, we wanted to try and get funding ourselves without having to rely on YC. We get that YC is a fantastic program and they have exactly the right connections to put you in the spotlight, but if we join YC now without trying ourselves the very last step (getting money to continue), we'll regret that decision for the rest of our lives.

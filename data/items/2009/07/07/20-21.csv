How will they know?""<p>Using it. Start with your friends, and if they like it, they will talk about it to their friends. There´s a lot of ways to make the user ""talk"". It´s not asking him like a favor, but, basically, regarding him. It´s better if to need your app, he MUST invite new users. It creates a powerful chain of humans.<p>This would be better said as, ""If you're not quite sure, don't be afraid to release. Blindly releasing for the sake of releasing is risky and stupid.""<p>Nope. I think it´s about really release as fast as possible, as long as your app can do the ""mainly"" think. It´s not even an beta, it´s a alpha, but if it works, it´s must be released.<p>What is this doing on this list? Worst advice ever. Better would be, ""Your app can succeed.""<p>Because newbies business men think that they will be successful by the end of the year. Don´t dream, stay focused and prepare to lose, a lot. It´s not a game where the victories depends of you and your guts, but rather luck and a lot of uncontrolled factors. The best advise ? Good luck !<p>This can easily be the opposite of #1, ""Build something people need and love."" You're unnecessarily restricting yourself to the relatively tiny population of things that interest you.<p>Nah ... there´s a trick part here. If you make something that you can REALLY use, so it´s will be MUCH, but really MUCH more easy to sell to others. If you any time tried to sell something, you should know that.<p>Such as...<p>Hum ... anything your mom ever have heard (even if it exists) could help. The point is to start something new, and then look for YOUR USERS needs ... not having the brilliant idea. Dont stick with examples and ideas, go for the reality and try to create anything your user need.<p>Not according to Markus Frind, founder of plentyoffish.com.<p>Maybe ... but if you are have something that don´t trows a lot of shit on the screen of the user, and even so that have money, your product is really for the win. Dont be afraid, if your app really help somebody, they will be happy to pay for it.<p>Such as...<p>Get one, listen to him, release, get ten, listen to them, release, get 100, listen to them, release, get 1000, listen to them, release ... remember, ""we are not on the software business, we are on the SHOWBUSINESS"". And, of course, believe on your work.<p>Sweat a little. Release shit too soon and shoot yourself in the foot. Development must be done with design in mind.<p>I agree.<p>But develop with scaling in mind. (Will you really have enough time to completely redesign your data base schema after 1000 users?)<p>Agree again with you here.<p>What if spending money is more time/cost effective? (Paying someone to do something that would have taken me 5 days to do.)<p>It works only if in this five days you can make more money then you have payed for. Therefore you are not spending, but earning.<p>Sorry by my poor english.",1247000309

It's design centers around a few specialized apps and the Internet which are both things the iPod touch does better.<p>So while I don't 100% agree with the author (a keyboard would be nice) his point is a good one.  The OLPC is a lousy product that only gets by because it's aimed at people who supposedly have no other choice.

In standard-definition encoding, it's even superior to modern proprietary codecs such as H.264:</i><p>Are you seriously this misinformed?<p>1.  Quicktime isn't a ""codec"", it's a video player.  There is no ""Quicktime codec"".<p>2.  H.264 isn't proprietary.<p>3.  Theora is roughly between MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 SP in potential efficiency; it's nowhere near VC-1 or H.264.  Right now it's worse than MPEG-2 because the encoder is so bad, but Thusnelda is working on fixing that.  The eventual goal is to become on par with FLV1 and similar formats; reaching more modern levels of compression will require a spec revision.<p>The purpose of Theora is to provide a patent-free video format, not to be the best out there in compression, since the two goals are basically contradictory.  Spreading lies like these are a great way to completely ruin any chance of Theora's adoption, because expectations will be set so high that the Theora developers will never be able to realistically reach them.  This is a disservice to Xiph in every way.<p>Despite the fact that the Theora specification is terrible and even their own developers admit it, they have one thing going their way: the quality of an encoder is far more important than the format itself.  In other words, a really good MPEG-2 encoder can give better output than a really bad H.264 encoder, for example.  A classic example of this is Quicktime's H.264 encoder, which is so bad that it is widely used across the industry as a marketing tool by competing encoder developers to demonstrate how good theirs is by comparison.<p>As such, it is possible for Theora to beat some of the lower-end H.264 encoders if they really work hard at it, even if H.264 as a whole is vastly better than Theora.  This is why Thusnelda is a big deal for Theora.<p>This is also why it's such a problem that people consider ""H.264"" or ""MPEG-2"" or ""JPEG"" to be single entities; the compression quality can vary <i>massively</i> between different encoders.  That's why I always cringe when someone posts, for example, an ""H.264 vs Theora"" comparison; they're really doing an ""X H.264 encoder vs Thusnelda"" comparison and generalizing it far beyond its meaning.",1246999886

In many cases you partition your sharded data in such a way that the majority of your queries are not distributed so that they can continue to leverage the relational model you had before, only performing a distributed query for more complex actions like reporting and such.<p>Also going back to the first place isn't really an option, shards usually come of a system that has grown, not ground up design.

And again, it's a long shot as with any startup.<p>My startup has offered 2% pre-dilution to a coder who will put ~200 hours into a project that already has about 800 hours on it.  So he's putting in around 20% of the code.  Dunno if that helps you, but that's what we're doing.",1246997752

Most of the money-losing firms would still have lost money even if they charged zero fees.<p>The real problem is simply that most VCs are lousy investors.  But it's not uncommon for most practitioners in a field to be bad at it.  Most artists are bad, for example.<p>The point where the VC business is broken is where LPs meet GPs.  Credulous LPs give money to incompetent GPs.  It's not the VC <i>model</i> that's broken, but the LPs' judgement.<p>Most LPs shouldn't be investing in VC.  They do it in imitation of LPs past who've made lots of money that way, like big university endowments and certain family funds, but they don't know what they're doing, choose badly, and end up losing their money.<p>A lot of them will probably pull back now, which will mean a lot of the worst performing VCs will disappear.

Rather than push back the release date, they released an implementation that works for many videos. The GStreamer backend is still under active development, and will eventually be merged to trunk.<p><i>leading to the tremendous irony of having video playback vastly slower than Flash.</i><p>Using the most recent version of Flash and Firefox, I can play high-definition Theora easily on my laptop, but even medium-resolution H.264 in Flash struggles to achieve real-time decoding.

They also give you the opportunity to get &#x27;real&#x27; questions from people who aren&#x27;t as close to the material as you are, almost like &#x27;customers&#x27;, so if you use a question like this in a lecture, it&#x27;s almost sure to capture the interest of students better than other textbook examples. While I don&#x27;t teach many courses, I&#x27;ve used examples derived from hybrid &#x27;real world&#x27; /  theoretical questions as examples to explain our products.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve surely spend time on questions that will never pay themselves back in such a way.

7169521,comment,7168936,7169299,33,0,nostrademons,,,"Full-stack dev that came up through the front-end ranks here - I&#x27;m in my early 30s and have been doing this in some form or another for 17 years.  I started with Perl and C CGI scripts, worked with Java Swing (on the desktop) for a while, had a brief foray into MFC, did a whole bunch of PHP in college, switched to Django/JQuery while working on my startup, and now use a whole bunch of Google-proprietary techniques along with the native browser APIs.<p>I&#x27;ve found that the best way to stay sane is to ignore the hype.  After having worked with a dozen or so technologies, I can say that knowing your preferred toolkit <i>well</i> matters a whole lot more than <i>which</i> toolkit you know.  Nowadays I usually tend to prefer whatever is native to the platform (vanilla JS for web, Java for Android, Objective C for iPhone), because it will perform better, there are fewer opportunities for bugs to creep in, and you can access more of the platform functionality without waiting for frameworks to catch up.<p>It was actually uTorrent (remember that?) that caused a major shift in my thinking: before that came out I was all like &quot;Yeah, frameworks!  Developer productivity!  I want to squeeze every inch of convenience out of my computer!&quot;, but then here was this program that was a native Win32 app, no MFC or Qt or Python or anything, and it blew the pants off the competition <i>because</i> it didn&#x27;t use a framework.  I didn&#x27;t want to deal with Win32 at the time, but Web 2.0 was just getting started, and within a couple years I was doing a startup with Javascript games, and I found that if I wanted acceptable framerates in a game I <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> use JQuery and had to learn the native browser APIs, and the difference between them was incredibly stark (this was pre-V8, when no browser shipped with a JIT, and I was getting about 2 fps with JQuery and about 15 with native browser APIs).  And once I&#x27;d used the native APIs for a bit, I found they weren&#x27;t actually that bad; they were more verbose and less consistent, but not in a way that seriously slowed me down.<p>I think it does take a certain amount of security and confidence in one&#x27;s own abilities to do this, because it definitely makes you uncool.  I&#x27;ve been in Hacker News threads where people are like &quot;No.  What the hell are you smoking?&quot; when I suggest that you might not need a JS framework.  But the folks who matter to me respect my abilities enough to pay me generously for them, and not staying up-to-date with the latest and greatest gives me time to cross-train in other fields like compilers, machine-learning, data analysis, scalability, UX design, management, and other skills that I&#x27;ve frankly found significantly more useful than yet another MVC framework.  If I need to use a framework I&#x27;ll learn it on the fly; I&#x27;ve done that for several projects, and (after I learned my first half-dozen MVC & web frameworks) it&#x27;s never taken me more than a week or two to become proficient in another one.",1391417394

There is a vast difference between the two. The privileges include meals, communication, and some other humane things. But the entire purpose of the unlawful combatant designation was to deny the legal status of POW altogether. This was done with disingenuous arguments denying the Taliban recognition as the government of Afghanistan, as well as denying satisfaction of other requirements under the Geneva Conventions that would require POW status. The Bush administration was adamant about denying Taliban captives POW status.<p>There is no requirement that unlawful combatants be released after hostilities are ended, nor has there ever been an offered picture of what it would mean for hostilities to end. Were these prisoners declared as POWs, they could never have their detainment and crimes reviewed, presided over, or decided by tribunals. That violates international law.",1391417367

We have over 400 complicated web app pages that need testing to make sure we haven&#x27;t broken any edge cases.<p>The learning curve is tough, the maintenance is tougher and the churn is terrible.

Yes, magic in programming can be dangerous, but keep in mind that magic always has a logical explanation. In this case, the magic turns out to be a pretty mundane case of metaprogramming. If a developer can&#x27;t understand how it might be possible to pattern match parameter identifiers in JavaScript, then I think AngularJS DI is the least of their worries.<p><i>Maybe you are some sort of Angular savant who agrees with all the assumptions the authors made.</i><p>I&#x27;ll take that as a compliment, but I&#x27;m just a regular guy who has pushed a few medium sized angular apps into production.

It&#x27;s an opinionated approach, but not inherently wrong.<p><i>of course we abstract things but you should use the simplest possible abstraction for the job.

Gulp looks great but depending on the amount of time you can spend on it, it&#x27;s best to wait for the ecosystem to mature (more plugins, more framework support, migration of existing Grunt plugins etc). I would give it another year or so because community migration can take time (backward compatibility, dependencies, endowment effect, etc).<p>The other thing that works for me is to adopt frameworks with a lower learning curve even it requires more manual plumbing.

Well, if we assume that prior to the coding camp Bob was a generic young liberal arts graduate, Bob&#x27;s employment prospects in 2014 are a) not that great and b) likely offer a salary in the $30k a year range.  $10k plus a few months of work plus opportunity cost strikes me as &quot;More than possibly worth it&quot; to secure an $80k a year job and the career trajectory that programmers have as opposed to the one that e.g. baristas or office managers have.",1391416341

7169432,comment,7168865,7169396,2,0,BWStearns,,,">> If you already have prior programming knowledge and know at least one programming language, joining this camp is silly and it doesn&#x27;t prove anything one way or another<p>I have to disagree here. If you taught yourself enough for what you needed at the time and never knew any other programmers then you face a huge impediment to learning. Every time you hit a wall where you know how to describe the problem to a human but not to google or stack overflow you can spend hours (notice I didn&#x27;t say waste) hunting down what is the proper way to describe the problem. While this can be extremely educational in the broad sense it can be slow in terms of actual progress towards being a better programmer since the overhead associated with troubleshooting/debugging is multiplied when it is most costly.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re spending 12+ hours a day writing code on average (in my program we did) for 12 hours a week, then you&#x27;re putting in a hair over a thousand hours of coding time. Assuming a 12 week semester, 2 semesters a year, and 4 years this comes out to about 10 hours per week of actual coding. This clearly isn&#x27;t the best student in a 4 year program&#x27;s work schedule, but it&#x27;s not unrealistic for an undergrad. It takes time to get situated with a given problem and into writing code, but if you&#x27;re essentially on a 12 week coding binge where you take breaks to sleep and eat then that context switching overhead is reduced. The productive hours of a 12 week bootcamp may seriously outpace the hypothetical student who spends that raw time over 4 years.",1391415408

I would hazard a guess (stats was never my strength) that 50% of new frameworks are a bad idea and/or complicate matters down the road.<p>> I think that as web development grows and matures, it will finally have multiple experts who need to work together and with each expert having no problem in catching up or using the latest paradigm in their area.<p>We&#x27;re there already.

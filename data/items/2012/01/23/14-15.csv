What is the difference to just paying them lower wages and thus selling your stuff for less Euros?<p>One important difference is in domestic contracts. Let's say you are an employee in a country that uses # as currency, and your current monthly wage is 1000#. You pay 500# of that every month for fixed contracts such as rent, health insurance, electricity, telephony, etc.<p>Now you are faced with two possible scenarios: A) There is CPI inflation of 10%. B) Your wages are cut by 10%.<p>In both scenarios, your nominal wages are down to 900#. But when you look at it more closely, there is a significant difference.<p>In scenario A, you still receive (nominal) 1000#. Of those, you pay 500# to your fixed contracts, and you use the remaining 500# for consumption goods, whose real value compared to before is now only 450#.<p>In scenario B, you receive (nominal) 900#. Of those, you pay 500# to your fixed contracts, and you have 400# remaining to buy consumption goods.<p>Clearly, inflation (scenario A) is better for you. Devaluation of the currency by 10% would be even better, because currency devaluation rarely punches through entirely to consumer prices: only imported goods are affected directly, after all.<p>Now you could argue that in the long run, those fixed contracts like rent will also be adjusted. But there is a huge difference in pressure and thus power between the scenarios: when your wages are decreased, you are immediately worse off as an employee, and it is up to you personally to try to get a better deal on the rent, forcing the landlord to decrease their rent in turn. In the case of inflation, however, it is up to the landlord to raise rents, something for which there are often significant legal hurdles.<p>Most employees probably don't think these scenarios through, but the gut reflex ends up being correct in this case: for employees, currency devaluation is better than nominal wage reduction.<p>(Of course, everything I've said changes for somebody who has significant nominal assets; but then, it would probably be incorrect to classify them as an employee.)",1327328501

It is clear that Germany must accept its fair share of the blame.<p>The irony is that from a social and moral perspective, one could argue that adjusting wages throughout the Eurozone is a good thing.

More important than colours is font size - make it BIG!

If you leave it to the end, people will be distracted for the rest of your presentation and that's much harder to fix at the end.<p>If the questions get too specific then simple say ""Can we take this offline afterwards or grab a beer later"" and move on.<p>For me the most important thing is to remember that the audience have taken there time to see you.

It has become universal wisdom that being a net exporter is the key.<p>America ran trade deficits during the fastest period of its growth, almost the entire 19th century. So how did we accumulate so much real wealth and production while running trade deficits?<p>Answer: because the profits being generated domestically outstripped the import imbalance.

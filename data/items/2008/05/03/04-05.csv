The fact that it sends me a plaintext email with my plaintext password is garbage.  And that monthly subscription reminder?  All garbage.",1209790552

180128,comment,179650,179650,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"This article is all around dumb. Whoever wrote it doesn't appear to understand either the laws of supply and demand, or the music industry. Or he's just denying to himself that his site, which is based on the CD industry, is about to go the way of the cassette tape.<p>Concerts are highly scalable. The Rolling Stones sell out one arena after another full of 50k+ people. Their ""A Bigger Bang"" tour grossed $558m in 147 concerts over about 2 years. That's far more than any artist ever made in 2 years off of CD sales.<p>And true, I guess they can't scale much beyond that, but any other musician can scale all the way up to it and none have.  But placing a limit of $558m on your income seems fine to me.",1209790149

The Daily Mail have done this before by stating the average kitchen worktop is no cleaner than a toilet seat:<p><a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=454841&in_page_id=1770"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.htm...</a><p>The fact is, toilet seats are cleaned regularly (at least every few weeks even in the most shoddy of households, I'd hope - but usually at least once a week) whereas keyboards are not. Most people's buttocks don't harbor germs either. It's not as if people defecate on the seat or rub their anus directly on it, whereas sweaty, dirty fingers can infect a keyboard in no time.<p>The toilet seat, therefore, is a weird comparison. At least compare the keyboard to a bath sponge, a washing up cloth, or something similar that's almost certainly going to harbor germs.",1209789503

Still, she insists she does not regret her \n  decision to stay in academia. “I like the freedom to \n  explore the things I care about,” she said.\n</code></pre>\nIt worries me how many people <i>do</i> take the easy option of heading off to ""chair warmer"" jobs at places like Google rather than work in lower-paid, but ultimately more rewarding, academic and research jobs. What's even more odd is how few people when exposed to the commercial world actually <i>return</i> to the academic world.<p>There's a lot of work to be done in the fields of computer science and computer engineering, and a lot of the people who could be making the breakthroughs are instead chasing the dollar. We can't blame them, but instead perhaps we should be looking for ways to ensure the cream of the crop have, at least, an appealing alternative in doing research.",1209789020

Visiting the home page (and not logged in) results in 34 http requests.  Roughly 1/3 are images, and the rest are javascript and css.  That many requests slows down all page loading, even when locally cached.  If I were facebook (the best I have is a parody site of facebook: <a href=""http://farcebook.codeirony.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://farcebook.codeirony.com/</a>), I would put all the css into 1 file, and all the js into 1 file.<p>The other part is that they have a ton of users.

Studies into this topic have already shown that the difference in prevalence of dyslexia between Italy and English-speaking countries rests in a lack of phonetic conformity in the English language and a strong phonetic conformity in Italian (that is, letters in Italian have fewer phonetic variants).",1209788647

There are numerous encryption schemes possible, but my biggest concern is integration with other sites' backends that will produce the masked email.

It can use a private key.<p>My main concern is harvesting the email address, meaning it needs to be just strong enough for spammers not to bother.<p>Any suggestions?<p>update: this is for machine consumption, not human.

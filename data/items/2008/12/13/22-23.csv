But my 'accounting' stuff isn't that interesting for 3rd parties; as I also said in the comments on my blog:\n""I get your concerns and need for a private key. Also a key based on a combination of username and password would be the simplest solution to this problem. For me the encryption isn’t that of a big issue since 3rd parties viewing my files aren’t going to get anything out of it that should do damage to me. Of course, when you store sensitive data on it, you should also invest in some security on your part (like the mentioned TrueCrypt).""",1229208567

397031,comment,396596,396811,0,0,davidw,,,"> Everyday life in France for the average person is much like it is for the average person in the US, just a little poorer.<p>That is not my experience in Italy.  To take an example near and dear to that country, the average Italian eats much better than the average American.  Indeed, the basic, raw ingredients you find in supermarkets are far better than what you get in the US.<p>But it's not just that... I find that the relationships between people are genuinely a bit better in Italy than in the US.  Perhaps one of the effects of all that ""stasis"" (jobs for life, people less willing to move around for jobs) is that people really get to know one another.  I have several friends in Italy I've known for 13 years, but barely anyone in the US I've known for that long.  I've heard some people say this is also true of small towns in the US, but I've never lived in one so I don't know how to compare it to Italy.<p>In short, in economic terms, you're correct, but the broader picture is more complex, and doesn't favor the US 100%.  That's not to say that one is necessarily better... after many years of both, I guess I have a more nuanced view.  I wouldn't hesitate to say the US is better for founding startups, but if you're just Joe Schmoe, life can be nice in Europe, too, even if you don't have an SUV and a fancy television set like your American equivalent.",1229208056

397018,comment,394609,396949,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<i>you are creating a false dichotomy between committing atrocities and losing the war</i><p>No. I defined war as something which continues until one side quits. I furthermore identified that you believe that in certain cases it is more desirable to quit than to prosecute a war in certain formats (such as the use of nuclear weapons) I observed that every war has had atrocities on both sides. Finally I observed that we all live in a world where we enjoy various freedoms, cultures, and science because of a lot of previous wars -- wars in which your norms (or any other norms for that matter) were disregarded to some degree.<p>It follows that there are always moral reasons for not fighting and that we would be living in caves had we all felt the way you describe. Therefore, if you believe that civilization is more important than your own petty opinions you're compelled to make muddy, ugly moral choices when it comes to the use of force. I made no statement that atrocities are necessary to win a war. I <i>will</i> say that war is about making the other side quit. Most often you end up doing something they really, really don't like in order to reach this point. Fire bombing Dresden, dropping the A-bomb on Japan, etc. -- all drew WWII to an end quicker and promoted the greater good. <i>You</i> may participate in a war and commit no atrocities at all. But by participating, you can be sure you are supporting actions and behaviors that on a clear, sane afternoon you would never do. That's why war sucks so much -- it drags us all down to the lowest denominator: survival.<p>I'm not getting into current events. They are emotionally laden and simply confuse the issues. I will point out that non-state actors acting in non-standard formats have been with us for a long time. They're usually shot on the battlefield or very close to it by means of summary courts martial. I'll also point out that the word ""war"" is overused to the point to be meaningless. We have a war on terror, a war on poverty (which I believe might involve shooting poor people?), a war on drugs, a war on pollution, etc. Let's take war as something where one side can clearly quit, which ties back to our previous definition. Under that definition, the current war on terror is not really a war at all, since ""terror"" cannot surrender to anybody.",1229207093

I'm willing to believe I'm just dumb though ;)<p>(One comment on the basic approach: many languages that use green threads don't scale well in multicore due to issues like lock contention or IO wait.)<p>Preemptive multithreading still leaves the OS with final control (for your ""miserly time slice"" comment. Which I find very problematic for things like say Loopt where for example you will spend more time waiting for a GPS fix or on network latency than actual computation time...)<p>How does a ""virtual"" exception handler become cheaper than any other implementation? It seems the work required is roughly the same (catch dangerous situations, jump to the correct handler).<p>I suppose there would be lower context switching costs with the use of green threads (skip a user->kernel->user transition), but I suspect it would require programming without any synchronous anything (all IO would have to be asynchronous probably in order for threads to ""yield"" back to the virtual task scheduler).<p>(Sorry kind of rambling, I'm pretty much curious about every sentence you wrote ;) I don't think traditional multiproccessing models really pose any <i>control</i> problems that are solved by running a single user thread that does its own scheduling IMO)",1229206608

397011,comment,392036,392036,0,0,Arancaytar,,,"I've tried to play build the idea cubicle67 mentioned to use relative mutations instead of absolute ones. What I've implemented is a function that does not limit the change at all, but simple makes it more likely to be small and less likely to be large.<p>The new value becomes either (MAX - current) * P or current * P (50% chance on each), where P is the product of two random variables between [-1, 1]. I'm not sure how that is distributed (been a while since that statistics course), but it obviously favors numbers closer to 0.<p>This optimization looks rather efficient, as the same image seems to get about 67% more beneficient mutations in the same interval of generations.<p>Another change I would like to implement (but haven't yet) is a low chance of changing multiple values at once, which may eventually escape from a ""dead end"".<p>The best improvement of all would be to allow users to airbrush ""priority"" onto different regions, which then get weighted in the fitness score.

397002,comment,396218,396629,0,0,litewulf,,,"(disclaimer: I've only used a cellphone and never made one.)<p>I think the problem is much deeper than you'd think. Its very difficult to know the battery cost of an action (some CPU ops take less power iirc), and also I'd imagine that certain execution patterns would be more efficient than others. For example, GPS fixes have some caching involved, so two applications with very similar GPS access patterns could possibly halve their power consumption by simply being scheduled back to back.<p>Further, I'm not sure whether CPU is really the killer. CPU drain affects latency, which is bad, but for example keeping the radio running (data access), or keeping say accelerometer sensors on (perhaps the generate constant interrupts that interfere with the system's low power state.)<p>I have an Android phone, and there is some screen that displays uptime statistics and also ""time awake"" which I <i>think</i> is an indicator for the proportion of the time the CPU is maxed, and even when I run top on my phone I have NO idea what it means or whats at fault. This is partly a tools problem and also partly a problem of some things being products of some particular interleaving.<p>Another thought is that you have to be very careful about what you measure. Even in the desktop, lots of IO will probably show up as IO waits in your process, so latency is suffering even though the process itself is unrunnable (and worse, the blame would fall on the kernel's IO scheduler probably, thus hiding the blame further. And what if you want to write something but your system is already busy? Who's at fault, the other guys in the IO queue? What if all the apps in the queue are being nice and its just say a DB engine with raw disk access? Complicated complicated stuff.)",1229205954

Only a small subset of the skills that I'm marketing right now did I learn in college.<p>Furthermore, I'm doing better than a lot of my peers. Your numbers are suspect at best.<p>$25k x 4 = $100,000 opportunity cost for college.<p>$20k x 4 = $100,000 college debt load (if you're lucky).<p>8% over 10 years for interest payments = ~$45k.<p>$245,000 total cost to go to school.<p>If you figure a $55,000 starting salary after school and do $8,000 yearly increases because you're clever and smart, it will take you 4 complete years to make up the difference AND that's still assuming the same clever and smart person has been working without a degree for 8 years and is still only making $25k/year. (For the curious, the two cross path around $350k total salary earned)<p>ALSO, that same clever and smart person could have been accruing a whole host of assets with the money they were making every year and could be well north of net worth $250k by the time the college grad gets to net worth $0. That clever and smart person with 8 years experience in the real world could use those assets to do all sorts of things our college grad is still going to have to wait some years to do.<p>The financial benefit for a smart person going to school and not going to school, in my mind, is irrelevant. When you factor in opportunity cost and debt, that same smart person will have grayed the difference between a college grad and a non-college grad by the time the college grad gets to net worth $0.<p>And as college tuition inflation continues to outpace all other expenditures in society, I would move more firmly into the drop-out camp.",1319561962

Symfony2 is modular and easily used for exactly what you need.<p>-CakePHP is stuck in the past; any framework that is intentionally made compatible with versions earlier than PHP 5.3 is short-changing its users by not taking advantage of exactly what the language is capable of doing.<p>It has no real redeeming features.

3154710,comment,3153722,3153840,1,0,lsc,,,"the 18-22 years are periods of extreme income growth for anyone ending up in a skilled field.   I didn't go to school and eh, my income had a similar curve during those years.  Going from unskilled to skilled is going to make your income curve look pretty goddamn dramatic for a few years, no matter how you go from unskilled to skilled.<p>The thing is, a degree no longer guarantees a skilled job.  I know a lot of smart and well-educated people working retail right now.<p>Also: do not underestimate middle-class connections.   As a kid I mowed lawns to make money.   Middle class neighborhood in the central valley.  One of the yards I dealt with belonged to the sister of an industry notable;   it got me an interview. (it wasn't my first SysAdmin/Programming gig, but it certainly was the most impressive one. For years after, if I really desperately wanted a job I'd use that guy as a reference, and I'd get the gig.)    During the depths of the dot-com crash?  I cracked under the stress of being the only sysadmin to not get laid off, and quit without another job lined up.   My dad, a mid-level IT manager at a university got me an interview with someone who had worked for him as a student who had later done well with his own company.<p>Those two jobs, I think, made the difference between a pretty good career and a sputtering, so-so career.   And really, if I didn't have a dad and a stepdad in the field and if I didn't have computers, compilers, books and people who knew how to use such things around the house from the age of four onward, well, I'd probably have ended up with a semi-skilled career.  Whatever you want to call this situation I was born into has helped my career far more than any amount of schooling could.<p>That said, I think you are likely right about the cultural aspects of College;  No matter how rich I become, I suspect I will never fully relate as 'middle class'  even though I mostly am.   My social skills have suffered quite a lot; I'm probably four years behind my peers who went to school in that area. The thing is, high school is such a horrible experience it leaves you overly misanthropic and cynical.  I think College softens this outlook for most people-  it took some time for me to soften.<p>But income-wise?  I don't think a degree would have bought me anything.   I mean, it might be different now, just because the job market is so shit, and going to school for four years is lightyears better than being unemployed or working retail for four years; but I just wanted to say that school is not what gets you that 30+% salary increase for four years;  going from being an unskilled worker to a skilled worker is what does it.<p>It's also possible that people born without at least middle-class connections can gain those connections by going to college;  that could dramatically contribute to the value you take from a degree.",1319560838

Here's how to deal with this question.<p>1) Design a nice DSL to express whatever it is you want your users to be able to command.<p>2) When you build the GUI, have all the gestures correspond to a particular DSL expression.<p>3) Add a shell where the user can type arbitrary expressions in your DSL (and for that matter, load files with DSL commands and execute them).<p>You're done.  People who want a GUI have one, people who want a CLI have one, and there's a nice clean upgrade path from the GUI to the CLI.  In fact, that's where this approach really shines: when a GUI user decides he needs to automate something, you can give him a single clear expression to type for each gesture he's used to making, and at first he'll probably just memorize those and use your product in exactly the same way with the CLI as with the GUI.  Once he gets used to the CLI itself, he'll probably start tweaking the basic expressions you gave him and eventually feel comfortable enough to write his own.  It's a nice security blanket for people who are basically learning to program to have a set of magic spells they're confident they can use no matter what.",1319560811

There's a reason PHP is big and Symfony is small - only a fraction of the PHP users have needs that are met by symfony and have the time/effort to learn symfony in the first place.<p>There's actually probably multiple reasons, but that's the easiest one off the top of my head.  PHP's used in all kinds of web places that Ruby isn't, mostly because Ruby's not a great fit in those places.<p>Hello <?=$name;?> it's <?=date(""h:i:s"");?>.<p>I've never met anyone who does 'ruby pages' and drops ruby in to various files as needed for small stuff.  You can do that and many people do with PHP.<p>All web work I've ever seen done in Ruby uses Rails or Sinatra or some framework.  Only a portion of web work I've seen in PHP uses any community framework.  This is just the way it is.<p>Your point on ecosystems is correct - the ZF system is probably the closest modern one out there (indeed, ZF should have been called PEAR2 years ago) - Symfony uses bits of ZF libraries as needed.  But because of the naming, people think you use all of it.  Because Rails was/is the dominant web framework in Ruby for so long, it feeds on itself, and people end up writing cool stuff for Rails, and more people use it because of the cool stuff, lather rinse repeat.  The cool symfony stuff mostly can't be used outside symfony, CI stuff not usable outside CI, etc.<p>There's some cool stuff in Grails I use - it's not possible in PHP (maybe in the future if the language changes) so I use Grails when need be (or when I feel like it).  No amount of libraries/frameworks in PHP will make up for the missing language features, and this is the heart of your last paragraph (which I agree with).  I still use PHP for a lot of stuff, but have expanded out to other tools that fit other use cases better.<p>I do wish I'd see other camps being as broadminded as they exhort PHP users to be, though.  By and large, there's stil loads of people that try to do all their projects in Rails, or J2EE, or .NET, or Django, or whatever.  PHP's got its place, and sometimes really is the best choice for a project.  Ultimately, there's still loads of fanboys out there in all camps.  :/",1319558952

My hunch is that this partly due to a very busy user base and partly due to language barriers.<p>- I tried using Tout to do this but in the end, I didn't see any benefit over GMail's canned responses.<p>- I actually called about 1 out of 3 new users (I ask for their phone number at signup).

Thermostats are fine as-is: they could use a new UX, but do you really want to pay $249 (plus a $120 install fee) for that touch-up?<p>Here's why this thing will sell like gangbusters, though: it's aesthetically appealing. Homebuilders put aesthetically-appealing items in their new homes.<p>When you're purchasing a house for six figures, are you really nitpicking a $375 item? No--you're too worried about the flooring or the insulation or the plumbing or ceiling support or any other number of things. You'll glance at the thermostat, smile, then remember that you need to pull out some code-violating wiring. Then you're off again.<p>I predict a hit, but not in the B2C way many people are thinking about. People will implicitly pay for this thermostat in new homes, but they won't explicitly go out of their way to upgrade old thermostats.",1319558492

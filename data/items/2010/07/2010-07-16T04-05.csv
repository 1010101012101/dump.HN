It might boost your productivity, too.<p>2) Health: Use a nutrient calculator for a week and calculate if your typical diet is malnourished in Vitamin A,B1,B2,B3,B4,B5,B6,B9,B12,C,D,E,Calcium,Zinc,Iron,Magnesium,or Manganese and you are eating enough complete proteins that have all essential amino acids.<p>3) Thoughts: Eliminate negative thought cycles. Everyone gets stuck in them, they are basically feedback loops you need to cut. The fastest way to do this IMO is to learn any rudimentary meditation techniques and take a serotogenic such as Mescaline, 2c-i, Psylocibin, or Prozac\SSRIs.
The simplest mediation technique is to pick something such as the sensation of breathing through your nose to focus your attention on. Then when you notice yourself having a thought, simply acknowledge its existence without assigning negative or positive value to it (which we all normally do) and return your focus to the sensation of breathing through your nose (or whatever sensation or image you chose to focus on). In a meditative experience you're basically supposed to have the slight sensation of being an observer in you're own body, notice\gain-awareness of the type of thoughts you have everyday, and realize you have complete control over it and can actually think about anything you want.",1279254986

There are several different purely biological things that have been identified as root causes of depression: chronic illnesses, inflammation, nutritional imbalances, alcohol abuse, etc. These alone probably account for more than half of all cases of depression. (IIRC just inflammation is thought to account for 30% of cases.)<p>Similarly, there are many more lifestyle choices that clearly contribute: stressful work/family situation, lack of exercise, poor diet, poor social life, chronic sleep deprivation, etc.<p>Certainly there are individuals who are doing everything right and still end up suffering from a bout of depression that lasts more than two years even with therapy. However, these are fairly rare, as in almost certainly less than 5%.<p>As for treating the symptoms, it's not pointless but it can be extremely damaging. It can lead to more more severe mental illness (bipolar, schizophrenia), chronic depression, psychosis, suicide, violent behavior, sexual disfunction, etc.<p>There definitely are times when drugs are appropriate. But telling someone who has had suicidal ideations to look into drugs as a first line treatment is extremely irresponsible. It's like telling a 13 year old kid with a pimple to look into accutane.",1279253930

It should have been in the first version of C++, it should have been treated like a primitive type (even if it isn't), and they should have said ""thou shalt use this type for your strings"".

The problem is it conflated <i>access control</i> with <i>lifetime</i>.

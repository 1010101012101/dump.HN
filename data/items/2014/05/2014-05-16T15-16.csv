7756128,comment,7755182,7755938,5,0,shas3,,,"I think the problem with Modi, like extreme politicians (e.g. Le Pen in France or the Tea Party) in other democracies is that some of his utterances are contradictory to Enlightenment humanist ideals. It remains to be seen if the subset of his views that can be considered to be extreme are just rhetoric or if he intends to act on them. Historically, such politicians resemble the nationalistic polities of pre-1945 Europe and post-colonial South America.<p>The bright side about India is that its sheer diversity and the existence of regional leaders (who do not belong to Modi&#x27;s party) serve as checks and balances. As an example, regional parties organized on linguistic and non-traditional ideologies (communists, anarchists, etc.) basis have captured close to 140 seats in the parliament, including clean-sweeps in several States such as Tamil Nadu (population ~70 million), Odisha (population ~40 million), Seemandhra/Telangana (population ~85 million), and West Bengal (population ~90 million).",1400255696

To quote:<p>&quot;One reason why the inquiries into the riots were inconclusive is that a great deal of evidence was lost or wilfully destroyed. And if the facts in 2002 are murky, so are Mr Modi’s views now. He could put the pogroms behind him by explaining what happened and apologising. Yet he refuses to answer questions about them. In a rare comment last year he said he regretted Muslims’ suffering as he would that of a puppy run over by a car. Amid the uproar, he said he meant only that Hindus care about all life. Muslims—and chauvinist Hindus—heard a different message. Unlike other BJP leaders, Mr Modi has refused to wear a Muslim skullcap and failed to condemn riots in Uttar Pradesh in 2013 when most of the victims were Muslim.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21600106-he-will-probably-become-indias-next-prime-minister-does-not-mean-he-should-be-can-anyone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21600106-he-will-proba...</a>",1400255583

I remember when I was looking at his site I was seeing various articles around math and programming, and then articles about things like &quot;2 girls 1 cup&quot;. The breadth of articles completely threw me off. He seemed to have this unfocused interest in EVERYTHING. After looking over everything I could I had no idea how we&#x27;d be able to use him, but I was really interested in talking with him.<p>I went into the call expecting a lot of tangents about various topics he was passionate about and thinking I&#x27;d constantly have to refocus the conversation. Instead the conversation was pretty boring and not really going anywhere. He had breadth, but the depth was not there. At least not for the things I brought up. I couldn&#x27;t understand how someone who seemed to be interested in everything could have no real interest in anything.<p>For the last couple of minutes we talked about his site, and how he maintains/updates it. He finally seemed to light up, and we hit on something he was really interested in talking about. The basics of the site looked like it was just a couple of scripts, a lot of static text files and some emacs. The setup might have been impressive in the mid-to-early 90&#x27;s, but it wasn&#x27;t relevant to anything we would have wanted/needed.<p>The call lasted maybe 20 minutes, and then we wrapped it up. Every topic, other than talking about his site, was a dead-end. My internal feedback at the end was: &quot;No! Maybe... if we were trying to hire encyclopedia writers&quot;.<p>I think his main problem with interviews is that his real-life personality doesn&#x27;t even come close to his online personality.

This &#x27;75 article starting on page 5 <a href=""http://tech.mit.edu/V95/PDF/V95-N11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.mit.edu/V95/PDF/V95-N11.pdf</a> covers &#x27;62-&#x27;72, but the data I looked at went quite a bit further.  If you&#x27;re really interested I can try harder.<p>Note that you should throw out results from the &#x27;50s and a bit further, when science and especially math education was poorer and MIT had to accept and weed out students.  If one was really serious about this, you&#x27;d have to find the transition to when they could send acceptances to students they were quite sure could do the work, which had long been the case when I was got in in &#x27;79.<p>Can&#x27;t say anything based on data about this century; do wonder why they stopped releasing them, but there are reasons that wouldn&#x27;t touch on grade inflation <i>per se</i>, e.g. the dot.com crash resulted in a great discontinuity for the EECS, which lost more than half its students, after having 40% of them for decades.  That resulted in the panic which replaced SICP/6.001 with <i>harder</i> introductory courses (it&#x27;s even less a place where a pure CS type can slide by on two pure EE courses after the first required course), and it was some time before EECS enrollments returned (and not just at MIT, e.g. Stanford experienced this).<p>Hmmm, I&#x27;m not at all sure what that period might have done to the outside of EECS student body, but I could see many mathematically strong students simply not going to MIT, and my source on what&#x27;s going on, who would definitely know in at least the School of Engineering, hasn&#x27;t mentioned any grade inflation problems, I&#x27;ll ask if that&#x27;s changed.<p>There&#x27;s also one discontinuity before this century, when a professional admissions director actually followed the faculty&#x27;s official guidelines/rules/whatever on who to admit.

(2004-214). If  they had the power to twist Supreme court&#x27;s arm (appointment of judges etc), they would have most certainly done that, and influenced the outcome.<p>(b) The Government at the Center  (2004-2014) has had at its disposal the main investigative body of the country (CBI) to do any arm-twisting against Modi.<p>(c)Despite this, and despite intense media scrutiny in India, if the Supreme Court- the highest court in India- has given Modi a clean chit on his involvement in the riots, then sufficient respect has to accorded to the same. It is significantly way,way,WAY more authoritative than any wannabe-investigative journalists airing their opinions non-stop on television or highly-viewed blog articles.

But first of all I&#x27;d argue that &#x27;giving a shit&#x27; in itself is a skill. We are, to a large degree, <i>taught</i> to be nice. Watching the average eight-year-old in a school yard is a clear example of that. They&#x27;re practically psychopathic: developed enough to understand the concept of &#x27;the other&#x27;, but they haven&#x27;t necessarily learned how to empathize.<p>I suspect there&#x27;s a strong correlation between being socially outcast or awkward (whether biological, developmental or contextual in nature) and taking up programming and computers as a hobby. For me that was the case, and for most geeks I know it was too. In fact, the very definition of a nerd is someone who focuses unusually a lot on one thing, at the detriment of other things (usually social).<p>Plus, it&#x27;s a relatively recent development that &#x27;social&#x27; kids are also into computers, on account of wanting to make games, or emulating &#x27;skater geeks&#x27; like Kevin Rose. I still remember that it was rather &#x27;uncool&#x27; to be in chat rooms, for example. Or reddit being the nerd version of digg.<p>And finally, people have a tendency to conform their views to their experiences (more than the other way around, I suspect). So it kind of makes sense that a person with few friends, or a history of no partners, will conclude that &#x27;people are shit&#x27;. Misanthropy is usually not innate. I&#x27;ve met a shocking amount of people who are eerily similar in their deeply negative view of society with no real experience of friendship.

When interacting socially, results can be difficult to observe, especially when you don&#x27;t know what to look for, and often can be time delayed. It&#x27;s also virtually impossible to test a specific behavior in isolation, which makes it difficult to detect what specific thing might cause you to be perceived negatively.

(Some people recover in their 20s, because a 20% social deficit is catastrophic at 20 but not at 40-- being &quot;socially 16&quot; at 20 is devastating, but at 40, it means you&#x27;re socially 32, which is not a big deal-- but some don&#x27;t). You also spend more time than most people in intense states, which makes you more creative. So bipolar people have a paradoxical age-skew where they seem socially younger but, in some critical ways (creative maturity, ethical insight) tend to be substantially older and more experienced, because they&#x27;ve spent more time at extremes.<p>From this, there&#x27;s a tendency (out of resentment?) for people with BP to discount the experiences and skills of normal people as trivial &quot;small talk&quot; and turn emotional and ethical extremity (&quot;I&#x27;ve <i>really</i> experienced life&quot;) into a virtue.<p>Bipolar, I&#x27;m convinced, is a different thing from being manic-depressive (which would, in 2014, be called <i>hypo</i>manic-depressive if the term were still used; but to save keystrokes I&#x27;ll use &quot;manic&quot; even though modern psychiatry only uses &quot;mania&quot; for extreme highs that even most bipolar people never get.) Manic-depressive is present pathology, a symptom profile that few bipolar people have <i>all</i> the time. On the other hand, bipolar (as I&#x27;d define it) is a type of mind (creative, judgmental, ethically rigid) that has advantages (if the manic-depressive symptoms are contained) and drawbacks, but that never goes away, even if the manic-depressive symptoms remit. Well-treated bipolar people tend (contrary to stereotype) to be unusually conscientious, loyal, and self-aware. The flip side of it is a sort of extreme moral mysophobia.<p>It actually makes sense. If you&#x27;re bipolar, little things have gigantic consequences. A night of heavy drinking can have you suicidally depressed for a week. Simple excitement about an intellectual interest can become socially harmful (you don&#x27;t realize that others don&#x27;t share the interest). If you live in a world where you&#x27;re punished (by internal and external causes) severely for small mistakes, you tend to become intolerant of others who get away with much more.",1400254368

7755981,comment,7755090,7755090,1,0,draker,,,"I had a similar idea a few months ago when I was looking to do some volunteer work. Rather than volunteering at a soup kitchen, or other &quot;unskilled&quot; task I wanted to find an organization where I could volunteer my knowledge of business development, marketing and web dev.<p>My first thought was to look at websites such as <a href=""http://www.volunteermatch.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.volunteermatch.org/</a> . What I found was that the organizations typically requested website redesigns (often using wordpress as the backend) and help with social media management. The time commitment of these opportunities were as you stated above, longer term requiring a few months. The scope of work provided was often inadequate and would require you to contact the organization for details.<p>Solution:<p>Create a guide on how to assess requirements and create a proper scope of work for projects, the organization seeking volunteers would submit this as part of their application[1]. Then have a volunteer that would make an appointment to speak with the organization and refine this SOW into a workable project.<p>Once the project was accepted and requirements laid out; open the opportunity for contributors to offer their time and create a core team to start the project. For website redesign/management use a common codebase that could be reused for projects which would reduce the on-boarding process. This would also allow general documentation and training materials to be created so the management of the website could be transitioned to a full-time volunteer/employee of the organization.<p>Once the common core was developed and a repo created, issues/tasks would be created and open for contribution which would give devs willing to volunteer a few hours some opportunities to contribute.<p>I think a handful of well written guides for marketing, social media management, front-end/backend documentation and possibly even basic web design tutorials would go a long way towards improving organizations.

If I were to hire a programmer to work for me in a team context, the better choice from a business perspective, often, would be to hire the less-competent but socially-skilled.<p>But that sucks. Because the best way a socially awkward or socially underdeveloped individual will learn the very essential skill of being more social is through acceptance, a safe environment, and constructive feedback.<p>Furthermore, it&#x27;s often not the real problem. A big problem in almost all companies I&#x27;ve worked for is that the managers (who usually are very socially capable non-geeks) were just not skilled at dealing with their developers. And in my opinion that&#x27;s a core element of their job, to learn how to handle introverts or those less skilled in the social things.<p>Some of the developers I&#x27;ve worked with were very socially awkward, but if you figured out how to talk to them, they had no trouble communicating what needed to be communicated. To a degree, I think the ones who are socially skilled should use their strength to help those who are not. And if you&#x27;re a manager, I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re partly paid to do exactly that.",1400254192

And they were told it was good design because it was MVC, which is an acronym that smart people talked about long ago, so it must be good. And they were told they were being saved from those <i>other</i> developers who have the gall to do things differently!<p>I cannot overstate the appeal of a prescribed architecture. This removes some of the essential anxiety a newer developer has when building things by narrowing the available choices. Rather than fret about <i>where</i> to put things, and how much objects should do, they have two neat categories to choose from. The problem is a novice/intermediate dev often knows they should be thinking about the design, but they don&#x27;t know where to put things, so they waffle about things rather than just putting it somewhere and trusting themselves to fix it when they&#x27;re wrong.<p>Combine a prescribed architecture with a relentless marketing campaign that repeatedly tells developers exactly what they want to hear: &quot;blog in 15 minutes!&quot;, &quot;design is wankery, just use the framework!&quot;, &quot;testing just isn&#x27;t worth it, it&#x27;s too hard&quot;.<p>This is anti-intellectualism. It advocates ignoring software engineering principles established over the past few decades, and ignoring design feedback in the name of pragmatism.<p>Don&#x27;t entrust your skills to a crappy framework.

Agreed!<p>I just think a lot of what we call social skills really comes down to, frankly, giving a shit about the person in front of you.<p>For exceptionally smart people sometimes this is hard.<p>Interacting with average people can be mind numbing. I mean the average person is.. well, average. But I think 90% of social skills is finding a way to be interested in the people around you. Finding what&#x27;s interesting about them. As annoying as the phrase is, I think &quot;if you&#x27;re bored than you&#x27;re boring&quot; is pretty much true.<p>Charismatic people don&#x27;t have some fundamental gift, for the most part, charismatic people are charismatic because they seem to find a way to be <i>interested</i> in all the people around them. Or at least they can fake it.<p>Sometimes I think about 18 year old me versus 28 year old me. 18 year old me was undeniably smart, but shy and awkward. 28 year old me is (reasonably) socially skilled. The only particular difference between the two is 18 year old me only really wanted to talk about myself, or things I liked. 18 year old me was a total fucking narcissist. 28 year old me tries to figure out what other people are about, and engage them on their terms. It sounds small, but actually caring about other people is a thing some people have to learn, and it makes most social situations about 200% more interesting.",1400253504

Shared-nothing is certainly a good architectural goal, and there are many types of distributed systems where it is both highly desirable and achievable. On the other hand, there are many distributed systems (and parallel systems) where coordination is strictly necessary.<p>Think about implementing something like the TPC-C load on a distributed database. Many parts of that load can be done sharded, with a shared-nothing model. Other parts need some level of coordination, and some need true serializability (which requires significant coordination). The pieces that can be built on shared-nothing primitives should be built on shared-nothing primitives. However, it&#x27;s not useful to pretend that the pieces that require coordination simply don&#x27;t exist.<p>Similarly, immutability is a good goal. An append-only log of immutable data items is often a very good mental model, and frequently a good implementation model, for distributed databases.

But right now we usually meticulously write the view drawing and mouse tracking code by hand, without a lot of help from the system. (That&#x27;s something I consider a high art form, which I enjoy diong, so I&#x27;d probably be horrified and out of a job it it were too easy! ;)<p>I think Ben Shneiderman&#x27;s term &quot;direct manipulation&quot; describes the style of user interface that Alan Kay was getting at -- or at least DM has to deal with a lot of the same problems: &quot;continuous representation of objects of interest, and rapid, reversible, incremental actions and feedback&quot; according to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_manipulation_interface"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_manipulation_interface</a> ...<p>By that I mean DM user interface programming could benefit from some kind of automatic inverter, but usually it&#x27;s just implemented in an ad-hoc manner, usually by input tracking code in the view.<p>I think the way Smalltalk and Self/Morphic use reflection to present editable user interfaces to objects is another example of a two-way mapping between projecting the view on the screen, and editing the model via user input. Booleans whose values you can toggle, numbers whose values you can drag up and down, color pickers and things like that are all fine and good, but for many properties it has to fall back to standard widgets that don&#x27;t know much about the semantics of the data they&#x27;re viewing or editing.<p>I had the opportunity to play around with Sk8 when I was at Kaleida. That certainly let you drill down, see and modify everything there was in the system, and it was totally prototype based! Plus it had cool looking windows with neat shapes, which I like! ;)<p>I&#x27;m curious about what Kay meant by &quot;projection&quot;, and what successful examples there are of automatic bi-directional mapping, and powerful user composition. I take it that projection is the problem that you lose dimensions and have to hide information by flattening the structure out onto the screen (via a 3d projection or scaling or filtering or whatever infovis technique you&#x27;re using), and there&#x27;s no visible place to click or affordance to edit some every property of an object (or you have to build scaffolding in the form of clumsy indirect manipulation techniques like browsers, outliners and pop-up menus).",1400253087

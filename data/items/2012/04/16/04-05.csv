3845977,comment,3844302,3845030,2,0,kamaal,,,"Trusting artificial intelligence to make up for human stupidity doesn't look like a very good idea to me.<p>ASI is supposed to work in exceptional scenarios where you would have ended up making a mistake but wouldn't want to be reminded of. And that is supposed to be in rare scenarios.<p>Now if you make exception the norm and expect tools to make up for bad practices then its not going to help.<p>And this is why I think Python's forced indentation is in some way bad. Because it makes the code from a bad and good programmer both look same. And merely forcing code indentation won't magically transmogrify a bad programmer to a good programmer. There are many things to good programming and indentation is just one of them. Worse it will make both's code look the same.<p>Forgiving or masking or making bad practices look good doesn't help on the longer run. It only encourages such behavior. I am sure bad programmers can slip in easily into these communities than else where, because they are difficult to flush out and their mistakes are often forgiven or made look good.",1334552336

Heck I could probably write browser extension in a day that does this automatically.<p>> indexed and merged with other info Google may have<p>Facebook has your personal connections and a subset of your browser history, what can Google add to that to make it even creepier?<p>FYI: Bing incorporates the Facebook data, they have permission from Facebook, which means you have precisely zero extra security on Facebook.<p>But let's talk about security: do you really think your private stuff are really private on Facebook? If you want to control access to stuff, you are better off hosting a blog on a private server on an encrypted drive, that way your private info is really private.<p>> There's no monopoly since I can delete it and eventually FB will have to delete it too (now they hide it instantly).<p>You seem to confuse monopoly with consumer rights or control. If Facebook holds 90% of the social data in the world, it's a monopoly, period. Monopolies are illegal because they have the power to abuse. Also your deleted picture won't be hidden instantly, it will probably linger on a CDN for years to come. :)<p>> Not so on Google or when snippets are posted over and over again in blog after blog.<p>Are you implying that I can't copy paste your facebook post and repost it over and over again?",1334552060

Typically, these should be hard to copy things that you can evolve over time to make your business stronger. Here are some examples...<p>- Classic competitive advantages:<p>1. A strong sales force created by partnering which regional players that agreed to exclusively serve you (i.e. Groupon). In this case the barrier to entry is that, assuming you filtered your selections well, is very hard to get more or better seasoned/connected people to compete with an established player.<p>2. An algorithm that we developed and academia thinks is not going to work (Google). If academia thinks your algorithm is a good fit for the problem them that knowledge is public, well studied and been executed upon. (Google used secrecy, designed new systems and engaged in many partnerships with data centers initially to make their algorithm work at scale)<p>3. Network dynamics: Enlist developers and become a platform faster and better than the competition. This would create to barriers to entry: a spiraling viral growth curve that is hard to follow and the recognition and trust that developers will bring to your brand. Facebook won in part because of this and in part because MySpace, Ning and the other players couldn't execute as well as they did.<p>- Strong barriers to entry:<p>1. You already have 20M in VC, went global and have dominated most of the SERPS (search engine result pages) for your content network. This is a form of market share domination and you need to fight using guerrilla tactics in this case. For example, promote your site using social media, start in unexplored geographies or complete in the virgin mobile market. Some companies that fight using this technique are AOL, About.com, Demand Media and Mahalo.<p>2. A strong patent portfolio and the money and will to defend them. IP is not enough, you need good lawyers, the will to fight for your turf and a good set of Plan B's to execute when the competition infringes on you. Notice that you can't instantly avoid infringement, only deter it. Good examples of companies that use this include UStream, Apple and HP.<p>3. Brand and execution: People already know that DropBox is best to share files. But what if Apple created a new service to share files. They tried! But people are already familiar with the DropBox brand and prefer their execution: because now they can share files across platforms. Now, in order to win, the competition has to follow DropBox's model (which is the standard by which users measure quality) and then leapfrog them.<p>Business model design is a fascinating subject, if you which to answer most of your questions regarding this field and become  a Jedi in the architecture of competitive advantages and barriers to entry, I suggest you do the following:<p>- Read ""Business Model Generation: A Handbook for Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers""\n- Read Bill Gates Biography: Hard Drive (that has some fascinating stories about how Bill expanded Microsof to Asia and dominated the market!)<p>- Follow Clayton Christensen on twitter and read some of his papers.

So we had this module owner system, so I guess I'm the module owner of that. And at some point, we had checked in this de-coder for the MNG format which is a multiple network-or I don't know what it stands for.<p>But it's basically animated PNGs. So animated GIFs were all the rage with, you know, I don't know, 1998 websites or something. And they-but GIF is basically is indexed formats and it only supports 656 colors and it only works with one bit alpha transparency. So either the pixel is there, it's not. Versus PNG, which has full-it has eight bit alpha support. So you can have 256 levels of alpha so you can-things can be translucent. As well as true color support. So you can see as many colors as you want. So basically, you try to do that.<p><i>But then something went wrong and they decided that it also needed to do all these things that, like, Flash can do. So it needed to sort of be a movie format and then it-it kind of went-something went wrong at some point. GIFs are very simple, animated GIFs are easy and they-it was basically a very big and complex thing.</i> (emphasis added)<p>And then after having it in our product for, like, two or three years, we did some searchers and there were, like, fifty of these images on the web. So we decided-you know, we said, this is silly, this is like, four hundred kilobytes, you know, which was, like, three times bigger than all the other de-coders and the image library combined.<p>So we said, you know, this is-we don't need this anymore. So I removed it and we had a huge uproar. People were, like, ""We can't believe you removed this, you know."" It's, like-it was one of the, I think, probably one of the few cases where we've really gone in and said, ""We're going to remove a feature that we had before."" People apparently don't like that.<p>So I removed that. We had a lot of uproar and people said, ""You know, why did you do this?"" We said, ""You know, we have this set of reasons. It's too big, it's too slow, it's-nobody's really actively maintaining it."" What had happened is, the guy who was sort of working on it also said, ""We should remove this."" But then sort of the maintainer of sort of one of the MNG libraries and stuff that we were using said, ""No, No, this is-you know, we'll get this fixed.""<p>And it kind of got ugly for a while. But effectively what ended up happening was, we sort of have a system that's called a ""drivers"" which sort of-I guess they're in charge of the product releases and stuff or were. And sort of-it got raised up to there and in the end they sort of said, because I sort of said a thing. I said, ""You know if you guys can get it under this size and you can do all these things, we'll take it, whatever.""<p>But they never really did. And so they complained and complained and complained and they're still complaining to this day and this was, like, three years ago. So, you know, but in the end, driver said, ""You know, figure out how to meet these requirements. Get an active maintainer, do these things."" And nobody really has. They've made some effort but it's not really where we wanted to see it go.<p><i>I don't think they were really interested in meeting some of the requirements. I think they said, ""You know, this is-."" They were kind of just trying to chop random bits out and sort of mess with the functionality as opposed to sort of really reducing the size.</i> (emphasis added)<p>So we got rid of it. A lot of people were mad and, you know, it just sort of-in that case, it just sort of-we just decided that was the right thing to do. But I think in other situations, you know, I think a lot of times it's sort of just very small. Like, I mean, that's kind of a big argument. But you get into a lot of much smaller ones about just kind of minor things or design things, architectural things.<p>--------------------<p>Attempting to even read this was infuriating (thanks to the verbatim transcription of none-too-eloquent speech), but it galls how some of the devs seemed anti-progress at the time. Cut off a new format with low adoption but a promising featureset, because Flash, a non-open plugin, could be used to achieve similar functionality? Would they have opposed CSS3 transforms and animation at the time, too?<p>The paragraphs I italicized shows how this guy thought the featureset was basically pointless - as far as I can tell from his fragmented speech, anyway - and that the size was a big deal. What I get from this is that he thought it wasn't a useful format, and so size was used as a justification to remove it.<p>Many salient counter-arguments were raised in that thread but essentially rejected out of hand without any engagement. Mozilla might not be a democracy, but it would have behooved them to listen to users/contributors/stakeholders more in this case.",1334549457

3845855,comment,3836978,3844590,1,0,gruseom,,,"Interesting. It seems our views are similar on some aspects of this and divergent in others. I agree with you that the cell-based referencing system that treats every individual datum independently is too low-level and can lead to arbitrary spaghetti. (Boy do I know that spaghetti. I have been doing battle with that spaghetti. Or more precisely, with the computational model that you correctly describe as allowing for spaghetti.) There is clearly a need to express operations at a higher level: on vectors of data, let's say, rather than arbitrarily cell-by-cell. On the other hand, the grid layout and cell referencing system are the essence of the spreadsheet.  If you mess with it very much, you forfeit the familiarity of spreadsheet users and run the risk of forfeiting what makes spreadsheets so accessible and popular in the first place.  So I see the challenge less as ""how to come up with a more structured UI that maps to a more coherent dataflow model"" (where by ""coherent"" we mean literally, ""let related data cohere together"") and more as ""how to generalize existing spreadsheet language into something that allows for coherence and exploits it where possible"". Although spreadsheet language <i>allows</i> spaghetti, most spreadsheets do lay out their data and calcs in a coherent fashion. It's just that the system fails to recognize it.<p>Once one achieves ""coherent dataflow"", there might be a case for adding some features into spreadsheets at the application level that allow for declaring and visualizing more structure. But I think it's a mistake to start with that - or at least risky, because spreadsheet users like spreadsheets and there is no guarantee they will like anything else. (There's a reason why it's always programmers who come up with ideas for ""fixing"" the spreadsheet UI. You gave yourself away with the Haskell reference :)) The approach I'm advocating is risky too, though, since it's not obvious that there <i>is</i> any coherent generalization to be had out of the spreadsheet data model.<p><i>The reason why I can't be ""absolute"" about it is because in Calc (and Excel the last time I used it), to extend a computation over a vector, you highlight the computation and then [...] resize it into an area parallel to the input vectors</i><p>Yes, but in your example the computation that you extended this way had an identical number in every cell. (That is, by extending it, you were copying a formula guaranteed to evaluate to the same number in every cell of the column.) If that's correct, why copy that number at all? Why not just keep it in one cell and have everyone reference it from there? Is it that you wanted it to be visually nearby in every row? I'm probably just missing something about your example.<p><i>That sounds suspicious. mean(v) should be associated with the column v in a clear way.</i><p>But the solution is to make it very easy for you to lay out your data and calculations in the way you find clear.

Or that I could learn to bake well enough to keep up with the competition out the gate? No - chances are I'd either have to shell out good money to hire a skilled baker who actually knew what they were doing (and probably fail a lot regardless based on my total lack of knowledge in selling bread) and/or spend a few years producing deformed loaves of bread by myself before this plan would work.<p>So for the non-technical founder to start a technology company without the money to hire experienced technologists I think its completely unreasonable to expect anything less",1334549229

For decades the development has moved further north into the Ex-burbs and bedroom communities.<p>The interesting component is how the development gets financed in a Ponzi-esque scheme. Suburbs are built out with municipal bonds, which subsidize the build outs of services (schools, police, fire stations, roads) while keeping property taxes low. Once the suburb is completely built out, the taxes double or triple to pay back the bonds. Then the next suburb just north or south of it is built with more new bonds and the cycle continues.",1334549210
3845850,comment,3845594,3845764,10,0,ramchip,,,"There's a lot of problems: software engineers that come out of university are generally much less skilled than from comparable American or European universities, the culture and government policy discourages start-ups, most programmers speak very little English, workforce mobility is extremely low... many companies hire only fresh graduates through a tedious process that begins one year before graduation, and don't even hire experienced people.<p>Japanese companies usually suck at software. The emphasis has always been on the hardware -- one of the most obvious examples is the cellphones, which have always had extremely good hardware but very poor software and almost no applications to speak of. My 3-year-old phone has an 8MP camera, infrared transmission, TV, and I can use it as a train ticket, but the browser is so bad I can't even use Reddit's mobile version and it can't render HN comment pages with more than 100 or so comments.<p>Youtube and Facebook are not Japanese companies, after all.

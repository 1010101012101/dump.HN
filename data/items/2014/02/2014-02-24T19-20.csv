Few things we have built in the last two centuries will survive more than a decade if left unattended, and even fewer more than a century. It takes but a trip to Normandy to see german bunkers getting swallowed by nature. The smarter we get, the less durable we build things: we split atoms, we flick electrons and we land proxy explorers on nearby celestial bodies but our grandeur is a delusion and nothing will remain should our kin be obliterated. The testament of mankind that are such incredible buildings can only be surpassed by moving our butt out of this rock and sustain a decent living on the next one, ensuring our species survival. Any technological achievement is but a bullet point towards that goal.",1393271961

The `_tree` immutable tree library (<a href=""https://github.com/drfloob/_tree#quality-metrics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/drfloob/_tree#quality-metrics</a>) has a 1,024 child-node benchmark.

I found it fast enough for my client-side use cases, but Clojurescript&#x27;s optimized branching scheme could probably be implemented to boost performance.

Since Rosalyn is designed for being used in VS while you&#x27;re in the middle of typing, it has advanced functionality for handling incomplete or erroneous code.

If anything, there is probably more intense interest in the US operations from various nation states than anywhere else on earth. I was watching a documentary on UK/US spying (both human and communication intelligence, I believe it was called Modern Spies and from the BBC) and it was suggested from commentators from the CIA as well as Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service that the Chinese have stolen the largest mass of nuclear secrets and have even managed to copy some top secret technology in their fighter jets etc. The commentators also seemed to suggest that nobody is clear how it was done yet. Maybe that was scare tactics to make the Chinese seem scary, but on the assumption that it wasn&#x27;t, why wouldn&#x27;t that be considered an act of war? I think that is because the nations who are the most competent at spying are also the same nations you can&#x27;t beat in a 2 week war or nations that can impact heavily in an economic war and so the word isn&#x27;t chucked around as quickly.<p>I suppose one man&#x27;s act of war is another man&#x27;s act of diplomacy that can avoid war.",1393271317

7292949,comment,7291626,7291626,2,0,loz220,,,"Having recently worked on optimizing the performance of my own view extension library to Backbone (kettle.js), I can give some explanation about the relatively poor performance of Backbone&#x27;s todoMVC implementation in benchmark#1 and #2.<p>Benchmark 1) This benchmark deals with adding a bunch of todos and seeing how fast they render. \nThe major performance impact here seems to be jQuery. Specifically jQuery event delegation. I was surprised to find that binding DOM events in jQuery are incredibly slow, in fact the majority of the time in that benchmark is spent event binding. For comparison have a look at exoskeleton, a Backbone fork which removes the jQuery dependency and uses the native DOM methods instead. It&#x27;s also available on todomvc.com and uses pretty much the same code as the Backbone todo implementation.<p>Given the following benchmark :<p><pre><code>    var benchmark = function() {\n      app.todos.reset();\n      var s = [];var i=0; while (i<1000) {s.push({title:&#x27;foo&#x27;});i++};\n      var t  = performance.now();\n      app.todos.reset(s);\n      return performance.now() - t;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nBackbone: (<a href=""http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/backbone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/backbone/</a>)<p><pre><code>   >>benchmark()\n   >>667.2439999965718\n</code></pre>\nExoskeleton: <a href=""http://todomvc.com/labs/architecture-examples/exoskeleton/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://todomvc.com/labs/architecture-examples/exoskeleton/</a><p><pre><code>   >>benchmark()\n   >>226.4119999963441\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s worth mentioning that Backbone has a couple pull requests open that is meant to address this.<p>Benchmark 2) This benchmark deals with toggling all of the todos events at once. It builds up 200 todos and toggles them on and off 5 times.<p>The problem lies with using &#x27;all&#x27; and &#x27;change&#x27; events way too liberally within the todo application. Which causes a ton of needless render calls. During the course of this benchmark the main view has render called on it 6000 times (!) while the child views have render called on them for a total of 3000 times. I&#x27;m actually surprised that Backbone is as fast as it is given those type of numbers. What should happen is the main view should only need to render a total of 5 times (once for each toggle) and the child views 1000 times (200 items x 5 times).",1393270857

Murray’s marriage was breaking up, and he was behaving erratically—the whirling, unpredictable personality that Dan Aykroyd calls “the Murricane.” Ramis sent Rubin to New York to work with Murray on the script, because he was tired of taking his star’s 2 a.m. calls. Rubin says that when Ramis phoned him to check in, Murray would shake his head and mouth the words “I’m not here.” “They were like two brothers who weren’t getting along,” Rubin says. “And they were pretty far apart on what the movie was about—Bill wanted it to be more philosophical, and Harold kept reminding him it was a comedy.”</i><p><i>“At times, Bill was just really irrationally mean and unavailable; he was constantly late on set,” Ramis says. “What I’d want to say to him is just what we tell our children: ‘You don’t have to throw tantrums to get what you want. Just say what you want.’ ”</i><p><i>After the film wrapped, Murray stopped speaking to Ramis.

They can&#x27;t so much as change the way they <i>itemize</i> fees on my bill (!) without regulatory approval.<p>That certainly creates problems of another sort, but on the other hand, the actual service provided[0] and the pricing is pretty much a solved problem (as much as one can expect)[1].<p>I&#x27;m sure ConEd would <i>like</i> the sort of legislative protectionism that cable companies receive, with no requirements surrounding price or quality, but thankfully, they don&#x27;t have that (and altering the status quo is always tough in general - in this case, inertia is on consumers&#x27; side).<p>Obviously regulation could be established to make things worse, but I think it&#x27;s clear what kind of regulation we&#x27;re looking for for the purposes of this discussion. And I&#x27;m intentionally deferring the question of how any of these policies would be enacted - I&#x27;m just comparing two alternatives states to the status quo.<p>[0] excluding customer service, which is going to be mediocre at best no matter what.<p>[1] Interestingly, pricing is partly &quot;solved&quot; due to the introduction of ESCOs, which are a way to privatize the supply chain (at the consumer&#x27;s choice). &quot;Free market&quot; and &quot;regulation&quot; are not mutually exclusive - we could easily establish a regulated monopoly on last-mile copper wire while allowing multiple competing upstream providers.[2]",1393270600

Or something with a sufficient feature set to solve problems (which may become ktap, or perf_events, or lttng). However, most of the Linux performance issues I&#x27;m debugging are on Ubuntu systems. So the question remains: when will Linux-at-large get this capability?<p>Red Hat can certainly say that SystemTap is obviously a priority on their OS, and they can only make best effort for others. I said this in the talk. Indeed, a working SystemTap should be an incentive to run RHEL. It is a compelling argument -- the benefits of a working SystemTap are enormous (which I also explained in the talk). Sun made basically the same argument for switching to Solaris: a working DTrace.<p>Although, I&#x27;m not sure that using SystemTap is entirely safe for production yet, which I said was the most important priority.

I only care about this bug because I sometimes trace large subsets of the kernel (eg, all functions in a module or driver), and I think I&#x27;ve hit the same related issue. I don&#x27;t actually need to trace everything.<p>You said that DTrace can trace from userspace to kernel, which SystemTap can&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a specific case you&#x27;re referring to, but SystemTap nowadays can indeed trace userspace to kernel (via uprobes), and a lot of work has been happening to get SystemTap userspace tapsets to work.<p>As for setting up SystemTap being difficult on distros that don&#x27;t support or maintain SystemTap. Well, almost all of my customers run Ubuntu. If they hit perf issues, do I convince them to switch to RHEL? (The approach that Sun made for DTrace.) Or is this a problem to be taking up with the other Linux distro maintainers? Which goes back to my original point: when will Linux get this? :-)",1393269860

Read some Hobbes and look at the violence we see in (for instance) drug turf wars, when recourse to the state is denied.

So I&#x27;d be very surprised if that changed, and as long as that stays the same, interop at the transport layer isn&#x27;t hard to maintain.<p>However, there are lots of ways the transport / wire-protocol that we use to transmit the logical model could be improved.

However, my rationale for creating this tool was to provide a seamless addition to the Linux command line toolset - A tool as most Linux commands are, and not a capability. The distinction I&#x27;m doing here is that tools are reusable, composable and such, vs a capability which is usually less reusable in different contexts. I&#x27;m sure that some of the above are definitely tools. I just hope that the tool I have created provides value to people and helps them with their tasks.<p>As I posted here elsewhere, my complete rationale for creating the tool is available on the README of the github project.

Indeed, you&#x27;re taking the very concept of human rights itself as an axiom, and that&#x27;s why everything follows so cleanly for you.<p>But step out of the box. There is no reason for everyone to believe that. Most people through history did not believe in it. Many of them would have equally rational arguments to the contrary. Your very concept of &quot;rights&quot; as something fundamental is a deeply held Western social norm and &quot;collective agreement.&quot; Because 9/10 people collectively agree that we have rights, our rights are protected and enforced.<p>If they did not agree, your idea of rights would be regarded as a fine bit of eccentricity and people would kill you as a sacrifice to the god Asdkjhf and feel that it was not only right and just but necessary. In other words, your rights would be completely meaningless. They are not an objective construct you can hold up as a shield against all wrongs.<p>Morality is an entirely different argument. But within the commonly held philosophical framework, a (democratic) government cannot be compared to a mafia because the government represents the will of the people while the mafia does not. But this argument can never convince you, because you have taken the axiom of individual rights to the extreme while not taking other axioms.",1393268526

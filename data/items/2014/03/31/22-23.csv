7504902,comment,7504296,7504560,11,0,fennecfoxen,,,"What you get down is really a question about what marriage is about. Is marriage about giving government benefits (property transfer benefits, tax treatment changes, certain treatment under health insurance regulations, <i></i>adoption<i></i> miscellaneous other things) to two people who like each other a lot? Or is it about giving government benefits to people who might found a family with children and things (notwithstanding the fact that not every heterosexual couple actually does or plans to do this?)<p><i></i>That&#x27;s the real question here.<i></i> This issue isn&#x27;t about hate and dehumanization -- I mean, there&#x27;s way too much hate and dehumanization, certainly, but not enough to drive electoral victories we&#x27;ve seen. The question is just an extension of the social upheaval of the sexual revolution of the 1960s. The real remarkable thing is that it&#x27;s been simmering for so long without coming to the forefront yet. Probably many people thought that it was substantially settled, on account of this quiet, but it looks more like the two camps just quietly went their separate ways.<p>This is also why religious groups <i>outside of Westboro</i> mostly talk about focusing on the family and the social problems associated with single-parent households and divorce. (If you are not a member of these groups or do not have friends and family who are members of these groups, you are probably unaware of what this advocacy looks like. See also: the entire public policy of the Catholic church on this matter.)<p>FYI: This is how you can have an eminently nice person with nothing but respect for the intrinsic human rights and dignity of homosexuals, but who still votes for Prop 8 or Amendment 1 or a similar measure.<p>And you know what? What goes on between two people in private of their bedroom is nobody&#x27;s business. What benefits the government makes available to people, through spending the public purse or giving people tax breaks or mandating certain sorts of treatment... that kind of is peoples&#x27; business. It&#x27;s a public-policy question, and structuring public policy one way or another impacts society in several ways - including, in some jurisdictions, making your ability to operate as a business contingent on you performing some services that you might not want to perform (cf. New Mexico photography etc etc).<p>(Postscript. No particular stance for or against Proposition 8, or for or against Amendment 1, or any other public policy recommendation, is hereby endorsed. The following ideas are hereby endorsed: Gay people are human beings and deserve a substantially identical set of human rights and dignity as any other human being is entitled to receive. People who treat them otherwise may be some sort or another of monster.  The extent to which these rights overlap with public policy in the matter of issuing marriages is controversial. Voters who support Amendment 1 or Prop 8, electorally or fiscally, are not monsters for doing so. Pluralism is good and it would be great if we all had some way to get along. Maybe we can start with more understanding.)<p>(Post-postscript. Added adoption to the list of misc. benefits as it is of special relevance as a way for a married gay couple to raise children.)",1396306798

7504872,comment,7503829,7504725,12,0,steveklabnik,,,"There are a couple of reasons, actually. This will be a short version of something I&#x27;m still in the process of writing, so consider this very high level, broad strokes. Consider &quot;Coinbase&quot; a stand-in for any service like it. I also know that lots of Bitcoin enthusiasts won&#x27;t agree with me, and that&#x27;s fine.<p>The most important one is that merchants generally want USD, not BTC. Instant Exchange is a really important feature of Coinbase, and so even if we did support bare addresses, they would still be generated through Coinbase anyway, because giving our merchants USD is killer. Since Balanced isn&#x27;t interested in getting in the business of holding and selling BTC, we&#x27;d need to do that through some sort of service, and Coinbase is the biggest and best one.<p>Secondly, the UX for Coinbase-only payment is vastly superior to using bare addresses. People are generally familiar with &quot;sign in via Facebook,&quot; and Coinbase&#x27;s OAuth works the same way. Using a Bitcoin wallet to buy something on a site is very strange until you&#x27;ve done it a few times. Enthusiasts will know what&#x27;s going on, just like any early adopter will. But for most cases, Coinbase only is waaaay better.<p>Coinbase <-> Coinbase transactions have another special property: they can be off-blockchain. I don&#x27;t remember offhand if they are for all purchases, but they are for microtransactions, at least. Coinbase can (could?) not wait for the ten minutes to confirm a transaction, since they&#x27;d just be updating balances within Coinbase itself. They could build options in that consumers have come to expect, like chargebacks, holds, and other things, that the protocol would not inherently have to support.<p>Next, we feel that Bitcoin is best thought of as cash. Like, physical, printed notes. Websites don&#x27;t actually accept USD, for example: they accept Visa, which is a financial instrument that happens to be denominated in USD. You can&#x27;t mail a twenty dollar bill to most SaaS products: that&#x27;d be really silly, for a number of reasons. Using bitcoin-qt is like paying with cash, and paying with cash works great in some ways, but is a pain in others. Chargebacks, for example, are an incredibly important part of the advantage consumers see in using credit cards, and nothing like that exists with &#x27;raw&#x27; Bitcoin in any significant capacity.<p>I guess that could all be summed up with &quot;Most people don&#x27;t actually use cash, because it&#x27;s pretty inconvenient. They use a financial instrument on top of cash, because it offers a bunch of advantages for online purchases. A successful Bitcoin will be no different.&quot;",1396306518

Calling me after work, whatever you want, costs several hundred pounds a go.<p>My sister, who works a bunch of part time jobs in retail and other minimum wage things get called on after hours as well. And she doesn&#x27;t get paid for it beyond not being fired. She&#x27;d never dare tell one of her managers not to call her after work, because if she loses one of her jobs she&#x27;s going to have trouble paying her bills.<p>In my case the conditions in my contract ensure that I only get called if it&#x27;s important.

Whereas, between companies and individuals, the individual is generally expected to be mostly protected by the allowances of consumer protection law.<p>> would people be okay with Olympic Trainers being banned from asking their athletes to train after hours?<p>Well, I would.

7504814,comment,7503881,7504382,3,0,kylerush,,,"Low traffic levels do not mean that you cannot do any meaningful testing. It means that you cannot reliably detect subtle effects in the conversion rate. Whereas Google may be able to reliably detect a 0.005% effect in the conversion rate, a small startup may only be able to reliably detect a 60% effect in the conversion rate. A small startup should arguably not be chasing after small effects in the conversion rate anyway.<p>Evan Miller has a great sample size calculator to illustrate this: <a href=""http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html</a><p>In the example above, Google&#x27;s MDE is 0.005% and the small startup&#x27;s MDE is 60%. If the small startup&#x27;s baseline conversion rate is 5%, then with 95% confidence and 80% statistical power, they can reliably detect a 60% effect (positive or negative) with 1,968 visits.<p>It&#x27;s not just the 60% increase that you should be mindful of. I bet you all small startups want to know if the change they made to their homepage decreases the conversion rate by 60% or more. With an a/b test, they can do that.<p>Another point to keep in mind is that you can learn a lot from a statistical tie (not enough data to conclude there is a difference). In fact, no matter what your traffic levels are, most of your experiments will be a statistical tie. It&#x27;s important to learn what doesn&#x27;t work just as it&#x27;s important to know what does work. This can really help you with prioritization. In the example above, the small startup can use the statistical tie to draw the conclusion that some tasks in their product roadmap will result in less than a 60% effect in the conversion rate and can be prioritized as such.<p>But ultimately it will be quite difficult for the small startup to produce variations that have at least a 60% effect in the conversion rate, but it&#x27;s not unheard of and again, you can learn from a statistical tie.<p>Just because you have low levels of traffic doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t learn anything from a/b testing.",1396306061

Attempting to emulate the x86 on an Arm would be terribly slow.<p>It&#x27;s not you&#x27;re emulating an entire operating system: the operating system (and many libraries) are native, but the application code is emulated.  It&#x27;s faster than you think, and Apple has already done it twice: once in 1994, and once in 2005 (exercise for the reader: try extrapolating).<p>Apple&#x27;s applications would be 100% native long before the ARM version shipped.  Some intensive tasks—text rendering, audio/video/image encoding and decoding, HTML layout, JavaScript—these would also be native on third-party apps, since you just have to write the right glue into the emulator.  This would be a lot easier than the 2005 switch from PowerPC to x86, which involved emulating a system with 4x as many GPRs and the opposite endian: ARM has 2x the GPRs as x86-64.<p>Sure, a bunch of apps will see reduced performance.  Some will break.  But remember: Apple has only been on x86 for ten years.  We had the same problems during the PowerPC->x86 transition: you had to wait about two years to get a version of Photoshop that ran on x86 + OS X.<p>I&#x27;m willing to bet that Apple has been testing OS X on ARM for years now.",1396305636

On directly competing routes major carriers often end up with the same fares and matching each others&#x27; moves, but the exact process of who leads and who follows is complex. There is all kinds of informal signalling where companies attempt to figure out the others&#x27; intentions without directly colluding. For example, a company might trial a $50 fare increase in response to increasing costs, and hope others will match it. If others don&#x27;t, they might be forced to roll back the increase to avoid losing market share, admitting the trial was unsuccessful. It&#x27;s in effect an offer of, &quot;hey everyone, I think we should raise prices $50 on this route, do you match?&quot;, followed by &quot;ok, I guess not, retracting&quot; if they don&#x27;t, but not explicit.",1396305608

You can have one row for phones and 6 for status monitors in the lobby. etc.<p>The grid actually works on a principle called &quot;pull to left.&quot; It was a UX decision in the end. &quot;Left&quot; is because the grid is designed horizontally (but should be made an option to use the other axis very easily), and &quot;pull&quot; is because we found (after much usability testing) that if you don&#x27;t have any <i>force</i> in a drag and drop system, items will involuntarily continue to move away from each other as you move them around and collisions occur.<p>I get where you come from with the jQuery plugin. However, due to many reasons (including time and reducing in-house complexity) jQuery was advantageous for its build-in drag and drop capabilities.

Neither of us probably has a ready answer, but if you&#x27;d like to put some money on which way this will go, I&#x27;m game.<p>For awhile during the late 1990s, some products used BSAFE because there were patent concerns with using any public key encryption in a commercial product, and BSAFE was an innoculation. Also, some products have codebases that date back before credible open-source crypto libraries. But those same products tend to have crypto <i>features</i> that were implemented later.<p>Like I said, we do a lot of casual reversing, and we look at a <i>lot</i> of random products that big F500 companies deploy, because F500s pay us to do that. I see a <i>lot</i> of OpenSSL. After that, I see a lot of Windows Cryptography API. Next in line is probably cryptopp, and then Bouncycastle.

Pardon this interruption of your OkCupid experience.<p>Mozilla’s new CEO, Brendan Eich, is an opponent of equal rights for gay couples. We would therefore prefer that our users not use Mozilla software to access OkCupid.<p>Politics is normally not the business of a website, and we all know there’s a lot more wrong with the world than misguided CEOs. So you might wonder why we’re asserting ourselves today. This is why: we’ve devoted the last ten years to bringing people—all people—together. If individuals like Mr. Eich had their way, then roughly 8% of the relationships we’ve worked so hard to bring about would be illegal. Equality for gay relationships is personally important to many of us here at OkCupid. But it’s professionally important to the entire company. OkCupid is for creating love. Those who seek to deny love and instead enforce misery, shame, and frustration are our enemies, and we wish them nothing but failure.<p>If you want to keep using Firefox, the link at the bottom will take you through to the site.<p>However, we urge you to consider different software for accessing OkCupid:<p>Google Chrome / Internet Exploder / Opera / Safari<p>Thank you, \nOkCupid<p>Background on Mr. Eich and Mozilla<p>In 2008, Mr. Eich supported the passage of California’s Prop 8, a statewide initiative to ban gay marriage, with a $1000 donation. Granted, his contribution is now six years in the past, and people can change. But Mr. Eich’s boilerplate statements in the time since make it seem like he has the same views now as he did then. Mozilla recently promoted him to CEO, hence the issue only now coming to our attention. His donation was known to Mozilla at the time of his promotion, and, furthermore, CEOs are rewarded based on their company’s performance. The CEO is the visionary for a company and its products. We are sad to think that any OkCupid page loads would even indirectly contribute towards the success of an individual who supported Prop 8—and who for all we know would support it again. We wish Mozilla’s institutional commitment to freedom and openness were better reflected by their choice of leadership.<p>Continue to OkCupid",1396304845

To me, a future in which people are still engaged in manual labor is one where technology has stopped improving or even failed.<p>For example, I’m shocked that people still pick crops by hand.  Some of that is propped up by immigration laws and being able to pay farm workers below minimum wage.  Otherwise someone surely would have automated it by now.

Contrived challenges like copying Barack Obama&#x27;s signature 10,000 times or setting up a convention booth really had nothing to do with drawing a comic. Even the comic-drawing elimination challenges seemed like a poor fit for some of the cartoonists due to the extreme time constraints.",1396303363

I feel (perhaps wrongly) that I already &quot;invest&quot; a lot in myself, but I also feel I could be doing more, or finding a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; solution to an early retirement. I just get frustrated to no end when someone says &quot;invest in the stock market! It&#x27;s easy!&quot;, then they explain that all you have to do is keep tabs of a zillion different little market factors everyday, and oh by the way, pay for their super secret money making formula. The painstaking research on companies and the environments in which they operate might be fun for some (dare I say, most fantasy sports people or sports fans in general would be better served by putting their stats minded heads towards financial matters?), but it sounds too much like a second job to me.<p>The point about bicycle commuting is extremely cogent, however, as I <i>do</i> have a working bicycle and a commute that lends itself well to it. But I am lazy, at what I estimate of cost of between 800-1200USD a year, and it&#x27;s only going to go up. Still, I might be able to motivate myself with some righteousness about being better than all the gas guzzlers . . .<p>All that aside, I can say one of my favorite &quot;get rich slowly&quot; books (that came out before that phrase was invented) is &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot;, although it&#x27;s fairly dated (T-Notes at 15%? I wish!)",1396303345

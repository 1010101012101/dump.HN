I deeply care about this community, as its one of my primary outlets for intellectual expression and stimulation.<p>If you look at any of my past posts that involve discussion of famo.us you will see that I&#x27;ve attempted to remain as neutral as possible and always a disclaimer of my affiliation whenever I&#x27;ve stated an opinion that merits one.<p>Like you I&#x27;ve also been one to point out conflicts or interest or even go as far as to investigate suspicious comments on hacker news to see if there may be a conflict of interest someone should disclose. I too am a vociferous defender of the culture on HN.<p>If anyone can understand your concerns and suspicions, it&#x27;s me. However I will vouch on the honor of all the karma I&#x27;ve earned as a member of this community that there was no payola involved involved in the writing of this post. Even if someone at the company were plotting to do a payola for a blog post, I would question it. At previous jobs I have prevented any several attempts to make edits to Wikipedia articles about the organization for which I worked because of the clear conflict of interest.<p>Lastly, if my word is not sufficient, and you are the type to require some sort of proof. I will present the following evidence that demonstrates that Byron Matto (bmatto) on HN is the kind of developer to be self motivated to promote an open-source project he believes in. On April 19, I saw that Byron was giving a lightning talk in Boston at a Javascript meetup (I check reddit, HN, meetup.com and google crawl results from the last 24hrs about once a day). I reached out to him via twitter, to see if we could be of any help [0]. To my knowledge this is the only interaction between bmatto and the company, except for may IRC conversations. I believe he might be one of the people that idle on #famous on freenode. Obviously, you may interpret this piece of evidence as proof of relation, but I hope that between my word and the acknowledgment that bmatto has, of his own volition, given back to the JS community at least once prior to any contact with the company as sufficient to suggest that your top-most voted comment may be the kind of dismissive post the likes of which PG is concerned about on HN.<p>Think what you will about famous after this, I just hope you can find it in you to give bmattos here a little respect as the kind of developer that maintains a blog and shares his experiences. I know I&#x27;m indebted to him and hundreds of other developers like him that take the initiative to contribute.<p>[0] <a href=""https://twitter.com/andrewdeandrade/status/457637905435869184"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/andrewdeandrade/status/45763790543586918...</a>",1399441180

Something inane in one culture could be awkward and insulting in another, no matter what it is.<p>For example if a date or someone I was out with said to me, “Whatever oil well you own, I hope it keeps pumping!”, my cultural background would lead me to believe this was implying I was spending outside my means, as I&#x27;m clearly not an oil-tycoon and shouldn&#x27;t be spending like one. I would then be forced into the situation of trying to downplay my financial situation, the opposite of what the comment intended.<p>In the case of someone asking me what I do when I&#x27;m unemployed, I&#x27;d give the answer I&#x27;ve heard many people from my similar background give, &quot;I&#x27;m between jobs.&quot;, which often results in polite condolences and moving on. “So how do you spend your time?” would be somewhat off-putting as well, as it could imply that you assume I don&#x27;t work, which would be insulting in my culture.<p>Cross-cultural communication doesn&#x27;t have some one-size-fits-all correct answer.

It&#x27;s not that they are averse to their parts being used in life-critical applications; it&#x27;s that they have specific lines for that purpose, consisting of parts which have undergone much heavier and more stringent testing as compared to the general-purpose lines, and if a designer of life-critical hardware can&#x27;t be bothered to get in touch with TI and arrange to source parts from one of those lines, then TI&#x27;s not going to be held responsible for a bad result -- nor should they.<p>I dare say Apple&#x27;s reasoning is similar. It&#x27;s not that they actually expect (e.g.) iTunes to comprise a critical component of a nuclear weapon&#x27;s operating software, inasmuch as such a device has any; rather, it&#x27;s that if someone does for some lunatic reason actually build an iTunes module which happens to set off a 1Kt IND when you play the same Lady Gaga track ten times in a row, Apple&#x27;s not going to be held responsible. Granted, it&#x27;s a particularly stupid and pointless example of gratuitous lawyerese, but the underlying reasoning is probably very similar to TI&#x27;s.

That&#x27;s an absolute joke.<p>I have absolutely nothing against him putting ads and IAP in the game to try to make money, as money is in fact the main reason for doing work. What I don&#x27;t understand is this BS post. Sure he cloned a game style, but who really cares about that. It&#x27;s not even a little unreasonable to clone a game mechanic. Does anybody think candy crush is a worse game because it is a cloned mechanic? no, it is a highly polished and well done version, and it&#x27;s fine. Same goes for 2048 IMO.<p>The real question is what is the point of this post? Oh noes I didn&#x27;t want to profit off it and I felt bad, but I was missing a once in a lifetime opportunity to waste a month of my life, oh what the hell let&#x27;s put ads in it anyway.",1399439026

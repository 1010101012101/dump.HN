I thought it wouldn't work in the desert though, or surely it would already have been tried.<p>Basically, we were reading about just how difficult it is to get water out of saltwater in coastal communities, and the massive power costs involved, and I just thought, ""well, we sometimes have to use a dehumidifier at home, and I know that that runs on the mains power and could generate easily enough water for two or three of us to survive. Coastal environments have very wet air, so just let the Sun act on the ocean to do the hard part of desalination, and we reap the benefits of clean water?""<p>I gave up because I'd calculated that this would also probably cost more money than poor coastal areas had, but yeah, wind turbines have grown amazingly in the past several years and the principle is pretty sound. (It is not clear what the longer-term environmental impact would be, but it's possible that if we deploy too many of these things, inland droughts could become more severe due to lack of cloud formation.)<p>I'm glad to see that someone has paired renewable energy and automatic solar evaporation with the problem of desalination. Well worth some charity money, though the company as it stands appears to be for-profit. Would be nice to see if a charity could set some of these up in Wajir, Kenya, as a politically safer experiment towards deploying them into the drought-ridden Jubaland in Somalia.",1334743090

3857166,comment,3855625,3855625,3,0,malone,,,"Streams are nice but in my experience there aren't many modules that let you use them. Most networking protocol modules will only let you specify a hostname and port to connect to, and not pass a stream to use. That's fine for the common case, but maybe I want to do something fun like send data encrypted with ssl, which is encoded using base 64, then stuffed in a dns query, then tunnelled over socks, via a unix pipe (and receive the reply via a completely different stack). It wouldn't be hard to chain streams together to achieve that, but then I'd have to rewrite modules to actually use it.<p>Even nodes own http module only does standard tcp. If it supported arbitrary streams then it'd be much more flexible, and we wouldn't need to do things like use a separate module to support https.<p>The same with the server part of these modules. They normally only let you specify a tcp port to listen to. Ideally there should be some sort of ""stream server"" interface that automatically sets up the stream chain and emits a connection event. The module could then listen for that event and use the corresponding stream for transferring the data. That way the module would be completely independent of the underlying protocol.",1334742097

The steam goes through a cooling compressor that creates moisture which is then condensed and collected.""<p>Um what?? Why are they heating air? And you don't make steam if you heat air.<p>That's either a huge typo, or whoever wrote that has no idea what they are talking about. Maybe they tried to summarize the source without understanding it?<p>You could either cool the air to condense the water, or compress the air, which heats it temporarily, then you cool it back down and collect the water. It's ideal to recover the energy either way though and this process doesn't seem to do that.<p>And in any case what does this have to do with a wind turbine? This is basically a de-humidifyer. You can power those with anything - wind, electricity, gasoline.<p>I suggest they use the wind turbine to make electricity, and then power the de-humidifyer from that. That way you can pick and choose what you want to power, and you can power the de-humidifyer from something else when necessary.<p>BTW the link they have on the words ""simple process"" in fact has nothing whatsoever to do with this process. Who writes this stuff? Someone who never learned any science?",1334741251

Their pay is great, hiring demand for their skills is through the roof, and working conditions have never been better. And thats why the job of Software Engineer ranks tops in our annual Jobs Rated report on the nations best and worst jobs for 2012.<p>Of course, any job may seem like the best job if youre unemployed and the improving economy hasnt ushered you back into the workforce. But there are qualities that make some professions more desirable than the rest of the pack. Again this year our researchers looked high and low to find those occupations that ranked the best in five key areas: Work Environment, Physical Demands, Job Outlook, Income Levels and Stress. And it should be no surprise that Software Engineer ranks No. 1, followed by Actuary, Human Resources Manager, Dental Hygienist and Financial Planner.<p>I absolutely agree that Software Engineers have the best job. I love my job and most of the people who are drawn to this field are passionate about it, says Phil Danne, Lead Software Engineer for Livio Radio in Michigan. Although there are ample job opportunities for qualified Software Engineers, Danne warns recent graduates, You can't earn your college degree and bank on just those skills for the rest of your career. You have to constantly be seeking out latest knowledge and skills to succeed.<p>Jobs Rated Links<p> The 10 Worst Jobs of 2012<p> All 200 Rated Jobs<p> Our Methodology<p> Sign-Up For Jobs Rated Alerts\nThis year, there are several professions that are making their inaugural appearance on our Jobs Rated Top 10 Best Jobs list.  Human Resources Manager ,  Financial Planner , Occupational Therapist and Online Advertising Manager are all rated as a Top 10 Best Job for the first time due to a combination of high incomes, great environments, good job growth and relatively low unemployment rates.<p>Employment growth for  Human Resources Managers, for example, is projected to be a very healthy 21% thru 2020, which is on par with most medical professions, according to The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you mix their job outlook scores with their income levels (19th on our Jobs Rated list) and throw in the low physical demands, relatively safe work environment and low-to-moderate stress levels, HR Managers should rightly be listed as a Best Job.<p>""Every organization has a need for a Human Resources professional. Companies big and small need someone who is skilled in HR,"" says Pat Kuhl, Vice President of Human Resources for a Maryland health care system. Today, professionals in Human Resources have more of a strategic role than ever before. We are relied upon to make sure the needs of the employee are in sync with the companys goals and in support of the organizations mission,"" says Kuhl, who adds, Its not always an easy job, but it is very rewarding.<p>With the increase in digital computing demands and healthcare needs, it makes sense that most of the professions on our Best Jobs list this year are related to the fields of math, science and healthcare.",1334740677

9586872,comment,9586515,9586829,0,0,maudineormsby,,,"Quick explanation:<p>Fines are the very small coffee particles created by the grinding or crushing of the bean. They are generally undesirable as for even extraction of the coffee you want uniformly sized coffee particles. Fines also tend to end up in your cup and can make the brew gritty.<p>Extractions can mean a few things but in a nutshell, it&#x27;s the amount of flavor compounds in the bean that end up in your brew. If you say &#x27;20%&#x27; extracted you mean that 20% of the weight of the coffee ended up taken out by the brewing process (I believe you brew then dry the grounds and weigh before/after).<p>Slight differences could be the difference between bold flavor and over-brewed bitterness. Also different coffees will want different extraction amounts depending on their flavor profile and such; as a general rule most people use too little coffee and overextract it, thus getting all the bitter compounds from the coffee and thinking it tastes bad.",1432277821

9586836,comment,9577988,9583722,0,0,zvrba,,,"Unsigned numbers in C++ are completely unsuitable for restricting the domain range because their &quot;rank&quot; (technical term) is higher than that of equally-sized signed types, which means that all operands are promoted to unsigned if one operand is unsigned. Of course, the result is unsigned too.<p>Now, you often want to do arithmetic with numbers, right? You could think that, given two containers with c1.size() < c2.size(), that c1.size()-1 < c2.size()-1, right? Wrong.<p>Because of default promotion rules and size() returning an unsigned number, (signed) 1 is converted to an unsigned number and the whole expression is evaluated in modulo arithmetic.<p>Now, if c1 is empty (c1.size() == 0), then subtracting 1 from 0 in unsigned arithmetic wraps around (this is how unsigned arithmetic is <i>defined</i>) to a huge number (4 billion on 32 bit machines). The simple comparison above will fail in <i>THE</i> singular case of having an empty container on left hand side.<p>You also lose any possibility of detecting errors. (E.g., if size() were signed and could return a negative number, you could effectively assert on that. If assert triggered, then something really bad happened -- maybe two concurrent threads modifying the data structure w/o proper synchronization.)<p>I personally think it makes reasoning about a program harder; the above comparison was just the most trivial example. unsigned<>signed comparisons also trigger a bunch of warnings, because I use signed numbers for everything else, so the code ends up having a bunch of unnecessary casts. (I do not want to disable the warning because genuine mishaps of mixing signed/unsigned do happen.)<p>I believe the consensus is (also Stroustrup&#x27;s recommendation) is that unsigned should be used as  &quot;give me modulo arithmetic&quot; instead of &quot;this number cannot be negative&quot;.<p>So, IMHO, unsigned size() was a mistake and is a big PITA when you try to develop robust software and creates less maintainable code (e.g. in the above simple example, you&#x27;d have to special-case the c1.empty() case with if). Casting size() to signed type immediately if I&#x27;m going to do anything else than iterate over the container is the least evil for me.",1432276861

The coffee from both machines tastes good, and the process is ridiculously simple.  We used to have a Gaggia machine too, but we ended up relocating it to the garage, in a cardboard box, because making coffee using it was really just too much effort - buying the appropriate coffee, storing it, tamping it, and so on, just didn&#x27;t really seem like all that much fun to us, and often the results were quite unpredictable (sometimes stronger, sometimes weaker).  The Nespresso and Lavazza machines seem to produce identical cups of coffee every time, which I generally view as a positive.  (All three machines were roughly the same price, ~£100.)<p>Sometimes I drink expensive coffee in fancy coffee places in London, where it&#x27;s £3+ for a cup.  The coffee definitely has different flavours from the cups I have at home, but I can&#x27;t honestly say I very often think it&#x27;s much, much better.",1432276041

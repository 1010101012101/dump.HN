Doing things the needlessly complex way doesn't make you a better or manlier programmer.<p>By the way, a lot of these perl and python scripts spend most of their time calling into C libraries anyway, so the performance difference is often negligible.",1221022792

One of the points was that 10,000 users was a failure for a VC funded startup. That's not necessarily the case if you don't have an inherent valuation you need to aim for.",1221021212

I didn't know who he was at the time of tuning in live, but there's about 10 different ways to say that without making the poor startup guy feel like a humiliated loser. He has a dream-- maybe Mark will bring him back down to reality, but I personally think the same sort of response could have been said about Wikipedia, Knol, About.com, Mahalo, etc.<p>Just because Mark and Kevin Rose didn't quite follow the long-term vision, it doesn't mean it can't catch on or grow. Hopefully the imindi guys will figure out a better way to present/grow their technology such that people won't have that kind of reaction, but that kind of comment didn't give me any new respect for Mr. Cuban. (I did enjoy the transcript of his one-on-one interview, though.)<p>I guess I have a lot of dreams like the imindi guys and can empathize with them. I also think there's a lot of long-term value in gathering cross-related/semantic data.",1221020756

300096,comment,299451,299641,0,0,palish,,,"""Some languages ... can perform very favorably compared to C, but tend to be much, much easier to maintain and debug.""<p>Keep in mind that each language has a learning curve.  As you learn more languages, that curve becomes much easier to traverse.  However, the goal is to Get Stuff Done.  The most straightforward engineering tactic to accomplish that is to become highly skilled with a few choice tools, then use those tools to solve almost all of your problems.  (Note: that's different than a ""one tool for every problem"" mindset.  You can solve most problems with a small toolbox while still avoiding the trap of using an inappropriate tool for the job.)",1221020661

There are many developers who simply can't do that; they have tunnelvision, wasting a ton of time on improving portions of their systems without first thinking deeply about the problem they're trying to solve (and about simple ways to sidestep that problem).<p>In your case, you identified the correct problem, which was ""How can I maximize the number of sites crawled per day?"" and not ""How can I optimize [the database, the perl scripts, etc]?""  And then you did the most straightforward optimization you thought of, accomplishing your goal in one or two nights.  Your solution is valid, maintainable, and most importantly works, and so I personally don't see anything wrong with it.  Again, nice hack.",1221019465

300077,comment,299938,299938,0,0,aston,,,"The first thing that came to mind when I saw this preso was ""What algorithm are they using to find the words?"" The problem looks something like: Given a string of characters, find all possible words that start and end like the string of characters and use any number of characters in between.<p>The best I can come up (after not so much thinking about it) with is using Bloom Filters. Precompute the bit vector for every word in your dictionary, then after they swype, compute a vector for the string of characters and run it up against all the words in your dictionary that start and end with the same letters. Still kind of an expensive linear search, albeit fast (since it's just boolean AND).",1221019268

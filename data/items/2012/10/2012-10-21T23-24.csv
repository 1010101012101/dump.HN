Definitely two jobs.<p>This is what made a difference for me between chaos and depressive thoughts to happiness and success: Alway Be Present.<p>When you spend time with the kids, be present and have a good time. That means no checking email, no thinking about the future, no thinking about the past. Be with them, as they know and feel when you're physically present but not mentally. This is good for everyone; spending no-guilt time with your kids will reenergize you and make you a better (smarter even!) person.<p>When you are working, be present too. If you are pretending to work but thinking you should be with your kids, drop everything and go play with them. What will make your life miserable is trying to work while feeling guilty for being a bad parent. You won't get anything useful done, and you won't be a good parent either.<p>Also, when you hang out with the kids, make it also a fun time for yourself. Get out of the house, do fun stuff, be a kid with them. You'll be killing two birds with one stone.<p>VCs reading here might not like this: companies are disposable and kids will be with you for all your life. Chose wisely where you want to make the bulk of your mistakes.",1350863992

4681240,comment,4680965,4681202,7,0,BruceIV,,,"I installed Windows 8 this weekend on my primary machine (my school has an MSDN subscription). My initial impression is that it's actually an upgrade on the desktop - the Start screen really is better as an app launcher, and the app search works quite quickly (it was always dog-slow on Windows 7 on the same computer); the small upgrades to the task manager, taskbar, and Windows Explorer are nice too. It took a bit of time to figure out the new UI (it's all hot corners, but they're well hinted if you know to look for them), but it's pretty reasonable. That's the good news - the bad news is that all Metro apps (especially the Microsoft-branded ones) are useless, ad-ridden, under-featured dreck - if you clear them all from your start screen, it's a decent OS, but even Solitaire has ads, and takes a good 10 seconds to load because of its pointless XBox live integration.",1350863531

4681235,comment,4679933,4681156,5,0,stedolan,,,"Thanks!<p>1. I think your example shows sed/awk's failings with JSON data :) I don't want to write a JSON parser by hand every time I want to pull a field out of an object, and parsing recursive structures with regexes is never a good plan.<p>2. It reads JSON items from stdin into memory, one at a time. So if the input is a single giant JSON value, it all goes into memory, but if it's a series of whitespace-separated values they'll be processed sequentially.<p>It's cat-friendly: if you do<p><pre><code>    cat a | jq foo; cat b | jq foo
</code></pre>
then it's the same as doing<p><pre><code>    cat a b | jq foo</code></pre>",1350863458

This reduces degrees of freedom, and frees up your mind.  The reason you do this is <i>precisely</i> that it lets you focus on higher level abstractions. It might just be me (probably is) but I found that math got <i>more intuitive</i> this way. Also, if your aim is to make the basic building blocks both reliable and intuitive, it will get used more in daily life. If you need to reference a text, it will ~never happen.

That probaly wasn't clear in the initial comment I made (as several people have pointed out logic~abstraction, etc). So I'm not saying this should be the limit or ceiling of an education. Its just the opposite. But its shocking the kinds of things that happen otherwise. And its not fair to the kids who never get a shot at doing serious work, because their fundamentals are unsound.

We didn't have much in the way of furniture before, but we did give everything away that didn't fit into the bed of our truck.<p>When we arrived we made it a point not to buy a single piece of furniture.  We relied entirely on unwanted furniture of friends and the Craigslist free section.  With the help of our pickup truck we had a fully furnished home within a month for nothing more than the cost of gas.  Next time we move a long distance we'll just give it all away and collect all new furniture at our next home.  Its really liberating not being attached to anything in our home.<p>We don't pay for anything more than cable internet, pre-pay data and basic utilities.  We don't even have a TV.  We get all our movies and entertainment at the library for free.  They allow for up to 6 DVDs for each of us, so we really don't miss TV or cable.<p>We also use Google Voice for all our phone calls and texting.  We have a single Android phone and a $30 pre-pay plan with T-Mobile for going out.  We use a couple voip apps so we can have both of our numbers available on the phone.  Most of our calls and text messaging happen on our computers anyway.<p>We save on water by leaving the bathtub plugged up after our showers.  This water goes into buckets throughout the day to flush the toilets.  We never use the dishwasher and we wash laundry by hand when it's not a heavy load.  This saves us as much as $40/mo on our water bill.<p>We aren't poor and could live much more luxuriously, but we choose to live this way in order to gain a richer experience of life.",1350863391

Whether they be from Q, when.js, or even WinJS, you can use the simple composition rules of the Promises/A spec to build on promise behavior...<p>Unfortunately, libraries like jQuery break this. This necessitates ugly hacks to detect the presence of objects masquerading as promises, and who call themselves in their API documentation promises, but aren't really Promises/A promises. If the consumers of your API start trying to pass you jQuery promises, you have two choices: fail in mysterious and hard-to-decipher ways when your compositional techniques fail, or fail up-front and block them from using your library entirely.

4681204,comment,4680796,4680796,2,0,madiator,,,"I have been thinking about this issue a lot recently. Sometimes clutter seems unavoidable, such as when you want to learn or do something new. When I first got into photography, I started off with one DSLR and one lens. Then I kept adding lenses. Turns out I also need to clean the sensor since dust accumulates when you change lenses, so I ended up getting lens cleaning kit. Next, I had to upgrade my camera, because it was not sufficient for photoshoots (got invited to a few events non-professionally). Then you got to pay for websites, online storage, this and that. And then you get a bag, a tripod and the list is endless (I have been postponing buying the tripod). There was also a ripple effect. My laptop display was not only short for image editing, but it was displaying colors incorrectly. So I had to get a new monitor, and I had to spend extra time researching whether the colors will display correctly or not. All these add up. Sometimes I just want to sell everything and get one camera and one prime lens, but I am afraid of ""missing out"". May be thats not true. I haven't found the alternative. But for what its worth, I have had a good journey so far.<p>If one wants to reach a higher level than an amateur, it looks like extra items are unavoidable. Similar arguments go with say learning oil painting or say charcoal sketching.

(""shown"" not as a valid proof, but as ""noticed"" by people who can cast a vote)<p>In the long run, I believe it will end up costing much more by this self perpetrating demand, up to the point it actually damages the economy.<p>A dollar spent on healthcare is not ""productive"" - healthcare is an investment with a negative interest rate. You can only put more money to try to keep your capital - but in the end you still die (maybe that's the reason for the increasing marginal returns - you need more and more of it).<p>It's bad enough when a country make debts not for investment but for consumption, yet it's much worse to make debts to ""invest"" in something like healthcare - with a negative interest rate<p>European countries are in for a bad day when they won't be able to patch the system anymore.

A nyan cat generator? A social network for your dog's dog? Sure, throw 100+ hours into it, and maybe you'll get acquired by the 'social network for nyan cat generators'. The issue is that the tech industry more and more just serves itself, not because of the culture of funding but what I would think of is just familiarity. 100+ hours can go further elsewhere, but it's not necessarily the personal goal of that little coder.<p>Incremental steps only come when the larger incentives are in place. If you could flip a social enterprise (and not Facebook social, I mean for-a-better-world social), then people would be willing to spend 100 hours building apps for good.<p>The big dreamers are the ones who do it regardless of the fame, money, or glory.",1350860755

I had my first kid when I was 21, to say it was unplanned is an understatement, but marriage soon followed and things have really worked out the last 6 years luckily. I now have 2 kids and I'm 27, I'm also a single income for my family. I've been working on my Bootstrapped Startup with four others guys for two years, while it does get painful sometimes what I end up doing the most to handle everything is put off sleep. I probably get 4-6 hours during the week and try to make up for it by getting 8-10 on the weekends, but that rarely works with children (It's hard to be mad when two little kids jump on your head to wake you up because they want to play). We have big updates coming in the future that will hopefully take the site into the limelight, but until then it's a daily struggle and I love it.",1350860651

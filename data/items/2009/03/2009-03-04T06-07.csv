Any time someone uses a phrase like ""is in the best interests of the company"" I think of the movie ""Office Space"".<p>You see, every company has a culture, and culture is much more than slogans. If from the very beginning the employee felt like he couldn't speak up ""because it was not in his job description"" then there's something deeply wrong about the culture, slogan or not.",1236149919

502641,story,,,6,4,gsk,"Seeking advice: How to manage IP conflicts in a Startup?",,"I am teaming up with two other folks to create a software product. One of the person I am teaming up with runs a company already (legal consultancy). The product idea was originally his. His company will be the testing ground for the product and he will market it when we are ready to sell. He suggests that all the IP for the product we create be initially in the name of his existing company. When we are ready to sell, he says, he will transfer IP to the Startup. I am somewhat reluctant because I will be implementing the product (design, code) and would not be happy if I don't have equal stake from the beginning. Have you faced similar situations? How did you move forward?",1236149673

502625,comment,502552,502552,0,0,jd,,,"Interesting study that leads to a mundane/obvious conclusion. In the final paragraph it says:<p><pre><code>   These results go against some long held beliefs [...]
   that societies require specialisation to be productive
   and efficient. However, D'Orazio thinks that, at least 
   for biological purposes, the new model will set a
   standard for future work.
</code></pre>
In the cookie shop example -- wouldn't you say that an employee who can both make and sell cookies is still very specialized? Two specializations perhaps, but specialized nonetheless. Even if you don't take the second order benefits (that having several specializations leads to better insight/productivity in both tasks) into account any model that claims that specializing in one single thing is the optimal division of labor is clearly wrong.<p>In math-speak: the commonly held belief is that for any society without division of labor you can get to a better/more productive society by introducing some version of division of labor. The belief was never that for any society you can get a more productive society by increasing the division of labor. (Obviously false because specialization itself bears a cost [education, etc] and the marginal benefit of additional specialization decreases the more specialized somebody is, therefore there must be a point where additional specialization is actually harmful instead of beneficial. This contradicts the claim that specialization is unconditionally good.)<p>Mathematical model: nice.<p>New or counter intuitive results: not as far as I can tell.",1236148646

(We've used Quickbooks and didn't like it at all. 10 clicks to enter an expense, 20 clicks to enter a deposit. Awful.)<p>An effective way to sell a product is to sell on a pain point.

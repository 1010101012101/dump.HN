Chemistry is quite complicated if you break down the pill into it&#x27;s basic components it won&#x27;t tell you much. Even if you manage to isolate the active molecule you still will have to figure out the chemical process to make it and in a safe manner. 
Chemical patents tend to be quite long because it&#x27;s quite a complicated manner, and all of them have a full description of how the compound was identified, how it&#x27;s made, and how it&#x27;s delivered.<p>Now many drugs are also not as complicated as some people might think, the majority of the work that drug companies do it pretty much see what works for what, however for the complicated stuff that they actually R&D from the ground up the patents might be an actual liability when it comes to reverse engineering when they cannot use the law to enforce it.<p>As for the money, as long as rich people get sick drug companies will continue to do research, allot of the money for the research also comes from government grants and not from investments drug companies would rather produce drugs for illnesses that affect as many people as possible and drugs that combat the symptoms and not the cause where ever possible if we want to be completely cynical about it because that&#x27;s what would yield them the most amount of money.<p>If government and private grants weren&#x27;t available all we&#x27;ll get in a cynical world would be common cold and cold sore medicine that doesn&#x27;t really combat either viruses just prevents us from coughing and treats the sores.
And that is almost the world we are living in because drug companies and investors won&#x27;t be dumping resources into some obscure syndrome that affects 800 people in the US, for that we have the sick billionaires son and the sick nephew of a senator&#x27;s best friend to thank for.",1444431582

The same applies to devices and products used for circumventing DRM or removing rights management information (QQ.H.4(17)). Because multi-use devices such as computers are used for a diverse range of purposes, this is once again a disproportionate penalty. This could lead to a family&#x27;s home computer becoming seized simply because of its use in sharing files online, or for ripping Blu-Ray movies to a media center.</i>&quot;<p>Is TPM/DRM circumvention allowed for personal, non-commercial use?

The query language from RethinkDB is very powerful. But it&#x27;s nothing compared to SQL when it goes to expressiveness and performance (at least on PostgreSQL). ReQL is deceptive. It performs well as long as you don&#x27;t embed JavaScript or don&#x27;t do sophisticated joins (even based on indexes). When doing more complicated queries it becomes very ugly and slow.<p>Our main motivations for migration was:<p><pre><code>    * transactions
    * performance  
    * tool kits around SQL  
</code></pre>
We are very happy after migration. Backup process is way faster.
I think there is only one place where RethinkDB is better then PostgreSQL: replication + automatic failover.
If your data is not in TB, then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend Rethinkdb. World with relational DB, transactions, pl/sql, pub/sub, GiS, data constrains, stability... offered by PostgreSQL is way easier, reliable and offers better performance.",1444428168

You wouldn&#x27;t even need things like the console driver, because if a unikernel crashes, you just restart it, with crash logs sent somewhere for analysis. You can remove a lot of your networking stack, because your HTTP server, that only ever speaks http, can get rid of base things like UDP support. You don&#x27;t need a full-featured filesystem, because things are only written to at compile time. The number of syscalls you expose can equally be tiny. In short, you have an absolutely minuscule kernel.<p>From there, you can start stripping out other things. You don&#x27;t need a huge init system because all you&#x27;re doing is running a single application. Your libc can be made tiny, or removed completely, because you can strip it of all the calls your app doesn&#x27;t need. You don&#x27;t need to run an sshd, because there is no shell to get into. You can get rid of PAM because there&#x27;s no accounts to access or authenticate against.<p>On real machines and VMs, these things are necessary so you can run tests, do cleanup, etc. Unikernels are centered entirely around the idea that those things are someone else&#x27;s job, and if needed, can be shouted for across the network.",1444428093

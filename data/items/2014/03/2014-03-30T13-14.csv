Some tasks don&#x27;t fit the imperative model very well, some tasks have transactions open for days, some tasks need correlation across hundreds of different integrations, some tasks need to happen in guaranteed windows after initiated, some tasks need to be parallelised across lots of systems. These are a few cases I can think of.<p>From a current position perspective, we use MQs for quoting. Someone raises a quote, this is parallelised across 20 providers all with different integration methods, transformed back to a common object model, inserted as a single transaction into a database table, handed over to another system as an integration task which calculates risk, posted back from that to our system, a risk model is applied, the data is updated, the user is notified. This is all plugged into a 2 million line java and c# jumble that evolved over 15 years from a C++/COM nightmare.<p>We rewrote it with full test coverage in a month. We can add a new provider in an hour.<p>Imperative/table integration. No thanks!<p>People who distrust this methodology need to grab a copy of Enterprise Integration Patterns.

I pointed out a couple of examples where people do exactly that. Which is fine - you&#x27;re free to say that Supervisor McGoldrick is unfair. Just realize that you&#x27;re calling a <i>lot</i> of people unfair by your definition.<p>My point of bringing up those other arguments is to show that many people disagree with you. This means that you need to have a stronger basis for your argument, otherwise I&#x27;m free to treat it as an opinion that I can easily ignore.<p>You mention &quot;not being racist&quot; as a similar argument. But in the US it&#x27;s completely fair to demand that others conform with one&#x27;s racist ideas. I can hold a protest on the sidewalk in front of a store and demand that they only hire Trafalmadorians. People won&#x27;t respect me, and it would be illegal for the store to do so, but it&#x27;s completely fair that I make that demand and be able to protest peacefully. There is no law which prevents me from being racist and ignoring Trafalmadorians that I meet on the street. Those laws you talk about deal with government, businesses, education, public accommodation, etc. but not individual people. (Otherwise it would be a free speech and right to assemble violation. Hence why there are still racist private clubs.)<p>If I were were a Jain, who believes that not even insects should be killed, I might demand that the president step down because he killed a fly once on TV.<p>If I were strongly anti-fur, it&#x27;s fair for me to demand that someone step down at CEO for wearing a coon-skin cap at a private Halloween party.<p>If I were an absolute teetotaler, I might demand that a CEO resign because he enjoys a beer every once in a while in his spare time, while I believe that no one in a position of responsibility should ever drink alcohol.<p>I am completely of the opinion that anyone can call for the resignation of someone else based on &quot;99% or OWS, or gun laws or whatever&quot;.<p>What&#x27;s &quot;unfair&quot; about those? Nothing. I say that none of these demands, including a demand based on one&#x27;s political contributions to a state constitutional amendment, are not at all &quot;unfair&quot;. &quot;Unrealistic&quot;, certainly, but there&#x27;s nothing intrinsically unfair about these demands.<p>So my opinion is that all of these are &quot;fair&quot;. Your opinion is that some are &quot;unfair&quot;. It&#x27;s easy to find people who disagree with you. So now we&#x27;ve got dozens of opinions.<p>You also mention that people who make these unfair arguments are bullying. Would you explain that logic?

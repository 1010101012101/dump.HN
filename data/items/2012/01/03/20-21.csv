3421256,comment,3420203,3420944,0,0,j45,,,"I started entirely where you were.  It was the only skill I really had that people were willing to pay for.  I could diagnose, fix and permanently repair/prevent future issues, whether it was software, hardware, networking, IT support/consulting, fixing viruses.   Back then the tools weren't so good, though.<p>One of the big 'aha' moments I had was when I didn't have to bill my customer minimum 1 hour to drive to their site if they were in town.   I offered to bill in quarter hour increments if I could try addressing it remotely, and if it didn't work, I'd come in.  Having the keys to everyones offices is something I didn't enjoy, remote access made it a bit easier.<p>The other key 'ahas' that helped me transition from IT work to more software work were:<p>- Work to always replace myself.  Most IT / developer types are of two categories. The ones that make you dependant on them, and the ones that make you independent.  The consultants that charge you to do windows patches every month on purpose do it because that's often the ceiling of their talent.  The consultants that are bored to tears by doing windows patches but do it to get other work with the customer often automate it to a point that they can say ""spend the money you would on patching on other projects with me instead and I will always automate IT as much as possible"".<p>- Solid Email based Case manager - This is the only piece of software that changed my life. One item per case number, tie it to a billing system. If you do go this route, make sure you use a solid email based case manager like Fogbugz (or anything) that is well suited to keeping your work visible in their inbox since they don't see your face much.  For me, Fogbugz found me when I juggled too many things manually and I've been loyal since.  There are several other capable tools too, find which one speaks to you the best.<p>The toolsets for managing things centrally (remote access, antivirus, firewalls) are so much more polished and integrated, if you can get your business doing remote IT support/maintenance, there is a good business there.<p>If this is a field you enjoy and want to continue growing, feel free to hit me up, I'll totally give you everything I've ever learnt or known about this so you can scale up to a .5-1 million/year revenue business pretty easily.",1325624237

3421249,comment,3420184,3420184,0,0,FuzzyDunlop,,,"Using the right tool for the job comes to mind here, but half the time you can only see this with hindsight. And the other half the time, I'd guess, PHP is the only tool available. Unless cheap webhosts offer Python, Ruby and Node.js integration to complement the usual feature-set.<p>If you have more tools in the box, then you can start to consider whether to go full-stack with PHP (I'd no longer consider this route a viable option), or whether to modularise your project. Maybe for a lot of things that's too much and a PHP framework that does it all is totally fine. No point doing something just because you can, but you have the flexibility to think outside of the box when refactoring.<p>This is exactly what I did when it came to generating an image and manipulating the output. In PHP it was convoluted, buggy, impossible to understand the library it depended upon, and offered no flexibility. It took months of procrastination and avoidance before we had to get the feature working, so I ditched the lot and re-did it in Python, using Cyclone and a couple of lightweight libs. It took a day and a half to implement, with no knowledge beforehand, and it does absolutely everything we wanted (without any hacks).<p>It was at that point I realised that it was much more beneficial to look beyond the one-size-fits-all solution of a massive framework, which may be appropriate to some, but just as often isn't. And as has been said - very well indeed I must add - I don't want to be a [framework]-developer who knows not so much the language, but an individual or group's abstraction of it; I want to be a developer who knows what to do when that framework doesn't fit.",1325624177

So if you want people to see publishing in your conference as a valuable addition to their CVs, you need to have a <30% acceptance rate, preferably more like 10-15%, so you can be counted as a ""very selective"" conference.

IE6 doesn't support a lot of standards that other browsers supported, mainly due to not keeping up with changing standards.<p>>If it wasn't for the law, we could forget about the blind too?<p>Note that I said ""being blind is rarely a choice"", implying that we should code for the blind because they did not choose their limitations. If you're forced to use IE6 in a corporate environment, it's because the designer of a web app wrote it for IE6, not for ""the internet Tim Berners Lee had in mind"". No one is forcing you to use entertainment-based web apps at work, in fact your management might discourage it.<p>>I don't think that was the progress that Tim Berners Lee had in mind. A progress where HTML documents from the HTML5 era become inaccessible to later generations.<p>And you think that the designers of floppy disks intended for them to be thrown out when USB drives came into existence? <i>THIS IS PROGRESS</i> This is what progress does. Technology changes. Don't code for current technology, code for maintainability. If your code works on IE6 but is broken in newer browsers, <i>your code is broken by design</i>. There <i>is</i> a standard, and code that follows it will work in browsers that respect it. IE6 does neither.<p>You honestly seem to be arguing that IE6 was a perfectly compatible browser and was the pinnacle of browser design.

And hence the exhortation to produce novel, correct, and significant work if they want to get published.<p>You couldn't be more wrong.<p>The ""very low acceptance rate"" which the OP laments means the exact opposite of what you seem to have understood. Namely: In most of the better CS conferences and journals, the number of submissions which make or exceed the grade is so _large_ compared to the number of available slots for publication that a significant amount of ""novel, correct, and significant"" work has to be routinely rejected. Just because the conference/journal has its physical limitations. It is a problem of plenty, not of scarcity. As an example, see the Forward of the proceedings of last year's STACS [1] :<p>""The STACS 2011 call for papers led to 271 submissions from 45 countries. ... there were intense and interesting discussions.

3421189,comment,3419837,3419837,0,0,ssivark,,,"I know a li'l bit of physics, so I'll add my two cents. Most such articles (including this one) are overly hyped. While the findings might be interesting to another theoretical physicist working in the same area, it's a long while before such things are of any relevance to the public... for the calculations might have mistakes or subtleties; quite possible since people don't understand things fully and we're trying to discover new physics.<p>With regards to the actual feasibility of such a test, let me say this: It's taken us about half a century to ""probably"" identify a couple of black holes. Trying to find a few that were created early enough to be evaporating now and then observing their radiation signature seems to be an extremely long shot. The article also claims that the method needs ""enough"" black holes, which I'm guessing is more than a few. We're talking of things which occur on astronomical time scales. Since our current technology lets us look only in our near neighbourhood (in space and time) i.e. not too far away and not too far back in time, we need to be extremely lucky to be able to verify that claim. And that would be an understatement.<p>PS: Hawking radiation is a semi-classical calculation of how black holes must radiate. So pretty much everybody working in related areas knows that the exact radiation observed will be slightly different due to corrections coming from ""quantum mechanics done right"". That's nothing new. This paper gives one such scheme of corrections and claims that this is a distinguishing feature of loop quantum gravity. (As stated in the article; I can't verify that claim)",1325622832

My requirement for using third-party libraries are that they do a single thing, that they do it well, and that they have little or no dependencies. There's no good reason why most third-party code can't be a single class / file.<p>Our third-party library stack for the (very complex) chartboost.com architecture is made up of simple, modular parts: Paraglide as micro-MVC (one class, and a handful of folder for the base structure), MongoModel (one class, as MongoDB ORM), etc. Most of our third-party libraries are very simple and manageable, the way all PHP should be.<p>As for code verbosity: everything is auto-loaded on the fly when needed. Our code has practically no `require` statements. We just follow a simple conventions of where to place files and how to name classes, and everything works smoothly and painlessly.<p>Most importantly in this setup, none of the libraries depend on the framework of choice or on anything architectural. The framework doesn't even require being run in a web environment. This lets us do powerful and flexible things like use Facebook's `phpsh` library to open up a shell that will have our entire environment available and loaded on the fly. We can also switch between dev, production or local environments on the fly.",1325622586

This is the sort of non-tech article I still really enjoy finding on hn.<p>That said, I'm not sure it's supposed to be such a surprise that, after a certain level, more $$ != ""better""... I'm not an expert, but from talking to experienced musicians, I get the feeling that when they pay top $ for a hand-crafted musical instrument (or anything, really), what they're really seeking is a higher degree of specialization, rather than a higher quality per se.  Mass production doesn't necessarily make things <i>worse</i>, it just makes them all the same (with a corresponding drop in price due to efficiencies of scale).  Once top musicians get to a certain level with their instrument, they start to seek out specific qualities in their instrument, and they can only find them in custom ordered or instruments that are harder to find (ie., more expensive).<p>I feel a little sheepish saying this, because I'm speaking for others - I'm nowhere near the level where it would make the slightest bit of sense for me to plunk down $5-10k or more (and it can easily be more, way more).  And of course, what I said above assumes a certain level of quality in the ""mass produced"" instruments - we're not talking about super cheap factory made crap.<p>Quick edit - the point I'm making probably doesn't really apply to the massive price difference between a Stradivarius and more recently made violins, though... the premium probably does have to do with a perception that it is ""better""... my point is that I don't think ""better"" is always what drives the decision to spend more on an instrument.",1325621126

What's racist is your assumption that hadn't you (an implicitly superior culture, which is also a somewhat racist idea) told them what natural resource they had under their feet and taught them how to explore it they'd never figure it out for themselves and would be a primitive society. You imply that they are somehow better off because of it when, in fact, the money the country got for its riches was funneled to a small group of religious fundamentalists that, because of it, are able to rule the country unquestioned. One could argue they still have a very primitive society, only now they have money and weapons. You also imply they would never be able to develop the tools used to glean the data, an assumption that's also probably untrue and fail to mention the fact that most script-kids who pull tricks like this around the planet have no knowledge of the inner workings of the tools they use and would never be able to develop them from scratch.<p>And finally, I did not comment on Saudi Arabia's form of government, its repressive laws or the sadly misguided idiots who pulled this trick and their ideas about how the world works.

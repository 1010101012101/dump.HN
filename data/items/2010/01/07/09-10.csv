1036805,comment,1036509,1036761,0,0,wisty,,,"We seem to be at loggerheads on two points.<p>1 - I'm focusing on basic proficiency (a bottom up approach - you learn the basics then the hard stuff is easy), you are focusing on learning through break-through discoveries (the top-down approach). (I may be creating a false hierarchy, but I'm going to run with it).<p>2 - I am focusing on teachers directly teaching students, while you focus on teaching students to be self-motivated learners.<p>Now, I can't think of any way to teach self-motivated break-through learning. The closest thing I can think of is to make subjects interesting (getting teachers who are enthusiastic about the subject, and providing interesting text books (yeah-right)), and give the students free time to pursue their own interests (which is why I half-jokingly suggested outlawing homework). The other model I've seen (don't teach properly so students have to learn) seems a little perverse to me.<p>(oh, the basic facts -> simple application -> creative use? Fact - past tense. Simple application - what did Spot do? Creative (or complex) use - Why did Spot do it?)",1262858350

It is striking that <i>both</i> means of expressing large numbers of ideas - vocabulary and syntax - only occur in us. I would guess that they were driven by the same evolutionary pressures and benefits.<p>There was an article about a (potentially) intermediate ""proto-syntax"" language used by an animal.

I've done some experiments with implementing the Knuth & Plass line breaking algorithm (as used in TeX) in JavaScript, and it seems to outperform the browser line breaking algorithm on quality. I guess browsers use a simple line breaking algorithm for performance, but I hope that choice is revisited some day because a good line breaking algorithm makes text much easier to read.<p>If you're interested you can find my experiments at:\n<a href=""http://www.bramstein.com/projects/typeset/myfit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bramstein.com/projects/typeset/myfit.html</a>",1262857978

For the Nook this turned out to be deliberate, as any semblance of real user speed would've exposed the embarrassingly slow software that was completely unable to respond in real-time.<p>Hopefully Windows' performance and response time would be better than this video makes me fear.

It is not impossible with dynamic scope - but problem is again accidental name clash. As it is the same problem as with macros - I guess it can be solved on similar way - using functions with generated unusual and unique names of variables.<p>On the other side, with dynamic scope, functions are as expressive (or almost) as macros and they are the first class values.

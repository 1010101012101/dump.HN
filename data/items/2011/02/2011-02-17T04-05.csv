In floating-point, zero values represent not only the exact value zero but the result of an underflowed computation too small to represent as a non-zero floating point value, so retaining the sign is often important to at least keep such computations on the correct side of a branch cut or limit.

The SEC does not seem to have resources to tackle all their cases. So when it makes an announcement that its going after someone, it usually means that they have a case, and the evidence to back it up. Conversely, it means they go after only strong cases.<p>For example - the SEC's prosecution of Goldman. It was panned in the media, and Goldman even stated they would fight the case. The media actually posted it as SEC being irresponsible and hunting for scalps. On the other hand, one site pointed out that Khuzami wouldn't be bringing a weak case and that Goldman was most likely going to settle -<p><a href=""http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/04/10-things-you-dont-know-gs-case/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/04/10-things-you-dont-know...</a>

Many of these mortgage-backed securities are coming under scrutiny for not being properly ""mortgage-backed"" at all.<p>When created proper paperwork trails were not kept, and the notes and mortgages were split (which is a no-no in some states) and proper records were not filed at the county level. In a lot of cases county and state law was just wholesale ignored through the MERS system.<p>None of this is ever a problem unless you actually need to collect on the home that serves as collateral for your note. Apparently some in Wall St didn't think far enough ahead. This is beginning to work its way through the courts and will open a whole new bag of worms for those holding these notes at par.<p>Just one example (of many) :<a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-06/foreclosures-may-be-undone-by-massachusetts-ruling-on-mortgage-transfers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-06/foreclosures-may-be...</a><p>So not only did the 'system' encourage the writing of irresponsible mortgages and scummy sales tactics, the banks also defrauded their customers: state endowments, pension plans, universities and other purchasers of these improperly structured financial products.<p>Yet this is all a civil matter and nobody will go to jail. Chalk another one up to the 'best and the brightest' of Wall St.<p>The author is a bit sloppy, but their heart is in the right place.

2229803,comment,2228419,2228419,0,0,EGreg,,,"I see this as a steady development towards a new era, away from copyright and patents and towards distribution-driven innovation.<p>Look at Netflix, Apple and Google. They are discovering this model but just like the internet, I think the future will reveal itself over the next few years. People will pay for easy distribution and one-click purchasing. Some distribution networks will have a monthly fee for unlimited downloads. Others will have pay-per-download.<p>Here's the good news: rather than relying on a government-enforced monopoly (copyright, patents, etc.) to make sure that the publishers and innovators get paid, we will rely on direct-to-consumer distribution networks, which compete with one another for publishers and users on things like ease of use and selection.<p>In a way this is the Cable TV model. Eventually, I think everyone will move to a monthly subscription model for nearly unlimited downloads, like Netflix. That's because when torrent clients (or usenet or whatever else decentralized distribution network there will be) become as easy to use as the centralized ones (and decentralized always wins in the end), it will be just as easy and convenient to get a pirated movie as it is to get it on iTunes. But movies are expensive to make. That's why in the future, I think people will pay monthly fees instead of paying per item.<p>At the end of the day, there will be a huge number of people subscribed to Netflix-like distribution networks just like there are people subscribed to the internet, and generating ""positive externalities"" for the cheapskates that get free content through decentralized means. But the system will work. Content creators will flourish!",1297918132

Generally people making purchasing decisions aren't thinking in terms of those kinds of ranges; they simply have a maximum budget in mind.  I think it's better to allow users to specify ""under $5"", ""under $10"", etc. so that each successive group includes the previous groups.  I realize there may be a case for trying to get customers to purchase the most expensive item they're willing to purchase, but more often than not having to click each range separately just annoys me and I leave the page.",1297918126

Electrophoretic displays can go at very fast refresh rates if you just zap them hard enough (i.e. high voltage on the TFT). Without higher voltage they can still run fast but at the expense of losing contrast. You basically have little black and white ""balls"" (electrophoretic particles) travel up and down in the field (in those little e-ink cells). At conventional voltage the balls won't travel the full distance in a single fast image frame, so you won't get full black or full white. The problem is that people want colour, speed and low power consumption. Those are opposing requirements and E-ink made their bet on power (at the expense of colour and speed).",1297917086

2229693,comment,2229559,2229559,0,0,appregattaken,,,"hi - all the startups i work with are B2B.  gotta tell you that A LOT depends on type of solution you're selling, the types of companies in the industries you're targeting (are they typically early adopters, Luddites, etc.), are you going large enterprise or small businesses, how many users will have to use the solution, is security important... i could go on and on but this is core to B2B approach.<p>best advice i could offer in this situation from an appregatta perspective is get yourself positioned with someone that already has access to the customers you're trying to reach (a consulting firm with domain expertise, a reseller, etc.).  ask them to be your product experts and hook you up with just a few prospects.  there are real tricks to this to get it to work but it's doable and i see it work all the time.<p>another often viable option is to sell a very small piece of work as a consulting deal, and provide the prospect with real and tangible deliverables in terms of what they will get... if they get to ""try out"" a product also, all the better for them.  but the deliverable is often an assessment and process improvement recommendations. if it's a real problem, they're likely to be willing to pay $500, $2,500, $10,000 for a consulting gig if you're team is credible and the pain is real.  done right, mini consulting gigs can be easier to get meetings for and get deep into dialogue about nature of the probs at the very early stages.<p>so much is situational with B2B selling, it's borderline not even appropriate for me to offer much.  but hopefully this gets you thinking and pushes your process forward a bit.<p>congrats on the biz and best of luck!",1297915539

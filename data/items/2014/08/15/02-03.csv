Avoiding that work is what this is about.<p>The fact that computer graphics from 1996 are still taught as if it was 1996 should be greater cause for concern.

Just a few pain points:<p>1) Mono hasn&#x27;t been updated for <i>five years</i> due to licensing issues on iOS. GC pauses with a complex game can be hundreds of milliseconds, being stop the world non generational.<p>2) A similar story of PhysX, though I can&#x27;t pin down the exact date, 2010 at the latest<p>3) They added a new particle system with flashy features, but <i>no scripting access</i>. I don&#x27;t even...<p>4) Unity 4 added next to nothing useful (DX11 naturally on Windows only, Mechanim which was broken etc), though it was necessary to purchase to keep getting bug fixes<p>5) No 64 bit editor is very painful (I have 32gb of ram laying around doing nothing)<p>6) The project is riddled with bugs, being added and removed each release, though probably <i>much less</i> than hacky in house solutions which are the norm in the game industry<p>7) Nasty serialization formats make programatically changing the hundreds of meta files in a project next to impossible<p>However, I&#x27;m getting the impression that the new Unreal licensing scheme has been a real kick in the ass for UT, and they&#x27;re taking the competition seriously. Nearly every major problem I&#x27;ve had with Unity seems to be being worked on now, for Unity 5, after a long period of atrophy.<p>I fully expected Unity to die a slow death, and that it was just a question of when to switch to something else (there is not much high quality competition), but now I&#x27;m not so sure. If they pull off their roadmap, it&#x27;ll finally be an engine I will be happy to use and recommend. Right now my feeling is: it does the job, mostly.<p>Note that the experience making small puzzle games for iOS etc may be very different, I&#x27;ve done that kind of thing but not with Unity.",1408071472

There&#x27;s a vibrant community of game and 3d artists supporting eachother, giving out free assets, free help, free advice, tutorials ETC. I take issue with your broad assertion that artists don&#x27;t support free culture.<p>When it comes to assets, it&#x27;s tough to put together a library of free, or even purchased ones, because the style, poly count, texture resolution, texture mood, art direction ETC just won&#x27;t be consistent across assets. We even purchased a couple of low-priority models and found that it took more time to fix them and bring them up to MartianCraft standards than it would have taken for us to design, re-topologize and texture assets ourselves.<p>Furthermore, almost everything needs to be designed and and built for specific layouts and proportions. If that pillar is a little too tall or not tall enough, you can&#x27;t just scale it up as it will stretch the textures and look terrible.

It was limited to the elite, and as a result there was a great scarcity of people who were able to become lawyers. They could then charge a lot of money for their services and become rich.<p>This changed as soon as law schools became the dumping ground for people who wanted to become professionals but sucked at math. Can&#x27;t do engineering? Programming&#x27;s a bitch? Your lab grades suck too much to get into med school? Law school will take you!

You can&#x27;t quit; you&#x27;re lucky to have the job in the first place, and you have $250k of debt. Okay, so BigLaw is out if you don&#x27;t want to be driven to a nervous breakdown. How about being a public attorney? $35k a year salary. Okay, that sucks... how about being an ambulance chasing personal injury lawyer?

The ones who do almost universally say that they wouldn&#x27;t do it over again if they had the opportunity.<p>The organizations that profit from this? BigLaw and the law schools. BigLaw firms profit immensely because they have a massive supply of new lawyers who will take anything that&#x27;s given to them. 90 hour weeks? Thank you sir, may I have another! I have student loans to pay!<p>The law schools also make a killing because, like many other colleges, they&#x27;ve managed to convince people that a college degree is The One True Path to attaining the American Dream.

Sampling at 200Hz means your masimum detectable frequency is 100Hz, per the Nyquist theorem - that&#x27;ll capture ~40% of the typical male frequency range (fundamental only - not enough for harmonics or formants) and little or nothing of the typical female frequency range. I question the claimed 65% success rate, and would like to know a lot more about the experimental conditions before I&#x27;d be inclined to accept it.

Many of today&#x27;s applications have no &quot;offline&quot; mode.  Network availability and performance is assumed.  Just as back in the 90&#x27;s it became assumed that the user would have a capable PC.  A &quot;slow&quot; PC would not run the latest software.<p>Many of the applications I write for my own use require very little computing power... I develop on a modestly powered machine and so my programs can run fast from old hardware if need be (i.e., can&#x27;t afford the latest gear).  My approach to &quot;apps&quot; is to periodically download bulk data from the network to keep the application updated, and this usually is scheduled for off-peak times when costs and congestion are lower.  Fast network speeds and inexpensive local storage are much appreciated when performing these updates.  Not to mention the ease of obtaining an internet globally reachable IP address through today&#x27;s &quot;cloud hosting&quot; providers.<p>But I will never understand today&#x27;s &quot;app&quot; and &quot;web API&quot; trends.  Developers of these &quot;apps&quot; utilize the costs of storage and bandwidth a different way.  Storage is mainly remote (on someone else&#x27;s machines, not yours), and hence controlled by some third party, not the user.   And most of these applications I see are designed to make constant piecemeal downloads, minute by minute, hour after hour, day after day (even if the same information has been requested before) when they could just as well download all the data they will ever need once, and periodically update it during off-peak periods.  As such, if the network is congested or down at runtime, the user must suffer it out.  Of course, by making a call to the remote network every time the user takes some action, third parties are able to track everything a user does.  That, and the whole app/api approach to development has value to some people perhaps, but surely it is not users. \nFor example, when I watch YouTube videos, I have an application that downloads them first, storing them on RAM disk or inexpensive local media storage and then serving them over a local network.  I can then play them using whatever device suits me (or store them on any other device if I wish).  I never see any ads.  I never use Javascript or Flash.  And I never have playback issues (because among other things I have control over my local network).  This approach seems like common sense but I feel like I am probably one of the only people out there who does this... and it is not difficult at all to do.",1408068998

You get to inspect the state of objects while they are running, you can modify it, and you can modify <i>method bodies</i> while they are running. Scary stuff.<p>In Python some nice meta-programming code lives in Django ORM, in Model metaclass, and in Fields. This is the code which allows you to declaratively define your models as classes. Similar code is used in Django Forms.<p>The talk &quot;Five years of bad ideas&quot; by Armin Ronacher is a 40-minuted tour of some of the most advanced meta-programming available in Python.<p>In JavaScript every library which implements &quot;classical classes&quot; on top of objects and prototypes uses meta-programming. You can read about it more in depth in Raganwald &quot;the art of javascript meta-object protocol&quot; and his other talks and posts.<p>Angular.js dependency injection framework is based on meta-programming; actually I  had a mixed reaction when I saw the code for this, where they rewrite a user supplied function as a string and compile a new function out of this string. It&#x27;s a good example of meta-programming, but it&#x27;s also very crude compared to hygienic macros in Schemes for example.

All you&#x27;ve provided me is a point of view without anything resembling rational reasoning. I believe that trains can fly. You don&#x27;t have to believe me, but now you have another data point for your consideration.<p>> this kind of criticism is impossible to defend against.<p>See my initial statement. All you have to do is point flaws in the above link.<p>> To prove that it&#x27;s mostly bullshit would take me literally writing a book - in which I would surely make mistakes,<p>If you&#x27;re not confident in your ability to assess and refute an argument, then why bother making it?<p>>  that then could be used to discredit it entirely in a single article.<p>Nobody is saying the article above is perfectly written, or that the critique is 100% on point, but that does not mean the broad point he makes has no merit. Same would be true for the hypothetical book you write.<p>> When people read a powerful criticism &quot;debunking&quot; things about a group they vaguely know, the default for most is to agree with the criticism. For some reason it&#x27;s natural to humans.<p>Do you have any basis on which you&#x27;re making that claim? No, because if you did, you&#x27;d provide that.<p>>  All I want now is to make people stop for at least a moment, consider that the article may be unfair, and to not make judgments before double-checking the claims.<p>But WHY? <i></i>WHY<i></i>? You&#x27;ve, objectively, given me ZERO reason besides &quot;it&#x27;s malicious and people are biased when reading debunking articles&quot;. You&#x27;ve clearly refused to engage in the content. You haven&#x27;t even quoted a single line and proved that it&#x27;s false. Whereas the article in question is an in-depth exploration of the community of people, their beliefs, the personalities involved, what they believe, their education background and many more things. What have you done? Nada.<p>I can go on and tear down your whole reply, but I&#x27;ll stop here.I come off with the impression that you&#x27;re taking this personally and therefore, as a natural response, you&#x27;re defending it, which is fine. I&#x27;m not trying to be a dick, but perhaps you should work on your argumentation and logic skills before trying to defend or take any side.",1452088761

No interaction with facebook, at all, except one messenger session with a design contractor who is doing our UI overhaul. I haven&#x27;t been so productive in years. And, it mostly broke my facebook addiction...I check it once a day now, often just on my phone while standing in line at the grocery or during some other downtime. I&#x27;m able to ignore it most of the time (notifications have been turned off for years, because I hate anything dinging at me and interrupting my thought process; I leave the ringer on my phone off for the same reason, I can check my voicemail in Google Voice a couple times a day to deal with important stuff).<p>I&#x27;m considering doing the same &quot;fast and then reduced consumption&quot; for my other social media habits: reddit, HN, twitter. When I traveled full-time, in the past, I would often find myself with little or no Internet connectivity for a week at a time, and that imposed periodic social media fasting, and it was sufficient to keep the addictions in check. After living in a fixed house, with very fast Internet, for a little over a year, the urge to check my phone/tablet first thing in the morning and last thing at night has become notable and annoying.<p>In short: He&#x27;s right, and I notice my own inability to do things of substance has been significantly impaired by the time and attention I give to social media, and it&#x27;s only reasonable to abstain in the interest of spending more time doing the things I truly value. It can be hard to make that choice, however...one more shot of dopamine (or whatever chemicals the constant affirmation of social media provides) seems harmless.<p>(I note the irony of this being an HN comment.)",1452088309

These people move around, and personal relationships are really important long term.  This is my main motivating factor.<p>As long as the client pays (20% of revenue...) and there are no other risks, I&#x27;m happy to employ a front end developer who has probably has years of experience making IE6/7 degrade somewhat gracefully.  If it were my own product, my own time, my own cost, absolutely not, but if sales were assured with this type of customer, sure.<p>This is a personal opinion.  No one client is the same.  I find it interesting to contrast  2 clients I work with who are in differing fields of the same space: (massive names in) financial services:  One does QA on only the latest stable version of major browsers (down to Opera, my personal favourite) browser on Windows and Mac; The other does QA on any browser or platform with 2% visitor share (measured by visitors to their website), and also accommodates customers who may be on something obscure but the customer demands it.  The former&#x27;s approach sounds pretty aggressive r.e. serving, or not serving, the customer, but the latter&#x27;s caused them to avoid abandoning a really backward platform for 5+ years for all customers.

That only increases the chances of abuse, it does not diminish them at all. Just like in Nazi Germany there were plenty of people still fighting the good fight <i>and</i> at the same time employed by government. No government will ever be 100% rotten.

The way these things work is that the general course will be slightly affected by the individuals but the momentum in the whole machinery is enormous. Think of it as a cable in which individual strands are replaced but the identity and purpose of the cable remains. Eventually you have a completely new cable and yet, nothing has changed. And in this case the entity has a huge influence on which parts of it will be replaced by who.<p>> It looks to me like the US agencies, and the Five Eyes in general, are capable people who are just doing their jobs.<p>That&#x27;s a very very scary thing to say. &quot;Just doing my job&quot; has been used time and again historically to distance oneself from the responsibility taken when performing certain actions.

You don&#x27;t get 100% safety, but it&#x27;s still leaps and bounds better than what the C standard library provide (a foot to shoot yourself in the gun with).<p>You may be that legendary programmer who writes code &quot;without bugs&quot; and everything works correctly on the first run. I don&#x27;t doubt a handful of &quot;real programmers&quot; like that exist. But most of us make mistakes, and we want the compiler to protect us. Just look at the endless stream of memory-related vulnerabilities at CERT. Nearly all of them could have been prevented in a memory-safe language.<p>2) That is a non-issue. All serious standard libraries define operation complexity at the Big O granularity. Sometimes they go even further and the spec (especially in C++&#x27;s case) gurantees some implementation details.<p>Anyway, if you&#x27;re not happy with the proper characteristic of a standard data structure for a certain use, there&#x27;s nothing preventing you from creating your own data structure with your preferred behavior pattern. You can even use an &#x27;unsafe&#x27; override - at least you&#x27;d isolate unsafety to a very small and manageable part of the code that way.<p>3) Again, nothing prevents you from optimizing for special cases. But that are many more programs (e.g. parsers) that deal with short and repetetive strings which can benefit from an implementation that passes them as value-types on the stack (this is essentially which most C++ implementations do).<p>4. I&#x27;m all for a default unicode string type and a separate &quot;raw bytes&quot; type. But the you should either store the string as unicode codepoints (UTF-32) or as UTF-8.

I use toggl — <a href=""https://www.toggl.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.toggl.com/</a> — to track my time throughout the day. I&#x27;d work 12 hours a day if I could, but I can&#x27;t. I run out of gas after 2 hours, 3 hours — and sometimes 8 hours. My limit on tedious, fussy, boring tasks is about 2 hours, after which I&#x27;m not much good for anything. My limit when I&#x27;m writing a book is 3 to 4 hours. If I&#x27;m building something out of code or working in Photoshop, sometimes I get addicted, and then I can go 8 hours. Addiction seems to be the only thing that gets me close to being as productive as I&#x27;d like to be. Sadly, I can&#x27;t choose to focus only on the types of tasks that I&#x27;m addicted to.<p>My sense is that most people — probably including your boss — have never measured how much cognitive work they themselves can do before their brain is fried. I&#x27;m talking about real work, not meetings. Meetings use almost no brain glucose at all, so are a way to pad &quot;working&quot; hours without increasing fatigue substantially. I&#x27;m convinced this is why meetings are so popular in corporate America.<p>As long as no one is measuring, it&#x27;s easy for everyone to kid themselves that they&#x27;re good for 8 hours and that everyone else should be, no matter how unrealistic that may be.",1452085477

10850244,comment,10847842,10850135,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> The problem with drawing historical parallels is that they never apply exactly.<p>They don&#x27;t have to. History only happens <i>once</i>, if you refuse to learn from history because it is not an exact repetition of the past then you can never make any progress.<p>> Saying &quot;A thing happened in the past&quot; can be instructive, especially to people who didn&#x27;t even realize that the thing was possible.<p>You seem to think it isn&#x27;t possible because of &quot;insert magical reason why everything is different now here&quot;, not just that it can&#x27;t happen again for whatever reason. That&#x27;s an impossible position to argue with. All the weight of history would not be able to sway you from that position because nothing can counter magic.<p>> But what&#x27;s much more practically useful is to say &quot;I think what happened before will happen again in the current context and for these reasons&quot;. An example from the past is only useful if it can be tangibly connected to the current situation, right now in the present.<p>No practical examples will counter your magic. You will either say &#x27;that&#x27;s not the same exactly&#x27; or &#x27;that&#x27;s too long ago to be relevant&#x27; and so on.<p>The only thing that will convince you is when you&#x27;re lifted out of your bed at 3 am and we never hear from you again. By then it will be a bit too late, but you too will be a believer in government abuse if and when that happens.<p>Until then you&#x27;re going to head straight for the last stanza of Martin Niemoeller&#x27;s most quoted lines. The vast majority of the people living in the former DDR were never lifted from their beds at 3am for interrogation. To them life was just a-ok.<p>> I can&#x27;t think of a case where stable and mature democratic bureaucracy has ever used surveillance to influence the majority of its populace.<p>That&#x27;s not a bad thing per se. Meanwhile, you&#x27;re trying hard to change that number from &#x27;0&#x27; into &#x27;1&#x27; by allowing the present level of abuse to spread unfettered, which invariable leads to an escalation. Each and every <i>click</i> that you hear is one of a ratchet, it will not voluntarily click back again, it can only go forward until on that scale between &#x27;0&#x27; and &#x27;police state&#x27; you&#x27;ve gotten close enough to &#x27;police state&#x27; that there is no relevant difference.<p>It can&#x27;t happen here is a very dangerous line of thought. See the movie &#x27;the wave&#x27; for some more poignant illustrations of how that thought is a dangerous thing all by itself. It can happen here, it might happen here, and it likely <i>will</i> happen here unless we&#x27;re vigilant.<p>> Germany in the early 20th century was a very instable government in a bad economic situation.<p>ok<p>> Soviet East Germany was communist, which isn&#x27;t quite the kind of democratic that I meant.<p>Yes, and like that there will always be one last thing that is not quite the same which will allow you to look the other way.<p>> It&#x27;s true that any government could turn bad, in the same way that anything is possible.<p>I would consider that progress, hold that thought.<p>> But there&#x27;s very little evidence for that in the current context.<p>That depends on where you are looking. There is plenty of evidence that pressure is being applied, but the pressure is applied subtly enough and in places far enough away from the focal points where change is effected that you&#x27;d be hard pressed to connect the dots. That&#x27;s the beauty of having a lot of information at your disposal.<p>A nice example is the Iraq war, the run up to that saw massive world wide resistance in the populations of the countries of the &#x27;coalition of the willing&#x27; whereas later on this was described as the coalition of the &#x27;gullible, the bribed and the <i>coerced</i>&#x27;.<p>> So my position is this: Given that I live in the United States in 2016<p>The United States does not hold a privileged position in the world, and it does not matter whether it is 2016, 1938 or 1912. For everybody living in the past in places where these experiments went wrong they could have written &quot;given that I live in X in Y&quot; and they&#x27;d be accurate about that.<p>> I&#x27;m not worried about the government randomly deciding to screw with me by looking at my electronic communications<p>They might have substituted &#x27;electronic&#x27; with &#x27;written&#x27;.<p>> and acting on them. It just doesn&#x27;t make sense. I&#x27;m not significant relative to the scale of the US government, the government itself just doesn&#x27;t work that way and all of the negative scenarios I&#x27;ve heard seem to be very contrived.<p>They again would not have used US government but whatever place they lived in. And they would have been dead wrong, and in some cases, when the fog lifted they&#x27;d have simply been dead.<p>What seems contrived for you, living in a country that has never seen actual war on its own soil (sorry, your civil war does not count), that exports war on an ongoing basis, that uses IT to kill people by remote control, that used telephone taps, burglary and threats to affect they inner workings of its own government to me seems to be willful blindness.<p>For some reason it is more convenient to you to re-write all of history up to and including the present rather than to see that maybe your government is not all that benign, neither on the world stage (where they are a bit more overt about their intent) and internally (where they are out of necessity a lot more cautious). Have the Snowden relevations really not managed to at least peg your evidence meter that maybe not all is as it should be? That your constitutional rights were trampled and that the protections afforded you appeared to be of no value whatsoever?<p>> If you really think that it&#x27;s possible that the government of a modern western nation could turn into communist East Germany, then it seems like your problem might be with governance, not privacy.<p>No, I think that we may be reaching a stage where influence can be wielded subtly enough that someone like you could convince themselves that there is none of it at all. And that&#x27;s the true prize, to wield that power but in such a way that it can be applied selectively enough that as long as the bread is on the table and the games keep going nobody will notice how rotten the core has become.<p>> If it&#x27;s possible for the government to go all Walter White and just turn evil over night, then no amount of personal privacy is going to save any of us.<p>It will never be that overt. It will be more along the lines of parallel construction and other nice little legal tricks such as selective enforcement. Never enough for you to cross that threshold.<p>> And until it seems like that&#x27;s a thing that&#x27;s actually possible, I&#x27;m going to make practical decisions about my own privacy.<p>You&#x27;re more than free to do that. Unfortunately, those of us living outside of your beautiful country don&#x27;t even get to have a vote in there. Your personal well-being trumps the rights of everybody that is not you, and like that we race ahead down the hole.",1452085287

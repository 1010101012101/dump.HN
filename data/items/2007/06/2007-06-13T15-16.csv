So he goes to your site and puts in Joe's email address. Joe goes to look at the resulting email he gets in his webmail, and bam, his password has been reset without his knowledge, because his web accelerator followed the link in the email.<p>The workflow should be like this:<p>1) as in your example<p>2) as in your example<p>3) User clicks on a link in that email and visits a GET page. The GET page has a form with a single button (""Really Reset My Password"" or something), or maybe it has a form right there for him to enter his new password.<p>4) He clicks the submit button, and the form submits right back to that same url, with the reset code embedded in the url, but this time it's a POST.<p>5) Your site's code detects it's a POST this time, and changes the password.<p>I was never suggesting you bypass the email verification step. Just add an extra screen between clicking the link in the email, and the password actually being reset.",1181749977

It would let us submit the more tricky ones.  It was invented because of the problem you're having;  it's ambiguous whether the trailing dot is part of the URL or not.",1181749344
27815,comment,27785,27804,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It comes from an e-mail sent to the address associated with the account, though.  The only way he can get the reset code is to have it e-mailed to him, so unless he's forwarded on the e-mail to someone else (why would you do this?), the reset is coming from him.<p>I wouldn't put up a GET page where anyone could reset anyone else's password - that would be silly.  (Though fun in a chaotic way...)<p>Edit: To clarify, the workflow goes like this:<p>1) Unauthenticated user visits forgot_password, enters in either username or e-mail address, submits a POST back to system with those parameters.<p>2) POST handler generates a unique reset code and embeds it into an e-mail that's send to the e-mail address associated with the account.<p>3) User clicks on a link in that e-mail and visits a GET page that resets the password to a random one and tells the user what it is.  Also logs the user in.<p>4) There is a link on that page that lets the user change it instantly, so they don't have to use the randomly-generated password permanently.<p>A simple POST to reset the password doesn't work, because a ""forgot password"" link necessarily requires that the user not be authenticated (otherwise, they haven't forgotten their password ;-)).  So you need the extra e-mail verification step so people can't change other people's passwords.",1181749237
27814,comment,27623,27623,0,0,lupin_sansei,,,"Here's a thought: In most Western countries health is supplied for ""free"" by the government (which deducts a premium from people's taxes). Such a person has no option to temporarily stop paying for health services, but an American can take that gamble. I wonder if this option amounts to another slight advantage that American startups can have over other Western countries? Namely the option to increase your wages slightly for a while in exchange for a reduced health service.",1181749063

What you call ""forcing yourself,"" I call every writers' room and recording artist contract.<p>I didn't write much good material until Valleywag made me write twelve blog posts a day.

If you add the police as a favorite artist, or a bands similar to them, they will grow in size. The Site is built to compliment your musical taste so the tagcloud is not completely based on overall popularity.<p>for instance the police are very large on my tag cloud.

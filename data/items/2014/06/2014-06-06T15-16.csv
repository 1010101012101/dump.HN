7858636,comment,7857889,7858224,1,0,icefox,,,"While TDD originally stood for writing tests first and then code for the majority of people TDD means you have tests.  I have encountered countless people that say they are using TDD, but writing tests after or during coding and not before.  To them test driven development means that you are done with a task when the test passes.  In comparison to before where there was no tests it is easy to see how the new way of developing is related to tests so they think they are doing TDD.  So I would say that &quot;classic&quot; TDD or test first development is dead.<p>It also didn&#x27;t help how TDD was shown in a study to not work out very well.  I don&#x27;t have it off hand, but it was talked about in the &quot;Making Software&quot; book  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596808321/wwwicefoxnet-20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596808321/wwwicefoxn...</a>",1402070209
7858635,comment,7857889,7857889,11,0,jamieb,,,"&quot;TDD creates bad architecture&quot;.<p>What is good architecture? I subscribe to the idea that we are doing software engineering and as such there are some &quot;generally&quot; understood principles such as SOLID, the Law of Demeter, Cyclomatic Complexity, etc that provide objective measures of &quot;good&quot; architecture (I apply SOLID all the way up the architecture hierarchy not just on classes).<p>What I&#x27;ve noticed is that TDD results in code that scores well against these measures, while code that scores well is easy to test (i.e. after writing the code).<p>Therefore, I think the argument that TDD creates bad architecture is false.<p>About 25 minutes into the talk we get to the crux of DHH&#x27;s complaint and it is that Hexagon is an alternative to the Active Record (which he created) and the only reason Hexagon exists is to allow TDD. Hexagon requires throwing away the really useful code that is Active Record.<p>Hexagon appears to be an attempt to introduce sound software engineering practices (SOLID etc) into the Ruby world (with what success I do not know). Active Record and Rails in general is really useful if what you want is what it does, but sometimes its not. The implied claim that Hexagon is a bad architecture is false. The claim that Hexagon only exists to facilitate TDD is false.<p>&quot;Mocks returning mocks returning mocks&quot;<p>I use mocks. Fowler and Beck said on the whole they don&#x27;t use them which genuinely surprised me. They cited examples of code where the test actually enforced implementation rather than purpose. I think that&#x27;s probably how I wrote tests for the first few years. Code that results in mocks returning mocks returning mocks is code that is violating the Law of Demeter. Its bad code. It happens to be really hard to test, and it happens to be <i>really</i> hard to write tests first that way. Universally I&#x27;ve only ever seen tests like that when the tests were written after the code. TDD doesn&#x27;t produce code like that because its easier to refactor it rather than keep digging that hole.<p>Mocks returning mocks returning mocks is a symptom of <i>not</i> doing TDD.<p>&quot;My mind works differently... I have to write code first&quot;<p>Spike. Problems that I don&#x27;t know how to solve I spike first (I write code with no tests, or with tests only as drivers of execution). That&#x27;s easy. The hard question is, &quot;Now I have all this code, I have to throw it away and TDD it?&quot; That&#x27;s pretty hard to stick to in a business environment. I choose to write tests-after for all those pieces of code that <i>already</i> meet SOLID metrics, and rewrite the code (using TDD) for the pieces that don&#x27;t. The pieces that don&#x27;t are very difficult to write tests for after, and they also happen to be the pieces where I find bugs (for example, I&#x27;ll cut and paste a bit of logic and find its wrong for one set of inputs).<p>&quot;All code should have full coverage of automated tests&quot;<p>All three agreed that this is the case. Fowler: &quot;If you have a full suite of tests I don&#x27;t care how you got it [TDD or not]&quot;. I don&#x27;t know about you but I&#x27;m still fighting this battle. I also have to deal with teams that have a &quot;full suite of tests&quot; and 80% test coverage, but where every single one of those tests simply executes code. No actual &quot;test&quot; occurs. Indeed, in particularly memorable test, I managed to delete 70% of the lines of code and all the tests passed (including deleting the one line that was the main purpose of the method). Approximately 90% of all the tests were complete garbage: they reported success as long as the code didn&#x27;t throw an exception.",1402070175

In a study by Johnson et al., widespread tau and beta-amyloid deposition was found in the brains of individuals who suffered a single traumatic brain injury. The study included the examination of postmortem brains from long-term survivors (1–47 years) of a single TBI () versus uninjured age-matched controls ().

I doubt that he intended to claim that mocking three levels deep is inherent to, or even common in, isolated testing. However, many others have proposed exactly that straw man argument. That argument misrepresents isolated testing to discredit it; it presents deep mocks, which are to be avoided in isolated testing, as being fundamental to it; it&#x27;s fallacious. It&#x27;s at the root of the claim that mocking inherently makes tests fragile and refactoring difficult. That&#x27;s very true of deep mocks, but not very true of mock-based isolation done well, and certainly isn&#x27;t true of isolation done without mocks.<p>> In a very real sense, isolated testing done test-first exposes design mistakes before they&#x27;re made. It translates coupling distributed throughout the module into mock setup centralized in the test, and it does that before the coupling is even written down. With practice, that preemptive design feedback becomes internalized in the programmer, granting some of the benefit even when not writing tests.",1402069335

Inhabiting one or more of those cultures, we might not be very aware of the others.<p>I read a bunch of people on Twitter and I was realizing just recently that almost all of them are people who are extremely suspicious of state power, extremely antiauthoritarian, and spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to learn more about electronic surveillance and thwart it.  These attitudes feel normal and familiar to me, but I don&#x27;t even have to look very far <i>on Twitter</i> to find people who are harshly criticizing them.<p>So one thing I&#x27;ve been thinking is that privacy advocates, rather than assuming that all programmers share our values, should be trying to figure out why some communities of programmers came to value privacy (and be skeptical of state power) so much, and whether there are paths to spreading those values in other communities.",1402069191

7858524,comment,7857150,7857739,5,0,bcantrill,,,"That this is the top comment restores my faith in humanity, because it is exactly what I came to say:  the adherence to 80 columns has nothing to do with refusal to accept change, and everything to do with enforcing readability.  If a function is so many scopes deep that 80 columns has become unruly -- or if function or variable names are so long that this is an unacceptable limitation -- that&#x27;s a reflection on the code, not on the 80 column limitation.  The code should be refactored, intermediate expressions assigned to local variables, etc. -- all of which greatly assist readability.<p>Additionally, and as others have observed as well, the author (mistakenly, in my opinion) assumes that 80 columns was imposed by the punchcard rather than the punchcard reflected an approximation of readable line length.  That this line length has an innate readability can be confirmed with this experiment:  take a book off of the bookshelf, open to a random page and input a random line of text in your fixed-width text editor.  Hardcover or paperback, small font or large, old book or new, you will find that the line is almost always less than 80 columns -- and often surprisingly close.  One can quibble about the exact number, but it is clear that there is an innate connection between line length and readability -- and that enforcing that line length is an easy way of enforcing minimum standards of readability.",1402069180

7858487,comment,7857638,7857848,4,0,dalke,,,"I don&#x27;t understand your comment. Nothing I said requires someone to &quot;study to be an actual scientist&quot; nor did I emphasize an orthodox style. How did you infer that? For that matter, how do you define &quot;actual scientist&quot; any different from &quot;average joe who makes a breakthrough discovery&quot;?<p>There is certainly a required style - a paper needs an abstract, it needs a body, and it needs a references section. This is because it fits into a larger system of use. People read the abstract to get a sense of if the paper is relevant to their interests. If so, then they might spend the money to get the rest of the paper, or spend the time needed to fully understand it. People use the references to get a better sense of the background required to understand the paper. Only people who fiercely believe they are exceptional (ie, not an average joe) might think they don&#x27;t need to include this information.<p>Another part of the orthodoxy is that it needs to be written in the language of the journal. Angewandte Chemie only accepts papers in German, so if you submit a paper in Malay then it&#x27;s not going to be accepted no matter how good it is. It also needs to be relevant to the interests of the journal - even if it&#x27;s in German, Angewandte Chemie won&#x27;t publish a paper about low-energy neutrino detection.<p>The &quot;instructions to the author&quot; describe these sorts of points. If that is too much orthodoxy for your hypothetical average joe, then joe will have a hard time doing anything, which makes joe decidedly not average.<p>On the other hand, editors will usually bend over backwards to get a seriously ground-breaking piece published. They just have to be able to understand that it&#x27;s 1) ground-breaking, 2) relevant, and 3) likely to be true. Joe&#x27;s first step is to convince the editor of that. If no editor can be convinced, then it&#x27;s unlikely that other, non-editors will be convinced.<p>You mentioned &quot;mis-formatting&quot; as a possible hang-up. To start, this means you haven&#x27;t read many papers, because I find mis-formattings all the time.<p>Remember, editors in nearly all cases are working joes who volunteer their time. As the UNSW link points out &quot;Even sending the [manuscript] back to you, unread, with a covering note saying &quot;Read the Instructions to authors&quot; takes time.&quot; - time that the editor would rather spend doing research. The problem is that editors get a lot of crank submissions and a lot of poorly done research. These are disproportionately poorly formatted. Editors are human, and if they see something that looks nothing like a scientific paper, it&#x27;s much more likely to trigger the &quot;crank&quot; flag than to be seen as a breakthrough paper.<p>There&#x27;s a balance at work here. A novelist who just wrote the next Great American Novel, but wrote it using a leaky ball-point pen on tissue paper, making the result difficult to decipher, will find it harder to publish. Xkcd #483 points out that the probability of new words created by the author is inversely proportionally to the probability of the book being good. And so on, and so on, and so on.<p>I think one of the points of confusion here is that &quot;ground-breaking&quot; is a very broad term, almost to the point of uselessness. <i>Every single published scientific paper</i> is supposed to break new ground. Some find a new sandbox, others a back yard, others an island, and a very few find a new continent. Without more information about your hypothetical case, it&#x27;s impossible if this is something like &quot;discovered antigravity&quot; or &quot;found a new intermediate of acetylene catalysis on the Platinum(100) surface&quot;, but odds are that it&#x27;s not something like the first, so the requirement for convincing people that it&#x27;s actually ground-breaking is higher.<p>For the record, scientists are average joes in just about every measure, except that they can put some extra letters before or after their name. Don&#x27;t get hung up by thinking they are special in any way. Also, editors have no clue on the background of a new author, and I&#x27;ve seen many papers where the author has no institutional affiliation, so it&#x27;s not like they can tell if someone is/isn&#x27;t a scientist. &quot;By your words are ye known&quot;, to misquote Matthew. To directly quote George Lundberg, editor of JAMA, after publishing a paper which included Emily Rosa, a 9 year old, as co-author: &quot;Age doesn&#x27;t matter.

Because, for better or worse, that&#x27;s all my compiler sees.  One compiler squawks when a line extends beyond Col 80, another allows the use of Col 81-90 for a markid, but the standard editor doesn&#x27;t grant access to those columns easily, so it&#x27;s infrequently used.  But if I&#x27;m using a more freely-formatted language, you can bet I&#x27;m ignoring the 80-column limit.  But I&#x27;m still keeping my lines as short as possible, and even wrapping in some cases, because my code needs to be easy to read, and side-scrolling is the antithesis of reading easiness.<p>Also, when I was coding in PascalVS at the University of Pangaea, I distinctly recall becoming incensed one day over the fact that, while the Hollerith card provided 80 columns, the PascalVS compiler stopped reading earlier than that--maybe it only accepted 72 characters per line.  That was irritating.  And costly--we had to provide our own cards, and on a student budget, they weren&#x27;t cheap!",1402068665

I don&#x27;t believe Node.js is that bad.<p>The 2 points I always hear from Node.js are:<p>1) Node.js is fast. It is really not that fast. It all depends on what you are comparing it to.<p>2) It is easy to learn. It is not easy to learn. The difference between browser javascript and V8 javascript are considerable. Not everybody will pick it up as easy as you imagine, specially if you are choosing Node.js to allow frontend devs work on backend code. It is a very different mindset.<p>I like the idea that is Node.js, but I don&#x27;t think it is mature enough to take over the backend. I think there are other more mature languages right now that do the job without making programs look like spaghetti code.<p>I think people should take this article with a grain of salt, and keep getting their hands dirty in Node.js.

This is against Mojang&#x27;s TOS, and Mojang has taken down several servers in the past for various TOS violations including this pay-to-win stuff.  During the recent twitter bout, a Mojang representative stated there was a distinction between a server accepting donation, and a server rewarding donations/selling ingame benefits.

The US is a bit different in this regard since it was always basically a trading nation and this what drove it forward: we don&#x27;t (usually) want your land or want to convert your people to whatever crazy idea we have, we just want to get (worst case) / buy (best case) your stuff.<p>That is an entirely different message and as long as it is not abused to much (see Iraq especially), it is a much better approach for the smaller guys.<p>Ideally I&#x27;d want all the countries to be open, democratic, tolerant, free market economies AND equal partners.

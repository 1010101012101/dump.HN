168717,comment,168635,168635,0,0,gcv,,,"I have a slightly skewed perspective, but I spent four years working at a Wall St. firm, and discovered that, while many people in finance have MBAs, the best frequently do not. The placement even worked that way: an analyst out of college gets a two-year contract in banking or trading, then the bank makes a decision. The chaff gets thrown away, the mid-range is sent to an MBA program and returns at the associate level, but the best stay on for a third year as analysts and then immediately become associates.<p>This doesn't address the question very well, I suppose, and obviously people outside of finance get MBAs. I feel that, at the end of the day, an MBA program is what you make of it. It can be a valuable networking opportunity. It can be two years off from working full-time. If you're thinking of going into it to learn about derivatives and accounting, then I suspect you're better off learning it on your own.",1208724741

168701,comment,168587,168683,0,0,vesterr,,,"Ha, with EC2 you can get around that now.  Separate your website IP from your crawling IP, and every time CL blocks an IP, switch to a new one.  Eventually they'll have to block the entire AWS range, but that's okay, you can crawl over cablemodem/DSL connections that use DHCP.  What are they going to do, block Verizon, Comcast and Time Warner?<p>Then you can get around referer [sic] blocks for your links to CL that the user clicks on by using a redirect, I think.<p>You can slurp the entirety of CL daily without causing them traffic problems.  I mean it's equivalent to each page getting one page view per day, which is nothing.

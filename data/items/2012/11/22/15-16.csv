Are you going to program in MIPS everyday? The same argument goes for JS. JS is <i></i>too little<i></i> in terms of functionality, so it requires lots of ceremony to write common idioms that other languages have had for decades. Javascript is a terrible language as it stands now, but its adoption and usage has matured enough that there's a lot less risk in pissing people off by adding syntactic sugar on idioms that people <i></i>already<i></i> use.

But to say there is no bandwagon or profit to be made in these niches is not realistic.<p>Everyone knows there is a hype, but that hype is based on reality. Big consumer data already has a value per GB.<p>Some say Big Data is just Business Intelligence over a large amount of data. I don't disagree and I see a solid future for BI.<p>Managers and consultants should prepare for the big data storm that is to come. Learn about the possibilities and impossibilities of cloud computing and Hadoop. I believe in a few years even tech-savy consumers (who now own an iPad) are able to use Big Data on their own data. Anyone can already rent a few Amazon resources to compute, and work with technology invented at Google a few years ago (MapReduce, BigTable). Or if you don't want to reinvent the wheel, go for Big Data as a Service, like Cloudera or Splunk.<p>In exchange for discounts, consumers will hand over their data to companies for free. Coordinates or purchasing behaviour: everything gets stored. Companies are busy exporting old data from tapes, so they can run completer aggregate queries.<p>When more big data analysts emerge, some companies will be ready: They'll have datawarehouses filled with data. If you do not invest in big data, you'll soon lose your competitive edge in regards to BI and consumer data.<p>The people that are extolling the virtues of big data are usually external consultants. They were the same that told companies to focus on mobile apps, and before that, to create a social presence. You can rail against that, but that is merely an epiphenomenon of every hype: Not what is really about.<p>All big tech companies are preparing for the future of big data (Amazon, Akamai, IBM, Microsoft).

4818967,comment,4812496,4813152,1,0,jellicle,,,"There's a lot of confusion in this thread.  The courts agree that accessing any internet computer in excess of any sort of actual access restriction is a crime.  There was a question - can this be stretched to fit violations of terms of use?  That is, a user unquestionably (in the case at hand) has 100% access to read and write on a particular forum, unless they post hate speech (private terms of use of the forum).  Now they post hate speech.  Does this TOU violation constitute a Federal crime?  And the courts seem to be coming down on the side of no, despite the language of the law that would seem to say yes.  It's just a little too much of a stretch for the courts to make any TOU violation into a Federal crime.<p>On the other hand, violating any sort of unambiguous access restriction is clearly illegal.  Suppose you start work at a new job.  The boss tells you not to read the files in the ""BOSS"" directory on the webserver, which is connected to the internet and not password protected.  You read them.  Have you committed a Federal misdemeanor?  Yes.  No court disagrees.  Many people have been convicted and sentenced to prison terms for extremely similar behavior (often involving employees who take files with them when they leave employment, or similar).",1353596860

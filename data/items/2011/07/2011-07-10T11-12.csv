When banks sold MBS and CDOs with AAA ratings claiming they were solid investments which they knew were not and in some cases they were shorting them, that was fraud. When rating agencies, governments, central banks and regulatory authorities helped them, that was conspiracy to defraud. When LEOs looked the other way that was conspiracy too. The whole system is rotten, there can be no reset without removing all these criminals from our societies, unfortunately historically this only happens when the victims of the crimes become angry enough to remove the criminals from power by force of arms or the system collapses in on itself like the USSR, neither of which is a good solution.",1310298887

This sounds dumb, because there's a big star-flash thing saying ""Look at the demo here"" - but I tend to ignore star-flash graphics as marketing fluff, and it appears to be the <i>only link</i> to the demo.<p>Then, when I got to the demo, it loaded slowly because the images on the page were large.  It was difficult to understand immediately just what I was seeing.  After a while, I managed to get a mindset that could interpret what I was seeing and I ended up loving the technical flair - but as a <i>customer</i>, not a Hacker News post-mortem fan, I think I would long since have been lost.<p>Probably, instead of a demo, a cartoon of some sort would have presented the idea better, like (1) snap a picture of your essay with your camera, (2) upload it with our easy interface, (3) see comments by our staff of starving PhDs, standing by.

Do I consider the MatLab matrix multiplication routine the library or the language?  Because the abstract syntax and semantics of MatLab could certainly do without it.  What about ODE solving?  I wouldn't use MatLab without it.  Is Lisp's (defun) library or language?  In my own pylisp, I put (def) in the standard library.  But you'll see little code that doesn't use it.<p>What about Haskell?  Is Prelude library or language?  Every Haskell file has it preloaded, so you can't code <i>without</i> it (without effort, anyway); but it can certainly be implemented in Haskell itself.  Is Haskell the language just typed lambda calculus with type classes and some basic syntax sugar?  Is IO Haskell language or library?<p>What about C's varargs?  Is it language or library?  It seems like library, since you include a header file to use it.  But it's also impossible to do variable-lenght argument lists in C without it.  What about longjmp?  What about sbrk?  It seems like library, since different OSs do it differently, and thus it has multiple implementations, in C.  But without it, you can't do heap allocated memory, which is something you can't do without it.<p>Separation between language and standard library?  What language <i>does</i> do it?",1310297310

We met, felt in love 
and ended up 01101101011000010110101101101001011011100110011100100000011011000110111101110110
01100101 , both for the first time together.<p>I was hardly mature at the time, couldn't envision a long distance relationship (didn't even had wheels at the time) and we stayed as friends.<p>A few months later she moved farther away for college, met some started dating and some time after, i started to think back and regret what i had lost and 
fought for her 2 years. It was teh first time of my life where i had set a goal, worked for it, fought for it and ended up succeeding.<p>We ended up dating for 1,5 years and 30k kilometers but after that, i started having depression and stress issues due to cronical psicological health problems with my father. Also i has decided to move out of my parents and be independent, which in my close culture was very difficult.
My parents were angry, my (ex)girfriend thought that i wanted to be free to have some wild parties in tha house and so on and i fell to the pressure of it all and ended up leaving her, twice, in 3 months. And i repressed all the feelings i had, due to not being able to deal with all the pressure and unhapiness.<p>After 6 months, she told me she was seeing someone else, i felt jealous and all the feelings surfaced again. Needless to say that, i ended up doing everything one should not do to try and get someone back, like pressuring, being possessive and so on, which only resulted in pushing her away to the other person. She ended up telling me that she didn't want me to disappoint her a third time, which is understandable, and i was ""closing a door to the future with her"", acting that way.<p>That was 7 years ago, and after trying to move along with my life with 2 persons and not being able to go over a line, since i still have feelings for that person, a lot of difficulties dealing with my feelings, unstable emocional and financial life, i'm at a point where i still believe i love her and want to fight for her love too.<p>As far as i know she is not currently in a relation but has told me very recently that she's interested in someone and doesn't think of me as more than a friend (erhm ""i believe we were never ment to be together"").<p>I recently broke up with my second girlfriend and i'm at a point where, as a freelancer, i don't even have money to buy food today, but in the last week i worked had to finish a gig, not thinking about paying the bills and etc, but with the intention of buying an engagement ring and sending it to her with a letter (she doesn't want to see me because ""i still have feeling for her""), explaining that i'm not really hoping that she'd say ""yes"" or decide to try and build a relationship as soon as she opens the box and sees it, but as a symbol of what she means to me and what i really wanted with her, to be as happy as possible, make her happy and share our lives together, hoping  that she feels something with that act, because like i said, i really believe that i love her and if i don't fight for her, i know i'll regret it all my life.<p>Am i crazy?

I will make an attempt to steer you in the right direction for your career after graduation:<p>1. Look at getting a minor in computer science. I'm not saying that you should do it, but you should at least consider it.<p>2. After you graduate, find a software development job in the field that you got your primary degree in. If a pharmaceuticals company needs a software engineer, they're going to have a much easier time working with one that speaks their language. This will basically get you work in your favorite field with the paycheck of a software engineer. :-D<p>I can assure you that there is a lot of custom software written for every large industry, and that includes medicine and pharmaceuticals. (Tomcat has FDA approval for use in medical applications. What does that tell you?)<p>The language that will probably be in highest demands for these applications is Java. Android development is a reasonable way to get your feet wet in Java, regardless of whether you manage to make money directly with it or not.<p>An even better option (in terms of what will be useful for a later career) would be to pick up servlet development and build web apps with Java.<p>Unfortunately for the short term, there are almost no shared hosting providers that support Java (you're probably going to need at least a dedicated virtual host). Also, App stores for web apps haven't really taken off, which makes it harder to make a quick buck off of them. Do take a look at Google's Chrome Web Store--that seems like the one most likely to get any real traction in the near future.<p>Good luck!",1310295629

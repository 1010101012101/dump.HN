Men with guns come and take bits of my life that I have traded for money away to fund this. If you're willing to go to that length, I'd appreciate some sort of metric whereby the NEA can tell whether or not they're <i>even getting anything</i> for their money, let alone whether it's <i>worth</i> it. I know it's really tempting to just deny any metric of worth can be applied to art, but if you nail art down to the point where only .01% of the population can appreciate it and we have to fund it because the plebians won't.... where's the public interest in this?<p>(Also, I'm not claiming the NEA has no such standards. Actually I quite believe it does, and in the end those standards are what people actually object to.

4194931,comment,4194500,4194500,3,0,shanemhansen,,,"I disagree with the general tone here. The fact is that relatively unsophisticated frameworks often perform better from a UX point of view because of this very reason.<p>I know I'm over-generalizing here, but most PHP apps can print a the website's headers and navigation and send those to the browser before it starts doing the heavy lifting. The reason? Basically because they are just a smart template, and the logic is in the view.<p>Java JSP's are actually the same. Very often you can see a jsp powered site print the website headers and CSS so that the browser can be rendering while the server is still working.<p>The problem with most MVC frameworks is that their interface looks like HTTPResponse process(HTTPRequest), which doesn't imply but pretty strongly suggests that the server isn't going to send any data back until the request is finished processing. Generators provide an API that theoretically gets around this limitation, but in reality would require massive amounts of coding in order to make all the iterators involved lazy.<p>So using some dumb, non mvc frameworks, it's easy to get a shorter time-to-first-byte. With a fancy MVC framework, it's pretty difficult and involves lots of lazy loading (to delay the processing associated with database requests).<p>So yes, MVC as implemented by most of the web, might be slowing down your site, and despite the relative sophistication of the HN crowd, it's not a problem that most front-end devs have on their radar.",1341334332

Writers for daily papers and blogs may run something they know isn't news to meet a quota (I've been in that situation), but the best way to pitch us is to give us something that's actually news.<p>My advice:<p>1) We're not all the same, no one can speak for all journalists.<p>2) Edward Bernays, a spin doctor so good he convinced the world that he invented PR, told Stewart Ewen that the job of PR is to instruct clients on how to ""just interrupt... the continuity of life in some way to bring about the [media] response"" (Ewen's book <i>PR: A Social History of Spin</i>) In other words, your job is making news. Easier said than done, but worth keeping in mind.<p>3) Read William Zinsser's book <i>On Writing Well</i> and apply it to all your communications. Specifically, write what you mean as simply as you can. Look at this for an example of what not to do: <a href=""http://boingboing.net/2012/02/06/edward-norton-and-daria-werbow.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boingboing.net/2012/02/06/edward-norton-and-daria-wer...</a><p>What does that Norton quote actually say? ""I liked working with these companies."" That's not revealing or funny or interesting. The vast majority of executive quotes I see in press releases are like this. All they really say is ""We think we have a good product."" <i>Yawn</i><p>4) Speaking of which, we hate quoting from press releases. Get someone important, like the CEO or CTO, to write a blog post that we can quote from.<p>5) I'm pretty technical for a journalist, but don't assume even the most technical of us are going to be able to decipher your string of buzzwords and jargon. Knowing what each word means individually doesn't mean we'll know what they mean when you use three or four of them together as a noun. Keep it simple.<p>6) Think about your subject line as a headline. Why would a reader read want to read your story? If a reader would want to read it, I as a journalist will want to read your e-mail. I get too many e-mails that just say ""News from [some company I've never heard of]"" or ""big data announcement, time to talk?"" I'd also throw a specific date into the subject line. Examples: ""New open source operating system launches Tuesday"" or ""Data Released Today Shows MindFuck is the Fastest Growing Programming Language on the Web.""<p>6) Even tech blogs want people stories. If you're stumped on how to pitch something in an interesting way, think about people. Things like ERP and tape backup are inherently boring. Find a fresh human angle. ""How a big customer avoiding disaster with our solution"" is a boring story. ""How Dr. Steve Made a Medical Breakthrough by Studying Archival Data"" or ""How an Average Jane Worker Catapulted Her Career with a Simple Manufacturing Process Tweak"" could be interesting stories.",1341333859

4194875,comment,4190247,4194402,2,0,rogerbinns,,,"I've basically rewritten almost all of it now.  One important note about our use case is that our product is a library that application developers add to their application.  This means we do not control the application and we have to play <i>very</i> nice.  Additionally any dependencies we include (such as an analytics library) reflect on us.  This is also why it is hard to get apps rereleased on changes in our code - users punish app updates that have no visible functional differences.<p>Here is a list of things that mattered:<p>* The library needs to have a posture on how it is used by multiple different components in the same app.  For example it can intend there to be one canonical source/package, or each component could make a private fork.<p>* If the canonical package is chosen then it must work with concurrent but different reporting ids and settings.  (For example Google screw this up by having the tracker be a singleton.)  It needs to be possible to find out the version number from tools so they can complain about being out of date.<p>* For the private fork posture it is easiest if the code is all one file (use nested classes).  It should use a sqlite database name that differs per fork so they don't clash with each other.<p>* The library will have ""slow"" work that needs to be done.  This includes updating the SQLite database with new events, clearing out too old events on startup, and sending event batches to the server.  I updated the mixpanel code so that it returns Runnables for that work, and then my library can use existing slow work threads.  Most however will want the library to work out where to run the slow work.<p>* I deleted the code that reads the unique device id (aka UDID).  Some companies are happy grabbing that - our privacy policy is far stronger.  We generate a random unique id string on first run.  Even the device code being present but unused is enough to set off binary analyzers.<p>* You'll want to grab some other stuff by default (eg carrier information, device model, os version)<p>* Make debugging easy.  For example the logcat mechanism on Android works nicely.  Mixpanel were just logging their API call, not any detail.  For example it would say ""track"" instead of ""track: clicked"" (where ""clicked"" is the event type)<p>* Sessions are what matters most.  Mixpanel has no concept of sessions.  For example when they purge unsent old events, they just delete the ones older than the time frame (was hard coded as 48 hours).  However this means it could end up deleting the first half of a session but transmitting the rest.  A better approach is to have a session id that is updated on each start, then delete all events belonging to old session ids.<p>In terms of implementation details, a comparison of Google Analytics to Mixpanel is useful.<p>Google only have one tracker instance, although you wouldn't know that from the API so multiple usage silently doesn't work.  They have an extremely complicated custom variable scheme for adding extra data for each event.  Ultimately their database stores a query string for each event.  If there are 10 to send then they make 10 separate GET requests.<p>Mixpanel supports multiple instances, but almost everything was hard coded (eg dispatch intervals, expiry of old data).  You supply events with arbitrary JSON data, including a list of ""super properties"" which are added to every event.  This is a very good approach.  The database stores the events.  When submitting, a POST request is generated with a batch of events (up to 50, again it was hard coded as two different numbers in two different places).<p>If you use query strings (in the sense of a GET) then there is a danger of the data being logged by proxy servers, hitting URI length issues, and being unable to batch.",1341333602

Any day could be the day that changed the world.""<p>I am still looking for an answer as to how the world could be changed by the discovery of the Higgs Boson particle.  What are some possible outcomes for society?  I do not doubt that it will change, and I agree fully with it's value, however, I can't find any specifics in what ways it might change or what new technologies might be created with or without the Higgs Boson.<p>Also, at a 9 Billion USD price tag, how were our governments convinced?  There must be something beyond scientific intellectual curiosity. Those of us with this curiosity may be happy to pay for it, but how were politicians convinced? What value will this provide to the governments of the world who made the decision to purchase this answer.<p>I'm sure it's not this...<p>Scientists: ""We need 9 Billion to find out if the Higgs Boson particle exists.""<p>Governments:  ""OK, here is your 9 Billion.""<p>... 15 years later<p>Scientists: ""The answer is yes.  The Higgs Boson does exist.""<p>Governments: ""Oh, that's really great.""<p><i>Update: I understand and agree fully with the value of this research. I am asking if there are any specific technologies that are expected to be advanced or if it is just added knowledge that could lead anywhere. I am also wondering how it was explained to politicians who don't have specific interest in science.</i>",1341331476

It was top-notch, but now its just a barren wasteland. And thats Microsoft. The company just isnt cool anymore.</i><p>Probably the best line from the article.<p>The point about stack ranking - good observation.  I've heard about it for years from MS people as well as mini-MS and such.  It struck me as problematic even back then.  In one way it's ""just another internal policy"", but it's pretty obvious it's going to create internal competition, which is the last thing a company needs.<p>I remember around 2000 or so - when the DOJ trial was going on - the stuff coming out of MS was ""we're the underdog - we see everyone as competition or potential competition"" (paraphrasing, obviously).  I don't know where that mindset went, but the last decade, they've not really acted like it.<p>Gosh, I'm not saying this well.  They <i>have</i> acted like it, but haven't chosen their battles well, perhaps.  Trying to compete in dozens and dozens of competitive landscapes at the same time has led to little focus.  Yes, ""Office and Windows"" are cash cows, but the respect (and fear) for MS is largely gone - they've squandered their image playing ""me too"" catchup in too many fields, and they've got a long way to go to be the leader in any field that they once were.<p>At least one tech generation, probably more, never experienced MS as the big leader to be feared - back in the mid 90's, any conceptual startup had to consider ""what if MS gets in to this market?"".  You had to be able to answer that question.  I doubt that's a question anyone has asked themselves in at least 10 years, if not more.  Replace MS with ""Google"" or ""Apple"" and that would instantly make sense to today's crop of startups.  But if you said MS, no one would even take you seriously.",1341331470

Your #1 employee should be someone who is almost as excited about the product as you. Furthermore, they should ideally have substantial skills and experience and complement you and the rest of the founders well. Most important: they should be a culture fit. Competitive salary and benefits shouldn't be cruical for the first employee. Vision and stock options should. Trying to save money by hiring someone less experienced or indifferent to your vision does not pay in the long run.<p>Ryan's advice is more about economics, but I feel that, since we're talking about hiring the first person, it should have been about vision and personality.",1341331351

Everyone seems to have forgotten that prices have been skyrocketing for the last two or three years.<p>As recently as six months ago, everyone was freaking out over the possibility of runaway <i>inflation</i>, and the government was cooking the official statistics by excluding such ""non-essentials"" as food and energy.  This is one of those times where moderate deflation is probably a healthy correction, and I hope the government doesn't try to stop it.",1227124708

Plus you can put up a job listing for 2 Exchange admins, and get folks who know how to configure/maintain the whole system.<p>Trying to build all those services yourself using open source options, tying them all into an LDAP server, is an amazing pain.  Does everyone need all of that?  No.  But honestly I can't imagine trying to handle the mail, shared mailboxes, messaging, scheduling, booking resources (conference rooms, equipment, etc..) for a Fortune 500 using the other options I'm aware of.<p>It may be ""blather"" to you, but it's generally pretty important stuff for a large company.",1227122795

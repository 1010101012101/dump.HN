9249885,comment,9247541,9249529,0,0,vetler,,,"> I think any software that has the potential to influence election outcomes should be provably correct (the whole stack), open source and probably have been out in the wild for years before getting used in a real election.<p>Let&#x27;s remember that even when paper ballots are used, the counting is done electronically. It&#x27;s not something people often take time to consider.<p>When the ballot boxes are emptied, the ballots are scanned with scanners, and the results put into some sort of software to be processed further. This is how it&#x27;s been done in Norway for many years, and we&#x27;re only 5 million people here, so I can&#x27;t imagine other countries doing it any differently.<p>Norway introduced a new voting system a few years ago, which also included Internet voting, but that has later been put on hold, as it was blocked by political reasons. The entire system was open source (you could read the code, but not allowed to use it), but I don&#x27;t think it has been released since then, and I&#x27;m not sure what the plans were. Fun fact, the settlement algorithm that ranks the candidates is a Postgres stored procedure (<a href=""http://goo.gl/PPMipF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/PPMipF</a>).<p>There is already a lot of places where there is software that can influence election outcomes, and it&#x27;s definitely not proved to be correct. Given how trojans have been found everywhere in the recent years, I&#x27;d not be surprised if some countries election software stack has been compromised.",1427097588

Then they exchange keys, and the random key generated by the controller is sent to the light, encrypted with the master key.  The light then stores the controller key. The controller and light must be physically close for this to work.[1]<p>Once you&#x27;ve done that, it&#x27;s difficult to reset a light to factory defaults. There&#x27;s a program called &quot;LampStealer&quot; which does this, but the controller and lamp have to be brought very close together, and even then it doesn&#x27;t always work.<p>Some devices can be reset by connecting to the Zigbee bridge with Telnet on port 30000, then typing various simple commands.

Unions, it seems, are flawed and can indeed at times, or indeed regularly, act in the interests of senior officials rather than those of their members.\nHello!\nThey are organizations. They are staffed by human beings. They are not going to be perfect. They will do dumb things. Some may be outright corrupt. This however is not the point.  The issue is not whether they live up to their ideals any more than whether any other organization does so. The point is whether their basic mission is such that they add value to the life of the average working stiff.\nOn this last point the evidence is fairly clear. For all their hideous imperfections, most people are better off with some kind of umbrella organization acting more or less in their interests.\nDo you really imagine that the &#x27;fat cats&#x27; think that their managers optimize their earnings as they would like? Do you think that they imagine that the members of congress they pay off do as good a job as they would like tweaking the laws to their liking? Of course not. They are pissed.

9249850,comment,9248328,9248849,0,0,skinnylatte,,,"I&#x27;m a Singaporean. I&#x27;ve worked in opposition politics. I&#x27;m going to be voting this year.<p>Here are a few thoughts:<p>- your understanding of the Lees in Singapore have no historical context. You cannot view his leadership in a vacuum. You cannot look at Singapore politics and say it needs a dash of &#x27;Western liberalism & democracy&#x27; and proclaim Chee Soon Juan one of its administrators. LKY, and the Singapore of his time, was a product of the times. There is no other place like it.<p>- No other place like it: that at the point of independence, we could have become &quot;either a Palestine or a Switzerland&quot;. He was prescient on that. Few other small states are sandwiched between two giants (India and China), few other small states are at the best spot of an important shipping route, and in that sense he — and Singapore — had a leg up<p>- The most successful opposition party in Singapore is the Worker&#x27;s Party, a party which is nearly as old as the ruling party. They are just as organized, if not more, and they are gaining momentum and strength. Like Lee&#x27;s party, they have no overwhelming &#x27;ideology&#x27;, it is about &#x27;what works for Singapore&#x27;. Voters like that. Voters don&#x27;t like SDP, and they don&#x27;t like Chee. Singapore voters don&#x27;t trust loose cannons, and I as someone who has been in the &#x27;opposition&#x27; most of my life would rather vote for the PAP if it presented a better candidate than the opposition, which is usually the case.<p>- Odds are stacked against the opposition, that is true; but the odds are lowered now, Lee Hsien Loong is not his father and the media is not nearly as powerful now. I would say that other than the Worker&#x27;s Party, every single opposition candidate and party is unelectable. God help us if they do. Personality cults and horrible politics. No ability to execute. Voters will not give them the benefit of the doubt; we do not see the &#x27;ability to govern&#x27; in them, and that counts more than &#x27;what party one is from&#x27;<p>- Throughout the land there is a profound sense of mourning. Even among the ones who have spent their lives on the fringes of Lee&#x27;s Singapore. He was a lion, and Singapore will not be the same without him.<p>- It will not descend into chaos, it will not swing the popular vote for the opposition. My read is that the PAP will still be in majority power for then next two elections.<p>- In the meantime, the work that has to be done is about how we ensure that we are ready for a post-PAP future. The reality of post-LKY is upon us today, and that changes things. Rapid destruction of our institutions isn&#x27;t the answer. The building of our capacity with our people, institutions and processes may be.<p>- In many ways, we are more ready than the world thinks for that future<p>- You&#x27;d think that well-educated well-travelled Singaporeans who have the world at their feet (can live and travel and work anywhere, pretty much) would immediately switch allegiances and vote in &#x27;democratic figureheads&#x27;. We will not.<p>- That doesn&#x27;t come from conservatism. It comes from a practical belief that these figureheads, like Chee, will be the end of Singapore as we know it — and that&#x27;s not from believing the propaganda of the state. It comes from knowing that the Singapore model works, but needs tweaking; and that the situation you have described above isn&#x27;t going to end well.<p>- After working on the ground for the opposition in the last elections, I believe Singapore voters are rational and no longer afraid.<p>- The odds are good, but the goods are odd. That&#x27;s the Singaporean opposition right now.",1427096627

Compactions will be rare and writes will be faster if C is bigger than 1. The read performance will be worse - we have to read more levels. To make compactions more often, we make C smaller. This way we prioritize read speed.<p>And the most important thing here that we can compact levels even for read transactions. If we have many read transactions, it is necessary to make then faster.<p>This very important point of LSM design is not mentioned in any literature I read.<p>Fractal trees can be seen as basically LSM trees with fixed coefficient C=1.

9249816,comment,9242217,9249009,0,0,bostik,,,"> <i>TCP does a woeful job</i><p>Not just TCP. Network operators are guilty too. There are the network side megalith buffers that are trying hard to &quot;optimise&quot; TCP transfers and just murder latency. Then, precisely because TCP is a stateful protocol and clients have the retransmission logic built in, the operators also have the option of applying something like RED at the earliest sign of network congestion. False positive or not.<p>(Note: I have a friend who works on the other side of the table and runs a team of engineers responsible for installing new mobile network equipment in the field. The use of mobile networks grows faster than the operators and their contractors can add capacity. Which means the situation is unlikely to improve soon.)<p>As you mentioned earlier, UDP at least has the distinction of being used in real-time and streaming protocols => operators and network gear are more reluctanct to mess with it. If you think you can get away with it, you could also assign multiple ports to any single session and apply at-least-once logic to the transmission - or to put it in layman&#x27;s terms: blast and spam the network, in order to get even a single datagram out without excess delay. Do that often enough and you can expect the operators to crack down on it, though...<p>As for work: thanks :-)",1427095825

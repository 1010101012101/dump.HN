2880958,comment,2878799,2878991,2,0,apinstein,,,"I don't disagree with the macro trend, however there will be some market for printed photos for at least a generation. For those of us that grew up with printed photos, we will always appreciate a printed photo a touch more than an electronic one, especially in small doses. This is doubly so for my parents, and grandparents. The digital generation may also appreciate it as a novelty.<p>So, even though the macro demand will continue to shrink, there is still a market for printed images. I would be curious to know from the founders if they have any real numbers as to the market size. That'd be the first question I'd ask them to see if there is any real play here. I would guess there are around 50m printed images still made every year in the US alone.<p>At a profit of 25c / image it might be possible to get revenues of several million dollars per year. Sure, it's no Twitter but it's a an easy business to build and test. With around $50k or so they can find out within 6-12 months if there is a path to significant returns.<p>That's a decent business risk IMO.",1313243875

2880951,comment,2880016,2880891,8,0,copper,,,"> C++ has too much stuff going on behind the scenes. (Like hidden object copies, potentially bloated operators, etc.).<p>The thing is, C++ is usually good about not charging you for features you don't use - and with the reasonably good debugging and profiling tools, most of the problems you mention above are fixable to get performance that is close (or equal) to C, with maybe better maintainability.<p>To pick a not-so-random example of something that's difficult to implement in C as safely as in C++, see expression templates[1]. I'd be interested in something similar to what eigen does written in C. (Of course, the last time I did this minibenchmark, so-and-so's lapack library was still slightly faster than eigen :)<p>The bottom-line, perhaps, is that if I'm writing a library, I'd do it in C simply because it's self-contained and has a nicely limited scope, and as a bonus is usable from oh-so-many other languages. If I'm writing an application that really, really requires serious performance, I'd prefer to use C++.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_templates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_templates</a>",1313243688

Most of the coverage AT&T is lacking and proposed to build out to expand from 8x% to 9x% coverage is in rural areas where T-Mobile's network is even weaker than AT&T's. In other words, there are very few places where T-Mobile has coverage and AT&T doesn't already; most of the new coverage they'd get in this deal is redundant.",1313243239

You pick where you feel comfortable on that line, I pick where I feel comfortable.<p>Looking at the commentary here and the last two similar things to hit HN, you must accept that regardless of where you or I might place ourselves, there are definitely people to the far right of the line. You can see people talking about this person as “the thief” without bothering with the inconvenience of a trail. You can see people discussing the publicity as a pubnishment. One comment talks about “naming and shaming” as a deterrant.<p>You may not consider yourself part of a lynch mob, but seriously, can you deny that such an element is present?",1313243077
2880942,comment,2880819,2880819,13,0,jonnathanson,,,"Here's an interesting tidbit:<p><i>""Moderator analyses revealed significant research design effects...""</i><p>What that means is that the design and sample selection of the studies influenced the outcomes of the studies to a large degree. Oftentimes, we see this happen in studies that draw from clusters of the population. Clusters are not truly random samplings. So when you take a sample population from a cluster -- be it geographic, ethnic, national, political, etc. -- you're run the risk of not taking a genuinely population-representative sample. Your sample population is likely to be more homogenous than a truly random sampling would be, as seen in a lower variance rate among respondents than you'd expect to find from a random sampling.<p>This is all well and good if what you're testing is the effect of X or Y <i>on that cluster</i>. But if you're trying to study effects of X or Y on the <i>general population</i>, then cluster sampling is far from ideal.<p>Let's say I'm designing a study called ""National Attitudes Toward Ohio State Football."" And for my sample population, I select 500 study participants from the state of Michigan. Would anyone in his right mind believe that my study will produce a nationally representative outcome? Similarly, if I'm doing a study called ""The Effect of Gas Prices on Grocery Budgets,"" I might be pre-biasing my outcome if I select from a cluster of long-commute suburbanites. Or from a cluster of poor people. Or a cluster of rich people. Etc.<p>It's hard to know what sort of design effects were noticed in the various studies aggregated into this particular meta analysis, or how the meta-analysis attempted to compensate for such effects. But the presence of that line in the abstract gives cause for concern.",1313242979

For example, tmux very quickly added support for handling Unicode characters beyond U+FFFF, a feat that (so far as I know) screen still can't manage. That's only one example, but I'm sure there'll be more as time goes on.<p>EDIT: One other thing that tmux does that makes it better than screen: when I start up a tmux session from within an X11 session, tmux clears the $DISPLAY variable so that processes running inside tmux don't try to connect to the original X server - which may very well have gone away at that point.

I had little idea what I should expect of the students, and certainly I didn't have any absolute standard of what constituted an ""A"", ""B"", and so on.<p>So what did I do? I just got the grade distribution from the last time it was taught and curved my class the same way. But this wasn't perfect... there would be a clump of five students who all got around the same numerical grade around a cutoff, and I'd round up rather than down. Similarly there were a couple of students who showed unusual effort and/or improvement, and I rounded them up if they were borderline. The end result was a grade distribution that was just slightly more generous than the last time. And hence I perpetuated the cycle.<p>As a professor, if you want to give strict grades, you have to be able to justify your reasoning when students complain. I don't terribly like grading, I don't have any deep insight on how to do it, and my department doesn't have strong opinions (other than that I should get back to writing my grants). So what do I do?

We do this all the time with videos on the news that show crimes in progress. Heck, we did it with the rioters. Local papers ran big pictures of them on the front page. Simply making public video and data that you have every right to have and use isn't the same as calling the guy a crook and demanding he be hanged.<p>Now yes, the mob will probably take over from there, but that's because the net is full of mobs, not because you've somehow made a mistake in publishing the data.

If entropy goes out to 3 bits per character, the one feeble point that you did have gets blown out of the water.  The fact that you don't seem to understand that indicates that you really need to go back and reread a few books on Information Theory.<p>Look, for your own edification, try and come up with a scheme that will reliably beat a dictionary attack in terms of the number of attempts needed before finding a password taken from the dictionary.  You could even write a simple program to test the idea.  Take a dictionary of 5000 words with a length of 6 characters or longer (much shorter words than what your theory suggests should be secure). Select 100 words from the dictionary at random, and then run any attack of your devising against those words. If you can reliably get a better average number of attempts than 2500, I'll concede the point.<p>Until then, I'm here to tell you that you don't understand information theory as well as you seem to think you do.",1313240596

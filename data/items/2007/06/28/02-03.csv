The important thing with all these cheap plans (I have one now around a $100/month) is to make sure they don't just cover generic. If you get really sick and need special drugs--which don't have generics--you're out of luck.<p>If you live in CA, I'd recommend talking to someone at allhealthplans.com. It's free (the insurer pays them), and they have great information about all the competing companies--no bs, excellent help. I've sent lots of people their way.",1182999310
31276,comment,31262,31266,0,0,dbosson,,,"I am very confident in both the idea and the design, but I am not stuck on either.  The idea has already completely changed once, and has slightly changed several more times.<p>I know a lot of people claim to have big ideas and it is tough to believe them because talk is cheap, but this is real! Something is going to happen and if anyone is serious about doing a startup I would love to get together to talk.  Even if we dont end up working together [passionate young people discussing Ideas, the future, and making life better] couldnt hurt.   \n",1182999277
31275,comment,31262,31263,0,0,willarson,,,"The pruning method of choice seems to be evaluating developers based on their contributions to open source projects. You have to be at fairly proficient to successfully submit code to a well run open source project, because bad patches usually won't be accepted (fairly... well... bad... usually... not a very strong sentence is it :p).<p>\nAFAIK, the YC route is similar but a bit broader: ask them for any kind of interesting projects they have built. You would need to have someone technical take a look at them (or you could probably post something here and you'd get half a dozen people's opinions on the quality of the work). <p>\nDepending on how difficult the idea is to implement (and I realize that this is hard for you to gauge), you may be able to go the Guy Kawasaki route of outsourcing the development. The general rule of thumb the community seems to have agreed upon is that as long as your chief product isn't technology (i.e. technology is not your core focus), then outsourcing at least the initial build is not untenable.<p>\nFeel free to shoot me an email if you want to discuss anything in private, I give you my solemn vow not to leak your project... anyway, I have too many other things to work on already :)",1182999117
31273,comment,31262,31267,0,0,tyohn,,,"I guess if it was me and I was in that situation I'd start at the book store reading a little about what other startup companies used as far as technology.  I'd read as many posts as I could on this site so I could gain insight into what is happening in the web 2.0 world from both a technology side and a business side. Then I could meet a developer and make a more informed judgment about what I was looking for in a co-founder.",1182998594

31271,comment,31262,31268,0,0,dbosson,,,"I don't know any developers and I agree with your opinion!  I thought about explaining my situation to Stanford CS professors and asking for recommendations.  I still might do this, but I wanted to get the opinions of the YC community first.",1182998245
31270,comment,31228,31261,0,0,tr02,,,"User driven in the sense the users are the editors. Slashdot is still interesting because the slashdot editors have maintained strict editorial control over the front page.<p>I agree the user-as-editors can work for niche subjects.  The programming subreddit is an example.",1182998041

31267,comment,31262,31265,0,0,dbosson,,,"It might not be that hard to find any old developer, but if he is getting ready to invest his life savings and is living out of his car because he wants it so bad  he is not going to want any old developer  he wants the right developer.  You got to get the right people on the bus before you start driving.  So how should he go about finding the right developer/co-founder? ",1182997068

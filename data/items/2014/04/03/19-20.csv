That conversation seems to me to be a part of the business itself.<p>He doesn&#x27;t have to believe certain things, but to be an effective CEO he has to have the community respect the integrity of his beliefs.  He didn&#x27;t even give them the opportunity to do so, and then complained that he was being witch hunted.  All he had to do was say &quot;No, actually I&#x27;m not a witch.&quot;  Instead he said &quot;I promise I wont speak any spells.&quot;  This analogy is getting a bit silly, but you get my point.<p>> Does a person have the right to be close-minded?<p>Absolutely, and a person has the right to be close minded and run a company as well!

7525913,comment,7523953,7523953,5,0,eridius,,,"How much of this could be done by building a new business that internally uses tarsnap? The business provides these service plans and completely abstracts the client away from the fact that it uses tarsnap under the hood. The primary risks I can see:<p>1. Colin gets hit by a bus and Tarsnap disappears. There&#x27;s not much that this new company could do to protect itself from this problem, short of convincing Colin to implement a failsafe that, upon his verified death, hands full control of Tarsnap (including any relevant private keys and passwords) over to someone who can continue the service (and that someone could easily be the founder of this new company).<p>2. Technical support that this company could provide would be limited based on the level of support that Colin would provide to this company. Again, perhaps this company could draw up an agreement with Colin for priority support, paying some large amount of money per month for the privilege.<p>3. There&#x27;s probably other issues I&#x27;m missing, perhaps this company can&#x27;t make the same guarantees tarsnap itself could (e.g. ability to be HIPAA-compliant) due to not being in control of the technical aspects.<p>But otherwise, it could certainly provide all the metered pricing guarantees, including guaranteeing backups don&#x27;t get deleted after a 7 day shot clock. And they may be able to make other guarantees (e.g. priority support) depending on what they can convince Colin to deal with; I&#x27;m sure that it&#x27;s easier to have a single special customer that gets special treatment than it is to offer priority support (and other guarantees) to arbitrary customers.<p>---<p>On another note, I disagree with the author that metered pricing should be removed entirely (although he seems to have already conceded that he will never win that argument). Tiered pricing for businesses is great, but there&#x27;s still a need for cheaper pricing for various reasons.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m an employee at a company that&#x27;s testing Tarsnap to ensure it meets the company&#x27;s needs before making the case for the company to buy a service plan. I may not have the authority to purchase a $50/mo plan, but I certainly would have no qualms about paying $1 out of my own pocket to test the service for two weeks.<p>Or maybe I&#x27;m an independent developer who&#x27;s bootstrapping a business. I&#x27;m still in development mode so I have no customers and therefore no income. Being able to pay $2/mo for the backups I need is a lot more appealing than paying $50/mo.

However, Rawls also insists, like Popper, that society has a reasonable right of self-preservation that supersedes the principle of tolerance: &quot;While an intolerant sect does not itself have title to complain of intolerance, its freedom should be restricted only when the tolerant sincerely and with reason believe that their own security and that of the institutions of liberty are in danger.&quot;",1396554635

(Look: you obviously think that having a backup plan for data is important; why do you not think that having a <i>business backup plan</i> is also important?)<p>You&#x27;re not serving your customers&#x27; needs if you can&#x27;t afford to ensure the integrity of your own infrastructure. No business lasts forever; what happens if Amazon, two years from now, starts making policy decisions that cripple your business? Steve Jobs died just over two years ago and most people agree by now that Apple has become a different company. Bezos is not immortal, and there&#x27;s a board of directors that would very much like to be making a lot more money from Amazon.<p>You&#x27;re not serving your customers&#x27; needs by maintaining an unnecessarily high barrier to doing business with you. I do web and mail hosting for a number of customers. Having backups is <i>really</i> important to me. But I&#x27;m also busy and underpaid and my hair&#x27;s always on fire and my bank account never has quite enough money in it, so tarsnap for me has never looked better than my current backup system (BackupPC on a machine I have physical access to in a secure location). Excel modeling to attempt to estimate my monthly costs for a service is <i>obnoxious</i>.<p>You&#x27;re not serving your customers&#x27; needs by being unable to fix problems that they are actively complaining about because you&#x27;re the only engineer in your business capable of addressing them.<p>Colin&#x27;s current way of doing business is actively interfering with his goals -- assuming those goals are anything more than, &quot;provide a cool backup service as a hobby&quot;.<p>You don&#x27;t have to become a disciple of SV startup culture. There&#x27;s a fantastically large middle-ground that allows for changing the business just a little bit without sacrificing its soul.<p>The amazing thing here is that both Colin and Patrick are amazing engineers: Colin as a software engineer, but Patrick as a business engineer. A business is an abstraction that can -- and <i>should</i> -- be engineered. That means understanding the scope and requirements of the problem being solved and then coming up with a system that meets them. Colin, for godssake, take Patrick&#x27;s advice just as seriously as somebody should take your advice on cryptography.",1396554585

I believe that is rather objective, and in these days pretty clear to assess with the plethora of people writing open source projects. Simply put, if I was recruiting, I would not have contacted if I didn&#x27;t believe you weren&#x27;t capable of the work. (I also have the same problem with &quot;Traditional&quot; interviews, inviting a person for a job then testing them with fizzbuzz is like hiring an athlete to join your sports team, and on the first day asking him if he can kick a ball.)<p>What really worries me - and why I&#x27;m more a fan of a trial period, is how do you, as a human being, fit inside our community. Other than &quot;not being able to do the work&quot; there are a million other reasons why someone would not enjoy, or atleast put up their place of work. Maybe the team always has 6 o clock beers, and you don&#x27;t drink so you feel left out. Maybe the team are composed of entirely of Montagues and you are a Capulet. There are human factors in the work place, and I believe, everyone should be comfortable where they work - and despite talks of equality, openness, and acceptance, there are people that just plain can&#x27;t get along with other people for whatever reason. Were human and we move on.<p>Now again, I&#x27;m trying to build a small startup team and it might be different in corporate.

I&#x27;d love to see an actual academic paper on what it would take to break the network.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that wealth inequality - specific groups of people owning significant amounts of money - will break the network&#x27;s assumptions.

Most reasonable people would be angry that they can&#x27;t access their money for that long. There&#x27;s a workaround of reserving a certain amount of coins so that it can&#x27;t be used for proof-of-stake, but that doesn&#x27;t actually solve the problem, and generally means that the poor will reserve all their money and never generate a proof-of-stake block.<p>And that leads on to another issue with proof-of-stake; the rich get richer, as a rule that&#x27;s explicitly built into the system.

I agree that brand needs to change some (and the product needs to change more) to be marketable to the enterprise, but... the boss basically respects his or her geeks... enough to pay them a lot of money.   Sometimes I even find the business folks emulating the geeks when dealing with computers.   A MBA where I worked saw how paranoid I was about ESD and asked for one of my wrist straps.

All at the same time starting with bypass kernel initialization. For obvious reasons, it is usually a bad idea to run other non-trivial processes on the same machine because they will tend to be resource starved.<p>Once you have these resources, you can organize them and use them as you see fit. Because it is not going to the kernel for any resources or buffering or scheduling or memory etc, there is little opportunity for the OS to do the wrong thing with resources that already are tightly controlled by the runtime.

They&#x27;re saying &quot;maybe no one else wants to buy/sell this stock but here I am and I always have a bid/ask on the table.&quot; You don&#x27;t have to trade with them. But a lot of people do every day.<p>Why do you think those people are trading with market makers if they&#x27;re doing such shady things?<p>I don&#x27;t think you really understand the business that market makers are in. They aren&#x27;t in the business of trying to front run people. They&#x27;re in the business of making a penny a share on all the trades that go back and forth. But they face a big risk. When they&#x27;re busy buying/selling for $50.00/$50.01 what happens when a big & smart hedge fund guy comes along who has new information and knows the price should really be $50.10. They try to buy up as many shares as possible at $50.00 and suddenly the market maker is fucked because they&#x27;re no longer market making in a stable market.<p>So the market maker has this big challenge where they have to do a good as job as possible detecting the big & smart hedge fund guy and quickly adjusting the price so they don&#x27;t get squashed. If they can&#x27;t do a very good job they have to increase spreads so they make more money in the steady state to make up for their bigger losses. If they do a really good job in this detecting they can lower spreads.<p>It turns out that HFTers are really good market makers. You can see this because they&#x27;ve successfully competed against each other to the point that they can lower spreads all the way to a penny (a 10x reduction of where they used to be!).<p>When you look at it this way you can see that market makers aren&#x27;t trying to screw the big traders, they&#x27;re trying to avoid getting screwed so that they can better serve everyone else by offering lower prices (lower spreads).<p>The nice side effect of all of this is that price information gets better communicated to the market faster. If you happen to be randomly selling your MSFT when Mr. Big & Smart shows up you&#x27;re more likely to get the best possible price due to all the information being correctly communicated to the market.",1396552331

7525269,comment,7524082,7524655,14,0,picomancer,,,"TLDR:  You can&#x27;t write the <i>first</i> compiler for a language in the language.  However, you can write the <i>second</i> compiler in the language and use the first compiler to compile it.<p>If you already have a compiler in the language you&#x27;re compiling, you can update the compiler with new features by the following process, called &quot;bootstrapping&quot;.  This process is used in gcc for example:<p>1. Use the old binary version to compile the new source version.<p>2. Use the binary produced in step 1 to compile the new source version.<p>3. Use the binary provided in step 2 to compile the new source version.<p>The results of stages 2 and 3 should be the same (assuming the old and new compilers assign the same semantics to the compiler source code and don&#x27;t have non-determinism, e.g. using wall-clock time to determine when to stop searching for optimizations).<p>The bootstrap process can&#x27;t be used on the <i>first</i> compiler for a brand-new language, because there is no &quot;old compiler&quot; that can be used in stage 1.  The only way around this is to write the first compiler in a different language that already exists.<p>Of course, if a self-hosted compiler is your goal, you can afford letting the very first compiler (the one written in another language) be limited, &quot;dirty,&quot; or &quot;hacky&quot;.  You don&#x27;t have to implement the entire language in the first compiler; the first compiler just has to support enough of the new language to allow you to write the second compiler.<p>Anyway, once you have the first compiler, you write the first version of the second compiler in whatever subset of the language the first compiler supports.  Once the first compiler builds the first version of the second compiler, the first compiler is no longer needed; you can add all new features to the second compiler only.<p>New versions of the second compiler (perhaps supporting more language features) can now be produced by bootstrapping.  Of course, you can also use the second compiler to compile a totally different compiler implementation written in the new language (this would be the third compiler for the new language).",1396552277

This now officially the standard play for formerly-dominating computer-platform firms who have fallen on hard times: having before been proudly hard-nosed and proprietary, publicly see the light and present a new image as a new, kinder, gentler company which totally gets it about openness. Former famous examples: IBM under Lou Gerstner (we love Linux and open platforms!), Apple after the NeXT acquisition but before the iPhone (look how expandable our new PowerMacs are; on the software side, we&#x27;re now an open-systems-loving Unix vendor, and we&#x27;ll even open-source our kernel!), poor old SGI (we love Linux now! Or, wait ... actually WinNT, whatever.). Sun of course used to go back and forth between being chill dudes who totally get it and more nakedly hard-nosed. As always in these cases, the questions are how far the bright new era of glasnost actually goes in substance (IBM legal&#x27;s patent monster quietly thrived through all the kinder-gentler period) and how long it lasts (these eras tend to end with the company either dwindling into irrelevance, or finding renewed success and going back to its bad old ways).",1396552207

Method-at-a-time JITs have been around much longer and represent a more traditional approach to JIT compilers.  Tracing JITs have only become popular in the last 5-10 years.  And during that time they&#x27;ve been seen as the sort of hot new thing, so much that there is a classic LtU thread from 2010 titled &quot;Have tracing JIT compilers won?&quot; (<a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3851"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3851</a>)<p>While it&#x27;s true that V8 has always been method-at-a-time and Mozilla has abandoned their tracing JIT TraceMonkey, LuaJIT is one of the fastest dynamic language implementations out there and is a tracing JIT.  Unfortunately the benchmark game dropped LuaJIT so it&#x27;s not easy to find benchmarks, but last I saw LuaJIT was pretty dominant speed-wise among dynamic language JIT implementations.<p>Mike Pall (LuaJIT author) argues that TraceMonkey&#x27;s lack of compelling performance was more a result of trying to bolt tracing onto an existing VM as opposed to any shortcoming of tracing as an approach (<a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3851#comment-57643"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3851#comment-57643</a>).",1396552176

If you really want to hire the best and brightest and you have to rely on an audition process then at least consider paying above average for the period of the audition and for the job (if you actually are getting the best and brightest, paying them above market should be expected anyway).<p>Alternately, look at other ways to hire. If you truly want a company filled with the best and brightest then I suggest you switch from a &quot;filter bulk submissions&quot; model to a talent scout model.

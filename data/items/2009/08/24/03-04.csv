It's about doing your job quickly and efficiently. My personal opinion is many jobs should not be structured as hourly full time positions but should instead be based off your actual value and efficiently. So if you can get the work done in 10 hours a week that should be it. You get paid 4x as much per hour. Many companies are starting to move towards independent contractors who are paid on a more realistic and honest scale and compete against each other on value & efficiency. I think it's a good thing. Of course it does not apply to all office jobs and probably not even the majority of jobs. It tends to be more common with engineers.",1251085838

781464,comment,781387,781387,0,0,gruseom,,,"I've been thinking about this again because of the recent re-post of one of pg's Lisp essays (one of the two that originally provoked me into learning Lisp). The essay makes an argument that the answer to your question is roughly ""No"". The argument goes like this: no language that lacks Lisp-style macros can be as powerful as Lisp. Macros aren't possible without code=data, and code=data comes from sexps. But any language that represents programs as sexps is a variant of Lisp. So the only language that can be as powerful as Lisp is another Lisp.<p>Now obviously we can argue about how to define ""powerful"", and the whole discussion can easily become another pointless language flamewar. But let's not do that. Let's provisionally grant the essay its definition of ""powerful"" and the corollary that Lisp macros are currently the apex of that power. The question is, is a more powerful (in this sense) language possible? (You don't have to agree with that definition of ""powerful"" to find the question interesting, by the way. Just rephrase it as, could another language beat Lisp at its own game?)<p>In my mind I've always referred to the above argument rather pompously (i.e. half-jokingly) as ""Graham's Thesis"" (because it reminds me of what used to be called Church's Thesis when I studied logic - it's a non-provable-because-non-formal assertion that expresses an intuition about something - in that case computability, in this case programming languages). We can state Graham's Thesis as: <i>Any programming language that's as powerful as Lisp is isomorphic to Lisp.</i><p>So, is this true? The critical thing is code=data. Is there a fundamentally non-Lispy way to represent code as data, that's as good or better for programming than sexps? (That qualifier is important, because there are definitely ways to represent code as data that make a lousy notation for programming, e.g. machine language.) If there is such a representation, then a language based on exposing it as notation could be as powerful as Lisp without being Lisp. But if there isn't, then variations of sexps are the only game in town, and those don't count as new languages. Replacing parentheses with different brackets, as was suggested here either trollingly or stupidly the other day, doesn't cut it.<p>As anyone who's seen a Lisp program and knows the first thing about a compiler knows, sexps are just the simplest notation for a syntax tree. That is, the thing that parsers turn programs in other languages into, Lisp programs just are. That makes sense, because parsers turn source code into data, and Lisp programs just <i>are</i> data. And any language in which you write programs as parse trees is Lisp (or will soon become Lisp as people add the obvious things you'd want in such a language).<p>So Graham's Thesis (man I feel silly writing that) reduces to the following: <i>the only representation of programs suitable as both a data structure and a notation for human programmers is the syntax tree</i>.<p>I'd really like to know if this is true. (Apologies to anyone who read my comment on this here the other day, as I'm repeating myself.) What languages are there whose source code gets turned into something that is fundamentally not a syntax tree? And what would the simplest explicit notation for that structure look like? I think this would be the area in which to look for an answer to the question.<p>There's one thing that makes me think such a representation might not exist: sexps are really just function composition, and function composition is how humans have done math for a long time. But if one does exist, I'd like to see it. There are a lot of people here with much wider backgrounds in programming languages than mine, so perhaps someone can just answer this.",1251085540

I've seen my dogs expend so much energy in a day that they can hardly walk and even appear to stumble or plop down on the floor without their usual grace. My parents' older dog will spend a day being hyper-excited (usually caused by the presence of my dogs.. :) and refuse to move by evening. Like, literally, she curls up in a ball and will not move for anything. Calling her name, getting excited for her to come, tugging on her collar, holding food in front of her... etc. When she gets that way, you just have to pick her up if you want her to move - because she won't (or can't) do it on her own.<p>Perhaps it's just dogs and humans. I've never seen my cat get that excited. :) My 8mo old, though, will wipe himself out if allowed to.

781448,comment,781129,781219,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Actually, this statement of PG’s about Darwin’s contemporaries is pretty oversimplified. Evolution-like ideas had been “in the air” for several decades when Darwin published, and at the time, many regarded them as heresy (by default), while others had bought into them. Natural selection was indeed a new idea, but while it strengthened the argument for evolution tremendously by providing a plausible mechanism, and while the giant pile of evidence in Darwin’s book was extremely important, the debates at the time weren’t all that different in tone from the ones that happen today (except that today all of the legitimate scientists are on one side these days).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_evolutionary_thought"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_evolutionary_thought</a><p>Lamark’s main works were from the turn of the 19th century, as was Cuvier’s work on extinction, and Darwin’s uncle Erasmus’s descriptions of “metamorphoses”.

The <i>Vestiges</i>, published anonymously in 1844, sparked massive controversy that was the talk of “educated” people throughout the world. Indeed, when Darwin finally published the Origin in 1859, the scientific/religious debate had been widespread for 50 years, and in the general public consciousness for at least a decade or two; Darwin himself had been well aware of it as a young man.",1251084587

781438,comment,781387,781387,0,0,iman,,,"There are languages that have useful features that lisp lacks. For example, Haskell has lazy evaluation and automatic compiler generated program correctness proofs (a decent type system).<p>Then there are languages that try to be even more powerful than Haskell, for example Epigram, which has dependent types.<p>Lazy evaluation is probably the language feature that is most mainstream that lisp lacks. For those not familiar with the abstraction benefits of lazy evaluation, consider a library for dealing with prime numbers. In a language without lazy evaluation, you are going to need an API with a function for getting the n_th prime number, a function for testing if a number is a prime number, a function for getting the smallest prime number larger than the number x, and a bunch of other functions.<p>In Haskell, the API only needs a single variable, called ""primes"" that is simply the infinite list of all the prime numbers:<p>primes :: [Integer]    -- primes is of type list of Integer<p>Thanks to lazy evaluation, this single variable is all that is needed to support all of the above operations in an efficient way. For example, to get the n_th prime number you simply write (primes !! n)<p>Now, this may look cool, but what does it have to do with abstraction? Since ""primes"" is a regular list, I can use it with any list function and build more complex things out of it. I can also have a list of all the catalan numbers in the same way, and all my functions that I've written that do cool things with the prime numbers can now be instantly used against catalan numbers.<p>You can manually do lazy evaluation in languages that don't natively have it, but unless you do it everywhere you won't get the abstraction benefits, and if you do do it everywhere then the compiler almost certainly will not be able to optimize it as well as a native implementation.",1251084010

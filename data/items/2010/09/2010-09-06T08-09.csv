I agree that applying some regular expressions to emails is not enough to make any other company buy you instead of building it themselves. But that holds for almost anything a startup can do.<p>Startups need to solve difficult problems or they are nothing more than marketing firms trying to create a hype around hot air. Filtering email intelligently, including automatic anonymization of sensitive parts within the email, can be a difficult problem to solve, and I think there are many types of email integration that a startup could tackle based on the approach Matt suggests.",1283763589

1666281,comment,1663986,1664652,0,0,nanairo,,,"But you have no idea if the rich will actually invest that money in the country, and if they'll do it now. Currently it looks like the answer to both of those questions is no.<p>As for government spending being inefficient, I know that's a common theme, but a lot of studies have shown that it isn't so clear cut. Sure, there are examples where that it is actually true. But most of the time people just use anecdotal experience and the conclusions are wrong.<p>In the UK, despite everyone complaining of the NHS (the national health service), it actually performs a great job.<p>As for if it's fair or not to take money away from the rich to give it to the poor, personally I think it is. Not because I want a communist society (far from it, I think communism has no basis in reality) but because of the old saying: ""It needs money to make money"". For example...<p>A rich family has already covered all their primary needs with their 20%, and with another 30% they cover the less important stuff. Since they have no use for the rest so far, they may either invest it or put it in a bank. Hopefully they'll get extra revenue from it which they can invest again, and so on.<p>The poor family, instead spends 100% just to pay for primary needs and a few non-essential goods. They are not left with anything to invest. If the want to get a new house or start a business they need to borrow money. That's basically saying that the poor get taxed for trying to get a house or start a business, so compare to those who are rich they need to earn more from that business for the net revenue to be positive.<p>But even if you don't think it's fair, it still helps the rich to give money to the poor, though only in the long run. A lot of poverty means more criminality. A lot of sick people means higher chances of contagious diseases. The rich gets a benefit from making sure that the poor are not too poor.<p>But anyway, these last two points are personal, and I understand if you don't agree. In either case I still think that giving money to the poor in an economy downturn is good to start up an economy where people are weary of investing.",1283763007

Here's an update as far as I can tell.<p>Credit-cards are very much existent <i>right now</i>, to the extent that I know people who got into nasty trouble with them. That's a thing of the last year or so.<p>Overall credit is a lot easier to get now, which makes the real estate market feel pretty bubbly, but there <i>does</i> seem to be a never-ending demand for new property. First reason is that in the cities you don't marry without an appartment. Second reason is that people are still moving in from the countryside & those that get lucky end up in a position to buy after a few years.<p>I thought Starbucks was 'out' and the Coffee Bean was 'in' last time I visited. Same story that happened with McDonalds a few years ago: a western brand gets popular just because it is 'new', then people realize that they are eating/drinking <i>crap</i> & come up with their own alternative.  Ever noticed how western fast-food joints sinicize (is that a word) their menus? That's not about concessions to the chinese tastes, it's about survival.<p>You're totally right on the copycat factor though & I actually think that's a great asset of chinese entrepreneurialism. It's a cut-throat world with lots of competition & they know how to stack the cards to their benefit. And why should they <i>not</i>? Unlike the western world they have a <i>massive</i> internal market to develop and cherry-picking 'the best from the west', then copying is a very valid strategy.<p>There's lots of cash to be made in luxury products I think. Just like the Japanese developed a taste for expensive watches 2 decades ago, I see the same happening in China. Over here in Switzerland jewellers / watchmakers are now openly catering to the asian market. I was in Luzern last weekend and just for fun started looking at the customers in the watch shops: almost all asian faces. And that makes sense, because most of my Chinese relatives will smuggle back a multiple of the allowed $10K worth of watches/jewellery every single time they visit europe.

</code></pre>
It's no big deal, but it's just one less thing to change if you need to change the type.  (I once had to go through some code changing longs to ints to make it run on a 64-bit machine.  Were the mallocs written this way it might have been a bit easier.)<p>And although I agree that his sizeof(char) rage is overblown, is the author's point about the zlib code not reasonable?",1283760362

71168,comment,71127,71161,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I'm a married guy, so I feel a little better about ""selling out"" and doing some consulting. I've also moved up the food chain from development into strategic technology management consulting, so when I say ""consulting"", it's probably a little different than when you say it.<p>
It all has to do with risk profile -- how much risk are you comfortable with? You always hear these stories about founders who made it work just running on credit cards and family loans until they took off. But what happens if you don't take off? You can only max out your cards and family loans every so often. So there's short-term risk like ""let's live on noodles and saltines for the next six months"" and then there's long-term risk like ""I'm going to go bankrupt, lose my house, and my wife is going to leave me"". If you're single without a lot of commitments, go for more risk and chase your dream. But remember that even if you get your dream, life is always about compromise. <p>
But if you decide to go to some kind of hourly-rate consulting for a while, take my advice and stretch your skills some. Instead of just Java Web apps, be a team lead for project, or an architect. I think as nerd we focus on the technical aspects of a project, but there are all kinds of good business lessons in there that can help you with your startup, if you go looking for them. YMMV",1193068247
71167,comment,70939,70939,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I hate to say it, but it's going to be a bit of a long, hard road.  Windows and Linux are very, very different animals.  And, if you're cominig from a no command line, GUI filled world, it's going to be a very steep learning curve for you.  <p>If you're not familiar with shell scripting, it will take some time, just to learn your way around the command line.  Then, you have to figure out how to install and configure Apache.  That's difficult.  Then, installing and configuring MySQL... Again, difficult and time consuming.  Then, you're talking about installing Perl/Python/PHP scripts and having them talk to the web server, that's an additional learning curve.<p>I'm thinking that a very knowledgable Windows geek who has set up IIS before, and understands web dev on a Windows box, but without any linux experience whatsoever is probably looking at a couple of months of dedicated learning to get all the technologies to work together well.  And then, security is an issue.<p>I mean, just learning how to edit a config file over the comand line using Emacs or Vi could take a week.  <p>If you're familiar with Windows, try using WAMP on Server 2003.  You can ususally get Windows 2003 hosting for a $10-20 premium over Linux hosting.  There will still be a learning curve, but it will be a lot shorter.  <p>That being said, any forray into Linux land is a good one.  It teaches you a lot of really good things about how computers and networks work that you just dont' understand from a Windows only world.  And, knowing *nix is a skill that won't be obsolete the next product cycle.  Unix is well worth learning, but it is probably not the best option if you want to launch your startup next week.

There were some projects where I could work from home, and I liked it, but they tended to be the smaller ones that yielded less money. <p>Edit: anyway, good advice, I will try it ;-)",1193068179
71165,comment,71127,71127,0,0,edw519,,,"The only way I have figured out how to do both is by dedicating each day to one or the other.  For now: Monday and Wednesday: consulting.  All day Tues, Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sunday: my startup.  I don't even bother trying to work on my startup on Monday or Wednesday night.  Any user requests from my clients are held until Monday and Wednesday.  I even have them trained to email me: no more interruptions.<p>This way I get the best of both worlds.  Try it.

It's definitely great for image search since it's very easy to glance at an image and know if it's what you're looking for.  I like it better than pagination for text search results but I think the issue is that it reduces ad revenue.",1193067917

71161,comment,71127,71158,0,0,Tichy,,,"I learned a lot through my consulting work, and I met interesting people and some new friends. It is just that it is taking up too much time. Even 3 months, which might be a kind of a minimum contract, is almost 1% of the productive time I might have left in my life, if I consider another 30 years in the workforce. I hope to be productive longer than that, but who knows. <p>I wish I could find more interesting contracts, but I am pretty much pigeonholed into Java Web Applications. <p>Today I finally received the ""Collective Intelligence"" book in the mail, it is so much fun (I always wanted to do things like that). Perhaps if I focus my projects on doing stuff like that, I could acquire different kinds of contracts. So far most of my own projects are also just ""normal"" web applications, because I try to make money. Mistake? I believe in the ""do what you love and you will be successful"" mantra, but in reality I still tend to make compromises with the projects I choose (because of the money scare). ",1193067104

During the first three weeks, I re-wrote the chat back-end.  Now I'm re-writing our search engine.  I've also done a bunch of work on our SEO.

We have <i>big</i> ambitions too - don't think all the interesting work will have been done already when you get here.<p>Almost every day I also get to be involved in a discussion whose outcome has a real impact on the future direction of the company, and people listen to me - it's awesome!",1193066743
71158,comment,71127,71127,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Consulting can be a rewarding experience. You have pointed out all the bad parts, and I agree. But where else can you see how so many businesses are run? Every company that is paying you to do technical work has already provided enough value to their users that they can afford to pay you. That means they must be doing something right. Learning how they provide value, how they decide to fund or de-fund IT projects, learning how it's easy to hack a small system but not so easy when you've got 12 thousand coders and a huge legacy base -- these are all lessons that you'll need to know if you want to start a business that is going to grow.<p>

71157,comment,71129,71138,0,0,jkush,,,"I agree. Python is a great language with fantastic support. I'm reading ANSI Common Lisp right now (it was a 30th b-day gift from mom, actually - does that officially qualify me as a  geek?). I don't know that I'll get to a point where I'm predominately hacking in Lisp, but the book is clearly written and too enjoyable not to read.

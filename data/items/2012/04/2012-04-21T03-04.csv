conclusions (opinions). This is good, but was still somewhat unclear.

responsible for implementing said decision.<p>Stuff To Improve:<p>1.) Reduce the volume on the ""click"" noise. It was a bit distracting at

possible conclusions. Let's say you're looking at the purchase of a
product to fill a specific need (problem statement), but you are only
willing to accept a choice limited to a short list of available
products? (or similarly, some of the possible choices are not allowed

3870830,comment,3858813,3863943,2,0,dkarl,,,"If you maintain a copy of the data and give them access to it, then you aren't going to lose the data.  You've lost control of it, since they can take it and do whatever they want with it, but you'll always have your copy.  However, very few web apps work that way.  The personal data that goes through Gmail is overwhelmingly generated in Gmail, and Google retains the only copy unless you back up all your data at home.  Ditto for Facebook -- the only personal data that people are likely to retain a copy of is photographs, and again, that would only be for backup purposes, except for hobbyists who keep raw files or higher-quality images at home.  For most people, Facebook serves as a very reliable repository for their personal snapshots.<p>We're completely at their mercy for all the data we create in their apps, and therefore we're completely dependent on two things:<p>1)  They want to retain customer trust.
2)  They are concerned that they might lose that trust if they misbehave.<p>They're constantly testing the limits of 2) (intentionally or unintentionally.)  At some point 1) could cease to be true.  They could become so necessary, or so powerful, that people become cynical about the possibility of defying them, and therefore start accepting abusive behavior.<p>Another scenario is that they could stop caring about customer trust not because they're too powerful but because customers have already abandoned them.  Imagine that in 2022 Facebook is a has-been.  It has been beaten in social networking, or social networking sounds ridiculously quaint in 2022, and Facebook is a failing company with no prospects for revival.  Kind of like SCO.  And it happens to possess, as its only asset, a little bit of intellectual ""property"" (a decade of personal information on a billion people.)  Perhaps, in its death throes, it will go the way of SCO, abandon all moral restraint, and attempt to squeeze a windfall out of that ""property"" in the most cynical way possible.  Maybe they'll charge you a ridiculous fee to retrieve your data in a useable form.  If their user agreements make that impossible, someone in the company might go rogue and sell all your private data to a shady entrepreneur in a lawless country.  They could sell the photos to Joe Francis and individual account histories to blackmailers and gossips.  We know that won't happen today, because Facebook has the resources and the motivation to make sure it doesn't happen, but if the company goes to hell, we won't have those assurances anymore.",1334980185

I have roughly 100-120k edits on the English Wikipedia ( <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Wikipedia%20resume"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Wikipedia%20resume</a> ), so I think I can speak from first-hand experience here.<p>The problem with devoting this much effort to Wikipedia is not that your time is wasted. If you get this far, you've absorbed enough that you know how to make edits that will last and how to defend your material, and this guy in particular is making edits in areas particularly academic and safe from deletionists; and your articles will receives hundreds or thousands of visits a month (see stats.grok.se, I was a little shocked at how many page hits my articles collectively represent a month).<p>The problem is that the benefits are going entirely to all your readers. It's practically a case-study in positive externalities. You don't even get intangibles like reputation. When you make 10,000 edits to your personal wiki, you will probably have written some pretty decent stuff, you will have established a personal brand, etc. Maybe it'll turn out great, maybe it'll turn out to be worth nothing. But when you make 10,000 edits to Wikipedia, you are guaranteed to get nothing.<p>(Yes, I realize his user page lists a bunch of media coverage. That's great, but it's only because he's the <i>first</i> to pass 1m edits.

I began writing things that didn't fit on Wikipedia and got a personal website because I didn't want to use some flaky free service, and the world didn't end. I now have an actual reputation among some people; on occasion, people even email me with job offers to write things (discussing a little ebook with O'Reilly, for example). I owe my current (very modest) job to my writings being clearly <i>mine</i>, and not 'stuff on Wikipedia'. I'm not saying any of this is very impressive, but I am saying that these are benefits I would <i>not</i> have received had I continued my editing on Wikipedia.<p>Wikipedia is wonderful, but it's sad to see people sacrificing so much of themselves for it.",1334979978

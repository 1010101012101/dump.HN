4104664,comment,4102248,4102859,1,0,hef19898,,,"I completely agree to the point that any IQ-test like test is just a proxy to meassure what is commonly called intelligence. And these tests are just proxies, they bear in themselves the risk that any studiy based on them is more analysing the proxy (in this case the IQ-test, SAT or whatever) than the real thing (in this case intelligence).<p>On the orther hand I completly agree that is damn hard to meassure intelligence correctly. But as as long as you don't have proxy that works as well for ""educated"" westerners as it does for ""uneducated"" bush or jungle tribesmen you still have quite a high risk of error in your studies. Just my 5 cents.<p>P.S.: Upvoted rstevensons posts, don't see any reason to down vote him for being critical about multiple choice tests as a basis for such studies.",1339570717

The cable companies should've known from the beginning what they are getting into as ""ISP's"". Offering an ISP service is quite different than a cable service.

The main difference between Google/Facebook and Microsoft at that point will be what business they are in. If the past and present are any indicator of the future (which I accept might not be the case), then Google and Facebook will be bringing in the vast majority of their revenue through selling ads. Microsoft, on the other hand, will probably still be making their big money selling software. Now I'm sure that a lot will argue that Microsoft makes $x off of android and $y off of linux, but this doesn't really make much of a difference to the engineers. In my opinion, what does make a difference, especially in the minds of ""young tech idealists"", is that Microsoft sells software, not ads (for the most part).",1339570170

He has a lot of very smart, very on point things to say -- however he is either gravely misinformed or pretty much delusional in his views of broader academia and its role in the proliferation of technology. You can see this tangibly from his founders fund investments in the bio sciences sector. Thiel views everything through the lens of incentives and grossly ""overfits"" this methodology to academic research arguing that the incentive to publish and be peer reviewed is responsible for the break down of truly ground breaking research. So instead he throws money at equally delusional (but somewhat qualified) PhDs in advanced fields for which he seems to have little grasp for. You see the same patterns in the people selected here -- ideas that sound ""cool"" as if from a sci-fi novel but tangibly very distant from real markets and profits.<p>I doubt his fund gets deal flow from serious silicon valley technology firms.",1339569694

As an app developer, you position things on retina devices no differently than on non-retina devices;  placing a button at (160, 240) puts it at the center of the screen in both cases.  The higher resolution / DPI is only used by the low-level font and graphics toolkit.

The review system is a competition between peers, and it creates an environment that is at times hostile and at times theatrical. Instead of focusing on technical/product successes people were concerned with ""visibility"" from their higher ups. Because of this competition for good visibility, office politics dominated the promotion process. People would take credit for other's work and position themselves to dodge accountability for mistakes.<p>In consequence, many (but not all) of the people who were promoted into management were people I didn't want to work for. The worst manager I had there avoided talking about anything technical and was strictly interested in deadlines and, of course, his own visibility. To indicate his disinterest to his direct reports whenever someone began to discuss an issue in technical detail he would fake a loud and obnoxious yawn. Other managers I interacted with were better, but people like that who would ""manage up"" seemed to keep getting promoted.<p>Disclaimer: I work at Google now.",1339568718

In any case, this is breaking what users have to do now - they have to purposely break the UI to get the results they need. They have to lie to the system to coerce out the answers they actually want, as opposed to the system being smart about it.<p>When I say ""leave at 11am"", I mean ""the closer to 11 the better"", not ""place a hard limit"".<p>Not to mention, Kayak's results display is <i>terrible</i> - the information is densely packed and not in an easily parseable way, making flight comparisons a gigantic chore. If I want to compare my departure times, it stuffs the return trip (which frankly, has no business being there) times right underneath.<p>It also insists on showing raw time values, without any visual indication of longer flights vs. shorter flights, nor visual indication that differentiates departure/landing times. This is only a couple notches above comparing UNIX timestamps. Manually, consciously subtracting time values is not something people are good at, and certainly humans perform poorly at it when forced to do it many times in short order.<p>It is, in short, needlessly precise. It doesn't matter if one flight leaves at 6:05am and the other leaves at 6:08am. I don't need that kind of precision in my decision-making process.

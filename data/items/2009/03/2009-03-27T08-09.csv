If I remember right, he had a single employee and was making ~1M CHF annual revenue at the time. He was so confident of his product that he listed his competitors on his own website - and he would mark each one that went out of business.",1238144298
534866,comment,533576,533816,0,0,davidbnewquist,,,"Your ""work/chore/business"",  ""fun/relaxing/pleasure"" dichotomy seems to be universal.  I can look at any task on my to-do list and instantly put it in one of those buckets.  Probably anyone with a to-do list can.<p>Why is this?! Assuming this ability is universal (and not just something chime and I are good at:), there must be an innate psychological reason.  Possibly even a ""simple"" reason.<p>I will venture a guess:  real or imagined self-threat is always associated with failure to complete a ""work"" task.  This is never true for an individual ""play"" task.<p>Thoughts?",1238144240

Currently this is what consuming most of my thinking about how should I proceed next on my venture. To further iterate on dev cycle or solve the money problem first. And since we are not funded, and now have gone private beta bootstrapping from our own pocket, I think the monetize-first approach seems to be the practical one.",1238143849

While Tesla is an eco-exotic/luxury maker, and in general luxury companies do luxury cars which by definition are not for mass usage.To name a few: koenigseeg, aston martin, bentley, or italians like  maserati or ferrari. It's hard to tell if they will ever build lower price car for mass usage lift off. Rather the way to go would be something that german Audi, BMW, Mercedes, or VW exhibit, a range of cars that have also a range of prices, but still in some sort they are considered to be almost luxury cars because of sustainable design in time, better quality (at least in most things inside or outside) and some additional level of innovation.",1238142850

Some of the major brands have educated children to their products from the very young age, and I don’t think I need to give you any examples of those brands.<p>They know very well that parents will have no choice but to comply with their wants and later the same children becoming parents will do exactly the same. Yeah! Very smart and we all fall for it.<p>Today the digital age is not any longer just driven from children looking at games or business people searching the next opportunity but from mums around the world.<p>Time poor, they are the prime consumers on the internet, as we know mums are “Jack of all trade”; taking the children to schools, buying and preparing food, going to work, looking after her hubby, clothe ironing, cleaning and … should I go any further to say that women these days are overly busy. So this brings me to what I have preached for fifteen years, the Internet not only save you money and save the trees but revolutionise your time management.",1238142183

A month later, the Secret Service was at my house.  As far as I know, the case was dropped, but for some short period of time I was facing federal charges and was under investigation.  I probably have an FBI file now (which I personally think is awesome).<p>So anyway, I would probably not click this link, unless I was using Tor or that new VPN service by the Pirate Bay guys.  If you are in the US, there is plenty of manpower around to waste your time.<p>(To be fair, the agents that were investigating my case didn't know much in the way of details.  As soon as I showed them the post in question, they became very friendly, and I haven't heard from them since.  But still, it was a big waste of my time and the taxpayers' money.)",1238141959

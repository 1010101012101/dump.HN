Want to remove the guesswork from how much equity to give employees? If so, you NEED to read this book!<p>I've been burned several times in my career with complicated equity situations. I have fiercely negotiated large starting equity positions with companies that never meaningfully found product market fit and are now out of business. I have had close founder friendships torn apart during an insignificant monetization event because both sides were dissatisfied with allocation of ownership that was incorrectly guessed many years earlier. I have also worked for late stage companies where the initial share allocation was decided many years ago, far away from the current growth business where all the risk and upside to the company's future now lies. These situations are complicated, stress-inducing, and frankly not fair for all involved parties -- Trust me, I was there.<p>I read an article that the author, Mike Moyer, wrote on BuiltInChicago.com that summarized the problem of slicing the equity pie problem, and his book's nutshell answer. Because of my history, the article resonated with me, and I downloaded the sample on my iPhone Kindle App. After reading the sample, my bell rang, and I not only had to read the Slicing Pie book, I had to read it TONIGHT!<p>I bought the full book and hunkered down on my mission to read it start to finish.",1350547093

4667843,comment,4666855,4666855,9,0,jread,,,"Ive been working on some similar analysis with EC2 and other providers. I think the big missing point in this post (acknowledged by the author) is with regards to EBS optimized instances and provisioned IOPS where weve observed a dramatic improvement in IO consistency. Another interesting observation I've experienced is that performance consistency often declines using multi-EBS volume raid, likely due to variations in spindle tenancy or network latency variations. EBS test volumes were 300GB. Better performance/consistency is possible using larger EBS volume sizes.<p>Here are links to a couple summaries of the analysis Ive done on EC2, Rackspace and HP. I plan on writing a blog post regarding this analysis soon.<p>Disk Performance:
The value columns is a percentage relative to a baremetal baseline 15k SAS drive, where 100% signifies comparable performance. Benchmarks included in this measurement are fio (4k random read/write/rw; 1m sequential read/write/rw), fio  Intel IOMeter pattern, CompileBench, Postmark, TioBench and AIO stress:<p><a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20765204/1012-disk-io-analysis/disk-performance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20765204/1012-disk-io-analysis/disk-...</a><p>Disk IO Consistency:
The value column is a percentage relative to the same baseline. A value less than 100 represents better IO consistency than the baseline. The value is calculated by running multiple tests on an instance, measuring the standard deviation of IOPS between tests, and comparing those standard deviations to the baseline. Testing was conducted over a period of a month on multiple instances in different AZs.<p><a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20765204/1012-disk-io-analysis/disk-consistency.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20765204/1012-disk-io-analysis/disk-...</a>",1350546914

4667839,comment,4667202,4667717,2,0,JohnsonB,,,">The point of that particular song and dance was that the ultimate cause of long term weight is net caloric balance. That's the one, simple, verifiable truth about nutrition that everybody agrees on. Everything else is a bunfight.
Any hypothesis which sincerely proposes that net caloric balance does not necessarily determine long term average weight must explain by what biological mechanism the conservation of matter and energy is being violated.<p>Consider this complete hypothetical, just to prove a point. Suppose that one individual's body functioned like this, due to a bizarre genetic mutation: Any excess calories this person ate under a high-carb diet would be turned into fat. Any excess calories eaten in a zero-carb diet would be turned into pure muscle mass, burned off in a raised metabolism, or are simply excreted.<p>Simply put, this shows that calories in/out can remain true, but only a fraction of what you need to consider to keep your weight under control, and this is essentially the assertion by Taubes et al., backed up by significant empirical evidence that these diets actually work, even if you disagree with the biochemistry of his arguments. In addition, there are issues like how hungry you feel (more likely to consume excess calories) under each diet, even after consuming enough calories to maintain a healthy body weight, and therefore how sustainable each diet is.<p>What you should care about when trying to lose weight is <i>how fat you get under a certain diet</i>, period. Not calories in/out, just everything.<p>So while you can say that ""in the end calories in/out is the ultimate rule that determines weight gain, everything else is an inaccurate generalization,"" you're missing everything else that could potentially interfere with your control of calories in/out. It's like saying ""The only thing that determines whether I can drive to my destination in my car or not is if I have enough fuel for the journey, so I don't need to concentrate on things like remembering to inflate the tires or inserting the keys into the ignition."" Excuse the left-field analogy, but I hope you see what I'm getting at.<p>The truth is that Taubes et al. never disagreed with and add enormousness value to the line ""Calories in/out"" by saying ""Yes but low carbs and eat a lot of fats!"". Again, as a rule for <i>most people</i>, or a helpful generalization.<p>>You have no idea what my macros are, you're just assuming. For me protein is the number one priority and I let the rest of the chips fall where they may.<p>Well I stated it as a contradiction just to hedge that your diet <i>wasn't</i> similar or overlapping with ketosis diets. If it is, one could argue the point that a lot of the success people have with non-keto diets is at least partially because they actually <i>are</i> following a ketosis diet, albeit inadvertently.<p>>Lots of people swear by keto. Swing past /r/keto and you'll find a success story every day. You can also swing past /r/paleo, /r/loseit and so on and so forth.<p>I agree that different individuals can have success under a variety of diets. My argument is that the default diet advice should be low carb, high fat, etc., rather than just low calorie.<p>Although I would say most paleo diets are actually a very strict keto diets themselves, and almost all are low-carb anyway.",1350546701

A criminal produces crimes. If we look more closely at the relation in which this branch of industry stands to society, not a few prejudices will drop.
It is not crimes alone that the criminal produces; he also produces criminal legislation, and, as a consequence, he is also the first mover in the production of the professors who produce lectures thereon, along with the inevitable text-books in which these professors cast their lectures as goods on the markets of the world. . . .
Furthermore, the criminal produces all the criminal and correctionary branches of societypolice, judges, hangmen, juries, etc., besides all the several branches of industry demanded by these, and all of which constitute just so many categories in the scale of social labor, develop different faculties of the human mind, create new wants and new means whereby to satisfy them. . . .
The criminal produces an impressiongood or bad, as the case may be. He thereby renders a service to the moral and aesthetic sentiments of the public. It is not only text-books on criminal legislation that the criminal produces; he produces not merely the penal law itself, and consequently the legislators of that law. He also produces art, literature, novels, even tragedies as shown by the appearance of Mullners Tanjte, Schillers Robbers, the Oedipus, and Richard III. The criminal breaks the monotony and humdrum security of bourgeois life, he thereby insures it against stagnation, and he arouses that excitement and restlessness without which even the spur of competition would be blunted.

I'll be wondering about it for a while...<p>The following is speculation.<p>On AliBarBar, you can find wholesale pans at source in china for $1 each. The price of pi like devices is about $30 dollars.<p>So, why do pans get so much more expensive as they cross the ocean?<p>1. Cost of postage<p>2. Protectionist import taxes. Here is Europeans list of things they are thinking of levvying punative taxes on. It's long. <a href=""http://trade.ec.europa.eu/tdi/notices.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trade.ec.europa.eu/tdi/notices.cfm</a><p>3. Regulatory approval. The burden of bringing a new electronic device to market is pretty high. You need specialist facilities (or to pay a lot of money to a test lab) to prove electrical emissions are fine. This is why so many Chinese designs never make it to the UK. Alibaba is full of lovely android powered arm net-tops, but you note the ones you see in electronic stores are from the same limited range, even the cheap ones. This is why.<p>I presume the same is true for pans. So although designing a pan and bringing it to manufacture is simpler than manufacturing a new ASIC or even embedded computer, only a very few pan designs can be sold in the UK. It just isn't worth bringing another one through approval (unless it's much cheaper). And the approved designs can sell for much more.<p>One hears about western companies keeping as much of the 'value add' as possible out of China and India, possibly because it's so expensive to retrieve money once it's in there.

The former also uses XML as a format, the latter JSON (in 2.0).<p>Like you say, Snap's main difference is it makes some more advanced CS concepts more overt, primarily for use as a teaching tool for older students. To this end, it doesn't have the deep social integration that Scratch does: remixing and sharing are a big part of Scratch.<p>But that isn't to say that Scratch isn't suitable for high school or college level courses - Harvard's been using Scratch in the first week of it's intro CS class for several years now, with great success. The advantage of Snap is that transitioning from it to pure coding can be less of a leap, due to support for things like recursion, procedures, and continuations.<p>The Lifelong Kindergarten's remit at MIT means that they tend to place emphasis on a certain age range.

Their staff economist, John Joseph-Horton, has some interesting papers about the justification for this. He argues it is actually in the interests of freelancers to have such a system in place.<p>Basically, freelancers prefer to be paid hourly (or daily, or whatever), rather than per-project, because clients love ratcheting and requesting endless tweaks otherwise. But clients prefer to pay per-project, so they can predict how much stuff will cost and not have to risk paying for freelancers that pad hours. ODesk's solution removes some of the risk for hourly billing, making it a more acceptable solution for clients, which works out for the benefit of freelancers.<p>A similar concept is how companies benefit from being able to be sued. Because you can sue them if they screw you around, you feel more comfortable dealing with them.",1368186018

And in that country health care costs twice what it does anywhere else in the world.<p>On another topic effective markets require good regulation.  For example in Australia phones work on all networks (government mandated GSM), and you can take your phone number between carriers (required by regulation) etc.  This created a more effective market.  One barrier to an effective market is complex pricing (deliberately introduced to avoid market forces).  Regulations to limit pricing complexity would improve the workings of the market.<p>Similarly in health care, requiring publicly available prices and quality reporting is what enables comparisons made, and make competition possible.  Economic entities don't want competitive markets, they want excess profits.<p>In summary markets are not an alternative to regulation.

""4-hour work week"" is impractical for most jobs. 40 hours is a reasonable average, but expecting anyone to put in an 8-10 hour contiguous block (that often ends up being ~11, including commute) is inhumane. Why, on the one 55-degree, sunny day in January that (by the weather's lack of concern for us) lands on a Tuesday, should people be stuck inside during that four hours of nice weather?<p>At least, if I were running a business, I'd plan on a 3-hour workday. First priority: get us to a point where we can survive on a 15-hour time commitment from each person. Project planning is based on that assumption. This puts slack in the schedule and reduces the slippage problem, because people working 9 hours per day in a ""crunch"" are pushing at 3x the planned rate, yet still working at a sustainable pace.<p>However, I'd only hire people who had enough interest in CS and software-- and, as importantly, whatever business I was in-- that they'd naturally fill to 40-60 (based on their ability) hours. I think people should leave <i>the office</i> before dark, but I'd want to hire the guy (or gal) who spends his/her stray hours thinking about and working on technology, even if I don't collect direct benefit. Think of it as ""65% Time"". You're not obligated for more than 15 hours per week, but you really don't fit if you aren't constantly looking to learn more.<p>I'd also have:<p>* an expectation that people eat lunch together. That's not to say you can't duck out to have lunch with a friend a few times per month, but your default behavior should be to eat with colleagues, not alone in a hurry. Definitely don't eat at your desk. (This may be my ""Ah, yes"" New England ancestry showing, but I really dislike eating at desks. To me, it's like eating in a car. You do it occasionally out of necessity, but you're supposed to feel bad about it.)<p>* 4:00 Tea, with snacks and board games. This isn't because I'm a nice guy, but because it gets people sharing ideas and encourages extra-hierarchical collaboration and mobility, and that makes both project quality and communication better. The somewhat devious thing here is that, after Tea's over (of course, it would never be called ""over"" because people are free to go) they'd have a lot of new ideas to try out and prove, so a lot of people would want to stay late anyway to experiment with the ideas they discussed over Tea.",1368185303

In these cases pypy doesn't do as well as when the JIT has warmed up.<p>The interpreter is slower than the CPython one.  For code which doesn't JIT well, it will go slower with pypy.  The firefox JS engine now has a fast interpreter, a quick JIT, and a more optimizing one.  This means the baseline performance is better in CPython, so if pypy manages to make their interpreter better baseline performance will get better.<p>The memory management in CPython is much more predictable and deterministic since it is using reference counting and not GC.  The pypy GC may be faster in many circumstances however.  IO in pypy can be slower sometimes if the GC is unhappy with the way you're doing it.  Especially if you're leaving files open, or reading in different sized chunks of data.<p>The new pypy release speeds up a few different types of real world code however.  XML processing, DB processing, and stackless async code (eventlet, and greenlet) are three areas where pypy has improved with this release.  Numpy based code is another area where pypy has gotten better with this release.<p>In short, pypy still has many areas where it could improve... but with each release is getting better at more types of real code :)<p>For run-once, and latency or memory sensitive code the benchmarks may be a bit misleading.",1368185074

Code isn't the only thing they do. They also have to meet with investors, manage people, set priorities, and network.

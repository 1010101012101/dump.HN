1849557,comment,1849274,1849383,0,0,_delirium,,,"As a user it's definitely somewhat disheartening. It seems like whenever something cool/useful comes from a small, previously unknown team, there's a significant chance that it'll just be bought and killed by a big player. Both makes me more wary of relying on such services to begin with (even if they're paid!), and from a progress-of-technology perspective feels unfortunate. I'm sure it's great for the founders, but it's like big companies are using their cash pile to do the opposite of encouraging technological progress: find technological progress elsewhere, buy it, and axe it.<p>Things do occasionally turn out okay, e.g. Google allowed the EtherPad team to open-source the code after Google bought/killed it.

So, I'm going to try to address what I see as the slippery slope subtext.<p>I don't think there's a slippery sloper from marijuana to cocaine, especially if marijuana is legalized.  The slippery slope argument is like arguing there's a slippery slope from beer to cocaine -- addictive personalities aren't that simple.  Further, any evidence implying a slippery slope from marijuana to harder drugs becomes less relevant after legalization, since marijuana users will then have fewer interactions with criminals and less exposure to harder drugs.",1288396619

I don't feel like it's hard at all. I'm pretty disciplined, so I guess that helps. Perhaps I also see the world differently. But overall we're happier, we spend more time with our kids than when we were in jobs, and life is great.<p>I would also point out that the 'family business' is nothing new. Sure it may be somewhat different when you're building a business to scale, but there are plenty of examples of family businesses where the parents work huge hours and are also raising kids. Heaps of examples come to mind where the parents are literally managing the store 6 or 7 days a week, and somehow looking after children as well.<p>If you see 'having a family' as a barrier then it will be a barrier.

It also leads users into a world surrounded by crime and illegality and makes it harder to deal with addiction.  On the other hand, legalization can make drugs more available and possibly enable more users.  Hard drugs like meth and herion are extremely addictive and damaging. Many people never recover once addicted and seldom lead normal lives.  Marijuana on the other hand does not share these traits to the same extreme.  I think the tradeoff for marijuana is clearly on the legalization side.  As for other hard drugs, the tradeoff is less clear whether society would be better off.",1288395908

It's no wonder there are hockey parent fight breakouts from time to time.

The extent of such smuggling will depend on a number of factors, including the response of the U.S. federal government. 5) If marijuana is smuggled from California to other states, it could undercut sales of Mexican marijuana in much of the U.S., cutting DTOs' marijuana export revenues by more than 65 percent and probably by 85 percent or more.

The first hijackers used guns, so the TSA (and other similar agencies around the world but I'll use the TSA as an example) made it hard to get guns on board. So the next round used knives.

With the damn near impossibility of getting knives on board <i>plus</i> the fact that passengers in a hijacking are now <i>much</i> more inclined to fight back, hijacking is pretty much fully defended against.<p>Bombings require bombs.

So they switched to shoe bombs. But now they're impossible. So they switched to underpants bombs. And with the latest (overly invasive) techniques that's more or less impossible too. The size of the largest bomb you can smuggle on board keeps decreasing, and the danger keeps getting smaller and smaller -- whatever you can stick up your butt it's never gonna blow a sizeable hole in the side of an airliner.<p>It's a finite space of threats, and they're actually doing a pretty good job at defending against them.

New hardware would be necessary for a Verizon iPhone (so it could work with CDMA), but if they were releasing new hardware, they'd likely have to fix the antenna issues.
If they did that, they'd then have two different hardware models on release cycles phase shifted by a few months from each other, and would have different hardware for different carriers--a sort of fragmentation that would massively complicate purchase of iPhones from Apple Stores.

I'll take myself for example, before I even knew what a startup was I was building parsers and what not. I needed money really bad so I started looking into consulting which then lead to startups, etc.. Entrepreneurs are internally driven because a lot of them have been through a lot of bad environments and want to create a better life and fuel the economy(which is related to the first point)",1288393573

So terrorists are either incredibly stupid or extremely rare. Either case suggests that we are spending way too much in both money and freedom defending against the alleged threat.",1288393570

I'd say about 30% of the people took the same option and received the same treatment. Same every time since I've that I've been through.<p>But the last time one guy made a big deal of how invasive the machine was (not rude, just loud about his refusal) and got the works (well, a rough pat down and then taken to one side). Obviously, this is a different case, he was just joking around with them. But I imagine this could easily have been a different story if one of the TSA officers couldn't handle a bit of humour (all too common, sadly).<p>Just saying.<p>These machines are a real problem for our privacy/society. But all the ""horror"" stories (not so much this one) we are seeing are mostly the result of people making a fuss, and getting rough treatment.<p>We should just refuse these, politely and quietly, and at such a volume all they can do is what they have done previously; give us a pat down.<p>Fortunately it looks like the UK air services are ""rebelling"" somewhat against ""draconian security measures"". It's not 100% certain what they are talking about, but I got the impression this covered resisting the spread of these machines in the UK.<p>Which makes a change :)",1288393545

It's not that an incompetent teacher is no barrier to learning (because learning is definitely enhanced by a good teacher), it's that students have choices in what and how they consume education.  If you don't like the way you are being taught, then find a better source for what you want to learn.<p>In particular, there are people who have taken your class before.  The teacher is the primary person who has ostensibly taken that class before, but when that fails, there are students who have taken that class before.  Find the few who got As, and ask for help.  Or if the book is awful, ask around for a better book.  Or hell, MIT's got their OpenCourseWare for more and more topics every year.  As students (really, we all are), it has never been easier to learn.",1288393521

The purpose of terrorism is to spread fear, the killing is only a byproduct. The reason hijackings and bombs on planes are so effective is that many people already fear planetrips. You're caught in a tin can that intuitively should drop to the ground instead of flying through the air ten kilometers above the ground with no way of getting out. The thought of a crazy guy with a bomb in his pants just waiting to detonate it makes the experience absolutely terrifying to a lot of people. They'll think about it every time the get on a plane even though the chance of dying in a terrorist attack is close to zero.",1288393409

Brad is a startup dad, from the navy/army. During service he was probably put under much more pressure and back then he was still a dad...so it really boils down to how well you handle the pressure coming at you.<p>Burnouts? Definitely.

Even if you have never done &#x27;networking,&#x27; realize you already have a network. Your classmates from high school and college, parents of your friends, friends of friends, people from your community, your neighbors, your professors, your professors friends, etc. They are all part of your network. See what they are all up to and see if they can recommend you to a job or introduce you to someone who can. Companies love to hire people that they already know. I&#x27;d love to see someone argue against this claim. \n2. If you exhausted your current network, then maybe you should build your network. Make a list of jobs/companies you&#x27;d want to work for, and instead of blindly applying to those jobs, try to meet up with someone who has the job you want, or works at the company you want to work at. It&#x27;s best to get an intro, but cold-calling also works (although you&#x27;re probably going to get a lot of no responses, you only need that one person who can help you get a job). Tell them that you want to know more about their job/company, and ask them if they could possibly spare some time to give advice. Offer to buy them coffee. You&#x27;d be surprised how many people are willing to help people who want advice. Once you have built a relationship, its much more likely they can recommend or refer you to a job.<p>Can you get a job by simply applying to a job? Of course, it happens all the time.

What people call low fat is really just not good enough.\nFor a seriously healthy low fat diet, read The Starch Solution by John McDougall. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Starch-Solution-Regain-Health/dp/1623360277"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Starch-Solution-Regain-Health/dp/1...</a><p>However, low fat or high carb still misses the point of focussing on macronutrients instead of micronutrients. Micronutrients are a good indicator of the quality of foods. Micronutrients: vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals, are important factors in satiety and long term weight loss maintenance. Whole foods like nuts, seeds and avocado&#x27;s aren&#x27;t low fat, but high fat, but can help in weight loss, because of their health benefits. Read Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman, who elaborates on this subject: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Live-Amazing-Nutrient-Rich-Sustained/dp/031612091X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Live-Amazing-Nutrient-Rich-Sustain...</a><p>I have experience in combining Eat to Live + The Starch Solution which got me from a BMI of 27 to 20 for three years already. I eat relatively high carb / low fat, with the moderate addition of some nuts, seeds and avocado&#x27;s. I find this works best for me. I&#x27;ve excluded almost all saturated fats AND free unsaturated fats like olive oil, which contain almost no valuable micronutrients.",1401607196

7828437,comment,7828027,7828027,16,0,zt,,,"I have been participating in a Stanford Medical research study since October. The name of the randomized control study is &quot;One Diet Does Not Fit All&quot; (<a href=""http://nutrition.stanford.edu/projects/DietbyGenotype-Study.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nutrition.stanford.edu/projects/DietbyGenotype-Study....</a>). The basic premise of the study is that as almost everyone has one of two insulin responses to glucose and that if you have one response, you should be on a low-fat diet, and if you have the other, you should be on low-carb.<p>My personal results have been quite successful. I was randomly assigned to the low-carb diet. I basically eat vegetables, meats, and cheese. I avoid everything from bread, to rice, to even nuts and fruits. On this diet I have lost nearly fifty pounds since I started. So it&#x27;s been pretty successful for me. (I will admit that I had no idea whether it&#x27;s the particular diet I&#x27;m on, per se, or the fact that I&#x27;m on any diet at all -- that I am paying attention).<p>I also accept the premise of the study: one diet does not fit everyone. Sometimes I meet people and they say it&#x27;s as simple as calories in, calories out. Some people say everyone should be on this diet or that diet. I don&#x27;t know -- I don&#x27;t presume that my diet would simply work for everyone. The human body is a very complex system both for any one person, and for the population. I tend to believe the central premise of the study (and we&#x27;ll see if it works out): that different physiologies lead to different beneficial diets (and perhaps much more).<p>There is a lot of story here: exercise being easier, meetings going more smoothly, my colleagues and family and friends supporting me, YC giving me a new t-shirt, buying a new wardrobe, my changing interactions with women (I&#x27;m strait, and who knows if this is due to me looking better or me being more confident)...etc...I&#x27;m planning to write up a (as is often the case) too-long blog post on it all when I&#x27;m finished with the study on October.",1401607070

This field needs validation, but it&#x27;s not primordial at the moment.<p>* Nice idea, thanks.<p>* On a phone, you can only select a date starting from today, so my Android doesn&#x27;t let me try it. It seems buggy on desktop browsers, I&#x27;ll check that out.<p>The two last ideas are awesome, but sadly the time won&#x27;t let me implement them.<p>Regarding the names suggestions, a cache for food names is implemented, I just need to connect it to the app.",1379606398

Because being a troll with no possible valid input to offer or being a good user is a binary state.<p>But of course if you look at the comments by most of those users, you&#x27;ll see a number of perfectly reasonable banned comments and maybe (if you can find it) the one infraction which may have started it all.

But they still work one week physically together every month, even though that means a bunch of 10-13 hour flights.

Another team I work with has made Tuesday the optional work-from-home day just to minimize the scheduling chaos and communication impairment that comes from people being out of the office.<p>I&#x27;m hoping that remote-presence tech will solve this problem eventually, but for now, there&#x27;s just no substitute for having everybody in the same room.",1379606274

I think the idea of LXC containers as software-distribution mechanism is a great one, and I credit Docker with getting that idea into my mind.<p>It is great to see that many of Docker&#x27;s ideas are being implemented upstream; e.g. LXC added support for BtrFS snapshots shortly after Docker launched.  Sounds like OpenShift is considering which Docker ideas belong in their platform.<p>It can sometimes be hard to work with upstream projects, who often have a different world-view.

But I mean terrible in the &quot;it not only doesn&#x27;t solve the problem, it actually makes it worse&quot; sense, not the &quot;it&#x27;s poorly written code&quot; sense.  I bet it&#x27;s a well-written (and tested!) piece of software, but I haven&#x27;t actually looked.<p>Cucumber tries to solve the problem of turning customer requirements into &#x27;real code&#x27;.  In exchange for that worthwhile benefit, it asks you to implement the most terrible, reg-ex based spaghetti code imaginable.<p>The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t solve the original problem AT ALL.  And then you are left with terrible reg-ex driven spaghetti code.  Like the Jamie Zawinski saying, &quot;now you have two problems&quot;.<p>The lesson here is that software development processes have to pass the &#x27;human nature&#x27; test.<p>The software industry has largely abandoned waterfall development because it just doesn&#x27;t work well in practice.  It doesn&#x27;t work because people don&#x27;t know perfectly what they want before they build it.  Agile processes usually are much more efficient because they are more closely aligned to how humans solve problems in the real world.<p>Cucumber suffers from the same issue of being disconnected with reality.  In theory, you can find a customer who can give you perfectly written use cases and you can cut-and-paste those into your cukes.  In practice, that never, ever works.

I do not use NoScript (I use Opera 12 and whitelist sites to allow JS or not via per site settings[1]). I also have Disqus added to my hosts file (but disabling JS will have the same effect). I would guess perhaps NoScript decides to partially allow some scripts and not others, making for chaos? That just seems like a mess waiting to happen that no developer can 100% predict. No JS or all JS is much easier, but half blocking is not so much when there&#x27;s dependencies.<p>However, I realize when sites fail (re-enable JS) and adjust accordingly as anyone that does such things should if they&#x27;re blocking content (though I&#x27;m used to adjusting since I&#x27;ve been using a browser with a minority user base for years). Alternatively, view it via Google cache search (and add strip=1 to the end to remove all images and JS) and run it through readability.

But cucumber has a critical flaw, it forces you to think about code while you&#x27;re writing. Because step definitions are global you can&#x27;t just write any old thing, you might fire off a step you wrote previously. This is only a side issue though, compared to the biggest problem, step reuse.<p><pre><code>    Given a person &quot;fred&quot; exists\n    And a person &quot;ethel&quot; exists\n    And a fatherhood exists with parent: person &quot;fred&quot;, child: person &quot;ethel&quot;\n</code></pre>\nDid someone mention cucumber steps are written in english? What happened to:<p><pre><code>    Given Ethel has a father called Fred\n</code></pre>\nI moved over to Spinach[1] about 18 months ago and I&#x27;ve been much happier. Steps are specific to a feature so I can go to town with shakespearean english. Reuse isn&#x27;t an issue either, it just happens in the step definitions, not in the gherkin files. Using more natural english tends to lead to fewer larger steps anyway, so it feels a lot less like call-by-regex.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/codegram/spinach"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/codegram/spinach</a>",1379605845

Someday they will also look for another job, run into some bad interviews, vent their frustrations on their blog, find another job, and forget about the whole episode until it is time for the next job hunt. Nothing good ever comes out of this though. The only way to improve the interview scene, IMHO, is to try make small improvements to the interviewing process at the firm you are employed at. With that in mind I have a question for the HN crowd.<p>I am employed at a startup in San Francisco which is in the middle of a hockey-stick growth. We are expanding in interesting directions and hence, we are hiring a lot. We now have a team of ~ 20 in-house recruiters to manage this. Overall, they do a good job, but I dislike one particular practice they have brought in.<p>When a candidate is in the office interviewing during the lunch hour, the firm buys lunch for them. But lately, lunch is brought into office and served over one of the interviews. Essentially, the candidate and the interviewer sits in a conference room, eat sandwiches and chat.<p>San Francisco, whatever its other ills might be, has plenty of great restaurants. Plus, more often than not, the weather outside is splendid. Thousands of tourists visit this city every year to sample both these aspects, among other other things. That being the situation, I will find it insulting to sit in a conference room, chew a sandwich and try to answer random technical questions. I would much prefer stepping out to eat at a restaurant, or at least pick up food from someplace to bring it back to office and eat.<p>Before I bring this up our recruitment team, I wanted to check if it is just me. I am told that many firms have adopted this practice. What do people here think about it?",1379605207

If you have product managers or BAs who can read code, then it&#x27;s easier to capture the requirements with more developer-friendly testing tools. And if the product managers or BAs do not read code, Cucumber doesn&#x27;t usually help much.<p>Having said that, I did work a gig where the tester would sit with the subject matter experts, and as they would talk, he would capture what they were saying as Cucumber tests, and he would then echo the tests back to them to see if they were right. Afterwards, he would then add whatever other tests he needed (checking weird edge cases and such), and code up any additional fixtures he needed. Then it was just a matter of me getting all the tests to pass. It was a really nice way to work - I knew unambiguously when I was done with something. (It helped that the tester sat right next to me.)",1379605047

Android is limited by its addressable market and that market is a lot smaller than the whole market.&quot;</i><p>That&#x27;s a clear, and clearly wrong, prediction. He lists a whole bunch of specific things that could go either way and predicts one consistent direction for all of them and they all came down the other way. That&#x27;s a comprehensive failure.<p>He calls Android dominance &quot;wishful thinking&quot; and links that phrase to another of his pieces in which he says this:<p><i>&quot;That simply means that no single platform can win a disproportionate share because it would threaten the balance of control the operators require. So talk of “dominance” of one platform or another is hyperbole. The most likely scenario is an even distribution of share between 4 or 5 competitors, so I expect iPhone and Android to get 20% share each.&quot;</i><p>So he was right about the iPhone (though they seem to have peaked), and wrong about the other 3/4 competitors in the market.",1379605046

6412212,comment,6411696,6411696,1,0,Zigurd,,,"As a consultant, I sometimes have to code or debug in all kinds of clients&#x27; office environments. Just saying &quot;open office&quot; is not enough to characterize an office. For example, at a design firm I saw project rooms where 4-10 people work that are usually buzzing with collaborative conversations, but they also have open &quot;hotelling&quot; space providing a quiet area. This is the opposite of the quiet-room or &quot;phone booth&quot; approach.<p>Their designers and engineers can also work at home part of each week. This combination seems to work well and their employees have a lot of say in how the workspace works.<p>The variation among open offices is greater than among conventional walled-off offices. In part I believe that&#x27;s because it is more difficult to make an open office work well for a mix of employees. It <i>can</i> work well for coders, but I think it&#x27;s safer to put coders in offices, and almost certainly not the same open space as business development<p>The most recent example I have seen of a failure in providing a good engineering environment went beyond the banal cubicle veal farm and included an insecure manager who needed to see all his engineers even though he wasn&#x27;t hands-on enough to evaluate their output closely. If you find clashing parts of your engineering environment the furniture is probably just one factor among many.<p>In China, crowded open office spaces are common, and use of headphones by coders is rare, at least in my unscientific sample space. After-lunch naps at one&#x27;s desk are normal, and are sometimes accommodated by turning down the lighting. I point that out mainly because napping in an open office in the US would be horrifying to most people. So keep an open mind about what can help.<p>I seldom have to deal with adverse workspaces for very long, and I&#x27;m aware that I&#x27;m paid to adapt to my clients&#x27; work-style. For Hubspot, making headphones acceptable &quot;work-wear&quot; is probably important to making all offices in the open for everyone work. I use IEMs if a workspace is very loud because some people might look askance at a consultant wearing big Sennheiser closed cans.",1379604708

However, even as a junior employee I also had an office, only because the building itself was relatively under-occupied.<p>Stints in the lab varied, sometimes I was in their part of the day and at other times we were in their for several weeks pretty much full-time.<p>In my experience in the tech industry I&#x27;ve worked occasionally in full time lab conditions too for a stretch of a few weeks. Generally I&#x27;ve found these periods enjoyable as well, but after a long stint in &quot;the lab&quot; I&#x27;ve been glad to go back to a more isolated environment.<p>Given this experience I find weaknesses in all the arguments about whether dedicated offices or cubes or open-planned work environment are the best. Personal offices are obviously the least worse, cubes are a ghastly compromise in my opinion, and open plan has obvious problems.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about ideal working environments, it would be one that allows focussed rather than forced collaboration. Labs allow for this but are rarely thought about because of the phyical constraints of most office spaces. *Oh, and it requires imagination and effort from management too.",1379604519

6412125,comment,6410682,6410682,3,0,robomartin,,,"This is one of the things that really bugs me about a lot of open source and Github code:  almost no comments.<p>It almost seems that there&#x27;s a generation of programmers being taught that comments are a waste of time.  I really don&#x27;t know where this trend comes from. Lazy?  I don&#x27;t want to believe that.<p>For my purposes it is a huge negative mark if a programmer is not religious about commenting code.  I will not hire someone like that.  Why?  Developing code is a huge financial investment, yes, but there are other metrics that are far more important than money.  If you are doing something non-trivial it often requires a lot of thought, discussion, testing, experimentation, failures, iterations and decisions.  Comments within code should be used to document some of this.  Document intent, thinking, problem solving approach, corner cases, decisions, where/how it could be improved, performance notes, etc.<p>This and the code become incredibly valuable.  It means that months or years later someone can go back into the code and truly understand what it does, why it does it that way, where it came from and, perhaps, how it could be improved.  You don&#x27;t need to engage in a research project in order to pick-up where the last programmers left of and continue moving forward.  In addition to that I firmly believe a well-commented code-base is far more valuable during an acquisition than a thousand files of code with hardly a comment.<p>I can think of a number of Github projects I&#x27;ve come across with nearly zero comments.  What you are looking at is dozens or hundreds of files vomited upon your hard drive that, yes, might perform a useful function at that point in time yet would be a nightmare to dive into to maintain them in any way.  Before someone jumps down my throat:  Just because something is FOSS it doesn&#x27;t mean we should  not critique such practices.  If everyone took the time to thoughtfully document their code the FOSS ecosystem would probably evolve at a faster rate.  Some of these packages are so dense they are virtually impenetrable without cubic hours of work deciphering the rats nest of files.",1379603867

In this one, the <i>only</i> people with an office were those that dealt with sensitive documents that had to be in a filing cabinet (in this case that was one person, the accountant, who did payroll).<p>I&#x27;ve also worked in an <i>open</i> office where the &quot;senior&quot; staff had offices with windows looking into the cubicle area.

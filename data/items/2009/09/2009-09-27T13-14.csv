In fact your entire comment was just that.<p>>Such limits are unknown until the given person puts many, many years of work into a particular goal (often at least five years.) That's because limits are not defined by where one starts, but where one plateaus for multiple years following some kind of improvement over the prior five, ten, fifteen years.<p>Genetics aren't some sort of magical limit that appear after pushing yourself hard at some pursuit for a decade.  They're another variable, along with training, diet, etc.  It's difficult to say what anybody's absolute limits are, but ball-park predictions are possible.  And no microcephalic is ever going to be an excellent chess player, regardless of training.<p>In your example of sprinting, the best in the world <i>was</i> noticed and brought into the sport due to his talents.  According to wikipedia, <i>""Upon his entry to William Knibb Memorial High School, Bolt continued to focus on other sports, but his cricket coach noticed Bolt's speed on the pitch and urged him to try track and field events.""</i>  And then, with less than a decade of serious training, he utterly demolished world records in three different events.  Two other points that suggest a large genetic component in his success are that he had only recently started training for the 100 when he broke the world record, and that he was the fastest kid in his school while growing up, even before doing an track and field training.<p>><i>For example: it's possible that somebody on Hacker News has the kind of muscle fibers that speed runners dream of. However, that person would never know they are athletically gifted because they never got to the point where this ability mattered;</i><p>Muscle fibers are only the least of what goes into running talent.  Paraplegics typically have a higher percentage of fast-twitch fibers than sprinters.  That noted, the premise that someone on a relatively small site such as this might unknowingly have the same level of natural sprinting abilities as a freak of nature like Bolt is ridiculous. Only if one believed that all hereditary dormant was ""dormant"" until one trained for decades and that the bobcat's leaping power sprang from its upbringing would that be a sensible hypothesis.<p>There's a mountain of scientific data demonstrating natural differences in abilities between different people.  In order to deny the existence of talent, you'd literally have to throw out the last fifty years of psychology, biology and related life sciences.  Sadly, quite a few people are willing to do just that!  The fact that there's an argument at all about nature and nurture both contributing greatly to life outcomes makes it clear that the influence of nature is severely <i>underestimated</i>.  That Gladwell and others who lack any background in life sciences are getting so much play in the media on this topic only serve as further evidence.

846808,comment,843512,844593,0,0,EliAndrewC,,,"> Maybe the first time you see it, for at most two minutes once in your entire life.<p>To the contrary, the main problem I've seen and experienced with Perl is that it's very hard to look up syntax.  If I had no idea what that code was doing, I would be hard-pressed to Google for ""@{$xs->[3]}"".  I've seen co-workers lose hours to debugging because they think that they find themselves in situations where an X is being evaluated in a Y context, or where they need to dereference a nested something but don't realize that this is what they need to do, etc.<p>I'm not saying that Perl is unusable because of these things.  I'm merely saying that these problems do not exist in other languages, by and large, with the possible exception of C++.  They don't run into these sorts of problems when they use Python, which people can just kind of pick up and start using without requiring a deep understanding of the language.  (I love ""Why I Dislike C++ for Large Projects"" for an example of why this is true for C++: <a href=""http://www.mistybeach.com/articles/WhyIDontLikeCPlusPlusForLargeProjects.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mistybeach.com/articles/WhyIDontLikeCPlusPlusForL...</a> )<p>I hope I don't come off as a Perl-hater.  Although I'm mostly a Pythonista, sometimes there's a Perl module in CPAN to do something that I can't find a library for in Python.  This community is probably Perl's greatest strength, which is argued quite eloquently in the OP.  Similarly, I often use C++ when I need to write something that runs really fast and/or needs to interface with a low-level library.  Both languages can definitely be useful even when other languages are available.<p>My criticism is simply that Perl (and C++) requires a much deeper understanding of the language to use effectively than most other languages.  I have co-workers who have used Perl as a scripting language for years, but who have very little understanding of what references or contexts even are.  This often bites them and they lose hours of time trying to figure out why they can't seem to pass a list of hashes to a function, or something.  (Similar things often happen with C++.)  And this doesn't happen with languages like Python, which make it much easier to write programs without deep knowledge of the language.",1254057144

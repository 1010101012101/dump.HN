3050643,comment,3050039,3050408,4,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Sure, he's very complimentary, in an <i>""imma let you finish, but the iPad is the best laptop replacement of ALL TIME!""</i> sort of way, which is to say rather derogatory at the same time. He tries to place the iPad and the Fire as distinctly different products serving distinctly different market segments: the iPad as the high-end ""laptop replacement"" the Kindle Fire as the low-end, low-cost, blue collar, half-assed substitute which lures users into buying it through content delivery rather than device or experience excellence.<p>That's not terribly complimentary when you boil it down. My take is that the Fire, keeping in mind this is a 1st gen product too, is a quite suitable iPad competitor head-to-head. It will provide a high-quality browsing experience similar or superior to the iPad and it will provide a high-quality e-book reading experience similar or superior to the iPad. The Fire's lack of dependence on any sort of syncing with a PC is also a point where the experience is outright superior. The biggest difference is the size and perhaps the hardware / performance / efficiency, personally I don't think there's an objective reason to pick one or the other as obviously superior in this category. Perhaps an 11"" screen is vastly preferred to a 7"" screen, perhaps both are suitable, perhaps the 7"" is more preferred, I don't know, and it's too soon to tell how well the Fire will stack up against the iPad performance wise. The other big difference is the app/game ecosystem. The iPad definitely has a head start and there are plenty of popular games and apps that are iOS only at the moment, but to be honest I don't think that network effect is big enough to drive the market a whole hell of a lot at the moment, especially in the face of a $300 premium on the iPad. The Fire doesn't have 3G, but it remains to be seen how important that is.<p>Overall, I think the Kindle Fire is a pretty strong competitor to the iPad, regardless of price. As I said, I think many people will find it to be a decent laptop replacement. Moreover, I think over the next year or so there are going to be a lot of moments where people who bought Kindle Fire's at or near launch will be having experiences that will make a lot of iPad 2 owners jealous.",1317257735

The ability to do server-push resources means that Amazon can fetch/preprocess/compress/cache the resources for a page, and then when that page is requested from another user and can be served from cache, they can dump all the required resources down the pipe automatically without the client having to fetch/parse/request/load/etc.<p>Amazon's 'everything goes through us' solution also optimizes in cases where SPDY normally wouldn't; external resources, such as jQuery served from Google's or Microsoft's AJAX cache, can be pushed to the client, whereas in a normal browsing situation you'd still need one connection to every server, so using multiple hostnames/servers would be detrimental to performance.",1317257586

Which is induction.  His claim boils down to stating that allowing proof by induction leads to contradictions.  But there is a pretty big tower of theorems needed to get there.  Most people's guess is that he has made a mistake.  If he hasn't, then it is still far more likely that some theorem in that tower is wrong than that induction leads to contradictions.<p>However if he proves to be right, in that tiny sliver, this will be really cool.<p>Now for the people who think I'm wrong, anyone want to wager  $200 on the outcome? :-)",1317257532

So if my song ranks #1 in ""jazz"", my ad is displayed in the sidebar.<p>Ads don't have to be a simple linked image either. They can be full-fledged javascript ads. Ads are sandboxed using AdSafe.

I am starting to think the industry is seriously broken in it's current form.<p>The main reason is that it is such a hit driven industry, which means that most companies live from hit to hit, until the moment they have a failure. At that point, most companies close down, as they can't afford a new production and may not be lucky enough to get a publisher deal early on.<p>The problem is that it is hit driven industry, and this is true no matter if you make AAA games like Gears of War or Halo, or if you make  small iphone games or middle-sized games on Steam or XBLA. The sales numbers drop sharply as you move away from the top selling games and it is extremely hard to stay in the top for very long.<p>Publishers are essentially the VCs of the games industry, and have enough money to spread their risk, as they know 80% of their projects will fail.<p>Another problem with game production, is that you don't really need that many people early on, when you are still figuring out what game you are making. Then slowly as you enter production, you ramp up the time. This is also the same reason, that so many people are often laid off after a game comes out. There is no longer a need for all those people in the company.<p>What I think really needs to happen, is for games companies to become more like movie production companies, where a team is assembled as needed and can be dispersed with no hard feelings after the production. The production of a game, also becomes a much more measured risk this way.",1317256107

3050558,comment,3047335,3047734,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Caches are kind of a touchy subject. I have no information that they are, but I would not be surprised if Google was inexorably moving toward a 'no user accessible cache' policy. The reasoning is pretty simple, people push things they don't mean too, then they 'fix' it, but if the GoogleBot was in the area your 'fix' may not be as durable as you hoped. Recent examples are iPhone 5 leaks on carrier sites, mis-priced sales at Walmart.com, and support sites at HP for products that were going to exist but now aren't.<p>Clearly its not Google's fault that people screw up and they happen to look at the wrong time, but a strict interpretation of Google's mission would suggest that keeping bad pages 'cached' isn't part of it. And while the vast majority of cached pages provide a great service like when HN exposure overloads a web site you can still see the content, Google cannot practically fix every cache page where the owner doesn't want it cached (they might not even know it is) and then fix it. (Yes you can email them to have them spike the cache but how many people realize that?)<p>A couple of the newspaper types went after them claiming the cache was an 'illegal copy' but of course the page didn't say 'no-cache' (which would keep it out of most CDN's as well so its painful).<p>So the cache feature is useful, but not everyone thinks its a good thing. If they have annoyed Google enough, Google may have just said 'screw it, lets get rid of this capability for end users.' But again, that is just speculation based on seeing it get harder and harder to 'discover' that Google has a cached copy somewhere.",1317255729

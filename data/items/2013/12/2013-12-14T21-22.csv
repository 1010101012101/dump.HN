I&#x27;m convinced that the rest were pretty much plied with drugs in the name of school grades, and there was no medical basis for their &quot;treatment&quot;. I&#x27;m sure there were many more than the ones I knew.<p>Years later, now that I am hopelessly dependent on my morning coffee, and can look back on past events equipped with a firm understanding of the nature of stimulants and their affects, from both a therapeutic <i>and</i> recreational perspective, I am all the more convinced that doctors are providing performance enhancing drugs as study aids, where no medical condition exists. Some weak-willed parents are simply swept up in the sales pitch and follow trends like mindless zombies, and other zealously ambitious parents don&#x27;t even think twice about subjecting their kids to unnecessary medicine if it means success and bragging rights at dinner parties. Still other parents know what the drugs do based on first hand experience, and feel no qualms about providing their kids with something they&#x27;d readily consume themselves.<p>The only thing that gnaws at me, is that in quiet suburban parlance, people will happily refer to prescribing their kids &quot;meds&quot; with jaunty, upbeat names conceived by marketing departments, but never <i>EVER</i> will anybody admit to what&#x27;s really going on.

If BP was not a legal person, they could not be sued after the Deepwater oil spill.  If the New York Times was not a legal person, they would have no free speach rights.  If Apple was not a legal person, it would not be illegal to take their cash reserves.

Weight gain is one.  It&#x27;s not just that the illness makes it hard to exercise and eat right, or that the meds are sedating.  There&#x27;s a weird mechanism on top of that which increases weight sometimes dramatically.  This has all the other problems of weight (social stigma, ill health, cost, etc etc.)<p>Anti psychotics are not just prescribed for people with a psychotic illness either.  Sometimes they&#x27;re used for people with personality disorder (often against best current practice guidance) or similar.<p>See the example of the anti-epileptic drug, given a tweak and re-released as a mood stabiliser.  This drug was later found to increase risk of PCOS.  Thus, a bunch of women given a med against BCP guidance (because it probably wasn&#x27;t that useful for them) had all the side effects of that med, and little benefit from it, and were then told that they were at higher risk of Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome.  You don&#x27;t have to hear too many stories from people on meds like that before you wonder just what this handful of drugs you&#x27;ve been given are.<p>In the past many people were sedated beyond the point of useful life, because we had asylums to keep these people warehoused for many years.

The modern world of Credit Cards and ATMs is 100% predicated on this work.  Amazon.com was in the realm of science fiction in the 1940s.  By the 1970s the conceptual basis for everything you needed to create it was in place.  It took until the 1990s for those concepts to mature sufficiently to let Amazon happen.</i><p>I can&#x27;t put my finger on why this seems wrong, and it could be such a strong contrarian view I need a moment to accept it.  I feel like the 1990s .com boom AND the modern social boom may depend on structured storage, but structured storage certainly isn&#x27;t the sufficient condition.<p>Reading through Hal&#x27;s prose, it struck me that HTTP is the very thing Hal set out to build, and it seems that since he was so focused on file systems he missed another obvious technology choice from which to draw.  Would it have been dog slow for every application to make local HTTP requests to read files?  Heck Yeah.  Is it insane?  Yeah.  Would it have been slower than what they built?  I don&#x27;t know...<p>And HTTP was so well understood and supported it would have allowed applications to start to mix content from local and remote sources, what we effectively have with pure JavaScript apps today.

Currently, most OS&#x27;s have at least three different ways to &quot;view&quot; the same folder (list/icons/details).<p>If your data is on a USB-stick, it&#x27;s even worse, every device will show you its particular &quot;interpretation&quot; of your filesystem structure. This was less of a problem with the smaller 512MB sticks that might contain just a few files, but nowadays 32GB sticks are not uncommon, holding a user&#x27;s entire documents library (or a copy thereof).<p>Contrast with a physical file system, nobody is going to impose their &quot;view&quot; or &quot;interpretation&quot; of your personal (physical) files. In fact, it&#x27;s considered bad manners to reorder someone&#x27;s bookshelves without permission ;)<p>That&#x27;s (part of) the reason why you can find files so easily in physical systems, because <i>every time</i> you interact with it, your memory of where particular items are located is reinforced, because there is just one representation of that system, regardless of context.

6907105,comment,6900625,6907041,1,0,mpermar,,,"> The infographic is based on actual numbers we have of leading mattress company&#x27;s products so there is nothing false about those numbers.<p>Well, those numbers are quite distant from what I know from working with several factories, not in the US but I cannot imagine the difference to be very high in production costs. There is quite a vast difference from the cost of making a cheap mattress and an expensive one. We buy mattresses from factories that might cost us $100 and others that cost us $800. Between them there is tons of other models. Put there the factory margin which these days is much much lower than it used to be and gives you a factory cost.<p>So your numbers, I don&#x27;t doubt they are real, but they are quite a generalization. And well, I haven&#x27;t searched online but can you point me to a similar product i.e. futon/mat for $3000 on any website? I&#x27;m curious about it.<p>As per the gimmick.... well, mattresses have been called mattresses for a long time and have been thicker than 5&quot; for a very long time. And so have been futons. I am afraid I can&#x27;t really buy your the marketing gimmick argument.",1387054974

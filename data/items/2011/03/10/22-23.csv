We could provide a lowerbound defined as:<p><pre><code>  def thread_low(t): return resident_set(t) - shared_set(t)\n\n  lowerbound = sum(map(thread_low, all_threads)) + min(map(shared_set, all_threads))\n</code></pre>\n(Forgive the Python notation, it would actually be easier to express this using actual summations if I could draw freehand, but given that I can't, I figure code would be clearer.)<p>For all threads in the process, we know that it must be solely responsible for its resident set minus its shared set. This already is a lower bound, but it ignores what is shared. We can increase (improve) this lowerbound a bit by figuring out what the smallest shared set among all of the threads is. If my thinking is correct, then we can be sure the total memory used won't be lower than this.",1299797832

There are several ways to get it:<p>1. Face a new client problem and think long and hard how to solve it.<p>2. Ask colleagues who have experienced similar problems before for general guidelines - ""frameworks"" or ""best practices"" in consultant-speak.<p>3. Share some proprietary knowledge in a disguised form, e.g. percent ranges instead of absolute numbers, or get client's data and tell them where they are versus the industry[1].<p>4. Directly share proprietary knowledge.<p>(Have I missed anything?)<p>In my experience: (1) is usually ~80% of work, (2) is ~19%, (3) is ~1% - happens very rarely and only with explicit client's consent, and (4) is strictly prohibited - people may violate it, as people my violate any law, but any management consulting firm is very strict about such violations.<p>To me, (1) has no moral problem whatsoever, and (2) is probably not very different from how <i>any</i> professional is getting experience - in McKinsey/other consultant's cases the speed of sharing the new codified knowledge is obviously much higher than in other industries, but that's part of their business.<p>My personal opinion - grey area in consulting industry is certainly not darker than in many other professions. Author of the article probably underestimates percentages for (1) and (2) above.<p>[1] Example: there are databases that management consulting companies keep on e.g. operational performance indicators. You can get access to some aggregate statistics from that databases in exchange for providing your own data. The individual data points are never shared.",1299797389

2311048,comment,2309324,2309324,0,0,amadiver,,,"I expect to burn some karma for this, but there's another extant pocket of optimization driven development: banner ads. If there is such a thing as a ""good"" banner ad, I'm referring to those (unobtrusive, non-autoexpanding, subtle animations resulting from interaction [no seizure-inducing manic blinking]). Good banner ads use almost no bandwidth (15k-40k) and go easy on the user's processor. They are built for big companies who care about their reputation and trafficked by platforms that respect the user.<p>I don't get to build as many of them as I once did, but they're incredibly fun little puzzles to solve. Cramming largish photographs, animation, copy (including fonts, which usually result in the bulk of filesize), and animation into such a tiny package is no small feat, and requires a lot of time (the productivity tradeoff Jacques referred to) and tons of little optimization tricks you need to spend a few years collecting and perfecting, like:<p>* becoming a vector artist. Sometimes its necessary to have a partially transparent image, which means 32 bit PNGs, which are super expensive. Flash allows you to create vector masks (vector illustrations are incredibly size efficient), which means you can use a PNG-8 or JPG and mask out the areas that need to be transparent. Which means getting really good, and fast, at tracing outlines. The next level being<p>* learning how to do photo-realistic illustrations. In the old days of 12k for a banner, I did a lot of car banners, which meant a lot of car illustrations that needed to look exactly like the photos. Even then, you'd have to reuse your assets a lot, in creative ways, in order to make the filesize. (Like using a tire illustration for the windshield [by scaling and masking]).<p>* writing really tight code. In the early days, our basic animation engines were a few KB, but you could rewrite your own using only the chunks of code you needed, and save a few K. My newest library is about 800 bytes and is powerful enough to use on most of my banners.<p>* learning that people really aren't as detail oriented as you might think, and blurs, rotations, tints, and speed are usually all the tools you need to make a convincing animation",1299795257

That you believe the leader in the market place is fighting a losing battle of trying to algorithmically determine relevance in a world where humans will actively work to subvert the algorithms. That the world would be a better place if a more customizable search experience existed.<p>A common response is ""Well if this is such an important idea they would already be doing it.""<p>So as an entrepreneur you deal with the naysayers and you build something which other people have ""... been clamoring for a blacklist for years"" and yet has never materialized. And you put it out into the market.<p>Right up until you deliver your product, nobody knows who is 'right' in this back and forth. It is all academic. You've built the best product you know how to build, you offer it up to the world, and when you ship the debate stops being academic and starts becoming empirical.<p>When the market leader adds features that mimic ones you've launched with several months ago, it can be simply timing (they may have been going to do it all along and it just happens that they did it now), it can be a response, it can be random I suppose. Regardless of why they did it, it seems to be an unequivocal damnation of pure algorithmic search.<p>As one of Blekko's founding concepts was that the search experience can be made better by human curation, I choose to interpret it as validation. Not that I expect Google to join in and adopt the ""web search bill of rights"" anytime soon of course.",1299794714

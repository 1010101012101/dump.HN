A better description would be, we cannot power all transistors at the same time because there is a power limit with regards to how much power a chip can consume.<p>Just because you may only be able to power x% of your chip, doesn&#x27;t mean x% of your chip is useless. Some times you need to turn off parts of the chips anyways. Examples include cache misses or particular hardware flows. Other times you can decrease frequency due to program characteristics. For everything else we throttle because we cant power all the transistors at all times.",1382767125

If you&#x27;re a scientist your approach is the first.<p>It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to come up with a philosophically sound logically consistant explanation for natural phenomenon which isn&#x27;t unified and connected at a fundamental level.  Two incompatible sets of natural explanations are vastly less likely than one unless we&#x27;re falling back on superstition again.<p>Hence on some level there will be a unified way of approaching and talking about physical phenomena.  Now, is that underlying consistent theory achievable?  Well that&#x27;s a different question.  If the unified explanation for all natural things, at its heart, relies on physics we just don&#x27;t have access to - either it&#x27;s too small scale for us to ever probe, or too large scale, or no longer manifested at this point in the universe&#x27;s life (there are examples of this I could describe but that&#x27;d make this post too long) - then of course we would not ever get to a satisfactory scientific account which is unified.<p>But efforts to get there tend to reveal other interesting things so are worthwhile even if we never achieve the final goal.<p>Plus because it&#x27;s so specialized and inaccessible to the layman, the degree to which there&#x27;s already tremendous consistency and unification in our theories of the underlying nature of things is dramatically underappreciated by most people.",1382766363

6616481,comment,6615660,6616359,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"The California law strikes me as unreasonable. It&#x27;s an example of the law being expedient rather than just: The person who should be responsible is the person who perpetrated the &quot;negligent or wrongful act or omission in the operation of the motor vehicle.&quot; But if that person has had to borrow a car then perhaps they don&#x27;t have any money, so plaintiffs want to take it out of the pocket of someone who we know has at least enough money to buy a car notwithstanding their apparent lack of any wrongdoing. The just outcome when the owner lends a vehicle to someone who is not known to be irresponsible is for the driver to be liable and, if the driver may not have enough money to pay the damages and we want the injured party to be made whole, the government should establish a requirement to carry sufficient insurance.<p>> In general, the owners of things are liable for damages caused by those things.<p>In general the owners have to have been at least negligent to be liable. And the cases to the contrary are similarly contemptible instances of injustice where the lawmakers see sympathetic plaintiffs and nearby deep pockets from which to filch coins and for political reasons (in the case of legislatures) or because they are restricted to deciding a single case (in the case of judges) are more inclined to impose liability in innocent bystanders than set out a requirement for parties to insure against losses incurred through the acts of culpable but insolvent third parties.<p>> The question of liability is not irrelevant, because insurance does not transfer liability it transfers a quantified, limited amount of risk. If I cause damage in excess of my insurance coverage, I am still liable for the damage and I&#x27;ll have to make up the difference.<p>But that isn&#x27;t the common outcome. The common outcome for a self driving car is for there not to be a collision. In the rare case of a collision, the common outcome is for there to be insurance which covers the damages. In the rare case the insurance is insufficient, the common outcome is for the vehicle owner to be insolvent (because owners with wealth to protect will tend to carry larger amounts of insurance).<p>If you want to be pedantic, the question of who has liability <i>is</i> complicated. But in the very large majority of cases the relevant question of who pays for the damages is simple: Cars are required by law to be insured and the insurance company pays. And if that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> the common case then it&#x27;s a strong argument for increasing the legally mandated minimum amount of insurance.",1382765530

   obscurity measure, precisely the kind he argues against.
   The linked article from the OP calls this out.<p>f: Spinning up daemons is a big deal for non-priv users?
   So spinning up a remotely accessible Lisp out of emacs
   from a screen that is running in the background is bad?

   are part of getting shit done. Users should be able to spin
   up the stuff they want to spin up in the network segments
   they have access to without the bureaucracy of misguided

   they think spinning up a gunicorn process or a custom daemon
   is worse than their unpatched kernel, apache tomcat and mysql
   listening on a publicly accessible address. Stateful firewalls

5465710,comment,5465146,5465633,3,0,crntaylor,,,"It's tough to know where to begin here. To refute the EMH you don't need a 'surefire winning strategy'. You only need a strategy that is profitable in expectation. And it doesn't need to be laid down in advance - all sources of expected return have a half life, and strategies need to be retired when they stop working. That necessitates continuous research.<p>Also, you seem to defeat your own argument. The strong form EMH says that excess returns are not possible, even with insider trading - which you admit can lead to outperformance. The weak form EMH would prohibit excess returns from the announcement effect, but you admit that leads to return predictability as well. Which is it - does the EMH hold, or is the announcement effect real?<p>Your arguments for why momentum, value and equity investing work also don't stand up. There's nothing to be ""announced"" in those strategies - you could apply them in a vacuum where you didn't know anything except prices and fundamentals. Similarly no insider knowledge is required. So why do you say that they are due to the announcement effect and insider trading?<p>You also misunderstand the scientific method - the failure of an experiment to refute the null hypothesis does not lend credence to the null hypothesis! At most it tells you that the null is consistent with the observations. Moreover, you talk as if the Null Hypothesis is a particular statement, which it is not. There's a great XKCD comic I'd refer you to if I wasn't on my phone!<p>If you want such an experiment, I humbly invite you to consider the past and future returns of the fund I work for, which is 100% model-driven.

5465690,comment,5461259,5463570,1,0,fecak,,,"Well said. I find that most that are trying to become great programmers place more emphasis on finding a great team above a great project. Of course, having a great team may be one of your criteria for what makes a project great.<p>I don't think the path to greatness or the concept of programmer skill are as opaque as you suggest, even for non-technical evaluators of talent, once we at least have some small set of evidence and indicators available that tend to suggest talent.<p>For example, if I'm approached by an engineer from a major player like Google, I immediately have at least an idea that the engineer should be better than average, simply based on the fact that this engineer has already been vetted by Google's hiring process. That in itself isn't a guarantee of talent or 'fit' (fit isn't entirely relevant to this discussion), other than the ability to pass a rigorous interview which does not make one great, but it's an indicator, and chances are that engineer will probably be given a pass on a first phone screen. Someone who has held a job for years at an esteemed tech organization (need not be globally known) probably had to do something right to keep their job.  Not foolproof, but fairly reliable.<p>Running references is another way to get some indicators. Granted, if a candidate can't find 3 people to say nice things about them he/she should find another line of work, but when you ask references the appropriate questions you will notice patterns if the references are being honest. I always ask about 'areas for improvement' as well as strengths, and if 3 references provide consistent answers to an area for improvement, I can be sure that is a flaw that should be acknowledged or addressed before hire. If you don't get consistent answers from the first few references, ask for more. Even a candidate's ability to provide references is another indicator of skill (not to mention soft skill, another element of greatness probably). Not foolproof, but usually reliable.<p>If working in smaller circles, you may know people that worked with this candidate that is not on their reference list. This is potentially dangerous territory to step into but I'd imagine a CEO making a large investment of both cash and equity would want to know what some others think.<p>Over the past few years, the technical interests outside of employment are becoming another indicator. I've said this before (as have others), but below-average engineers don't read or write Haskell code on weekends. This doesn't mean that all great engineers write Haskell on weekends, but that would certainly be an indicator of technical ability, and that indicator should have very few false positives.<p>The choices an engineer makes are also an indicator - not a guarantee, but certainly a signal. One might question the skills of someone who leaves a job doing very interesting and complex work for something much more junior or less challenging technically. These decisions start to create a narrative that at least suggest some skill level.<p>Of course, if we have the benefit of seeing someone's portfolio that is another indicator. It's difficult to judge an individual contribution to a group effort, but taking that type of evidence combined with any solo effort, interview performance, and perhaps a pairing exercise with your company's 'most talented' two developers, shoof provide some body of evidence for a decent talent evaluation.<p>A non-technical CEO could use similar tactics (not identical) to learn about a CTO, rather than relying on luck or other methods.<p>What makes anyone great and who decides who is great is tricky business, but it's mostly tricky when we have no prior info to use in the evaluation.  The path is perhaps a bit more opaque, but I don't think most programmers really believe they are in the dark (and unable to evaluate talent accurately) as you suggest.<p>My article wasn't obviously as much about greatness as perceived value and salary disparity. None of the engineers in my article need to be great, or even good, for the disparity to exist.  Your points, as always, are well made.",1364657925

I was just talking with my friends on how it seems like LeBron realized that he can be unstoppable; which in reality and from this read, means he's more efficient. When you're efficient at anything, it always look like you're dominate and at times unstoppable. Take Apple for example: During 2007 - 2011, they were on a run where we all thought the world would be iEverything.<p>I think finding your efficient level is the key indicator to someone or thing looking unstoppable once in motion. Meaning, once your startup is off the ground with a business model and making money on said business model, your next step is to find the efficiency level for which you best operate on. This includes all aspects of the company, not just sales. LeBron is an efficient scorer but also an efficient passer and defensive player. It wasn't until all things were working together and not in isolation, when people were like ""WOW!!!, I think he figured it out"". So if sales and everything else are booming but you have a very inefficient product development cycle, you will not be at your peak performance level. VentureBeat had an article about Tibco; which details this about having great technology and rocking but a sales missteps; which didn't allow them to get to their true efficient/ peak performance level (<a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/28/tibco/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/28/tibco/</a>). This seems like the problem with Apple now. They don't seem to be as dominate and unstoppable as before; which could be by design but I doubt it. The management shakeup and recent hiccups with Maps and Siri, shows that Apple is now not as efficient as it once was.<p>I believe when your efficiency level is found, you take nothing for granted as LeBron mentions is the reason he has transformed as a player. When you work at being great and the best you can be, you find out who you are and what works the best. You also find out who you are not and what doesn't work. You exclude what you're not and what doesn't work from the equation and focus on the variables that work for you. Only you can stop you, once you found your efficiency level that gets you to peak performance.",1364657377

It was cool and utterly beautiful. Then, because she knew the area and had friends there, we went off into the actual wilderness of the Grand Staircase. We hit some real back woods areas, explored canyons and hiked a lot of crazy places. We rarely saw evidence of other people, let alone actual people. I think in the 3 days we were out in the back country we only saw 2 other people and that was close to (what passes for) a road. When we went back through Zion on the way home, I actually experience civilization shock - there were like 20 people visible at once, and other cars!<p>They were both great experiences but I value the latter far more for a couple reasons:<p>* I would never have been able to find it, known how to do that exploration, and been too timid to do it without local knowledge.<p>*It was an adventure rather than a curated experience. The park is great, but I never felt like I was seeing reality. Like going to Epcot vs going to actual places.<p>It was still a totally touristy experience. The locals thought I was cute for wanting to go wander in the desert to see places I had to walk for a long way to get to, without knowing anything about the desert. I was still just there to see the sights. Yet different - they all were really eager to tell me about their favorite spots off the beaten path.<p>I guess what I'm saying is that I tend to interpret, and mean, touristy as ""not really worth the effort, it's too curated and sanitized and expensive. It's designed to Disneyify some approximation of local experience and does so poorly"".<p>Similarly when I talk to people visiting my hometown of Chicago, I always recommend the Museum of Science and Industry, and the Art institute.

All evidence supports the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), and note my use of the word ""evidence"". A contradiction would have to be a series of funds that applied a given, predefined (internally) strategy and (very important) didn't reveal its picks to the public (to avoid the announcement effect). Such an experiment hasn't been done, and those cases in which a specific strategy was applied have been universal failures.<p>Let's say for the sake of argument that there is a surefire winning strategy as is so often claimed in worthless investment books. If it were to be recognized and then applied, it would become the new market norm, everyone would apply it, and its differential value would evaporate overnight. That hypothetical experiment merely supports the EMH.<p>> Anyone who wants to claim that the EMH is true needs to explain the equity premium puzzle, the success of value investing and the persistent outperformance of momentum investing - among many other price anomalies that I could name.<p>Those result from a combination of the announcement effect and insider trading. Berkshire-Hathaway is successful because people expect it to be successful, and who invest in the same stocks when they're announced. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>The only fair, scientific test would be a strategy that is applied in secret, not in public like Berkshire-Hathaway, and in a way that doesn't tweak the market itself by way of large purchases that create their own following of fanboys. In other words, a pure computer model that is defined in advance, not tweaked enroute, that doesn't actually invest but only models hypothetical investments, and that shows its value over other systems in perpetuity. There is no such thing, and the EMH is true.<p>Remember the Null Hypothesis, the basis of modern scientific thinking. The Null Hypothesis assumes something without evidence is false. All evidence supports the EMH.",1364656819

I do think governmental threat is real, but I'm not seeing anything too threatening on the horizon, and it would need to also be on the global scale. But even then, look how much luck they've had with piracy (not much).<p>3. There are two things here. I don't like that it's growing this fast either, since it does make it less useful for spending it, and this may seem counter-intuitive, but at the same time, it's raising a lot of awareness and I think it's making many businesses consider it as a ""real currency"" - perhaps not right now if it keeps growing at $5 per day or whatever, but when it stabilizes a bit more.<p>The second thing is that it <i>will</i> stabilize eventually, but I wouldn't expect it to be a ""permanent stabilization"" in the next few years. If this is indeed a bubble, then it will probably drop to who knows how much (probably still $20+ though, at the minimum), stay like that for a few months, or a year, and then start rising again as people start using it, and those companies who've heard of it during its ""boom"" now want to start using it.<p>I know a lot of people see the rise of Bitcoin's value as ""unbelievable"" and wonder how could this be. But as with any currency, what matters is if people <i>trust</i> that currency enough to transfer their hard earned dollars into it. It's not that different than people buying Facebook Credits (or some other virtual currency) because they <i>trust</i> Facebook to sell them stuff (whether virtual or real) for those credits.<p>With potentially millions of people wanting to put their ""real"" money into Bitcoin and trust into it, it's very <i>natural</i> for the value of Bitcoin to grow this much, especially with so few of them around (typical supply and demand forces here).<p>But as I said above, the fact that Bitcoin gets to be worth a lot of dollars, doesn't surprise me, just how <i>fast</i> it's doing it. If Bitcoin was worth $1 million by the end of the year, without any real changes in the ecosystem (like say China adopting it as its national currency, or anything like that), then I <i>would</i> be worried, because it would seem too much like a bubble, without any serious adoption behind it.

Saying ""i.e., purity"" doesn't help, since I <i>already</i> knew that you think purity has something to do with generics being definable by people other than the language designers.<p>""If the language designers find it useful to occasionally use type-parametric functions, why won't they recognize that other people might also find it useful, too, and for other functions?"" doesn't strike me as a demand for <i>purity</i> in any sense. Consistency, maybe; recognition that the designers are giving themselves special treatment, sure. What's <i>pure</i> about the desired state of affairs, or <i>impure</i> about the present?<p>Honestly, sometimes it seems as if someone who wants to defend Go against a criticism immediately claims that the critic is just obsessed with purity. Why else would you criticize Go?",1364655639

Indeed, the fund that is widely viewed as the most successful hedge fund of all time, the Medallion Fund, was run for twenty years by mathematical physicist James Simonsthe same James Simons who lent his name to Chern-Simons theory, which has been studied extensively by string theorists.""<p>When are financial sector writers going to stop assuming that a chance success in finance is in any way the result of specific training or background on the part of a fund manager? One of two things is true -- either the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is true, in which case who you are doesn't matter, or the EMH is false, in which case anyone can make bazillions in the markets by simply applying the kinds of ""sure-fire winning strategies"" that are touted in any number of worthless investment best-sellers.<p>All the evidence suggests that the EMH is true, that markets are unpredictable, and all successes are chance successes. The Wall Street Journal ""Dartboard Contest"" supports this idea, to the chagrin of any number of stockbrokers and analysts, who would prefer it if there were any credible evidence that their services have value.<p><a href=""http://whyfiles.org/037wall_st/predict.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whyfiles.org/037wall_st/predict.html</a>",1364655607

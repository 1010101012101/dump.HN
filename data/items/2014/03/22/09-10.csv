The Kenyan 1 and 2 Shilling comes to mind. A friend at University from Kenya used to use those coins to phone home in payphones. I don&#x27;t know the specific exchange rate at the time, but they were worth pennies in Sterling from what I remember. The Irish coins, worth less than UK Sterling, also had similar sizes and some of the Australian and New Zealand too. Usually the coins were small face value, but even so, it was possible to pass them off.",1395482390

Or rather, other people can be critical too, but language designer&#x27; opinions have far more validity.<p>In other words, anybody can say whatever uninformed BS he wants (it&#x27;s a free country).

PHP is one of the most popular languages and one of the most used languages, so far from &quot;all programmers have a distaste for PHP&quot;. So if we were to use that &quot;voting&quot; argument alone (which I find wrong), PHP should be considered a very good language. Not the intention you had, I guess.<p>While PHP has it warts, it&#x27;s mainly the less pragmatic and more fad prone programmers that have issues with PHP, those who look for silver bullets and like to feel superior by choice of programming language, editor and the like.<p>As for programmers &quot;voting with their feet&quot;, well, they don&#x27;t do quite a good job at it.

This file is converted to a web application that can be be run to any computer. It is not mandatory to install anything to create a program, nor to pay a hosting solution. Everything is done on a web site.<p>The &#x27;pro&#x27; languages do very cool things but it takes time to learn. The language that is proposed with this project frees you from constraints of classic programming (asynchronous flow, data binding, ...) and focuses on the essential : to display, manage and calculate data. As a result, do not expect to create the new killer app with this project ;)<p>A video is available on YouTube to show basic features : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiccHCoJOlY<p>A demo of the language with some examples can be found on the web site : http://www.thelogicalbox.com<p>The service itself is currently in beta development stage but you can ask for an access code if you wish.<p>I hope this project can provide valuable support to people who need a small program but they lack the time, money or skills to do it.<p>It would be useful for me to have feedback, especially if:<p>1. The idea of a language for non-professional programmer is relevant.<p>2. The language seems simple and easy to understand.<p>3. You have ideas for improvement<p>4.

7448438,comment,7445685,7448120,4,0,haldujai,,,"As a Canadian in the healthcare field perhaps I can chime in as well.<p>When you talk about Canadian healthcare, it is a provincially run program (not federal) so let&#x27;s talk about it at the provincial level. As I am an Ontario resident I&#x27;ll be discussing this from an Ontario perspective, talking about all of the provinces and their differences would entail several posts.<p>Ontaio is currently going to institute (or plans to at least) pay freezes on physicians due to the rising cost of healthcare in a non-booming economy. However it is currently one of the best provinces in wait times. The provincial median is 6.7 weeks to see a specialist after being referred and another 7.1 weeks to being treated. This has increased 3 years compared to last year and about doubled from 20 years ago. For some specialties like orthopaedics the total duration is ~40 weeks. This is in contrast to the US where ~90% see the specialist within 4 weeks. Internationally we are considered to be amongst the worst nations when it comes to wait times.<p>Another big problem with the Ontario system is unemployment. 1/3 specialists, especially surgeons, are unemployed due to a lack of operating rooms and jobs available - even in rural areas. There is a definite need but with the single payer system we have, the aging population pyramid, and increasing healthcare costs we have there is no money left to pay physicians - who make less on average (at least in the surgical specialties) than the US physicians. So we&#x27;re graduating surgeons who can&#x27;t work and are forced to go the US to find jobs.<p>To address one of Dr. Martin&#x27;s comments btw, someone jwo develops a surgery/technique/game isn&#x27;t always the best person at solving it. Developing a mitral valve replacement survey using MIS techniques doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re the best person to technically achieve it (you could be, but it&#x27;s not a given as she phrases it). The US has a system that rewards exceptionalism and excellence, the Canadian system generally rewards mediocrity (this is even evidence in other fields such as law and even academia). The US is famous for having premier surgeons and state of the art equipment. A prominent example I know is in the field of limb lengthening, where until very recently there was not a single surgeon in Canada who could do internal limb lengthening, they all used the external fixator pioneered in the USSR. Even in medical education you are seeing prominent US schools teaching the use of hand held ultrasound devices which are supposed to one day replace stethoscopes. The US also has far more specialized medical fellowships focused on advanced techniques and tools such as using tne da Vinci robot system.<p>I can provide references if necessary (I typed this up on my phone) but most of these facts are readily google-able.<p>TLDR: Our system isn&#x27;t as perfect as you might think and is actually teetering on financial instability at the moment with up to 1/3 new physicians unable to find a job in the country due to funding issues.",1395481159

7448426,comment,7447505,7448355,2,0,danieldk,,,"I don&#x27;t think that is true, especially for Windows 7. But there are other issues to consider. Windows 7 is from 2009 and is still supported until 2020 (!). There is no Linux distribution outside RHEL and probably SLES that provides such long support cycles.<p>And even the comparison with RHEL is not really fair. New applications will continue to be compatible with Windows 7 for many years, while with RHEL you are mostly stuck with what you get with a particular version. EPEL et al. do provide some relief.<p>Suggesting that Xubuntu is a viable replacement is disingenuous - Xubuntu 12.04 LTS is supported until 2015. Let&#x27;s take vanilla Ubuntu 12.04 for the sake of the argument. It&#x27;s supported until 2017. A large organisation will not deploy a new system when it is released (many organisations are migrating to Windows 7 four or five years after the release). So, let&#x27;s say that they deploy it now. That&#x27;s only good for three years of support. So, in three years you have to redo the whole migration. Users have to be retrained now for GNOME 2 and in 2017 for Unity. You see where it is going, it is a mess.<p>Of course, then there is the issue that many existing Windows software doesn&#x27;t work on Linux, compatibility of LibreOffice with Office documents, etc.<p>Linux on the enterprise desktop is usually not a viable option, except if you already have good infrastructure to support and maintain it (e.g. Google), or for a subset of users (e.g. developers).",1395480770

7448412,comment,7445761,7445933,12,0,tripzilch,,,"> Hmm, trust cperciva to find the thing I&#x27;d overlooked.<p>I don&#x27;t understand. The whole point of not being able to post until your previous post is endorsed--which is strictly separate and independent feature from invisible-until-endorsed--would be that people stop and reconsider &quot;hm is this really the best I can do&quot; because if it isn&#x27;t they&#x27;ll be muted ... indefinitely?<p>Or can you delete your own pending comment if it seems that no one is going to endorse it for you?<p>If not, that&#x27;s going to become a huge chilling effect on unique thoughts and ideas that may either be controversial, or simply unpopular. Quite a stifling gamble. And even if you do get to remove that post from pending-limbo so you&#x27;re at least not muted indefinitely, that still means the unique idea hasn&#x27;t been shared, and in fact has been self-censored.<p>And will controversial ideas be endorsed? Because you said that endorsing the &quot;wrong&quot; kinds of comments will get your endorsing-rights revoked. I&#x27;m assuming, like all moderator-actions on HN, the user will get absolutely no notice or feedback about this.<p>Endorsing slightly controversial comments will be like feeling your way in the dark, err on the side of caution, better to just endorse comments that align with the perceived HN-groupthink (which may very soon become much realer, with this new system).<p>This is not a question of &quot;but we have to be better than that&quot;, because these processes run on the aggregate of a very large group of people. Very large groups of people are vanishingly unlikely to &quot;be better than that&quot;, no matter how clever, smart, talented or well-intentioned their individuals are.<p>So that will happen.<p>And that&#x27;s just the collateral effects regarding <i>content</i> of posts (I say collateral because they are at best orthogonal to the quality of discussion on HN).<p>Like cperciva points out, if people are going to hesitate posting if they are unsure they&#x27;ll be stuck in pending-limbo for how long or indefinitely, they are going to adjust their behaviour with regards to <i>all</i> factors that may influence how long it takes before a post gets sufficiently endorsed.<p>Which includes very irrelevant ones, like whether it&#x27;s a quiet or new thread. Or, you know, making contact, silly stuff like &quot;drop me a mail at <username>@gmail&quot; between two sub-kilokarma users in a not-very-busy thread, risk locking their commenting privileges for quite a while.<p>Sorry if I dare to say so, but overlooking all these things, it seems like you just considered only the positive consequences of this big change, and none of the possible negative ones?<p>Then there&#x27;s the final big negative one, which I think lacks a bit of self-reflection in order to overlook: HN already <i>is</i> quite the echo-chamber. These new rules are going to make that much worse. If, after a month or two of these new endorsing+feeling-in-the-dark+best-safest-to-conform rules do <i>not</i> make me feel like the quality of discussion turned into an ingrown toenail of monkey-discussion[0], then the most probable conclusion is: HN has turned into this echo-chamber (which seems quite inevitable), except it just so happens to be the kind of echoes I agree with. Which is probably worse than an echo-chamber you disagree with.<p>Hey, good luck. This community building is hard stuff.<p>Also watch out for the lure of power and control, it&#x27;s also &quot;hard stuff&quot;, of a different kind.<p>[0] your new rules are already making me doubt whether this is &quot;gratuitous nastiness&quot; or just a funny visual way of expressing a critique. this saddens me. it also makes me feel a couple of other things which I now don&#x27;t even dare to express any more. that&#x27;s bad.",1395480361

To simplify, this Arrington post leaves only two possible scenarios:<p>1) He had a huge scoop on his hands but he passed because he was worried about the safety of his business. Something a journalist shouldn&#x27;t even think about. Unprofessional and proof of a big conflict of interests.<p>2) He never run the story on TechCrunch because he knew the source was drunken bullshit and couldn&#x27;t be used for anything that aspired to be called &quot;reporting&quot;.

It&#x27;s probably been introduced because the salesman from the company that produces coins pushed it as the solution to widespread counterfeiting of £1 coins. At present people make really rudimentary fakes from things like painted lead, which they pass off as real.<p>For those who produce the additive and detection machines of course, this will be a bonanza - I wonder whether the ink company also sells detection mechanisms? It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how many vendor machines simply move to using cards instead in response - why bother buying a new detection mechanism when you could just stop accepting coins? I can imagine London Underground doing this in a few years for example.<p>At present machines and people go on form and weight, if the bank can add a certain response to UV or radio to that, it might make it significantly more difficult to copy the coins. I imagine the response of forgers to this will be to develop a UV coating to be screened on to coins which will fool machines (which are going to be pretty basic), rather than trying to mimic the material itself. Many machines will never use the much trumpeted benefits of this system, because it&#x27;d be too expensive, they&#x27;ll probably just go on shape and weight as usual.<p>These clunky coins are going to be extinct in a few decades anyway though - governments already issue more of their currency in electronic form than physical coin, and I suspect most people will happily use the internet and cards for everything and drop cash and cheques. At that point physical currency will be withdrawn, because it is such a burden to produce and police, I&#x27;m not even sure if you need a replacement token which can be shuffled around like bitcoin, or if everyone will be happy using verified transactions and ledgers as they do at present with banks.

I agree that jQuery probably isn't a monad, but it rubs me the wrong way that people aren't willing to say ""It has yet to be determined if jQuery is a monad"".<p>Obviously it is trivial to show that it isn't a monad by the fact that javascript permits any action in pure code, but by the same token, unsafePerformIO proves that Haskell has no monads. I think it's fair to operate under a reasonable subset of jQuery functionality when asking the question.",1365955154

For harder stuff you need a metallic hammer, which is heavier.<p>And the sad thing is, the Python-hammer can also be almost as hard as the other hammer while remaining light, it just needs some coating (faster interpreter innards).<p>So nothing (except besides the man-years of work needed on the interpreter) forbids you to have a hammer both light AND strong (== dynamic and expressive as Python WHILE many times faster).",1365955066

Can't you predict the cloud cover in any single place simply by taking advantage of real-time meteo satellite data? A similar feedback could be established for wind power.

5547141,comment,5546535,5546535,4,0,speeder,,,"I like this subject. Both relating to too much, and too few people...<p>First, regarding absolute human numbers, we do have too much, mostly because we are rapidly using up fossil resources (not only fuel, but also fertilizers), and some important ones already peaked (phosphorous for example).<p>But  I don't believe that making your population decline fixes things, it only create other problems, the solution for the problem that I mentioned last, is develop more technology.<p>Malthus was right on his diagnostic, wrong in the solution (please, stop blabbering that Malthus is some stupid dude that is wrong, even on school I heard that, more than once, by several different teachers in several different grades), Malthus was absolutely correct in his calculations, he only did not accounted for the mining of phosphorous (that is one of the major enablers of green revolution).<p>Now we are running out of phosphorous and energy, and our food will return to levels Malthus calculated, unless we figure new tech, I hope someone does so soon.<p>Now regarding declining fertility levels... This is a problem too.<p>In history, there are several accounts of prosperous civilizations that had declining fertility, and all of them collapsed (usually when fertility reached around 1.3 per women). Several of the current western world problems are related to that, the need of external wars to keep some income flow (alright, no major powers are at war... between themselves, but how much wars US, France, etc... are involved with other smaller countries and forces? Even Brazil that is not developed is currently participating in a occupation force in Haiti and in civil war, although the media refuse to count the latter), debt problems, specially coming from welfare programs and wars, economies that are following their population numbers (thus we have Japan for example with economy declining with the same speed that their population is), and a increase in far right and far left party powers (example: brazillian military dictatorship apologists never been stronger, Greek far-right went from having no votes in parliament to 7%, and a estimated 35% in next election, Japan also has a new far-right nationalist party that got some respectable votes, the rise of Tea Party in US and Democrats steering leftward...)<p>And some groups, know of all this, and have a plan to take over when they can... The most famous one being Al Quaeda (that is the Arab translation of the name of Isaac Asimov books The Foundation, and it was known that Bin Laden was fan of the series). Al Quaeda is clearly aiming to teach their followers to keep a high fertility rate, so that they can conquer developed nations when they collapse under their own bureaucracy and population decline.<p>All those advocating that to fix the first problem I mentioned (peek resources), don't realize that by doing that, other nations still have population increasing, some of them will collapse because of it and cause further problems for everyone (and most likely will ignore the attempts of developed nations to stop their own population decline), and other nations are increasing in population on purpose, knowing well of its military effects, and will use it against any fool that voluntarily decline his population and ends struggling to keep itself up.",1365953882

So, I, like you, would prefer python. And when it comes to Hadoop, as well as many other areas that university research labs focus on, they usually use python too, so there's a lot of libraries you can easily grab and work with, if need be. Also, it's easier to hand off python code to someone that doesn't know python than it is to hand off C++ to someone that doesn't know C++/Java.<p>However, in the real world, the customer is always right, even when they are wrong. Do what they ask, no more and no less. If they ask for a recommendation, give it. When they ignore it, don't push...just decide whether or not you want to work under the conditions / terms.

He was wrong about economic growth being linear (even then, it was a 0.5% per year exponential increase that just <i>looked linear</i>). The Industrial Revolution kicked in and now economic growth is (for the first time ever) faster than population growth. That change happened around 1850; until that point, per-person economic improvement was virtually nonexistent because population gobbled up any gains.<p>Economic growth has been faster-than-exponential as long as there have been humans. If you treat biological complexity or energy capture as the analytic extension of ""economic growth"" that goes back to the origin of life ~3.8 billion years ago: a faster-than-exponential curve that just happened to be very slow (but always getting faster) for 3.7999 billion years.<p>Now, we're also seeing population growth rates drop, due to causes cited by OP.<p>Malthus was right insofar as the stronger countries of Europe (Great Britain, Germany, Russia) spent the next 150 years viciously outsourcing their Malthusian catastrophes (probably without need to do so) to the weaker ones (Ireland, Poland) and other parts of the world.<p>Malthus didn't actually predict starvation. He predicted moral malfeasance (with his religious beliefs, this included birth control, although I wouldn't call that malfeasance) driven by population pressure, and that happened.<p>Humans are a mix of r-selective and K-selective impulses. Psychopathy is what happens when the r-selector within us is unchecked by K-selective conscience/fairness modules. The reason it is more common in men is that it conferred a stronger r-selective advantage in men (who could possess harems and ""fan out"") than in women (who are limited to about one child per fertile year, and 30 fertile years in a life).<p>Also, if you look at the ""corporate paternalism"" as more than metaphor, most people work in r-selective get-big-or-die gambits or large companies that have a lot of employees (children) but don't invest anything in them. Very few people work in K-selective enterprises that grow more slowly but invest in their people.<p>I don't think one can say, for sure, that the K-selector has won outright. I think that contest between the two sets of impulses still exists.<p>Much of how humans have imagined good and evil comes from the conflict (perhaps a neuroevolutionary arms race) between the r- and K-selective selves.",1365953560

I'll try to provide a little:<p>Traditionally, In Chinese society it's expected that in your old age you will be cared for by your children. That is, you don't really need retirement savings. Thanks to social change and the one-child policy, millions of Chinese don't believe that this will work for them. So, they are facing either working until they drop (<i>if</i> they can find some place to keep working in, and that's a big if), or saving for retirement.<p>Saving for retirement is very hard because the Chinese government has intentionally made it almost impossible. The currency inflates quickly enough that storing as cash is completely pointless. There are very strong currency controls that block any investment into foreign companies -- and even into profitable parts of local ones. The internal stock market that the Chinese can invest in is a total scam. This only leaves real estate (which is believed to be in a huge bubble), and the technically illegal shadow banking system, which itself is having trouble.<p>So in summary, the Chinese middle class is flush in cash, and desperately wants to put it somewhere, <i>anywhere</i>.<p>How large of a part Bitcoin will play in this will likely depend on threatened the Chinese government will be of it. While the system is technically sound, I have little faith that it could survive the Chinese government using informants and executions against anyone taking in RMB and selling BTC.

We used a real estate lawyer to draw up the contract and to have someone we could ask negotiation advice from if we needed it. Far cheaper than the 3% cut. Be aware that in most agent contracts the selling agent is entitled to the full commission if there is no buyer's agent, so how attractive your offer is depends on the relationship between the seller and their agent. Also, every agent you meet will try to get you to use them as an agent, so make it clear you are acting without an agent.",1365952488

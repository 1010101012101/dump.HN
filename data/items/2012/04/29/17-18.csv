3906512,comment,3903867,3906129,1,0,UK-AL,,,"Considering the average wage is also includes part time work, and lots of non-skilled jobs, AKA student jobs which drag the average down. I should hope a skilled full time worker, would earn significantly more than the average wage considering they have to support a family.<p>There are tons of dodgy plumbing and electrician scam schools(<a href=""http://www.plumbing-school.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plumbing-school.co.uk/</a>), which perpetuate the myth of 50K+ wages. It's in their interest, and it's entirely false. You end with a crappy nvq and no work but they get government grants to train you. I wish people would actually do the research.<p>You also have to separate wages, and profits when talking about this. Wages are what you can sell your labour for, to other companies relatively risk free. However profits require risk. Most of these high achieving plumbers money comes from the profit his company makes and not via his wages. That's why they always mention their self employed.<p>What this means, you have to run business and take a lot of risk in order to get that sort of money as a plumber. You could end up bankrupt, and that would not happen via wages. While educated people can obtain a lot of money with relatively little risk via wages. For example the barclay brothers took on enormous risk in order to get where they were. While someone  who went to oxbridge and then into a Investment banking graduate scheme doing underwriting took on relatively little risk. They will probably never be at risk of having their home taken away, and being declared bankrupt. However the barclay brothers had to use massive amounts of leverage(Mortgages, Business loans etc) and risk to come from home decorators to owning a business empire.<p>I also have to mention intelligence is fluid - <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15369851"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15369851</a>.

3906511,comment,3906335,3906335,4,0,simonster,,,"Yes, there is a time lag problem. However, instant distribution has been around for a long time (in the case of arXiv.org, since 1991). It's widely accepted in the physics community, but it hasn't gained much traction in most other scientific disciplines. I think there are two reasons for this: the chicken and egg problem, and the peer review problem.<p>The chicken and egg problem is that no one in these disciplines publishes unreviewed manuscripts because no one reads them. The corollary here is that if you do something interesting and someone happens to read it, take your idea, and publish first, as far as credit goes, you're fucked. This happens with any form of public presentation of ideas, not all that often but often enough that every scientist knows someone who it has happened to. If you just sank a year of your life into a project, you want to make damn sure you're going to get credit for it. At present, instant distribution is too risky. If the profile of instant distribution can rise to the point where a manuscript will be sufficiently widely read to be acknowledged as the source of an idea, scientists in less competitive areas may be more open to it.<p>The bigger issue is, I think, that scientists actually appreciate peer review. Peer review ensures both quality and fairness in research. If I read a paper in a high-impact journal, I generally believe can trust the results regardless of who wrote it. By contrast, any reputation-based metrics will be strongly colored by the reputation of the lab from which the paper originates. (I have a hunch that this is already true for citation metrics.) Replacing peer review with reputation-based metrics may mean research gets out there faster, but it may also mean that a lot of valuable research gets ignored. This still sucks, and it may suck more. Turning a paper into a startup that may succeed or may fail depending on how well a scientist can market his or her findings would absolutely suck ass. IMHO, scientific funding is already too concentrated in the hands of established labs, and these labs are often too large to make effective use of their personnel. Reputation-based metrics would only contribute to this problem. They would also lead to confusion in the popular press, which is already somewhat incapable of triaging important and unimportant scientific results. This is a much bigger deal in biomedical science than in theoretical physics, because the former has direct bearing on individuals' lives.<p>On top of this, citation metrics are simply not peer review. In his previous article, Richard Price pointed out that researchers need to spend a lot of time performing peer review. This is absolutely the way it should be. Researchers should spend hours poring over new papers, suggest ways of improving them to the authors, and ultimately ensure that whatever makes it into press is as high quality as possible. IMHO, the easiest way to get quality research out faster is to encourage journals to set shorter peer review deadlines and encourage researchers to meet them, not to throw away the entire system.<p>OTOH, I think open sharing of data sets among researchers will massively enhance scientific progress, and has a reasonable chance of happening because the push is coming from funding agencies, not startups. As a scientist, the idea of being able to ask my own questions with other people's data gets me far more excited than being able to read their papers before release.",1335722094

Equipment and reagents (especially enzymes) can be expensive. $300 for a gel box here, $1000 for a pipette there, $5000 for a thermocycler, $2000 for an enzyme, it adds up.

This is not as much of a tautology as it sounds like.<p>Think about the process of writing a paper: you do some keyword searches for recent articles on related subject. You then look at the bibliographies for those articles, pick out whatever looks relavent to your topic, look at the bibliographies of <i>those</i> articles, etc. What this means is that apart from your initial keyword search, the primary criteria for including an article in your research is: ""has it been cited already?"". Relevance is merely a secondary filter.<p>This paper pointed out the effects of this phenomena: the vast majority of published scientific papers are <i>never</i> cited again; a moderate number are cited only a few times, and the remaining few -- having reached a bibliographic critical mass -- are cited thousands of times. The authors of the paper made a strong case that this was not a good reflection of the quality of research. In many cases, the process of reaching bibliographic critical was simply based on the almost random chance of acquiring those first few citations. The authors provided several examples of important scientific ideas which had been lost for decades, arguably because they had not attracted a critical mass of citations in the years immediately after publication.<p>In other words, humans suck at pagerank.<p>Anyhow, it occurred to me that this is a problem which could be solved with technology. Imagine an online word processor which -- in a sidebar -- suggests potentially related articles from ArXiv and Google Scholar. This would be based not on crawling bibliographies, but rather on semantic analysis of the adjacent paragraphs.<p>I think this would create some real benefits. It would remove much of the problems with citation bias, ensuring that important ideas aren't lost, and also that prior research isn't unwittingly duplicated.

They also tend to conflate Unicode and UTF-16 which again doesn't help less experienced programmers realise that there might be alternatives.<p>I've been through the Windows Unicode stuff at a previous job, which ended up using mostly UTF-16 with some UTF-8 for interfacing to third party libraries and for files which needed to be backward compatible to ASCII (plus significant space savings, which I fought hard for).

It's not as if the people recruiting new graduates into the professions and complaining that they immediately have to send them for remedial training these days are making it up. There's nothing in it for universities to complain that new students arriving to study the sciences don't have enough maths to complete their first year any more.</i><p>Absolutely, but they're a tiny force compared to the parents who all want to send their children to top universities and will vote for <i>any</i> government measure that claims to guarantee that. If a party proposed outlawing university entry requirements, the vast majority of parents would vote for it in a heartbeat and begin making plans to send their kids to Oxbridge or wherever. They don't understand that such a thing would cause those universities to no longer <i>be</i> top universities - at least from a career prospects point of view.<p>And that's my point: for successive governments to want ""everyone to be seen to succeed,"" the electorate needs to be complicit in that. They have to see such things as success. If they didn't see University as inherently <i>better</i> than the alternatives - the result of thinking that more education is <i>always</i> good, and that formal institutions like universities are the only way to get more education - then they wouldn't consider a policy of increasing university intake to be valuable.<p><i>The only victims in this will be the children</i><p>The victims in this aren't the children: the victims are <i>everyone.</i> We <i>all</i> suffer from the system being broken. Some more directly than others - being unable to find competent workers is probably less upsetting than being pushed into enduring 3-4 years of timewasting - but everyone to some extent. And yes, that includes the politicians who, at the end of the day, want to buy quality products and to work with competent people, just like the rest of us.<p><i>Unfortunately, the corrolation between vote-seeking behaviour and doing what the people collectively want isn't very strong in the current system. Here in the UK, we've been to war for a decade, a war that everyone saw coming and that brought literally millions onto the streets in protest, a war based on false evidence given by political leaders who have suffered little if any adverse consequences personally and who show no remorse for their actions.</i><p>Hold on, there. We're talking about whether the government does what the people want or not; if it manipulates them into wanting something in particular, that's a separate issue, so the false evidence point isn't relevant here; many groups manipulate the public, not just the government. And ""millions of protestors"" do not make for a collective stance on an issue: the largest single anti-war protest was 1 million people in February 2003  - 2% of the population - but a month later YouGov were reporting that 50% of their survey group supported the war. Public opinion was at best <i>divided</i> - it was certainly not united behind one course of action while the government took another.<p>Anyway, one contentious counterexample does not a correlation make. Can you show a substantial trend of the government acting against majority polling figures across many issues?<p><i>Of course, it's also against the law to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to your child in public, drive at 75mph on a completely clear motorway on Christmas morning, or smoke a joint in the privacy of your own home.</i><p>Sure.

3906381,comment,3901252,3905203,2,0,joejohnson,,,"<i>Something created existence...</i><p>No.  That is absolutely not self-evident.  In fact, if something created existence, that would require an entity that operates outside of our current understanding of physics.  What evidence do we have for this theory?  Why assume it was <i>something</i> that created existence?  Maybe there are more laws of physics to be discovered.  Perhaps these laws will very neatly explain many characteristic of our universe.  There are infinite other possible explanations.  The religious idea that a creator was cause of our existence is unsupported by anything other than religious texts, and this idea is clearly not the sole possible explanation for the origins of the universe.<p>So in short, no, the existence of a creator is not self-evident.  If you use religion to answers such questions which are unanswered with our current knowledge of the universe, then you are being irrational, not analytical.  Before we understood that our planet rotates around the sun, there were numerous supernatural explanations.  At the time, it was thought to be unknowable.  But a few hundred years later, we realize that: 1) the answer to this question is knowable, and 2) the answer now seems trivial, almost obvious.<p>Modern theists, like modern rationalists, are likely to accept that ancient religious doctrine is silly and false.  Does a god pull the sun across the sky in his chariot each day?  No!  That's ridiculous.  Most modern theists reject these outdated theological ideas.  They have reduced their belief structure to one god; atheists just go one further.  It's the obvious next step in our civilizations movement out of antiquity and towards enlightenment.<p>The modern religious person either ignores science and all of the evidence, or sits at the edge of our current universal knowledge and posits that the limitations of our current scientific knowledge must be explained by the supernatural.  Fortunately, history will prove the religious wrong.  Our current epistemological and ontological questions are no exception.",1335719071

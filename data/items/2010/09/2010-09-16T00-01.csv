It's typically contrasted with <i>forgetfulness</i> or <i>fickleness</i>.  In this usage, ""faith"" is the triumph of reason, memory/history, and will over the emotions and difficulties that come with temporary adversity.<p>In Kant's usage, ""faith"" is sort of an extension of reason that also includes elements of willpower and morality.

It had an application which is basically a flash player (yes on ARM, the only one I know of these days) and it would cycle between flash applications on a &quot;channel.&quot; Some times it would cycle through to an advertisement.<p>It has an accelerometer, speaker, 320 x 240 x 16 touch screen, a couple of USB ports and a wireless network connector. You can wire up a USB serial port to the console if you have something like the AdaFruit FTDIFriend board.<p>It very much was the classic case of something &quot;before its time&quot; and the business model was kind of dicey. If you didn&#x27;t want commercials you were out of luck. Once the company shut down they left a server up serving the one App I really liked, &quot;Space Clock&quot; which was a clock like you might see on a Star Trek universe ship (it has a very LCS look to it).<p>The site has been revived and a new business model has been put in placed, $3 per month subscription for the ability to run &#x27;apps&#x27; on your Chumby. I presume it no longer shows ads.<p>Its sad for me because it has a really crappy clock app now that runs instead of the space clock, and that is going to force me to finish up my OS replacement. The thing is based loosely on the old Beagle board and much of the things that run on that board run on the Chumby. In particular there is a Ubuntu image for it.<p>I get the subscription thing, but I don&#x27;t get the price. For $36/year you can run quite a bit of server. A single droplet ($5/month) can serve up several thousand Chumbies (they don&#x27;t make I/O requests all that often). $3 a year would have made more sense to me, even $5 a year. Anything more than $12 a year and I&#x27;m just not going to go there.<p>The reason I have 3.5 is that the .5 is the &#x27;Chumby Guts&#x27; option that Adafruit offered for a while. It was all of the parts, minus the squishy case. At $99 for the parts it was a really good deal for a small ARM linux system with a touch screen. I wish them luck, and I&#x27;m glad they are back, but I think they need to rethink that price.",1404276138

I appreciate the sentiment, though in all respect it does seem like most of your concerns are addressed on the website, either on the fellowship page or in the others.<p>> unless you provide a little more information about what these &quot;hard&quot; problems are<p>The second paragraph does go briefly over the problems we are currently working on (granted, not in much detail for the sake of brevity, but enough to give an idea of what type of challenges they are). There is a little bit more information on the front page, but granted since we started Bayes Impact two months ago we haven&#x27;t been able to put as much work into the website content as we&#x27;d like to.<p>> Honestly it reads like your offering basic in training in a a random selection of tools<p>This is simply not the case -- while their level of experience varies, our current fellows actually comprise some well-established data scientists in their own right. It is precisely because the problems worth solving are <i>tough</i> to solve that we need to round up talented individuals who are able to commit to working on social impact projects full-time and pair them up with industry and domain experts who have the domain knowledge but may not have the time.<p>They each bring their own set of skills -- for example, someone who built Lyft&#x27;s grid optimization system might be uniquely suited to help save lives by improving ambulance and fire truck dispatch and reducing average emergency response times.<p>> and then hoping some non profits present a problem with nice clean data that can be solved through application of a few methods from scikit.learn<p>This is precisely the point of Bayes Impact and why a longer engagement model such as fellowships is needed in the space (most current data science for social good organizations work on a volunteer basis model), so we have the time to build these longer relationships with nonprofits to leverage data science even in cases where data is messy or sensitive. We go a little bit more in-depth about it on our article here: <a href=""http://blog.bayesimpact.org/blog/the-bayes-impact-mission/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.bayesimpact.org/blog/the-bayes-impact-mission/</a><p>> Worse 4-6 months might not even be enough time to formulate a problem that needs a solution<p>This is why they&#x27;re not 4-6 months, but typically 6-12. We do have a pilot 3 month program in the summer for problems that are comparatively easier to work on.<p>> and then hoping some non profits present a problem with nice clean data that can be solved through application of a few methods from scikit.learn<p>This is why we have a fellowship application page and not a project application page -- we actually tend to identify and scope projects ourselves.<p>On that note though, I want to point out there is no need to be so overly dismissive of the work nonprofit and civic organizations have been doing in collecting and storing clean data. For example, most fire departments we talked to had surprisingly good data, and some such as the Fire Department of New York had even started initiatives of their own to use data science to improve their processes. For example, by integrating building permit data with their own systems, they&#x27;ve been able to direct inspectors where fire were predicted to be more likely to occur.<p>One direction we&#x27;ve been headed towards is seeking these data-educated organizations to create pilot projects, then use the results of these as a basis to export these solutions in similar institutions whose data practices may not be as good. In that end, we are helped by some data engineers from companies like Splunk or Cloudera so we do believe in working with these organizations in the long run to bring them up to speed. This is precisely the problem we&#x27;re trying to solve with our model!<p>> For the record I work for a non profit analyzing complex diseases<p>Then you might be interested in the project we are doing on Parkinson&#x27;s with the Michael J.

This is... an</i> unusual <i>understanding of how business services work.</i><p>That might be true technically, but it&#x27;s certainly a common expectation among organisations that use SaaS offerings.<p>Moreover, it is a <i>necessary</i> expectation for many of those services to be commercially viable. Frequently the time and resources invested in integrating someone else&#x27;s service will take a significant period to generate a net positive return and outsourcing will incur a significant degree of risk. If decision makers didn&#x27;t have a good faith belief that a service they were planning to integrate would remain available for a useful period of time, approximately no-one would ever sign up in the first place.<p>Obviously many businesses do offer services that, according to their fine print, do not provide any such guarantee. They rely on their potential customers either not noticing or not caring enough to prevent them from buying.<p>(If you disagree, then if you&#x27;ll forgive me for using a personal example for a moment, I invite you A/B test Appointment Reminder&#x27;s current home page against a factually accurate version that does not make any claim that is undermined by the fine print in your Terms of Service. For example, instead of &quot;Clients get a reminder call or text message prior to their appointment&quot; in your main graphic, you could write &quot;Clients might get a reminder call or text message prior to their appointment, or they might get it late or not at all.&quot;)<p>IMHO, current trends like launching MVPs and exiting via acquihires are therefore poisoning the well. Potential customers of future services will, quite rightly, be suspicious of those services&#x27; reliability and longevity, and otherwise viable businesses may fail purely because of trust issues.<p>In the interests of fair disclosure: My own businesses depend on very few such services, and without any exception I can immediately think of, either those services are conveniences rather than critical to business operations or their providers have given legally actionable guarantees about their intentions/exit scenarios.",1404275363

It&#x27;s comparable to being a good interviewer, which is also a rarity.<p>You can&#x27;t just ask hard, probing questions baldly and expect to get accurate answers. More so, you can&#x27;t expect to do that and expect it to not affect your interviewer&#x27;s appraisal of you as well. You need to build up a rapport first and then you need to ask some leading questions that give your interviewer the opportunity to reveal some perhaps unsavory truths about their workplace. Granted, it might be hard to generate a rapport, or they might be too wary to tell you anything of substance or anything negative about the company, but that alone provides a lot of information regardless. If you have a hard time connecting with interviewers then maybe culture fit would be a problem. And if they won&#x27;t open up about problems then that might be a sign of a dysfunctional corporate environment that discourages honesty and openness.",1404273730

7975122,comment,7974728,7975075,5,0,peachepe,,,"&quot;This study had several limitations. First, it included self-selected, very deter- mined patients. Without a control group, it is challenging to establish causality and as- sess how much of the observed changes are specifically due to the diet. Only some of the observed beneficial outcomes may have been due to the diet. This study was not pro- spectively randomized. Nevertheless, this fact does not detract from proof of concept that major cardiovascular events occurred in probably <1% (and certainly <10%) of the entire adherent cohort, compared with 62% of the nonadherent cohort (TaBlE 2). These data convey a strong message of patients accepting empowerment to be the locus of control to arrest their disease and confirm that patients will adopt a significant lifestyle transition to plant-based nutrition to halt and regress what we believe is a largely food- borne illness.<p>The past several decades have witnessed a substantial and sustained reduction in CAD. Nevertheless, CAD remains the number one killer of women and men in this country. Thousands of stable patients having stents experience no reduction in major cardiac events.6 While drugs have some effects on disease initiation and progression, these in- terventions do not address disease causation. Not surprisingly, most patients experience disease progression, more drugs, more im- aging, repeat interventions, progressive dis- ability, and, too often, death from a disease of western malnutrition, the cause of which has been largely left untreated. We have in press several patient experiences that exemplify the repeated failure of present-day cardiac drugs and procedural interventions, and that confirm the capacity of whole-food plant- based nutrition to restore health in “there is nothing further we can do” situations.36\nIn summary, the present cardiovascular medicine approach tested beyond 40 years can neither cure the disease nor end the epi- demic and is financially unsustainable. The safety, diminished expense, and prompt, powerful, and persistent results in treating the cause of vascular disease by whole-food plant-based nutrition offer a paradigm shift from existing practice. We think the time is right for a controlled trial. But in the mean- time, the data are sound and strong enough that patients should be informed of this option.&quot;",1404273635

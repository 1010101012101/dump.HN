Interacting with electric, magnetic, or an other force is interacting with a quantum field.  Nothing new there.\n[/Disclaimer:  I read the comments above and declined to read the article. ]",1228823824

391199,comment,389277,390378,0,0,hxa7241,,,"from the apple dictionary:<p>USAGE 1 Hoi is the Greek word for the, and the phrase hoi polloi means ‘the many.’ This has led some traditionalists to insist that hoi polloi should not be used in English with the, since that would be to state the word the twice. But, once established in English, expressions such as hoi polloi are typically treated as fixed units and are subject to the rules and conventions of English. Evidence shows that use with the has now become an accepted part of standard English usage: : they kept to themselves, away from the hoi polloi (rather than : . . . away from hoi polloi).",1228823707

Except, I'm starting to think it's a loaded question, as your parent, I think, was implying. Due to our innate perception of things coming into and out of existence.",1228822502

If that means selling off the retail side and the infrastructure side separately, so be it.<p>It's not privatisation that was the mistake, it was the half-hearted politically timid way it was carried out that left Telstra as an effectively monopolist entity with the regulatory environment to help it remain one.",1228822307

391187,comment,390582,390616,0,0,yters,,,"I am into negative philosophies, it often is a lot easier to say certain important ideas are false than to establish an overarching truth.  One negative philosophy is that determinism is incoherent as a philosophy, since philosophy implies choice.  While simple sounding, that idea is actually very, very deep and cuts through every discipline I know of.  It forms the basis for my views on capitalism, technology, metaphysics, etc.",1228821992

She seems to have skipped chemistry: what physical mechanism can a bee use to detect these fields? After all they are made of proteins. What chemical mechanism would do it?<p>Plus saying ""detect quantum fields"" is meaningless anyway.<p>There is no such thing, it's a mathematical abstract, it's not an actual thing. There are many kinds of fields, saying quantum field gives some information about the type (for example that it's discontinuous), but it's not a specific field.",1228821548

There can be many 3D configurations that give the 2D images, and you need to use some knowledge of the world (or some regularization) to select which one is the most plausible.<p>A typical application is when they measure brain signals at the surface of the brain and then try to reconstruct what happens inside. Have people thought of using genetic algorithms and other stochastic methods ? Probably yes.",1228821506

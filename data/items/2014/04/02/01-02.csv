You would have been better served by existing systems.<p>So the marketing pivoted to being simple for MongoDB and being SSJS for Node. In Mongo&#x27;s case scalability was severely hampered by the fundamental design, but many developers fell for the marketing and it cost them. Node.js can perform on some hello world benchmarks, but writing large scalable systems was a minefield of instability, callback hell bugs, lack of JS support for CPU intensive tasks, etc. It&#x27;s still catching up to systems that existed in 2007.<p>The incremental improvement on scalability is nowhere to be seen. They do improve some other metric like programmer enthusiasm. Other newcomers did improve on easy scalability after more careful thought and years of effort but the hype machine largely left the topic.<p>A similar case can be made for HTML5/Flash promises for mobiles.

(Per Wikipedia, $2,000 of PC for $100 of software.)<p>But they, their company Software Arts (SA), made a distribution agreement with Personal Software (PS) that was grossly unfair to latter, and this became a big issue over time, because SA wasn&#x27;t willing to budge on the agreement.<p>So PS exercised their only club, that SA would have to port it to any PC model they asked for, and there were a <i>lot</i> of them out there.  So while SA was distracted doing a lot of porting, plenty of it silly, and did a generic port to the IBM-PC (forget which OSes of it), Lotus did a much better spreadsheet for the IBM-PC and the rest is history.<p>Except, there&#x27;s a bit more relevant about that, see my top level comment.  1-2-3 was written in assembly language by 6-8 people as I remember, and the team didn&#x27;t stay together after the launch.  Lotus didn&#x27;t have what it took to be a successful software company, clueless management that was kept afloat by stunning sales for a long time, etc. etc.<p>Their &quot;mid-life kicker&quot; is the best illustration of that: IBM-PC memory was limited, ultimately 1 MB addressable (640K until you hit adapters, but there were tricks you could play), so someone came up with concept where you could add a card with lots of memory and it would map parts of that into the address space on command.  Ah, now I remember, Expanded Memory Specification, EMS: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_Memory_Specification#EMS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_Memory_Specification#...</a><p>Two engineers at Lotus modified 1-2-3 to use it to great effect, but that was against management orders, and they left the company before it realized they had to use their code base to extend the life of 1-2-3, which they did for some time.<p>There&#x27;s of course lots of details I&#x27;m leaving out, like an attempt at a C language version, but it&#x27;s notable that one of the reasons almost all of Microsoft&#x27;s competitors failed is that they lost their ability to write software that mostly worked, generally after their first major version, and most especially when it came time to do a Windows 3.x version.",1396403091

7512983,comment,7503736,7510386,1,0,hrbrtglm,,,"Well, let me explain the structure I choose :<p>Each tenant is assigned a subdomain (No vhost, all routed by the app to the same codebase) with the name he choosed when he subscribed. So this name is retrieved by inspecting the host header the browser send while connecting to the webapp, this name is checked in the public schema to find an appropriate uuid assigned (if it exists of course).<p>Something like :<p><pre><code>  App_DB (database)\n  -- public (public schema)\n     -- tenants (tenants table)\n        -- tenant_uuid uuid\n        -- tenant_name text (same as subdomain name)\n        -- coderev numeric (for split testing)\n        -- some tenant general info like creation date, choosen plan, ...\n     -- some other tables accessible by all tenants like shared stats, queues, etc ...\n</code></pre>\nI then use this tenant_uuid as the schema name for this tenant :<p><pre><code>  -- &quot;b6e42fd1-d5b9-4de4-ba6b-6eca1dae06ff&quot; (tenant_uuid schema name)\n     -- users (it&#x27;s a multi-user webapp per tenants, so ...)\n        -- email (for auth)\n        -- password (bcrypt for auth)\n        -- etc ...\n     -- other tables needed for the webapp\n</code></pre>\nThis for each tenant, so some tenants can have a different schema stucture based on their public.coderev<p>When the user login, his credentials are checked in his tenant schema, the tenant name and uuid are set in his session for not messing with other tenants data.<p>I think there are 2 ways to deal with connection pooling (If we are both talking about PgBouncer || pgpool connection pooling to be sure).<p>- The first one is to create a new PostgreSQL user for each tenant in order to access only his schema. Then there is no need to set the schema search path prior the connection object as by definition his search_path will be set to $user,public (<a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/ddl-schemas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/ddl-schemas.html</a>)\nBut then, I can&#x27;t really see the point of a connection pooling. I don&#x27;t really like this solution, so many users, roles, passwords ...\n- The second (which I choose) is to connect with a role having access to all the schemas. You can set this one for connection pooling. The search_path is only set to public, and the queries use the qualified name to access the tenant data, ie: SELECT * FROM &quot;b6e42fd1-d5b9-4de4-ba6b-6eca1dae06ff&quot;.users\nYou can use the connections readily made available by the connection pool and query the data for the tenant you need without touching the search_path. The security is now dealt with the application and not the DB.<p>For the multi-version domain model, the coderev set in the public.tenants schema is retrieved with the tenant_uuid associated with the tenant name and then used by the webapp controller to route to the associated code version. No need for a second server, just a different branch on the same server.\nTransitioning a user then just really mean updating his schema and routing it through the new codebase. And that&#x27;s why I said it&#x27;s very ugly, because I still need to implement a good DDL and DML stategy in order to navigate between different versions without losing data.<p>Like you said, it&#x27;s a tough environment. Unfortunately, I have nothing elegant to propose but I&#x27;m also interested in reading how others deal with that kind of stuff. I still lack fluency to write a blog post or something like that which could encourage debating or discussions.\nI&#x27;d be very glad if yourself find some interesting stuff on this topic to share it with me, my email address is my hn username @ gmail.com",1396402021

Economics, and later  finished a dual degree in Physics. What did he do upon graduation? Dropped out of a Stanford PhD program in material science, started two successive software companies, an electric car company, and a rocket company.<p>Critical thinking is something you develop on your own through practice, and can be applied to any sphere of understanding once your mind is accustomed to it.

7785667,comment,7784739,7784739,1,0,scj,,,"I think that it is safe to say that the Surface is a failure.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean it should be killed, just fixed.<p>I concur with the article when it notes, Apple&#x27;s iPad is  a clear winner in the high end for now and the immediate future (I&#x27;ll bet the next 3 years).<p>But the high end isn&#x27;t the only market.  In the long term, the interesting market will probably evolve out of today&#x27;s low/middle end.  And ceding what was traditionally known as the &quot;white box&quot; market, not to Apple, but to Android, would be a huge mistake.  One that could threaten Windows in time.<p>For the short term, Android is probably going to hold the lowest end ARM tablets.  I can&#x27;t imagine Microsoft being able to compete here any time soon (as price is the big issue).  The best MS can do is try to make Android irrelevant.  If, 5 years from now, Android is seen as &quot;good enough&quot; by the general population, then Google might be able to use it to make a run on the desktop.  I know I would in their shoes.<p>That leaves the mid-range market.  And I believe there is value in a Windows tablet running a low-powered x86.  One that plays movies/TV shows, runs Office, has IE, and has backward compatibility with existing apps.  A tablet that favours price to specs, but needs to come in a shiny casing none-the-less.  This product isn&#x27;t the Surface 3, but there is no reason it couldn&#x27;t be the next iteration.<p>If the price was right, I could see my proposed tablet becoming the &quot;safe&quot; option for IT departments.  Once the basic form is there, help third party OEMs get in on the market, and slowly revert to being a software-only company.",1400785159

7785609,comment,7784868,7784868,23,0,escape_goat,,,"I am going to convey my experience of reading this, in the hopes that it might be helpful.  The message that I get from this essay is as follows.<p>&quot;We are angry with the way we are treated as women, by men.  We are angry with the way we see other women being treated by men.  Even though you might not personally have treated us like this, we know that you are a man, like other men, and we hold you responsible for what has happened to us and what we have seen.  You have power, and we don&#x27;t.  It is by your choice and negligence as men that we are powerless and demeaned.  You are not innocent, even though you think you are.  We aren&#x27;t interested in your opinion.  You don&#x27;t know anything.  You need to change to make us not angry.&quot;<p>The reason I think this might be interesting is that I know (re-reading the letter, especially) that THIS IS NOT WHAT THE LETTER SAYS.  For one thing, it is far from the only thing discussed in the letter;  more importantly, however, I don&#x27;t think this interpretation is all that fair a reading of what the authors have actually written.  I know that it&#x27;s a distorted version of what they intended to convey, and it might not even represent a correct interpretation of how any of them feel.<p>So why is this my impression? Your own conclusions are welcome, of course.  You&#x27;re free to dismiss me out of hand.  But for myself, I think that it has to do with the confluence of two factors.  Firstly, I don&#x27;t really feel that I have a lot of power over women.  Actually, I feel like women have a lot of power over me.  My life is inextricably entangled with the lives of women, and it would be a meaningless, barren hell were this not so.  But instead, and secondly, I am being told how separate I actually am --- and always will be --- from women.  I am being told that women are not being treated as people by writers who go on to talk about women, and men, and the relationship of victimization between the two, without hardly a word about people, and how people treat each other, and how some people come to treat other people differently, and what we can do about it.

I certainly do find it a lot easier to listen to and agree with people that aren&#x27;t spilling hatred at me. I never want to feel like I&#x27;m giving time to somebody trying to extract some psychological harm as revenge on my gender - whether or not they have a reason to be angry with the status quo, the target market often doesn&#x27;t last long enough to receive your message.<p><pre><code>   > We are tired of our male peers pretending that because they \n   > do not participate in bad behavior, that it is not their problem\n   > to solve.

It often seems like there might be the &quot;bystander effect&quot; at play, too. Not that you were arguing that and not to try to argue that this makes it okay, but just to argue that people taking responsibility when they have the power to do so are the exception and not the rule in human nature.<p>I agree that people should speak up if you see something wrong even if they just say something small, but I reckon it will be hard/impossible to educate all to do so. However if those that notice something is up speak up then it will be a better place for all of us. And for those that notice but are too shy to kick up a fuss, there is always more subtle signalling that can be used: tilt your body away from the aggressor, go quiet and start a conversation with somebody outside the group - disinterest, and &quot;awkwardness&quot; can be powerful.<p><pre><code>   *   *   *\n</code></pre>\nGoing slightly off-topic here just to say something that I care about. Something that has been quite difficult for me to read in other feminist pieces/tweets is the meme &quot;not all men&quot; which is often quickly followed by &quot;ALL MEN!&quot;. It might be annoying to have guys constantly interrupting to raise themselves onto a little pedestal as caring gentlemen, but this is creating a wall between two groups and we both need to work beyond the meme. @slatestarcodex made a very good point in an article [1] I read recently, which explains how both sides are affected:<p><pre><code>   > &quot;So the one problem is that people have a right not to have\n   > unfair below-the-belt tactics used to discredit them without \n   > ever responding to their real arguments. And the other \n   > problem is that victims of non-representative members of a\n   > group have the right to complain, even though those complaints\n   > will unfairly rebound upon the other members of that group.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIn nerd-speak what he&#x27;s saying is that you have a right to be angry with people that are victimising you and need to be able to speak about this, but at the same time when you say it anybody else in that group that didn&#x27;t victimise you often feels that they are collateral damage (and this is actually the case, the connotations will affect them.) I don&#x27;t know a solution. I side with you but some activist somewhere will hopefully step up and find a way of talking about groups in a way that doesn&#x27;t turn all men into misogynists, all germans into nazis, all whites into walking privileges, and all feminists into fat, angry, lesbians (or whatever people say to discredit you.) It clearly isn&#x27;t fair to individuals.<p><pre><code>  *   *   *\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t think all men are out to get you. I also don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a huge misogyny problem in the industry in comparison to some other industries and cultures I&#x27;ve mixed with. (Perhaps my bad luck.) This is my opinion from listening to the perspectives of the people around me and watching their behaviour around women.<p>However I do think we have a significant diversity problem and that it&#x27;s altering the interactions between men and women in the tech industry in a very bad way. We&#x27;re unfortunately at a point where it&#x27;s probably most difficult for women. There are enough of you to talk about the problems you face, but not enough that you don&#x27;t have your environment dominated by us.<p>I often hear tech men desperately wishing they had more women working in their company. And here is a big problem: it&#x27;s not because they want to give you economic choices but because of sexual deprivation. I&#x27;m sorry if communication is nasty for you right now, I think a more diverse group would stamp out the majority of shitty interactions and we&#x27;ll get there eventually. Until then some of those men are going to be acting nice trying to get close to you so they can eventually flip to their ulterior motives, while others will be running asshole PUA game on you to see what they can &quot;get away with&quot;. Finally of course there&#x27;ll be a large percentage of misogynistic or bitter (MRA) jerks that want to make you feel small so they can feel good - and unfortunately with the current diversity levels they have a voice. I can imagine it&#x27;s enraging.<p>Sorry if I inadvertently said something that clashes with whatever feminism you all share.

If I get to choose between the male that just wants to develop software and the female who wants to tell me all about how terrible it is working in our industry as a woman, I&#x27;m going to pick the male.  Why?  Because I&#x27;m very goal oriented and I just want to develop software.  Take your fucking crusade somewhere else please.<p>OTOH, and this is the mystifying part, I&#x27;ve seen just as many men complaining about it as women.  Guess which I&#x27;d choose if it was the female just working and the male going on about the female inequality?  I&#x27;d prefer working with the female.  That&#x27;s what a lack of gender bias gets you.<p>Did you know I was once dismissed early from a job interview because I refused something to drink when it was offered to me(I had a weird suspicions and had it confirmed that the offer was a &#x27;test&#x27;)?  I once got feedback from a job interview that the reason they didn&#x27;t hire me was because I didn&#x27;t show up with a notepad to take notes.  And l lets be honest, that&#x27;s not the real reason, I have it on good authority they already found who they wanted, but were fulfilling obligations.<p>I once had a CEO roll his eyes at me in the middle of a meeting and say something to the effect of &quot;you software people...&quot;.<p>We&#x27;ve all experienced the bullshit.  The truth is, people are stupid, biased creatures. yes.  EVEN YOU.<p>Do you think ugly people have it harder than attractive people?  Do you think younger people have it harder than older people in most industries?  What about southern accents in a northing US state?  Southern accents are considered &quot;dumb&quot;, after all.  I know of atleast 1 man from Rhode Island who <i>refused</i> to work with anyone from southern states because they were all dumb.  That&#x27;s a true story.<p>There are <i>so</i> many things that people can be biased about, yes, including gender.<p>The problem is that nothing has been so divisive in our industry in recent years as much as the &quot;discussion&quot; surrounding gender equality.<p>And me?  I just want to fucking get work done.  I don&#x27;t care, not because I&#x27;m an asshole, but because I myself am not biased.  Nor have I really seen a lot of bias in the places I&#x27;ve chosen to be.  I have seen behavior that&#x27;s resulted from the fact that males and females have a tendency to be attracted to each other.  It&#x27;s a fact of pretty much every facet of our lives.  It isn&#x27;t good, it isn&#x27;t bad, it just is.<p>One thing I would like to address though.<p>I saw a complaint about &quot;being called a cunt on a mailing list, and no one said anything about/to the person saying it&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s equality for you.  If someone called me a dick, or an asshole, on a mailing list, in no way would I expect others to rally to my defense.  I&#x27;d have to make a choice.  Do I respond in kind, do I not respond in kind, do I not respond at all?  Do I escalate, do I de-escalate?  Do I walk away for a few hours/days while I contemplate what to do, or do I simply blacklist the individual?<p>But at no point would I expect others to step in and defend me <i>for me</i>.  I&#x27;ll defend myself.  I expect it of myself, and everyone else expects it of me as well, including the women.  Is that gender bias on the women&#x27;s part?<p>No, it&#x27;s differing expectations.  <i>everyone</i> will think the person is an asshole, whether they called the female a cunt, or the male a dick/asshole/what have you.  But they may not say anything, that&#x27;s life on both sides of that coin.<p>Someone calling you a bad name on a mailing list just means you got called a bad name.  The name chosen may have been gender specific since you&#x27;re female, but that doesn&#x27;t indicate a bias.  We live in a society with gender specific insults... and people not defending you isn&#x27;t a bias either.  Learn to defend yourself.<p>Now being groped is completely unacceptable behavior for both sides.  That person should be dealt with immediately.  There are few things I would agree someone needs to be called out for, but that sort of behavior is one of them.<p>tl;dr;  STFU, develop software, and learn to defend yourself.  I have shit I have to deal with too, but I didn&#x27;t enter this industry to be told how terrible my gender is, I entered this industry because I love building software.<p>edit: One thing I should note.

This happens in any workplace (my mother was a secretary, and had to leave one of her companies because her boss was consistently making advances), but in technology especially so.<p>Perhaps this is a symptom of the social environment a lot of programmers seem to have in common.  A lot of us spend our teenage years alone or with a small group of very close friends.  Because of that, certain people might not develop a full understanding of social customs, or worse: deride them as &#x27;silly&#x27;.  This is a fundamental mark of immaturity, and most people and most programmers grow out of it.  Some people don&#x27;t, and I think it&#x27;s especially common among programmers because they (and yes, this is stereotype) tend to be very solitary.<p>People like us tend to spend a lot of time online, where you can make sure you only talk to people who are very similar to you (case in point: HN).  Not being forced to talk to people with different opinions results in stunted social growth.  A huge part of life is learning to interact with people who are different than you.<p>When you throw someone who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of experience with social norms and is used to having everything their way into an office work environment, they generally don&#x27;t mesh well.",1400783773

There were blog posts about harassment at that conference, but I never witnessed any nor did anyone in my group of friends, acquaintances and colleagues attending ever speak of being uncomfortable there.<p>I hear about more harassment towards the women I&#x27;m friends with after any given night of drinking at bars than the total I&#x27;ve ever heard from them about work.",1400783152

Thought I’d highlight my favorite, perhaps non-obvious feature: the slope of the charts tells you whether the variable is positively or negatively correlated with the cost of buying. And depending on the settings, that slope can change from positive to negative.<p>For example with the defaults, the down payment chart is flat. This means the total cost of buying is relatively unaffected by the size of your mortgage. Felix Salmon pointed out this demonstrates the Modigliani–Miller theorem:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modigliani–Miller_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modigliani–Miller_theorem</a><p>Of course, there’s still a big intangible difference between having debt and not having debt, like your ability to respond to market or income changes. And in an inefficient market, loans can be more or less expensive.<p>Playing with the variables and seeing slopes change from positive to negative or vice versa is interesting, too, because these suggest different optimal decisions. Like as your investment return rate goes up, the down payment slope becomes increasingly positive — meaning when stocks are doing well (and assuming mortgage rates aren’t also going up), it’s better to have a smaller down payment and put more money into investments. To a lesser degree, your marginal tax rate changes the slope of the down payment as well, by discounting the mortgage interest payments.<p>The magnitude of the slope also gives a sense of your risk: you can see how sensitive the equivalent rent estimate is to small changes.",1400783116

It&#x27;ll therefore be a fair while before I am able to respond to the replies I confidently expect this post to provoke.]<p>You know, at base, I think this is a class issue.<p>No, I don&#x27;t mean in the Marxist sense, so all you libertarians who&#x27;re even now clearing for action and double-shotting your broadsides, hold off a minute and finish reading first.<p>I mean it&#x27;s a class issue in the sense that acting like the assholes these women have found themselves forced to put up with, throughout their careers in our industry, is stigmatic of a <i>complete lack of class</i>.<p>Our industry, after all, revolves around a profession. We arrogate unto ourselves the title of &quot;engineer&quot;, despite the complete lack of licensure or regulation commensurate with every other industry whose professionals bear that title. It is therefore incumbent upon us to behave in accordance with our pretensions -- and especially so, I&#x27;d argue, given the relative lack of rigor which characterizes our industry as a whole.<p>Now, maybe I&#x27;m just an effete, precious little snowflake. But I have absolutely no desire to associate with people who behave in the fashions described in the open letter published by Manian et al., and in a thousand other places, by a thousand other women, who are themselves remarkable among their fellows in our industry only in that they&#x27;re courageous enough to tell their stories -- despite the excoriation they know full well will come their way in response -- in hopes of provoking change.<p>Such people lack class. They lack taste and refinement. If nothing else, they lack the basic good sense to recognize unprofessional behavior in themselves, and to acknowledge the solid reasons why the constraints of professionalism exist at all.<p>Speaking of which: I&#x27;ve recently participated in a couple of HN discussions around the topic of office politics. From them I have gleaned the impression that a lot of engineers consider office politicking to be something which just gets in the way of getting the job done, and is undesirable therefore.<p>To engineers who share that opinion, I point out that what we&#x27;re talking about here <i>also gets in the way</i>. Unless you&#x27;re willing to declare flat out that women have nothing to offer the industry, or unless you prefer to imagine that the women who&#x27;ve described maltreatment at the hands of their supposedly professional male peers are just lying out of some conspiratorial urge or other, I don&#x27;t see how you can evaluate this situation any other way.<p>Anyone who reviews my comment history on HN will recognize quickly enough that I have no particular fondness for feminism as a movement, or for feminist theory, much of which strikes me as ill-argued and overly reliant on an axiomatic infrastructure which is not so sturdy as its proponents seem to believe. Worse, by the lights of feminism <i>per se</i>, someone like Adria Richards, who reacted to a vaguely tasteless joke in so spectacularly ill-considered fashion as to end up getting three people fired, has no cause for reproach.<p>On the other hand, I see no reason why it&#x27;s necessary to have any fondness at all for either of those things, when the problem, at its base, is that there are too many assholes in our industry with no sense of how to behave. It&#x27;s not a question of &quot;how to treat a woman&quot;, as though that were some sort of magical separate category. None of the shit we&#x27;re talking about here is anything you&#x27;d be inclined to put up with for one <i>minute</i>, if anyone directed it at you. That it&#x27;s directed almost universally at women, instead, makes no difference. These behaviors, in themselves, are utterly unacceptable in any even remotely professional context. That they&#x27;re so widespread in our industry -- indeed, that they&#x27;re suffered to exist at all in our industry, to say nothing of the degree to which they&#x27;re actually tolerated -- gives every one of us a bad name.<p>I don&#x27;t like that. I refuse to tolerate the company of the people who are responsible for it. I&#x27;m not looking to start a movement; I&#x27;d be crap at it and there are already far too many of those to begin with. I&#x27;m just looking to see those of us in the industry who <i>do</i> have class, who <i>do</i> have taste, behave accordingly with regard to those who don&#x27;t.<p>No doubt some of them will realize why they&#x27;ve been excluded, and will learn better. Great! That&#x27;s what ostracism is <i>for</i>. If they can show they know how to behave themselves like grown adults, they&#x27;re welcome to join those of us who never needed remedial education on the subject to begin with.<p>And, equally without doubt, some of them will never figure it out, and, like MRAs, MGTOWs, and others who prefer abandoning society over learning to interact with it, will grow bitter in their increasingly self-inflicted solitude. Those, we&#x27;re better off without, and to hell with them.",1400782959

It used to be Blackberry, iPod Touch, HP Laptop, Xbox 360.<p>It started with the Xbox. I played a lot of games in college, but before starting grad school I realized that I would need to really bring it if I wanted my M.A. to be useful outside of academia, so I sold my Xbox 360, Kinect, controllers, and games (Halo 3, MW3, DiRT, and some others) for $150. I then bought an AppleTV and had a nice lunch.<p>After setting up the AppleTV I was really impressed with how easily it connected to, and streamed, my iTunes library and Netflix. So soon after I ditched the Blackberry for an iPhone 4. That, too, was amazing and I soon snatched up an iPad 1 and, finally, ditched the HP for the Air.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the Apple &quot;way&quot; and I am always amazed that, regardless of what new hardware comes out by other vendors, I am never jealous of anyone else&#x27;s rig or laptop. I&#x27;m never thinking &quot;Man, I need to get that &#x27;droid device as soon as I can.&quot; And I never look at a PC and think I&#x27;ll be ditching the Air and picking going back to PC.<p>However, I have coveted the design and hardware of the Surface since the very first one. It&#x27;s a really solid design that has only gotten better with time, and the Surface Pro 3 seems to be even better. I love how it looks, how it feels, and the utility of the device. The Surface Pro is the first device to come along since I switched from PC to Mac that makes me take notice of anything else.<p>Unfortunately, there are a few things that I dislike. The keyboard cover is too flimsy to be really useful, meaning that it&#x27;s really just a mildly-useful accessory that would be better off as a proper keyboard. Also, I dislike the stand aspect of the Surface. If I have a keyboard attached, then I shouldn&#x27;t need a stand, it should just lock in place, more like a dock than a cover (though of course it needs to be easily adjustable, but I&#x27;ll leave that problem for the designers and the engineers to sort out).<p>Other than those two things, the Surface seems like a really solid device, and so I&#x27;m genuinely surprised that it&#x27;s doing so poorly as far as sales figures go.",1400782905

You might scoff at this statement, but it&#x27;s true: Rust&#x27;s syntax works hard to strike a balance between all of clarity, consistency, regularity, readability, and familiarity. As the language gains wider use, understanding of these constraints improves; modern Rust has removed 95% of the sigils that characterized ancient Rust. There used to be <i>tons</i> of sigils, and many were largely inscrutable: ~, @, +, ++, -, more that I&#x27;ve forgotten.

The stylus on the SP2 clips to the tablet (at least, when it isn&#x27;t charging), it incorporates a button for clicking and an &quot;eraser&quot; that is a great UI concept, the software filters out your palm resting on the tablet to have really good registration of what the stylus is doing, and it <i>feels like a pen</i>.

7785224,comment,7782254,7782254,1,0,ogdenyogly,,,"This article only focuses on one aspect of &quot;busy&quot; -- working.<p>The real problem is &quot;time inflation.&quot; This is the name given to the fact that there is more to DO than ever because life is generally becoming more complicated, and because companies and government entities have decided to make you responsible for large portions of their business processes as a cost saving measure. Government is always the worst since the relationship is not voluntary.<p>Some real examples from my own life:\n* IRS sends me a letter saying I didn&#x27;t pay taxes from a stock transaction in 2011, tells me I have 60 days to prove otherwise or I automatically owe the money.<p>* When I was a kid, grocery stores removed the items from your basket and rang them up. Then conveyor belts became more common and you were expected to place your groceries on the belts. Now, some stores don&#x27;t even have checkers, you scan and bag your own groceries (fresh and easy for instance).<p>* Target has a security breach and <i>I</i> need to sign up for credit card monitoring and do due diligence, read my statements etc-- the banking industry has created a massively vulnerable payment system which requires my constant vigilance.<p>* I ordered an electric weed whacker from woot. It arrived broken (I&#x27;m already being used as product testing-- they should have tested it not me). Woot won&#x27;t take it back, they suggest calling the manufacturer. The manufacturer actually asks me if I have a multimeter and screwdriver so I can test various components so they can send me a new part. Buying a weed whacker has now cost me 5 hours of my weekend, as I have become product tester and repair staff.<p>* Get pulled over for a missing tail light, police officer writes a &quot;fix-it&quot; ticket for &quot;incorrect instrumentation&quot; or some such nonsense. What was weird about this was, the CHP officer who inspected my car said he had <i>NEVER</i> seen a ticket for this before.<p>* The city I live in apparently goes through your tax returns, and saw that I had $400 of 1099 income. The city defines <i>ANY</i> 1099 income as operating a business and requires me to get a business license and pay taxes on the income, I have to spend a whole day at the city hall getting a business license (I in no way operate a business) under threat of going to jail.<p>* Apple recalls my phone, I have to make two pilgrimages to the Apple store, each time backing up my phone completely and restoring it. Total cost, 4 hours.<p>* Anything relating to medical care is a CLUSTER, I could write a novel on just this.<p>Some more mundane annoyances are simply plays for my attention:<p>* Despite being very diligent about unsubscribing I get 40 or so emails a day from random companies I have done business with sometime in the last 10 years.<p>* The USPS brings me junk mail every day that I never, ever look at. It goes straight to the trash. Still about 30 seconds/day goes to this.<p>MASSIVE time sinks in my life:<p>* Inadequate transportation infrastructure in my county means I spend needless hours on the road.<p>* Purposefully poorly designed store ques. In the US most store ques are about 30% less efficient than optimal and all is required is a slight redesign of the area. The correct type of store que is where there is one line that feeds all registers-- in that way nobody can get stuck behind a customer whose taking a long time. (Think Fry&#x27;s vs. Costco). I shop as much as I can online but cannot purchase groceries online obviously.<p>While none of these examples is particularly egregious the net effect of this and hundreds of other of annoyances is that I always have something to worry about. All of these companies / government entities waste my time on to infinity because it costs them nothing to do so and I am powerless to stop them.",1400781738

I think she would have been stabbed before she could have reached inside.<p>No one intend on robbing you up close and personal is going to pull out his knife from 15 feet away or announce to you from that distance, especially in such a public situation, that he&#x27;s going to rob you. He wants to threaten you with a knife, not with his voice.<p>And this is what I mean with &quot;training&quot;: the reflexes to pull your gun instinctively when seeing a flash of a weapon in pretty much any situation, in this case: With your headphones on and watching some movement on your phone, as she was doing.<p>Maybe most gun owners are well trained enough to hit moving people at some distance, but I would argue, that nearly none of them are well trained enough to hit somebody who is moving within arms reach and will try to hit you with a knife/grab your arm/etc.. Most martial arts practitioners will say that they are not well trained enough to evade/fight somebody untrained but handling a knife.<p>>  you think there&#x27;s still an ethical issue?<p>I will argue ethics whenever the outcome is death, especially when there are bystanders and even more when the other option is to lose some possessions.",1400781736

When hair gets that oily, all the dirt, dust and grime sticks to it and it&#x27;s almost impossible to get rid of it. I tried baking soda, apple cide vinegar and few other things without much success. My hair had never been that oily.

Have you heard of, or come into contact with any of this abhorrent behavior that&#x27;s mentioned? I have never seen it anywhere I worked, or heard of that sort of thing through word of mouth, but obviously that&#x27;s a terrible sample set.<p>My experiences related to women in tech:<p>* Everywhere I&#x27;ve worked, it&#x27;s been a boys club, but we&#x27;d LOVE to hire more women. Frankly, hiring is hard in general. When women have come in to interview, I can&#x27;t speak for others - but I know in the back of my head, my biggest concern is, &quot;Make sure you interview with the same standards as anyone else, but make sure you don&#x27;t have some subconscious bias because she&#x27;s a she.&quot;<p>* There are probably good female engineers, and not so good ones. One of the few &quot;not so good ones&quot; I know of (doesn&#x27;t mean she&#x27;ll never improve, just at the time) had to be super carefully managed out over a long time. There was no unceremonious firing, that&#x27;s for sure.<p>* Is there even a &quot;women in tech&quot; problem? Or is it just &quot;women in the workforce, no matter the industry&quot;? The kinds of ridiculous behavior women are describing in these articles sound to me like they could happen in finance, sales, marketing, HR, or anywhere.<p>* On any of the open source mailing lists I&#x27;m on, I&#x27;ve never seen anything remotely close to, &quot;Your pull request sucks you wh<i>re, try again&quot;. Are these just the mythical basement dwelling trolls of Slashdot lore reaching out privately via email?<p>Most of the engineers I know in tech are decent, upstanding guys. If anything, I feel like if any of us was pulled aside by a female co-worker and she described shenanigans of the sort I read about in these articles, we&#x27;d probably jump to their defense in a heart beat, almost maybe too easily.<p>What have the rest of you experienced?<p></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i>*<p>Edit: I left the above (my OP) in tact. After re-reading it, and some responses, it&#x27;s become clear to me that it gives off an air of, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe these reports&quot;, and that&#x27;s not really what I intended.<p>I suppose my main point was that no, I haven&#x27;t experienced it, and I think that&#x27;s exactly what these women are saying - Just because you haven&#x27;t seen it, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not there.

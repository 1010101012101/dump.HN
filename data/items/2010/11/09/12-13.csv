All of those hard exams and impossible assignments where i stayed up for 3 days and nobody was willing to lend a helping hand. well, i solved those problems, got decent grades, and now my knowledge is solid. this in itself is a reward. so much so that when i finish my master's i'm considering going for a doctorate. it's that rewarding.<p>4) lastly, of all the things in this world, nobody can ever take a good degree away from you. you can lose your house, your car, your wife, your dog, your favorite whatever, but that college degree sticks around. as does the knowledge you worked hard for and the strength gained from challenges you overcame. you will become a better and more interesting person as a result. this is not to say that people who don't finish don't persevere and have rewarding lives...my school experience has actually been quite miserable and i miss the life i had before. but for all the punishment i've endured, i can truly say i've come out ahead.<p>there are plenty of people who have dropped out of college and succeeded wildly. gates, zuckerburg, biz stone, ev williams, jobs, ... and the list goes on. but when you're younger 4 years is such a small amount of time to spend on something. and when you're 24 and have a nice degree, you won't think twice about it .<p>look into financial aid/scholarships/grant money. i've managed to get my entire education paid for taking full time classes and getting good grades. it's amounted to roughly $29k (tax free) a year. plenty to get by on for a few years.<p>best of luck!",1289304302

Do others make extensive use of this?<p>Is it a good working assumption to design around the idea that ruby/rails most always returns nil as the result of a method call resulting in nothing?  (Obviously taking note of what actually occurs but starting from that general idea)<p>What other philosphies, tricks ideas do folks employ regarding booleans in ruby/rails?<p>My holy grail is a simple/clear/short best practices for boolean in ruby/rails.

181080,comment,180780,180780,0,0,akeefer,,,"I did the co-term at Stanford about 6 years ago, though my goal at the time wasn't to go start a company or freelance right away.  I'm personally glad I did it, and not because of any resume-padding or salary-boosting (I already had a job at a startup where I worked part-time while I did the co-term) but simply because it was a great opportunity to learn a lot of stuff.  I knew that if I didn't do it right away, I'd probably never really want to go back, and I'd also never have another chance to do it in just one year.<p>There are just a lot of things that are harder to learn on your own.  Want to learn SQL, OpenGL, TCP programming?  Read some web pages or some books; you don't need a class for that stuff.  Want to learn how to write your own database, rendering engine, network stack, compiler, or filesystem?  Take a class.  Especially if your goal is write enterprise software, which inherently involves building large, complex systems, some of those things will come in handy, if only by exposing you to new ways of thinking.  My experience has always been that the practical stuff is easy enough to pick up on your own, but the theory is always harder.  It can be done, you'll just learn it better and faster from a good professor.<p>If you've already taken all the 200 or 300-level courses in CS at Stanford that you want to take, I don't think you'll get much out of the MS.  If there are a lot of those courses that you haven't taken and that still interest you, it's worth doing.  If it's just a pure business play it's not worth it.",1209947306

181076,comment,180743,180823,0,0,neilc,,,"Most PhD and MS programs are very different -- I wouldn't try to substitute one for the other. Many good schools (e.g. Berkeley, MIT) don't really even offer MS degrees, and many MS degrees are coursework-based (e.g. Stanford's), for which you have to pay tuition. You're basically there to continue your undergrad: take some more advanced classes and perhaps do a bit of research, but mostly it is like extending your undergrad degree. Whereas a PhD is entirely about learning how to do research. Which degree (if either) is the right one for you depends on what you're looking for, but they are definitely not substitutes.",1209947176

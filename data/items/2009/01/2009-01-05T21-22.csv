421181,comment,420868,420868,0,0,mdasen,,,"For those who might not know how this speedup is possible:<p>Traditional databases use data structures like b-tree indexes.  These are awesome!  They look up data in log(n) time (n being the size of your dataset).  That means that as your data grows, the time to execute a single query doesn't grow so much.  So, what's the problem with databases?  Well, the problem is that as your data set grows, you're likely getting more queries as well.  So, you end up with m * log(n) where m is the number of queries that users are making.  Boo!<p>What about throwing hardware at it?  I hear that's all the rage!  The problem with that is that it's <i>really, really</i> difficult to split data across more than a handful of machines.  Replication is good for a few machines, but eventually you hit a wall with writes since writes must happen on every server in the cluster.<p>Or do they?  There's a technique called sharding that you may have heard of.  Basically, it's putting some articles on server 1 and some articles on server 2.  Then, when you need article 450, you need to figure out what server it's on and get it.  This is what MemcacheDB (and memcached) do.  They hash the key you give it and that tells them what server it will be on without having to actually ask each server if they have it.  That's a constant time process so it scales infinitely (unlike those hosting companies that claim they scale infinitely).  All you have to do is keep throwing boxes at it as you grow.<p>Awesome!  That's so much better than MySQL!  Well, no.  I mean, it is in some ways, but you can't say something like ""get me the latest article that someone has commented on"".  That might be useful to your site, might not.  All you can do is lookup by the key.<p>It gets hard when you want to do something such as getting the comments for an article.  You can't say, get me the comments for article 450.  You have to actually store a list of the comment ids in the article, get the article, and then request the comments based on that list in the article object.  Worse, lets say two people comment on an article at the same time.  You'd better make sure you start a transaction before reading the object, modify the list, and save it.  If you don't, you'll hit race conditions that can see a comment's association lost (something you don't have to worry about with foreign-key associations).<p>Plus, beyond that trouble, you still can't say ""get me the article with the most comments"".<p>To an extent, I'm wondering how this is much better than memcached.  If you still need/want an RDBMS for query capabilities, do you really need another key-store that saves to disk?  memcached can always be reconstituted from the RDBMS if a server fails, but I guess MemcacheDB forgoes that warm-up process (similar to the Shop.com Cache) and that can be a bonus.  However, it's a lot slower than memcached due to the disk access.<p>It looks really interesting, but I'm not sure how useful it would be (I should say, in my line of work).  I won't give up queries and their site says emphatically that it's not a cache.  If you're doing something that needs a simple key-value store, this is going to be an amazing product.",1231191819

These are all real costs of every purchase you make, but often not ""included"" in the price.<p>Living on less leaves more scarce resources for use by others whether now or in the future, and sends less crap to landfills. Label me a moralizer if you like, but I think it is smart for society to encourage individuals to think beyond themselves.

421132,comment,420523,420523,0,0,marvin,,,"The reason this flies well is that it is a proper airplane. Most paper airplane designs I have seen don't have a horizontal stabilizer, which will usually doom the plane to crash.<p>Without a tail section, most airplanes are unstable in the pitch plane - the resultant force from the aerodynamic lift doesn't work from the same point on the wing as the center of gravity. An additional horizontal lift surface is required to make sure the plane doesn't pitch up and stall.<p>The point the author makes about the center of gravity is good - with the center of gravity far forward, the airplane will have a smaller angle of attack (and hence less lift) for any given airspeed, and hence the plane will end up in stable flight at a higher speed, with a resulting higher margin for how strong gusts are required for it to stall and crash.<p>This is pretty basic applied aerodynamics, but not very common knowledge among the kindergarten teachers who teach the art of making paper airplanes.<p>This thing <i>might</i> fly if you remove the tail, because the center of gravity is far below the resultant lift center - there is some trick here that can allow you to get by without a horizontal stabilizer. Paragliders and hang gliders use this, but I don't know why it works. Actually, the instructions on this site are pretty neat and probably a good way to learn about practical aerodynamics. On the ""how to fly"" page, they explain how you can trim the plane for higher or lower speeds by adjusting the tail section and making ""flaps"" - changing the shape of the wing in order to alter the lift coefficient (how much lift you get at a given airspeed and angle of attack)",1231190099

If unemployment goes from 5% to 20% the drop in income does not change much on a year over year basis, but just about every other asset class is going to tank.  If unemployment stays over 20% vary long there is not much that can save your retirement.<p>The reason to fund SS with workers income is it's more stable than just about everything else in the economy.  Inflation or deflation and people still make about as much money.<p>If you have 5x what you need to live off of and it's extremely diversified then it's not a problem but what's the point in waiting that long?<p>You might have 20% cash on hand but how long is that going to last you?

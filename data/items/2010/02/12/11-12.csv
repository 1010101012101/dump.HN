Including Germany, Denmark, Lichtenstein and Switzerland.<p>> In this case Germany has a right to the information.<p>Well, states don't have rights. Their citizens are required to hand over the information, and the government is entitled to punish citizens that fail to do so. But that's a minor point -- Yes, Germany is entitled to that information, but they don't have a right to break the law of another country to get that information. What happened to Lichtensteins right to sovereignty?<p>And what if it wasn't tax information, but information on ethnicity? Seriously, information about citizens that one government ""has a right to"", that another government doesn't mind helping you conceal. Not to bash Germany in particular, but we have privacy laws for a reason.<p>I'm not a fan of tax-evasion, but tax collection is not, in itself, such a holy venture that it warrants any means.",1265975838

Posting comments just because you feel that you're right doesn't help anyone.  It makes the person you're talking to feel annoyed, and doesn't change their point of view.  And if your opinion happens to be the popular opinion, then that will incite a mob downvote of their (possibly insightful or interesting but unpopular) comment, and a mob upvote of your useless ""I'm right because I'm right"" comment.  It's demoralizing to spend a lot of time crafting a comment, only to have it mass-downvoted just because it's unpopular, and to have some thoughtless reply massively upvoted just because it's popular.<p>I mean, you see where I'm coming from, right?<p>It's this kind of train of thought that's destroying HN.  The thought that it's okay to not put in effort into commenting.  The conversation on HN is where the magic is at -- if the conversation goes to hell, then HN is doomed.<p>And thank you for trying to communicate your position, even if it was just a single sentence.  As far as my response, well... I really don't see a significant chance of me getting hurt.  I'm basically paranoid when I drive, and a car accident is pretty much the only thing that could seriously injure me.  Health insurance is $300/mo that I just don't need to spend.",1265975633

I am a C++ expert (10 years and counting) and I've never read a single book on C++ in my life.

(If they have a point, then use their technique of course -- but if it's like ""All objects should be declared as noncopyable!"" then ignore it.  99% of the time, objects should be considered not-safe-to-copy, so there's no reason to bloat the code by declaring objects as noncopyable.

Boost seriously bloats the code (compilation times shoot <i>way</i> up, and there is runtime overhead as well, not to mention that if you want to send your code to someone then they need to have Boost installed to even compile it).  I don't use smart pointers at all, and my code doesn't crash or have memory leaks.  It's not hard to write a manager class that allocates a type of object and adds it to an internal list, then de-allocates all of the objects when the manager destructs.<p>Write a program in the simplest possible way you can think of to get it working correctly.  Then re-write your code entirely, so that it's more readable and cleaner (and commented).  Format the code using tabs / whitespace so that the code is even more readable.

The rates would end up being cheaper than the ADSL/cable people already had, but still no go.<p>Originally, we were supposed to bring on board more than 20 people, but the company installing the link felt so bad for us that they went ahead with the few we managed to find anyways.<p>And then we moved to get out of the city. Back to unstable and horrible cable. Bleh.",1265972538

I think it's because capping downvoting to -4 is still too low.<p>I really wish downvoting was capped at 0.  That way, comments still get filtered to the bottom, but people who get downvoted (and spent ~20 minutes writing the comment) don't feel like they just wasted their time for no reason at all.  Seeing my (interesting, if inflammatory) comment at -4 when a ridiculing reply was at 5 just set me off.",1265972447

One is about double the size of the other and the 10 hours quote on the Lenovo page is ""up to"", so is the larger battery.  My guess is that the original poster has the other one (which is more compact).<p>[Disclaimer: another X60 user here]",1265972425

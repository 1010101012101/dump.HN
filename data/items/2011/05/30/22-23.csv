If safety systems can keep human drivers from having accidents by stopping vehicles before they can have an accident, they can do the same for robotic vehicles.<p>Such systems would place limits on how fast you could accelerate, turn the wheel or apply the brakes.  And they would also brake for you when other vehicles, pedestrians and animals appear to be on a collision course.<p>Such systems will have to be proven in the real world.

2600656,comment,2595618,2597304,1,0,wbhart,,,"The recurrent laryngeal nerve actually gives off several filaments to part of the cardiac plexus. On its way up it gives off fibres to the mucous membrane and muscular coating of the esophagus and similarly for the trachea, and then some pharyngeal filaments before reaching most of the laryngeal muscles (See Gray's Anatomy 1980).<p>During development the nerve elongates as the heart is forced down from the neck region into the thoracic cavity due to formation of structures in between. The RLN is surrounded by an unusual amount of connective tissue and actually supports the ductus arteriosis during development (the arterial duct that bypasses the baby's lungs during fetal development).<p>It has also been argued that the recurrent laryngeal nerve is actually less prone to damage by following the ""groove"" that it follows.<p>What is known is that the two sets of laryngeal nerves are responsible for innervating different vocal characteristics.\nIn effect, the proposed route of the design critics already exists. But the RLN exists anyway, providing, in the case of the larynx, a somewhat ""redundant"" backup, after performing other more obvious functions. As is well-known, the body is full of ""redundant"" backups, e.g. if a given artery is cut, blood can often still reach the intended destination through secondary backup routes.<p>Stimulation of the vagus nerve, off which the RLN branches, is known to lower heart rate and blood pressure. This can occur as a result of emotional stress. At this time, not enough is known about either the innervation of the larynx or the sympathetic interplay between the organs that the RLN innervates to be certain of any conclusions.<p>Multiple possibilities remain: (i) there is a function (possibly sympathetic) which is not yet understood, (ii) developmental considerations impose restrictions on possible trajectories, (iii) the nerve follows a very different route to that of the superior laryngeal nerve to provide additional protection not available in a more direct and developmentally viable route, (iv) it's bad design, (v) it's merely an artifact of unguided evolution, (vi) something we didn't think of.<p>What I was complaining about is that the article basically ignored all of this and presented a highly simplified argument. Even the first diagram gives the impression that the nerve comes down from the brain in a single sealed bundle like a pipe, loops around the aorta, then heads straight for the larynx without interruption. This is misleading at best. It is coincidentally the case that there is a great deal of variation in the course of the nerve from individual to individual. There are some hard constraints, and other things that are not constrained at all.<p>As with any complex interacting system, understanding the precise constraints in this particular biological feature is a challenging scientific problem. To simply assume ""evolution did it"" without careful investigation is moribund science.<p>The original argument of the article was made in published literature at least as early as 2001 (Intelligent Design Creationism and its Critics, Kelly C. Smith) and has been recycled very often since then. It is not the only example of supposed poor design in the body of mammals, some of which are now understood to have very important functions, which may be either viewed as evidence of good design or of elements that have been preserved by evolution for a reason.",1306795929

With hardware whilst you can design top-down, the implementations, especially whilst you are learning, needs to be bottom-up.  Like TDD, you implement and test each module before you integrate it into a larger module and test that, rinse and repeat ...<p>When designing hardware you need to keep in mind how the software will interact with it.  And when designing software you might want to think about how the hardware could help you simplify the design.  A general word of advice, keep the hardware as unspecialized as possible.

2600609,comment,2600489,2600590,4,0,jmtame,,,"Wow. Thanks. That strategy was coincidental; I only knew I'd have to promote the book once I finished it, but I didn't know how I'd do that. As about a week ago, I got ranked in the top 50 bestsellers in 3 different categories, so Amazon is basically promoting the book for me right now. I'm trying to understand how the Amazon ranking algorithm works--I reduced the Kindle price from $9.99 to $2.99, and I am still unsure whether they weight downloads or absolute revenue higher. If I had to guess, they look at number of downloads first to rank your book, and I also assume reviews and ratings play an important role so I've been encouraging people to write reviews if they like it. I'll bump the price back up to $9.99 tomorrow and see how it affects the rank.<p>As for other methods of promoting, I'm always experimenting. I've noticed that giving away more content is a good thing, for example. You mentioned after reading Wufoo's interview that you decided to buy, but that was not intuitive to me; someone else who is an expert in the publishing space advised me to give away more interviews. I wanted to give away one interview per day for a week, and then realized I'd have to get the founders' permission. The first person I asked said he didn't want his interview to be cached by Google because it's too personal. So I thought maybe I'd just open the interviews up after companies get acquired, for example.<p>I'm interviewing John Resig tomorrow, and I'll make all of that publicly open. If you have some questions you want me to ask, please let me know, my list of questions so far: <a href=""http://bit.ly/mHhA37"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/mHhA37</a>. Stuff like that helps promote the book to varying degrees. Still in an experimental phase with everything.<p>Someone is interviewing me for an article on Friday to talk about how I've made sales post-AppSumo. So I'll cover everything I've done to promote the book in that interview (will post a link on the blog when it's ready). I have a blog halfway written on the topic, so hopefully will finish that soon (this book is paying my rent while I'm trying to focus on doing my other startup, so I'm not giving the book 100% of my focus right now).",1306794583

If you link to GPL code, then your code has to, at least, grant GPL rights to your users. However, just using GPL code to build your code is not. I use Emacs to write code that is either interpreted by Python or compiled by GCC and nothing I write needs to be licensed as GPL. A lot of OSX is compiled with GCC and many programs on the OSX install DVD are BSD licensed.<p>Unless you link to a GPL-only library, you are probably safe.<p>As for other licenses, there are licenses like BSD and Apache. You can pick code licensed under them and use it as part of proprietary code you release. OTOH, your competitor may use the BSD-ish code you release as parts of your competing product.",1306794548

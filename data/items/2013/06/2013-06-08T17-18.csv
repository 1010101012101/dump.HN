I bet there is literally a handful of countries your average HN-er would rather live in than the U.S., and before the economic liberalization of Europe in the 1990&#x27;s, it was probably less than that. Our prosperity has been supported by an incredibly stable government, one that is, 224 years after its founding, freer than it ever has been (read up on the Alien and Sedition Acts).<p>It&#x27;s easy to take what we have for granted, but it&#x27;s important to maintain perspective. The cause of the republic is not served by those who declare it hopelessly broken and disengage. In the light of historical perspective, you realize that there have been many times in the past when the government was more corrupt than it is now, when society was less free than it is now, and that&#x27;s a liberating thought because it means that the trend of government does not point inevitably towards corruption and repression.",1370714299

What parts of the request handling are done by humans with decision-making authority vs what parts are handled by machines or by humans following a rigid script.

What is the speed and scale of the process<p>How quickly are these requests fulfilled. How much data comes back from a request. What proportion of this data is relevant to the target and the investigation vs incidental. How many requests are there per month or per year. How much data is gathered per month or per year.<p>Side-issues not covered above:<p>Is the access direct. Is there a back door. Is access given to servers. Is access given to a network.

We were very surprised to learn that such broad orders exist. Any suggestion that Google is disclosing information about our users Internet activity on such a scale is completely false.</i><p>Now that could conceivably be a bald lie - or I suppose they could <i>just</i> conceivably have lost awareness of what their FISA/NSL/warrant-handling lawyers were approving, to a spectacular extent - but otherwise they aren&#x27;t handling any Verizon-scale FISA warrants. However, you&#x27;re right: there&#x27;s a big grey area between Verizon-scale &quot;megawarrants&quot; and the &quot;specific orders about individuals&quot; the tech companies say they process. NYT said &quot;FISA orders can range from inquiries about specific people to a broad sweep for intelligence, like logs of certain search terms&quot; while the tech companies largely reasserted that they only process &quot;specific orders about individuals&quot;. It seems that only one source can be accurate here.<p>BTW I assume that Verizon wasn&#x27;t really just forced into handing over all its metadata: there was probably a bit of a gentleman&#x27;s agreement in the government producing an omnibus FISA order and Verizon agreeing not to contest its legality. Everyone spends less time processing FISA orders, the government gets all the metadata it wants, and Verizon gets a sicknote to cover it legally.",1370714073

5845609,comment,5845012,5845012,9,0,gracenotes,,,"A brief summary:<p>* Nowadays, we have the concept of interfaces to achieve modularity and local reasoning<p>* Liskov&#x27;s initial contribution: partition global variables, require functions to only use variables in their partition or call functions in other partitions.<p>* Use data abstraction as a methodology (later on, use object orientation as the target of that methodology)<p>* She created CLU to communicate some of these abstractions to programmers: 1. Procedures are attached to types, not objects, 2. Parametric polymorphism: if quantification is needed, use structural subtyping, essentially, 3. For loops: use iterators with state stored on the stack (generators)<p>* When looking at object orientation in this context, she found that inheritance was widely used, both for interface/implementation and for type hierarchies. In both cases, semantics are important, even if two objects implement the same methods by name/types. Came up with Liskov substitution principle.<p>* Trends today: one of the issues with e.g. Java, C# is that they&#x27;re not great for beginners who are forced to work around crufty abstractions (public static void main) without having the experience to know how to generally use those abstractions. On the other hand, Python is great for beginners but (according to Liskov) doesn&#x27;t have great data abstraction for large-scale software engineering.<p>* Some perceived tradeoffs in a language that is good for both beginners and experts: 1. Ease of use vs expressive power, 2. Readability vs writeability (Liskov is worried about too much focus on the latter), 3. Modularity and abstraction, 4. Powerful abstraction matters, 5. State matters (see below)<p>* Finally, for massively parallel computers: how to do programming methodology?<p>That&#x27;s what I thought to write down. I also thought to take a more precise transcript of her comments on Haskell:<p>> My final thing, which is in some sense aimed at Haskell, is that state matters. So, mostly computer programs are about managing state. And, although I am very sympathetic with the desire to keep most of your program immutable, because it&#x27;s much easier to reason about correctness if you aren&#x27;t doing modifications, a major part of your program is going to be concerned with state, and it has to be done in a simple way. It can&#x27;t be complicated, it can&#x27;t be hard to understand.<p>State is one of the most important (and sometimes annoying) things you deal with in Haskell when writing large programs. However, is it really better to sweep it under the rug and muddy semantics in the name of simplicity? One might merely just be pushing essential complexity to where it is harder to reason about.",1370713921

And we&#x27;ve learned more recently that Mars appears to have had sufficient water to form long-lived lakes and rivers, long enough to allow the formation of both rounded river rocks and pebbles as well as conglomerate rocks made up of those but also hydrate minerals that can only form in conditions of near neutral pH and low salinity.<p>These are big discoveries, even though from a certain perspective they may seem like yet another &quot;water on Mars!&quot; story. These discoveries are painting a picture of ancient Mars that was not just occasionally wet or perhaps a hellscape Mars covered with brackish or boiling lakes but an almost familiar Mars with lakes and rivers that would be nearly drinkable for humans and that lasted millions of years at least. Certainly conditions that lots of Earth-bound life would find it quite easy to live in. And that provides the tantalizing hope that perhaps some form of life arose on Mars and survived for a time and perhaps lives still in some sheltered underground areas. It&#x27;s not evidence or proof of life, it&#x27;s the hint of a possibility. But again, that&#x27;s the way science works. You narrow down possibilities and provide hints for further investigations.",1370713285

Private keys are not registered with CAs; rather, public keys are submitted to get signed.<p>While the CA system majorly sucks, and needs to be fixed, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the answer to mass surveillance, at least in the US.  Even if the NSA could sign any certificate they wanted, it seems extremely difficult to pull off active MitM attacks for every connection across the entire Internet.

So it is very legit to say, I&#x27;m running a number of hosts since my memory requirements are high, let&#x27;s try a cheaper on disk solution.<p>However that said it is also true that memory starts to be <i>seriously</i> cheap, and the real limit may be to run stuff on EC2 or similar platforms.<p>So sometimes the cost of RAM is a virtual cost associated with the platform you are running your services in, compared to the actual cost of that amount of memory.",1370713130

We believe important things get lost in our email, on our devices, and across multiple cloud-apps, and this makes working and being organized harder than it should be.
Seer is building the new way to work--a web-application that brings email, desktop, and cloud-apps into one place that applies algorithms to organize people&#x27;s data automatically and displays in an easy to use interface accessible from their browser, smartphone, or desktop.
This requires overcoming significant technical challenges, and we are seeking other engineers unfazed by difficult technical problems.
We are a small, early stage start-up that moves quickly. We were joined forces in October, funded by DreamIt Ventures, a top ranked national accelerator in November, built our MVP in 60 days, and demonstrated it at SxSw in March.
Our next move is recruit a team dedicated to making Seer a success, launch our web-app publicly this summer, and win the Evernote Developers challenge in September.
We are looking for someone to excited to turn data into understandable insights, and we think should have the skills below.
Required Skills: 
 Functional Programming (Scala, Clojure, Haskell, Erlang, etc..) 
 Rest API&#x27;s (to get data from the DB) 
 Unit Testing
Desire to Learn (if you don&#x27;t already have experience in them): 
 Scala (our primary language) 
 Data mining (we have several GB of metadata per user) 
 Natural Language Processing (deep processing of emails and documents) 
 Machine Learning (pioneer innovative ways to correlate user data) 
 NoSQL (Cassandra, Neo4j, etc)
Relevant Tools: 
 Git 
 SBT 
 Amazon Web Services

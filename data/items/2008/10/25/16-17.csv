The global superorganism exists already as the interconnection of all ecosystems on Earth, which includes both living systems and the long, slow cycles of minerals from oceans to land and atmosphere and back. Check the books from Dorion Sagan and Lynn Margulis, and from James Lovelock, on the subject.",1224953869
343648,comment,342705,342705,0,0,AlexeyMK,,,"Interesting idea.   How are you going to keep signal vs noise ratios worthwhile for Journalists?<p>If I'm launching a start-up and want to have to send out a press release, I need to either hire a PR agency or find a list of people I should email, which means I am at least minimally competent.  If I understand correctly, on IvyLees, I could just sign-up and issue a press release into my industry.  Assuming the site becomes popular, won't Journalists be more interested in the companies that are capable of reaching out to them 'the hard way' rather than issue a massive press release?",1224953496

Each individual part wants to survive, and so the entire thing survives. But there is real communication between the parts of the organism, so it's very basic.",1224953473

It's just that the words Seth chooses to represent these ideas kind of suck. What Seth calls an ideavirus is the same thing that Dawkins calls a meme, and that's a word we pretty much use every day. I wouldn't be surprised if at some point in the future someone else coined a word that meant the same thing as sheep walking, but was actually usable without sounding daft.",1224952569

It was pretty common for companies upgrading from earlier versions of Windows to buy the rock-bottom cheapest systems capable of running XP, much less Vista. Upgrading to Vista would mean replacing every computer in the office, on top Microsoft's bill. Why do that if there's nothing fundamentally unsatisfying with XP?",1224952323

343623,comment,343556,343556,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Skimming the article, it is sounding a little bit like ""intelligent design"", when it talks of ""programming"" humans.<p>In a sense, natural selection programs all organisms by allowing only the fit variations in a given generation to survive, promulgating the ""fit genes"" forward, but ""design"" or ""program"" are terms in this context to be used metaphorically. Natural Selection is itself an alogirthm:\nVariation + Selection + Inheritance = Evolution of new forms of life. So in this sense it is a ""program"" but only as a metaphor.<p>I have neither the time nor the patience to argue with an intelligent design advocate, anymore than I would spend time arguing with a flat earth advocate.",1224951381

343620,comment,342374,342374,0,0,etal,,,"Given where the NSF's funding is <i>actually</i> going, I chalk these statements up to a backlash against the trend of more people doing small amounts of programming as part of their ""real"" work. Scientists tend to view programming as more of a chore than an art, but it's still essential to getting real, relevant work done.<p>It's clear to any of these researchers that a program just amplifies your own efforts. From a distance, it may appear that an academic rival is letting the computer do all the thinking. That just wouldn't be fair, would it? If the computer can't think, isn't it better to just publish great thoughts in raw form, and let some benighted industry worker do the calculations and data entry?<p>Obviously, no. Thinking programmatically is different, and allows a researcher to answer new problems -- in any field. Even psychologists and sociologists crunch statistics on population groups: collecting and encoding data is tedious and time-consuming. Traditionally, surveys are filled out and crunched by hand; but looking at the massive amount of data available on social networks, for example, just crawling and aggregating that data could yield much better information than manually roping in 130 undergrads at your own school. Or you could splash a task out on Mechanical Turk to analyze the Turkers themselves. This would be big, and it would upset a lot of academics who built their reputations on traditional methods, and perhaps blew off computational research as a fad a decade or two ago.",1224951332

343613,comment,343594,343594,0,0,drcode,,,"The reason Clojure is successful right now IMHO is because:<p><pre><code>    1. It isn't afraid to revisit the basic design tenets of Common Lisp and Scheme\n    2. It has reasonably useful libraries (both through the JVM and written in native Clojure)\n</code></pre>\nNo other Lisp dialect has done this recently. My point is that its success doesn't have much to do, from what I can tell, with the actual design of the language. Clojure does fix annoyances in CL and Scheme (low hanging fruit) but I personally still prefer other modern dialects, like arc, in terms of basic language design.<p>The reason arc is crashing and burning right now is that it doesn't address #2 at all. Plus, arc is suffering from an absentee benevolent dictator.",1224950933

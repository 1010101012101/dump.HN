8296,comment,8145,8204,0,0,blakeross,,,"We're not referring to those platforms, actually. Neither has much to do with the core problems we're tackling, such as that people currently have to shuffle data between desktop and Web apps. Apollo <i>sounds</i> very similar, but it mostly solves the developer problem of ""I have Web skills but want to create a desktop app."" The additional UI affordances aside, it's still unclear to me how Apollo apps are worlds better than regular web apps from a user's perspective.<p>We were actually referring to some smaller companies that have announced or launched recently, such as Slingshot.<p>To be clear, I don't think the issue is having <i>more</i> apps, but having <i>great</i> apps. In our experience, luring users who can then lure developers is the best way to break the chicken-and-egg problem that any new platform faces. We also believe that building the apps and the platform concurrently yields a better platform.",1175543688

Calling it Bust 2.0 is pretty ridiculous. Those ""tips"" would apply to any situation period. Web or tech startups and the risks associated are nothing new and they'll continue to exist post two-point-oh era. <p>Our current growth can be attributed to a lot of excitement from everybody, and we can expect the momentum to ease up a little bit. Saying that it's a bust, bubble burst, or crash is just a plea for attention. The go-IPO-with-no-business craze does not exist this time around. A lot of the big sites are actually profitable and the smaller sites have acquisition as exit strategies. And the unsuccessful VC-backed companies just fade from existence. Nothing new there.",1175543464

And given the sorry state of patents today, some rather obvious things might be.<p>Second, although I have published research papers, I do not have any patents. I don't know what the typical patent is like nor how it would compare to the technical contributions of a research paper. <p>Third, my service is currently an early prototype and it is hard to see what sort of patents might be applicable at this early stage.<p>Any advice? What did you write for this question?",1175543463

Just curious how this site can bring anything unique to the already full YouTube table. There seems to be a lot of video posting/hosting sites that think success can be had by claiming support for a niche market when there is really little new functionality there to truly differentiate. <p>Best of luck to them though. The basic idea is great for the group here.",1175542135

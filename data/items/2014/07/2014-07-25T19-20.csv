Why, then, can a company move a small and inconsequential part of itself to a different jurisdiction, then be taxed under that other jurisdiction?<p>Companies moving out entirely would be analogous to people moving.  Companies moving out on paper while continuing to do business in the same location is analogous to tax evasion.",1406318398

When listening to investment advice, perhaps we should listen to people that made their fortunes through smart investing.

8087308,comment,8087159,8087159,2,0,byoung2,,,"I had a few ad and affiliate sites that made a fair amount of money at their peak, and then died after Google algorithm changes.  TechSpyer.com was just a WordPress site that took an XML feed from Commission Junction and Linkshare and created posts with affiliate links for consumer electronics products.  It took about an hour to make (it used a free WordPress theme and a custom XML to post plugin that I wrote).  It made about $150 per month back in 2007 before I sold it for $1500 on Flippa. I later made a similar site for general products called DealSpyer.com that made about $100/month before traffic dried up.  I had a travel site called RewardFreak.com that had pages for all the travel loyalty programs, and affiliate links to travel portals to book flights, hotels, cars, sign up for a rewards credit card, etc.  There were thousands of pages of content, but 99% of the traffic came from 5 pages (for lesser known frequent flyer programs, I ranked higher than the actual websites).  Just 1 or 2 affiliate sale per month was enough for $200+ revenue.<p>In total, I averaged about $500 a month during 2007-2010 with costs under $20/month, but 2011 the traffic on these sites disappeared overnight with the Panda update, so I just let the domains expire.",1406318351

By using &quot;diversity&quot; as a catch all for feel goodiness, is a little bit self serving and even selfish in the grand scheme of things. If we are going to do the work then do it, don&#x27;t do a bunch of marketing. If we want to look at CS and look at the harshest affected group it specifically black males (which no one is doing in all of these reports they are releasing) - it irks me because it seems that the world has moved on from black males needing help and it is more en vogue in 2014 to focus efforts on women and LGBT entirely and exclusively. A more well rounded approach is needed and that can&#x27;t begin until we are comfortable with admitting that the job isn&#x27;t done in regards to young black males, and yet the sentiment seems to be &quot;we&#x27;ve done enough for that underrepresented group&quot;<p>Solutions? tech companies and incubators need to be targeting young black males for immersion and mentoring programs as early as 5th grade.

8087294,comment,8087132,8087132,5,0,evv,,,"> When I create an API, web or otherwise, it is rarely of the type popularised by Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC and most other MVC frameworks. These tend to think of an API as simple resources with HTTP methods – two GETs, a POST, a PUT and a DELETE. That’s not an API. That’s just a basic Data Access Layer over HTTP. Sure, I’ve written code where that is a valid pattern for certain resources, but it’s not an API. An API provides high-level commands and operations, such as “activate this user” or “complete this order”.<p>I disagree. A resource-centric &quot;restful&quot; http interface is most certianaly an API. These high level commands can be easily expressed with a PUT request on the user to activate, or a PUT on the order resource to complete it.<p>In theory, we could always go back to the days of JSON RPC where every request is a POST to /api.json with { action: &#x27;getUser&#x27;, userId: 123 }. IMO, the rails-esque API conventions are a significant improvement.<p>Is there an alternative routing technique which you prefer? I wouldn&#x27;t know, but maybe the .NET ecosystem has a library for creating APIs with proper conventions for classes, objects, and methods.",1406318209

Reason being, if you should happen to encounter an event that triggers a buyout right of one of your members/shareholders/partners, you want a contractually accepted valuation to control the cost of the buyout. Well planned valuation procedures can really help avoid costly litigation over the value of an ownership interest.<p>Appraisers can value your company above a billion dollars without you ever taking on an outside investor. If someone does go to invest, they&#x27;re going to hire their own appraiser (or entire firm of economists) to determine how much your company is worth prior to investing.<p>Appraisals aren&#x27;t free, but they have significant long term benefits. Their estimate of your company value tends to be as accurate as any potential investor&#x27;s estimate (competing biases on other sides of the ideal valuation).",1406318099

Nobody owes you a spoon-fed version of reality on your terms when they make their own decisions.<p>What is unreasonable is saying that normal business decision practices are not adequate to make this particular decision, and instead a formal, &quot;unbiased&quot; study must be conducted.<p>The numbers are so extreme that they speak for themselves. Several years of 0% women founders, and now 10%.<p>There&#x27;s a double standard for evidence when it comes to sexism (and other cultural issues). Maybe it&#x27;s because some people take it as a personal affront, as if they&#x27;re accepting responsibility for the actions of others, and it switches into &quot;prove beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; mode rather than &quot;what&#x27;s the most likely reality here.&quot;<p>Recently there was a string of articles on Language Log about gender disparities in meetings between men interrupting women and women interrupting men during discussion. A surprisingly large number of comments consisted of men denying the evidence. This type of response is endemic wherever science touches cultural issues. An unbiased scientific study of gender disparity may be useful as a tool for finding where to make corrective steps, but it will convince nearly no one. On issues like this, people stick to their cultural inclinations more than the evidence.<p>HN has decided to move the conversation forward, and I give them kudos for that.",1406317996

Unless we want to say that the line dictating illegal tax avoidance is whatever the Supreme Court happens to say it is that year based on their own personal moral fiber.<p>From what I&#x27;m reading of that decision; it wasn&#x27;t made because the transaction was deemed a somehow &quot;immoral&quot; abuse of the law to avoid taxes, but because the reorganization wasn&#x27;t valid under the relevant statute. Conducting the reorganization solely for reducing tax liabilities is apparently not a valid reason for the reorganization under the statute. Someone could attempt the same reorganization for reasons other than reducing tax liabilities and it would still not be valid, under the same statute, if it did not meet the requirements.<p>I feel the quotes are fine within the apparent intent of the original thought, that hating a company because it does logical things that some feel are immoral makes little sense.

8087120,comment,8086502,8086502,2,0,daiidgo,,,"The short answer is no. The long answer is -- wait for it -- it depends. Sorry to have to give such a useless answer.<p>When investors or competitors are looking at your company and deciding whether they want part or all of what you have, they are going to put together a comprehensive analysis of the value of your company. Meaning, they are going to try and identify each and every asset you hold (physical property, intellectual property, key employees, and company goodwill) and decide what your company is worth. Then they are going to put together an estimate of what your company will be worth in the future.<p>If your business model includes the use or production of open-source software, then the value of your intellectual property (software copyrights and patents specifically) will probably be lower than if your business was developing/selling proprietary software. Thus, if your business&#x27;s biggest asset is the software you develop, then your companies value is probably lower by producing software that doesn&#x27;t produce licensing fees. But potential investors are still going to look at the value of other assets such as whatever key employees you might have on your team. Currently, most business&#x27;s greatest single asset is their brand (Google is currently biggest with some $150 billion valuation).<p>To address your hypothetical, if Dropbox&#x27;s client were open source then anyone could put together a client of their own to use with Dropbox. We&#x27;ll assume that Dropbox would still produce their own client and charge the same amount for each tier of service. So the question then becomes, does the existence of alternative clients devalue the Dropbox brand, reduce the number of paying users, or allow competitors to poach users that would otherwise choose Dropbox?<p>In the case of Dropbox I think we can safely assume that the answer to all three questions is an emphatic &#x27;no&#x27;. First, Dropbox has plenty of competitors that offer nearly identical products that they developed without the help of the Dropbox client: Google Drive, Apple iCloud, and Microsoft Office 365 to name a few of the bigger ones. An open source client wouldn&#x27;t have had any effect on the competitiveness of the market. Second, the number of paying users would probably remain the same whether they were using a proprietary client or an open source client, because Dropbox is really charging for a service rather than software license.<p>Finally, we look at the effect on the Dropbox brand. It is possible, though I would argue unlikely, that if Dropbox allowed developers to freely put together their own clients for use with the Dropbox service that those unlicensed clones would diminish the Dropbox brand value. I think this is an unlikely result because I think that the vast majority of users would stick with the official Dropbox client and ignore the clones. Geeky power users might want to play around with customizable alternatives but they are a tiny niche market. Like most successful products, Dropbox&#x27;s revenue is driven by average, non-tech-savvy people who just want a simple product that works.<p>Dropbox&#x27;s potential is driven by the companies recognizable name, the product&#x27;s ease of use, and the reputation that the company has built as being reliable and trustworthy. The product itself was never very innovative.<p>Companies who are developing highly specialized software, or patent-heavy products stand to lose a lot more value by going open source.<p>If you want to give some specifics about your company I would be more than happy to discuss how you might avoid losing value by going open source.",1406316339

One crucial perspective that the OSS shares with D&I is that <i>both view discrimination as an impediment to progress</i>. OSS licenses include several non-discrimination clauses (economic, field of endeavor, other restrictions).

You should not train for your first marathon the way other people trained for their <i>first</i> one, because many people don&#x27;t necessarily do it right the first time, and it is not necessary to repeat that!<p>Stick to the standard formula. Follow a weekly schedule which includes: a long run which builds to about about 20 miles, and a tempo run of 6 to 10 miles (can start at 4 until you get used to it). The rest is easy running. A weekly mileage of around 50 is adequate. It may sound like a lot, but it isn&#x27;t. The 20 mile long run eats up 40% of it right there, and the tempo run whittles it down to 20 miles, which can be covered in three runs of 8, 8 and 4. And that leaves two days of rest per week.<p>Those looking to run a fast marathon should do some interval training, but that is advanced and not recommended for the first marathon, unless you have a fierce, competitive spirit that can&#x27;t be held back. Interval training for marathon involves long repeats of 800 to 1200 meter long repeats. I believe that even shorter ones of 400 meters can still be useful. They improve the quality of the longer repeats, and the longer repeats in turn improve the quality of the weekly tempo run: a kind of trickle down effect. You probably don&#x27;t want to be doing 100 meter sprints or heavy squats in the gym.<p>Here is a tip: use treadmills to your advantage. Don&#x27;t do too much running on treadmills, but put in some treadmill mileage. Here is why: treadmills quite precisely control pace, much more accurately than the newbie runner (plus other conditions are under control too). From time to time, put in a good 8 mile steady run on a treadmill, at the same pace from beginning to end. Try to get your body to memorize how differently that pace feels at the beginning, middle and end.  Always remember to set a treadmill to 1% incline, to approximately compensate for the lack of headwind, or you will get a grossly wrong sense of effort for a given pace.",1406316026

No more flexibility for the government to encourage capital purchases or otherwise use tax policy as a policy driver.<p>It would also decrease the incentive to invest in their own company because the cost of building a new factory or raising workers&#x27; wages or hiring more workers would actually increase. Think about it, if a company were considering giving all of its workers a $5,000 raise. In a world with a 30% marginal corporate tax rate, the actual cost to your company&#x27;s bottom line of such a raise would be $3,500/worker, because you only pay tax on net income. But with a 0% tax rate, the cost would be $5,000/worker, that&#x27;s a 43% bigger cost. Plus, presuming that personal income taxes would need to be raised by ~11% to make up for the loss of corporate income taxes, the workers are going to end up a lot less likely to get substantial raises.<p>The benefits of eliminating the corporate income tax are going to have to be huge to make up for the disincentives it would create.",1406315842

The prizes in Literature are typically awarded to recognize a cumulative lifetime body of work rather than a single achievement. In this case the notion of ""lag"" does not directly apply. The prizes in Peace, on the other hand, are often awarded within a few years of the events they recognize. For instance, Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations.""<p>So, maybe this is a case of prescience or something ?<p>I really think this was dreadfully misguided and that it devalues the whole of the Nobel Prize, of course there is absolutely no way they could ever do anything about it now but the Nobel Prize is now synonymous with 'has the potential to do great things, some day.

Please inform the media.<p>From the wikipedia article on the 'war' in Afghanistan:<p>""The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) did not authorize the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom). There is some debate as to whether UNSC authorization was required, centered around the question of whether the invasion was an act of collective self-defense provided for under Article 51 of the UN Charter, or an act of aggression.[42]<p>The U.S. Administration did not declare war, and labeled Taliban troops and supporters terrorists rather than soldiers, denying them the protections of the Geneva Convention and due process of law. This position has been successfully challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court[43] and questioned even by military lawyers responsible for prosecuting affected prisoners""<p>And:<p><a href=""http://www.hrw.org/en/node/79295"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hrw.org/en/node/79295</a><p>So, to call it war is not clear cut.

Some of the practices that the advocates are evolutionary delivery, designing for change, and timebox development. These are the same practices that appear to be what some here believe are what is called agile.<p>As far as I know, the term agile really only became associated with software development in 2001 because of the agile manifesto. Because the manifesto itself is the origin and source for the whole agile movement it seems logical to me that it should be taken as the defining basis for what it means to be agile.<p>To me, agile doesn't mean the same thing as good - therefore I don't feel like I need to some how remake agile in my image. I am reasonably comfortable being closer to being a duct-tape programmer than I am to being an agileista.<p>Allowing the leaders of the agile movement to define what agile is, doesn't have to mean that you agree with everything, or even anything they are saying or doing.

Second, e-mailing you was far from my first reaction.  My first reaction was to flame you back in this thread.

Please inform the media.<p>>>So either they're civilians that have been arrested for crimes or they're prisoners of war.<p>But I just did a Devil's Advocate argument that the prisoners aren't treated worse than normal US' prisoners (which is horrible, but still much better than most any 3rd world prison system).<p>I thought the Red Cross had access to Guantanamo?<p>Edit: Grammar, sigh.<p>Edit: Historically, all countries I know of with terror problems (USA, Germany, Israel, Italy, Great Britain, etc) has played loose with human rights interpretations. I don't see a reason to judge the US harsher than others.",1255086613

871089,comment,870921,870954,0,0,jeromec,,,"The predominant sentiment here seems to be Obama is a bad guy. I'm not saying he deserves the peace prize, but he didn't ask for it, nor, I'm sure, do anything he has done in pursuit of it. He didn't ""push a catchy slogan of change"" to get elected, at least, not the way you portray it. He adopted his ""change"" mantra from his earliest days as a politician, actually as a community group organizer. He sympathized with the disconnect he saw with poverty stricken blacks in Chicago contrasted with the wealth, indifference, and apparent self-interest of high level American politics. That's why he has repeatedly reminded fellow politicians of a duty to actually serve the people, and done things like put limits on staff salaries. The ""change"" message was coincidentally on time, and took on new meaning in light of Bush's performance, but not something he cooked up at the last minute.<p>Edit: for those voting me down would you please delineate which of my points you disagree with? I'm genuinely curious.",1255086376

Compare the buttons under layer palettes. GIMP has 32px icons, while Photoshop has over 10px smaller ones. Or the slider, in Photoshop under ""Navigator"" and in GIMP in the Layers palette. Actually just compare Layers palettes in each. GIMP uses lots of superfluous labels and huge font size compared to Photoshop In my screenshot Photoshop also has 2 more palettes on screen.<p>Photoshops UI is also quite flexible, allowing to move and resize palettes freely, dock and undock, and group palettes to tab-groups. And layouts can be saved and then selected with just few mouse clicks. This allows it to scale across monitor size and count relatively easily.<p>edit: Sorry for inflammatory Photoshop vs. GIMP post",1255086161

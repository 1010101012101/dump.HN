The Wikimedia Foundation are trying to create a variety of tools for new page patrollers (I used to do it) to aid them in better handling the flow of new articles coming in (it's called the ""zoom interface"").<p>Another thing that is being tested is making the automatic templates used to notify people that articles are up for deletion or whatever a lot more friendly. For the last month or so, the Foundation and the community have been working together to A-B test better warning templates.<p>As for discussion threads, there's LiquidThreads, which has been in development for a while but would provide a threaded discussion system sort of like what Reddit and HN have but for Wikimedia talk pages, but still keeping the flexibility of being able to refactor discussions and move stuff about without an admin. LiquidThreads is in use on English Wikinews and on mediawiki.org, but English Wikipedia doesn't have it because it isn't quite mature enough yet (or something, I haven't kept track).<p>Finally, there's the big one: the visual editor. That's in development at the moment, hopefully with testing starting by the end of the year. This is going to be an opt-out WYSIWYG-style editor.

So I went and found a book that I could use as a blueprint for how to get along with people.<p>I used ""How to Win Friends and Influence People.""<p>These days it's terribly dated, but I picked up one of my copies the other day and dipped into it.  Allowing for the language and the scenarios used, it seemed like it would be as effective today as it was for me some 35 years ago.<p>But you can't just read it, you have to study, reflect, and apply what you've just read.  The book itself says that, exhorting you to read a chapter, then put it into deliberate practice.<p>It may not work for you, but I can pretty much guarantee that the one thing that won't work is not making the effort.<p>ADDED IN EDIT: I should add that there are people who hate me, and others that I get along with <i>really</i> well.

I'm just arguing that, at the beginning, each had a partner to help get things started. Woz created the Apple 1 and 2 which brought incredible financial success to Apple allowing Jobs to later start Next and purchase Pixar from Lucas. Paul Allen was instrumental Microsoft's early days including coding Microsoft Basic and making deals. Gates had the chance to then operate from a strong position to grow Microsoft and lock in that monopoly. Warren Buffett has always said that he didn't create Bershire alone and that Charlie Munger (as well as Benjamin Graham) helped immensely.<p>I am currently a single founder and I disagree with the idea that you must have a co-founder to be successful.

You don't get depth perception, and there are artifacts of recording in video and audio (even in modern HD shows) that make a real-life scene distinctly different. I don't know scientifically how that's important, I just know there's a difference. You know there's a difference if you ever see someone on TV and then see them in real life for the first time.<p>A remote doesn't explore causality inside the media, it's only exploring ""when I press a certain button it will switch to a different show which is not of my choosing and which I can't predict"". They might correllate pressing the same numbers with the same show at the same time of the day. The ""camera angle"" interactivity in live theater doesn't get into causality at all, just different ways you can look at or listen to a scene, but in videogames causality is rarely so random.<p>Think of it at a very basic, I-don't-know-what-TV-or-videogames-are level: I press the channel up button on the remote, the image suddenly changes to something entirely different. If I do this a few hours later, the former image and the latter image are entirely different from before. Let's even assume I'm watching Netflix and I've figured out how to navigate menus: the menu is interactive, but the media I'm watching doesn't give me any control over what's happening inside the media. In a videogame, if I press a button a character will move, a gun will shoot, a menu will open. If I do the same thing a few hours from now, the same thing will happen. A different thing might happen in a predictable context: if my dude is in front of a wall he might climb the wall rather than jump when I press A, it's generally bad design to allow otherwise. The link between cause and effect is much more clear, and my role as an agent of cause is much more clear as well.",1319031441

The way to prove that it works is to simply succeed. As a single founder myself I've been there, I've done the multiple-founder thing too (with mixed success). There are no guarantees, to pretend either way is a shoe-in is nonsense. But statistically speaking, and looking at things from the point of view of a guy or girl considering going it alone or from the point of view of an investor that has the choice to invest in a company founded by one or more people the statistics seem to point to more being the better choice. Exceptions will always happen. But the ones that you point to are not those exceptions.<p>We can't know anything about pasts and futures that didn't happen, but we can safely say that things that did happen and that were likely significant were at least as significant as anything that you think would have happened otherwise. Jobs, Wozniak, Gates and Allen would probably never have said what you just said, and that alone marks them as potentially more successful. How you interact with others is an important factor in your chances for success, and being able to give credit where credit is due is another.<p>I agree that you and I should not be involved in any business because we'd probably fight, and you are making that point very eloquently.",1319030761

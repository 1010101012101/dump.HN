Redis builds on say, Solaris, with no problem because the project is written in C and it is trivial to add the needed calls. A KV store written in Go can't support Solaris because Go itself would need to support Solaris first.<p>Years of tooling centered around C (e.g., autoconf/automake) is what makes most C programs cross-platform out of the box with little or no OS-specific code if you are sticking to POSIX. Until the same ecosystem develops around any new language, authors realize that choice of language alone can immediately limit their cross-platform capabilities.",1332338287

3734384,comment,3733979,3733979,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>Stop equating bad code with bad developers. Stop equating code criticisms as a knock against you as a person.</i><p>To me, what I find jarring is how common bad code is and how incredibly rare well-designed systems and good code are. It seems obvious that the causes of bad code are numerous (only one of which is unskilled developers) and the conditions that allow good software to be created are very rare. You have a lot of ""goldie-locks"" variables that ruin everything if out of a narrow range. One of these is time pressure. If there are tight, rigid deadlines the code will turn bad, but if there's no sense of time pressure at all the code will usually rot in a different way (becoming increasingly ""clever"" and impractical after the project is essentially finished but no one wants to admit that).<p>I've come to the conclusion, over the years, that getting mad at people for ""writing bad code"" is both useless and wrong, because (1) you really don't know what conditions caused the code to become bad, and (2) it means you make an enemy of the one person who can help you out. I've generally come to view standing code-quality problems (and the lack of budgeted time and resources to fix them) as a managerial fault.",1332338192

Neither Twilio nor Stripe are in the same business line as RollCallMe and thus are offering services, and thus not competing, therefore they have an incentive to keep prices down in order to attract more customers. I cannot speak for Stripe, but Twilio has lowered their rates in the past and does a wonderful job in regards to both technology and customer service.<p>Yes, there are no technical barriers to entry into this one-service industry, aside from knowing a Rails person who can wire up the app, but time-to-market, initial pricing and the potential for add-ons that can engage more users and augment the revenue streams give them the advantage. Choosing Twilio gives them that advantage.<p>Not a rock-solid app by any means, but one that's needed and doesn't compete directly against more mature and properly funded platforms.<p>Great idea.

3734300,comment,3729761,3730889,3,0,YmMot,,,"I'm also not a fan. As a piece of juvenile science fiction I think it's <i>serviceable</i> though if I had children I'd probably prefer they skip it.<p>To start with, the story is predicated on the notion that Eugenics <i>works</i>, or as the saying goes; if it's not outright saying it, it's sure implying it loudly. It's reasonable to say that two intelligent people will probably have intelligent kids, but the novel goes way past that. The three children are <i>freakishly</i> (in the novel's terms, this is another one of my gripes I'll get to) intelligent.<p>It's not something that could be accomplished without an extremely long and large breeding program, if at all. (also note, you'd be producing an awful lot of pretty freaking smart kids, see my next point) It would mostly be a matter of luck and at that point why have a breeding program at all? Therefore the intelligence of the children is strongly implied to be a result of the breeding program.<p>In terms of artistic objections, the ""freakish intelligence"" of the children is accomplished by making most of the other characters in the novel cardboard cutouts or strawmen that Ender can just knock over or tear apart easily. What happened to all the other kids from the breeding program? Surely it produced a bunch of ""90% Enders"" who are almost as good. It comes off as contrived and inauthentic.<p>The whole ""child soldier"" angle is ridiculous as well. Child soldiers are used in conflicts because they are easily manipulated and readily available but that is not always desirable. A rebel fighter in Africa only needs someone who can hold and point a machine gun to replace the last guy who was doing it. The needs of the military in Ender's Game are quite a bit more sophisticated.<p>Children are also ignorant and dumb. Innate intelligence can only take you so far, it gives you a large ""gas tank"" but you still need to fill it with gas.<p>Military Strategy is not necessarily a terribly intelligence-taxing thing. It's mostly a question of learning from the past, taking into account current technology, and trying to anticipate other attacks. If they really wanted to win the war they'd put an experienced General in charge of strategy and have Ender start working on the next great super-weapon, that's what makes decisive victories.<p>The whole ""the enemy's gate is down"" thing is a good example of how Ender is not smart, everyone else is dumb and also how the book has a flawed view of military strategy. The ""the enemy's gate is down"" is a lesson <i>we</i> learned hundreds of years ago at the latest (i.e. the transition from neatly lined up soldiers standing in rows across from each-other firring muskets to modern trench and guerrilla warfare). Is this some bizarre future where we've forgotten all the basic lessons of military history for the past thousand years? Or is this just the <i>worst</i> military academy ever?<p>Going back to Eugenics, the book's plot <i>requires</i> that Ender is so intelligent that it's more efficient/effective to try and train him up to a brilliant strategist than to just use one of the existing ones. I don't find that realistic.<p>I also don't buy the whole ""He's a kid so he'll look at it from a fresh angle"" aspect. Sure kids do tend to be a bit open minded but I find it dubious that they would naturally have the right kind of open mindedness for this application, that is an <i>informed</i> one.<p>I don't care how new the MD Device is, we're to believe that they have no idea how it works? Not even a guess as to what would happen if you fired it at a planet? Come on... nobody said ""let's shoot it at an asteroid or something""? When nuclear weapons were developed pretty much right away nuclear scientists stood around like excited schoolgirls with a puppy coming up with all the super neato places they could set off an A-bomb to see what happens (Underwater! Space! ""uninhabited"" islands!)<p>Honestly I could go on and on about all the things I dislike about this book. I realize I might seem a bit worked up, but really it just slightly annoys me that such a mediocre book is so popular. It owes it's popularity mostly to the fact that it's a classic underdog story. A lonely nerdy kid who's smarter than everyone around him kicks ass and chews bubblegum, it's a young sci-fi nerd's wet dream. I know when I was in middle school during tough times I would occasionally spend time daydreaming elaborate revenge fantasies where I showed everyone up, so to a kid like that Ender's Game is very validating. That's good in some ways but I also worry that it can be unhealthy because I think while that sort of mentality is natural is something that needs to be overcome and not indulged.<p>Overall I find parts of it unwholesome and overall offensive aesthetically.",1332337167
3734299,comment,3733825,3734042,9,0,hythloday,,,"Here are some other things that have been considered abominations at one point or another by a dominant culture: homosexual sex; Jews marrying Germans; property right and suffrage for women; atheism (or virtually every religion, in fact).<p>I am pretty sure that people who held the view that those things were abominable were not Dr. Evil caricatures, but honest people who sincerely believed that these things were utterly wrong and no-one should speak in support of them. I don't say this to illustrate that I think slavery is the moral equivalent of atheism, but that I don't believe that I am smart enough to forgo all my cultural baggage and assert that I have a privileged insight into what is ""truly"" abominable and what was just bad stuff other people believe.<p>Even if you do choose to assert that, I think that slavery is an interesting choice because there <i>are</i> arguments that can be made for it. Athenian democracy was essentially built on the backs of disenfranchised slaves; the lack of technological sophistication of Ancient Greece wouldn't have permitted enough free time to nurture a rule by the people without it. Is the world better off for Athenian democracy, slavery and all? I don't think you can answer that with a pat yes or no, but that's the whole point, it's a complex question, not a ""slavery is bad, fire everyone who thinks otherwise"" question.<p>Libertarians would question whether the state ought to have the power to ban certain kinds of life-long contract between consenting adults. If you want to stretch the definition of slavery, the standard of living in the West is only supportable by labourers working in other parts of the world under authoritarian systems they don't have political power to change. Is that bad? Sure! Is it a very similar situation to the Industrial Revolution of the 18th/19th centuries, which is essentially the underpinning for every single employment right we have? Yes, it is. Are we then doing good by supporting slavery? I don't know, but again, I don't think these questions should be shut down without discussion.<p>I don't mean here to speak directly in support of some of the very hateful opinions that you can see expressed every day--I think most of them are vile and I wish their holders didn't do so (and I pity them for the emotional turmoil that must have engendered them and that they engender). But the solution is never to ban or restrict speech, legally or socially, even when a majority agrees that it's desirable to do so, because <i>we are not smarter than everyone else who will ever live</i>.",1332337163

It is never about being the smartest person because at some point even the smartest person will be replaced. I've learned to accept criticism by realizing that it's not about where I am now but where I am going. As long as I can look back on code I've written in the past and think to myself that I could do better now then I feel I'm headed in the right direction. Criticism then becomes a tool to keep me on course and I am grateful to receive it.<p>(But only if it comes from someone genuine of course... ignoramus' are an unfortunate reality we all have to learn to cope with).<p>It can be hard to learn to accept criticism of our code. So much emphasis is put on being the smartest or the brightest person. All too often I hear people at start-ups and companies say things like, ""We only hire the best people."" (To which I smile and wish them luck). A lot of effort is put into evaluating code in order to determine the worth of a programmer so I hardly find it surprising that it is common to conflate code with intelligence (or random computer science trivia for that matter).<p>I really appreciate articles like this. I think people should be a little more bold and creative when they sit down to write a program. It doesn't hurt to be impractical once in a while. Or absurd, witty, or whimsical. It should be something to be enjoyed, studied, and improved over time.<p>All that being said there is room for improvement in how we deliver criticism as well.

Neither you nor I, as far as I know.<p>You said I gave ""dangerous medical mis-advice"" and someone, who I assumed was you, flagged my post.  Assuming you didn't think the suggestion of not drinking was dangerous, what could you have meant besides interpreting my post as an endorsement of cocaine use?  Either you keep changing what you're saying, or I've been misinterpreting each of your posts.  I'm legitimately confused now.<p>> I then reviewed your source and concluded, ""I don't think that what you've posted really supports your claim that the WHO finds recreational cocaine usage to be less hazardous than drinking enough to get drunk.""<p>I recall them explicitly making that claim, as I referenced in my original post.  Could the source I originally read have been a forgery and the Guardian made the same mistake?  Yes.  I don't think that's the case, but it could be.  But I've definitely come across in other sources (that I guess could have gotten their information from the same unofficial WHO document, but I think they were sources that had citations, so that shouldn't be the case) the same general conclusion that powder cocaine isn't nearly as harmful as alcohol or opiates unless you take large enough doses or do it enough to develop a dependency.",1332335959

From the standpoint of idealism, I think that the best way to go about ending inequality is to simply cease treating people unequally. We can't just go straight from here to there though, and I don't have good solutions. I suspect that it's the type of thing that phases itself out as cultural patterns live and die, and that's slow. The ramifications of that are a separate, stupidly large can-of-worms topic.<p><i>And people have the right to be offended or not offended.</i><p>I agree that people ""have the right"" to be offended or not offended. I mean, in case the above is indicative of me not expressing myself clearly, that people do not have the right to <i>suppress other people's expression of their opinions because of their offense</i>. And people are not obligated <i>to be sorry for offending somebody by having and expressing an opinion</i>.  And people do not have the right to <i>expect that no one will be offended by their opinion</i>. And people do not have the right to <i>only have opinions expressed to them which they do not find offensive</i>, assuming they are not in a ridiculously coercive situation, in which case the breach of right by the gun being held by their temple is probably of bigger concern than the offensive opinions being expressed to them forcibly. Outside of the context of extremist opinions, which are the majority of examples that get brought up in this type of discussion, there are way too many people for that to even be a feasible scenario.<p><i>A morally corrupt person has the right to hang out in the Hall of Evil if they would like.</i><p>As long as everyone in the ""Hall of Evil"" is consenting to hang out there, I don't think I could make a moral judgement about them. I could make one about myself, and how I would not feel morally ""right"" if I was doing what they were doing, but if they know what they're getting into and they're consenting to it, I could not call it morally corrupt. I know enough people that are legitimately into things that make me uncomfortable to think about participating in to not be able to hold another opinion while being intellectually honest with myself.<p><i>But the purpose of the original post being discussed is that there is a way to apologize, and for that matter a reason to apologize. I personally think the apology was warranted.</i><p>I agree. And I think the second apology they posted was much better. An apology here is absolutely warranted <i>because</i> they ended up making a whole bunch of people think that they were ignorant, or bigoted, or malicious in someway when they are (most likely) not, and did not intend to be so ridiculously insensitive to stuff they <i>knew about</i>. They made a stupid mistake, caused a bunch of people to be offended <i>where they did not intend to</i>, they're in the process of owning up for it, and that's good and will likely cause people to respect them a bit more.<p>If they posted that they thought ""women should stay in the kitchen"", and they really thought that, then the most honest apology they <i>could</i> make would be that they were sorry people got offended. I wouldn't agree with them,  I would actively show people reasons why their opinion should be ignored if they were campaigning for laws requiring ""women to stay in the kitchen"". If they realized later they had been publicly holding a pretty ridiculously offensive opinion for no good reason, I would expect they would be apologizing, probably for their ignorance, but mostly for actions and offending people. If they just held it, honestly thought it, expressed it, and offended somebody, I see no reason for apology, and don't see how any genuine apology, other than ""being sorry you're offended"" would be possible.<p>Do I think slavery is defensible as a moral opinion? No. I think that if someone does, they should be able to express that, and that if they hold that opinion out of ignorance or misunderstanding that that ignorance or misunderstanding can be addressed. I think that suppressing the <i>expression</i>, the <i>ability to express</i> an opinion, any opinion, because it's offensive or ""morally unsound"" is <i>dangerous</i>.  I don't think that many, if any, of the ""extremist"" opinions I've heard have enough weight that they should be considered so dangerous as to be banned.  Doing so does nothing to solve the problem of people holding those opinions when they do not know they should not be.<p>Slavery, by the way, is alive and well. A  number of people not only think it should exist, but <i>actively purchase humans</i>. A large part of minimizing or stopping that is making it so that when people who think that slavery ""is just how it is"" -- because they've been surrounded by it, or had ideas drilled into their heads as children, or grasped onto some fallacy they didn't identify -- are <i>capable</i> of being presented with information to the contrary in such a manner as to actually change their minds. This does happen. It does not happen when expression of opinion is suppressed.",1332335017

It's something that can be easily corrected, and is specific to the tech industry (and other male-dominated fields).<p>I reject the idea that the two issues can be conflated, that the very practice of objectification <i>is</i> what makes women feel unwelcome. (Correct me if I'm wrong?) My internal counterexample I'm using is how I'd feel if the flyer offered as a perk ""Men: Tired from your long hack-a-thon? Have our hot, muscled men bring you a refreshment or carry you to the lounge area to take a power nap."" It's human nature to enjoy attractive people, landscapes, art, etc, and I, as a man, don't feel worse off knowing that women might enjoy ogling attractive men.",1332335008

Some more polish would be appropriate, this looks very much like an early alpha, not a beta. At least don't let the errors,warnings and notices show directly on the (front!) page.<p>I mean: coming into your front page, and seeing three PHP notices displayed right off the bat, is a huge turnoff. Even if the service is actually wonderful, some users may be scared away by such first impression (""what else is broken?"").",1332334985

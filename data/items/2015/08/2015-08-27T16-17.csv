In the future it will probably be better for me as I won&#x27;t be doing template files with fiddly PHP tags, instead I will be json encoding the requested data, e.g. an array of products. There is a whole lot of logic to getting that array of products, this you need the server for. Presentation of that data? That can be done with the new stuff.

I&#x27;d say Aikido is the most proselytizing martial art out there. But they, like most martial arts, don&#x27;t have any actual sparring. BJJ gets away with it because you can spar without much, if any, risk of injury.<p>I think this is where a lot of the mentality comes from--being one of the few MA&#x27;s where theory and technique get tested regularly. If you&#x27;ve done any form of striking, you&#x27;d know how much different it is to practice against a bag than it is another human. Same goes for grappling.<p>> A little bit of modesty and camaraderie would go a long way here.<p>I think you&#x27;d see a lot of modesty and camaraderie if you went to a BJJ gym.<p>You have to remember that martial arts has a history of &quot;who&#x27;s better than who&quot;, which is what MMA grew out of. So of course there will be competition between various martial arts, as it simply comes down to marketing.<p>But a ton of BJJ folks train multiple martial arts. It&#x27;s incredibly common to see Muay Thai taught in the same gym, and these places don&#x27;t even market themselves as MMA.<p>(But yes, I agree--the chest puffing marketing doesn&#x27;t appeal to me either.)",1440694729

In the C code, it escapes as a returned NULL.  In C++/Java, it would be a thrown exception.  In Haskell, it&#x27;s the Maybe.<p>The Maybe is pretty close to isomorphic to a checked exception.  The caller either has to handle it, or to return a Maybe/declare that it throws an exception itself.  At some layer, you have to handle the Nothing/catch the exception.  The Nothing short-circuits part of the computation; so does the exception.  From where I sit, they&#x27;re playing almost exactly the same roles.

In addition to death, bicycle accidents can also cause varying degrees of physical and mental debilitation. One of the most important things to examine in the discussion of helmet use is the risk of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Helmets do help there, significantly [1].<p>From the cited article:<p>&quot;[...] One third of the cyclists who are admitted to hospital with serious injury after a traffic crash are
diagnosed with head/brain injury. Approximately three-quarters of these cyclists sustain this
head/brain injury in crashes not involving a motor vehicle. As many as nine out of ten young children
who sustain head/brain injury, do so in crashes not involving a motor vehicle. In the majority of cases
these are bicycle-only crashes.<p>Research has shown that a bicycle helmet provides protection against serious head and brain injury.
The most recent estimate (Elvik, 2011) indicates that the risk of head injuries is 1.72 times higher for
cyclists not wearing a helmet than it is for cyclists who do wear a helmet, with a 95% confidence
interval of 1.33-2.22. For brain injury the risk seems to be <i>2.13 times higher</i>, with a 95% confidence
interval of 1.33-3.45. [...]&quot;<p>There are many other studies, with the overwhelming majority pointing to helmets being significantly protective against TBIs:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=bicycle+helmet+traumatic+brain+injury"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=bicycle+helmet+trau...</a><p>If you&#x27;re going to be hit by a truck, there&#x27;s only so much you can do.

Currently there exists IP around many small DNA components (you can think of them as genes though this wouldnt be correct in all cases - more like DNA programs).<p>Currently in biology, if I want to build a composite part, that incorporates many separate parts, each with IP around them, I need to get a license for all of those parts.<p>The tech industry had a similar problem back in the &quot;golden age&quot; of computer parts development. It is often so expensive and difficult for any innovation to happen to happen under these circumstances, as so many patents and licenses and what not must be obtained, which typically frightens investors from putting cash in small startups. The tech industry has solved this with EDA tools - we need something similar in biotech.<p>What I&#x27;d call a DNA Part or cassette, techs call an &quot;IP&quot; or silicone block IP.  They have worked out a system where it appears the big design software houses act as brokers and clearing houses for their users. They aggregate not only the necessary licenses, but also the documentation and design rules for how to use a specific part. Then the design tool compiles all these parts down into something that is sent for synthesis by the foundry. They&#x27;re really light years ahead of the biotech industry on this.<p>I recommend this fascinating overview of how intellectual property rights in integrated circuit design have evolved.

Nowhere do I see mention that your information had to correspond to reality.<p>If I were to believe with great certainty that my wife is an alien breeding a cluster of biological weapons that will destroy all of humanity, and assuming that I want to prevent this from happening, reason would compel me to kill her. It would be a completely rational act.<p>People get this wrong because holding such beliefs is typical for crazy (= irrational) people. Because to _arrive_ at this belief, unless it was imposed on me through drugs, brain damage or brainwashing, would involve some major failures of reasoning at some _earlier_ point. I would have to e.g. believe that I was privy to information that the rest of the world didn&#x27;t have, which is a pretty unreasonable thing to believe, given what every adult knows about how the world works.<p>Less radical example: At some point in history, it was considered common knowledge that the world is flat, and seafaring too far in any given direction runs the risk of falling off the edge. So sailors were afraid to sail too far. Was this fear irrational? Not at all! Based on the best human knowledge at the time, people had good reason to be afraid. That fear would be irrational for a well-informed person of our time, sure, but only because we meanwhile have access to better information.<p>Hypothetical: Maybe there&#x27;s a meteor headed for Earth, due to destroy us all in a month. Let&#x27;s say for now that this is reality - but we don&#x27;t know it because NASA hasn&#x27;t seen this meteor yet. If rationality were based on absolute reality, then the rational thing for us to do would be to build spaceships or blow our life savings on drugs and hookers. But that&#x27;s silly, because we can only base the well-reasoned-ness of our actions on what we know. And for lack of omniscience, everyone&#x27;s knowledge will always be imperfect, and with perfect reasoning (= rationality) our actions can only be as good as the information we have.",1440693644

I think the poster was thinking closer to Vale Tudo (and, of course, MMA), which BJJ has close roots with.<p>BJJ is a descendant of Judo in that it essentially takes Judo to its logical conclusion. Judo (and BJJ) begin standing. But Judo ends with a simple series of points (take down into, maybe, a submission).<p>BJJ goes until someone taps. That is, you start the roll standing (or kneeling, which is more lax) and continue sparring until a submission is performed. Judo would stop after the take down and quick sub attempt.<p>The Gracies, however, did initially use BJJ as a form of self defense. It&#x27;s still very much an aspect of rolling to go for position over submission. While you can submit from traditionally vulnerable spots, you can also nullify your opponent&#x27;s offense, such as in guard.<p>Ultimately, however, you want to mount them or take their back. In a street fight, this dominate position would let you strike and choke with ease.<p>In fact, a lot of early BJJ schools would have people from other martial arts who would dojo storm. There&#x27;s a pretty well known story where one BJJ teacher (I forget who off hand) told his students to not strike with fist. Only slap.<p>So they would mount the opponent and slap at them until they could choke them.<p>I enjoy doing BJJ because I can train and spar at whatever intensity (light, medium, hard), and even go compete at tournaments, without injury.

So, government economists clearly believe that the price of these notes has a downstream impact on interest rates.<p>Second, the China sale is not &quot;artificially&quot; impacting bond prices, any more than I&#x27;m artificially impacting the price of avocados if I start buying all of them. As long as the price is a fair market price, then it&#x27;s by definition not artificial, because everyone is participating by their own free will.<p>Third, the reasoning for this impacting overall interest rates is that debt is a commodity. There is currently a balance in the market between investment in, for example, Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities that takes into account many factors such as yield, perceived risk, liquidity, etc. If Treasury notes suddenly become cheaper and offer a higher yield, then some money that would have gone into new mortgages will instead go into Treasuries. With the same number of borrowers competing for less money for home loans, the cost of that money (the interest rate) will go up.<p>Again, the key point is that the impact on Treasury rates is not artificial, it&#x27;s a real consequence of the sell-off of China&#x27;s holdings. One last analogy -- if I dump millions of gallons of water &quot;artificially&quot; into a reservoir, the river that it feeds will flood for real.

We see that it has decoupled significantly during the past 10 years and is now moving somewhat independently of the FFR. The Fed is stuck at the lower 0 bound and has no power over long term interest rates anymore. Janet Yellen has noted this publicly herself. [1]<p>What you are describing - the Fed purchase of more long-term US treasuries - is another wave of Quantitative Easing. The problem with QE is that, while it gives the financial system more liquidity, that liquidity has not passed on to the end consumers. So the Fed would be adding (potentially overpriced) liabilities to its already massive pile of debt in order to have a somewhat negligible effect on long-term interest rates, and to probably have no effect whatsoever on economic activity within the US.

10130314,comment,10127208,10127208,0,0,candybar,,,"This is a bizarre article.  The author seems to think that being a doctor, a lawyer, a management consultant or a dentist requires some kind of advanced interpersonal skills but this is not true at all.<p>The primary thing that qualifies to you become one of those is detailed technical knowledge and analytical skills, not too different from being a software engineer or a plumber.  Virtually no one tries to become a doctor and drops out either at pre-med or in medical school because they realize they can&#x27;t hack the social part of the job.  There&#x27;s a big difference between a job requiring social interactions and a job where you&#x27;re primarily judged by social and interpersonal skills.  If you place most jobs on the technical knowledge to the social skill spectrum, those jobs would be near the far technical end.<p>The author also seems to think that there was ever a point in time where social skills weren&#x27;t extremely important.  Management always paid very well and it&#x27;s by definition a job that requires social skills.  Jobs requiring primarily social skills and not much else are on a decline and also the types of social skills required in the marketplace have changed dramatically.  The internet as a medium massively increases connectivity and discoverability, obsoleting a lot of shallower social skills, like comfort with making introductions and being a low-level connector because it&#x27;s easier to find the people you need and verify their trustworthiness without having to rely on a connector.  On the other hand, it&#x27;s probably easier to build a truly massive network and those skills are probably valuable, even if they aren&#x27;t similar to traditional social skills.<p>One major trend I see is that being book smart is more important than ever because more interaction is taking place over online and face-to-face interactions are becoming less necessary.  This means understanding the medium and technology is more important than natural face-to-face social skills we learn when we&#x27;re younger and also the ability to communicate concisely and precisely and the ability to predict its impact ahead of time are more important.  Also the world is more complicated and simple technical knowledge is very easy to look up and learn - this makes advanced analytical and learning skills more important than simple, rote, static knowledge.  Being a well-adjusted, normal, sociable and outgoing person, which I think most people would associate with &quot;social skills&quot; speaking colloquially, is less important than it has been for a while.  The kind of social skills that get you paid well are more like the social skills that Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg have in abundance.<p>The other trend is that women are increasingly outperforming men at school, resulting in more book smart women.  That bodes well for women, much more than the author&#x27;s bizarre insistence that social skills are suddenly more important and that somehow women have better social skills than men, both of which are really questionable assertions.",1440692364

Why does it make sense for men to be more variable? Why aren&#x27;t women the variable sex?<p>Females get a huge advantage in reproduction of their genes: they are the gatekeeper of the gene line.

Females could biologically &quot;get away&quot; with extreme (but viable) variation because they&#x27;re practically guaranteed to reproduce anyway.

All you have to do is say the word &quot;bicycle&quot; and otherwise rational people suddenly turn into overprotective suburban soccer moms.  The way people talk about helmets, you&#x27;d think the average person knows at least five people who&#x27;ve died because they fell off a bicycle and their skulls exploded.<p>Here are some facts:<p>In 2013, 32,719 people were killed in road accidents.<p>Also in 2013, 4,735 pedestrians were killed.  The leading cause of injury to pedestrians is tripping and falling, but by far the leading cause of death is being hit by a car.<p>For cyclists in 2013, 743 were killed.  The leading cause of cyclist deaths is, again, being hit by a car.<p>At this point, even though these numbers show that bicycle deaths account for only .02% of deaths in the US each year (which completely disqualifies cycling accidents from being anywhere close to a health epidemic) people will inevitably point out that not many people ride bicycles, so that 743 is actually quite a large number.  Of course cars kill 20 times as many pedestrians as they do cyclists, because there are so many pedestrians, and so few cyclists, right?<p>While there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that statement, the fallacy is in thinking that you can just extrapolate from there with simple multiplication.  Cycling accounts for approximately 1% of all trips taken in the US.  So the logic is that if cycling accounted for 100% of all trips, instead of 32,719 we&#x27;d have 74,300 people dying in road accidents!  Terrifying!<p>Except it doesn&#x27;t work that way.  Remember that the leading cause of death to both pedestrians and cyclists alike is cars.  So if 100% of road traffic were cyclists, there wouldn&#x27;t be any cars to kill anyone.<p>Now is a good time to bring up The Netherlands, a country where cycling accounts for 27% of all trips, and in cities (where accidents of all types are much more likely) that number rises to more like 50%.  Even worse, practically nobody wears bike helmets there!  So clearly, their hospitals must be overflowing with people suffering from exploded skulls.  One can only imagine the carnage on their streets... because it doesn&#x27;t exist.  In 2013, 184 cyclists died in The Netherlands, which is .001% of their population.  Our 743 account for .0002% of our population, but if you multiply that by 27 (1% vs. 27% of all trips taken) you get .006%, which is 6 times as many deaths per capita.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s much safer to be a cyclist in a country where nobody wears a helmet but everybody bikes, than it is to be a cyclist in a country where virtually nobody does it, but at least you have a piece of styrofoam strapped to your head.<p>Why?  Because when more people bike, we build more infrastructure to support bikes.  Drivers become more aware of bikes, and instead of just gnashing their teeth and dangerously swerving around them, they&#x27;re familiar with how bikes move through traffic and see them as just another part of driving on a road.  Cyclists are more visible, motorists are more prepared, and everybody gets along better.  And bikeshare programs are exactly the kind of thing to promote more people riding bikes.<p>But wait, we still haven&#x27;t trotted out everyone&#x27;s favorite last-ditch argument when all else fails!  &quot;No matter what you say about big-picture statistics, you&#x27;d still be safer wearing a helmet.&quot;<p>Yes.  This is true.  Adding more shock absorption to the human skull can protect the brain from traumatic injury.  In fact, it&#x27;s so true that it applies to virtually every human activity.  So let&#x27;s really follow through, and make it mandatory to wear a helmet while driving or riding in an automobile.  Let&#x27;s make it mandatory for pedestrians to wear helmets.  Why stop there?  Let&#x27;s make it mandatory to wear full body armor any time you leave the house, and let&#x27;s make it illegal to sell or build anything with sharp corners.  Let&#x27;s spend our entire lives suspended in smooth carbon fiber tanks full of Jell-O, so that nothing is a danger to our well-being until a heart attack ends it all!<p>Incidentally, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US, is a real health epidemic, and is preventable by putting your butt in a bike seat and riding a few miles every day.<p>Sources:<p><a href=""http://www.pedbikeinfo.org/data/factsheet_crash.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pedbikeinfo.org/data/factsheet_crash.cfm</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_i...</a><p><a href=""https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2014/04/25/traffic-fatalities-decreased-significantly-in-2013/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2014/04/25/traffic-fatali...</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_the_Netherlands"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_the_Netherlands</a><p><a href=""http://www.treehugger.com/bikes/why-dutch-dont-wear-helmets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treehugger.com/bikes/why-dutch-dont-wear-helmets....</a>",1440692009

If security and customer privacy should always win absolutely, then the easiest way to achieve that would be to disable the internet.<p>The reality is that Google has decided that the damage to their bottom line (and the bottom line of the publishers who benefit financially from using their ad system) is greater than the likely damage of making this change. I can&#x27;t say whether or not their right, but it&#x27;s silly to pretend that Google simply said &quot;Security or profit?

The point is you expressly RAROC the two portfolios. A retail investor is not going to look at any of this as relevant, so avoiding leverage is pointless. Anyone benchmarking this asset class has access to leverage (and in this market, at low yields).",1440691277

Their only way to deliver profit is by achieving near monopoly status. Why are we subsidizing that behavior?<p>On the other hand, most companies are having a hard time investing in their own businesses and are instead buying their own shares to boost EPS. Companies that spend a lot to expand their business are good for the economy, so Amazon has a leg up on most firms there.<p>> We have a government on a spending binge, again fueled by cheap access to capital. How is slowing down that train a bad thing?<p>The government isn&#x27;t on a spending binge. We&#x27;ve had a Congress unable to agree on anything so we&#x27;re stuck under a budget freeze that happened thanks to the 2010 Budget Control Act and its sequester. Soft government spending has actually hurt US GDP and slowed the recovery.",1440691247

    Nothing ? s = Left s
    Just a ? _ = Right a


    foo :: Value -> Either String Int
    foo val = do
        nested <- val ^? key &quot;foo&quot; . key &quot;bar&quot; ? &quot;Could not find foo.bar&quot;
        mid <- nested ^? nth 2 . _Integral ? &quot;Second element of foo.bar was not an Integral value&quot;
        return mid
</code></pre>
which has really helped deal with the stringly typed nature of JSON. I should also mention I stole the idea (and operator name) from one of the Haskell parser combinator libraries which allowed you to name a whole parser expression, so errors would say &quot;could not find ident&quot; instead of &quot;Expected on of a,b,c,d,e,d,f,g,h...., found X&quot;",1440691225

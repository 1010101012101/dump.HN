If those are your priorties then why do you ever go out on a job? Certainly the safest place for you and yours to be is playing cards at the firehouse.<p>You know, I know, the reason you go out is because if you don&#x27;t go you&#x27;d be fired for insubordination. You&#x27;d be fired because you&#x27;re being paid to go out on those calls and take those risks. So you do the next best thing: you go out on the call, but you make a series of operational decisions that, essentially, make you as safe as if you didn&#x27;t go out on that call. And what&#x27;s your justification? So you can be well enough to go out on the next call - and not take risks there, either. So you end up going on call after call, and on each call acting for your own benefit, rationalized, you say, to keep you healthy for the next call.",1449784780

In fact it doesn&#x27;t make sense. Schedulers are not single threaded event loops. The scheduler (any scheduler) is entered in various scenarios. Sometimes voluntarily, sometimes not. Sometimes the scheduler code can run concurrently, sometimes not. Sometimes the scheduler code can run in parallel, sometimes not.<p>The Go scheduler is both concurrent and parallel.<p>> It runs, sequentially, in different threads which makes the situation confusing<p>I don&#x27;t know what this statement means. The Go scheduler certainly runs <i>on</i> different threads.

The check happens in every function prolog.<p>> More importantly, there&#x27;s a number of simultaneous syscalls that will kill a go program.<p>There&#x27;s self-imposed user-configurable limit that defaults to 10000 threads for running system calls.

Currency is an transferable i.o.u. worth whatever the creditor says it&#x27;s worth. The most pervasive currency is currently the greenback.

As someone who works with people who used to work with ICF, I&#x27;ve been told the reason that NIF flunked is that it was designed with 1D simulation codes because back then, that&#x27;s all they could manage. One of the issues they inevitably ran into were plasma instabilities similar to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities[0] that one only sees in two (or more) dimensional systems, but not 1D. These instabilities reduce the efficacy of heating and compression needed to achieve ignition, and were an unpleasant surprise when they actually performed the experiments. Even to this day, 2D simulations are fairly common and littered throughout the literature, and their justification (arguments of approximate symmetry) are suspect, at least to me. 3D sims are coming on the scene, but they often have to sacrifice things like spatial resolution that hurt&#x27;s the simulation&#x27;s physics in other way.<p>Computational feasibility is one of the things physicists in that field need to admit is holding them back, and may be a little humility in seeking out advice from computer scientists is warranted in my opinion[1].<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Taylor_instability"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Taylor_instab...</a><p>[1] this statement won&#x27;t give me much criticism here, but it wouldn&#x27;t go down well in a room of my peers.",1449781941

10713459,comment,10713290,10713290,0,0,danso,,,"Though I wouldn&#x27;t have guessed it earlier this year, this seems like a bygone conclusion. Last night I tried out the iPad Pro for the first time while killing time at an Apple Store...I liked it, though I&#x27;ve had an iPad since it first came out so there&#x27;s much less of that revelatory experience with each iteration. The store had the iPad Pros set up with the keyboard cases and I&#x27;ve never used my iPads with a keyboard so I was delightfully surprised that my favorite OS X shortcut -- Cmd-Tab -- worked for application switching. Unfortunately, none of the other shortcuts I&#x27;m used to worked, such as Cmd-T to open a new tab in the browser, and so forth.<p>In a way, the iPad Pro felt like tablet&#x27;s version of the uncanny valley...close to &quot;real&quot; computing but not annoyingly not quite enough...unless major overhauls are made to iOS, and every application built on it thus far, I couldn&#x27;t imagine using the iPad for anything more than media consumption. And when I think about it, I hardly ever use the iPad for any app that is iPad-only -- I use it mostly for web browsing, reading, and Netflix-watching -- things I can switch effortlessly to on my Macbook.<p>I had thought the Surface was doomed to fail, in trying to serve both as a tablet and as a regular computer and screwing up both...but in retrospect, it seems like the intuitive strategy. Most tablet functionality is purely a subset of what a regular laptop can do...and attempts to port OSX apps to iOS have rarely resulted in something that was better as a native tablet app. Adding to this, the majority of the computing world is already entrenched in Windows applications...even as someone who has been almost exclusively OS X for the last 10 years, my next tablet purchase will probably be a Surface...doing productive work on Excel and Windows-versions of Sublime Text is better than  attempting it on iOS by far.<p>edit: And maybe familiarity breeds contempt -- and/or I&#x27;m entering in my tech-curmudgeon phase...but besides the initial iterations on multi-touch -- two fingers to scroll, pinching, stretching, rotation -- I&#x27;ve been less than inspired by iOS&#x27;s innovations in touch gestures. In fact, I find myself frequently fighting against accidental actions, such as how dragging my fingers a little lazily to the left while reading a webpage triggers the browser&#x27;s Back action. And how I&#x27;m frequently accidentally activating my Slack app (because it&#x27;s the only one I have that has multitasking?) when my fingers do something on the right side of the browser. I feel we&#x27;ve reached the limits of what we can intuitively express via finger-motion gestures and if Surface&#x27;s tablet functionality had far fewer of them...that would actually be a net positive for me.",1449781548

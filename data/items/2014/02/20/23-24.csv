The whole point of staging a big spectacle blocking highways etc., with some rioting, is to get world headlines.  This has been happening in Venezuela for over 16 years.  If the country was really anti-Maduro, it wouldn&#x27;t have voted for him ten months ago.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not even like the opposition is united at all.  It&#x27;s completely factionalized, which is probably why it is out of power.  It also reeks of that lazy, upper class, kind of slow and dumb Castillian Spanish aristocratic sense you sometimes find in Latin America.  Like that man in the documentary &quot;The Revolution will not be televised&quot; who said &quot;Watch your servants!  They may be Chavistas!&quot;  Watch your servants, they may be Chavistas might as well be the slogan of the opposition.

7274522,comment,7273037,7273997,9,0,glesica,,,"To me, the problem with this argument is that there is, in fact, no connection between what is best for society and what is profitable. In theory, there should be, but it isn&#x27;t an intrinsic thing, it&#x27;s created deliberately and must be maintained.<p>When you have the money, you make the rules. That sums up the problem. Markets are not magical creatures, they exist within the context of social rules and norms. Selling human beings was once seen as rather profitable. Then society decided that selling human beings was wrong, even though it was profitable. You clearly understand this, we banned slavery, we didn&#x27;t just ban investing in slavery-related businesses.<p>What I think you are missing is that there are a ton of things that are between &quot;good for society&quot; and something along the lines of slavery that is clearly a bad thing. The problem with these middle &quot;bads&quot; is that they aren&#x27;t bad enough to be universally and energetically rejected.<p>This means that there is plenty of room for people with money to get these things made legal, or kept legal, and it is these things that often seem to be more profitable than other, more socially beneficial, activities (possibly because fewer people are morally willing and able to do them). I think of this sort of thing as &quot;meta-competition&quot; because it is competition among those with money to most efficiently turn their money into influence and power that can be used to allow them to make even more money.<p>As long as money can be converted to power, you can&#x27;t assume, as you have done, that whatever is legal is socially beneficial (or at least not socially destructive).",1392940542

The oil.<p>You know this yourself. Just take a quick look at Silicon Valley - it&#x27;s a hotbed of innovation. If you believed this argument, you&#x27;d expect to see a dirge of new businesses & a desert of new ideas. That&#x27;s just not true. We have wearable tech. Quantified self. Bank challengers. News extractors. And things that don&#x27;t even have names. The place is full of vibrant startups & new ideas. Just compare it to the energy, banking or agriculture sector.<p>So, why is the argument wrong?<p>Because buyouts /liberate/ innovative entrepreneurs from their old companies so they can go onto to found new startups - new startups that push the envelope again. San Fran is full of serial entrepreneurs who skip from one place to the next - first, revolutionising auctioning. Then, payment processing. Then, something else.<p>Just look at the PayPal mafia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal_Mafia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal_Mafia</a><p>What if PayPal hadn&#x27;t been bought out. YouTube might not have existed. Nor LinkedIn. Nor Palantir. SpaceX. Yelp. Yammer.<p>Buyouts lets these innovative people sell-up - at the right price - and move on. Not only that, but they allow them to move on with additional capital that they can plough into their next venture.<p>If buyouts didn&#x27;t happen as often, entrepreneurs would have to wait another 3-5 years - or even longer than that - for an IPO. It would lock in capital, and enterprise would suffer. Plus, an IPO is mighty expensive & just not right for some businesses.<p>Entrepreneurs would be locked into their first companies.<p>This &#x27;lock-in effect&#x27; is exactly what happens when Governments raise Capital Gains Tax - the tax on the profits of selling a business. If it&#x27;s harder (or more costly) for an entrepreneur to cash out and move on, they stagnate - and so does innovation.

Facebook bought this company because it was a threat. There is not much value in being #5 in social media. Facebook has to destroy or acquire every serious competitor that comes along, or they will start hemorrhaging users. You don&#x27;t acquire a company to get <i>new</i> users so much as you acquire the company to keep from losing customers due to declining mind share and &#x27;coolness&#x27;, and thus to keep growing customers organically (because you are #1, not because you own FoobyAppInc). They paid $19B not because they put a dollar amount on each user, they paid that because that is what it took to get the other side to say &#x27;yes&#x27; to acquisition. (All my own opinion, I claim no knowledge of what actually went down or what MZ actually thinks).<p>And that is the biggest reason I will never buy Facebook stock. You can take them out, or force their hand, with a few million dollars in VC and an idea. You don&#x27;t need $50B, or what have you to challenge them, (whereas you would need at least that amount to challenge Ford, Coca Cola, and what have you).<p>The above is all from a value investor&#x27;s perspective, of course, where you do not merely look at free cash flow valuation but also look at the company&#x27;s moat (how easy is the company to defend from competitors).<p>edit: I hypothesize that Facebook and similar companies will find themselves in a very similar situation as Berkshire Hathaway when it was just a textile factory freshly purchased by Warren Buffett. They had to dump endless amounts of money just to break even. A competitor would buy a new loom that is 5% more efficient, and so BH would have to spend capital to get that same loom to remain competitive. It did not yield an advantage to either company. It may help the customer if prices can be lowered after the equipment is paid off, but the CEO&#x27;s job is to reward stockholders, not customers. Buffett eventually shut it down as a money pit. It is not a foregone conclusion that this will happen to Facebook, but it seems likely, and is enough to have any rational value investor running away in terror.",1392939611

While it clearly works for Facebook (and many others), I&#x27;ve always had little problems with it.  Connections silently fail (next request times out, following requests work again) if you don&#x27;t make a call in long enough with some of the bindings.  Generated servers sometimes leak memory.  The type system is nice but creates all kinds of headaches when trying to reconcile it with something idiomatic in different languages.  When many different services need to talk to <i>each other</i> it requires a lot of connections, each of which I came to view as a liability.  Thrift&#x27;s semantics are actually underspecified (<a href=""http://twitter.github.io/scrooge/Symantics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.github.io/scrooge/Symantics.html</a>) so Twitter, who uses Thrift, came out with Scrooge, which is mostly compatible but not always.<p>My lesson was that Thrift is great if you have people who can look after it all the time.  Thrift connections were never something you could forget about for a little while if you had a small team, though.<p>We&#x27;ve been moving away from Thrift towards a message queue-based system (using RabbitMQ) that lets us do everything Thrift does and more, and works every time.  It used to be so nice to start a new service by writing the IDL and getting everyone to agree on a clean, well-bounded interface.  Facebook forking their own project is kind of a last straw for my faith in Thrift, though.  Oh well.",1392939581

Its not just about putting in effort - its about putting in a lot of effort. &#x27;properly&#x27; is a vague term and i know what it means to me but nobody else does - its best demonstrated what i mean with examples:<p>not proper effort:<p>+ trying to reduce emissions to reduce pollution<p>+ no littering signs<p>+ banning environmentally damaging behaviour<p>proper efforts:<p>+ building plants/factories/machines whose sole purpose is to capture and fix or otherwise convert nasty gasses and particulates<p>+ actively cleaning existing damage, e.g. dedicated missions to get some of that plastic out of our oceans<p>+ outlawing the burning of petrol, shutting down the petrochemical industry (in total, even the good bits), stealing its assets and using them for projects to repair existing damage<p>to use a horrible analogy if you get lung cancer you don&#x27;t just quit smoking - you want to cut the cancer out and throw it away. quitting smoking at that point is just a bad joke...<p><i></i>*<p>maybe i came across too strongly (do you mean disingenuous as &#x27;dishonest&#x27; or &#x27;wrong&#x27; - lots of people use it as &#x27;wrong&#x27; to sound clever which is horrible...?) especially in light of this argument which shows another difference of perspective:<p>> It&#x27;s perfectly plausible instead, that nature as we know it today is going to disappear, to be replaced by wasteland, while still having the capability to acceptably sustain human life.<p>This had entered my head - this is very possible but its also not what i consider to be the real enough consequences to kick us up the ass. A gradual decline in quality of life is easy to ignore... an immediate threat to your life is not. I don&#x27;t think people will magically be motivated if their quality of life degrades - unless its rapid and potentially fatal.<p>This is a real problem.

WAL ( or archive logs in Oracle terminology) are still used for point in time recovery for changes that have occurred since the last incremental backup.  One advantage is that if a row is updated 100 times between the base and incremental backup, you will only essentially be backing up the last change in your incremental backup versus WAL which will have all 100 changes. For big DBs, this can be very handy.<p>&quot;somewhat harder to swith back&quot;<p>Thats my point exactly. In Oracle switching between primary and standby is easy and you can do it back and forth as needed with no need to worry about rebuilding the database. In Postgres this is not yet the case, but most of the infrastructure is there already so its surprising it hasn&#x27;t been done.<p>I&#x27;m also looking forward to logical replication.

The geniuses behind De Beers recognized early on that a stable, profitable diamond industry depended on controlling both supply and demand. De Beers rarely discovers new sources of diamonds; rather, it focuses on controlling existing ones, limiting production, and if necessary buying up surplus gems and stockpiling them to prop up the market. It sets prices arbitrarily and cuts off supplies to dealers who buy through unauthorized channels. On the marketing side, De Beers hired advertising firms, starting with N.W. Ayer in the late 1930s, to render axiomatic the idea that diamonds = true love.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2524/is-a-diamonds-price-a-true-measure-of-its-value"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2524/is-a-diamonds-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-rise-and-fall-of-diamonds-edward-jay-epstein/1013550616?ean=2940012796721"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-rise-and-fall-of-diamond...</a>",1392938002

Four of which are actually eight more registers (AX is AH and AL; BX is BH and BL; CX is CH and CL; DX is DH and DL).  Each of these registers has a special purpose (BX can be used to index memory, the rest can&#x27;t; CX is used in some instructions as a count; AX is your accumulator, and DX is ... just there).  There are four more special purpose index registers, SI, DI, BP and SP.  SI and DI support post-index and post-decrement indexing mode, but you need to set a flag in another register (CF register) to indicate you want the post-increment mode OR the post-decrement mode.  SP is the stack register, but you can&#x27;t use it as an index register (you can starting with the 80386).  You can use the BP register as an index register, but it <i>always</i> takes an offset (there is no special mode for a 0 index).<p>Then you get to the segment registers.  As if things weren&#x27;t bad enough.  There are four, CS to point to code, DS and ES for data, and SS for the stack.  You see, the 8086 can address 1MB of memory (20 bits), but it&#x27;s a 16bit instruction set.  So the segment registers contain not the upper 4-bits of the address, but the physical address divided by 16 (or, shifted right four bits).  A physical address is formed by SEGMENTx16+OFFSET, giving you 20 bits of address. Most instructions and addressing modes use DS, except if you use BP, which defaults to SS, and the store-post-increment/decrement instructions, which <i>must</i> use ES:DI (DI is incremented---ES doesn&#x27;t).  You <i>can</i> override the segment register for <i>most</i> instructions, but not all (the string instructions, which give you the post-increment/decrement addressing modes are the exception).<p>And because of these segment registers, you can have 16 or 32 bit function pointers, 16 or 32 bit data pointers, and 16 or 32 bit stack pointers.<p>So what you have is an instruction set that is almost, but not entirely consistently inconsistent.  The 80186 gives you a few more instructions.  The 80286 adds protected mode (with four levels of protection) with a change of how the segment registers work (in protected mode---they&#x27;re now indexes into a table of physical addresses for each segment, each of which can only be 64K in size), and the 80386, which extends all the registers to 32 bits in size (except for the segment registers---they&#x27;re still only 16 bits long), adds new registers only available in the highest protection ring, <i>and</i> paged memory, in addition to keeping the <i>segmented</i> memory, plus allowing all the registers to more general purpose, in addition to keeping the old instruction set.<p>I&#x27;m really hard pressed to come up with a more convoluted architecture than the x86.",1392937357

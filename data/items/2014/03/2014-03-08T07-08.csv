If a poor American happens to lose use of a car (breakdown, gas price, etc), he/she immediately starts having hard time just getting to work. They could, but it takes 1-2 hr each way. The same commute would take half that time with a private car.<p>And don&#x27;t forget they have to pick up kids, go to medical care, grocery shop, etc.<p>In other countries with well connected/cheap public transportation, no such barrier exists.",1394265411

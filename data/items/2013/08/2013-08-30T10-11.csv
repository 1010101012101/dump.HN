6301088,comment,6300664,6300664,21,0,Aldipower,,,"Slightly off topic.<p>In germany there&#x27;s a movement called Freifunk.
The ambition is to build a community driven open Wifi-Mesh-Network by flashing low-cost routers with the Freifunk firmware. So these routers can auto discover their neighbours and then connects via the routing protocol called batman-adv to a mesh. If there&#x27;s no neighbour router, batman-adv gets tunneled over the internet to connect to the Freifunk network.
It&#x27;s an IPv6 network with gateways to the IPv4 internet.<p>The problem in Germany is, that on the country-side, there are a lot of dark holes by providing broadband internet. 
Some villages has to connect with 64kbit/s. We have the year 2013..
What the people in these villages do is, they hire one big fibre and share it over the community driven Freifunk mesh network to gain broadband access to all the people in the village.",1377860303

I consider someone to be an expert at something when they &#x27;know what they don&#x27;t know&#x27;.<p>But, what you are saying isn&#x27;t limited to MOOCs.<p>When you are learning on your own to fully understand something, you don&#x27;t let magic fly. When I learned my first programming language I didn&#x27;t allow myself to use any libraries at all. I made myself make everything from scratch so I knew what every moving piece was doing.<p>In my opinion, the onus is on the student. I work with plenty of devs who have CS degrees from top schools who will look for a library to do something that can be implemented with a line or two or code if they would take a few minutes to learn about it. Sometimes it&#x27;s laziness, sometimes they don&#x27;t seem to have the ability to learn something without it being force fed to them. I&#x27;ve also had problems with some of them during code reviews because they don&#x27;t know what they don&#x27;t know, and in their case they have a piece of paper that says they are experts so they refuse to listen and learn.<p>These courses are far from perfect, but they are a stepping stone for people who have a burning desire to learn.

Reading the Wikipedia article (<a href=""http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbeitserlaubnis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbeitserlaubnis</a>) right, it states that:
&quot;Asylbewerber drfen fr die ersten 12 Monate berhaupt nicht arbeiten ( 61 Abs. 2 AsylVfG), anschlieend gilt ein nachrangiger Arbeitsmarktzugang nach der BeschVerfV (siehe oben).&quot;
Which translates to: people seeking asylum must not take up any employment for the first 12 month.<p>As well as &quot;Asylberechtigte, Konventionsflchtlinge ( 25 Abs. 1 und 2 AufenthG) sowie Auslnder mit einer Niederlassungserlaubnis ( 9 Abs. 1 AufenthG) haben nach dem Aufenthaltsgesetz ein Recht auf Erwerbsttigkeit.&quot;, which transaltes to: people granted asylum (and some others) holding a residence permit, are allowed to work.<p>That&#x27;s both ends of the spectrum, so there may be some middle ground after 12 month.

I remember from my univ days (comp sci) we have this algorithm and data structures course. Typical lecture (2 hours) went like this:<p>-introduce some completely new (for most of the audience) algorithm or a data structure<p>-start doing advanced analysis of its complexity in various cases (or in case of data structure costs of various operations)<p>The problem with that is that when you encounter something new you usually need some time to get familiar with it, to play around with it for a while to get intuitive grasp of what that thing is and what properties it has. Without it it&#x27;s very difficult to follow any advanced analysis because you probably don&#x27;t even fully understand how the thing works for various inputs/doing various operations. 
As it was, 75% of the lecture was too difficult to follow for most of the audience which showed (most people zoned out and just mindlessly taking notes).<p>It would be much better if home assignment before the lecture was to read some theory and maybe try to implement the algorithm/data structure to see what problems you encounter and then you would come to the lecture with specific questions to answer and understanding what may constitute a hard part.
This flipping approach makes a lot of sense to me. It&#x27;s similar to learning by doing: you first get some very basic understanding and then try to do things and learn along. Traditional approach on the other hand is similar to reading several 500p+ books about OOP and Java and not writing a single line of code along the way.",1377859108

In fact he&#x27;s actively involved in getting Homebrew&#x27;s GHC formula prepped for OS X Mavericks, which you note as an upcoming issue below.  So that&#x27;s encouraging.<p>And while the stability of GHC/Haskell Platform was indeed questionable during 2012.2.0.0 and the beginning of 2012.4.0.0, they cleaned it up as time went along and I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues with it for the past 4 or 5 months.  You make a comment below about Haskell Platform being associated with specific GHC releases, and AFAIK Homebrew actually freezes GHC at versions compatible with the current release of Haskell Platform now.  The reason I prefer to use the package manager instead of the pre-distributed binaries is because it provides for a deterministic and (theoretically) testable/repeatable upgrade path.",1377859095

I used to have an informal policy where a teacher would just <i>tell</i> me they were working on getting a purchase order, and I&#x27;d credit their subscription.  I changed that to only crediting them a month at a time (after one situation where I realized towards the end of the year that one PO had never arrived.. it was stressful for the teacher, but all resolved amicably), but still, there&#x27;s trust involved.<p>If I didn&#x27;t trust them, a lot of these teachers would just be stuck without access for weeks -- the site would be far less useful to them.<p>- Edit: &quot;until the cash is in the bank, don&#x27;t change your <i>life</i>&quot; still applies in my situation; payment was slow and unreliable (though paid in the long run), and that does affect planning.",1377857898

I ended up just taking a few of the really nice things from Drupal, and making a new framework around those.<p>I loved Drupal when I was limited to building sites in PHP. It worked around a great deal of common problems in PHP, and was well documented with a good community, etc...<p>Still, most of the advantages came from having a semi-regulated environment to use to implement CMS projects in PHP. Once you have a sane language like Python, it would be a huge waste to do a direct port. The result would be profoundly unpythonic, and give you no particular benefits because of it.<p>If you adapt it to make it more pythonic, then you lose the benefit of familiarity for new users. As it is, it's not really like you'll ever be able to use existing Drupal modules in a Python reimplementation; even if you could, it's hard enough keeping modules working across different versions of Drupal, much less entirely different platforms.",1254761616

I am not concerned about the tenth of a second I save by not typing y and o but the one second I do spend making ""u"" ""you"" again. The kind of short hand (or SMS) language is just the part of the authors habit. Has it became just so ""aesthetically displeasing"" to read ""u"" as the word and not alphabet?<p>As to the fuckery analogy I wanna say that it would not leave the post entirely understandable because you will have to still think if the word was actually part of the sentence or not?But I think (dont bother to deny it) that everybody who owns a mobile or had used internet would know simple things like ""u"" stands for ""you"",""ur"" stands for ""your"" and ""bt"" for ""but"". And if they dont its entirely possible to get that from context. But your fuckery example is just opposite.Nobody will ""know"" and will at least have contemplate as to whats the use of that word in the context.<p>For the 1337 point I wanna say two things. First if the author sounds like six but has a good or at least competent thing to say then whats the matter?You should just except the authors view and choice, also be scared by the fact that he is competent with you by the age of 6 and he would be surely outsmarting you when he reaches your age. Secondly I too dont like such 1337 language, but only when the spellings are so obscure that the reader may never even begin to understand what the word is. But again when someone rights ""u"" you can easily understand that he means ""you"" which is not the case when someone writes 1337 $|o3/-\|< |=/-\57 3|\|0U9|-| u </-\|\| 937 /-\ |0T 0F \/\//-\7 |7 5/-\5, 7|-|3|\| U c/-\|\| F|9uR3 0u7 \/\//-\7 u |\/||553o|.<p>I know to some people atmosphere is very important (like my college professors), but what dont understand is why these people dont understand that for some people it is not. To some people its just the content that matters the most (if you can understand it fully of course). If you expect people to respect your choice, why not first start to respect theres? Or like mahatma Gandhi once put it ""You should be the change you want to see in the world"". And here by change i mean respect for other people's choice.<p>PS:- I dont really care if you are down voting me or not, I am already having a rough day at the forum and I am actually eager to see if karma can go into negative or not.Nor do I expect a standing ovation to this post but this is exactly I feel in 500 words.<p>Edit: Now I officially Know that karma can go into negative, but I would like that people who down vote may just give me a reason as to why they did it",1254759717

I don't know whether Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), or whatever has replaced it, currently supports regular expressions, but back around 1999 or 2000 defining a reference to Windows Scripting Host (WSH) provided that functionality.  Very useful for making and extracting pattern matches; in my case, I needed to identify particular codes within a large, freeform text field that multiple people at multiple facilities filled in each in their own fashion.<p>Excel does have plenty of quirks, which can be rather aggravating.  My un-favorite:  Applying a text formatting function to something like 2334d2 resulted in 233400 rather than 2334D2 because the formatting function was hard-wired to recognize ""d[number]"" as specifying an exponent even when your formula or code was applying <i>text</i> formatting.  (Which interpretation apparently, as I was eventually told by someone with experience in the area, comes from Fortran.  The same thing happened with ""e""; at least ""e[exponent]"" I was familiar with; ""d..."" caught me by surprise).<p>So, some bozo or bozos send you a lot of semi-regular data.  You shove it into Excel, where some of your cleanup is automated, and Excel makes it very quick to navigate around and manually fix the rest.<p>BTW, I've not used OO Calc for anything significant, but I continue to read here and there that for serious spreadsheeting, it still cannot compare to Excel.",1254759500

1385461,comment,1383488,1383488,0,0,benatkin,,,"These types of productivity articles have been an excuse for me to keep spending too much time on HN. The thing is, I already know most of what's in the articles, but I'm not doing such a great job of executing them. Freeing up time by spending less time on HN could help. So, perhaps finding these articles the way I do is a net productivity loss.<p>Of the articles I've read on the topic, though, I think this is a really good one. I like the point about seeing how something you really like is built. I think this must be how people get started with Cappuccino. It's weird, but it does some really neat things. The same could be said of Cassandra.<p>Edit: I just realized this comment reads like a Yelp review. It starts completely off topic, and gradually gets on topic. Please forgive me. :)",1275011851

1385459,comment,1383376,1383376,0,0,howradical,,,"My advice:<p>- It's not as much money as you think. That might sound ridiculous to people without it, but you're not going to start living the Entourage lifestyle on 5m. You are 20, not 60 and it's unlikely you will ever get a higher return on an investment. It's your duty to protect and grow this wealth.<p>- You can't stop working, I tried and failed. Take some time off, travel, find a new passion or start over with a new company. Your life is just beginning.<p>- I'd suggest reading about Value Investing. I'm not saying you should invest your own money, but you damn well better know what's going on with it and why. Understand that inflation will eat away at this without the proper defense. Understand the ramifications of investments: liquidity, taxes, cash flow, etc.<p>- Keep a low profile, people are going to come out of the woodwork for lunches/pitches/loans/gimmicks. Be polite, but be stern (the answer should almost always be no).<p>- Get a good local attorney and a good accountant ASAP, an afternoon of research should point you in the right direction. Talk to them about asset protection plans.<p>- Stick with what you know (assuming it's computers). People are going to suggest all sorts of things, but do you really want to be a landlord, run a Subway, own a carwash, etc? I'm not saying you can never go in a new direction, but be careful. It's about 1000x easier to lose a fortune than make one.<p>- Buy yourself a nice, not extravagant house. Treat yourself to something ""fancy"" (say a slightly used BMW, not a Ferrari) and the rest goes away. Set a comfortable monthly budget, DO NOT GO OVER THAT BUDGET. Make a spreadsheet of your investments, get a Mint account, find leaks and plug the holes.<p>- Invest your money in a mix of stocks/bonds/treasuries. Spread the stocks across different markets (US/China/Asia/Japan/Europe), it should be about half of your asset allocation. Keep about 5% accessible.<p>- Stick with your friends and family, be careful with girls and sign a prenup.",1275011796

Oceanfront residential, land not houses.<p>The point is, this property is always in high demand and even though it fluctuates with the market and did burst with everything else, prime real estate is always worth the same relative to the broad market of consumable goods. Which is really what you want to measure by (if you are only looking to protect your net worth), economies will inflate and deflate, as well currency and debt backed assets are a horrible way to keep net worth (its a good way to get rich quick, if you know what you are doing). Take gold for example (a true asset) it was once said that ""an ounce gold in the 1800's would buy you a nice suit, and today an ounce of gold will still buy you a nice suit"" the economy has changed but the worth is relatively constant.<p>That is the crux of what you are looking for if you are just trying to protect your net worth. If we look at it in a simple analogy x piece of property is worth y horses. x property may be worth $100 at current market and y horses may be worth $10 at current market, but general x property is worth y horses. It may vary slightly but the two stay relatively in sync.<p>This is how you need to think about assets and protecting net worth not in terms of dollars. When you do this it makes the picture of investing far simpler (for inflationary hedging and protecting net worth).<p>Now if you are looking for speculation to try to increase net worth then it is a whole different ball game and requires educating yourself extensively because as it was said before financial adviser really have no incentive to make you rich. If that is what you are looking for advice on the best advice is don't take any, you have to educate yourself and by all means start small.",1275010433

1385425,comment,1384994,1384994,0,0,strlen,,,"I agree that attitude trumps pure intelligence in general for programming projects. Indeed, pure intelligence tests (e.g., ""why are manhole covers round?"") fell out of favour as interview techniques at Microsoft. As far as I know (my own and friends' personal interview experience) Google never used such for programming interviews: ability to apply intelligence to the task at hand (programming, software engineering/architecture and algorithm/data-structure design) is what the industry leaders look for. This (the ability to strip away non-mathematical details and break a problem down to pieces that are machine-solvable, preferably by known and proven algorithms) in itself takes not just intelligence, but also practice.<p>Nonetheless, there are some projects that require a minimal amount of intelligence and/or education and beyond that no amount of attitude can help. E.g., I'd love to hack on applications of machine learning algorithms, but I don't have the educational background to do so. It would require years of serious study to be able to even do even the most basic work in that field.<p>On the topic of the author's previous post, I would agree that a way to get top programmers to work on less-interesting business applications is to let them use a more interesting language. In fact, some of the most difficult development (systems programming, scientific computing) goes on in fairly boring languages (although using higher level languages for this sort of work is becoming a reality).<p>I will, however, take strong issue with the assertion that Common Lisp is a language <i>only</i> suitable to top percentile of programmers: countless schools teach Scheme as the first programming language to undergraduates and Scheme is a much more functional language than idiomatic Common Lisp. Macros aren't inherently related to functional programming (nor is writing your own macros required for Lisp hacking, Graham is fairly unique in this respect). Closures (a heavily used feature of Common Lisp) aren't inherently functional, neither are multiple dispatch nor dynamic typing. Lack of syntax is a salient feature, orthogonal to all other distinguishing features (except for macros) and again, not especially ""functional"". If it's possible for newbies to write fairly mind-bending Scheme(1), why shouldn't it be possible for educated and experienced (even if not 99.99th percentile aptitude-wise) programmers to do the same in a less pure language (Common Lisp, OCaml)?<p>(1) My alma matter (which most people, even those living next to it, haven't heard of) uses Haskell: <a href=""http://www.cse.scu.edu/~atkinson/teaching/wi10/070/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cse.scu.edu/~atkinson/teaching/wi10/070/</a>",1275010165

1385396,comment,1384848,1384848,0,0,cianestro,,,"This isn't a very technical or sophisticated method but it works for my cohorts and I. When considering a new startup idea or really anything (domain name, features, marketing) we just put all our ideas up on the wall for about a week or two. By the end of the week, whichever idea has been built upon the most (variants or child ideas) is pursued and the others shamelessly forgotten. If no idea gets built upon it means our current work is more fertile than any of the new ones.<p>Also, #5 struck my attention and echoes the fact that most good ""new"" ideas are too contrarian for the general public to pick up on and are hardly profitable right off the bat.  Some say primordial Google (search) was in this boat but Yahoo had existed since 1995 along with others, hints the next ""______""s are easier for people to find because they are fed up with the old system and will type in ""______"" without spam/flashy ads or ""_______"" with such and such feature that works. People first need to know what ""_______"" is to search for it. A fact that spells disaster for truly revolutionary ideas.",1275009311

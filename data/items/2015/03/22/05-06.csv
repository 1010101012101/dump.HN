9245781,comment,9242773,9244984,0,0,davvid,,,"<i>Personally I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so useful of a feature; it saves typing a few asterisks but obscures the fact that you&#x27;re actually modifying some other variable</i><p>There are many real-world use cases where references are exactly the right feature, and the const-ness of that reference should make the intentions clear.<p>Performance-critical code is one place where not having the ability to pass large objects around by reference would be a performance killer.  References allow us to avoid making unnecessary copies.<p>Yes, you can accomplish the same thing with a pointer, but raw pointers are much less common in modern C++.  It&#x27;s not just syntactic sugar; a reference conveys information. When writing a function you can eschew null pointer checks when using references, whereas a function taking a (raw) pointer should handle the null pointer case since technically you can call foo(nullptr) and it&#x27;ll compile.<p>With a reference bar must exist for the foo(bar) expression to compile when calling void foo(const Bar& bar), so it&#x27;s safer, simpler code.",1427003942

Vancouver&#x27;s wages have remained unchanged for a few decades, barely adjusting for inflation.<p>Having grown up in Vancouver, I feel sad, sad that I have to leave my hometown to find better opportunities. I find that most sane people have already left Vancouver, including my circles. Senior engineers are hard to find in Vancouver because nobody with a family are willing to stick around for a low salary and high cost of living. Employees know that the labor market is tight and that people are desperate for jobs, and frequently exploit them. Tech companies are strapped for cash, large tech companies come to Vancouver to hire foreigners (Microsoft being the most controversial to date), video game industry is unstable.<p>Vancouver is a sinking ship.",1427003924

With React, you don&#x27;t think about patching DOM to the right result, you only think about how the final result should looks.<p>Understanding to latest state of document overtime is also harder with manually patched DOM. You can&#x27;t be sure how the current DOM looks like after lots of patching.\nWith React, you know exactly how the current document looks like, given value of props and state. Every programmer knows that referential transparent function is easier to reason about than state full function. React&#x27;s render method makes rendering a referential transparent function, as opposed to manually patching part of the DOM.<p>React is not about performance, it&#x27;s about making it easier to write Component that works.

9245774,comment,9243169,9243169,0,0,danans,,,"Articles demonizing coding interviews always attack strawmen that are the worst kind of interview questions:\n1) Trivia questions (i.e. &quot;what is the name of the method to do X in Java&quot;)\n2) Questions with precisely 1 solution (you either get the one solution or you don&#x27;t).<p>These are indeed useless technical interview questions.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t meant there aren&#x27;t good technical coding interview questions.  I tend to favor the kind that present a candidate with some example data and a set of constraints or patterns, and ask them to write code that analyses the data for those patterns or constraints and reports them.  This sort of problem is ubiquitous in my domain.  Importantly, I always choose problems for which there are multiple possible attack angles, not just one.  And I don&#x27;t give a hoot about syntax errors, or what language they use.<p>This sort of question gives you a good sense about the candidate&#x27;s analytical capability (breaking down the &quot;word problem&quot;), and their ability to translate their problem-solving thought process into code.  Because there are always multiple angles of attack, candidates have some leeway to exercise creativity.<p>In the end, it&#x27;s not terribly important to me that they get the optimal solution.  I do care whether they demonstrate strong analytical capability in the literal sense, meaning they can decompose the problem and the associated programming exercise into their logical parts and implement them.  I also look for good communication skills in the questions they ask when reasoning through the problem - this is something that only an in-person technical interview can reveal, AFAICT.<p>There are probably many smart candidates that don&#x27;t do well on these questions because they&#x27;re just having an off day, or nervous, or don&#x27;t perform well under pressure. I sympathize with them, because I&#x27;ve been there and felt all of the above.<p>But if the goal of a technical interview is to assess a candidate&#x27;s analytical and coding abilities, and their ability to do both simultaneously, there is no shortcut I know of to just giving them a role-relevant problem to work on.<p>EDIT:wording.",1427003818

9245770,comment,9244005,9244374,0,0,rektide,,,"GTOR to me seems to be about finding intents, looking at different signallings of thing or things happening across time. You state in the first paragraph that there&#x27;s a clash with how GTOR views things, and you have three paragraphs prostelytizing for greenthreading assuming that I understood the initial clash you saw, but you&#x27;ve provided very little context to explain the &quot;namely, [GTOR] confuse[s] intent (or abstraction with implementation&quot;<p>Are you getting hung up on the fact that GTOR talks through some specific apis for reactivity? You seem very much opposed to letting someone mention callbacks, prormises or observability? But GTOR is itself about mentioning these things so we can get past them and think of reactivity more generally. Yet you seem mired in your hatred for these concepts, in a way that prevents you from seeing that the article is about building effectful processing- having code or data whose effect is the running of other code, in a general fashion. And your inability to see that generalness, your forcing some weird diatribe against non-greenthreaded systems as all missing the point, is there rooted itself in confusing an implementation with intent, for surely blocking or no, concurrent or non, code and data will create reactions amid others.<p>I suggest getting more into the categories about. Sometimes binding happens before event, sometimes event before looking. Sometimes event is singular, sometimes it&#x27;s over a duration, sometimes it&#x27;s ongoing- edge, level triggering and continuous. Sometimes event has concurrency sometimes it&#x27;s over time.<p>None of these don&#x27;t make sense in Erlang or any other runtime, even if you might not see them expressed as first class constructs with apis, even if the reactivity were more baked in, as Erlangs send is.<p>Most of all, I have a very hard time understanding what your clash really is.

9245769,comment,9245360,9245360,0,0,underwater,,,"The web is great in theory but is somewhat broken in practice. What I&#x27;d like to see:<p>* The web as a first class citizen on mobile. Apple have a lot to answer for here. For example Safari went years without having a position: fixed implementation and with an artificial 300ms delay on every tap event. That&#x27;s crazy. They&#x27;re either malicious or don&#x27;t care. Neither is good for the web.<p>* Faster progress shipping new technology. We&#x27;ve had smartphones for a decade and we&#x27;re only now seeing proposals for offline access and notifications.<p>* Access to lower level APIs. Browser vendors don&#x27;t trust developers and as a result give us APIs that are crippled and late. See the sad state of workers and lack of text measurement APIs, or access to layout, or image decoding, or the cache.<p>Google are doing some good work here but then they go and release inflexible techonolgy like their transition API, service workers or web components that work brilliantly if you write web apps in the exact way they envision but are useless otherwise.<p>Real innovation is happening in third party libraries and frameworks. Browser vendors need to acknowledge that and support those projects instead of trying to replicate them natively.<p>* Publishers should stop shoveling crap on their sites. App upsell interstitials and overlay ads create a terrible experience that makes the web feel like shit. They wouldn&#x27;t do that in their own native apps but standards are lower in the web.<p>* Developers need to stop kidding themselves about the web being as powerful as native. We try and tell ourselves the experience is just as good and point to toy apps and painfully optimized tech demos. It&#x27;s not as good. And it&#x27;s not going to get better until we raise our expectations about what our tools should be able to do.",1427003676

Same is true now that I&#x27;m a self-employed industry analyst. It&#x27;s about relationships, and having the relationships be productive in specific ways.<p>Self-promotion generally takes some cleverness. It shares aspects with my previous example -- you use people who like you in ways that are productive, that don&#x27;t harm them (or, much better, explicitly help them), and don&#x27;t cause them to stop liking you. This requires understanding of other people&#x27;s needs and motivations.<p>I did some clever negotiating things back in the day -- getting a game theory PhD in 1979 pretty much guaranteed that I was a negotiation &quot;expert&quot; in the 1980s, although subsequently general understanding of game theory and negotiation advanced and obviated such an advantage.<p>The first time a company threatened me with a scary libel suit I got their arch-competitor to, the same day, offer to pay my legal fees.

It might have made sense on dial-up, but not really for mobile clients. The fact that you&#x27;ve completely broken the whole thing (eg: no mirroring with wget) doesn&#x27;t make up for the savings. Also, if you&#x27;d kept the/a single html-file -- that file would&#x27;ve been cached, so doing some js-magic with hide/show should be instant, after the thing is downloaded. That&#x27;s the old Dreamweaver way of pre-loading content (set sections/div/whatever as display:none, and toggle on mouseover link/clicks etc).<p>So this is not degrading css, this is just broken html for no good reason.

I think Facebook is (or was) probably rare exception in aggressive firing and not sure how they managed it. Most companies also require annual review to be in place before firing occurs. Typically hiring manager would avoid firing within first year because that usually looks very bad on them. Most true negatives don&#x27;t get fired until hiring manager changes or years pass by.

9245747,comment,9245467,9245467,0,0,wsxcde,,,"As seanwilson has pointed out already, academic papers are written to be intelligible to experts in the field. They&#x27;re not meant to be tutorials for practitioners. So you can easily get stuck if you&#x27;re reading a paper in a field in which you&#x27;re not an expert.<p>I also see a lot of useful tips here such as making notes, rewriting parts of the paper, and so forth. I think these ideas only work when you&#x27;re already getting something out of the paper. These tips are optimizers, they can help you get more out of a paper if you&#x27;re already somewhat conversant in the field.<p>In theory, if you&#x27;re not an expert, you can keep following the citation trail, read all the papers there, become an expert and finally read the paper you actually want to read. I don&#x27;t think this actually works. If you&#x27;re not a expert, the paper itself will seem like gibberish. You won&#x27;t know what citations are actually important and what citations were just pushed in to please a reviewer. And even if you somehow do, the citations themselves will be just as difficult to read.<p>So what are the solutions? First, seek out accessible papers. There are a lot of tutorials that get published in magazines like the CACM and IEEE Spectrum. These are written with an explicit goal of being accessible to a technical non-expert audience, so you will get something out of these articles. Maybe if you read one such article, you&#x27;ll get the big ideas in the article and <i>then</i> you can read the technical paper(s) that the article was based on. Since you already know the big ideas, the technical paper won&#x27;t seem so daunting. And maybe now, you can follow up on a few citations.<p>The general trick is to find alternate sources that simplify and explain the paper and then read the paper. Alternate sources can be tutorial articles, slides, blog posts, textbooks, talks and so on. This is actually how people learn to read papers in grad school. First, you go to few a masters level classes where the professors teach from papers rather than textbooks but don&#x27;t necessarily expect students to read and understand all the details in the paper. Next you go to a few seminar-type classes where professors and students discuss the nuances of a number of important papers. There&#x27;s a lot of non-obvious spoonfeeding that happens: the professors use their expertise to pick papers that important and accessible, they guide the discussion towards the important parts of the papers, they point out flaws and discuss methodologies, suggest projects for the students to implement and learn from, and so on. Over time, the students absorb these lessons by osmosis and become good at picking out and reading papers themselves.<p>If you&#x27;re not going to grad school yourself, you&#x27;ll have to recreate this process of slowly building expertise in a field by reading papers and comprehending them and trying to implement and recreate them. The key word is slowly because you&#x27;re not going to become an expert in a day, or even a month. You&#x27;ll have to keep going for a year or two and slowly you&#x27;ll feel like a blind man who can see more and more of his surroundings everyday.",1427003013

9245722,comment,9242379,9242724,0,0,ktsmith,,,"> From what I understand, the effect should be something like putting on glasses when you have myopia.<p>Yes and no. I&#x27;m myopic and have been since I was a small child I was also diagnosed with ADHD a year ago at age 35 and have been medicated for the last year.<p>Without glasses I&#x27;m basically blind. I can put them on and see, take them off and I&#x27;m back. I have control.<p>Without my medication if I go into a crowded room I am listening to a dozen conversations at once, giving each speaker the same amount of attention even though they are speaking at the same time and not to me. With my medication (40mg Vyvanse) I can go into a crowded room and hold a coherent conversation with someone and ignore the other conversations around me for the most part. I hear them but I can essentially choose to give most of my attention to whom I want.<p>Without the drugs I slip into hyper focus on things like a good book or a video game, completely losing track of time and actually not noticing when someone comes up and talks to me or interrupts me. This was really bad when I was a teenager and I&#x27;d read 700-800 pages when I should have been sleeping but I would have no idea how much time had passed. This still happens with the medication but it&#x27;s easier to break away. With the medication I have more control over what I&#x27;m focused on but it&#x27;s just a drug, if you are focused on the wrong thing it doesn&#x27;t care. That being said it&#x27;s not like people without ADHD describe where they lock into cleaning their house when they meant to be working. More willpower and impulse control are things I&#x27;d say I have when medicated.<p>I have more control but not complete control. I can&#x27;t turn it off until it runs its course unlike the glasses that I can take off any time I want. With glasses it&#x27;s simple, I can see or I can&#x27;t. With the drug it&#x27;s not simple at all. Things are better but it&#x27;s not a silver bullet and the wrong drug or the wrong dosage can have no effect or a negative effect.<p>I took ritalin initially but it just made me angry, sweaty and made my heart race with the bonus of terrible crashes in the early evening and no impact on the actual ADHD issues. With Adderall I needed to be working on what I wanted to before I took it because it kicked in fast and hard, it was effective to an extent but it wasn&#x27;t great. With Vyvanse I&#x27;m taking a similar drug but it&#x27;s uptake is slower and the comedown is slower I can ease into my work day, I tend to be more able to easily pick and choose which things I focus on and I&#x27;m much less impulsive. None of the issues are gone but like the glasses for my myopia the fog is lifted a bit with the effect of the amphetamines. Before I took them I just assumed I wasn&#x27;t as bright as everyone thought and that I need to work ten times harder to produce the same output. Since I&#x27;ve been medicated I feel normal for the most part and it&#x27;s allowed me to have a more normal work life balance as I don&#x27;t constantly feel like I&#x27;m behind or that I can&#x27;t get things done. This is largely because I&#x27;m more effective when I am working where as before I was distracted but didn&#x27;t really realize it or explained it away as multitasking.<p>> Vyvanse is an all-day dose, right? Did it affect your sleep?<p>It is an all day dose, 12-16 hours depending on the literature but I find it lasted about 6 on my first dosage and I get about 8 with 40mg. I can probably go up to 50mg but I&#x27;m happy with where I&#x27;m at. I don&#x27;t feel a big difference when I&#x27;m on the drug like I did initially but I&#x27;m still better able to handle the day and my tasks than I am without it. Normalcy was what I was really looking for. I don&#x27;t take it on the weekends which has helped a bit with tolerance and taking a 10 day break over the Christmas holiday really showed me how much tolerance was becoming an issue for me. An alternative to a bigger dose if it doesn&#x27;t last all day is to get an instant release secondary drug for the second half/end of the day. That way you can control when you take it and have a reasonable expectation of when it will wear off.<p>As far as sleep goes if you don&#x27;t take it too late in the day you are probably fine unless you have sleep problems to begin with, which of course are common for ADHD affected people. I am lucky in that my sleep issues were essentially conquered when I was between the ages of 8-10 since I could never sleep and my mother helped me figure out techniques to do so. Combinations of breathing, clearing my head, picturing myself descending into darkness etc. The only times I have trouble sleeping now are when I&#x27;m stressed, stay up too late, or stay up too late and try to sleep when I still have an obsession with a problem or task as I&#x27;m then unable to stop thinking about it. Ending my work day earlier helps prevent that.<p>The worst side effects for me are physical. I have to put on deodorant in the middle of the day and god forbid I forget to put on any at all. Dry mouth was absolutely awful until I started to build up a tolerance, now it&#x27;s not a huge issue. A few other minor things but nothing that I would stop using them over.",1427002372

If the problem&#x27;s modest, the rejections are temporary (e.g., re-try in a bit).

I&#x27;ll post the link here for a more inclusive discussion soon)<p>Now going back to your first question:<p><i>&quot;what do you answer when the obvious comparison to (and lack of industry adoption of) SCTP is put forward?&quot;</i><p>Oh... where to start.. OK. First off the comparison is not all that obvious. SCTP was never built for the mobile use case (4 way handshake??). There are some improvements over TCP (reliable, out-of-order message based delivery with multihoming are all good things), but there&#x27;s a fatal flaw that prevents any serious use of this protocol. It&#x27;s not TCP or UDP!! And there are umpteen middle-boxes on the internet who won&#x27;t let it through. That&#x27;s all you need to know to explain the lack of industry adoption of SCTP.<p>So we built our protocol on top of UDP (which we basically treat as a proxy for raw IP). Luckily for the mobile users, UDP based custom protocols are now well baked into various standard applications (DNS, VOIP etc.). A vast majority of middleboxes  support it and the trend is in the right direction -- every new middle box has to support UDP passthrough/NAT by default barring exceptional circumstances.<p>Now, how do we expect our new protocol to get adoption. The answer is, we don&#x27;t. We&#x27;re not just building a protocol. We&#x27;re building a turnkey service for mobile app developers. Our business case doesn&#x27;t involve convincing anyone of the technical superiority of the protocol. We simply sell a superior user experience with minimal developer effort. And you&#x27;ll learn as we get more open in the coming few weeks (wink, wink), it&#x27;s not at all a hard-sell :-)<p>Feel free to connect with me directly or just continue the discussion here if you have more questions. I&#x27;m always happy to engage skeptical observers ;-)",1427001548

I have many friends who already have pretty bad health problems, and they&#x27;re only in their 20s. I have no idea why this is happening, but I believe stress and hopelessness must be playing a large role. Kids can&#x27;t seem to afford to do anything in this city except abuse drugs and vandalize. The aboriginal population in this city is even worse off. I feel really bad for most of my friends and wish I could help. People think Vancouver is a really diverse city, but it is the most segregated city I have ever been to. The Chinese live in Richmond and West Van, the Indians live in Surrey, and the other ethnicities (Aboriginals, Caucasians, etc.) are getting squeezed in the middle. It&#x27;s quite sad.<p>Edit: Not just white people, I also mentioned aboriginals. I also have some chinese and indian friends who face the same issues, but I did not mention them due to the nature of the article. I grew up in the suburbs where the real problems seem to be much more obvious than a city-dweller who can safely live in his or her bubble and ignore the real issues. Don&#x27;t really give a fuck what most of you think. If you want to see unhappy people, take a drive out to Delta or Surrey.

As the return of Hong Kong to China approached, the influx of Chinese investment spiked.  It started in Vancouver, people who had been in the better parts of Vancouver and were of retirement age sold and moved out (basically the first wave) and those being bought out moved to places like the Okanogan, etc.<p>Then, single story buildings in Kits, for example, gave way to three+ story multi-use (commercial downstairs, residential upstairs) units.  Some of this is still happening around the city.  Where older 2-3 story condo buildings exist, some were vacated for building some more towers.<p>Funny this story shows up now.  It is something that has been happening for almost 20 years.<p>It is also amazing to me, given the beauty, the availability of technology, and the desirability, Vancouver never has become a tech hub.

There has traditionally been a lot of media (popular for hollywood filming), gaming, and smaller startups, but nothing that served as an anchor.<p>Vancouver and BC are probably at the top of my favorite places on the west coast, but the issues it has in technology, building an industry, and being affordable go back in time well before this simple blog post.<p>edit: typos",1427000494

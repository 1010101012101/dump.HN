This was back when applications were largely desktop based.<p>1.) See gap in market where the existing software is limited in functionality and difficult to use<p>2.) Develop software where everyone who uses it thinks it's amazing, easy to use, intuitive etc.<p>3.) Discover that although everyone loves it, it's really hard to market against the entrenched incumbents<p>4.) We got a salesperson in who after seeing the product agreed to being paid on an if-and-when the product succeeds basis<p>5.) Started looking for synergies and partnerships to help market it. Our salesperson had a lot of industry contacts and he used them to find out who the best people were to talk to at various organisations. He also managed to get introductions to some people. Other companies he found out who to approach just by doing some basic research, calling the company and asking around etc.<p>6.) Found an appropriate partner with huge customer base who was interested in providing it to their users<p>7.) They show interest, get NDA, legal agreement etc. drawn up, start negotiating<p>8.) Spend months demoing product, negotiating, graduating into meetings with increasingly senior staff etc.<p>9.) The main person we were dealing with is replaced with someone else, things go very quiet for a while<p>10.) After much deliberating be told that they've decided that the product wouldn't provide sufficient benefit for their users so they've decided not to go ahead<p>11.) Watch them launch a grossly inferior clone of your product a year later and win sweeping accolades<p>12.) Lawyer tells you initial legal agreement isn't worth paper it's written on<p>Then we considered open sourcing the product, but it turned out to be a nightmare because we'd used so many 3rd party components that it would've require huge amounts of work to get to a point where we could do so and we'd poured too much time and effort into it already.<p>As you can see, plenty of mistakes were made.

And I lucked out... completely escaped having to code over the phone.</i><p>I'm not trying to troll. However, I honestly do consider you landing a Google engineering internship/job with those school background (and zero coding experience outside of school up to that point) being pretty lucky. Consider this guy[1]. I believe he would've most likely gotten the internship had he gone through the same interview process as you. I know that's just my subjective opinion. However, the bottom line is he went through a very different (arguably harder) interview process than you did. It's harder in the sense you could have very well failed had you been asked to code over google doc + phone. The key factor here is this process that Google uses everyday to turn down countless competent but not extraordinary people - you did not have to go through it. That is the basis I deem you lucky.<p>There is a certain level of respect (among other befits) given to former or current Google engineers among hackers. And I would argue that is the case largely because of the very difficult process that they had to through to become one. I can totally understand why you had the sense of inferiority and insecurity of your coding abilities, having not gone through that process.<p>Of course none of this makes your point of everyone is good at different things and you should not beat yourself up any less significant. I agree with you on most other points. I'm also happy for you that you've overcome these self defeating thoughts and have proven to yourself. As some one else mentioned in the comments, the problem was you being you own toughest critic.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2384018"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2384018</a>",1302569366

2435221,comment,2434919,2434919,12,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Well the only successful strategy is to have a pitch that solves some sort of pain point that they are already having.<p>One of the hardest things to do is pitch something where the potential partner doesn't see a problem. And by 'a problem' here I mean 'is causing pain at the moment.'<p>You can tell a company until you are blue in the face that you will get them more leads, cut their operational costs, or streamline the experience the customers have when they deal with them. But unless the company 'doesn't have enough leads', 'has a problem with current operational costs', or 'has customers complaining about their interaction', all you will get is a thank you for sharing and nary a call back.<p>The fact is that the larger a business is, the more averse to changing they are. The reasoning is pretty simple, most larger businesses both don't know all of the variables that are going into their costs and customer experience, and they <i>know</i> they don't know all of the variables. Thus, if the system they are using is working for them (for their definition of working, not yours) then they won't change it. All they see is downside (change makes things worse), and little upside.<p>The only successful strategy that I have seen work with these folks is to find a way they can somehow canary your product with their own real data but without changing anything they currently have. That may take some extraordinary steps on your part to set up a completely parallel chain, but the payoff is that you can tell your future partner/customer, using their own data, how your change will help them and not hurt their existing system.",1302568862

Academic freedom is not condition-free; the tradition that demands ""academic freedom"" also says academics should stay out of what they ought to consider ""mere politics"". I read the original op-ed, and while this is selective quoting it is selective to prove my point: ""Mr. Walker’s assault on collective bargaining rights... Mr. Walker’s conduct has provoked a level of divisiveness and bitter partisan hostility the likes of which have not been seen in this state since at least the Vietnam War... Scott Walker is not Joe McCarthy. Their political convictions and the two moments in history are quite different. But [McCarthy comparisons made anyhow]...""<p>This is a very partisan piece. I could probably rewrite it without much work to be a much more neutral-POV historical piece with the same basic content, but as it stands now it is not neutral-POV. (In fact I agree with the underlying premise that the Republican party's priorities have shifted over time, but consider it uninteresting. All political parties shift over time; the further back in time you go, the less related to a modern party it is. Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, but... so what? It doesn't count as credit to the modern party, because they're only related via historical continuity, not by methods, persons, or platform. Democrats have shifted too, or should we pretend they are violating their core principles by not vigorously fighting for southern segregation?)<p>Academic freedom is the freedom to be free of mere politics in the pursuit of your academic studies. It is not a blank check to participate in political discourse from a privileged position above all others, with a unique defense not available to the rest of us. You have chosen to step out of your academic shield and function as a citizen.<p>That said, this is certainly a major overreaction from the Republican party. I don't see what they think they are going to get out of this. But this whole ""I'm a noble academic under attack"" is just BS, you simply <i>do not</i> get to run into a room, start lobbing ""McCarthyite!"", ""Radical!"", and a laundry list of other thinly-veiled plausibly-deniable political attacks worthy of any modern political speech writer around in a still-current political debate, and expect there to be no reaction from the political world.

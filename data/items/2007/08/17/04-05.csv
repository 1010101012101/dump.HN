43360,comment,43080,43080,0,0,Shooter,,,"I live in Oak Park and have an office downtown.<p>I'm working mostly on web apps and some business/finance services ideas (with software seasoning, of course.) I'm also an entrepreneur-in-residence for a small alternative asset fund that occasionally invests in SaaS start-ups.<p>I've went to one ""start-up event"" in Chicago since moving here. It was a waste of time. (The event was held at a bar and it was too loud to have any meaningful interaction with people. I was also hit up a few too many times for funding and/or free technical input by people that had ideas for things they couldn't share except to say their idea was ""like MySpace, only bigger!"")<p>;-)<p>I'd prefer a smaller, more informal meeting at a bookstore or something where the signal to noise ratio was a little better. And, even then, only if there was a compelling reason to take time away from coding...",1187326430

I mean Cantabrigians) like to believe otherwise. <p>If you don't feel that the Bay Area offers any advantage to your startup, you could probably be based almost anywhere. ",1187326334

43357,comment,42933,43033,0,0,yrashk,,,"I rarely experience long internet connection unavailability here in Ukraine (mostly due to thunderstorms or isp's hw problems), and even if I have such a problem, I always could use quite cheap CDMA 3G internet connection.\nSo Internet connection isn't a real problem here for doing startup. We have other problems over here :)",1187325994

43354,comment,42933,43280,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Parkland is at the southern edge of the first Bentley Belt, which extends from West Palm Beach to Boca. I've seen at least six Bentleys in Boca. The only other place I've ever seen one was curbside at LAX. I've never seen a Bentley anywhere in the Bay Area.<p>Fareed's comment is weird. Where is there a parking garage on Sand Hill Road?",1187325589
43353,comment,43074,43298,0,0,mencius,,,"In the rare cases that a programmer actually needs (dynamic) function composition, yes.<p>For very understandable reasons, most of the examples you see of higher-order FP languages tend to stress very intricate and elegant algorithms.  But what is 99.999% of the actual functional programming that is actually done in the world?  SQL and Web template transforms.  About as intricate as a brick.<p>The result of having these incredibly high-powered, high-strung thoroughbred FP languages is that no one even thinks of these mundane tasks as cases of functional programming.  But of course they are.  FP is the natural generalization of declarative programming.<p>The real tragedy of Haskell is that, if the people who designed Haskell had actually been working on, say, XML and XSLT, XML and XSLT would not suck nearly so much.<p>I repeat that in almost all cases, dynamic construction of functions is unnecessary and can be eliminated.  Otherwise, yes: write even more functions and pass around lists of function pointers.<p>But you're right that I could probably make the same point in a much less vitriolic way.  Blame acid reflux.",1187325091

43351,comment,43074,43318,0,0,mencius,,,"I wouldn't say it has to be usable by Joe Average Programmer, but if it's not - and it will obviously never be - it should have to explain why.  And it shouldn't be described in any context, whether paper, grant proposal, or university press release, as anything else.<p>C, for example, should never come within a mile of Joe Average Programmer.  But the world needs C, it needs the Linux kernel, etc, etc.  For other things, this is not so clear.<p>You have to be able to judge the prospects of research programs.  Otherwise, how do you separate the dry holes from the promising ones?  There is an infinite set of dry holes in the world, and any of them is happy to accept all the funding you can give it.",1187324292
43350,comment,43154,43154,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"A Really important set of ideas, but I wouldn't want to learn them from this book.  The author seems to think you can take two entire academic sub-specialties (History of Science, History of Technology) and cram their collective information into one trade paperback.<p>Societies are cagey and unpredictable about how (hell, <i>if</i>) they assimilate new technologies.  Studying those processes takes more intellectual commitment than you get from a book you might find on the ""Management"" rack by the checkout at Kinkos.<p>I'd recommend Thomas Misa's <i>Leonardo to the Internet</i> as a good starting point.",1187324141
43349,comment,43074,43288,0,0,mencius,,,"Also, when you're examining something that dubs itself ""science,"" pointing out a spot of routine dishonesty, however small and irrelevant, is hardly indicating a ""strawman.""  Shades of the [Curate's egg](<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate's_egg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate's_egg</a>).

43348,comment,43074,43288,0,0,mencius,,,"\nI think what you are describing is program verification, not proof-carrying code.  <p>In proof-carrying code, of course, the proposition you are proving may not be associated with the source code as an invariant.  But if it isn't, why isn't it?  It makes no sense to have one language for the invariant and another for the program.<p>For example, one use of PCC is to prove propositions about a bit of machine code, such as a packet filter.  When you create an environment that can state propositions about machine code, you have created a typed assembler, whether you like it or not.<p>Most leaders in the Netflix challenge are (at) CS departments because CS departments are full of smart programmers.",1187323912

What bothers me is that I think a field I admire is being mismanaged, not that it is driving the US (or any other country) bankrupt.  The US has worse problems than a little bit of science pork.",1187323603

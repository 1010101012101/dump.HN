I found HackerNews by accident and have been completely blown away and inspired ever since.<p>I love the startup news, the weekend projects that do cool stuff, and the overall ""ethic"" of the place.<p>I've done a few small projects recently,  I keep knocking them out in order to try and find that thing that will ""stick"" (or just to have a bit of fun).<p>Here are some recent ones:\nhttp://fstr.net\nhttp://onemorelike.com\nhttp://itsalldiet.com\nhttp://chesser.ca<p>I used to be a high school teacher.  Worked for five years in the United Kingdom teaching the little mytes.  It was wonderfully fulfilling.<p>I'd love to write a film one day.  Maybe I should spend my time doing that rather than all these little web projects .. they're fun too and I can see the results faster :)<p>alex dot chesser at gmail dot com",1280084079,

All these pathways are integrally connected, and analysis of sequence data is a great way to understand these connections.

alstonalvin12,0,1,0.0,0,0,"Alston Alvin (Harrogate, United Kingdom) makes films, photos and media art. With the use of appropriated materials which are borrowed from a day-to-day context, Alvin creates work in which a fascination with the clarity of content and an uncompromising attitude towards conceptual and minimal art can be found. The work is aloof and systematic and a cool and neutral imagery is used.<p>His films never shows the complete structure. This results in the fact that the artist can easily imagine an own interpretation without being hindered by the historical reality. By examining the ambiguity and origination via retakes and variations, he tries to increase the dynamic between audience and author by objectifying emotions and investigating the duality that develops through different interpretations.<p>His practice provides a useful set of allegorical tools for manoeuvring with a pseudo-minimalist approach in the world of film: these meticulously planned works resound and resonate with images culled from the fantastical realm of imagination. By manipulating the viewer to create confusion, he often creates several practically identical works, upon which thoughts that have apparently just been developed are manifested: notes are made and then crossed out again, ‘mistakes’ are repeated.\nhttp://contacttelephonenumbers.com/",1432727432,1453169432

It is rumored that if you are lucky you can spot him in his natural habitat at Sightglass Coffee.  Oh... and he loves to teach.  And tell stories.",1350866426,1450207814

fluffyjack,,5,0.0,6,2,"Twitter: @FluffyJack\nLinkedIn: http://lnkd.in/A_Qq5q<p>I was one of those kids that always pulled apart my toys instead of playing with them because I was way more interested in how they worked, and so when my family got a computer when I was about 7 or 8, I managed to convince my father to pull it apart with me and learn about all the pieces.<p>Then we got the internet, this was around the time I was turning 10. An amazing thing but nothing for me to pull apart, so I did the next best thing, I learnt how to build more of it myself. I searched and searched and learnt everything I could.<p>One day I&#x27;d reached a level where even though I was 12, I was able to go and get a professional job, for real money (very exciting at 12), creating and maintaining websites for a local studio that did websites for companies all over the world. I was hooked.<p>Around 14-15 I managed to enter a program at school where I could go work and complete a traineeship instead of participate in all of my classes. So I was introduced to Yari from Evolved Websites, and I started my traineeship. I learnt so much over the 19 months there, not just in terms of my technical skills, but my business skills also. The traineeship was a huge success too. Though the normal completion time was 24 months, I managed to fast-track the course side and complete it in 6 months.<p>Then I was on to leading a team. I joined VisionTech Digital and was quickly the lead developer on a large amount of projects, and asked to be the replacement for the Head Developer role that was shortly going to be opening. An amazing opportunity for someone that was only soon turning 17.<p>Those 7 years from when I first discovered the internet and it&#x27;s wonders to VisionTech Digital were a blur, they seemed to go by so quickly, but the past 4 have gone by even faster.<p>Start ups, government enterprises, amazing projects through my own business, and most recently finding the joy of teaching, screencasting, and writing books and blog posts. My career has been full of amazing things.",1381299250,1450207814

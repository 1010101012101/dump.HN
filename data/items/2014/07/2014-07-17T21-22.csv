Paid Clicks are clicks on Google ads which are up impressively but my observation is that there are a lot more of them in places than before. And lastly Google is paying nearly $900M/quarter (that is a 3.6B% annual run rate) to &quot;buy&quot; traffic to their properties. From that I conclude that Google&#x27;s &quot;specialness&quot; is losing its luster, and that results from other services are &quot;good enough&quot;. Doing this same math on Bing results and you will see that Microsoft is capturing the lion share of the value that Google is losing here. (and while Blekko is a search engine, we figured out earlier that you couldn&#x27;t buy traffic against a competitor willing to spend billions a quarter) The other observation is that this realistically, this can&#x27;t go on. Eventually Bing will be getting equal CPC with Google, and at that point trying to buy traffic or force the use of a particular browser that will only go to one search engine reliably, will make you less competitive than the more efficient guy down the street.

Both the Kub and Buk used self-propelled launchers developed by Ardalion Rastov. As a result of this visit the developers came to the conclusion that each Buk transporter erector launcher (TEL) should have its own fire control radar rather than being reliant on one central radar for the whole system as in Kub. The result of this move from TEL to transporter erector launcher and radar (TELAR) was a system able to engage multiple targets from multiple directions at the same time.</i>&quot;<p>If they have a vector to feed the fire control radar, and it then succeeds in acquiring the target, I would expect it to work.  Our anti-radiation missiles, plus the system&#x27;s missiles until the most recent one having semi-active homing (fire control radar must paint the target), put a premium on this sort of arrangement.<p>ADDED: I too am just learning these fine details; further down, as quoted by powertower in reply to this posting, the above ideal wasn&#x27;t implemented in full, there&#x27;s a normal 2-1 ratio of TELARs to TELs.  And think about the implications of the TELARs being obviously more expensive: the normal ratio is unlikely to be always observed, the maintenance demands of TELARs and a high TELAR to TEL ratio is going to be higher, etc. etc.",1405632246

This makes law enforcement look even safer. In fact, it makes it look safer than deskwork. This is either due to a methodological difference or due to the fact that LEOs tend to be young and healthy compared to deskworkers.

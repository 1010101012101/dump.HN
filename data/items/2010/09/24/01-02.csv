Also, I like the fact that it's on the front page.<p>So, the top 10 links could be the most yes-ed in a certain period, or the ratio yes/no ratio, or anything really..

The guess the idea there is that Google crawls these sites regularly, and it would find hundreds of inlinks to the hacker's site, giving him a boost in the rankings.<p>As far as PayPal and banks go, you're right, it would leave quite a trail if the hacker started sending money to his accounts from yours.  Instead, the hacker might log into your PayPal account to get additional info, such as the billing address for each of your credit cards (easy to find under Profile>Credit Cards).  He can log into your bank website to find the full credit card number or account numbers and routing numbers along with the billing address, and a nice history of purchases.

And later a VFO kit to drive the transmitter.  And a Q-Multiplier and a BFO for the 1927 Zenith radio from my dad so I could hear tones in CW.  Then, from scratch, when I got my General Class license, I built an AM modulator on a 14-inch steel chassis to get on AM.  Going almost digital, I built a two-tube 12as7 W9TO keyer for morse code for the above rig.  And an antenna system with two 45 foot poles about 180 feet apart to put up three dipoles.  And I cannot count the number of antennas that I have built over the years at my various residences.<p>Later, I built one of the second wave of the Altair computers, and actually had one or two consulting gigs from that.<p>And, to brag a little, I pointed my daughter, to a QST article on a code practice oscillator, and she built it with almost no supervision when she was in high school.<p>I built, from a kit, one or three of the amateur packet radio kits, and ran a radio BBS for too long a time.  (You see, the internet is just ham radio 2.0, but none of you get that fact, but i digress)<p>I built (strictly was architect for) a medical information system that gathered electrocardiograms from patients bedsides, transmitted them via telephone to a datacenter near Chicago, which returned an english-language report to the hosptial in ten minutes or less.

The idea of sendfile() is that you can send a physical address (probably something in the buffer cache) directly to a network adapter in a zero copy manner.  That's current impossible with a send()/write() to a file descriptor in Linux because you can't construct an SKB from a userspace address without forcefully pinning memory.  Pinning memory from userspace is a privileged operation.  OTOH, since buffer cache is not part of the memory of a process, you can obtain a physical address of it.<p>There's no magic in the kernel that avoids context switches.  If a kernel thread has to switch to another kernel thread, that's still a context switch.  And syscalls are ridiculously cheap on modern hardware.  sysenter is like < 100 cycles.<p>That said, there's no theoretical advantage to doing this via sendfile verses doing a send() from an mmap()'d file.  If Linux was smarter, it could realize instantly that the address given to send is file backed and could construct an SKB from the physical memory without pinning.<p>This is what the reference to a ""5 minute hack"" was vs. Rob Pike's claim that the interface exists to work around a problem in Linux.

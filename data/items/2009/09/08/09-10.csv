But the shown solution here, just changes the situation about information and leverage. Yes, everytime you have a disadvantage and put energy in changing to an advantageous situation, then you are in a better situation and get more out of a deal...\nNo, I am not worried about learning nothing out of this post. I am worried about the author. He just so much does not get the point. When I use mathematics to deal with the car dealer, my intention is NOT to get the information, NOT to gain leverage through dealing skills. I want to use my logical knowledge and skills to change the game from ""best dealer wins"" to ""most logical wins"".\nIt is really good to learn something about leverage. That is very nessesary for everybodies life, especially for us geeks, who are not naturally gifted in this area. But mathematics, too, is a strong tool, with different rules and different advantages.

810580,comment,810192,810415,0,0,trevelyan,,,"The Fed loans money to banks. Their unorthodox response to the financial crisis involved (1) creating new lending mechanisms allowing loans to be rolled over for longer periods of time, and (2) accepting illiquid securities as collateral instead of just things like Treasury Bonds.<p>But these are still short-term loans measured in months not years, and they are still taking collateral for them. Which makes it trivial for the Fed to shrink the money supply by however much it wants pretty much whenever it wants. It just stops rolling over the loans and takes the cash out of circulation as the banks give it back.<p>It is always possible that some banks will default on repayment and collapse. But that scenario isn't consistent with inflation because any significant collapse would be deflationary. And in a deflationary environment you want to be expanding the money supply.<p>Simply put, what the Fed giveth the Fed can taketh away.

As we're applying to YC this year, we've obviously been discussing if the age and varied experiences of our team has any positive/negative influence on our application.<p>In our previous lives in media production, it's all about youth and energy, and seems to becoming even more so, especially in advertising where ideas are often driven by an innate understanding of the power of technology, and how it can be harnessed to create and realise ideas in completely different ways. I know many over 40's colleagues who think computers are for Googling and email (you know who you are), and that's the limit of their technological skill. These people are almost speaking a different language to the 25 year old directors they're working with, who are breaking all the so called 'rules'.<p>At one point, many HNer's, after years of struggle and work on projects will become 'the old guys', and still drawing on their entrepreneurial skills and drive. Some will have made that Big Deal with all the $$$, but very many will still be pushing their next idea after a series of almost made it's.

810559,comment,809952,810381,0,0,neeson,,,"I've worked at two social ventures that had non-profits as clients (Web Networks, and most recently Urbantastic.com).<p>There emphatically is something wrong with non-profits.  Just because there are some excellent ones (Sturgeon's law applies) doesn't mean that the field at large isn't ill.<p>An anecdote: we had a meeting with a guy who worked at a large company with a philanthropic streak.  They provided, free of charge, a ""dashboard"" for planning, along with free training and tech support to any non-profit that wanted it (it cost considerable money otherwise).  It was simple but very powerful, allowing you to do sensitivity analyses on projections to determine which courses of action would result in the best returns - both monetary and any other metric you wanted to put in (i.e. the social goals of the project).<p>It was like he was selling popsicles at an ice rink.<p>We ran into a very similar issue with Urbantastic.  We had a web service that was very effective at getting small things done for non-profits: it's called micro-volunteering.  There's no supervision required, you just write down what you want and someone always did it.<p>When we founded Urbantastic we thought the challenge was going to be in getting skilled people to help out for free.  That was not a problem.  The problem was that we'd go up to non-profits and say: here's a machine where all you have to do is post your todo list, and people will cross off items for you.  For free.  And we never got uptake.<p>People lined out the door offering to help, and almost no one took them up on it.  Despite our offers to walk non-profits through it, and despite the recent funding cuts which meant that they needed all the help they could get.<p>I'm not saying that Urbantastic is perfect, but in our pilot cities this was overwhelmingly the result, and I still can't think of any incremental change that we could have done to get the non-profits engaged.  A big part of it was that most of them were still uncertain about the whole email thing.  It's not an exaggeration to say that some of them didn't know how to use a spreadsheet.<p>With our fancy web 2.0 ajaxy website, we felt like we were giving out iTunes gift cards to the lost tribes of Papua New Guinea.  They didn't value it because they weren't even close to being at the point where they could use it.<p>I care about social good - I wouldn't have founded a social venture if not.  And twice now I've been floored by the state of the non-profit world.  Again, 10% of them are brilliant, but the other 90%...  It's a big problem, and it's not going to get better by pretending that it's not there.  That world is amazingly backwards.  And it's saddening to see such important mandates being handled by such ineffective organizations.<p>My advice to anyone here planning on doing a social venture: drop backwards compatibility with the non-profit world.

But why?<p>- The ""exoskeleton"" metaphor for an N-list having its skeletal structure on the outside made me smile.<p>- I like the explanation of N-lists having a flat structure. Clean modules, with no dependencies. If your code can naturally fit this structure, it will be simpler. Alan Kay says that by inventing new <i>representations</i>, we make their users more intelligent (e.g. multiplication with Roman v.s. Arabic numerals). If your new representation enables its user to think in flat terms about what previously required nested or recursive structures, then you have done something great.<p>- These are playful and novel ways of looking at commonplace things. They evoke my conviction that gold is all around us; just a step or two off the path is something incredible.

Reddit&#x27;s full of horrible content, but it&#x27;s mostly on /r/atheism and /r/politics. the hate speech is there, but it&#x27;s more hidden than it&#x27;s ever been.

As a long-time user of both Amazon and AWS (respectively 1997 and 2006), their product management strategies seem very different to me.<p>A lot of Amazon stuff smacks of high-level micromanagement. E.g., their thoroughly failed phone. Or the disappointing feature mish-mash that is the Kindle app. On the positive side, the original Kindle was groundbreaking because of similar micromanagement.<p>But the AWS stuff feels much more bottom up to me. They start with some small, discreet notion. They trial it in private, getting feedback and evolving in careful response to users. When it&#x27;s solid enough, they open it up for everyone.

As a kid (let&#x27;s say circa 1982, definitely in the minicomputer era), I remember him talking about a problem at work: to do all their daily processing, they needed about 28 hours. A lot of the workload was reporting, so he asked managers what reports were no longer useful. Naturally, he was assured that every report was absolutely vital to proper functioning.<p>His solution was just to start dropping reports. If anybody complained, he&#x27;d put them back in the job list. A significant number of reports went unlamented, and soon the computer was able to complete its daily workload handily.<p>The lesson I took from this is that expressed desire is often very different than actual need, so separating the two can pay big dividends.

Both of these strategies require the content provider to adopt yet another &quot;standard&quot;, which takes time and money to make happen. IMOH, any of these tech company driven &quot;push-for-a-certain-tech&quot; is less likely to work, or at least not cost effective.<p>In contrast, the transition to &quot;mobile web first&quot; is already done in China, which I would argue has the largest monetizable mobile consumer market in the world (because it&#x27;s not only for hip young people. Most if not all of the grandma generation in China are getting on the internet for the 1st time, and only through WeChat on smartphones). Any user of the WeChat app knows the astonishing volume of contents shared within that social app, and all of them are mobile centric, actually it&#x27;s fair to say it&#x27;s &quot;mobile only&quot; (if you load the same URL of a shared article in WeChat on a desktop browser it&#x27;ll look aweful i.e. they are not responsive, and they don&#x27;t care). Yet, this transition happened not because of WeChat pushed all content providers to adopt a certain standard, but done spontaneously by each content provider, on their own to figure out what looks good on WeChat. The need to make &quot;mobile only&quot; content comes from the desire to reach the huge user base in WeChat, which, unlike facebook, is a &quot;mobile only&quot; app.<p>The tech for making mobile friendly webpages are there for years. I would argue the reason it&#x27;s not happening in the US is because of weak demand, not supply. If you have the sort of &quot;mobile only&quot; demand as seen in WeChat (Facebook is better positioned in that regard than Google), you&#x27;d see content providers switch to whatever suits them overnight.",1444240063

That is a very niche case.<p>Really, in almost all cases where JITs are effective it&#x27;s because of a language where you have to use a dynamic abstraction when it should have been a static one. The most common example being virtual dispatch that should have been compile time dispatch. Or even worse, string based dispatch in languages where values are semantically string dictionaries (JS, Python, Ruby). A JIT is unnecessary in languages with a proper distinction between compile time abstractions and run time constructs. Names should be a purely compile time affair. Instantiating an abstraction should happen at compile time in most cases. There goes 99% of the damage that a JIT tries to undo, along with a lot of the damage that a JIT <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> undo. Sadly most languages lack these abilities. Rust is one of the few languages that has a sensible story for this, at least for the special case of type abstraction, traits, and lambdas.

For example, in an attempt to get to know Windows better, I recently asked the only top Windows-using dev I know what his environment and tooling look like. &quot;Oh, I switched to a Mac last year,&quot; he said. That migration is typical, and suggests that people who care about computers will continue preferentially switching from Windows to Mac and Linux.<p>A similar thing happened a few years ago when Subversion was still the dominant version control system and SourceForge was still the main repository for open-source projects. It was 2008, and I was at a dinner seated between the CEO of CollabNet, principal corporate backer of Subversion, and the outgoing CEO of SourceForge. I asked the CollabNet CEO what he thought about Git. His view was that there was a winner among open-source VCSes, and that winner was Subversion. Then I asked the SourceForge CEO if he&#x27;d heard of GitHub. He had, but was unconcerned, since SourceForge was was cutting million-dollar deals while GitHub was still relatively small, having launched only in April of that year.<p>Now, I was in Y Combinator at the time, so I definitely shared pg&#x27;s &quot;myopia&quot;, and at that point basically everyone I knew had switched to Git and GitHub. I thought to myself, &quot;These guys have already lost, and they don&#x27;t even know there&#x27;s a war.&quot; And indeed things have played out exactly as I expected, with Git and GitHub crushing Subversion and SourceForge into irrelevance.<p>So you see that there&#x27;s a fundamental asymmetry between what pg sees in front of him and what you might see. Being in YC means you&#x27;re &quot;living in the future&quot; [1], which is why pg writes with such confidence about the direction things are going.

For instance:<p>>The ideological challenge mounted by the other great alternative to liberalism, communism, was far more serious. Marx, speaking Hegel&#x27;s language, asserted that liberal society contained a fundamental contradiction that could not be resolved within its context, that between capital and labor, and this contradiction has constituted the chief accusation against liberalism ever since. But surely, the class issue has actually been successfully resolved in the West. As Kojève (among others) noted, the egalitarianism of modern America represents the essential achievement of the classless society envisioned by Marx. This is not to say that there are not rich people and poor people in the United States, or that the gap between them has not grown in recent years. But the root causes of economic inequality do not have to do with the underlying legal and social structure of our society, which remains fundamentally egalitarian and moderately redistributionist, so much as with the cultural and social characteristics of the groups that make it up, which are in turn the historical legacy of premodern conditions. Thus black poverty in the United States is not the inherent product of liberalism, but is rather the &quot;legacy of slavery and racism&quot; which persisted long after the formal abolition of slavery.<p>This sounds blithe, silly, and downright ahistorical by today&#x27;s standards.  26 years were apparently all it took for class conflict, in fact <i>world-wide</i> class conflict, to re-emerge alongside imperial and religious conflicts, environmental challenges, and energy shortages as a chief driving factor in a conflicted, multipolar geopolitics.  Meanwhile, the &quot;democratic, egalitarian&quot; West appears to have ended up neither democratic (in the sense that state policy reflects the will of the common people as expressed through such devices as polls, elections, and social movements) nor egalitarian (in the sense of income and wealth inequality, in the sense of social gaps between races and classes, and even in the sense of applying human-rights laws universally).<p>>The end of history will be a very sad time. The struggle for recognition, the willingness to risk one&#x27;s life for a purely abstract goal, the worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring, courage, imagination, and idealism, will be replaced by economic calculation, the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns, and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands. In the post-historical period there will be neither art nor philosophy, just the perpetual caretaking of the museum of human history. I can feel in myself, and see in others around me, a powerful nostalgia for the time when history existed. Such nostalgia, in fact, will continue to fuel competition and conflict even in the post-historical world for some time to come. Even though I recognize its inevitability, I have the most ambivalent feelings for the civilization that has been created in Europe since 1945, with its north Atlantic and Asian offshoots. Perhaps this very prospect of centuries of boredom at the end of history will serve to get history started once again.<p>It really must be asked what Fukuyama was thinking when he actually published this nonsense.<p>The only possible &quot;End of History&quot; would be the extermination of the human race.",1444239094

I&#x27;d add that experienced agents also know how to spot potential issues when touring houses, what work you should and shouldn&#x27;t do to prepare your house for sale, and can provide a network of providers to help you close your purchase/sale (lenders, contractors, landscapers, etc.).<p>I thought I&#x27;d also mention the company I work for, HomeLight (www.homelight.com). We&#x27;re trying to provide transparency into real estate agent performance to help people select agents that will actually provide value to them during a property purchase or sale.<p>There are over 2 million licensed real estate agents in the US. The average number of transactions per agent per year is under 2. Good agents can provide tremendous value, but finding those gems is really tough, especially when agents, until recently, tried very hard to hide their past performance. Also, a lot of markets don&#x27;t really require a lot of work from agents. In SF for instance, you can list almost any property and get above asking price for it after one weekend of open houses, but that doesn&#x27;t hold for other markets, which can make the 5%-7% commission feel like you&#x27;re being cheated.<p>When my wife and I were looking for houses in the East Bay (Oakland and Berkeley mostly) our agent was average.  She would send us property dumps for the entire city of oakland (we had no interest in east oakland, but she kept sending us properties there) and she didn&#x27;t respect the way I wanted to communicate with her (email...she called me all the time), and she didn&#x27;t provide great guidance on what we should offer on properties we were interested in.  But, she did a good job showing us properties and pointing out issues, figuring out all the open house times, communicating with other agents, introducing us to a great loan officer, etc.  I /could/ have contacted all the listing agents for the 10 properties we wanted to see a week myself, but she did that for us, which saved a ton of time.<p>Agents that are &quot;bad&quot; are ones that won&#x27;t return your calls, don&#x27;t listen to your needs, try to show you properties you aren&#x27;t interested in, don&#x27;t know the area you are interested in well, can&#x27;t identify when a roof probably needs to be replaced or if someone just painted over the black mold in the basement corner, hooks you up with crappy loan officers, etc. And unfortunately, there&#x27;s a TON of those agents out there.",1444237550

Blocking those 3rd parties on web pages is what actually contributes best to make web pages load much faster.<p>I loaded the URL of the AMP-based web page posted somewhere here[1], and it does look like the ability to clearly distinguish and filter network requests based on whether they are 3rd-party is removed.<p>I would like more details about this, because so far my understanding is that 3rd parties are becoming obfuscated with this new method of delivering web pages.

In doing so, it makes a distinction between characters, elements, codepoints and graphemes.  At certain points, you may want one or the other of these.<p>When asking for the length of a string, what are you really asking for?  The number of characters?  Visible characters, or unicode combining characters?  What if it&#x27;s really the number of bytes in the string you need?  Perl 6 makes it easy to determine all of these things in a clear manner.  In doing so, it becomes obvious that &quot;length&quot; is ambiguous due to both its common specific role in other languages, and it&#x27;s meaning when viewed in the context of these different needs.<p>If you want individual characters, you split the string, if you want access to the underlying data, you call .encode to get the encoding you expect, or you stick it into a Buf or Blob type if you don&#x27;t actually need string semantics.<p>(Corrections welcome, I could be wrong at any number of points above).",1444237288

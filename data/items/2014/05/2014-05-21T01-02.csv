If they built their tools correctly<p><i>If</i> they built their tools correctly. I think that&#x27;s a big assumption. We know for a fact that the NSA has infiltrated and/or influenced various organizations to knowingly implement vulnerabilities in commonly used protocols so that systems that use those protocols can be exploited later. This was all over the news. Some experts even speculate that this may be how the Heartbleed bug originated. Considering the fact that OpenSSL has been around for a long time and no one discovered the vulnerability until very recently seriously brings to question how much faith can be placed in systems like GnuPG and OTR.<p>Again, consider who you are up against: the NSA has the capability to tap underwater cables, intercept shipments of routers to plant bugs on them, to force airplanes of foreign presidents to land on allied territory so they can be searched for a fugitive, and who knows what else. And that is the &quot;who knows what else&quot; part that should worry you. We are against an enemy of unknown power and influence, and it is silly to expect technology -- <i>any</i> technology -- to provide sufficient protection.

7776319,comment,7775487,7776082,5,0,eigenvector,,,"Both rent and home prices are driven by supply and demand, that is, what the market can bear.<p>In both cases supply is the same, but for ownership, the market is global. You can live on the moon and own property in Vancouver. The price of Vancouver property is constrained only by the limits of how much foreign capital is available to be safely parked in Canadian real estate, not by the population of Vancouver. As you can imagine there is considered more of the former than the latter.<p>However, the market for rentals is constrained by the number and salaries of people who actually live in Vancouver. Nobody rents an apartment in a city in which they don&#x27;t actually reside. You can&#x27;t charge $3,000/month for an apartment in Vancouver because no one will be able to afford it. In Vancouver a junior engineer earns $60,000/year.<p>Vancouver salaries aren&#x27;t higher than anywhere else in Canada (in fact they&#x27;re lower than Calgary and Toronto, both of which have cheaper housing, and about on par with Montreal which has MUCH cheaper housing), so despite the crazy property market this keeps rents down.<p>SF&#x27;s crazy rents are driven by the tech industry salaries that are much higher than anywhere else in the country (or in the world for that matter).",1400637058

7776317,comment,7775308,7775862,11,0,jerf,,,"Erlang&#x27;s &quot;let it die&quot; philosophy is surrounded by other support structures that make it work. It works better in that language than it would in most others. I do find that my production-quality Erlang code does somewhat often have to catch errors so it can properly log them, though the relatively recent addition of line numbers is a big help there. (Prior to that, you could end up with a &quot;badmatch&quot; identified only by what function it occurred in. This is not necessarily a problem, but when you see dozens of them per minute filling up your log it made it tricky to figure out what was really going wrong so you could fix it. Even with line numbers it&#x27;s not always quite enough, though.)<p>In Go, for that code snippet you&#x27;d be looking at one of two possibilities, looking at it a bit more generalized than just the specific Open call since I think this is a philosophical question rather than a literal &quot;what does this code literally do?&quot; question. Either &quot;file&quot; would come back nil, in which case the return line would crash with a nil access, or you&#x27;d get something that would fail to work correctly. <i>Probably</i> the zero value for the type, but only <i>probably</i>; it would be syntactically legal for the function to half-construct a value and end up returning it to you, expecting you to pick up the err value and know not to use it. I actually don&#x27;t know what the common practice is here... obviously when I put it that way, returning a half-constructed object is not a good idea, but I don&#x27;t know in practice whether many things do that, because you always should deal with the error. There is at least one call in the shipped library that can return both an error and a result, which is the Reader interface&#x27;s Read call: <a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/io/#Reader"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/io/#Reader</a> It is legal (though not mandatory) to both return that some bytes were read, and that we&#x27;ve hit the EOF. (It <i>is</i> mandatory that the next call will return only EOF as the error in that case.)<p>While Erlang and Go are at the opposite ends of the spectrum on error handling, and I think it&#x27;s easy for either side to look at the other and think it&#x27;s crazy, but I also think they&#x27;re <i>both</i> solid ways of operating; in practice I find I produce similar levels of reliability with similar amounts of cognitive effort in both regimes. It&#x27;s one of those cases where the extremes are viable, and it&#x27;s the options in the middle that suck. In Erlang, you don&#x27;t worry much about errors, the system is built around that, and the fact that &quot;=&quot; is not assignment but pattern-match-and-bind makes:<p><pre><code>    {ok, Value} = complicated_function()\n</code></pre>\ninto an efficient assertion that the function correctly completed and the correct thing is in Value xor I crashed. It makes a naive (in the computer science sense, not the insulting one), &quot;sweep it under the rug&quot; approach to errors do what it should. This is a huge positive... making simple code that anyone can write do the right thing is a very powerful approach, and failing to consider this is one of the Great Software Engineering Sins, in my opinion.<p>On the Go side, it mostly sticks errors in your face and makes damn sure you do something sensible with them. It&#x27;s not perfect (it&#x27;s possible to ignore an err... &quot;someday&quot; I&#x27;d like to build a go vet extension to help check for this), but it mostly doesn&#x27;t let you ignore errors <i>and</i> write idiomatic code. Sure, it&#x27;s more code than it needs to be, but, then, Erlang is not exactly a master of concision either (the number of multi-ugly-line Erlang functions that I could collapse down to one line of Haskell, sigh). This also works.<p>Partisans can have fruitful debates about the pros and cons of each. What <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> work is making it so that naively-written code ends up <i>completely</i> ignoring errors and just then just skipping dealing with them. That said, honestly, nowadays I can only really think of C that still works that way, though. Most everything else has some solution to this problem (exceptions, mostly).",1400636984

Somebody visiting Jersey City went to &quot;New Jersey&quot; colloquially.<p>Actually, I take it back, people who don&#x27;t know NYC well &quot;know&quot; that Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx are &quot;places in NYC&quot; even if they aren&#x27;t quite sure what they are, I&#x27;m not sure Queens registers for most people, and Staten Island, even though it&#x27;s geographically one of the largest parts of the city, may as well not even exist. People picture Manhattan in their heads though and that&#x27;s about all they ever visit. Some people might confuse the name Yonkers as part of NYC because it&#x27;s kind of a funny name like Brooklyn or Bronx and they&#x27;ve probably heard it on NYC area TV shows and movies. But nobody outside of the NYC area will visit White Plains, Paterson or Newark and claim &quot;I went to New York City&quot;.<p>Meanwhile, people who visit Palo Alto <i>definitely</i> say &quot;I visited San Francisco&quot;. But I do agree with other comments that people don&#x27;t usually conflate San Jose or Oakland with San Francisco.<p>It&#x27;s the colloquial semantics of place names that I&#x27;m referring to. It&#x27;s a little bit like how &quot;Asian&quot; means either East Asian, or East Asian + South Asian depending on your dialect of English, but nobody who ever visited Aermenia or Cyprus ever claimed they &quot;visited Asia&quot;. Or people who visit Egypt visited &quot;the middle East&quot; when really they visited Africa.<p>Part of it is name recognition. If I&#x27;m not from the Bay Area, &quot;Belmont&quot; or &quot;Millbrae&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean anything to me or to the people I&#x27;m talking to, even if they&#x27;re clearly distinct places well outside of SF. The identity of SF has subsumed those other areas, at least in the geographic knowledge base that people from outside the area walk around with.<p>Most people <i>know</i> Jersey City is obviously not NYC. But most people from outside of the D.C. area couldn&#x27;t pick out Annandale nor does it have any meaning to them. So people just say &quot;I went to D.C.&quot;<p>This has some embarrassing and sometimes hilarious side-effects for out of towners. Like for example, somebody visiting San Francisco proper, knows that they have a buddy that lives near there (because in a past conversation his buddy said &quot;I live in SF&quot; because it was easier than saying &quot;I live in Emerald Hills&quot; and doesn&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s not immediately convenient for them or their buddy to just hop on a street car and meet up for a quick Coffee.<p>Or I know a company from the West Coast that set up shop in &quot;D.C.&quot; expecting it to be convenient to their Government customers, only to find out that none of their customers would come to their office since it was a 2 hour drive in traffic from the actual customer locations out in the larger Metropolitan area.",1400636348

You know you had your GE, IBM, Ford, I don&#x27;t know P&G, big serious companies that wear ties and white shirts. And you make a parody of them and becomes kind of obvious. Oh look &quot;Big Brother Inside&quot; logo for Intel. Ok clearly a parody.<p>However, I feel, there is this movement toward lightheartedness and humor in the new style of PR. Google is the prototypical company here. Bright childish colors. &quot;Oh look the rainbow! Blue, green, red colorful beach balls in every office!&quot;. That was their initial image. &quot;We are just big kids playing and building cool stuff&quot;.  Or say, April 1st comes, and here is Google making fun of their products. Releasing something like &quot;Google Fiber over Toilet Plumbing&quot; (get it, get it, fiber, toilet, ..., make sure to tweet it!).  Something like that.  So that is all jolly good, except that by using lightheartedness and parody as a standard PR tool, now it is not easily differentiated from other parody out there. Maybe environmentalists make a site about Google&#x27;s Fiber Toilet Plumbing. Now it is kind of harder to tell the difference.<p>Anyway, this is too much drivel. Not defending or taking sides, just pointing out what seems like an interesting pattern developing.",1400634053

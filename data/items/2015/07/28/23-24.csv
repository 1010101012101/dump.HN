In no way has there been any capitulation. In fact Microsoft leads the space. Does Apple have universal apps ?<p>The value of universal apps are debatable, but let&#x27;s say Microsoft does rule that space.  When $some_crazy_high_percentage of delivered phones are android and iOS, the market has spoken - people dont&#x27; care about running the same app on their phone and their desktop.  Even if Microsoft successfully makes a shift to offering their app development platform on iOS and Android, they&#x27;re now doing that from a position of weakness.  There&#x27;s certainly money to be made there, but its the difference between a serf and a lord.  Microsoft is the lord of its own domain when they control the phone platform, and is a serf in Apple&#x27;s.<p>But then you switch to something else:<p>> And does Apple or Google have an equivalent to Azure&#x27;s strategic analytics plays ? No.<p>But that&#x27;s an entirely different rodeo than the whole thrust of the article, which is the declining dominance of the PC and Microsoft&#x27;s lack of success in the mobile space.  Apple doesn&#x27;t even care about the enterprise computing space from that perspective, and Amazon absolutely does want to offer those analytics - it&#x27;s an entirely different set of competitors.<p>So, sure, yes, Microsoft is doing cool stuff with Azure, which is great, maybe that&#x27;s the future of the business.

No user experience or a sub-optimal user experience.  If we do what PPK is proposing that leaves us with poor user experiences and maybe no user experience if we need a feature that is only available on native.<p>Having a web platform that can compete with native apps mitigates the problems and abuses common with companies that have monopolies.  If they have competition they can&#x27;t screw over their developers and user.<p>30% is an onerous tax.  It&#x27;s one thing if that is a marketing or referral fee.  But if a developer is creating an app to use with their own platform / service they are most likely going to provide a download link from their site.  They don&#x27;t need any promotion or directory.  Apple isn&#x27;t providing any value.  They are creating an artificial barrier and blocking other companies from serving their users just so they can get a cut of the action.<p>I&#x27;ve been using ES6 functionality like &quot;yield&quot; in my backend node.js code and am loving it.

And one of the strictest rules there was that you were not allowed in the water until you&#x27;d passed the swimming competency test (and you had to pass it again every single year), and the main swimming test was that you had to swim laps in their roped-off section of the lake without pausing until you&#x27;d swum for at least half of the distance across the lake (thus ensuring that if you were to be dropped smack dab into the middle of the lake, you could swim out). We had to do this even though most scouts never even had a reason to go outside the small roped-off section and thus would never be required to actually swim to shore.<p>I also remember one year doing a lifeguarding merit badge where we did various things like tread water for an excessively long period of time, practice towing other people to shore, and even a bit where we had to jump into the water fully clothed in jeans and a long-sleeved shirt and learn how to float regardless (basically by inflating our shirt with air). That stuff was <i>hard</i>. Also one bit where we started on shore, fully-clothed including jeans, socks, laced-up boots, etc, and had to ditch as much clothing as possible and run into the water within an extremely short period of time (the idea being if we saw someone drowning, we had to be able to get in the water to effect a rescue as fast as possible).<p>[1] New England has a habit of calling large bodies of water &quot;ponds&quot; even though most other places would call them lakes",1438126596

The inefficiencies and borderline corrupt nature of hollywood&#x27;s film production spending habits are mind blowing. I would get into detail but it’s a bit long of a yarn for a HN comment.<p>Healthcare has some systemic similarities I suppose, but the case I&#x27;ll make is that there&#x27;s a historic precedent for digital disruption of creative media with books, increasingly TV, and particularly music. We think of online piracy as the main disruptor of the record business, but the record industry also lost a lot of power when artists no longer needed a major label&#x27;s advance check or marketing to record & distribute a successful album.

There was formal knowledge that unlocking late would lead to a flight abort, and a recent event had occurred where the unlock was late.  Add to this copilot workload increases between flights, the fact that training wasn&#x27;t done in the suits and equipment worn on the real flight or under the g and vibration loads in the flight, and the result was the copilot unlocked the feather early leading to the loss of the vehicle. As usual, not a single failure, but a chain of smaller failures - lack of formalization of knowledge, lack of training in the operational environment, recent events, pressure to avoid an abort, and you get an overcompensation.",1438125216

Grandis claims a 6F2 size which is indeed comparable to DRAM.<p>>>  people who make the exact same claims about RRAM as you quote for MRAM, which 3d-xpoint appears to be.<p>> At least the xpoint incarnation still seems to be slower than DRAM according to that article, while MRAM is being offered as SRAM/battery-backed DRAM drop-in replacement.<p>Right, the product they are claiming they will manufacture next year is slower than DRAM and less dense than flash.  (Frustratingly I couldn&#x27;t find a reference for if they are talking about latency or throughput when they say &quot;slower&quot;; it makes a big difference for which applications will be hurt by the performance mismatch).<p>However, there doesn&#x27;t appear (yet) to be a fundamental reason why resistive ram must always be slower than DRAM, nor a fundamental reason why they couldn&#x27;t do MLC tricks with it, so you can&#x27;t say all RRAM will be slower than DRAM and less dense than NAND.",1438125132

MICRO SWITCH Sensing and Control revolutionized the keyboard industry in 1968 by introducing the first solid state keyboard using the Hall effect. For the first time, a Hall effect sensing element and its associated electronics were combined in a single integrated circuit.

The basic premise is that it defines a secure OS as something that requires an add-on security framework (resulting in additional complexity), and concludes that OpenBSD is not secure because it doesn&#x27;t meet this definition. It&#x27;s a pretty disingenuous argument. The author&#x27;s knowledge and understanding of OpenBSD are also quite obviously shallow, given the examples he uses to make his points.<p>Yes, the approach of security through simple correctness is indeed difficult, but OpenBSD has been doing a pretty darn good job at it for a very long time. At the very least, its highly successful track record demonstrates how their approach has been more effective than any added security framework approach, in the real world. And other operating systems have come around to adopting OpenBSD&#x27;s security features and techniques, rather than the other way around.",1399337951

The benchmark&#x27;s purpose is to educate the community on the potential benefits of a LXC based technology (primarily from a Cloudy perspective) by providing a set of data points with full disclosure as to the means / methods used to perform tests and collect results. I expect any organization, group or individual considering actions as a result will perform their own validation to assert the technology choice is beneficial for their consumption prior to adoption. I believe this criteria is met in the current publication and therefore the results will stand on their own.<p>As to test configuration variations such as those stated above (disable KSM, boot by clone, etc.) -- I believe additional data sets collected via variations or other benchmarks are key to obtaining a well rounded understanding of the factors / benefits involved in this space and I encourage the community to create / publish such results. As an example I would like to gauge the impact of the various KVM guest cache modes and docker LXC storage providers which I believe are fair game to test and add as a variation to the existing benchmark.<p>Should you wish to iterate other configurations / requirements you believe are worth exploring I can make note of them for the next round of tests (time permitting). In addition I&#x27;m more than happy to document the instructions to setup and perform these tests so that others can run it themselves. I gladly welcome additional tests and data points from the broader community at large.",1399337420

7702264,comment,7698403,7700831,8,0,zoomerang,,,"I agree very strongly, but I can understand the opposite viewpoint.<p>For me, I like to write HTML in HTML. While I&#x27;m primarily a backend programmer these days, I&#x27;ve spend a considerable portion of my career writing HTML, so I&#x27;m very familiar and fluent in it.<p>As such, to me, writing HTML as HTML with annotations for data bindings and loop is a much better approach. Anything else just gets in the way of my workflow. AngularJS is the only tool I&#x27;ve used so far that really nails this properly. (At least since Zope)<p>However a lot of developers aren&#x27;t HTML guys. They think in code, and to them HTML == DOM == a Tree structure. So it makes sense for them to be returning a tree.<p>I quite religiously think the latter is the wrong approach and results in less maintainable code. Instead of having a single template with the entire page clearly laid out, you end up with small snippets of HTML rendered all over the place.<p>This becomes even more jarring when you&#x27;re working with designers that aren&#x27;t coders. I manage a team of 7, and Using HTML-based templates means that my designer can write fluent AngularJS templates without developers having to do a thing. The alternative is for the designer to mock something up, and then for developers to cut it up into tiny little pieces and rewrite it in whatever DOM abstraction is the flavour of the month. Try reskinning a site made up of hundreds of small snippets of DOM vs a few complete HTML templates - the latter is far easier.<p>Some developers like to write Dom in Javascript because they know Javascript and don&#x27;t want to learn another language.<p>To me, the idea that templates are bad because somebody doesn&#x27;t want to learn another language just reeks of anti intellectual bullshit. Angular template aren&#x27;t difficult.<p>I&#x27;ll finish off this post by adding that I <i>much</i> prefer reactive code over imperative observables or dirty-checking, but Angular templates work so ridiculously well it&#x27;d feel like a step backwards moving to another framework that didn&#x27;t have them. My dream toolchain would use something similar to Angular templates, with FRP code behind the scenes.<p>tl;dr To somebody used to writing HTML, building a page by emitting snippets of DOM inside Javascript is about as annoying as trying to write Javascript by emitting snippets of code in XML.",1399337204

As a simplistic example, consider the original mario game. When a runner would want to split, the game screen would display the text 1-1 with a black background roughly at the center area of the screen. With this information, I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to determine when to split by scanning in the rough area for a picture similar to the what you would expect at this spot. I know that in practice this is possible to do since I have (just for fun) written a similar program for pokemon games when I wanted to EV train on an emulator. It would scan for the edge block of the tall grass (since all grass looks the same), and then turn around and scan for the edge again. When the screen went black, I knew I was entering a battle, so I was start scanning where the wild pokemon&#x27;s name was and the program would be able to decide if I wanted to kill it or if I wanted to run (so I can keep count of the EVs I&#x27;ve gotten) The main issue with that program is that it couldn&#x27;t tell shinies apart, so maybe over night I could have lost a shiny without ever knowing.<p>Anyway, long post short, I think it would be possible to monitor the live video and determine when to split based off information that can be stored in some kinda downloadable database (or some way to preset all the different required split information).",1399337170

They are both in the top 10, and the U.S. actually has a higher median income, but the subjective difference to me is huge. Not in the mean or median, but in the general feeling that there is far less poverty. Even bad parts of Copenhagen are nothing like the bad parts of Atlanta (same goes for other cities I&#x27;ve lived in, like Chicago and Los Angeles). You don&#x27;t really have to watch yourself nearly as much. When I lived in Atlanta, you needed a lot of fairly specific knowledge about which areas of the city were safe, sometimes even which <i>specific streets</i> were okay to walk on at night. And the unsafe ones were unsafe in the &quot;people get mugged here daily&quot; sort of way, whereas the Copenhagen unsafe neighborhoods are more like &quot;someone was mugged here 6 weeks ago and it&#x27;s still in the news&quot;. Homeless people are much more rare; things like people living in trailer parks are also very rare. There is no safety problem biking 10km alone at 4am half-drunk; in fact it is not too uncommon to do so. And even poor people seem to have fairly normal lives, not <i>that</i> different from mine. They rent non-squalid apartments, send their kids to ok schools, have good medical care, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how to quantify that subjective feeling of the general level feeling wealthier, but one guess might be to look at Nth-percentile incomes for your choice of lower bound N. The U.S. has a higher median income than Denmark. But a bound that <i>half</i> the people fall below (N=50) doesn&#x27;t give you strong guarantees. How do their 10th-percentile incomes compare? I.e. what is the lower bound that >90% of Americans meet, vs. the lower bound that >90% of Danes meet? IIRC, it&#x27;s considerably higher in Denmark, which might explain why it subjectively feels wealthier to me—the income $x where you can assume &quot;probably almost everyone makes at least $x&quot; for some reasonable choice of &quot;almost everyone&quot; (80%, 90%, 95%, somewhere in that range) is higher.",1399336977

Tightly coupled (cohesive?) within each pair, but as a unit are reusable together elsewhere in the front-end app.<p>So I can agree in theory, and see where my ideas have wandered close to the path that React takes.

If your opponent knows you can&#x27;t shoot left, you are done for. Applies to war, business and arguments.<p>6)Shake hands very firmly. Especially with women. It&#x27;s respect.<p>7)Keep the gas at a half tank. Emergencies happen.<p>8)Family is more important to most people than their own life, or yours.<p>9)Use tools, learn to fix your own car.<p>10)Learn to cook well. Flip burgers and steaks ONCE and ONLY ONCE. DO NOT squeeze the juices out of them.<p>11)DO NOT become addicted. Do not develop alcoholism or start smoking. Enjoy these things, sure, but chemical addiction is horrible.<p>12) Set goals every 6 months. Write them down, tell your family about them, post them on your fridge.<p>Nothing here has anything to do with ambition.

Such a language is dead simple: you only have four kinds of expressions: numbers, additions, functions, and function calls.<p>Write a parser and a printer (a pretty printer would be best, but you don&#x27;t have to).  Use one to test the other.  Then write an interpreter, who takes an expression as input, evaluates it, and spits out a number.<p>The whole thing should fit in a couple hundred lines, tops.  The only real difficulty is to evaluate function calls.  The rest is only a matter of catching runtime errors (like trying to add a number and a function).

Such backwards thinking!<p>Heck, some of Apple&#x27;s &quot;proprietary connectors&quot; even become the standard, such as Mini DisplayPort.",1399334802

Perhaps the Swedes, like the Germans, practice good lane discipline and stick to the right until they need to overtake.<p>I think this 2+1 wouldn&#x27;t work in the US because (in my experience) very few people use the lanes correctly and they just distribute themselves evenly across all lanes, regardless of speed. That strategy does, indeed, lead to bottlenecks when the number of lanes reduces.",1399334797

But Apple is also hyper-focused on user-experience and design, which is a huge strength.<p>What I really don&#x27;t get is his claim that Facebook will be one of the top 2 tech companies? Really?! Why? Because they are riding the cloud wave?!! FB, the social network itself is so ready for disruption that I believe it&#x27;ll be dethroned just as easily as MySpace was.

I&#x27;m still stopped at almost every airport, border, or other &quot;random&quot; check. Whilst I won&#x27;t assert that there&#x27;s necessarily bigotry at work, there&#x27;s certainly a selection bias.

7702102,comment,7701628,7701628,3,0,robot,,,"I switched to Apple products completely, because the UI and experience is _much_ better. In my opinion Google is the company whose UI really sucks. For example try Google Maps today. It is a great product but when you click on any point of interest, you will get a large popup on the left, that covers 1/3rd of the screen. You won&#x27;t be able to see the map anymore. The same kind of dysfunctional UI philosophy is spread everywhere in Google products (see how the dial pad on Android vanilla UI is made smaller, and hard to use, for sake of writing more details to confuse the user). See how google contacts on an Android phone contain all contacts thrice, and mostly irrelevant because they are imported from gmail.<p>I know it sounds a bit one-dimensional to discuss who will be the &quot;top tech company&quot; with UI or user experience differences, but that is ultimately what made me pick one product line instead of the other.",1399334699

It&#x27;s not until very, very recently that game companies started to think that the original source and assets for a game would have enough value to be worth the cost of archiving. Even games from the PlayStation 2 era routinely have to be rewritten from scratch with new assets when re-released on later consoles.<p>In my experience, most of the game source code that survived from the early years of personal computing is for games written in BASIC, which would have been distributed as source. There&#x27;s a few exceptions like for Jordan Mechner&#x27;s games, but that just goes hand-in-hand with his famously detailed records of his development process.",1399334612

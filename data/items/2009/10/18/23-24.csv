I have had occasional wrist pain or numbness for twenty years, most of which turns out to emanate from a nerve pinch in my <i>shoulders</i>. Doing certain shoulder exercises makes the wrists feel great. Again: find a doctor or a PT who will give you specific advice.<p>Don't think that gadgets and gimmicks are the whole solution.

Go through each type of value and cross-index it across all the structures it needs to be accessed by.<p>Then write intersectable queries into the structures to express a complex gameplay question like ""Find all the enemy actors that are near mission objective X"" as the composable ""Find positions between boundaries A,B,C,D, that belong to actors of the enemy type, where A,B,C,D are some distance relative to the position of the objective entity with the name of X."" Since you aren't writing a generic all-purpose database, this isn't a <i>hard</i> problem. It's just time-consuming to nail down the data model that captures all of it.<p>I think you will agree that a fancy language isn't necessary to implement such an approach to game programming. Done that way, data mostly ends up being pointers.<p>If your game is processing-light(which with today's desktop hardware primarily means avoiding 3d computation), you don't need a fast language: I'm most familiar with doing game code for Python and Flash and they can do just fine on modestly-sized datasets too.",1255908812

About a year ago the discomfort was so intense that I switched hands so that now I use my left hand both at work and at home.

There are no trends and there isn't really a disregard for trend following. There's more an apathy toward the entire concept of trends. There's also not much self-obsession, either: My friends who wear obnoxiously oversized glasses usually bought them with other friends and wear them because they think it's funny. It's not a nonconforming thing and it's not a trend. If anything it's more of an impulse.",1255907595

889036,story,,,4,1,pavlov,"Ask HN: Review my ""design-oriented"" open source app (iPhone, Mac, Maemo)",,"To sublimate my unhealthy interest in smartphone software development, I've been working on a cross-platform multimedia app for a while now. Apple recently approved the iPhone version, and thus I figured this might be a suitable junction to beg for your opinions concerning the software.<p><pre><code>  The website:    http://lacquer.fi/2020\n\n  App on iTunes:  http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=334032238&mt=8\n  (It's free)\n</code></pre>\nOriginally I had some noble goals for this project: I wanted to build something useful for that famous ""next one billion users"" for whom the mobile phone will be the first computer. I wanted the software to be as minimalistic as possible, language-independent, and with an attractive interface. It would be designed for voice and graphics communication, rather than text. The documents should be highly compressed to enable transmission over crap mobile networks in the 3rd world. The code should also be lightweight and portable enough that it would run on the hundreds of millions of cheapo Symbian devices that Nokia is going to dump onto the African and Latin American markets soon.<p>I still haven't got around to doing a Symbian version (their SDK is pretty terrible all around, it's not something I want to spoil my evenings with)... And overall, I don't have much hopes of being able to do something to benefit those mysterious 3rd world users.<p>Still, I've got this pile of C code written; it mostly does what I originally set out to do; and now I'd like to make it into something that could be useful to the ordinary smartphone user today, rather than leaving the code to rot in some open source graveyard.<p>For more general utility, I wrote a ""cloud sync"" feature using Google App Engine. I'm pretty happy with the way it works on the iPhone. There's a website that offers access to the files as well, although it's quite minimalistic so far. (The Mac OS X application also has the built-in cloud connection. I haven't yet got around to updating the Maemo version with this feature -- anyway Maemo has a regular user-accessible file system, so online storage is not quite as necessary as on the iPhone.)<p>I guess what I'm now looking for is some feedback on overall direction. Maybe stuff like:<p>Does this app make any sense to you?\nAre its design parameters too limiting / ill-chosen?\nIs there any point in open-sourcing this kind of software?\nIs there perhaps something else that I could be building on this base instead, rather than sticking to the original idea?<p>Thanks for reading :)",1255907451

889025,comment,888643,888811,0,0,dkarl,,,"Very good points.  Since C++ is a good match for the way people are taught to think about programming, it's obvious that anything good programmers can't easily and consistently get right is the fault of the language.  With Haskell, you can't rule out unfamiliarity as the cause of any difficulties until you're already heavily invested in it.  Most people really have no basis for challenging the statement that Haskell is perfectly suited for game programming in the hands of a competent programmer.<p>Pragmatically, for the OP, I think it's safe to say that C++ and Haskell are both very challenging languages that take a long time to master.  The advantage of C++ is that there's ample evidence of its suitability for various domains.  The advantage of Haskell is that you'll learn a different way of programming.  The decisive factor may be whether it's your own money on the line.",1255907136

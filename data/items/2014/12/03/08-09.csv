8692592,comment,8691688,8691688,0,0,informatimago,,,"1984: MacOS GUI programming in (Lisa)Pascal, Lightspeed Pascal came the following year, and the MPW with Object Pascal a couple of years later.<p>OOP wasn&#x27;t very common yet, but when you look at the Mac Toolbox, you can see that it is definitely an OO design (eg. Window is a subclass of GrafPort and Dialog is a subclass of Window, see also the various Control and &quot;subclasses&quot;).<p>Therefore I would say that 1984 with the Macintosh starts modern programming age, marked with high level programming languages (the Mac Toolbox was written in Pascal! (only the Mac OS was written in Assembler, and of course Quickdraw was first debugged in Pascal, and then hand-optimized in assembler), and with object oriented programming.<p>Of course, when people started to write Mac applications in C, it was a set-back, but then NeXTSTEP made a big advance with Objective-C and OpenStep (now Cocoa, ie. MacOSX and iOS), which allowed the creation of the web (and therefore Javascript).<p>But really, OpenStep (Cocoa) is just a cleaned up version of the Mac Toolbox (which was itself a dumbed down version of Smalltalk developped in the 70&#x27;s at the PARC).<p>So I would say that not much new since then.  We&#x27;ve heard of some experiment where some program was run on the Amazon cloud to debug programs on a cost of $8/bug (which assumedly is cheaper than a programmer debugging), but we don&#x27;t have those kind of AI aids integrated in our tool boxes.  We&#x27;ve heard of some automatic proof systems (Coq, ACL, etc), but management wouldn&#x27;t let us invest in their use (perhaps rightly so, they seem to be as much time sinks as programming itself).<p>We ARE still programming like it wask 1984!!! (unfortunately).<p>Well, not exactly, ok.   Now compilations are instantaneous instead of taking hours, and just try to write your next program on a 512x342 pixel screen (or just a 80x25 terminal) with no Internet access for the documentation (all the documentation printed in thick bibles on your knees! (Imagine Android documentation printed!)).<p>Ok, there&#x27;s some progress still: nowadays I use Common Lisp and emacs all the time (for a pale rendition of the 80&#x27;s Lisp Machines), and people often use Ruby or python, or even Java, which are run with garbage collectors.  So this invention from 1959 finally takes ground, helping us concentrate on solving users&#x27; problem instead of managing computing resources.",1417597173

But there definitely is a problem that there is almost no way to properly restructure a bloated government organization when it is underperforming, and somehow that should be addressed.<p>The public is unhappy with Thames Water, a private company, but no amount of private sector competition pixie dust is going to make another company start digging up London&#x27;s streets to provide a re-organization.<p>It&#x27;s not a problem with governments, it&#x27;s a problem with natural monopolies and that&#x27;s difficult to solve.

I think Disneyworld has an attraction that uses this.<p>3) It is highly likely that an arbitrary sound sample will sound different on playback if you add e.g. an 80kHz tone, as harmonic distortion of amplifiers and speakers tends to increase with frequency.

The end result of this might be a high-speed rail system, or something else entirely.<p>The value of programs with ambitious targets is that they will provide real world solutions forged out of necessity. Sometimes these will lead to new areas of industrial production, sometimes find that all they will need is a bunch of ducktape.<p>To make great leaps, we usually cannot put the technology before the end. It all starts with a great goal. Von Braun was obsessed with rocket engines because he wanted to explore the space. Heisenberg did not invent linear algebra (he was not aware it already existed, I think) because he was obsessed of numbers but because there was a specific physics problem he wanted to solve and he intuitively grasped he needed new tools to calculate the stuff he needed to calculate.

Technically speaking, its implementing a type-safe query (think SQL) language on top of them, but the difference is very minimal in practice.<p>What this does is allow for certain operations to automatically be run in parallel.  If you wanted to add 1 to every element in an array, you could do that with with Linq:<p><pre><code>    IEnumerable<int> numbers = new List<int>() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };\n    var newList = from num in numbers.AsParallel()\n                    select (x => x+1);\n    </code></pre>\nbut by adding &quot;.asParallel()&quot; to the chain:<p><pre><code>    var newList = from num in numbers.AsParallel()\n                    select (x => x+1);\n</code></pre>\nyour code is automatically run on each element in a parallel fashion and the runtime handles marshalling it all into a queue for processing... or however it does it&#x27;s magic.<p>The MSDN document on the way it does it is quite clear: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd997399(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd997399(v=vs.110).a...</a> - describing many linq operations as &#x27;delightfully parallel&#x27;.<p>I personally love Linq. To me it feels like using a Functional Relational Mapping system when combined with Linq-To-SQL, and the same semantics can be used to create a reactive programming model similar to what is intended with kefir.js and Akka ( <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx</a> )<p>The idea itself isn&#x27;t new, Perl 6 has something like this planned for trivial cases like  for (1..10) { $_ = $_ +1; }<p>----<p>I don&#x27;t know the full story, but for me the significance of open sourcing this code is that it will potentially encourage forks and extensions that allow running stuff upon GPGPUs or other massively parallel architectures while still using Linq style syntax.<p>TL;DR:\nWith Linq, Anything that implements iEnumerable (lists, arrays, streams, etc) can be made to automatically support all sorts of nifty transforms.

The taxi driver picked us up from the airport and took us to our hotel 30 minutes away. He was pretty helpful and seemed to know the area quite well. Then we got to our destination and he demanded that I pay cash, even though the taxi had a touchscreen terminal behind the front passenger seat for paying with card.<p>He said that he needed the $55 fare in cash because he needs to take some money home and it is midnight. I told him that I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable, he was apologetic, explained he needed the money and so, to save trouble, I went into the hotel and got out the cash for him because I just got off a few hours plane ride, I didn&#x27;t want to deal with this nonsense at this time of night.<p>I told the man behind the desk at the hotel and he explained that it happens all of the time. He said a lot of the drivers pocket the cash for themselves which is why they demand cash. He then advised us not to hire taxis and to use a hotel recommended private driver service that is the same cost (no doubt a nice referral fee for them). An ulterior motive there, but I don&#x27;t doubt that this happens all of the time.<p>This experience, other experiences from colleagues and friends as well as online paints a picture of a pretty broken and corrupt taxi system in Los Angeles especially. While I am not a big fan of Uber (ethically) I do like the idea of ridesharing and the rating system. If Lyft, Uber and other companies were operating here, perhaps things would be different.",1417594154

2851246,comment,2850904,2850904,4,0,Jarred,,,"I think this is_fb_employee variable is to check if they should be running the internal testing version of Facebook. Facebook has a subdomain which, in their offices everyone is redirected to. It's something like 'preview.facebook.com'. It houses the latest testing build of Facebook. This way all the employees are testing Facebook just by being on it, and they have other people testing their new builds for short periods of time (~2 weeks). Chances are, the server checks if the user is at an IP of a Facebook office, and that's the only condition where this is true. This would make sense because if they just redirect users to Facebook.com in their offices to preview.facebook.com, then nearly anyone could do it. This would also help prevent leaking of new features as well, because employees wouldn't be able to access them outside of Facebook.<p>They mention this in the Facebook Effect (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Facebook-Effect-Inside-Company-Connecting/dp/1439102112"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Facebook-Effect-Inside-Company-Connect...</a>).

2851236,comment,2850572,2850847,4,0,technoslut,,,"I've never taken this as Gruber believing the patent system is working well. A post from DF:<p><a href=""http://daringfireball.net/2010/03/this_apple_htc_patent_thing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/2010/03/this_apple_htc_patent_thin...</a><p>From the post: ""But for software the system, in practice, is undeniably broken. Theres an argument to be made that software is inherently different than other fields of invention, different in such a way that patents should not apply  or, should apply for a significantly shorter period of time before expiring. You cant (or at least shouldnt) be able to patent mathematics, and there are good arguments that programming is a branch of mathematics. But because software patents are granted, concede at least for the moment that certain kinds of software innovations ought to be patentable. Even with that in mind, clearly the U.S. Patent Office is and has granted patents for things which ought not be patentable. Not just silly frivolous things, but patents that have been granted for concepts alone, rather than specific innovative implementations of said concepts. Ideas in the abstract, rather than implementations of ideas.""<p>To me this sounds like a well-reasoned post that acknowledges the patent system is broken. I'm not sure if I would validate software patents at all but it's a far better system than what's in place now.<p>Also: ""To me, user interface patents are hand-in-hand with business method patents as examples of things which, no matter how innovative or original, ought not be patentable. Theyre idea patents.""<p>This is just something to point out that this where Gruber and Apple do seem to stray paths. Gruber may be an Apple fan but it doesn't go beyond all reason.<p>Regarding the situation with Google, I do think he is mostly right. I would have liked to have seen Google publicly lobby against software patents in general, with the consumer and Congress. That is not the path they chose. Instead they chose to become an investor in Intellectual Ventures and play the game of mutually assured destruction with MS, Apple & Oracle. Doing so makes them equally complicit in the process. Winning the battle against these three companies does not protect the indie dev. It only serves Google's end which means their motives are ultimately selfish. If they can play selfish why can't others who currently have the law on their side?",1312570450

Yes, maybe it makes one capable of writing a perfect program even, in the sense that it may even be mathematically proven correct; yet that's absolutely irrelevant outside of the realm of the theoretical. The basics of this nature are well-documented everywhere already, and it's not necessary to know all of them before doing more integrated exercises; full applications that people actually want to use.</i><p>You state that theory is diverged from practice, which in general is one of the most rotten notions people commonly hold, but the very same sentence seems to indicate that you don't really understand the theory you're talking about - you first equate Computer Science to mathematical proofs of correctness, then you imply that proofs of correctness are useless in practice, both statements being equally unwise. Your users still want to use fast software, solve hard problems, do not like to find bugs in your programs and your colleagues still would prefer that the code you are writing is easy to understand and easy to maintain. It is not possible to go long-term about solving hard problems (writing fast programs being one of them) without knowing or inventing the necessary theory, and without lots of experimenting as well, for which there is ample historical evidence in the history of science and engineering.<p>I don't care if you do book exercises, katas from the web, or invent your own toy project, but you have to practice writing programs, including small programs, involving some actual domain problems (theory!) to be a really good programmer. A few times when doing recruitment for my company I asked the candidates to prepare a small program for me, first time a program extracting links from a given url, the other time a small TCP chat server and client. Such a program can be elegantly written in a page or two of code, yet 90% of people can not write a bug-free program of this kind at all, not to mention achieving elegance (ease of understanding the code + good maintainability + good performance). They of course won't cope well with a larger program and/or larger problem, they are just used to patch things together in a chaotic way until they find a combination that works. This tactic doesn't scale well to hard problems unfortunately.<p>The only reasonable function of the analogy to Karate is that calling an exercise a ""Kata"" might be motivating for some people and sounds nice. Carrying it any further doesn't have any meaning. For one, 90% of the time you spend doing Karate is doing various kind of exercises and you get in a ""real fight"" a few times in a lifetime perhaps. No wonder martial arts that spend those 90% of the time on something more related to the situation you want to be prepared for actually get you better prepared for the situation. I also doubt the goal of Karate is beating people up in the street or in some fancy cage. In programming the exercises are just an addition to performing your real work, which is probably done almost every day anyway.",1312569484

Also, I have heard that Rails changes very fastly sometimes, so you may have difficulty catching up if you are a student (but at the same time, it has a livelier community, so that might be a plus -- check out <a href=""http://rubyweekly.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubyweekly.com/</a> ).<p>With Django, the core structure is simpler to understand, and you may continue working on your site after a few week's break easily. This is a little bit like the difference bt. Python and Ruby/Perl; I find Ruby/Perl more flexible (there is more than one way to do it), Python to be more strict (there is usually a single best way).<p>To sum up, I don't think it would make a difference if you were a full time developer working on the project every day, but for a student, occasionally working on a project, Django would be easier to get accustomed to, after not working on the project for a given time.<p>PS: I suggest you to take a look at Flask (Python) or Sinatra (Ruby) too; they might be easier to start with. Your experience with Flask would help with Django, too (or vice versa).",1312568728

I graduated last month. 9 interviews in the last 2 months. Finally landed a job, so I guess I can talk about how the other 8 went. Honestly its not so simple as you describe. There is definitely a supply-demand dynamic at work. Too much supply. Literally too many sailors and too few ships. Every university of repute ( Courant, UCB, MIT, Princeton, Stanford, UChicago, CMU, Columbia, Cornell ) and the 2nd-tiers ( UMich, Rutgers, UToronto, Baruch, Boston ) together graduate some 1500+ solid quants each year. That's 1500 people with a Financial Mathematics Masters, in addition to C++ programming, whether via BSCS, MSCS, or PhD ( several PhDs in my pgm ), with typically another 1-2 graduate degrees thrown into the cocktail! I used to think with 3 Masters I was in a good spot, but I realized I was actually in the middle/bottom tranche. There are many people ( some 25% of class ) seeking a Masters in Financial Math who already have either a Physics PhDs or Statistics PhDs or ofcourse pure Math PhDs ( aka God ). So they get this science/math PhD, realize academia sucks, then head for a financial math degree, then get a C++ certificate ( there's a mini industry minting money off of ""C++ certification for quant"") and then show up at the interview. A first-timer ( ie. one with just Financial Math & C++ ) has zero chance. These are not the only ones you are competing with. You also have insiders ( people with MBAs and CFAs and 5 years at an IB/PE ) who may not do very well on the C++ or the math, but their experience at a trading desk gives them a huge edge. IBs surely cannot absorb 1500 bodies year after year. So the interviews are super-technical and nobody wants you to succeed.  I wouldn't say I was stupid/obnoxious at 8 of the 9. 2 of them said I was ""clearly overqualified and would quit in 3 months out of boredom"" ! Some others were ""not a right fit"" type ( too much programming not enough math or vice-versa) , but there were a few hedge funds where I felt Boy this is my dream job but they were technically off-the-charts. The questions were goddamn hard. And the math was hard. Write C++ code for pricing a barrier option on an instrument with some specified parameters where the volatility is stochastic ( ie. use Heston's volatility model to price a barrier call. ) Now that's not the sort of stuff you look forward to without a stiff one. A classmate was asked to walk through a SABR and a GARCH and asked to explain in detail which one would be a better fit for a certain class of fx bonds and why. While the programs give you a good overview of everything, that is also their flaw - they give you detailed knowledge of nothing. So you have to have mandatory side projects to succeed. I had written a few thousand lines of java to price condors & written an optimizer over the holidays, so that was what got me my job. But even that wasn't sufficient.  Walk me through your code. Did your model actually make you money ? How much money ? Did you make money because of your model or because of the view of the instrument ? I mean that stupid side project suddenly took a life of its own and became like a real production system which should jump through all sorts of hoops and make money from day 1! There was much more relief than happiness when it was all over and I got the job.<p>Bottomline, right now there are simply too many good candidates and too few positions. You have to be really really smart and lucky. Stupidity and obnoxiousness is a very trivial filter - most will get past that pretty soon. What happens after that is what counts.",1312568505

Obviously, out-group behaviour can be more easily identified and punished. This is useful for reducing out-group behaviour you disapprove of, e.g. crime, but bad because it discourages out-group behaviour you approve of, e.g. radical political opinions.<p>One example: I would love to be able to give karma scores to other drivers, and I bet insurance companies would be interested too.",1312567868

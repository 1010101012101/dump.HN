If you read his writings on hackers then he's really describing himself and imagining that everyone is like this.  Here he's saying that the 'geek persona' is another ESR-type.<p>I found this very annoying when I read the hacker description in The New Hackers Dictionary because there were thinks that I just wasn't:<p>1. Learn to write your native language well.<p>2. Read science fiction. Go to science fiction conventions.<p>3. Train in a martial-arts form.<p>4. Study an actual meditation discipline.<p>5. Develop an analytical ear for music.<p>6. Learn to play some musical instrument well, or how to sing.<p>7. Develop your appreciation of puns and wordplay.<p>So 1, 5 and 7 are things that I'm in agreement with.

I've worked in polyglot environments where the decision to use multiple languages and platforms was a complete disaster.

Sometimes these caps can be horrendously expensive compared to the real cost of the bandwidth (i.e. high markup).<p>But there's also quite a few ISPs with no unreasonable bandwidth caps. I have the choice to use one of these ISPs instead (and I do).<p>Same deal with net neutrality. If non-neutral ISPs pop up, then you can be sure that neutral ones will too. There's no better selling point than ""we're cheaper than those guys"".<p>I think the government is right not to mess with a well functioning market when there's not even a problem yet. I'm not so keen on them trying to spin non-neutral practices into a good thing (this may just be the article sensationalising).",1290006133

So even if Amazon or Google declared bankruptcy tomorrow Adsense and Amazon Marketplace would go on.

Or, maybe not, if you think 3.5 million is enough, you already have all the exemption you need.  I could see something pushing it a little higher in cases of early death and a life insurance payout.<p>That makes sense.<p>You know what doesn't make sense, though?  Complaining about a ""death tax"" on the one hand while complaining about the budget deficit at the same time, yet maintaining that you're the political party of hard work, bootstrapping, blah blah.  If you care about the latter two, don't spend your time going to the mat for Paris Hilton.  If you consult some charts about income distribution in this country, you can conclude that the <i>vaaaaaaaaast</i> majority of the revenue collected under this tax comes from very large estates where the children would be set for life with 10% of it, and they're doing very very well with 3.5Mil + 45% of the rest.<p>Exceptional cases may be worthy of exceptions under the law, but that doesn't change whether the law makes sense in the general case.",1290006041

CLR.<p>That being said, having to rewrite an entire engine because of the underbellies of the CLR seems to be dubious, especially in the case of a development environment that purports to make life easier for the developer.<p>I have nothing against C#, one of the trading frameworks I use uses it exclusively (Ninjatrader) and it's pretty nice.  It's just that I would hate to have invested weeks/months into a software project, using what I imagine would be tried-and-true software techniques, and then have to rework them to get over the particulars of the implementation.<p>That being said, I guess all languages have similar problems.  For example, when I was working on a backend server back in 2001, we found that our product was ""leaking"" memory on HP-UX, even though none of memory leak detectors found any problems, and the memory leak problem didn't occur in Solaris, AIX and Windows (we had a cross-platform server).  It turns out on high-load systems, our app was allocating a bunch of small strings all over the place, and the base memory allocator for HP-UX was causing memory fragmentation over time.  By switching to another memory allocator that handled this situation, it fixed the problem.<p>I guess there aren't any C/C++ books that I've come across that say ""don't allocate a millions of small memory blocks because your memory might fragment, even though you free them properly.""  So maybe I misspoke, I guess to some degree it does manifest itself in all implementations of languages.",1319816011

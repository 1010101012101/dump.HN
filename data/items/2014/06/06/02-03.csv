7855995,comment,7852717,7855537,1,0,pdonis,,,"<i>> Whatever you pay to your brokerage, you pay on top of the spread. The spread is what you pay to place a market order.</i><p>I agree with you for the case of a &quot;buy and hold&quot; investor buying or selling actual shares of stock (with the proviso that the overhead to such an investor is already pretty low since he doesn&#x27;t execute many trades, so the gain to him from something like HFT decreasing the bid-ask spread is small). But as I noted, many, probably most, &quot;buy and hold&quot; investors hold mutual funds through 401k&#x27;s, not individual stocks.<p>For example, I have a 401k. I don&#x27;t place market orders. I rebalance my portfolio every so often, which, after a lot of intermediate steps, might result in some mutual fund manager placing a market order. But I don&#x27;t see any of the direct costs associated with that, whether it&#x27;s paying the spread or anything else. I only see the net overhead of the mutual fund as a whole. (And, as I noted, for a lot of 401k&#x27;s, like mine, I don&#x27;t even see that, because the 401k mutual funds are no-load.)",1402023407

7855988,comment,7853578,7854640,1,0,falcolas,,,"> Sure, and if you&#x27;re going to do that, you might as well use protobufs which is going to be much faster/more lightweight.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for fast, you&#x27;re probably not looking at an interpreted language. Plus, there are faster protocols out there than protobufs, if speed is all you care about.<p>>  It means the compiler can verify your types are correct and the runtime can verify your messages have all the fields they&#x27;ll need.<p>Again, the OP was referring to using protobufs in Ruby. Type safety and the compiler are not high priorities when writing in Ruby.<p>> Sure, but if you do, you have to handle the version-management code at the application level, manually, where it&#x27;s really easy to make mistakes.<p>That depends on your application&#x27;s requirements - for most cases, Python/Ruby/Javascript make it very easy to add or deprecate fields in dictionaries/hashes without having to explicitly worry about versions. Just specifying default values when requesting a key. And since you can ignore hash pairs with even less effort, deprecating portions of an API are simple.<p>Protobuffers definitely has its place, I&#x27;m just not convinced that place is in dynamically typed languages like Python, Ruby or Javascript.",1402023238

It&#x27;s definitely more efficient for one agency to manage the entire police force for a city, rather than having multiple.

You can see where that would lead, given how trigger happy some cops are already. Imagine 5 different fire trucks arriving at a scene. They wouldn&#x27;t have enough space to do their job with all the others around them. Keeping track of the people at both of these scenes is also nearly impossible with several forces (and it&#x27;s critical to know who&#x27;s in the burning building or who&#x27;s armed in a crime scene.)",1402022680

There have been about 50 million reports, each of which reports on a run of the unit tests for a single distribution on one version of Perl on one platform.<p>----<p>P6 has a written &quot;spec&quot;. The spec is not &quot;formal&quot; in the normal formal mathematical sense of the word formal. (The same appears to be true for RubySpec.) We&#x27;re not talking IBM formally verifying Z here!<p>The P6 spec inlines the &quot;spectests&quot; associated with that section/paragraph/sentence of the spec. About 35K so far.<p>So, aiui, if one squints a little, the Perl 6 spec/test approach is, perhaps very roughly speaking, equivalent to RubySpec/RSpec.<p>Aiui there are specific versions of RubySpec corresponding to specific versions of Ruby. (It looked like the latest RubySpec is 2.1, ie not covering the latest Ruby version. But that doesn&#x27;t sound right. Perhaps I misunderstood what I&#x27;ve seen/read.)<p>The P6 spec, and its tests, aren&#x27;t yet structured to serve for multiple versions. (Talk of dealing with this surfaced recently. And of course it&#x27;s all git backed so spec versions can be correlated with spectest versions with Rakudo versions.) The spec and tests are in some cases years <i>ahead</i> of the latest Rakudo, the main P6 implementation, and in some cases behind. (The word &quot;spec&quot;, in regard to the P6 spec, seems to mean both specification and speculation!)<p>----<p>P6 ecosystem testing is currently very ad hoc. But P6ers are in the process of integrating P6 distribution (module) management with CPAN, which will mean that user contributed P6 distributions/modules will get the same automated testing that I described above for P5.<p>----<p>Finally, to confuse everyone, there are not only multiple implementations of P5 and P6, but also a P5 re-implementation written in... P6.<p>Tobias Leich is developing &quot;v5&quot;, a P5 compiler written in P6. (Well, for now it&#x27;s written in NQP, a small subset of P6, but he has said he plans to switch to full P6 this year.) The test suite for v5 is a fork of the production P5 test suite.<p>Hope someone found this info interesting. :)",1402022341

Firstly, I don&#x27;t see the circle in the following:<p>- SolutionX puts lots of CO2 into the atmosphere compared to alternatives, and would be extremely uneconomic if we included in the cost/unitSolutionX the cost required to extract that CO2 from the atmosphere again.<p>- Lots of CO2 in the atmosphere is bad<p>-> SolutionX is either bad because it&#x27;s uneconomic, or bad because it leads to lots of CO2 in the atmosphere.<p>-> We shouldn&#x27;t use SolutionX until some factors change such that SolutionX is better than alternatives, rather than worse.<p>That&#x27;s linear reasoning. If you want to change one of the underlying assumptions, namely that it&#x27;s expensive to capture CO2 (and convert it back to carbon in this case... where at least the CO2 is coming from a concentrated point which reduces the cost of the process) then it&#x27;s still linear reasoning with a slightly different result.<p>For it to become circular there would have to be some step where we said &quot;If we had SolutionX it would be cheap and easy to get CO2 from the atmosphere and turn it back into carbon, but we don&#x27;t have SolutionX because the methods of getting CO2 from the atmosphere without SolutionX are expensive so SolutionX is dirty&quot;.<p>That, interestingly, was used and is used as an argument against solar cells (e.g. solar cells made on power grids consume energy that may have a large CO2 loading). But it&#x27;s easily revealed as bullshit through the use of EROEI (Energy returned on energy invested) accounting, and it&#x27;s easy to show how &#x27;SolutionX&#x27; (solar in this case) makes itself clean over time.<p>How is that the case with this aluminium fuel cell concept? Any advances in energy generation and CO2 capture are probably going to happen independently of aluminium fuel cell production. There&#x27;s certainly plenty of incentive for both already, the aluminium fuel cells won&#x27;t create a new market.<p>In conclusion, you&#x27;re right that an aluminium based energy storage cycle would be more attractive if we had vast quantities of cheap and clean energy and low emission method of capturing CO2 and turning it into carbon.\nBut....\n1. We have neither of those things\n2. So for now an aluminium energy storage cycle is probably unattractive for most applications\n3. If we did have both of those things it would totally change the economics of all sorts of other solutions, so you&#x27;d need to recalculate those as well before doing any comparisons between aluminium fuel cells and (e.g.) synthetic gasoline.",1402022025

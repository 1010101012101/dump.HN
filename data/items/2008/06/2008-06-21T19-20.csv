223820,story,,,14,19,swombat,"Ask YC: Any successful start-ups which outsourced their product development?",,"My personal experience tells me that product development is the last thing that a start-up should outsource. You don't outsource your core competency, and the core competency of a start-up is product development.<p>In fact, I've seen some start-ups fail quite badly after outsourcing their development (and, in my opinion, that was because they did so). By contrast, every start-up that succeeded spectacularly seems to have had some serious engineering talent involved right from the start.<p>However, to keep an open mind, I'd be interested to know whether anyone knows of successful start-ups (i.e.: made a good profit, and are reasonably well-known in their niche) which did successfully outsource their product development. It'd be particularly interested if there are any such start-ups which actually outsourced their development to a low-cost location like China or India, and still succeeded.<p>Thanks for any information on that matter!",1214077427

223815,comment,223021,223179,0,0,gunderson,,,"There was just an article linked on HN the other day by some professor who pointed that out.<p>But the logic is pretty straightforward:<p>Most startups fail.  Suppose startups that succeed have a return of x%.<p>Compare this to established firms, which rarely fail, and usually have positive returns, even though they're less than the returns of the 1 in 30 successful startup.<p>So overall, the investor would be better off investing in big firms -- this is why the SEC restricts investing in ""high risk"" startup firms to accredited investors only.<p>Of course, if you found a startup you surely don't expect it to fail (I know I don't).  Investing in a startup (as in investor or founder or employee) has a greater chance of making you millions, and a greater chance of making you nothing, compared to an established firm.  But on average, the returns from startups (when you include all those that fail) is worse than for bigger firms.<p>This is why successful VC firms are picky with who they invest in and why they focus on profitable exits even at the expense of a more sustainable long term strategy.<p>It's also why 37 Signals focuses on telling people to start a sustainable small business rather than a startup -- startups and the associated gabling psychology are often poor investments, and one doesn't necessarily want to forsake a nice small business in order to make a big gamble.",1214077137

223809,comment,223708,223708,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"As everyone has pointed out, hosting is an extremely competitive space.  We (Virtualmin) build tools for the industry, and the majority of our customers are providing hosting services in one form or another (though not all could be called ""hosting providers""--many are web developers that host their clients sites as a value-add, and for their own convenience, since they can always install the software they need when they need it).<p>I would recommend you do a bit more research before building a basic hosting service.  You'll be competing with people who charge a couple of bucks per month for service.  It takes an awful lot of customers to make a living out of $2/month agreements (many of whom will disappear after the first month or two, so customer acquisition will be a constant struggle).<p>I would almost certainly recommend you aim for the high end of the market rather than the low.  You can't do it with a cPanel plan from Hostgator, however.  You'll need one or more dedicated servers with a good method of backing it up (either to S3 or to a file share at your hosting provider).  From there, pick a niche that you love (Ruby on Rails, Python/Django, PHP with some framework or application, etc.) and build a really nice service based on providing the best possible user experience for deploying that kind of application.  Or, focus on your local market, and build relationships with small businesses in your area.  In either case, you can charge a premium for good service, and because you're offering a very focused set of features (either support for a complex set of tools, or a local personal touch, or something else) you won't be competing with every hosting provider in the world (of which there are thousands or tens of thousands depending on your definition of hosting provider).",1214076949

223803,comment,221868,222119,0,0,neilk,,,"That's very easy to say, but the reality is more complex.<p>Much of the attraction of Craigslist is the free posting. Not all the groups are commercial in nature, many are just discussion. Also, the Craigslist founders think of the site as a public service.<p>No convenient and reliable micropayments system yet exists. Cost per transaction on credit cards is far too high. Online games use private currencies; you buy a big chunk of currency and you draw on it for in-game transactions. That could work, and it kills spam dead, but the big upfront cost would make many users hesitate before posting. It's not like a game, where you can expect to play for hours at a time. I bet most Craigslist users post perhaps once or twice a year.<p>Extra screens for purchasing would also complicate the UI. Another deterrent to posting.<p>It's not clear to me that you could set a price which deters spammers but allows the good postings through. The economics are different from email spam. A spammer can flood a Craigslist group with just a few hundred messages, and then Craigslist will do the work of distributing it to millions.<p>Furthermore some Craigslist spammers are real local businesses that just post too frequently, or in improper places. Like a local car dealership flooding the used cars group. The dealership's expected return might be a few thousand dollars, and they may be perfectly willing to spend $20.<p>Maybe payments are part of the solution, but I don't think they can be the whole solution; at least not if Craigslist wants to be like it has been in the past.",1214075985

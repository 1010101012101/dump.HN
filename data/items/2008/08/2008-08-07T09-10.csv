As we have seen on the Internet, the more people that one can reach at low cost, the more niche the needs a business can successfully fill. The best candidates to fill such niche needs are small startups, not corporations.<p>If people with money are moving into the city, then by definition, more people can be reached at a lower cost. If these people have money, then they will be willing to spend it on something that improves their lives.<p>The argument is really easy when you just look at shops today. Even without a rich population, the denser downtown areas are full of small businesses. In the suburbs, where people are more spread out, chains rule.<p>In Europe, where the author claims this gentrification has already occurred in several places, are there not small town book stores, restaurants, coffee shops, and even shoemakers?<p>I'm really curious what made the author even add this comment to begin with. It was like he was too afraid of saying that city life in the future is going to be wonderful, so he had to throw something negative in there.",1218102709

269496,comment,268633,269452,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>I still use it on a server or 2, it's got some very nice organisation not seen in ubuntu or others.</i><p>Sure, it's nifty to play with.  But, it's the basic philosophy of Gentoo that is broken (for anything other than a tinkerers OS).  Nothing can be predicted in a Gentoo system, and no Gentoo system is the same as any other.  Lots of fun, and infinitely customizable.  But, in a server, you need to know where you stand--and being able to experiment has far less value.<p>I'll happily concede that portage has done wonders with a rather complex problem...allowing custom on-the-spot builds of everything, and being able to upgrade and install most of the time without resulting in a flaming pile of wreckage.  As long as the philosophy is ""anything you want, even stuff that has practically zero testing, and all built from scratch while you wait"", Gentoo will remain unpredictable and unreliable, and occasionally insane.<p>Every package and option that Gentoo provides is a new variable...something new that can go wrong.  You cannot test that many variables, no matter how smart you are.  And, of course, I don't think the Gentoo developers are particularly smarter than the folks behind Debian or RHEL or Ubuntu, though they may be <i>as</i> smart...but to be as successful with their chosen philosophy they have to be significantly smarter and significantly more numerous, because they have to solve far harder problems and on a scale never before seen.  A very basic grasp of combinatorial mathematics tells me that Gentoo will have several orders of magnitude more possible failure paths than RHEL or Debian.<p>Anyway, if you opt to stick with an entirely stock install of Gentoo (by some definition of ""stock"") you will get a system that has as few variables as RHEL or CentOS or Debian or Ubuntu, which is a win.  But, you lose the things that make Gentoo unique (and exciting for some folks)...<i>and</i> you get a system that is tested by a tiny fraction as many people as have tested RHEL, CentOS, Debian, or Ubuntu.  Not only is the userbase dramatically smaller, it's also fractured into thousands of unique distros, because so few people are running a ""default"" Gentoo.<p>What always amazes me is that the Gentoo developers don't realize what a mess they've signed up for with the choices they've made.  They do have some awesome documentation, though.  That may be a side effect of a system that is so vaguely defined...anyone that wants to accomplish anything with it has to read a lot and know a lot, so a lot of docs get written.  I dunno.",1218102485

269493,comment,269413,269413,0,0,swombat,,,"If you're doing it for free, you're a co-founder. As such, you should have a lot of founder equity. 30% sounds about right - don't forget it might get diluted later. And in that case, don't work on it unless it's a business you do want to start, obviously - and of course you can't start several of them at the same time.<p>If they want you to do it for free without giving you a large chunk of equity, fuck'em.<p>If they want to pay you, payment is within 30 days after the invoice is sent, not ""when we have cash"". That's a joke, not a contract.",1218102123

269491,comment,268633,268633,0,0,LKM,,,"It's always the same. Apple introduces new Mac, it's priced competitively. Apple waits a year until it releases a new version and doesn't cut price while other manufacturers release new versions, so the Mac becomes comparatively more expensive as time goes by. Then, Apple releases a new Mac, and the cycle starts anew. Repeat annually. There's really no need to write these ""Apple is cheaper"" ""Apple is more expensive"" articles twice each year.",1218101755

They can even be offended and upset by it. I think this startup might need to find a niche market that <i>is</i> comfortable with it.<p>It might be better to disguise/hide the money somehow (but that defeats the pitch)... or, possibly extend the underlying microtransaction technology to other subject matter that is already financial oriented (or, has a financially-oriented audience).<p>These are just my opinions.

621802,comment,621276,621423,0,0,aka,,,"Nokia has a strange relationship with the Finnish economy in general.  The size of Nokia in comparison with the country's economy is by far the largest in the developed world.  They make up more than 30% of the market capitalization of the Helsinki Stock Exchange, and over 25% of Finland's exports.<p>By way of comparison, Exxon Mobil comprises just 3% of the NYSE market capitalization.  A hypothetical merger of the 6 largest companies (Exxon Mobil, Wal-Mart, Microsoft, AT&T, Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble) would comprise just 10%.",1242986065

The abstract concepts of violence that are innate in us primates at early age have absolutely nothing to do with the message (""violence is okay and an accepted social tool"") that you commonly get exposed to on mass media.<p><i>By contrast, sex isn't on the typical 8-year-old's mind, and probably shouldn't be.</i><p>So you're okay with exposing your 8-year old to violent media but not okay with exposing him to sexually explicit media?<p>Let's look at this using your own observations: Violence is innate in children, sexuality is mostly absent. This means the child will mostly ignore the sexual content (it can't relate, is simpy not interested) but <i>will</i> process the violence in one way or another (because even a child has concepts of ""power"", ""superiority"", ""fear"" etc.).<p>Maybe think again, maybe even pick up a book on the subject.",1242985997

621791,comment,621421,621421,0,0,baguasquirrel,,,"It's a mixed bag.  I know plenty of folks in college who were good at mining connections.  Everyone made ""friends"" with them because it was thought these kids would ""succeed"".  These were the folks who could rack up 600 connections, but we all knew that they weren't friends with all those people.<p>I personally straddled that line myself, though in a different way.  Being a leader of any student organization is likely to boost your friend count by around 100, and I had held important positions in two.  But at the end of the day, that's not how many close friends you have.<p>Demographics can also make a difference.  If you went to a big high school-- say 800 kids per class --you'd probably chit-chat with around 200 other kids on a regular basis.  I had friends who did events with other schools in upstate, and that kicked up the contact list even more.  Things like that can inordinately inflate your friend count on FB.  But again, you were probably only close to maybe twelve of all those kids you knew from high school.<p>In all, I feel that Facebook was a tool to keep track of all the people you met in college (while you were still there).  After you leave school, it becomes a tool to keep in touch with them occasionally.  The other major use seems to be procrastination and banter.  By no means is it a true count of how many friends you have.",1242985169

621781,comment,621731,621731,0,0,ckinnan,,,"I saw some political polling a couple years ago-- people can't really conceptualize numbers this large.  A slight majority of the poll actually thought a million dollars was more than a billion.  People have a handle on the size of a million bucks because that amount occurs in regular life-- the price of a luxury home, etc.  I think one of the reasons there isn't much outrage at the US government's $1.8 trillion deficit this year is that it is so large it doesn't have any meaning.",1242983851

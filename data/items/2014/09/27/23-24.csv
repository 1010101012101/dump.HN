Additionally, we must realize that identifying targets is far different from developing effective drugs for these targets.<p>Scanning the comments: No one really thinks that Tau is responsible anymore.

8378514,comment,8376041,8378012,1,0,jwmerrill,,,"Not so. Roundoff errors happen because when you add a big number and a small number in finite precision, the result loses information that was in the small number. The magic of complex step differentiation is keeping the small part (the imaginary part) separate from the (potentially) large part (the value of the function evaluated at a real argument).<p>You can use a very small step size (and so get very high accuracy) with traditional finite difference differentiation at x=0 for functions with f(0) = 0. Complex step differentiation takes advantage of the fact that real valued functions of a real argument have 0 imaginary part everywhere on the real line.<p>> most problems won&#x27;t be [well conditioned] and the complex step method won&#x27;t help much then either<p>Try coming up with an example of this. You might be able to find one if there is a pole or branch cut very near the real line, but otherwise, complex step differentiation is very robust.",1411861994

Inner product of all $\\mathbb C^N$ where N in finite <i>is</i> finite. There is no point in saying &quot;L^2&quot; when talking about spins etc. (forcefully casting a finite sum of finite terms to integration and then introducing the concept of &quot;square integrable&quot; isn&#x27;t helpful, if not trivial).<p>> This is a rationalization but it&#x27;s useful.<p>You can do that kind of rationalization when you &quot;know&quot; the answer ahead. It has zero prediction power.<p>Newton had a rationalization about the independent nature of time. Descartes also had a rationalization about how action-at-a-distance works for gravity. Aether was also a popular rationalization once.\nNone of those rationalizations held any value at the end.<p>Such &quot;rationalizations&quot; are better cut by Occam&#x27;s razor and left for philosophers.<p>At least, I prefer not waste my time with such stuff as a physicist.",1411861911

That tells me he does not _assume_ his users to be using Bash.<p>Everyone has a choice.  And if you are trying to practice &quot;secure&quot; computing, then some choices are wiser than others.<p>If a user thinks Bash is the bee&#x27;s knees, then djb&#x27;s software will work just fine; it does not discriminate against that user.<p>But if a user does not use Bash, and prefers to use a more simple, POSIX-like shell, that will work just fine too.<p>This is purely my opinion but unlike so many other software authors, djb does not appear to discriminate against people who prefer simple software systems that are not loaded with &quot;features&quot;; he does not intentionally or unintentionally force them to embrace complexity or be ignored.<p>That said, it also appears he is a self-professed Ubuntu user these days.  For example, read his latest blog.cr.yp.to entry.<p>I do not understand how he can tolerate the amount of complexity in Ubuntu that is on by default and hidden from the user.  But maybe I&#x27;m just too stupid to understand.<p>There seems to be a choice of at least two options:<p>1. keep Bash installed and try to determine every possible untrusted user input accepting or internet facing application that might at some time use the system shell, or<p>2. uninstall Bash and use a barebones POSIX-like shell without extra features.<p>Preserving the continued use of shell scripts with Bash-isms as a reason to choose option #1 does not make sense to me.  Maybe there are other &quot;compelling&quot; reasons?  (Interactive shell features?)  With a little effort, these Bash script authors could probably learn to write scripts that do not use Bash-isms. Is that really so terrible as to make option #2 untenable?<p>If there are enormous Bash scripts being relied on in security senstive settings which &quot;cannot&quot; be rewritten in POSIX shell, then maybe the mistake was ever &quot;deploying&quot; such monstrosities in the first place.<p>Shell scripts, no matter what shell, should always be relatively small assuming the author has any common sense.",1411861829

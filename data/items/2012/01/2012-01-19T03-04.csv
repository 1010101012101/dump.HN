For instance, in Brazil, a presidential (or gubernatorial, etc) candidate must have a majority (that is, more than 50% of the votes) to win. Suppose in the first-stage we have candidate A with 30%, B with 20%, C with 15%, etc. Then a couple of months later we have a second-stage with candidates A and B. So it's possible that B wins.<p>I believe in the approval voting that you mention, there's a situation where candidate C would be able to win, which is also interesting.",1326945597
3483161,comment,3482117,3482918,4,0,snikolov,,,"<i>I can't possibly imagine a better introductory Computer Science class</i><p>MIT student here. My year was the first to have to do the new curriculum. Here's my understanding of it.<p>The replacement courses (6.01 and 6.02) are not supposed to be intro CS courses. They are meant to expose people to broadly applicable engineering principles in both electrical engineering and computer science. And like SICP, they are not about programming.<p>What used to happen with the old curriculum is that everyone --- both electrical engineering and computer science students --- would take 6.001, circuits, signals & systems, and architecture. With the current curriculum you get broad exposure in the beginning with 6.01 and 6.02 and have a bit more flexibility in your other requirements (if you're into pure CS, you can avoid sitting through a semester of circuit theory, if you want).<p>How was it in Berkeley? Are the EE and CS departments separate?",1326945566
3483160,comment,3480635,3482994,1,0,fossuser,,,"Facebook often advertises products related to user information (merchandise from a movie for example).  If it's something the user may be interested in buying they hadn't thought about but noticed from that ad, I see that as a benefit of targeted advertising.  I'm not sure I understand your point about this.<p>As far as Google and Facebook I think they recognize that they're better off taking care of their users for long term success.  I suppose you could argue this is only a temporary stance based on company culture, but I don't know if I'd agree with it.<p>Facebook takes a lot of heat and is often talked about on HN as this malevolent advertising company (privacy be damned), but to me this criticism always seemed overblown.  I've always personally viewed them as actually trying to do what they say they're trying to accomplish.  As far as the last point about Facebook being dominant, just because a company is dominant doesn't mean they're entirely about perpetuating their own existence.  Facebook still rapidly makes changes and improves their platform, they also didn't do anything anti-competitive to try and destroy Google+ or Diaspora (I think Mark even donated to Diaspora).<p>This is all background to why I think the OP's article is unlikely.  I think these companies build new features to keep their users happy and using their site, not design new features with the main purpose of secretly tricking them into more advertising.  It isn't all about profit.",1326945557

However, I'm not sure it holds except to the extent that the copying is <i>slow</i> and the buyers impatient. Then, the first batch captures enough of the market to incent the author.<p>But if most of the market is patient enough to await the arrival of slow-copycats, the initial investment in the 'first batch' (by not just the creator but the publisher/wholesaler/retailer is in danger, and thus deterred without copyright. In fact, large losses could be incurred being stuck with an inventory that's later undercut. Fears of such losses could cut off a gradual build to popularity before it starts.<p>Digital reproduction/dissemination eliminates the need for most of that 'first batch' investment and all the downside risk of production/inventory; only the creation itself must be incentivized. All the other once-necessary costs no longer need a legal hack (statutory monopoly) as a sort of subsidy.<p>I'll have to look at the Breyer reasoning to know what factors dominate under which assumptions.",1326945346

I don't know what else one can expect, but for many of us, we just live here now. We are outnumbered and outgunned. Short of leaving our entire life and more importantly family to move away from it, there is not much we can do other than rage against the machine.

Know exactly what you're doing, and have great focus; but also have a strong awareness of what your complements as a good leading indicator of where you can grow.<p>BTW, on that note... for the hackers in the crowd, who are doing startups but have never cracked open a marketing book or anything ""business related,"" I'd like to offer a suggestion.

Other new ones have popped up that are now selling beer and food during the film. Still others are showing fewer blockbusters, but more classics and inviting directors, actors, and other crew to hold QnA sessions after the screenings.<p>In the short term, damage is done, jobs are lost, businesses fail. In the long term, scar tissue forms and society rebuilds, better than it was before. It's all a bunch of grand experiments. Who knows what will stick?<p>> capitalism doesn't create monopolies<p>It most certainly does create monopolies AND oligarchies. Just look at history. Some other reply to me suggested it was government's fault. Yeah that too. Also see history :-)<p>> For example, it's not a very good idea to have 100 different power companies where you live because it is much more efficient and therefore better for society to have only one company<p>This is a pretty different discussion.<p>In terms of ideology, I'd consider myself a social libertarian. I believe that the government should do only really two categories of things:<p>1) Act as a check/balance on businesses (ie. make sure my food is safe to eat & that no one organization goes around destroying the greater good for personal gains)<p>2) Provide municipal services where there is either (A) conflict of interest (eg. health insurance) or (B) unsatisfiable constraints to sustain business (eg. no one will deliver mail to a 10 person town; or road construction)<p>However, the problem is that when technology changes, government needs to be able to rapidly evolve it's involvement in both areas. Sadly, it seems incapable of rethinking any idea without a full reboot (<i>cough</i> bloody revolution) or a fist full of lobbying dollars.<p>For example: Today, I support the government's control of road construction. If teleporters are invented tomorrow, I would demand that the government immediately develop a plan for reducing and ultimately eliminating their involvement in transportation.",1326944990

3483133,comment,3468324,3468324,1,0,tangentcity,,,"You won't type faster than you think. Typing fast - apart from the manual ability to do it - requires thinking fluently. Maybe you're inhibiting yourself by self-editing while you're forming the sentences in your mind as you're typing. Try free-writing: writing anything, as long as it's English (not random letters), not censoring anything, nonsense or sense welcome indifferently. What's the fastest you can write without putting on the brakes to judge? That would be the upper limit of your dexterity. (It's also a good exercise.)<p>Practice is a huge factor in dexterity. I think my typing speed increased linearly from the 40s to the 70-80 wpm range during the four years or so when time I was typing 3,000-10,000 words (10-20) pages every day. It has plateaued there for the last 10 years, because I just don't type as much.<p>Your gear counts. For me the ultimate feel was the IBM Selectric II, the one with the ball. The whirr and strike of when you hit a key, the hum of the machine waiting if you paused to ponder, encouraged typing. Most computer keyboards today make dispiriting noises. Hackers and writers will prefer the Das Keyboard (<a href=""http://www.daskeyboard.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daskeyboard.com/</a>). They say the all-black one forces your brain to touch type since it's hopeless to hunt and peck. I like it mostly because of the feel - the force you need to type on an 'a' or a semi-colong is less than for an ""f"" or a ""j"". The Das has a real smooth ride. There's something in that racket that encourages fast typing, like the first few pings of metallic raindrops building to a sustained mechanical storm - all because of your awesome creativity and work ethic. You can even pack and play - take it on trips for you if you know you will have to use someone else's inferior desktop setup.<p>The fastest way to write is steno. Plover (<a href=""http://plover.stenoknight.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plover.stenoknight.com/</a>) has been mentioned on HN recently.<p>Practice is the most important - Gladwell's annoying 10,000 hours and all. Not only rack up the hours, but practice with your whole body and mind. What are you writing, anyway? Don't think for a second that Malmsteen played guitar to meet a metric. You gotta have a feel for what, and why you're doing, what you're doing.<p>In summary like what you write, like your gear, and use it intensely. If you don't improve then you might be limited genetically, which doesn't matter. Once the ink dries, nobody knows how long it took you.",1326944815

3483082,comment,3482333,3482765,9,0,samlev,,,"Let's take this metaphor a little further, then.<p>Digital content isn't exactly like a hot dog, so let's assume that you could design a magical hot dog which, once created, you can copy many times with no other costs. You have an unlimited supply of hot dogs, and each one of these hot dogs, being an exact copy of the original, can also be used to magically make more hot dogs.<p>Now I'm not saying that this hot dog is free - it cost a LOT in R&D to produce this hot dog, and you invested a lot in it. The other thing is that hot dogs go with buns, and there's sadly no magical buns in this universe. Each and every bun has to be created, and costs money.<p>So you set up your hot dog stand, selling magical hot dogs with non-magical buns. You charge a premium rate because you're the only guy in town who managed to make a magical hot dog of this quality, and with it's unique flavour. Besides, the buns are still costing you money, and they have to come from somewhere.<p>Now you notice some guy has found out that the magical hot dog you sold him can make new hot dogs at no cost, but they don't have the buns attached. As a response, you start baking the hot dogs into the bread - it makes it harder to get the hot dog out, and you think that that's the end of it. But the guy realises that with a bit of effort, he can get the hot dog out of the bread too, because what's the point of a hot dog if you can't get at it? Baking the hot dog into the bread is costing you even more, and making it harder for people to get to the hot dog.<p>Soon you have some people coming up to you and asking if they can have seeded bread, or maybe gluten free, or maybe they just hate bread and want it on it's own. Some of them want to buy just your hot dog and put it on their <i>own</i> bread. But if you start selling them hot dogs by themselves, won't they just start handing out free hot dogs to all their friends? That would be a disaster! So your answer is no! Hot dogs come baked into bread, and by now you've convinced the mayor to make it illegal to take your hot dogs out of the bread. People should just learn to love your bread!<p>So how's the guy who took your hot dog out of it's bread going? He's still giving away hot dogs for free, and what's worse is that he's telling everyone he gives one to to give them away, too. It's costing him nothing to do because he doesn't have to pay for bread. Sure, some people are still coming to you because they actually like the bread, but mostly the people coming to you are asking about bread-free options, and are still willing to pay. Most of the people going to the guy who's giving out hot dogs for free never bought anything from you, and some of them don't even eat the hot dogs. Sure, you see a few of your old customers going to him instead, but mostly the people going to him either never came to you, or (after tasting the free hot dog) later come to you to buy a genuine one in bread.<p>The point isn't that the guy giving away free hot dogs isn't a jerk. He is. The point is that you're stubbornly refusing to let people pay for a hot dog how they want it, in a way that costs you less (because you don't have to adjust the price for the bread - you just have to cover your costs, rather than incurring new ones).<p>You're doing this in an attempt to stop people doing what they're already doing. People don't want to rip you off - they just want to be able to pick their own bread.<p>To break from the analogy now, I was happily a pirate because it was difficult for me to get what I wanted how I wanted <i>and there was no technical reason why it wasn't available</i>. Sure, if I wanted all my movies as flip-books, then there's a technical reason why that doesn't make sense, but there's no technical reason stopping me from getting them as digital media files.<p>If I'm looking for music from a band, I will <i>always</i> try to find a legal channel to obtain it first. If I can't find one (and these days, it's getting pretty rare), then I'll probably pirate it. Sure, some people will pirate it anyway because they feel entitled to it, but the point is that many, many people have no problems paying for content <i>so long as they can get it how and when they want it</i>. This type of availability of content is pretty much what TPB seems to be about for many people. It's not about screwing content producers - it's about freedom of choice.<p>Anyway, that's my take on it. I <i>know</i> that there are people who will always choose to steal rather than pay, but most of society would happily pay <i>if only we were allowed to</i>.",1326943645

To pirate it and not compensate the companies involved is irresponsible, selfish and ignorant -- it is stealing.  There is is great amount of financial investment that goes into creating these movies.  Today with the internet, the distribution avenue exists for people to produce and self publish, independent of Hollywood, but there is so much more to creating a successful movie: expensive sets, actors' salaries, special effects, post processing, marketing, the list goes on... In order to be successful these movies require great financial outlay and to expect the final product to be free is ridiculous.  If these people really believe in free movies and music, they'd boycott Hollywood productions (they very stuff they call 'trash') and instead trade independent creations where the artist or writer chooses to give it away.<p>This argument is not about freedom of exchanging original ideas or even sharing bits of ""copyrighted"" information, it's about the wholesale stealing of movies which took a great deal of time money and effort to create, even if they are considered 'trash'.

3483036,comment,3482333,3482992,0,0,andrewcamel,,,"Let's go with a movie as an example. I agree with you - you cannot own an idea, but a movie that took a hell of a lot of time and money to make is not an idea. And if you want to have further justification for this, a movie is a physical thing. It actually exists, albeit in the form of ones and zeroes on a hard drive, but it does actually exist. If you are obtaining these ones and zeroes that someone invested a lot of capital to make without paying for them, you are stealing! Those ones and zeroes belong to the company and you have to pay the company to get a copy of the ones and zeroes. This isn't my definition of stealing; it's in the dictionary.<p>It doesn't make a difference at all whether or not you are copying something or actually removing it from its original place. If you are going with your argument, any company that makes software should only be able to sell that software once and after that, anyone should be able to copy it. Every person that uses the software is getting the value of the software that the original person put capital into creating and you should have to pay for that, not get it for free.",1326942351

The specific case was when the matrices involved grew so large that the linear access operations were causing page faults for sequential row or column access.  This was a perfect example of pathologically bad memory accesses when data was stored in row-major or column-major layouts.<p>Very impressive speedups for these interleaved data layouts.  The end goal was to embed these layouts into the compiler tools, so that the programmer would do normal two dimensional matrix allocations and would get the optimized layout based on analysis.<p>I wrote terrible C to accomplish these layouts and minimize the instruction counts.",1326942341

No, really, the old Athenian system allowed citizens to participate much more directly, so when a moral panic started they could do really nasty stuff.<p>Now, perhaps I'm being unfair. If you dig a bit deeper, you'll learn that Socrates was officially killed for impiety, and corrupting the young. Unofficially, he was killed for inspiring the Thirty Tyrants. It's debatable whether or not he was in any way responsible for their actions - Plato says no (though Plato was heavily biased) - but it seemed probable to a lot of people at the time. They couldn't get actually punish him for inspiring the Tyrants, because immunity was granted as part of a peace treaty, but when Socrates went ahead preaching his military dictatorship to a whole new generation, people got a bit upset.<p>Sortition is actually quite a good idea - get a representative bunch of people, and let them debate the issue. It's a jury system. You don't want politicians to decide things, because they are the worst kind of decision makers (or so some people say). You don't want the uninformed populous to make decisions, because they are uniformed. So you get a sample of the populous, let them gather information, and then they can make an informed decision. Sure, Athens did some barbaric shit. But so did practically every other civilization at the time. The only thing to watch out for is people protecting their franchise - Athens stayed quite xenophobic and misogynistic, as the old Athenian men were the only ones who could vote, and didn't want their power being diluted.",1326942025

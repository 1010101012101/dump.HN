But that&#x27;s what makes it Hacker News.<p>This has obviously been a pretty difficult week for Aereo, and lots of people are speculating about what will happen to the company – but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re done just yet.",1403967554

Just bringing the lawsuit will cost you money that you probably don&#x27;t have and will easily put you in debt without the case even getting to a court room.<p>Fourth, the name &quot;Yo Messenger&quot; makes it sound like a different product under the Yo brand thus causing easy confusion with consumers and I am sure any court would probably see similar.

I heard one believable legend at the time of a company with one or more boards that used a particularly pretty blue type of bypass capacitor (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoupling_capacitor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoupling_capacitor</a>).  I think the original Multiwire Lisp Machine memory boards also used them, they were quite sharp looking, evidently a naturally popular choice.<p>Anyway, the guy in charge in procuring parts suddenly found them unavailable, or with too long a lead time, and was tearing his hair out before he asked the engineers what could be done.  After noting it was chosen for esthetics and there were many less pretty ones that would work just as well, the problem was solved.<p>But if you&#x27;ve got something more complicated than ubiquitous capacitors and the like, not having it available at all halts you in your tracks, and that&#x27;s true for every one of the zillions of parts in your products.

First, we examine data from a business’s customers through the collection of reviews, check-ins, and connections that have already been generated across social media.&quot;<p>I strongly disagree that this is the right solution. This is essentially taking the underwriting process and shifting it from banks to...social media users?

7958281,comment,7954778,7956307,1,0,WorldWideWayne,,,"> MS has a history of abandoning its developer platforms and frameworks....VB6, Silverlight, WinForms and WPF are all effectively deprecated...Likewise with XNA...CSF, WCF, etc...<p>&quot;Deprecated&quot; is just a word that means absolutely nothing here since all of those kits are still fully functional on current versions of Windows (including XNA and the server side stuff that you mentioned). And VB6 is 20 years old! You wanna make a bet that your Android, Dart or Go code will run in 20 years? Android code from 2008 won&#x27;t even run today mate :) Also, when Google deprecates something - it&#x27;s usually hooked to a service, so there&#x27;s no hope to keep using it when it&#x27;s no longer fashionable (like some are doing with VB6, Foxpro and other really old kits).<p>> Whilst VisualStudio is a great IDE, I find it a subpar experience without R#.<p>And I find the lack of a single IDE built and maintained by Google to be sub-subpar. Visual Studio is superb without R#, but even if you don&#x27;t think so - at least Microsoft is making life easy by offering an IDE that is tuned specifically for the task at hand instead of using some open source pile of junk that tries to do everything. There&#x27;s nothing to decide when I need to do .NET - I know what tools to use. Meanwhile Google has no comprehensive strategy here and you&#x27;re forced to cobble together your own toolkit. Blech.<p>> Another killer feature is that the language and tooling is cross-platform which supports Windows, OSX and Linux.<p>That&#x27;s a weakness because &quot;cross-platform&quot; means a crappy non-native Java UI or some half-functional impostor built with HTML - and those tools suck on <i>every</i> platform. No thanks, I like things that are native to my platform please. Besides that, I can certainly do all of my coding on Windows and build and run it on Linux without any problem thanks (because I have been).<p>I don&#x27;t really want to spend my time responding to another wall of text or the rest of this one so I&#x27;m going to end it here. I will say that Google does some cool stuff in the browser and with Android, but my main point here is that they don&#x27;t put forth a very comprehensive strategy at all. Most of their developer stuff seems to be created by 20 percenters in their spare time instead of making a concerted effort like Microsoft does.",1403965716

We just launched a more complete version {1} of the popular Yo App and we are getting lots of downloads. But now, he is freaking out about getting sued for using a similar name and layout as the Yo app.\nMostly he is worried about having Yo in the app title, which I don’t see any problem with. However, now he changed the app title in our play store account a second time without telling me so in response, I blocked his access.<p>His main argument for not using Yo in our name, is that we shouldn’t be gaining traction from what others have built. However, I think tries to make up arguments why we should change the name. Also, in my opinion our app is significantly different to Yo and he is simply getting worked up about us getting sued for copyright infringement or intellectual property theft.<p>Moreover, having yo in the name is crucial for our app to gain traction as it communicates to people that they can do “one-word” communication to their friends similar to Yo, just in a bit of a different way.<p>I think my question is, is there any way we could get sued realistically? The thing is that we’re in German jurisdiction, so there is not much anyone can sue us about outside of Germany and if it goes through, it would take a year or so, wouldn’t it?<p>{1} https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.messenger.labs",1403965426

When doing maths on paper, you learn to recognize fragments and how to move them around.  The intuitions are quite different.<p>The user interface lets you add functions and symbols which can alternatively be written in plain text, e.g. &quot;sin(\\alpha)^2=sqrt(x)&quot;.

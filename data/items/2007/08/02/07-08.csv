The creator should, however, have a great deal of pride in the products or services produced.  This will lead to more conviction when it comes time to raise money and get costumers, which will further the chances of success. ",1186041307

38615,comment,38485,38541,0,0,Tichy,,,"I can never really agree to such a clause, though. In the most extreme case it would mean I could never take on another contract, because I already used up all my programming tricks in the first one. For example I might have employed the MVC pattern, will I be able to ever use it again?",1186039298

And with each day, there are good moments and there are bad moments.<p>Today has been a bad day, with very few good moments. I just sat down with a beta tester and watched him go through the joining process. Part of the problem is that joining is, in fact, a ""process"". Watching him use the site also revealed a plethora of glitches that are going to keep me up all night and well into tomorrow. <p>Days like today force me to think about each and every mistake I've made so far, where I went wrong in each instance, and how easily each mistake could have been avoided had I done X - whatever X may be.<p>Ugh.",1186039270

Perhaps it's better to get out there and try, and fail, rather than aim for perfection and never even really try.",1186038928

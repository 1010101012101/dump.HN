There are 2 good reasons for this:<p>1) the volume is (still) very low, and a lot of wealth is in the hands of just a few people, meaning that they can single-handedly let the market crash.<p>2) most of the people who have bitcoins don&#x27;t even have experience with trading, yet they&#x27;re trying to trade. This results in a very, very unpredictable market because a lot of people will panic sell and take unlogical steps that a professional trader would never take. It also means that the price is mostly driven by hype, not by any fundament.<p>I think most traders will stay away from bitcoin untill it&#x27;s a bit more stable.

If the purpose you state is correct then anything of similar value could substitute instead. It could be an emerald, or a platinum bracelet, or real estate. Anything that serves as an appropriately valuable engagement present.<p>Moreover, diamonds have been particularly poor at serving that purpose because they <i>don&#x27;t</i> have high value. Ever try to sell one? De Beers had a de facto diamond monopoly and artificially inflated retail prices by restricting supply and controlling resellers. But if you go try to sell a diamond as a private individual, you won&#x27;t get anything like what someone would pay for it at retail, because the retail prices were set artificially high by De Beers. Compare this to e.g. precious metals where you can walk into a pawn shop and buy or sell for only a small percentage deviation from the spot price. Meanwhile you&#x27;re just asking for someone other than De Beers to discover large deposits of diamonds and break the monopoly which will cause prices to crash much harder than they would for a normal commodity with the same new resource discovery, which is exactly what happened a little more than a decade ago. And this is before we even get to the whole issue with conflict diamonds.",1386089804

For example, NFL draft picks are in reverse order of season success. If last year&#x27;s Super Bowl winner was able to choose their next team on a completely free market, they would simply use their boosted revenue and pay the most for the best players, thus making it much more likely that they&#x27;ll increase their domination. No one wants to watch a dominating team shut out clearly inferior teams game after game.<p>F1 needs rules to tighten gaps between the team and to prevent one team from spending their way to success.

6841469,comment,6838836,6841259,2,0,eranation,,,"Well we do share the C# background, but I lastly used C# about 8 years ago, a lot has changed.<p>As much as I would love to have a Ruby background, Ruby (mostly on Rails) for me is a hobby language / framework, can&#x27;t use it at work, sadly.<p>I actually come from 10 years of writing mostly Java and JavaScript. I (used to) like Java, but I will replace both Java and JavaScript with Scala in any of my new projects without hesitation. Including taking into account on-boarding new team members, including taking into account how complex people can get with Scala, trust me, bad developers make spaghetti from anything, Java included, and spaghetti is not the worse thing, bad buggy code is. you&#x27;ll be shocked how many Java developers don&#x27;t know the contract between hashCode and equals in Java. in Scala, if you use a case class (or data class in Kotlin) you get default equals and hashCode for you, so for you little DTO bean, you&#x27;ll avoid having duplicates in a set (very common Java newbie bug).\nAlso I tend to find that huge amount of Java bugs end up having the same 2-3 exceptions - and most notoriously the NullPointerException. With Scala options, it&#x27;s diminished significantly.<p>p.s. I did some college projects with C++, and can read it but I can&#x27;t really understand the comparison to Scala, really.<p>So I personally won&#x27;t be worried about Scala replacing Java mainstream industry world.<p>1) it will take a lot of time for it to happen even if HN was full of (&quot;Scala is even better than Go / Haskell / Clojure, my eyes are opened!&quot;<p>2) even if it does, I am (very subjectively) about 10X more productive with it, and write / read code much more easily with it than with the same code written in Java, but this is only because me and my team constrain ourselves to avoid abusing the language. E.g. there is nothing wrong with if(option.isDefined) if you don&#x27;t like pattern matching. or using dot notation and avoiding infix notation when not really needed. I also don&#x27;t care about using vars, or using while loops when it&#x27;s more readable, I always provide a named function to my operators, and only use implicit conversions when it really needed and helps code readability (for example to use it for actual CONVERSIONS and avoid method overloading hell and not just to pimp a library)\nI also avoid one liner terse code that no one can read (or debug) and the end result is 10X more happiness, productivity and fun than with boring old Java. \nI also use it with Spring, Java EE and Maven instead of sbt. Scala if used this way, is indeed a better Java. But it needs guidance, so perhaps it indeed needs a &quot;the good parts&quot; book / style guide / Linter<p>p.s. \nIf you spent some time to learn Scala and tried it on a project, and still prefer using Clojure, I&#x27;ll believe you. if you say you prefer Scala over Java, I will force myself to respect you and avoid being accused of an ad hominem attack :)",1386089771

Something way more important was the first widely-available consumer 8-bit computers.

What year did those drop 82-83? The games for those PC-precursors were 1) way better and 2) pirate&#x27;s booty. The abilities of those machines moved beyond what could be packed into consoles and the margins seemed higher. The price for a game went to free. That meant you could buy second floppy drives, 300 baud modems, dot matrix printers (24 pins FTW!) instead of games.<p>Computer clubs were not uncommon and literal swap meets of 5.5&quot; floppies.

6841338,comment,6838434,6838434,3,0,micro_cam,,,"As someone who focused on proof based mathematics in collage and is largely a self taught programer I think this proposal has merit. Begin forced to confront abstraction and formalism without any crutches as a freshman in college changed and expanded the way I thought. Learning to write down a correct proof without an external way of verifying it is an experience everyone should have.<p>However I think this needs to be coupled with an introduction to the concrete at a younger age. In mathematics we teach arithmetic to young children then step up the ladder of abstraction to high school algebra, simple proofs and linear algebra before eventually exposing them to abstract algebra (ie group theory etc). Teaching abstract algebra first would make theoretical sense but the mind tends to need to know at least one example of something before it accepts the abstraction.<p>I imagine a playful introduction to programing for young children coupled with a strong course in formalism for young adults could produce some great programers. Though, as with the proof based math series I took, I&#x27;m sure there would also be loads of freshman drop outs/transfers to more applied courses.<p>I also agree with others that insight rarely comes from pure  formalism. The point of learning these things is to expand the way your mind works allowing you to think about abstract objects and allowing you to verify insight when it does come.<p>For me Charlie Parker sums up the necessity of a formal education even if it is not explicitly used in practice:<p>&quot;Master your instrument, master the music & then forget all that & just play.&quot;",1386088862

It&#x27;s been sitting for half a year collecting dust.<p>Right now it uses a JSON feed that I got from Watsi to display projects, but it needs manual entry of projects to make this concept work. detail about this on DN: <a href=\"https://news.layervault.com/stories/11029-ask-dn-will-you-help-me-finish-this-fundraising-app-for-watsi-\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.layervault.com/stories/11029-ask-dn-will-you-he...</a><p>Would like to finish this app with some help.<p>Rundown on the app:<p>A brand purchases a charitable project by committing to its funding target.<p>Users connect their Runkeeper account (fitbit/jawbone up/etc.), select a project to run for, and then for every mile they run, they&#x27;ll accrue a micro-donation towards that project (provided by the brand sponsor) until the project is fully funded.<p>It&#x27;s Charity Miles with measurable initiatives, which I think is just a better model because when a user runs and shares that activity to FB, Watsi would get an impression in the Newsfeed showcasing the project that the user is currently running for. This advertises the actual work that they&#x27;re doing rather than just the organization. I also think it&#x27;s more interesting to share stories with a measurable impact associated with my milage. Stories are dynamic; they&#x27;re constantly changing as projects get funded rather than the repetitive data of my milage as a stand alone update.<p>It solves a problem for Nonprofits. Advertising is expensive, and NPO&#x27;s receive criticism for aggressive ad spend, which they need to do to keep the donations rolling in so that they can continue their work. See Dan Pallotta&#x27;s TED talk. The reliable source of funding is a nice plus too.<p>Brands are presented with a more interesting avenue for cause marketing than what is currently available. With Cause Marketing, the typical trigger for donation is Likes, RT&#x27;s, and purchase triggered donations. However, with a system like this, the brand is engaging and getting an impression in a lifestyle context where the trigger is &quot;go work out.&quot; They&#x27;re basically saying that &quot;if you invest in you, then we&#x27;ll invest in you AND the world.&quot; They&#x27;re also getting what is potentially a timeline of initiatives through the projects that they&#x27;ve funded, which tells the (story) of their impact. I think this is a really powerful proposition to brands. It hits on everything Umair Haque talks about Re: the requisites of &quot;meaningful brands&quot;, which I find super interesting. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zCGoKVN4Cc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zCGoKVN4Cc</a><p>The take away here is that it&#x27;s worth exploring. For me, it&#x27;s something that I want to complete, but am not necessarily interested in ownership. These systems, which provide much needed support for nonprofits should exist, and so I&#x27;m willing to contribute to creating this. If you want to run with it, awesome! I&#x27;ll help you get brands on board, and I&#x27;ll help you with the design.",1386088822

6841259,comment,6838836,6841118,2,0,cygwin98,,,"I think we share a similar background. I was coming from Ruby on Rails and C# background, and now am spreading into JVM via Clojure. Before C#, I did everything in C++, which I don&#x27;t like. The past few years has seen a turmoil of battles on the web frontend, which caused a huge number of churning without much progress technically, totally waste of time and efforts in the web community.<p>Now, it seems to me that that turmoil is inching into the backend and JVM. A wrong selection of technology stack would cause a huge waste of time investment. That&#x27;s why some of us stand up and say no to Scala, which has been aggressively marketed  as Java++ for the past few years, and seems to gain some momentum. I personally consider that&#x27;s a dangerous sign, as the objective of Scala (IMHO) is to replace Java as the mainstream industry language. With the complexity of Scala, can you imagine the average Java programmer starts to write libraries in Scala? That would be disastrous to the whole JVM eco system.  We all know what happened to C++.<p>I personally would go with Clojure, which is at least philosophically coherent. I feel comfortable working in it. Even it may not become mainstream, I am OK with that. Life is short, be happy.",1386088409

You should be viewing a system from various angles to help convince you of it&#x27;s reliability.<p>I think these two talks might help explain things.<p><a href=\"http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.confreaks.com/videos/282-lsrc2010-real-software-engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.confreaks.com/videos/282-lsrc2010-real-software-e...</a>",1386087575

Fine-grained control over side effects is only a benefit <i>if you consider it a benefit</i>, and is IMO far from the greatest benefit you can get from a strong, flexible type system. Easy mutability has little to do with type safety—indeed, type safety makes mutability marginally safer by at least holding you to a basic promise when you make mutations. I can&#x27;t deny Scala is heavier than JavaScript, I suppose, for some definition of heavier that I assume means “has more features”, or means something that ends up equating to same.<p>To argue that writing software in <i>both</i> Clojure <i>and</i> Java (or pick 2+ other languages that all run on the JVM, of course) will leave you with an objectively lower complexity:benefit ratio than using a single language is a dubious claim indeed. I don&#x27;t guarantee that just using Scala will always result in a lower such ratio, but you&#x27;d have to make a much better quantitative argument to convince me that you can have a lower ratio consistently by using different languages instead.<p>To deal in increasingly-divergent analogies one more time: if your work is in Las Vegas, you may not care that there are cheap supersonic flights to other cities.

For all I know, he&#x27;s the 18th century&#x27;s Lady Gaga.<p>But not to stop your point right there, I can say that Frank Zappa would qualify as genius for me.

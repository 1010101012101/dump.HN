(Though the real win is: It seems to support <i>every</i> piece of lab hardware by one means or another. This is a difficult feature to give up.) It's the mere mechanics of LabVIEW programming - the need to massage a layout of wires that were difficult to draw, read, print out, diff, or version-control - that used to drive me crazy.<p>Though the last time this came up on HN a National Instruments employee turned up to say that things have improved since last I used LabVIEW. Apparently they've lavished attention on the design problem of virtual-wire layout and tracking.",1347209974

So that's how we end up in a security state and there really isn't anybody accountable for how we got here. Lots of little changes around the edges.<p>We've ended up in a spot where, if you ask a constitutional scholar, they can explain to you how it all works and makes sense. But if you ask the average guy on the street, he'll tell you the system is spinning out of control. There's a serious structural problem when the system has become so byzantine that it requires 6 years of study to understand it all. And most of those guys don't believe that it is fair or correct. We seem to have been overwhelmed by edge cases.",1347209935

4496233,comment,4493280,4493280,3,0,johnbacon,,,"Wow, great job!  For me, it's the video that hooked me. I see the OP and comments focusing around the audio mashup, which is really good. But, the video is what gives the mashup viral legs.<p>Without the high quality and polished video, there is no LMFAO tweet. There's no buzzfeed. There is no radio airplay.  Without the video, the song is confined to SoundCloud and small audiences.<p>The probable virality of Steve's song increased exponentially because of the video. The video is what is being linked to, around the web. From forums, to feeds, to tweets, to DJs.<p>So to Steve, I say thank you for the video. The effort you made in making a front end to your song made me watch it again and again. The polish of your video gave me the desire and confidence to share it with my friends. The video is the reason I downloaded your MP3 and M4A versions, and will be enjoying this song for a long time. (thanks for that).<p>In conclusion: because the backend (audio mashup) is well engineered, it has the potential to scale. Without the frontend (video), the backend goes unnoticed by the masses, save for a few backend junkies. The magic happens because the high quality frontend (video) gives the engineered-to-scale backend (audio mashup) a linkable, shareable, visual interface.<p>Great job! Great lesson! Hope you do more!",1347209758

4496220,comment,4495914,4495914,39,0,crazygringo,,,"There's a lot of food for thought here, and important points. But in one area, the author completely glosses over a crucial distinction:<p>> <i>why is it only documentation of sex crimes against minors that are being banned in this way? The lawmen are perfectly fine with a video documenting how a teenager is being stabbed with a screwdriver in both eyes, then murdered. ... why is the ban just related to anything sexual, and not to the bodily harm itself...?</i><p>There's a very important reason only documentation of sex crimes against minors is banned -- there isn't a big market for watching videos of murders. Virtually no one is going to go out and film themselves murdering people in order to satisfy a market for those videos.<p>But the reasoning goes that if child porn is legal, then this will actively encourage more child rape, etc., so that it can be filmed and distributed. Plus, even if we're really good against preventing the actual acts in the US, we're still creating markets for it in other countries, especially third-world ones. So children suffer.<p>But then there's another argument, that having child porn around is actually <i>better</i> than the alternative -- because potential molesters/rapists are able to satisfy their desire with existing videos. If they don't have the videos, then they go out and commit horrible acts. So, better to stick to the videos.<p>There are no easy answers.",1347209495

You are now a criminal, guilty of recording, distributing, and possessing child pornography.""<p>I find this highly implausible.  Hypotheticals like this damage the argument.  Crimes are caught on camera everyday.  Seems to me the crime here (aside form the rape) is to knowingly destroy evidence of the crime, which the innocent strollers in this scenario are supposedly encouraged to do out fear for themselves.  I have not thought about this enough to have a strong opinion other than simple gut reaction, but it seems more evidence to support this idea in particular is needed.",1347209493

In these cases, the only realistic option for officials is to intercept on or during delivery since the origin address is usually completely fabricated.<p>Part of my role was to assist in the warehousing system to intercept (during transfer to verify that the shipment is in fact illegal) anomalous mailings (much in the way credit card companies try to identify anomalous purchases as fraud). The illegal materials will be shipped in all sorts of interesting ways.

I don't know what node.js did to you (maybe you tried something as writing a whole webframework with node.js? or something as foolish as a file server?), but you should know that there are many projects out there which use node.js where it fits and it's running good (prime examples are Microsoft and LinkedIn).<p><i>> I'm sorry, but if you are only good in JS, or PHP, the very first thing you should do is become good with some better tools.</i><p>And I don't know what the hell is wrong with you, that you assume that you are the wisest of all men and know what is wrong with everything and what to use in any situation and what I know and what I do and what I should do...<p><i>> and have a cost you will pay during the lifetime of your application, in security, reliability, scalability and maintainability.</i><p>So thanks for this lesson.

And that's one thing that's striking about them to me: They look so immediate and real, like they were shot yesterday. This property is something we've been trained to associate with video.</i><p>So, I think this is the crux of the matter.  A trained artist is trained to get the ""HD look"" without the ""Photoshop look"".[1]  Its like fight club: the first rule of using photoshop, is don't let anyone know you are using photoshop.<p>Example. Your mind expects certain relationships to hold - an image subject closer to you  has more resolvable detail than one farther away - for one. A visual cue for relative depth perception: if i can see it better it must be closer.  But, in photoshop, I can differentially sharpen the fore-ground and the back-ground.  If I do this to get a ""uniform"" level of detail,[2] it looks ""high-definition"" because the background has a higher level of detail [sharpness] than it should (according to your brain). But there is no increase in pixel resolution (ie, definition level) An image like this can be almost difficult to mentally process, you will want to look over every inch to take in all the detail. [Note: how this has nothing to do with color - i can pull this off with neutral colors].<p>Now, is this a ""photoshop look""?  Arguably, yes.  To someone that is trained in these techniques.  The idea that one can make a still image look ""cinematic"" HD is actually a good way to put it.<p>So, ""looks like photoshop"" as I was using it may have been not easy to understand.  To many, this might mean ""looks like Glamour photography, with airbrush and vivid colour"".  That is but a tiny subset of cases [popular photography, etc].  Almost all PJ and FA work is heavily (as in 80 layers) photoshopped if its going into a gallery.  But it doesn't ""look like it"", if what you are expecting is something else.  But, if you understand how these images are working, you will see they look nothing like the files that come out of RAW or a Digital scan of the negative.<p>The master of ""HD"" type looks is Gursky [see footnote 1]. His images have no unnatual colours, but the would be impossible without the <i>powerful</i> colour control you get in photoshop. Ie, the irony is that the more agressive you are with the tonal controls, the more you need color control (and 16bits and large color spaces, etc) to keep the <i>normal</i> part of the look.

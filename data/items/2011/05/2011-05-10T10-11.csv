Here's some choice bits:<p>> A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers downloaded on to a device when the user accesses certain websites. Cookies allow a website to recognise a users device.<p>> At present, most browser settings are not sophisticated enough to allow you to assume that the user has given their consent to allow your website to set a cookie.  Also, not everyone who visits your site will do so using a browser.  They may, for example, have used an application on their mobile device.<p>> One possible solution might be to place some text in the footer or header of the web page which is highlighted or which turns into a scrolling piece of text when you want to set a cookie on the users device. This could prompt the user to read further information (perhaps served via the privacy pages of the site) and make any appropriate choices that are available to them.<p>> An analytic cookie might not appear to be as intrusive as others that might track a user across multiple sites but you still need consent.<p>So, anyone in the EU running a website has a choice: Either tank your user engagement rates, confuse and alienate your customers, stop using Google Analytics (unless the user opts in - watch your bounce rate fall to 0%), or willfully disregard EU law.

Normally, they are appointed by the civil service (who obviously aren't elected either) of a country of the EU but sometimes they are appointed by a government.<p>The council is the executive branch of the EU, a bit like the President of America, except with a lot more power (the President of America doesn't have much power on domestic issues).  For example, one of the things that the Council has the power to do is pass new laws, and they can often choose not to put it to a vote in the EU Parliament.  The EU Parliament is elected, but not many people vote or really take an interest in it (good luck finding someone who can name one of their MEPs, or any MEP for that matter).<p>To say that these people have short-term interests or that they are beholden to the electorate or something is factually mistaken.

2531964,comment,2528225,2528225,1,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"This reminds me of a game concept I came up with a while back I called ""Last Man Standing"". Players are put in a 3D world with completely destructible buildings and must hunt each other down one by one until only one player is left. Although it's a free for all, each player is assigned a target and can see where their target is at all times, so there's no hiding. Players can shoot through walls, foundations, and collapse buildings and destroy anything in their way. Because all buildings and obsticals are destructible, eventually there will be nothing left for players to hide behind. Once a player kills his target another is randomly assigned to him. You can also kill other players you meet along your way. Also, your target might be player#12 but his target is someone else. Anyway the gameplay was suppose to be quiet different than most games of the same concept. Instead of hiding and camping, everyone knows where everyone is at and everyone has someone to kill and be killed by. There is no hiding, no camping. And you have to keep moving.<p>I REALLY like Pew Pew Arena and see a lot of potential in it. Honestly, for me, it's much more fun than minecraft for the following reasons:
- I can delete objects from far away
- I can spawn objects from far away
- So I can build and destroy much faster
- Shooting is unlimited
- the world has edges, it doesn't go on forever, it also has a bottom so I can make enemies fall through.<p>I wish:
- there was a secondary weapon like a ""bomb"" that destroys an area the size of 3x3x3 blocks at once. This way it's possible to kill other players by destroying the ground beneath them until they fall through. You can currently do this but it takes way too long to destroy the map block by block.
- when other players are behind blocks or far away and not rendered, an onscreen marker should show up to let you know where they are so you can find them. Bots aren't very good at hiding but when real people start playing, it's going to be really annoying finding them when they're hiding.",1305022009

I'm sure trying to seize the user logs of DDL sites through some form of legal action might be difficult as well.",1305021949

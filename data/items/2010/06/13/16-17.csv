1427673,comment,1426795,1427008,0,0,ashearer,,,"To your point about laying out electronic notes like compact paper notes, the Lifespan system of hospitals in Rhode Island is able to do exactly this. Their residency programs all use a web application that displays fishbones graphically using CSS, and other information in a compact format. I went to some lengths when developing it to abbreviate relevant medications and lab results the way the residents used to on their handwritten notes. They had developed the original format over many years to efficiently convey information, and it made sense to model the electronic version on it.<p>Different services use their own shorthand and prefer different levels of detail on reference printouts. An entire Surgery patient census with demographics, labs, meds, and notes is designed to fit on a single page. (Even at 2-3 lines per patient, the print had to be quite small, but surgeons seem to like that.)<p>I hear that this type of system isn't common, apparently because not many vendors go to the effort. Displaying the fields as they appear in the database also complies with the specification and serves the purpose, just not quite as well.<p>Onscreen, the web application has fewer space constraints and also supports progressive disclosure. For example, abnormal lab results are highlighted on the printout, but their trends and normal ranges are only available by clicking or hovering over the result. Fitting everything onto a single page also becomes less of an issue because you can always jump from patient to patient via a table of contents, without shuffling paper.<p>An iPad or high-resolution device like an iPhone 4 could marry some of the best features of paper and screen: portability, navigation, progressive disclosure, and the ability to edit.",1276447167

1427665,comment,1427542,1427542,0,0,gexla,,,"Niche work might be better than being a more general web developer.  There is less competition and you can generally charge better rates for the niche stuff.  So you might start out looking at what work is out there for the FileMaker side (I know nothing about that.)<p>Also, managing projects isn't a bad way to go.  Making sales is probably the most important part of web development.  If you can make the sales then you could start building a web development team (probably a remote team) and have them do the work while you manage the projects.  This is risky because devs can flake out on your or you could lose money by underestimating jobs but if you get it right then it could be a better money maker than working solo.<p>If none of the above will work for you now, then you might be best off starting out building sites in something like Wordpress, Drupal, ExpressionEngine, etc.  The reason is that there is a huge market for working existing designs (I'm assuming you are a developer as opposed to a designer)into a CMS so the client can easily update the site.  A CMS like Wordpress is pretty easy to get started with, doesn't require a lot of technical skill and often you won't need to do anything crazy with PHP (ExpressionEngine requires little to no PHP knowledge.)<p>This will get you started.  If you feel that you want to go more the route of custom applications rather than working with content management systems then you could start branching out as you get more comfortable with your dev skills.  At this point, go ahead and start researching different scripting languages and the tools / libraries available for each to decide which is the best fit for you.  Again, keep your market in mind for it.  PHP is a great money maker because of the market size, but you also have a lot more low cost competition.  The more niche you go, the lower the competition and the better the rates, but you might also have a harder time finding work.<p>There have been a lot of other posts on hacker news for how to get started.  If you already have a great source of work then you are already ahead of the game.  If not, then you need to start making a name for yourself.  You could hit the pavement and look for local clients but you also need to be able to bring in clients from elsewhere.  Use your knowledge to help people where paying clients hang out (Wordpress help forums for example.)  Build Wordpress add-ons and give them away (but selling add-ons could also be a good money maker.)  Setup Twitter for answering questions and finding people who are looking for paid help.  Build your freelance site and use that site for support for your add-ons and posting tutorial<p>I mentioned Wordpress as an example, but you could substitute that with any CMS.  Potential goldmines are new up and coming systems which have exploding numbers of new users but have a relatively low developer base.  If developers are relatively hard to find, but the demand is high, then you have as much work as you like.  I can't think of any examples off-hand, so you would have to do a bit of searching.  Also, paid systems are great because the clients interested in those systems are already willing to dish out some cash and lower paid competition generally sticks with free systems.<p>As for advancing technology, it doesn't change as fast as you might think.  The bleeding edge moves fast and you have to keep training yourself, but the edge must still keep the caboose in sight.<p>Bonus:  Learn Javascript as well as one of the more popular frameworks such as Jquery.  It doesn't matter which server side scripting language you learn, you will be using JS.",1276446857

Google hopes that this will allow them to do with ad-hoc processes in spreadsheets what they did with web links: organize and unify a huge collection of disparate linkages to create value.  When a company has all of its spreadsheets in Google apps, users will be able to link data in disparate spreadsheets.  This network of links will be subject to analysis.  New business processes will be absorbed from the ad-hoc spreadsheets into the enterprise more quickly and efficiently.  This will have tremendous value to companies, especially small and medium sized ones, some of which will grow into giant conglomerates.  If this works, Google stands to dwarf the achievements of Microsoft.<p>EDIT: This remote desktop stuff is just a selling point in support of larger goals.",1276446513
1427646,comment,1427291,1427291,0,0,Tycho,,,"To summarize, the reviewer likes Ayn Rand and her work but thinks the author's life showed a huge capacity for self-deception because:\na) as a kid in Russia, she was really into novels\nb) she had a higher opinion of the man she loved than others did\nc) she moved from a ranch in California to NYC, and was convinced this was best for her actor-husband\nd) she took amphetamines (under doctor's prescription)\ne) was publicly bitter about a perceived betrayal by another lover\nf) claimed no philosophical debt except to Aristotle (she has received no scholarly attention by the students/disciples of subsequent philosophy anyway)<p>Frankly this is phenomenally small beer compared to the sins of other philosophers or influential intellectuals. And I find the obsession with Rand gossip amongst her detractors pretty stupid.<p>The reviewer also dismisses 'Objectivism' and says the novels are the important thing. But actually the novels contain most of the philosophical meat of Objectivism - the subsequent  non-fiction is more like footnotes/endnotes, collections of essays that relate ideas from AS to real-world history and economic theory. <i>An Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</i> does contain many new ideas though, but it's only 50 pages or so and is fairly a-political. I suppose the start of <i>The Virtue of Selfishness</i> contains a couple of essential ideas one might not pick up from the novels (ie. why you <i>can</i> get ought from is), although that could be seen as overly intellectual 'who cares' territory (as most people perceive the whole field of philosophy)",1276446490

1427640,comment,1419388,1419388,0,0,cianestro,,,"I have many friends who are much less intelligent than I who are attending ""better"" schools for infuriatingly trivial reasons. Getting good grades has as much to do with intelligence as it does with your ability to take tests--unless you come across a really good teacher. Forget about dreams of elitist schools (for now) and find/start a project to build a knowledge base around. Make sure it's something you have the resources for and also is big enough to require you to learn new subjects. This project will serve as your point of reference for ""building"" new learning habits quite organically around. It will tell you what, how, why, and with whom you will learn with versus vague ideals and arbitrary academia romanticism dictating your future. However, realize the project itself is merely a crutch for your brain to grow stronger on--you will eventually outgrow it and require a new one. Walk into a professor's office, they are very lonely and love attention, and I guarantee you they are working on something you could define as a ""project"" and would love to point you in the right direction. Most have to in order to keep their jobs. Undergraduate students have a hard time understanding that they need some sort of internal locus and not their friends and teachers in order to be intelligent--but they eventually catch on to this like you have just now. The hardest part will be the sacrifices you'll have to make and endure in every imaginable facet of your life; you'll have to cut a lot of loose ends (bad habits/routines) off from your life. Eventually, though, you'll find <i>your</i> path to enlightenment and it's always one with heart and is rarely found but more so stumbled upon (hint: always within close proximity of powerful computers and by path I mean nerd and by stumbled upon I mean HN). Only then, once found, will you know if you will <i>need</i> to attend a particular school or not. (good music helps to rewire your brain and the subsequent lonely spells; cats are smart because they're curious, not the other way around; also, the smarter you get the more you laugh...muhahahah)<p><i>...sooner or later you're going to realize just as I did that there's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.</i> - Morpheus",1276446356

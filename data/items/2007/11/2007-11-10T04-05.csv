I've seen pinball, foosball, ping pong, and pool all work well in an office setting, but video games are generally too involved for the casual 15min distraction. Unless, of course, you're making video games.",1194670658

Proprieters hate it when we hog the booths, and we hate it when they charge for wireless.  <p>Give me a place catered to the entrepreneurial types.  BUT maintain the social+creative coffee shop vibe... I'm thinking along the lines of Diesel Cafe, not the Cambridge Innovation Center.<p>Charge membership fees, serve healthy meals, be open 24 hours, whatever.  Start with Cambridge, then franchise around the world.<p>Naturally, there'd be an online component... your Hackspot account gives you access to the network, job board, etc etc.<p>Anyone know anything about starting a company in meatspace?  =P

Sloppy structural analysis? Bad materials? The contractor didn't follow the specifications? You can know <i>exactly</i> what went wrong.",1194668746

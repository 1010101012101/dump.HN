Why does the best medium for a storyteller have anything to do with how profitable it is or how many consumers access your work? If these are your goals then you aren&#x27;t going to create anything very good.  If you disagree then you probably think that only very popular things are any good.<p>Here&#x27;s the future of any story teller: smaller.<p>The 20th century was about Top 40 radio, blockbuster movies, and the New York Times bestseller list. The 21st century is about variety. The behemoths of the last century are still shaping the marketplace and it will take them a while to die. DRM, region-lock, and vendor-log are symptoms of this disease. The future is about unrestricted sharing, crowd-funding, DRM-free and _low cost_ media.  A dollar here and there so everything is an impulse – small communities sharing the things they love instead of national best sellers.<p>Vimeo does a pretty good job.  Netflix is more of an iteration on the last century, it&#x27;s pretty great, but not the end-all.<p>The future of creativity is about dealing with the lack of limits.  Old microphones, amplifiers, and vinyl meant that with the restrictions of the media, what you had either sounded good or really terrible.  New technology makes it really easy to be mediocre and terrible at the same time – being good without the restrictions of old is really hard.<p>The future of selling is about the slow exit of capitalism – crowd funding, open source, community support ... being creative without worrying about sales or buying your next meal ... this is the future which is hard to get to but the beginning is here.  This is not Carl Marx&#x27;s communism but a different sort of post-scarcity capitalism where automation makes resources cheap enough that the cost of them loses importance. It&#x27;ll be difficult and weird, but it&#x27;ll happen one way or the other.<p>Then again, none of this has a whole lot to do with actually telling stories, something which isn&#x27;t about money or viewers, but about the act of creation which is still done with words and songs and pictures, new technology is a new playground that doesn&#x27;t obsolete the old but adds to the new.",1435643780

9803184,comment,9802927,9802927,0,0,sova,,,"Well, your question asks on a few different levels.  There is the personal level, the societal/community level, and the over-encompassing reality.<p>On the personal level, we&#x27;re restricted somewhat by our current situation, so you have free will like a stream has the ability to curve paths down a mountain.  It could go left or right, but every decision branches, and if the stream is going quickly, there is less choice involved, whereas if it is running slowly or smoothly, there is a lot of directability.<p>On the societal level, our basic premise here in the United States is that we are all entitled to life liberty and property, and conventionally we extend this to happiness.  Actions that don&#x27;t impinge on another citizen&#x27;s path to these are considered alright, and I think that is a fine way to be: don&#x27;t harm others.  Why?  Well you wouldn&#x27;t want it to happen to you, and in the world of generalities (and overall reality) you could just as easily have been born on the other end of that string/strand.<p>Then what would absolute free will be?  Well, the ability to change your body shape, change your environment by thinking.. perhaps even with less effort than is involved in &quot;thinking&quot; with words and images.  It&#x27;s an interesting question, but in general free will is the ability to direct your flow, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily entail being able to change the pre-existing flow, unless you mean gradually.  I find the river and stream metaphor extremely valuable in this context, and have heard karma spoken of in a similar fashion.<p>Everything dissolves, you can make skillful actions and direct your stream to goodness.  Ideally, intelligent and sensitive people are directing their flows to unbound potential, because as you can see, it is easy to continue into a spiral that minimizes, whereas it is actually possible with effort to &quot;flow back up&quot; the mountain, coming to a place of total potential, where you might be able to experience or talk about an &quot;absolute free will&quot;<p>Thus, in my simpleton opinion, free will is not an absolute unless you are directing your own capacities toward the experience of an absolute freedom.<p>The Supreme Court thing... could you provide an example?",1435643565

9803180,comment,9801904,9801904,0,0,hasenj,,,"I&#x27;m not familiar with this particular experiment, but all my pondering on the subject - as a layman - leads me to a simple conclusion.<p>The properties these experiments are measuring are simply bogus. They are not well defined. The answer that comes out is not some intrinsic property of the &quot;particle&quot;, but the result of the environment in which the particle interacted with the &quot;measurement&quot; system, so to speak.<p>The particle has some other properties, but what&#x27;s being &quot;measured&quot; is not one of those properties.<p>How can I explain?<p>Imagine someone who has never tried any Korean food, and you try to ask him/her: what&#x27;s your favorite Korean food? There&#x27;s no answer. So you try to &quot;measure&quot; it by feeding him some Korean items and recording his facial expressions. He will like some items more than others, but it has nothing to do with &quot;his favorite Korean food&quot;, and has more to do with how the items were prepared and his mood at the time.<p>A &quot;point&quot; location for a photon is never defined; it&#x27;s not a property of a photon that it exists in a point in space. When you fire a photon at a &quot;wall&quot; and see a &quot;blip&quot;, you&#x27;re not seeing the position of the photon at some point in time. You&#x27;re seeing the rough position of the atom that had an electron that absorbed the photon&#x27;s energy, and I&#x27;m not even sure the atom has a well defined point position either. The whole thing is an artifact (a side effect) of some interaction between several systems and doesn&#x27;t really tell you anything fundamental about the photon (or the quantum object).<p>At least that&#x27;s how I understand it.",1435643534

But if my choices were working for them or quitting the industry, I wouldn&#x27;t blink.<p>For me it&#x27;s more the accumulation of awfulness. They started out as a scheme to time-share limos among young entitled dudebros. They entered the market with the black cars, exploiting a status-good dynamic. They&#x27;ve shifted all of the capital cost and risk of the taxi business to drivers, surely screwing many of them in the process. Their &quot;we&#x27;re too important to comply with mere laws&quot; routine strikes me as arrogant horseshit. They&#x27;ve had assorted scandals, including inviting a bunch of journalists to an off-the-record dinner and then &quot;joking&quot; about plans to spend lots of money to destroy the career of a prominent journalist they didn&#x27;t like. I&#x27;ve lost count of how many places have arrested or issued arrest warrants for their people.<p>Throughout all of this, they sing a song of &quot;entrepreneurship&quot; and &quot;worker independence&quot; while providing low-quality, low-stability jobs and making long-term plans to put every one of their drivers out of work. They couldn&#x27;t give a shit about their workers, and are even willing to threaten their jobs (which aren&#x27;t jobs, of course, but independent contractor positions) if they are politically active.<p>On top of all of that, I believe they&#x27;re a great example of the shift back to a new gilded age, where the main function of the poor is to directly serve the wealthy. But instead of a Victorian model where employees are part of the household, in the Uber model we&#x27;ll get paid only during the instants we are directly useful to somebody with money.<p>That&#x27;s just some highlights off the top of my head; the list goes on.

If you really only had one assignment to x,

The fact that history has attributed some very negative actions to the belief in this concept (Hitler, Leopold & Loeb&#x27;s murder, etc.) is, in my opinion, not definitive but at the same time not entirely insignificant, but I&#x27;m also a Christian that believes in capital-M Morality so I&#x27;m biased against nihilism in general.<p>here&#x27;s a thought I had a few months ago: how have there not been more thought pieces relating Uber-the-business&#x27;s recent/relentless PR-debacles to Nietzsche&#x27;s Ubermensch concept? I guess I&#x27;ll give it a go.<p>Uber/Travis and his execs seem to demonstrate the belief that they are &quot;overmen&quot; in that they seem to believe that they transcend the rules of society and are destined to shape society and its values rather than the other way around (probably something not too uncommonly shared with HN readers…).<p>A few fun/funny/serious examples (in no particular order):
1. They outrightly express resistance to laws-as-is, and regularly threaten to ignore and sometimes do break those regs as necessary to conduct their business / benefit themselves and their consumers.<p>2. They hire lobbyists and other high-level political actors to change the laws they don&#x27;t like and/or influence lawmakers - not atypical for a large company, but they did this earlier than most companies at their stage, with much more specific agendas in place and with a lot more PR surrounding it (the last may or may not have been their doing, hard to say). They have a belief (probably well-founded) that they can use the political process to make the law bend to their will. “Creating New Values” as any good uberman should.<p>3. They call their central system “Godmode” which implies that they, the viewers, are like God (a bit of a stretch I know…couldn’t resist)<p>4. They are proud that using the data in Godmode they can track, predict and identify specifics of other human being’s behavior.<p>5. The whole “we’ll pay our own researchers to smear journalists” thing - another good example of Creating New Values and constructing narratives.<p>6. The general feeling that Uber (perhaps correctly) operates against “states” and “sovereigns” and “systems” more than corporate competitors (who even writes about Lyft anymore these days…)<p>The funny thing is that after thinking this through, all (good?) CEOs of major corporations basically operate like this (and so do many other tech-leaders - it is often associated with libertarian-leaning individuals like P. Thiel, etc.) - the difference is that Uber (1) has a name that calls it out and (2) seems to be especially prone to doing this in public and (3) sometimes appears to relishes their “overlord-iness” a little too much. You can call it being crass or being honest.
In any case, they seem to be getting hip to the system and playing nice which of course can be viewed as just another level of the game, etc. - still, glad to see them do it because I overall think that playing nice is best (especially when you can afford to do it) and with a $50b val. and a couple billion raised, I think they can spare some good behavior, at least for now =)",1435641126

A couple of remarks:<p>1 - I don&#x27;t know if you are aware, but there seems to be a bug for lack of a better word.<p>How to reproduce it:<p>- Get on the site (not logged in).<p>- I&#x27;m interested in Python for now, so I scroll down to the bottom and click Python in the &quot;Languages&quot; list.<p>- ISSUE: This doesn&#x27;t take me to anything Python related, it only takes me to: <a href=""https://www.livecoding.tv/livestreams/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.livecoding.tv/livestreams/</a>.<p>- So then I have to click on &quot;Category>Python&quot;.<p>- ISSUE: It still doesn&#x27;t take me to anythong Python related,  it only takes me to: <a href=""https://www.livecoding.tv/videos/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.livecoding.tv/videos/</a><p>- So then I have to click on &quot;Category>Python&quot; again, and finally this takes me to: <a href=""https://www.livecoding.tv/videos/python/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.livecoding.tv/videos/python/</a><p>Maybe I&#x27;m not really tech savvy, but I think it&#x27;s too many clicks.<p>2 - When I&#x27;m about to sign in with a GitHub account, it says &quot;Livecodingtv by @MrTomato8 would like permission to access your account&quot;. Now, I know it&#x27;s a serious YC funded company and all, but giving information to Livecodingtv would be easier if it weren&#x27;t a MrTomato8 asking.<p>Furthermore, when I click on the GitHub profile, it takes me to MrTomato8 with only one contribution in the last year. This doesn&#x27;t sell very well for an entity having a channel about coding. I assume the GitHub profile doesn&#x27;t necessarily reflect on MrTomato8&#x27;s real skills, but it just doesn&#x27;t look right for that profile to be asking me, a beginner who wants to stand on the shoulders of giants, for information.<p>Keep it up and I look forward to signing up in the near future.",1435640618

It is permissible for an implementation to not provide a large enough integer type, but excepting that, the behavior is well defined.",1435640587

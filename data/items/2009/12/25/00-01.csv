We're a middle-man between clothing suppliers and groups of students. Our selling point is the ease of group-ordering. Our margins are a lot higher than around 3% gross but we have a very niche focus. Another startup in the UK, <a href=""http://www.wigadoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wigadoo.com</a>, tried to do lead-gen for group-bookings of holidays and really struggled. They folded around August 09. Group ordering is definitely an interesting space.

You should be able to pick the signals up without severing any wires or actually connecting anything to the wires themselves. You would have to split the outer jacket of the cat5 cable, but once you isolate the pairs you should be able to get something going. The pairs are differential loops, so you should need only one inductive pickup per pair. Just an idea, not sure how feasible it would be, but I would have thought that this would be a standard way to do a tap. You'd need power for this though, so maybe that limits its usefulness.

It took literally hours to get sunburnt.  Here, I think 30 minutes is about all the average Australian can take, and for a recent arrival from Europe, 15 minutes will do them in, and 2 or 3 hours will put them in hospital.<p>My personal theory is that there is a lot more airborne pollution in Europe, and because of all the air traffic a lot of high-level cloud gets laid down by planes.  You'll note the sky is never as deep blue as it is in Australia. I also think that because of the tilt in the Earth's axis, the SH summers receive a more directly overhead sun than even on the summer solstice in most of Europe.  Finally my theory rounds out that, in Europe, periods of hot sunny weather seem to coincide with long periods of stable weather with little wind, when the pollution quicklyk builds.  In Australia, in summer (in much of the country) the really hot days come during the thunderstorm period, when the high wind and heavy rain blows all the pollution away, and the next day is scorchingly hot.<p>Of course, all just random theories but based on a lot of observation.",1280324616

It's extremely liberating, if only a little lonely at the beginning of each week.<p>It's not hard to switch back and forth as long as you use one of the bedtimes that's normal for both schedules and just wake up with an alarm when you're supposed to on the new one.<p>The best thing about it was that I was actually tired (on the 20/8 variation) when it was time to go to bed, and I usually woke up a few minutes before my alarm starting on about the third day.  These two phenomena never happen with any variation on a 24 hour day that I've tried.  I was more productive (got my normal work done; started cycling regularly again; wrote more; and was averaging 2-3 books per week) and happier.  I can't think of anything bad to say about it except that the last few hours of each ""day"" are a bit sluggish.

1554262,comment,1550974,1551262,0,0,flatulent1,,,"I believe that vitamin D is best taken with and is absorbed in and later stored in fat (and the liver).<p>Excessive amounts of animal fat are bad since it is a saturated fat, but some is beneficial.  I suspect that range fed beef has more vitamin D since animals in the open get more sun and would store vitamin D in a smaller amount of fat built up over more time.<p>Obese corn fed feed lot cattle are less healthy for other reasons also.  The corn diet is very unnatural for them.  It leads to rapid fat buildup with some meats containing over four times the fat of range fed animals.  The diet causes the digestive system to become more acidic making the animals prone to various infections including E-coli a very dangerous bacteria.  The E-coli mutates in the overly acidic animals becoming a form which humans often can't fight off without antibiotics if it wasn't already killed in cooking.  The E-coli in range fed animals is not so troublesome.  Bacterial that does survive in the animals loaded with antibiotics is also apt to be more resistant to treatment.<p>Because of the the danger of E-coli, ground beef must be cooked well done all the way through.  Slaughter exposes meat from other parts of the animal to the bacteria and if gets mixed all the way through when ground.  Other beef should be eaten fresh and washed well before cooking, and utensils and cutting boards used with the raw meat should be kept separate from those used for vegetables and other foods.  Besides tasting better, non-ground beef is more nutritious if the color isn't cooked out.  Meat that's still juicy contains a fair amount of iron in the blood.<p>PBS in the US has been running a documentary about corn production in Iowa.  The subsidized inedible corn (tastes like cardboard, engineered for high yield per acre) is used mainly as cattle feed and to produce high fructose corn syrup, a non-nutritious addictive destructive AND CHEAP sweetener that's found its way into many of our foods.  It's hurting us not only when consumed directly, but by degrading the beef produced as explained above. People consume more saturated fat in the beef.  The excess fat and sugar has caused a major increase in diabetes in the last 20 years.<p>Although supplements help with vitamin D problems, we really should be looking closely at what we eat and how it is produced.  END CORN SUBSIDIES!!!  contact your representatives.  The corn isn't profitable without subsidies, farmers (big business now) would switch to nutritious crops if not paid to do the wrong thing.<p>U.S. broadcasting has become dangerously consolidated in the hands of a small number of corporations and even more insidious venture capital groups.  Pressure the F.C.C. and your representative for change, and watch and support your P.B.S. (non profit community tv) stations.<p>For all of us to be healthier we should step back and see what's going on, be educated, produce healthy foods, eat properly, and live a healthier lifestyle.

Software that doesn't require <i>thinking</i> is a bit boring, even if there are parts like that in all software.<p>Personally, my respect for the company would increase if I solved a fairly difficult programming problem, and they interviewed heavily on working with other people's code, and making your code able to be worked on by other people (this is a kinda hefty topic...). I'd be pretty assured that I would be working in an intellectually stimulating environment with competent peers -- and that would be awesome.<p>I'm not aware of many other companies that put out ""solve a problem"" types of hiring screenings, other than google.",1280322610

Basically too much such/alcohol/yeast causes a yeast build up in my GI tract.  This causes major issues like:<p>- fatigue (I was falling asleep at my desk at 10:30am after 11 hours of sleep)\n- ""Brain fog"" (Best definition I've heard, it's the lack of the ability to focus after about 10 minutes etc)\n- Depression (This came on when I would have too much sugar.  It would really mess with my head)<p>Anyways, after some anti-fungals and cutting out most sugars from my diet, I'm 80% better now.  I can put in a full day's work and can hang out at night without feeling repercussions the next day.<p>I also found out I was celiac.  Go figure.",1280322355

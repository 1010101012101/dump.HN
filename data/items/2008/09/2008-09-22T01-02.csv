Your concerns are hardly new, and there's a lot of history to draw upon.<p>A moderate balance of faith in something greater than ourselves, humility, and the ability to hold reason as the highest of all virtues seems to work best -- or at least it has in our country's history.<p>Pure faith and pure logic alone are funny things -- they tend to bend to the emotional and cultural currents of those espousing them. And usually without the person's awareness.<p>We've had radical swings between rationalism (such as when we were founded), to faith, back to rationalism again, and back to faith. Each generation feels like it is the first or the only one going through something. We've been here before, and we'll be here again.<p>Hope I'm not trolling for an argument.

When you have it mastering you; when interest is constantly piling up against you, it will keep you down in the worst kind of slavery. But let money work for you, and you have the most devoted servant in the world. It is no ""eye-servant."" There is nothing animate or inanimate that will work so faithfully as money when placed at interest, well secured. It works night and day, and in wet or dry weather.</i>",1222048019

You're still too small for institutional investors, and you're large for an angel round. A typical angel might put in anywhere from $25k-$100k. I'd guess $50k to be the median, meaning you're looking at having to find 6-10 people.<p>You're in good shape given your traffic and revenue, so I'm not trying to suggest that you won't be able to do it.

310721,comment,310511,310511,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Interesting article and source. Lots of material.<p>I've seen this criticized by both the left, right, and populists positions.<p>I DO think this article mischaracterizes the situation. The situation, as I understand it, is a crisis of confidence and liquidity. The impact was described to senior congressional leaders as being able to quickly spread to the entire credit industry. That means retail credit, auto loans, bridge loans -- everything that makes our system work was at risk of shutting down.<p>That's why the blank check: to buy unknown risk now and then auction it off later. I'm not getting into the politics of it, aside from simply stating I doubt Paulson is going off to buy his own country or moon base (which he could probably afford!) and that the more complicated you make the deal, the more you start defeating the entire purpose of an executive branch in the first place -- some things respond better to a single-decision-making point instead of a committee. But if you're worried, call your congressmen and by all means tell him/her how you feel.<p>My concern is I'm just not sure the fundamentals of the problem are being solved, and I wonder how you can fix something while keeping the system in place that caused the problem in the first place. In my opinion, this problem is just another normal swing in the capitalist system, whereby people looking to game the system figure out something that can't work long-term and the system eventually stresses out. We usually tweak the rules and we move towards a new excess in 10-20 years. I'm concerned that I'm not hearing anything about the ""tweaking"". As I understand it, Congress is going to be working through all of that.<p>It's going to be really hard for a committee made up of political hacks to publicly figure out what went wrong in the middle of an election cycle without degenerating in schoolyard name-calling. Oddly enough, it's much easier just to authorize Treasury to spend some money. That doesn't give me a warm and fuzzy feeling, but I do think immediate action is necessary and I'm at least happy that Congress can come around to getting this one thing accomplished.",1222046636

If the third party in question wants to allow requests-on-behalf-of, they should provide a proper API for it; if not, you shouldn't be working against their wishes by impersonating your users.</i><p>This is true, but unfortunately we live in the real world, and hacks are sometimes necessary.  Look at Mint.com, for example.  Give some site all your banking details?  WHOA THERE.  But it turns out the service is very useful, and it works with pretty much every bank.

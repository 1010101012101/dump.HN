It's certainly not the <i>only</i> causation, but it would be ludicrous to say they weren't related. It <i>is</i> rather ludicrous to talk about global warming and crime, unless you can come up with a truly plausible mechanism for it.<p>And I'm certainly not being contrarian either. I'm saying that the argument that ""life went on"" even when the government had no wiretapping ability, has no relevance here. You might as well say that life went on in the gulags in Russia. <i>That's</i> the point I'm arguing -- that ""life went on"" is not a valid argument in any context, because it's generic and doesn't address any of the actual issues.<p>Oh well, go ahead and downvote away... it's only numbers! :P",1336193984

But it sounds like you are still tens of thousands of dollars underwater in opportunity cost.  Is it wrong to think about it that way?<p>You get ""more than half"" $3400/month, let's call that $1700/month over the last two years, for $40,800.  The two of you spent two man-months developing the app originally, and maybe a month or two since then.  Let's call that 3.5 man-months.  In some sense, your only cost was about $4,100 (cost of living + failed designer + $500).  However, you could also have just worked for someone else.  Two years ago (when you developed the app), it looks like iOS development was getting billed at about $150/hr (in Austin, SF, and elsewhere, though one guy in Ann Arbor quoted $75/hr) [1].  3.5 work months is about 595 work hours which is about $89,250.  (Put another way, if your contracting hourly rate would have been $70/hour, you would have just broken even now.)  If that math is correct (and I've made all sorts of assumptions), you would have done financially better to work for someone else (especially someone at the top of the charts), no?  In a sense, did you ""spend $100,000 on an app"" in opportunity cost?  How long do you estimate your app will continue paying out a ""dividend""?<p>It sounds like you are saying: apps don't make that much money, so don't spend lots of money developing them.  But apps seem to take at least a few months to develop, so it seems inevitable that apps will cost a lot of money if the developer/designer time is market price.  (A <$10,000 app in 3.5 months would be an hourly rate of <$17/hr, for example.)  Is that true, and if so, do you think aspects of that will change over time?<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1251155"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1251155</a>",1336191747

And you're not asking juries broad questions like ""who is right about string theory?"" you're asking them very pointed questions like ""did X present sufficient evidence to show that Y is true?"" Even in a technical trial, you're not asking the jury technical questions like whether some code implements quick-sort or bubble sort. The law by and large doesn't deal in those sorts of questions and as a result those questions don't get posed to the jury.<p>Look at the questions posted: <a href=""http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20120504153813681"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20120504153813681</a><p>""B. Has Google proven that its use of Oracles Java documentation constituted fair use?""<p>The judge will explain in detail what ""fair use"" means according to the law. The factors of fair use are something like this:<p>1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;<p>2) the nature of the copyrighted work;<p>3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and<p>4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.<p>An average person can evaluate whether Google's use of Oracle's documentation was commercial or educational. They can be made to understand the difference between documentation and actual code that makes a product work. They can be made to understand the difference between a few lines of code and a program containing millions of lines. They can hear evidence from experts about the potential impact of the use and decide who they find more credible.<p>It's not like on TV where there is a ""guilty/non-guilty"" verdict. The juries are asked very specific things that are expected to be within the range of comprehension of an ordinary person.",1336191494

It has worked wonders for Portugal in the war on drugs, and TBH, I think it would work well for a lot more types of social ills. Criminalization marginalizes those that engage in undesirable activities and pushes them underground and as far away from any sort of help to help them overcome the problem.<p>It's possible that such an approach would have some intended consequences like the abuses we see in the psychiatric community of the problemization of every behavior that isn't considered ""normal"", but this would be far better than the current prison-industrial complex that promotes an incarceration system that exarberates the problem instead of promoting healing.<p>A classic example of a social ill that the FBI likely exploiting to justify the passage of this law that would probably better solved with social solutions is child pornography. I seriously would be surprised if most sexual predators of children don't first start off as casual consumers of child porn and things worsen from them. Dealing it as a social problem probably leaves a lot more room for those people to seek psychiatric treatment early on instead of promoting avoidance behaviors that allows consumption to grow unnoticed by those close to the person with the problem.<p>I'd much rather see a Federal Bureau for the Study and Treatment of Social Ills.",1336191262

I'm actually probably close to your target audience.<p>I've been using git as a single developer in a very timid way for years. This is my public repo <a href=""https://github.com/marshray"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/marshray</a> . I know how to 'add' and 'commit -m ...' and 'push'. Anything else I usually have to look up. Just yesterday I actively collaborated for the first time and did a fastforward pull and a merge a few times. Scared me to death I was going to screw something up because we had a hard deadline.<p>When I followed the link on HN, I didn't know what it was. I thought you might be starting a GitHub competitor service. It's a pretty design, but the first two paragraphs I skimmed over. I already know what git is or I wouldn't be on the site. I actually know quite a bit about how git compares to those other products because I've used most of them. But the graph with the stack of books on the right reminds me ""gee I know exactly how to do that in Perforce, I wish it would just sink in how to do it with git. The branch diagrams still look like Feynman diagrams to me and I don't know quantum physics"".<p>I saw the 'About, Documentation, Downloads, Community'. All very obvious categorizations, but here's was my first impression:<p>About - yes I've figured out by now this is a website about git, and already know what git is about<p>Downloads - I've never downloaded git except via a package manager so this is probably not useful to me<p>Documentation - ok <i>that</i> could be helpful, but I have no sense at this point if it's any good. You know a lot of sites amount to mostly just manpages.<p>Community get involved! - I'm not so invested in git that I would want to join a list about it. I feel grateful for the community because when I have questions a web search usually turns up an appropriate discussion. But usually it's a blog post or stack overflow. I don't recall a mailing list or a forum post being helpful, but probably it has and I've just forgotten.<p>I saw the picture of the book. ""Oh yes, the black and yellow publisher"" I thought. Its bold colors visually dominated everything else on the page. I suspected that the site may be a guy who wrote a book on git and this is his personal site.<p>I saw all the list of logos of companies using git and thought ""I wonder if he got permission for all of those, wow that must have taken a lot of emails"". But that's just how my mind works.<p>At this point I closed the page, not having any pressing need to interact or explore the site.<p>I totally didn't notice the Mac on the right hand side.<p>I read the HN discussion a little bit. Mostly I found myself replying to the guy who said the slogan (which I didn't even notice) was reinforcing gender stereotypes. Reading a few more comments it starts to dawn on me: ""OH! This is that same git-scm site I think I've been to before. The one that had the good manual on how to use git in some practical situations..."" I remembered it fondly, though not very clearly because I wasn't a very frequent visitor.<p>I see someone mention in an HN comment that a Mac appears when Javascript is disabled. I had totally tuned it out before but now it looks ridiculous. Why in the world would the primary choice be to download for Mac? Why would the only other platform download be for Windows? (But it's good to know there may be a supported option for Windows if I ever need it.)<p>To explore further, I click on 'Documentation' as it's the only link that remotely seems like something useful to my forseeable needs. My eyes go to the picture of the book ""Reference manual"" OK there's the printout of the man pages I guess. Scanning down I see ""Getting started, Git basics, ... yawn standard stuff""<p>For some reason, I scroll down a bit. WOW! brightly colored business cards! ""<i>Git Basics</i> What is version control?"" The title seems useless, but I'm more focused on trying to figure out what these very visually distinctive rectangles are doing below the fold on a table of contents. OH WOW these are Videos! Earlier today I'd had a passing thought about watching some video on git when I was at O'Reilly's site for DRM-free day. They'd had a 6 hour video you could download for $40 or something. That wasn't in my price range, but these videos could be worth watching.<p>So sorry if I didn't pick up on the visual appeal of your redesign, but I hope my best effort at describing the state of my mind in retrospect will be helpful to you or others in your web design endeavors.",1336191013

1567145,comment,1566422,1566859,0,0,barrkel,,,"My personal catharsis was a grunt of ""hmph"". For a split second I considered the ""question"" of the spinning top - is this real or not - then noticed that I didn't care, that it was a banal and uninteresting question, because the question relied on its very existence for its interestingness, as either answer - it's a dream, or it's the final reality - were both cop-outs, were both unsatisfying and cheaply done. ""It's all a dream"" is the most childish of story resolutions, while the idyllic literal interpretation of the shown ending is unacceptably saccharine for something purporting to be adult entertainment.<p>As to feeling that you have the answer in a dream, that's down to the extreme suspension of disbelief the dozing mind is capable of. That suspension was something that a movie allegedly about dreams hardly ever brought up. If some character can dream up bigger guns, and another character a freight train in a city street, then why not more? And why are the defensive projections of the dream's owner so tame, merely human, when they could potentially be changing the whole world? And if being weightless at one level creates weightlessness in the next level down, why isn't it transitive? And wouldn't dreaming that the entire building / local area / whatever starts accelerating skywards at 9.8 meters per second per second restore gravity? Why can't that manipulation be used as ""the kick""? Seems like a simpler manipulation than what the architect was up to.",1280735966
1567144,comment,1566278,1567068,0,0,naradaellis,,,"Perhaps the reason that Haskellers don't describe monads as ""just sections of the program that are imperative"" is because that statement is _not_ true.<p>A monad is a very nice container abstraction - period.<p>The IO part of Haskell just happens to leverage monads. One of the benefits of which is an explicit marking of impure methods in the type signature, but there are others.<p>Monads are used in plenty of purely functional parts of Haskell.<p>Disclosure: been programming Haskell for only a few months now, so someone pull me up if I'm wrong. However, I have used a lot of monads so far (and they're not hard, its just a higher, more convenient level of abstraction).<p>edit: to address your post further. I honestly don't think that the community is the reason that Haskell isn't taking off. If you were to gather stats on the points at which would-be Haskellers give up, I think most people would leave 1) when they can't grok the syntax easily or 2) when they can't get tools or libraries going easily (it was a problem for me) and long before they get to the point of visiting the news groups and start running up against academic-type people.",1280735715

I'm lost as to the profound meaning you're alluding to; is it doubting reality, that it may be a dream, etc.? That's a long way short of original, and besides, it was done much better recently by The Matrix. The plot, however, was clearly less than awesome, with much of it seemingly existing to justify special effects and repetitive fight scenes, providing cheap tension. (The same could of course be said of The Matrix.)<p>The whole concept of Inception, of course, is unremarkable. Ad-men have been putting ideas in people's heads for some time with quite a degree of sophistication, and magicians have been doing similar for far longer; done well, marks are fooled by both without realizing how or when.<p>Reading the movie as an allegory of movie-making I think is a stretch.

Not having insurance would be an insane level of risk to put on your family (especially when coupled with the risk of a start up).  One of the bigger mistakes the US did with health care IMO was letting companies pay it for the employees.

1567089,comment,1565674,1566998,0,0,ibejoeb,,,"Neeleshs' reply is what I meant.  In Postgres, it's like a namespace.<p>But you have a point: adding customer_id is not unreasonable.  In fact, this is my preferred logical approach, but I'll typically only do this on Oracle.  It's DRY, meaning that, in the abstract definition of schema, you're modeling your relations once.  If you have widgets belonging to customers, you have a one widgets relation containing a customer id, rather than one widgets relation in each customer schema.  It's an elegant design, and it takes even greater advantage of the benefits I described earlier.<p>I'd advocate against it when building a multitenant SaaS application on Postgres if the following hold:\n1. You have many, many customers\n2. Each customer has a lot of data<p>The reasons:<p>1. You'll quickly hit a place where it's hard to throw more vertical processing power at it.  You'll need a serious SAN with lots of spindles to be able to service many request to a lot of data, and plenty of CPU and RAM to handle the grunt work. Let's face it: you're on Postgres because you're broke :)  I really love it, but sometimes I'd rather buy a solution to a problem (e.g., VPD).  However, if you're rolling out schemas, you can build a new database and move them discretely.  This isn't automatic or transparent, but it's very clean and very easy.<p>2. You're likely dealing with clients with special needs.  It might not be appropriate to roll out new features to every customer all at the same time.  If you ALTER TABLE widgets... it's all or nothing.  Sometimes that's great, but sometimes it's not, and in building multitenant SaaS apps, I find it's most often not.  In repeating your design, you're buying the flexibility to deal with your customers on a more granular level.<p>3. Others have already mentioned this: sometimes it's easier to articulate the integrity of your system to technical auditors with a hard separation like independent schemas.  It's a little easier to show that a particular database account has access only to a particular schema than it is to convince him that your code does a sufficient job of enforcing the rules.  I've done a lot of work where regulatory compliance is a concern, and this is always an easier sell.<p>The thing is that most vendors have solutions to these problems, and if Postgres doesn't have already built, you can probably build it from their primitives.  This is just my general thinking under this particular set of circumstances.",1280733260

Japan has a problem, but it is forcing confessions as the sole investigatory tactic, not corruption.  The conviction rates for any Western democracy should be ninety plus, or prosecutors are bringing cases they should know are insufficient, to the detriment of the public and innocent alike.)",1280732936
1567077,comment,1566422,1566422,0,0,edanm,,,"If you enjoyed this film and interpretation, I really recommend watching The Prestige, then reading the following:<p><i></i>SPOILER ALERT<i></i><p>The Prestige has a much better ""alternative ending"" theory, because it is not well known and very unexpected.<p>The Prestige ends with all the questions supposedly answered, i.e. the twin thing, the machine that Tesla made, etc. Except that, there is one alternative: the machine never existed! Throughout the entire film, Michael Caine's character keeps insisting that there is only one way to do a transportation act, and that is with a lookalike. We already <i>know</i> that Hugh Jackman's character has a lookalike.<p>We also never see more than one ""replica"" of Hugh Jackman. The only time we actually <i>see</i> replicas being created is during the memories written down by Hugh Jackman, except, they could be fake!<p>In short, it's possible that Christopher Nolan has managed to fool pretty much every audience of The Prestige into believing in Science Fiction, when there is a perfectly logical explanation for the entire film that doesn't require magical explanations. But like the film repeatedly says, ""Audiences want to be fooled"".",1280732849

People are complaining because the idiomatic way to explore a directory structure in Haskell <i>isn't familiar to them</i>—it's functional and mathy and strange (because exploring a directory structure in a pure-functional way <i>is</i> mathy and strange.) They want the language to be ""as easy to use"" as, say, Python, for directory-diving—but that basically means that they want to <i>do it the same way</i> they'd do it in Python. The only part that's <i>hard</i> is figuring out how to do it ""the Haskell way""—a.k.a., the unfamiliar, math-filled way.<p>What people need to learn is that you <i>don't have to do that for everything</i>. You can have all the advantages Haskell brings while not trying to make <i>everything in sight</i> into arrows and co-monoids; if it's easier to do it the non-idiomatic way (i.e. the way that doesn't involve turning your easily-expressible business domain into difficult-to-express Mathematics), then do <i>that part</i> that way, and get back to work.",1280732670

He gives speeches about damning a kid to life in prison and the moral dilemma of discretion when faced with illegal but possibly necessary civil disobedience with all the passion and articulation of a Hall of Presidents automaton.<p>It's hard for me to get the impression that his actions are anything but calculated.",1280732662

I'm still not sure if it would have ended up any differently, but it might have been technically more interesting along the way.<p>Startup 2 (Iraq): I regret not vetting employees, and on relying on dishonest/criminal people.  This killed a $50-100mm business.<p>In both cases I regret not properly separating my personal and business fiances, such that I was broke (or ~$200k in debt) after each.  I ended up having to do boring consulting for a couple years to stay above water, after each.<p>For Startup 3, I've set aside a year of personal money which I won't touch, and am only working with people I trust -- I pretty much picked this of 2-3 other opportunities based on the skills of people I know and trust.  I'm going for outside investment, even though it isn't absolutely essential, to enforce greater financial/reporting/fiduciary discipline, and to get really smart people involved -- I don't think advise from someone who won't invest is worth anywhere near as much.",1280732655

The accumulated experience doesn't imply intelligence.<p>That's not to say that I think that it's intelligence that's lacking with respect to Haskell etc. I think the problem there is the mode and style of thinking, and that most programmers are too old to easily pick up the different way of approaching problems that it becomes second nature. That, and functional programming's chosen compositional breakdown of fixed common data with an open-ended set of applicable functions is not always as applicable as object orientation's breakdown of open-ended data with inheritance of fixed sets of functions; you often need to introduce an extra level of indirection (=> abstraction) with functional programming to get access to the dynamism that OO gives you in the box.",1280732571

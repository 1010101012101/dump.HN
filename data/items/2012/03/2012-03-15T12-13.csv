Where I live (Argentina) we have a 40 hour week that usually turns at least into 45 hours because most people work from 9 to 18 with an hour for lunch in the middle.<p>Working part-time after a long time of full time work my eyes opened to the possibility of the 36-hour week. I usually discuss with a lot of people how they feel about their work schedule and what they think about working 6 hours in 6 days instead of 9 in 5, and surprisingly most defend the 40-hour week because they prefer two days of rest.

b) your web forms aren't usable
c) your website isn't helpful enough<p>And before I get flamed, I regularly sell services worth north of $2k via a web form that lets the customer purchase solely using a credit card. Instead of making it hard for people to buy and assuming that ""high touch"" means ""call us"", we have staff ready at every step of the way to help people with their purchases and the use of their services <i>when</i> they need help. Instead of investing in artificial processes that force a customer to call us, we're investing in real customer service, training and product development. Automated doesn't have to be impersonal, unless that's your frame going in. Also, I have a suspicion that real customer value can't be created in the sales process. No one has ever come out of a negotiation or sale (automated or otherwise) saying ""Now that's why I do business with these guys."". Customers derive value from <i></i>using<i></i> your product or service, not buying it. I think its misguided to try and create customer value in the sales process (Although you do say that your sales process simply explains the value to come, it doesn't try to create value... I'm just riffing on an idea... :)",1331816052

We need x in the browser, where x is every language and runtime.<p>Javascript isn't some sort of global optimum that's perfect for every possible application. The subset of Javascript that's supported by a wide range of current browsers certainly isn't. And the result is that people aiming for the web environment are limited by what Javascript can do - even though there are languages that are arguably more expressive than it.<p>The problem is right now, only browser makers get to decide what languages run in the browser. Browser makers have their own concerns, and supporting new languages hasn't been historically among them.<p>What would be nice to aim for is a model where browsers can support multiple language runtimes. Instead of the browser makers being the ones to support a language, that language's advocates would be responsible for the port - and I suspect the competition and cooperation would make them stronger.<p>Ideally, the language runtimes would be installed transparently. That's the big potential of a project like Native Client - if it lives up to its billing, it makes downloading the latest version of a language runtime to a browser safe, while giving near-native speed and abstract machine.<p>This would let Python, Ruby, Haskell, Scala, Closure, Java, non-legacy Javascript, and more exist in the same browser, giving the web platform the same diversity of languages as is available on the desktop.<p>(Mobile platforms seem to also have this problem.

There would always be at least a day of training,  and possibly some consulting services and the possibility we'd bundle in something from a vendor we work with.<p>If customers tried to set that up with a web form they'd screw it up and hate our product.<p>Similarly,  something like an ERP or Library Management System is going to take a considerable amount of attention from the vendor to fit it to your needs,  so the salesperson isn't just there to harass you,  he's there to make sure you get what you need to succeed.<p>----<p>I'm working on a product now that I could have sold through an impersonal automated process for $50 a month...  If I could get enough subscriptions.<p>I didn't believe that I could,  and decided to price the product much higher and sell it through a ""high touch"" process so I could make a living selling it to a handful of customers.<p>One issue is that anyone who sees the price would get sticker shock.  However,  the price per year will be between 1/3 and 1/4 of what it would cost to develop in house,  and it would be charitable to estimate that most organizations would have 50% chance to produce a product that works (almost) correctly...

Millions of people take drugs prescribed to them by their physicians with the implicit understanding that they are safe because the USDA says they are when in fact we have precious little idea if they really are.<p>The potential revenue from new pharmaceuticals is huge and the pressure to get new drugs out into the market is immense.  It's initially comforting to see that people are working on this problem of drug interactions since as the article mentions, we couldn't do it in the clinical trials.  Still, the cynic in me thinks this is just another step in getting everyone taking more and more prescription medicines.  If the pharmaceutical industry can show that two drugs have no interactive side effects, it's much easier to convince a patient to begin taking a new drug.  Western medicine is already heavily dependent on fixing the symptoms instead of the cause.<p>It's clear that in many cases we have almost no clue why a particular drug works.  It's thrilling to see risks removed from the system by finding drug interactions previously unknown.

It was cherry picked for a funny thought experiment where Joker is the good guy.  Now let's try the Volunteer's Dilemma.<p>In the Volunteer's Dilemma a group is faced with an inevitable negative, and the only way prevent it is for one member to assume the negative unto himself.  The classic example is jumping on the grenade.  Nobody wants to do it, but somebody has to or everyone dies.<p>1) Assume Cooperators and Defectors only.  Cooperators will eventually volunteer, Defectors never will.  There can be a balance where Cooperators significantly outnumber Defectors, but if this balance is disturbed the population will eventually end.<p>2) Add Jokers.  Jokers in this case would be like Defectors and never volunteer.  Worse, however, is that Jokers would probably be so interested in the destruction that they would actively prevent volunteering.  There can be no balance in a group with even one Joker still alive, and the population will end.<p>3) Add Batmen.  Batmen neutralize the Jokers' ability to prevent volunteers, and are willing to volunteer themselves.  The balance is restored as long as there are enough of these individuals to restore moral and put the group first.<p>So now in my thought experiment, Jokers are harbingers of the end while Batmen are necessary for survival.",1331812917

A connectivity outage wouldn't necessarily get detected within AWS, and they probably don't have good monitoring within the AWS product to detect problems like that.  The network team presumably doesn't have a good way to push status updates to the AWS dashboard automatically (and it's kind of a grey area what is a ""network outage"" -- if you lost routes to just Pakistan, that's not really a big deal for most AWS customers.  If you lose routes to everyone, yes, that's a big deal.)",1331812870

257331,comment,257019,257327,0,0,pg,,,"You're right that we wouldn't take too much more equity.  (In fact, the last time we increased the amount we invested, we didn't ask for any more equity.) But if we invested more per startup we'd tend to become more conservative.  We'd think twice about investing in some of the riskier projects, and that's the last thing we'd want.",1217039773

I would move for the winter program if I could make it work financially.  Housing a family of 5 is probably expensive in S.F.  Plus we want a good Montessori school nearby.",1217039718

First, you need to MAKE a set of applications that aren't hodge-podge; then, those apps have to be better than Apple's.

Learn about networkring, the ins and out of networking.  Where I went to school to even get into the network security course you HAD to get an associates in the general networking course.  In that case, I'd look at the Cisco networking academy.  (Http://cisco.netacad.net)<p>If it's software, the very same.  Learn about the software you want to secure FIRST.",1217038046

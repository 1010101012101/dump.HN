The Eastern Front was by far the largest, by whatever measure you care to choose: German casualties (more than half), total military casualties, total civilian casualties, materiel losses.<p>Historians are finally shedding the Hollywood propaganda and calling it ""arguably the single most decisive component of World War II, eventually serving as the main reason for Germany's defeat.""

1423346,comment,1423092,1423259,0,0,gjm11,,,"There's an interesting difference between the situations.<p>If you're a bank teller, your whole job is to manage the flow of money and information to and from customers of the bank, the ultimate goal being to make more money for the bank. If you take $3k out of the drawer, then you have failed at your immediate task (money has gone to the wrong place) and worked against the overall purpose of your job (the bank has less money, rather than more).<p>If you're a teacher, the heart of your job is (or should be) teaching your pupils: enabling them to know more and think better and so forth. A secondary purpose (the real purpose, according to some cynics) is to keep them out of their parents' hair and off the streets for a few hours every day. Another (subsidiary to the first, in an ideal world) is enabling them to do as well as possible in whatever external examinations they take, in the hope that it'll help them in later life. Arranging for your pupils' standardized test scores <i>not to be too high</i> comes very low down that list -- and if you get away with it, it benefits your pupils and your school. (While harming other pupils and other schools and other people generally, by making the test results less useful. Tragedy of the commons.)<p>That's not to say that it's not very bad for teachers to cheat to get better test results for their pupils. But it's bad in a different way from a bank teller's embezzlement: peripheral to their job rather than central, and immediately beneficial rather than harmful to the people you're supposed to be working for.<p>A better analogy (though perhaps an overdramatic one, given recent economic events) would be a mortgage salesperson, working for a mortgage broker, who sells people mortgages they are too likely to default on. When that happens, the salesperson gets more commission; his employer, the broker, gets more commission; the person who buys the mortgage gets a mortgage they want and otherwise couldn't have had (and, let's say, does manage to keep up the payments in 90% of cases, fails to do so but not so badly that they lose their home in 5% of cases, and crashes hard in 5% of cases -- which is probably kinda parallel to the outcomes for pupils whose test scores are inflated); other people, less directly connected with the broker, are the ones who get screwed.<p>Anyone expect mortgage salespeople who sell a bit too enthusiastically to get kicked out of their profession en masse? ... No, nor me.<p>> In the world we actually live in ... you'll probably not miss a day of class.<p>That doesn't appear to be what happened in the cases in the NYT article.",1276249820

To my mind, Gladwell's actions have predictable negative consequences and he should be held at least somewhat responsible for those consequences. Of course he's free to write what he likes, and I am not arguing for censorship or judicial intervention. But I think he has a negative impact on society and argue against him on that basis. He is the same as the ""visualising higher dimensions video"" or homeopathy, or any pseudo-science -- using the right words to get the answer you already thought of. I just love jerf's response to the video I mentioned (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1385736"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1385736</a>) and I'd like to misquote it here:<p>I can not anti-recommend Gladwell enough. He is anti-knowledge, convincing you that you know something when you actually understand it less well after reading than before.",1276246891

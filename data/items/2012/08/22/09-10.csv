Barker: ""Paperbacks could undermine the whole structure of publishing.""<p>That sounds very reminiscent of modern-day publisher's demands of restrictive and onerous DRM shackles for their ebooks, because DRM-free ebooks might ""undermine the whole structure of publishing.""  Sadly entrenched businesses can't always see the more-profitable future, and demand things like DRM to protect their short-term profits at the expense of consumers and culture.",1345629430

4416663,comment,4416486,4416486,6,0,carleverett,,,"I am in a very similar situation right now.  Near graduation in the spring I joined a start-up I was really excited about as a sort of unpaid intern - I basically offered to help them out free of charge.  Unlike the article though, I was not friends with the founders beforehand, I found out about them online.  I was their first ""employee"" however.  The two founders and I worked hard towards our product launch in July and it was a great success.  Everyone loved the product, and it was obvious that I was now a vital part of the company, even though my title at that point was unpaid intern.  Afterwards I brought up compensation for the first time.  Knowing they wouldn't be able to afford a salary, I pitched 2% a month of equity for a year, ending with 24%.  The problem thus far is that our product is a small airplane (<i>gasp</i> not tech!), which costs $55,000. Despite the tremendous positive feedback we've gotten on the plane, no one has pulled the trigger in the month since our launch (not a huge surprise since our financials have us starting out at 1 sale a month for our first year).  It is enough however to make the two founders wary of how much equity to give as they have absolutely no clue what the current value of the company is.<p>Our current deal is that I'm given a monthly stipend for a few months while we process some sales and get a better idea of what the company is worth, so that I can be compensated accordingly.<p>I've been wary so far of considering myself a Co-Founder, since I took no part in the original idea or the funding for the company.  From what this article is telling me though, I should absolutely be considering myself a co-founder.<p>If this is the case, how much should I push for in terms of compensation?  Is 24% a reasonable number to go after considering the facts?  I'm trying to look out for my best interests but honestly just have no idea what I'm doing.  Any advice from HN would be greatly appreciated.<p>Thanks for the article.",1345629215

His argument makes sense only for 'mandatory' context and rules, and that's a minority subset.<p>If I'm querying for the length of something, is that 18mm or 18au?  Units are mandatory context for something quantitative.  But the moment the context or rules become situational (which ends up being a large amount of the time), the problem of using objects in this space means forcing context and rules which don't apply.  And then you have something either useless or less effective.<p>The future, instead, is to model the context and rules as you do the data.  Users can then simply query how much they want/need of the former.",1345629120

The success and failure of the product somehow shifted to me, as I was the only guy actually building the product. Wouldn't have felt bad about it, if I was a co-founder. \n3. Since, the other guy is now the boss, he would come up with strategic personal inputs to magically transform the product into a unicorn, without backing it with any arguments.

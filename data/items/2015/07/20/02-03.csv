9913791,comment,9913153,9913153,0,0,brudgers,,,"My understanding of the article is that this is more about reducing duplication on breaking stories rather than preventing periodic reposting of long tail and evergreen content. That is, the proposal appears focused on the &quot;news&quot; end of the spectrum rather than the &quot;feature&quot; end.<p>It&#x27;s a reasonable request but one I tend to disagree with. Funneling all attention on one version of a breaking story reduces nuance and diversity of perspective. It also rewards fastest posting over finding the best content while taking the community out of the calculus of story value. Finally, to me the dispersion of karma awards across multiple submissions is a feature not a bug...karma should tend toward rewarding quality rather than timing where an explicit mechanism is in operation.<p>Finally, there are occasions where a story is deemed to merit the full attention of the community. The deaths of Steve Jobs and Dennis Ritchie are examples.",1437360691

9913788,comment,9913209,9913468,0,0,ogx,,,"Average house prices are going up due to Vancouver and Toronto, but house market values are set based upon a small number of sales. In other words, it&#x27;s not like 30 million houses were sold this year to establish the upward trend. It&#x27;s really a tiny fraction of them that are on the market and when it comes to VC/TO those sale prices are largely dictated by foreign investment. In VC there are entire neighbourhoods where 30% of condo units are empty all year round. The point is that the average market values going up does not represent a bubble forming that will someday cause bloodshed due to the Canadian economy going into a recession. The house prices in those areas are more detached or rather relative (i.e. when a foreigner invests in a property in Canada it&#x27;s to protect that wealth from losing value relative to other places and even when Canada is in a recession the debt burden of the country is much less than other places).<p>Poloz is not lowing the rate to help out the Canadian debtors make payments on those over inflated houses, after all unemployment is 6.8 percent and even the banks decided people didn&#x27;t need it so they only passed on a fraction of the lowering [1]. No, he&#x27;s intentionally lowing the currency value in an attempt to kickstart a new manufacturing investment wave that would normally come back to Canada given the oil prices collapse [2].<p>1. <a href=""http://t.thestar.com/#/article/business/2015/07/16/major-banks-dont-pass-on-interest-rate-cut.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://t.thestar.com/#/article/business/2015/07/16/major-ban...</a><p>2. <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_disease"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_disease</a>",1437360443

This is the only freelance client I have right now.<p>I really enjoy the work and the reason I took it was to learn a lot more about front-end development.  At the day gig, I do a lot of back-end work, along with about 15-20% client-side technologies - Silverlight (dead), WPF, and some MVC/Razor/Kendo stuff.<p>The part time gig is great.  I enjoy working with the guy who is my contact at the company and the learning experience has been great.<p>But I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m also selling my self short.  I&#x27;m only charging $65/hr.  There was a throw-away comment that the guy brought me aboard had made that leads me to believe that I could have gotten more, and the CIO has been impressed with the speed and quality of my work, so I&#x27;ve been thinking about how much I&#x27;m leaving on the table.<p>Now I live in the midwest (St. Louis) and have a very good base salary (120k/yr), and I&#x27;m doing about 40 hours on the freelance gig.  The freelance gig consists of ASP.NET MVC 5, typescript, controller code, but also more of a consulting role as in &quot;best practices&quot;, like &quot;don&#x27;t string concat a bunch of markup in the controller&quot;, and other such things.<p>In any case, we plan on buying a new house soon that might cost a pretty penny, so I&#x27;d like to bump up the rate to at least $80/hr without ill-will feelings on my part or their part if it doesn&#x27;t go through...or even them begrudgingly giving me the money but having &quot;secret hate&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s lots of work to do still and I think they have deep pockets, so I (a) would love a high-paying job with them where I could work at home, so (b) don&#x27;t want to generate ill-will, but (c) all gigs eventually come to an end so want to maximize my revenues while its hot.<p>Any advice is appreciated.",1437360229

9913776,comment,9910735,9910735,0,0,idorosen,,,"Their solution seems over-engineered for the scale of data they&#x27;re concerned with.<p>A 10 digit phone number can be encoded in 34 bits.  Supposing they used 64 bit wide fields to store the key and target data, that leaves 30 bits (more than their 2 bytes) to play with for flags or whatever target data.  To store the whole dataset in a trie or tree-like structure on disk in this model they would need 8 bytes * 400 million phone numbers < 3 terabytes of data.  So, a single 3TB or 4TB HDD ($130USD/ea) would suffice, this would give them (in the trie- or tree-like on-disk format) an access/read time in single digit or low double digit milliseconds with an HDD, or below 1 millisecond for 3 striped 1TB SSDs ($300USD/ea), for example.  The disk controller&#x27;s cache and the host&#x27;s file buffers/cache would work in their favor as well since there are probably plenty of hotspots in the data.  mmap could make the job of reading the file/disk even easier (and faster).<p>The data just isn&#x27;t that big by today&#x27;s standards.<p>Since false negatives are not possible for a properly implemented Bloom filter, using a Bloom filter in front of this on-disk approach would make it even faster for the negative case, since the disk would only be hit for positive or false positive cases, the latter of which should be relatively rare.<p>EDIT: It might be even simpler/better/faster than a trie/tree to just store the data indexed by some hash function (even just prefix bucketing) and then sequentially scan the collision list for that prefix hash for matches to the target number, which would take advantage of the much better sequential read throughput for most commodity HDDs/SSDs so that only one random read is necessary.",1437360011

Total, 10 million Windows developers. Let us say, half of all Windows use git for source control (non-git usage is still <i>huge</i> in private corporations). I am probably underestimating here. So, very roughly, that&#x27;s about 5 million git users on windows.<p>Let us also estimate that 90% of all Windows users never use a CLI. I have personally met very few Windows developers who do. Windows is very much anti-CLI. So that&#x27;s 4.5 million git users who do not use a CLI and 0.5 million Windows users who do.<p>For Mac OS X, we know that there were 1.2 million apps last year, let&#x27;s say that there are, I don&#x27;t know, three developers per app on average:<p><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/itunes-app-store-now-has-1-2-million-apps-has-seen-75-billion-downloads-to-date/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/itunes-app-store-now-has-1-...</a><p>Since Apple steers developers to use Xcode and Xcode has git integration, let&#x27;s say half of all Apple-based developers do not use the git CLI regularly. We shall assume that Apple-based developers are a bit more familiar with a CLI than Windows users. So this is 1.5 million Apple users who use git without a CLI and 1.5 million who do. That&#x27;s a total so far of 2 million CLI git users and 6.5 non-CLI git users.<p>Finally, let us say that nearly every git user has a github account. Let&#x27;s say, 25% of them don&#x27;t.

I am very confident that most git users do not use the CLI, at least not regularly. I am almost certain that of those git users who primarily use a git frontend, they only ever drop down into the command line when they need to do something very specific and they google that specific thing and copy around the magic git incantation that they find.<p>I know you can wiggle these numbers around a lot.

That doesn&#x27;t mean your data is going to automatically corrupt itself. You can just define your schema in some shared library.<p>This doesn&#x27;t work if there <i>is</i> no shared library, for example if you have two separate components in different languages both using the database. And at that point you&#x27;re (poorly) reinventing a schemaful database anyway.<p>> I can just as easily corrupt PostgreSQL if I change data types without updating the ORM.<p>A good ORM will abide by your database schema - and no, you can&#x27;t &quot;corrupt PostgreSQl&quot; by &quot;not updating your ORM&quot;. It will, at most, error out because you&#x27;re trying to work with non-existent columns.<p>In a schemaless database, there&#x27;s no such thing as &quot;non-existent columns&quot;, thus you can quietly corrupt data without realizing it.",1437359478

The academic view seems that things weren&#x27;t that awful until 1931, when a large Austrian bank failed (Google Creditanstalt), which triggered a wave of global bank failures [1]. The resulting lack of credit was the cause that made the depression Great. When Creditanstalt went down, Dow was off ~50% from its 1929 high, which still happens every now and then. We went through a similar decline during the 2007-08 financial crisis and came out all right thanks to aggressive and globally organized central bank activity. Unfortunately such an organized response didn&#x27;t happen in the 1930s so the economies kept contracting, and the Dow eventually ended up losing 90%. Check out the charts in that period, it is fascinating.<p>[1] <a href=""https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/meltzer/bermac95.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/meltzer/bermac95.pdf</a>",1437358673

Same as any marketing/advertising company.<p>""How often should they pay out the merchants?""<p>As slowly as possible, from Groupon's perspective.  What was so amazing here was they essentially built an ad network where the inventory suppliers had zero power over the scenario and accepted unfavorable payment terms.

One of the smartest was realizing that though their model was no different from any other sort of ad network, since it wasn't immediately obvious to outsiders, and since their suppliers had so little power, they could make up new accounting rules and principles to generate favorable cash flows.<p>I don't write this to say this was wrong. It was brilliant.  I want to disagree with the idea that they HAD to do this.  They could have paid out net 30 and counted refunds like any other business, but they realized they could get away with not doing this for some time, and ran with it.",1362120332
5303161,comment,5302157,5302397,1,0,dietrichepp,,,"1. Compare programming to home DIY.  Sure, every year you'll have people who knock down load-bearing walls, get pesticide backwash into the drinking water, or turn a simple de-icing operation into a raging inferno.  But people also assemble millions of shelves and beds, unclog millions of drains, and build thousands of greenhouses and planter boxes.<p>2. Professional programmers create awful messes too.  They do it less often, but with greater consequences.  Just like the contractors building a bridge are less likely to screw up than some goofball installing a new water heater at home, but a bad bridge is much more dangerous.  Give people more training when the potential consequences of bad work are more severe, and less training when it's just not needed.<p>3. The value of someone with both domain knowledge and programming knowledge is usually immense.  You can either teach a programmer about the domain, or you can teach a domain expert how to program.  If you have a programmer with a bit of domain knowledge, then they know what kind of questions to ask the domain experts.  If you have a domain expert with a bit of programming knowledge, then they know how to communicate technical requirements to a professional programmer.<p>Let's take your analogy with the publishing house.

A person that runs a cleaning service with 5 or 6 employees gets all of that.<p>The question then may not be so much about having something to be totally in love with. We all have to be practical. As long as you like what you are doing and you are in a position that gives you that control from doing it, that might be enough. I can't say that I'm totally passionate about what I do, but I gave up on finding my ""passion"". I have marketable skills and I am leveraging it. I was a full time employee of a Fortune 500 software company and then I became a full time contractor. I am loving that aspect of it. I am more in control of my work, I don't fully control my time but if I don't put in a 7.5 hour day or take a day off here or there, no one is on my back. Personally for me the next logical step is to build a business so that I am able to get even more in control (ie move away from having my income depending on hours).<p>So, what can you do now that can bring you closer to giving you that control? If you are full time, can you go contract? I'm not talking freelancing but instead doing the full 40 hour week but getting paid hourly. If you are already doing that, then the next step is to just save and save money. The way older people can somewhat make up for the advantages of youth is to have a large runway. Having $100K to $200K that you can live on and spend on your business for the next two-three years goes a long way to having a better chance of success. Having a wife and kids and putting the house on the line and worrying about the next mortgage payment or rent payment isn't being an entrepreneur, that is just being plain stupid and selfish.<p>If you hang around your local startup groups, you will realize that everybody has something to bring to the table no matter how old.<p>Anyway, I get your frustration. I would not devalue yourself. Don't take any of this seriously. It's just not worth it. One book that I think you would find worth reading is Cal NewPort's book - So Good They Can't Ignore You. His blog is also interesting.<p>Thanks for letting me share my opinion on this. I don't intend it to sound preachy - it is just my own thoughts.",1362120281

These are represented by abstractions in a program in order to facilitate expressing the ideas in a way that is more related to the domain.'<p>Overall, I like to draw a line between canonical/ontological representations of models and representations of models designed for calculation. The ontological representation often times exists in a relational database or in an explicit OWL/RDF ontology, but may also exist only ideally, where the storage and calculation representations of the model are each customized for their particular use, especially at large scale.<p>the following concept, I almost agree with...<p>'it is our job to express the abstractions of the domain for the best economy of the expression'<p>As programmers (vs ontologists) I would say that our job is first to express the abstractions such that they enable efficient, maintainable computation that hopefully is expressing those abstractions economically.

Her premise was: how would an industrialised, polytheistic society cope with monotheistic terrorism?<p>It's an alternate history; the point of departure being that Archimedes of Syracuse was captured, taken to Rome and then  funded (because the Romans were nothing if not practical). In her setting, the Romans are well into an industrial revolution.<p>The blurb she wrote for an agent:<p><pre><code>    Pontius Pilate is a successful corporate lawyer \n    headhunted by the Roman Senate to run a difficult \n    province in need of a gentler, civilian touch. Hes \n    been in the job five years  and is starting to get \n    the hang of it  when the Yeshua Ben Yusuf file \n    lands on his desk. This is not ideal right now. \n    Judaea is in the midst of a major terrorism crisis, \n    his wife keeps threatening to go back to Caesarea (\n    she cant stand Jerusalem), his son is becoming far \n    too friendly with the High Priests son, and his \n    boss keeps forgetting that he isnt actually in the \n    army. Even worse, his closest friend and greatest \n    rival from law school is Ben Yusufs lawyer. A \n    Jerusalem courtroom is the setting for the first \n    clash of civilisations, where people from a \n    fundamentally different tradition are forced to \n    engage with religious ideas that in many respects \n    they do not want to understand.\n\n    What is most distinctive about the book is my \n    imagining of what a technologically advanced pagan \n    civilisation would look like. That is, what if the \n    Romans won much of their empire under conditions \n    that we associate with the Industrial Revolution? \n    What if  with their distinctive, non-Christian \n    moral values  they were gifted with all that \n    immense fire-power and confronted with monotheistic \n    terrorists?\n    \n    I do not think the Romans were secular in the \n    modern sense, and I havent portrayed them as such. \n    They were, however, very different from the \n    monotheistic peoples they confronted in Judaea. My \n    Roman characters are still religious, but \n    differently religious. Unlike many authors of a \n    skeptical bent, I do not seek to score cheap shots \n    by denigrating religion per se. Rather, Bring Laws \n    & Gods recognises the persistent vitality of \n    religious traditions, especially when their \n    practitioners are confronted with overwhelming \n    military power and physical occupation by non-\n    believers.\n</code></pre>\nIt should be published this year and I am very much looking forward to reading it, based on the introduction and samples she's dropped:<p><a href=""http://skepticlawyer.com.au/2010/09/22/the-past-is-a-foreign-country/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skepticlawyer.com.au/2010/09/22/the-past-is-a-foreign...</a><p><a href=""http://skepticlawyer.com.au/2010/09/24/the-angel-bring-laws-and-gods-outtake-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skepticlawyer.com.au/2010/09/24/the-angel-bring-laws-...</a> (NSFW)<p><a href=""http://skepticlawyer.com.au/2010/10/15/the-visit-bring-laws-and-gods-outtake-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skepticlawyer.com.au/2010/10/15/the-visit-bring-laws-...</a><p><a href=""http://skepticlawyer.com.au/2010/11/25/patria-patria/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skepticlawyer.com.au/2010/11/25/patria-patria/</a> (NSFW)",1362119240

Them's the rules of the game, for any leadership role. He is saying no more than that.<p>In particular, he never says he was wrong.

5303070,comment,5302940,5302940,8,0,pjreddie,,,"At my last job I worked at a YC startup where the entire codebase was written in the 3 months leading up to demo day when the team was under a lot of time pressure. Sure it worked fine as a demo, but with the pace of startup land this same code was then thrown into production and as the startup grew the codebase couldn't quite keep up. There weren't many catastrophic failures but there ended up being a lot of patching that had to happen on a daily basis. I would say 80% of my time was spent tracking down weird bugs in the code and trying to figure out what the hell the original authors were thinking when they designed things so poorly.<p>The point is, you probably will write really bad code if you are under a lot of time pressure. Hackathons seem like they are probably useful for some things like bouncing around ideas and quickly fleshing stuff out but please, for the love of god, if you decide to take your hackathon idea and run with it DELETE ALL OF YOUR CODE. Just do it. Then take some time and think through your overall design because trying to make major modifications when there are paying customers relying on your site every day really sucks.",1362117999

The questions that I think doomed me were questions about HTTP status codes and CSRF/XSS attacks.<p>The HTTP status code thing went something like ""Why don't you name off some HTTP status codes?"" So I rattled off the ones I knew off the top of my head, but then he asked me for more. It's the kind of question you can look up in about 30 seconds if you need to, but in an interview setting it's difficult to recall the ones you don't see often.<p>The manager guy also asked me to describe CSRF and XSS and the details of how those exploits work. I knew what they were, but I hadn't actually examined or written one before. I did learn about them inside and out when I completed the latest Stripe CTF though. I thought that question was reasonable, and I just didn't know it.<p>There were also some questions about caching in high-traffic environments, which I didn't know much about but I knew enough about it to tell them that I would be able to pick it up quickly. I don't think they liked when I admitted not knowing something though. It also seemed kind of interesting that there was so much emphasis on it since I wasn't interviewing to work with the main developer team but with one of their splinter offices who builds proofs of concept and prototypes.<p>I did pretty well on the rest of it, including the 2nd part of the interview with one of their in-house tool developers. There was supposed to be a third part where I would have interviewed with a non-developer to assess culture fit, but they ended my interview before that part.<p>I think I probably bombed it because I've been consulting for a long time and have a different development approach than they were looking for.",1362117737

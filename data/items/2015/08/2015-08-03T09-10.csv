Compete in such a way that they can&#x27;t effectively fight back. For example pick off one (or a few) of their products and differentiate like crazy. Apple got stuck in a situation where they neede their own maps service.

The fact that both &quot;style as a table&quot; and &quot;center&quot; attain to the visual aspect doesn&#x27;t change the fact there is a semantic difference between the two.<p>Also, if divs have no semantic meaning in the context of the document&#x27;s structure, it means they serve some other purpose: and that purpose is visual styling (not directly but through a css applied to them).

Certainly recursion was difficult for me when I was first learning because I had done a lot of programming using iteration first.  It seems surprising that it may have just been a bias of what was introduced first.<p>I think that eigenclasses are a good example of this.  Just because of the languages I learned early on, eigenclasses were obvious to me.

It returns an object, which is a function of one argument, where the argument is equivalent to the name of a method. In this case, the methods are getters, so they evaluate to values. You could just as easily have stored more procedures in the object returned by the constructor.<p>In this case, numbers where chosen as method names and sugary procedures defined outside the object itself. You could have used symbols:<p><pre><code>    (define (cons x y)
      (lambda (method)
        (cond ((eq? method &#x27;car) x)

9994594,comment,9990484,9992431,0,0,david927,,,"Thanks for writing that, Dan.  It&#x27;s important to clarify what we&#x27;re arguing about.<p><i>Underneath &quot;others are stupid&quot; lies &quot;my intelligence goes unrecognized&quot;</i><p>Oh, but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s good to check where this is coming from: It is <i>precisely</i> because I know what brilliant minds we have in this industry that I am disappointed.  I am blown away by how much smarter others in this industry are than I am -- and that is one of the reasons it stings.  Imagine you have a nephew who you know to be a prodigy and, sure enough, he ends up getting his PhD at MIT, and you&#x27;re so proud of him.  Then he tells you his dissertation is called &#x27;Yo&#x27; and is 200 pages about sending &#x27;Yo&#x27; to your friends, and how he expects will make him <i>rich, rich, rich</i>!<p>The disappointment <i>stems</i> from the expectation that he can do better.<p><i>underneath &quot;others are undeservedly rich&quot; lies &quot;I deserve better&quot;; and so on.</i><p>That&#x27;s a very strange motivation to project on this situation that we&#x27;re funding foolish endeavours and not funding truly interesting research.
[By the way, projecting jealousy is one of the last tools of defence in the box and one of the lowest.  It&#x27;s easy to use, hard to refute and is rarely germane. Please be careful.]<p>My comments were made because <i>our industry is a ship driven by greed to foolish ends</i>.  We are abundant in potential but are squandering it like spoiled grandchildren.  Joe Armstrong opened last year&#x27;s StrangeLoop with &quot;We can do better.&quot;  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve heard Alan Kay&#x27;s talks since, what, 1997?  He&#x27;s... jealous?  I don&#x27;t think so.  He, like many of us, would just like to see progress.  But we&#x27;ve made little-to-no progress in the last 35 years.<p>So when we also see what projects are funded, it&#x27;s not hard to frustrated.  Can you imagine a time when chemistry is exploding and yet it&#x27;s hard to get funding to do medical research but there is funding, plenty of it, if you want to create better fireworks?  Go to a top conference on the most innovative projects and there&#x27;s not an investor to be found, but stand near someone who just made Angry Birds and you might get a concussion from the stampede.<p>A much lighter way of hearing what I&#x27;m trying to say is this: try to find a TV show called &quot;That Mitchell and Webb Look&quot;, Episode 4.1, wherein a chemist who thinks he finds a cure for a disease is told by the owner, M. Ganier, that this is <i>his</i> laboratoire and he demands new ways to make hair silky!  I think you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s hysterical and at the same time -- this is how many of us feel.<p>You&#x27;re right that you hear emotion, but it&#x27;s frustration, because it&#x27;s not that we can&#x27;t, it&#x27;s that we don&#x27;t.",1438593173

Far out the most flexible way of dealing with the multitude of complex entities in a game is to not work with inheritance but rather with &#x27;components&#x27;. Ideally this means that an entity is nothing more than a UUID for which data is stored in component tables (a la relational databases).<p>Unfortunately that approach is rather cumbersome to reason about and brings with it unhandy syntax requisites. Given an entity UUID, how do you get a value for some property? It would be component_table_get(health_components, entity_id)->hitpoints. Or something similar. (note: what happens if you accidentily call that function on a entity_id for which no health_components entry exists?)<p>The alternative which is really fine for smaller games and which often leaks into the codebase of larger games, sometimes for performance reasons is to make the entity a struct which has some members common to all entities. Now you can do entity->hitpoints, but the downside is that every entity, including abstract game components such as the camera also have hitpoints.<p>If you&#x27;re curious why games don&#x27;t do inheritance (anymore) look up articles about Component Entity Systems, they usually do a good idea of explaining why games are too complex for inheritance.",1438593005

For reference, I was working for one of those companies I listed above, and I put in less than 30 hours in a typical week, and still got heaps of praise for how quickly I got things done (in calendar time). I kept asking for <i>more</i> to do, but never really got enough to keep me busy full time. Ultimately I ended up helping with related projects, or company-wide tooling, just because I enjoyed helping and had the time.<p>I didn&#x27;t feel the need to <i>prove</i> anything, exactly, but sometimes things would go south and I&#x27;d put in more hours because <i>I</i> felt like something should have taken less time, yes. That&#x27;s not &quot;prove to me you&#x27;re 10x!&quot;, but my work ethic coming out and keeping me on task until my expected workload was actually complete.<p>But <i>even then</i> I don&#x27;t think I went beyond 45 hours in a week in my time there as an employee. And I didn&#x27;t work on a weekend even once. If something really hadn&#x27;t gotten done in what I felt like was a reasonable work week, I would have let it slide. That may have happened once, but only once. Making the proprietary company build system do things it wasn&#x27;t precisely designed to do ... well, I just can&#x27;t talk about it, since I don&#x27;t swear in public posts. ;)",1438592784

Remember the Google/Apple maps split.<p>Autonomous vehicles rely on extremely good mapping, and if the car companies don&#x27;t own their own stack they are in danger of becoming mere OEMs, producing commodity hardware for someone else who extracts the value from the system.

9994546,comment,9994276,9994519,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I expected that to be the case but repeated measurements tell me that it is in fact the opposite. The difference was about 50% faster on the version with everything inlined. Counter-intuitive for sure!<p>For instance, just taking the CSS out and loading that separately doubled the page rendering time (because another resource had to be loaded <i>after</i> the first one).<p>Now it is just like a &#x27;declare before use&#x27; program in a regular programming language, by the time the browser reaches a tag that needs definitions from the CSS the CSS is already there, right there in the page, no need to wait until reading that separate resource is done. And that round-trip to the server is actually more expensive than the entire embedded CSS. Looking at it after going through the whole exercise it makes sense but that was definitely not what I expected. Even more counter-intuitive: this holds even when loading multiple pages on the same site that share the same (small) CSS file.<p>So in the end the inlining of the CSS was a good thing to test. Presumably, there is some cross over point where if the CSS file gets very large there is a benefit for follow-up pages on the same site to be able to re-use it.",1438592423

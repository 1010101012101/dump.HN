As an example, an employee in Florida gets $140k which is only $30k less than we&#x27;d pay him if he were local.<p>> But that is still an concern since your salary gets reset if you ever change companies without moving back to silicon valley.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this is true. If you&#x27;re going to work for another SV company and remote, it&#x27;s quite common for you to be able to quote a number higher than you got from your previous remote job and negotiate your way down to at or just above where you actually were in the previous job. The only time where I&#x27;d see you needing to adjust your salary down is if you took a job with a non-SV company in the interim. Just be aware that the salary data used by each company may be different.<p>But it is probably helpful to come to SV/SF at some point in the beginning and transition to remote work initially because hiring out here is somewhat incestuous and having a well-known SV employer on your CV will help with getting past HR filters and ensure you get the necessary LI touches.",1451669584

I know that M$ has a pile of hacks going on there, but hey, it works.<p>OTOH, all Java IDEs I&#x27;ve used so far lag by default. It&#x27;s often about the little things - like those 1 second delays in menus, or 100ms delays between keystroke and letter appearing on screen, etc. Enough to make the experience frustrating. If I keep using them it&#x27;s only because some advanced features don&#x27;t have an equivalent (or easily installable equivalent) in Emacs. But it&#x27;s a tradeoff between having a powerfool tool that I use every once in a while vs. enduring the constant experience of bloat.<p>Features of IDEs are cool, but they seriously need to optimize them.

One of the father&#x27;s of one of the guys  wanted to help out his kid and set them up in an office and set up the corporation.  These guy put out sone good games, and loved their jobs.  Along with not wearing ties, free food and \nsodas.  They loved going to work.  That was until EA bought \nthe company, and shut them down.  I think they each got 500k?\nI used to wonder why he didn&#x27;t include me(we were all lost in the career market) in the company?  He knew I was floundering, but I don&#x27;t hold it against him--I really didn&#x27;t \nlike playing games.  I still wonder why he didn&#x27;t include me though.  I included him in every money making thing I was in?  Anyways, it&#x27;s history, but don&#x27;t overlook your true friends \nwhen starting a company--especially if they were always taking money/drinks/etc. from you?  It hurts!",1421182797

8882532,comment,8881811,8881811,0,0,dougmccune,,,"I have a similar story in some ways. Employee #1 at a startup, wrote much of the initial codebase, been with the company now for a bit over 7 years. We’re 20 people now, and have dedicated people for support, UX, QA, product management, etc etc all of which I used to have a hand in in the early days. I manage a small team of developers (not all the dev, just the clientside team), I still code a good bit (obviously less than before) and I’m involved in a lot of product discussions to figure out what we’re going to build. We’ve struggled a lot with figuring out the right title for me, and as long as the actual work is the right mix for what I like then I don’t really care all that much. But I’ve been recently brainstorming appropriate titles that better reflect what I do, beyond just being a developer (which has been my title since day 1), and I’ve come to settle on “Technical Director of Product”, which I don’t think is a real job title in any normal world. I make sure that I’m heavily involved in product decisions, because the thing I’ve found the most satisfaction in is defining and building product, and shaping the direction of the company through influencing the product development path. And I’m grounded in the technical side of that, which is an important distinction to me, since too often “product people” have no technical background and just lob things over the fence to engineering without understanding the tech side of the house.<p>So for me the important thing was trying to understand what parts of the job I really want to prioritize (in my case active coding and product definition) and regardless of title making sure I inject myself appropriately. So that means if there’s a conversation about a new product we’re thinking about building I make sure I’m in those conversations from the beginning.<p>If you’ve been with the company from essentially day 1 you likely have a decent amount of political sway, even if you don’t know it. I’d start by figuring out which parts of the things that you listed you actually want to stay involved in. As another commenter mentioned, if you really want to wear all those hats then maybe finding another brand new startup is the only real choice. But if there’s one or two areas that are dearer to your heart then I’d try to figure out how to make that your day to day activity. And I’d hope given your history with the team that you can have a dialogue with the founder(s) about how to make that happen. At the end of the day the title doesn’t really mean shit, but if you’re not loving the work then you owe it to yourself (and they owe it to you) to figure out how to make that right.",1421182592

It would take quite a literary gymnast to get violence out of commands such as, &quot;Do not injure, abuse, oppress, enslave, insult, torment, torture, or kill any creature or living being.&quot;[1] Jain protests can involve fasting[2], but never violence. Other forms of Buddhism (such as Zen) can be violent, but compassion is at the core of Theravāda.

All GoPro did was package up the generic product from China, increased the price by 100%, and then used all the extra revenue to buy a ton of adverts.<p>People often like to claim that GoPro won because it was optically better, but that just isn&#x27;t accurate.

8882476,comment,8881811,8881811,0,0,abannin,,,"There are tough questions to ask yourself, and I applaud your introspection. One of the challenges of a rapidly growing company is keeping up with it. Hiring is about finding the right person for the right time. When a company changes drastically through growth, expectations and functions change. The person who did x may be unqualified to do y. In short, the company grows faster than the individual. Another dynamic is that as the organization grows, the need for generalists gives way to specialized employees.<p>I think this is a very powerful statement you made: &quot;all the tasks I did were less challenging than some critical parts of the code base I wrote from scratch&quot;. This tells me that the problems that interest you the most are coding and architecture problems, and that you are happiest when solving those problems. Employees will have the greatest positive impact when they are focused on tasks that they enjoy. But it seems that you desire something more. What is dissatisfying about the current situation? Are you bored with the coding? Are you jealous of others getting recognition? Are you frustrated with the direction of the organization? Are you frustrated that you are no longer &quot;that guy&quot; whom everyone depends on? All of these circle around the same question: where do you want to be?<p>Leadership comes in many shapes and sizes. It&#x27;s not just about how many direct reports you have. Fundamentally, great leaders shape the direction of an organization. Employees look to that person for advice, encouragement, and approval. It sounds like the company decided to hire others for formal leadership roles. A very difficult and powerful question is to ask yourself &quot;what is the VP doing that I wasn&#x27;t able to do?&quot; There is a tactical reason that the CEO hired the VP, and it isn&#x27;t because of credentials. Perhaps it&#x27;s his/her ability to communicate across teams, or gain the confidence of management? Don&#x27;t let your ego tell you &quot;nothing, I&#x27;m better than them&quot;; there is a reason they are VP. Different jobs require different skill sets, and understanding where you are strong and weak is critical your success. Being an engineer who kicks out mission critical code is fundamental to the success of the business, but it is extremely different than developing and managing a team. With a humble attitude that is always looking to improve, there is no stopping your career growth.",1421181937

8882434,comment,8873834,8881839,0,0,greggyb,,,"First, I&#x27;m going to use the term &quot;taxi service&quot; below and I&#x27;d like to clarify that I mean this in a very general sense - paid transportation in vehicle classes that would normally be used for private transport, whether provided by a firm or individual, and facilitated by any means. I don&#x27;t think we disagree based on the tone of your post, but this is for other potential readers. Please let me know if you do disagree.<p>In this case taxi service need not be supplied by full-time taxi drivers, which is a central point to most of my thinking on this matter. Taxi service can be provided in any quantity (subject to the limits of time and space, obviously) by any individual with a car. A person may provide taxi service once in their life or dozens of times a day.<p>Second, I will refer to Uber below for simplicity, but I intend my argument to apply to all similar services that exist (Lyft so far as I know) and may come into existence as competitors.<p>In the status quo the number of medallions is a rough approximation of the limit of taxi services. I think we can agree that the current number of medallions currently limits the supply of taxi services (the supply curve is shifting toward the origin because cost of entry is higher than in the complete absence of medallions or equivalents), and therefore raises the equilibrium price of taxi services. Currently the medallion represents an economic rent (regardless of who owns the medallion a rent is being collected).<p>In the future state (this is a very general future state - anything where the current limit imposed by medallions is weakened or removed entirely and at least some of the rent that exists in the status quo is transformed into revenue for Uber) the situation is improved. The revenue collected by Uber is not an economic rent, but rather a transactional cost.<p>First, the cost structure is different - a transactional cost is marginal, whereas the medallion rent (this is specific to a medallion, not all economic rents in general) is either not marginal or marginal at a much coarser granularity. If I rent a medallion on a monthly basis, then I am deciding whether it is worth it to me to drive a taxi for another month. With a transactional cost, I decide whether it is worth it to me to provide one more trip of taxi service. This allows someone who might just pick up people on their normal commute (this is just an example that I find easy to discuss, not the entire basis of my argument) to provide taxi service. Right here we see an increase in supply of taxi services. Our first order analysis should lead us to expect that this increased supply should lead to downward pressure on the cost of taxi service.<p>Second, the transactional cost is incurred by a competitive firm (currently one competitor in Lyft (that I know of), but even nonexistent competitors can provide pressure[0]). If a competitor can provide a similar service to Uber (matching willing drivers to willing passengers) at a lower cost, then the transactional cost will be driven downward and since there is clear competition in this case among drivers, the cost to end users will ultimately be driven down[1]. In this case, even if we accept your equivalence of Uber&#x27;s profits and the current economic rent of medallions (note: I do not accept this equivalence, which I think the rest of my post makes clear) the $/ride of this money will decrease, resulting in a net gain.<p>I have not yet addressed your points about insurance, but first I would like to conclude my current line of reasoning by addressing your fourth paragraph.<p>You discuss driver incomes and wages, with a comparison to minimum wage. I do not believe the connotation of these terms is in alignment with what is made possible by the service Uber offers in matching casual drivers with occupants. I believe the innovation of Uber is just a re-realization (with some obvious improvements) of the jitney service of the early 1900s. I discuss this concept in more detail in another post[2] with a link to a very interesting history of the trend[3]. In brief summary, ride-sharing is a distributed casual endeavor. A useful metaphor may be Folding@Home - a service that utilizes excess capacity of capital with a significant sunk cost component. I do not think it is accurate to talk about someone&#x27;s income or wage for something that is not their job. It is not strictly false to do so, since the terms are technically general, but they carry the connotation of employment and I do not think we face a model of employment. We don&#x27;t talk about someone&#x27;s wage when they host AirBnB guests. We do not talk about the average person&#x27;s Craigslist furniture income. My position is that we should view ride-share as analogous to these two examples, rather than as analogous to the current status quo of taxi driver as occupation.<p>Finally, with regards to insurance, Uber provides insurance to its drivers which is primary to their personal auto insurance[4]. I do not believe your statements regarding insurance are factual or I am misunderstanding your reasoning. I would also like to understand why you expect accident rates and insurance claims to increase. I can think of numerous lines of reasoning, but I&#x27;d like to understand yours.<p>[0] Pressure from potential entrants can force a firm to act as if it had competitors. This idea is not strictly necessary for my argument, so I have removed its exposition. Even if you do not accept this line of reasoning my argument stands since there is no clear monopoly in providing services similar to Uber. So long as a competitor may enter a market, an incumbent firm faces competitive pressure. To wit, if Uber were the only firm in the market, there is currently no large barrier preventing a competitor from creating a similar service and offering a lower price. (There are costs to entry which provide some barrier, but cost of entry does not prevent all competition - there is a nuance that I&#x27;ll not delve into here about capturing monopoly rents in proportion to the natural cost of entry to the market - it alters but does not destroy the line of reasoning presented.) If Uber wishes to maintain its singular position in market, it cannot sustain monopoly pricing. To do so, it would have to restrict its own supply to raise prices. Since prices would be above equilibrium, competitors would have incentive to enter the market an collect a portion of that monopoly rent. Upon entry of a competitor, we naturally see competitive behavior. If Uber wishes to maintain its singular market position, it must act as if it has competitors, else it will gain competitors. This process would keep prices in line. Monopoly rents are only regularly collected by regulated industries. We could argue causality there, but that is a different conversation and this post is plenty long.<p>[1] I suggest that competition among drivers would lower the price to consumers. This is not exactly true, since as we both know Uber sets the price, collects the payment, and pays the driver. What I actually mean is that since in the future state there is no artificial limit on the number of drivers, the natural consequence is for price to consumers to fall. Uber wants more customers, so they will lower the cost to their customers. There is an equilibrium to be found among driver remuneration and customer cost. I think we both agree that the trend would be downward for driver pay.<p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8875663"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8875663</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/discover/724795?sid=21105612783593&uid=3739256&uid=2488599363&uid=3&uid=70&uid=60&uid=2134&uid=3739664&uid=2&uid=2488599353"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/discover/724795?sid=21105612783593&uid=...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://blog.uber.com/ridesharinginsurance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.uber.com/ridesharinginsurance</a>",1421181480

You want about 2 or so PSI (varies by system) to keep water out and eliminate all chance of corrosion.  The density of liq N2 is such that a small liq tank is the equivalent of a staggeringly large gas N2 pressurization system like the size of a tank car.  Also its very hard to explode a liq tank and very easy to explode an ultra high pressure tank by making a mistake with regulators and pipes.  A dewar would keep a feedline pressurized for, eh, maybe week, maybe weeks.  Some dewars have a better or worse vacuum than others.  Boys will be boys and we screwed around with the liq N2 a little.  The author got ripped off because in bulk we paid roughly &quot;milk&quot; prices.  Supposedly the liq N2 and milk price comparison held for decades at a time in the old days.  So his little 20 liter dewar should have cost maybe $20 to fill.  Then again, higher energy costs than the 90s, liability insurance, and &quot;we know foodies will pay anything, so lets charge them anything...&quot;<p>Anyway.

If you think about it, flooding something with N2 specifically to prevent chemical reactions means its not fit for sale unless its ridiculously pure.  So it is.<p>Another chemistry problem is you&#x27;re looking for something that could end up in the product stream without being filtered out or destroyed by the process gear (or destroying the process gear), so kryptonite is kinda unlikely.  Also it has to be liq at liq n2 temps because a gas would blow away and a solid (dirty ice, lets say) would remain stuck to the container.  Good luck finding a substance like that.

8882393,comment,8879927,8879927,0,0,NateG,,,"What is true is if you chased the mobile game craze there was a small window where little indie games had traction.  A well developed indie game (I would call it an exception at this point) can still gain traction in today&#x27;s app stores but it is rare.  It is true that with the increased supply of games three things have happened.  First, the amount of terrible games one must slog through to find a gem has increased.  Second the number of gems has also increased which in turn keeps raising the bar of what a &quot;gem&quot; is.  Third a race to the bottom began and player&#x27;s expectations changed and what they are willing to pay with it.  The real culprit and difference than the days or yore or even just five years ago is exposure and marketing costs.<p>I run a small indie studio and our game Pit of War[1] is a <i>very</i> niche game (a PvP, character building, gladiatorial strategy game with text and still images.  You don&#x27;t get much more niche than that!) and we&#x27;ve found great success by managing our resources well and not chasing the latest craze be it flash, facebook, mobile, or what have you.  We chose to keep the game on the web and keep full control over it instead of having to pass a judgment committee, or handing over 30% of our revenue to some platform.  I found a niche that I enjoyed and had little competition and then built a game and a community around it.  That last part is critical these days.  I&#x27;m sure many of you have heard about &quot;A 1000 true fans&quot;[2], and it very much applies here.  If you are using a F2P business model it is your bread and butter.<p>In 2010-2012 everything was awesome and then something happened in late 2012, early 2013.  The user acquisition costs skyrocketed.  In the last five years I&#x27;ve seen CPA costs increase 300%-600%.  I spent time in Japan and knew some people at an ad agency there that mainly caters to mobile game companies and the CPA on those networks was averaging 700-800 yen (about $7-$8), with peak prices hitting 5,000 yen ($50) when Japanese companies paid out the yearly bonuses to their employees.  Five years earlier CPAs were around $1.50 and less.  The price increases on their networks have mainly been fueled by four or five companies like Supercell, GREE, DeNA etc.  This is where the fairytale ended for a lot of indies and small studios hoping to make a living.  It is a rare game that can pay those kinds of marketing costs and remain profitable.<p>My recommendation to anyone looking to get into indie game development would be to find a niche you enjoy and be the best in it.  Build a community around it.  Learn how to utilize an ethical F2P business model and last but certainly not least, have fun.<p>[1] If you are curious about what can be accomplished with a web based niche game you can check it out here: <a href=""http://www.pitofwar.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pitofwar.com</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://kk.org/thetechnium/2008/03/1000-true-fans/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kk.org/thetechnium/2008/03/1000-true-fans/</a>",1421181059

8882377,comment,8879927,8879927,0,0,zackmorris,,,"I dabbled in shareware games for roughly 20 years.  I had high hopes for making a revolutionary game and my ship coming in like Notch, but what I found was that making a game was never the difficult part.  It was always about funding - making rent each month, affording food, etc.  It was also about telling people no, because the closest people around me were often the most demanding of my time and energy, even going as far as telling me what I should be working on.  I failed utterly on both fronts.<p>I found (and still find) most games deeply underwhelming, especially when they get high praise for their creative gameplay or plot, because those are the easy parts.  Very few games also have solid engineering like Minecraft.  That solid engineering is so elusive, so expensive, that it’s effectively out of reach on an indie budget.  The only thing left is cookie cutter games like Angry Birds, which I categorize as the first thing that would come out of any medium.  So if all you have is eggs you make an omelet, if all you have is leaves you rake them, if all you have is a physics engine you throw things.  It’s no wonder that the profit for something anyone can make either rapidly approaches zero or goes into the stratosphere on its own fame like Paris Hilton, creating the illusion of value for an industry that would otherwise have none.<p>Then I watched a talk by (as I recall) Jason Fried of 37 Signals, who made the rather astounding point that the way to earn a profit is to make something people want and sell it for money.  This was after the dot bomb when people were still chasing eyeballs, I wish I could find the video.  It was one of the prime motivators that got me to quit my soul-sucking job and flip broken computers for a year, and then get into contracting.  It finally hit me that people make money doing all kinds of things because people want them, and I didn’t have to suffer the grind in my life any longer, because to work so hard at something people aren’t willing to pay for is the very definition of futile.<p>Sooo.. I may make another game.  I may sell it at the exorbitant price of $5, $10 even $20.  I may not even give away a free demo.  All of the other free, ad-based, casual, social games of the world can keep playing house, and bless them for doing so.  But people will always want the real games, and I know that because I would be willing to pay for one, should one come along.  I’m thinking that in this case, if Apple and other companies have really created a race to the bottom economy for games and other apps, then nature will “find a way” and create more of an egalitarian way for developers to earn an income, perhaps from crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter, but more likely from guilds, co-ops and to be quite frank a collective approach that takes the enormous wealth produced by the industry and uses it for something more productive than the hypervaluation of startups.  As far as I can tell, we’re on the verge of total blah just like in 2000 and if everyone doesn’t wake up, history is about to repeat itself.  If we glorify success and ignore wasted potential, the next thing we sell that people are willing to pay for could very well be a side of fries.",1421180950

8882353,comment,8881760,8882059,0,0,exelius,,,"> The author seems to have made up his mind already. The reason banks don&#x27;t allow marijuana companies to setup accounts is regulatory and risk management related, not ethical.<p>I seem to keep having to say this, but I&#x27;ll do it again: companies are not bound by ethics or morality. Applying them to a company is inherently wrong because companies cannot have any goal other than shareholder value maximization long-term. Here&#x27;s why:<p>1. Companies are not people, despite what the Supreme Court may say. They are legal constructs built around a set of rules.<p>2. Everyone who could potentially represent a company - a board member, an executive - plays a role and can be replaced at any time should they fail to perform their role adequately.<p>3. Executives are appointed by the board with one responsibility: to maximize the value of the company. This is the extent of a company&#x27;s moral obligation: companies have a moral obligation to their shareholders to make money (or at least try in good faith to do so).<p>4. Should the board of a company appoint executives with a different goal than maximizing value, the share price will reflect this in the form of a lower value.<p>5. Assuming this is a public company, activist investors will accumulate voting shares of a company that is not maximizing its value (or undervalued). The activist investor will then either replace the board members with board members who will appoint executives with the goal of maximizing shareholder value, or they will pressure the existing board to do so themselves. Once the share price has recovered, the investor sells its shares and makes a profit. And the cycle continues.<p>So the reason banks don&#x27;t allow marijuana companies to set up accounts is purely risk and regulatory related. If it was a moral decision, well, morals and ethics are different from person to person, so SOMEONE would do it. Or some activist investor would take over a smaller bank and force them to do it.<p>Individuals can have morals and ethics. If they control a company and choose to enforce their values through their company, well, that&#x27;s their choice. But if the ownership of the company changed, so would the values.",1421180781

Bananas, body piercings, large metal objects are fun here), stroke sensors, and geiger counters (weirdest, but probably the most boring, at least in relatively radiation-free Atlanta).<p>Our toys are hopefully going to be exposing lots of people to programming that have no experience with it, and we&#x27;re excited about creating fun tools to do this.<p>On the back-end, currently the only way to talk to an Arduino over the web is via the NPAPI plugin architecture (deprecated and soon to be highly-restricted by Chrome), or by the Chrome Serial API. So we&#x27;ll be developing a graphical front-end that turns intention (&quot;make all the motors vibrate in this pattern&quot;, &quot;make the accelerometer in my wii nunchuck&quot; increase/decrease vibration pattern frequency&quot;) in to Arduino code, which then gets compiled on the back-end and delivered via Chrome extension to your toy.",1421180760

You can be a critically acclaimed indie game and only have a few million users.<p>Sure you can create a &quot;fremium&quot; game that sucks either time or money from users (where you basically charge people so that they can play the game less; addiction is a terrible thing).

Ratings are life in the app store: If someone sees an app with less than 3 stars, they&#x27;re far less likely to grab it.<p>So because of poor user behavior, now you&#x27;re stuck NOT offering a demo for people to play -- or you have to release your game as &quot;fremium&quot; even if it&#x27;s not designed to suck people&#x27;s wallets dry, which (as I&#x27;ve experienced firsthand) is a recipe for failure.

8882200,comment,8880497,8881416,0,0,rogerbinns,,,"There are multiple layers at play.  For example someone looking a file selection dialog in a gui has at least these layers, lowest level first:<p>- Filesystem implementation (actual on disk bytes)<p>- Filesystem compatibility (adjustments to OS semantics)<p>- Generic filesystem layer in the kernel<p>- System call interface (between userland and kernel)<p>- Userland low level library (eg system call wrappers)<p>- Higher level libraries (eg libc)<p>- User interface libraries<p>- App level modules & libraries<p>The problem with the filesystem being case insensitive is that is the first level above, where there is virtually no context or user information.  That is the hardest place to work out if the user considers Résumé and RESUME to be the same.  The lower down the list the easier it gets.  The important point is that how you store things and how you present does not need to be the same.<p>Command line tools typically use the libc level of things.  It is perfectly possible to make that level so the system appears case insensitive (another poster mentioned Windows doing that).<p>Your Unix command line experience is very much affected by your locale.  For example the ls command does the following:<p>- Sorts filenames<p>- Displays sizes (different locales have different conventions for floating point representation, digit grouping etc)<p>- Displays times<p>Environment variables like $LANG, $LC_*, $TZ etc control this in Unix.<p>Individual programs can also alter behaviour.  For example bash can be configured to do case insensitive filename completion.<p>TLDR: while case insensitivity is a nice user experience for humans, it is awful for the lower layers including filesystems.  The closer a program is to a human, the easier it is to give that nice user experience.  There is no requirement for a case insensitive user experience to then make filesystems also implement that.

If a person decides to buy it and at the same time accepts the possible negative consequences that might arise from such activity, are free to do so. Assuming that those individuals do so in a manner that does not endanger others, there is no ethical issue at hand, that is there is no moral responsibility on the investors nor on the producers purely in the economic sense. Of course there are other venues where an &quot;ethical&quot; issue might arise stemming from addiction or else. But asuming rational people made the initial decision to engage in such activity there is no ethical issue as both parties agreed to a &quot;moral contract&quot;  just as people do when they buy alcohol or tobacco. Do smokers not know the dangers their acitivty when they first decided to do so? To that I have a real life example: my biology teacher a few years back who thoroughly described the effects that smoking has (along with other drugs) and yet he admitted to smoking and he had absolutely no issue with slowly killing himself, he also paid higher insurance costs for the same reasons and once again had no issue with that because he made a rational decision.

There are 3 major desktop OSes, and they all adopt 80&#x27;s view on security i.e. security is mainly about separating users and not necessarily about separating applications.<p>a) I&#x27;d like all applications to be run in sandboxes. That way you don&#x27;t have to care if you application has malware or its processes got hacked. You have that in iOS I believe (but iOS has other problems), but to various degrees it&#x27;s been done in solaris and freebsd, probably can be hacked in linux but no major distro has it as a precooked solution.<p>b) Have OS written in memory safe language. Microsoft got Singularity, I have no idea why that never saw the light of day. That thing could kill Linux on a large portion of the server market. Hopefully we will get something written in Rust now.",1421179319

I can easily exchange Word and PDF copies of my documents with email contacts, never have to worry about which partition my files happen to be on today, and better yet: access my documents from anywhere.<p>I love the fact that Google can take documents from GMail and with one click open them in Google Docs. The ability to share and collaborate on documents is awesome as well. Emailing the same file over and over again to an entire mailing list and making sure not to loose revisions is a thing of the past.<p>Turns out people like to communicate and collaborate and they like the convenience of having their files available everywhere. MS has failed to deliver in this area.",1202875072

114602,comment,114198,114377,0,0,sspencer,,,"I grew up with TVs on a lot as well.  Not the constant background noise that some people grow up with, but a fair amount of TV.  Cartoons Saturday morning and after school when I was little, and then sitcoms or whatever my parents were watching in middle school.<p>However, I also grew up with a truckload of books.  And one day I finally realized that I wasn't really watching TV; I just happened to be keeping my folks company and reading in the same room the TV was on.  I had accidentally (but fortunately!) learned to completely tune TV out.  This led to my current state of constant reading.  To me, books are TV.  Some people have to concentrate to read a book.  I have to concentrate quite hard to pay attention to a TV<i>.  Weird quirk, but I like it!<p></i>  This of course means times other than when I put on a DVD or tape or something specifically to watch and turn all the lights out and get lost.  But I rarely have that much free time.",1202873968

Later on they will get more funding and be able to hire people without handing out (much) equity and when there's a handful of developers already you won't have much power to negotiate.

It's a red flag, tell them why, if they can't fix it asap, walk away.<p>At the end of the day there is no 'fairness' in equity, just equity. Some people will put in more units of work per equity unit then others. This doesn't really matter if each person knows where they stand and what they stand to gain and loose. This allows the members of the group to asses their risks and rewards.<p>No one will be able to asses risk/reward so there could be a massive shock when the reward is put in front of them.",1202873740

Run the main application on a box at a regular hosting provider and have an account on Amazon EC2 which you can use to rapidly create hosts when your load increases (and then shut them off when the load is back down). This way you can keep your server up 24x7 without paying the price of EC2 but still have the option to scale easily.",1202873377

For example, the virtualized hosting plan at Media Temple serves 1Tb of data for $50 per month.<p>If you can justify the cost of the logs/data upload, EC2 is be a good way to run stats or other sorts of heavy-duty batch processing.

Very different paths.    If you have notions of doing both at the same time, give those up.  First year of teaching is very demanding.<p>But if you're still interested anyway, sure, look into it.  I did TFA for a couple years (95 Rio Grande) and it was a good experience.  I wouldn't teach in a public school again unless I was starving, but it was the right thing for me at the time.

Our cost right now is $70 per month, but this will go up as we get more users, which is fine as we are running a subscription model.  The storage costs are so low, we are going to offer a huge amount of data storage for our users.  There is no cost to move data between EC2 and S3.  We now don't worry at all about our hardware, and focus totally on our product and business.

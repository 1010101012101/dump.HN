When I read someone saying ""Invention X is going to <i>change the way we do business forever!</i>"" it registers in my mind as ""Invention X has some interesting consequences that will affect a number of business processes.""  And then I can read the whole article/book/blog through that filter and often feel like the author is making valid points.<p>Then someone else comes along and says ""OMG did you see this guy claiming that Invention X will <i>change the way we do business forever?</i>  What a fool!"" and my first reaction is ""oh, no, he didn't say <i>that</i>...""",1242910789
620337,comment,620208,620262,0,0,antirez,,,"Absolutely true. This is why Redis can do things that with an on-disk storage engine are almost impossible. This our reasoning: in order to really scale, with every kind of DB, if data access is evenly distributed like happens in many web 2.0 apps, the DB must fit in memory anyway (being this OS disk cache, or directly used memory like in Redis). What really matters is <i>persistence</i> and <i>replication</i>. Asynchronous disk dumps gives us all this: data is persistent, replication is fast and non blocking and trivial to setup. And because everything is in RAM we are free to do high level stuff without to care about how data is stored on disk. On disk we have just a ""stupid"" dump that we reload a startup.<p>In some way this is what Paul Graham described in some comment years ago: take all the data in memory in your application, and just write a file in append-mode to reload it later. Basically this is an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Redis :)",1242910655

For example, I like peanut butter a lot, and I think torture is wrong, regardless of the circumstances. The first is a preference; the second is a moral imperative. If asked to defend either proposition, I can say only, ""I am convinced that this is true.""<p>There are, of course, lots of arguments for or against torture or peanut butter, but they aren't moral propositions. For peanut butter, they might be about health; for torture, they might be about what's legal, or what works to stop terrorism.<p>One difference I notice is that preferences extend just to myself, while moral claims extend beyond me, i.e. I think it's fine if you don't like peanut butter, but what I think is moral I think applies to everyone (modulo my uncertainty about it).<p>Perhaps that gets at what irks some people about the article-- the builder's implying not just that his way is good, but that your way is bad.

3074698,comment,3074623,3074688,20,0,jgrahamc,,,"Yes, I am pleased as punch.  Especially since when the Alan Turing petition was successful I bent the ear of the then Prime Minister about funding Bletchley Park.  Not long after a small amount of lottery funding was announced that enabled them to make the bid for this larger amount.  I don't know whether that was really because of me, but it doesn't matter.  This news is great.<p>Here's the email I sent to Downing St. summarizing the situation on September 11, 2009:<p><pre><code>  Kirsty,

  As you can imagine I have an Inbox filled with 
  media requests and congratulatory notes from 
  around the world.  A common theme in these
  mails is a desire to see a memorial of some 
  kind to Alan Turing.

  Three suggestions (in order of popularity):

  1. Find some way to fund Bletchley Park and the
  National Museum of Computing.
  2. Use the Fourth Plinth for a Turing statue
  3. Name the marathon at the 2012 Olympics after
  Turing (he was a very good marathon runner and 
  it's his centenary in 2012).

  All of these are good suggestions.  If the government 
  did #1 you would have my full backing.

  John.

It is bloody marvellous that they have got the money to improve the site.  I triply love Bletchley Park because of: (a) The codebreakers part (b) The National Museum of Computing and (c) it is now the home of the National Radio Centre (for all the UK hams out there) and I studied to be a radio amateur there with MKARS.",1317801540

The other half came from industry groups and wealthy individuals.  But the latter not only fund campaigns, but hire high-powered lobbyists who were usually prior Congressional staff members, and also provide well-paid revolving door jobs, directorships, etc. for politicians when they leave office.  Politicians are funded, courted, bribed, and basically controlled from their political life's cradle to grave.  The entire system is almost completely captured.<p>Unfortunately there are no wealthy special interests who particularly oppose ACTA, just segments of the populace, which don't have the financial clout to buy access to Congress or the President.  Hence things like ACTA is the result, even with a president like Obama.",1317801515

Probably not any emerging country. Certainly not Brazil.<p>I'm Brazilian. Brazil has come a long way in the past 20 years, but corruption is still way worse than the corruption that happens in the US. To sum up, in the US you have a music industry lobby donating money to candidates which then vote in favor of copyright laws. In Brazil we have Colombian drug lords associated with the ruling party.<p>Just because people in UK and US are protesting in the streets it doesn't mean that things are in any way close to the crap that happens in developing countries. It just means you have different standards.",1317801515

So what?<p>The idea that it's only absolute wealth that should matter completely misses the point. That the typical American or European, et al, literally lives like a king (or better) is beside the point. The economy is not a zero-sum game, sure, but politics certainly is, and unfortunately nothing predicts your political power better than the wealth you've accumulated. So the average person in the first world may live like a king, sure, but he has the influence of a peasant or worse.

I highly recommend it if you know the UK at all.<p>In it, he talks about ""playing"" with the law. There was a law in the UK saying all protests within a zone (roughly a mile of parliament) had to be licensed by the police. So he started playing with the law - never breaking it - but playing with it and generally being a right pain in the ass (at times with several thousand friends) to point out how stupid the law was. In the end, the law was removed (altho some people say what it was replaced with was even worse).<p>His half hour radio show is on Youtube. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGZr2m4r7M"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGZr2m4r7M</a> (Illegally, I assume - your call)<p>But anyway, if this law passes play with it to demonstrate how shit it is.

Says so in the Constitution, the document that defines our rights.<p>But wait, there's more.<p>Your argument falls apart even more because you are incorrectly placing the value of a work on the physical representation of the work.  Using your interpretation, the primary value in the book Huckleberry Finn is in the pages of that book, not the words and ideas printed in the book.  Alternatively, if I take Huckleberry Finn, run it through a jumbler and create a document that has all the words rearranged randomly, that it is just as valuable as the original work.<p>Also, you're factually incorrect about the concept of property rights being limited to physical property.  If that were the case, plagiarism would be a legitimate practice.  If theft is limited to the physical representation of a thing, then it should be legitimate for me to sit down and right a copy a work word for word and pass it off as my own.

I tend to believe that, at least regarding domestic matters, there is a lot of FUD being disseminated. Most domestic indicators are trending well and for the global investor, the U.S. is still the BATNA (i.e. to the potential foreign economic alternatives).<p>Thought about differently, if the U.S. were run as a corporation, we would be utter fools to not take advantage of the historically low interest rates that investors are offering us.<p>Don't get me wrong, there are clear fiscal issues with the U.S. over the long-term, but they have been blown way out of proportion and have instilled a sense of fear in the public by those whose interests it suits. Provided we begin addressing these issues and lay out a plan within the next few years, it is very likely that much of the todays concerns will be looked back on as being completely over-hyped by a few hysterical and politically driven interests with a knack for getting disproportional media coverage.

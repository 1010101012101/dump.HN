Therefore, intron removal is not novel.  Furthermore, constructing cDNA from mRNA is not novel because the process is straightforward given observation of retroviruses.  cDNA is informationally identical to mRNA which <i>is</i> naturally occurring.<p>The fact that BRCA cDNA has not occurred in nature (to our knowledge) because no retroviruses (that we know of) carry RNA for it is irrelevant.<p>How does any of that add up to the conclusion that cDNA is patentable?

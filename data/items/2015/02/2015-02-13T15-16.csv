9044960,comment,9039798,9044628,0,0,hga,,,"As I said, <i>inside</i> viewpoint.  I don&#x27;t look at <i>anything</i> the development program produces besides the occasional headline.  Instead, I actually worked at MIT job in 1980, and a job in the end of the &#x27;80s (IT).  I keep up with contacts and friends from those jobs, plus I just plain hung around the campus for a dozen year period including those jobs, and I know how it is at &quot;the sharp end of the spear&quot;.<p>Like helping to allocate a fixed budget and running requisitions through the always skeptical procurement office.  So I know MIT didn&#x27;t switch from cleaning every bathroom every day to &quot;frequent cleaning&quot; because it had a large surplus of funds, and that it&#x27;s been hurting as the Cold War ended, and now with the Great Recession.<p>But you&#x27;re in part moving the goalposts.  No one is denying MIT doesn&#x27;t have a lot of money, we&#x27;re discussing whether it has such an unrestricted surplus it can all of a sudden properly caption all the video it formally publishes.  In a legal regime that&#x27;ll make that all the more expensive and time and energy consuming.  And what will have to be sacrificed to do this, aside from all the videos that will go dark and stay dark.<p>Especially in the case of the targeted OCW, which most certainly doesn&#x27;t have the money to do this, and based on its ability to fund raise after it fulfilled its original mandate, would have trouble doing this, and would also certainly have to initially remove <i>all</i> its videos after an adverse outcome.  Heck, is MIT going to have to institute policy of cost recovery to cover the expenses of making sure no video gets them into further trouble?<p>Another thing to consider is that Harvard and MIT were chosen as the initial targets for the obvious reasons.  Just how much will the world be enriched when this filters down to every college in the US?  Like the one my family shares a property boundary with, which prides itself in providing a low cost education and rents out textbooks.  Right now it&#x27;s very cheap for them to put video on the web.  If you&#x27;re successful, that&#x27;ll end.",1423843162

I find myself all too often in &quot;edge case&quot; situations that would be very easy to fix manually if I could dig around in some settings panel, but modern design philosophy seems to consider including a setting like that to be a design failure in some way.<p>One example is a lack of any kind of manual focus on any phone cameras. If I&#x27;m taking a picture of a person or a cat or something the autofocus does the job right almost every time, but try taking a picture of a small shiny button or something - it&#x27;s a nightmare. If I could press up-down-up-down-A-B-A-B-start-select and get a manual focus slider, I&#x27;d be happy all the time, but instead my few salient memories of fighting with the autofocus have soured me on the whole experience.",1423843133

9044950,comment,9043250,9043279,0,0,gpjt,,,"This, definitely.  Whether or not they&#x27;ll give you a simple percentage number for your stock is a good indicator of whether you can trust them or they&#x27;re trying to pull the wool over your eyes.  There are probably many others.  At the end of the day, if you don&#x27;t get straightforward answers to straightforward questions, then you probably can&#x27;t trust them.<p>Caveat: some questions that sound (in the light of inexperience) like they are straightforward are not to people with more experience of the issue in question.  For example, a naive computer purchaser might ask &quot;can this laptop run my Excel spreadsheets?&quot;.  A naive salesperson might clinch the sale with a simple &quot;yes&quot;.  An experienced salesperson who&#x27;d had to process many returns after such sales might say &quot;well, it depends on how large your spreadsheets are&quot;.  But the naive buyer might think that the experienced salesperson was being non-straightforward and look for a different, less accurate salesperson who seemed more trustworthy because his answers were simpler.<p>Luckily, percentage ownership is pretty easy to be straightforward about.  Except... I&#x27;ve met quite a lot of developers who, after I&#x27;ve explained their options grants to them, were surprised and unhappy to discover that if they get options over (say) 1% of the company, they won&#x27;t always have options over 1% of the company.  They didn&#x27;t understand that when a company takes on new investment, existing investors (including options holders) get diluted.  They thought that their 1% was 1% forever.<p>Which means that if a developer asked me &quot;what percentage of the company will my options amount to&quot; I might respond &quot;x% of the current fully-diluted shares.  But remember that that could go down in percentage terms if we took on further investment.&quot;  And a naive developer might think that the caveat in that sentence meant that I was being less-than-sincere (rather than being as honest as I know how) and move on.<p>So it&#x27;s complicated.",1423843023
9044949,comment,9044388,9044388,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>“Cultural fit” is one of the most corrosive ideas in the tech industry.</i><p>Culture is super-important-- in large part, to help make sure that the 47-year-old female Haskell badass and the 22-year-old male Ruby rockstar work well together-- but &quot;cultural fit&quot; is often used as an excuse for shitty behavior and exclusionist hiring practices.<p><i>Older developers, for example, bring a lot to the table. One study found that developers actually get better with age.</i><p>Very true. But people who&#x27;ve been around the block aren&#x27;t going to carry a pager except for a project that is absolutely career-making for them (with both internal and external credibility as rewards) or when they&#x27;re owners (and 0.05% ain&#x27;t ownership). I hate the age discrimination culture but I know why it&#x27;s there: there&#x27;s a fear that older developers will &quot;poison&quot; the young with, you know, real world experience and knowledge about the industry and how it actually works, and of the games often played against politically inept engineers.<p><i>People often say that tech companies must be near other tech companies in order to succeed.</i><p>The Valley&#x27;s about funding, not other tech companies. The west coast of the US is the easiest place in the world to raise VC. It&#x27;s still difficult, and the process takes a long time and is generally obnoxious, but it&#x27;s easier there than elsewhere.<p>Also, don&#x27;t downplay &quot;managed outcomes&quot; (e.g. acqui-fails) that are bad for employees but good for founders&#x27; careers. Bay Area VCs can call in a favor they&#x27;re owed, have the thing bought, and get the founders popped into executive positions at Google or Facebook. Harder to do that in Utah. This doesn&#x27;t matter to employees but it&#x27;s important for many VC-funded founders, especially since the VCs will push you to take on a much higher degree of risk than most founders would otherwise want.<p><i>They want privacy. “They say they work in an open office plan and wish they could go back to a cubicle,” he tells us.</i><p>Cubicles suck, too. Private or semi-private (i.e. two people) offices are the way to go. They&#x27;re not that expensive. If you must use an open-ish plan, then give engineers booth-style seating where they have walls at their back. Open-back visibility is borderline abusive.<p><i>Don’t have the money for Swedish massages or an in-office coffee bar? There are less expensive perks.</i><p>Google&#x27;s &quot;free massage&quot; perk is overstated. When I was there, you got one (for free) per year. Any more, and you have to pay for it. (That said, the price is quite fair.) This is not to nick Google-- I don&#x27;t think that any company should be expected to pay for <i>unlimited</i> massage-- but just to point out that the competition ain&#x27;t that stiff on the massage front. One 60-minute massage per year? That&#x27;s about $80.<p>Many of those perks are cheap insofar as they&#x27;re effective marketing expenditures. For $80 per employee, Google gets &quot;free massage&quot; out there.<p>Still, as a cynical 31-year-old, I&#x27;d rather have few of the &quot;cute&quot; perks and more salary. 401k matching and health benefits are important; massage, I can get on the market.<p>Finally, for one item that was missed... <i>Rethink equity</i>. Personally, I think finance-style profit-sharing (even if the bonus system can be really political) is superior. Also, equity has an uncanny valley. The amounts that non-executive employees get in startups are, quite often, so insignificant that I&#x27;d rather have it all in cash. If you are going to make equity part of the package, cut out slices that will make people actually care. This means 3-5% for employee #10 and 0.5-1% for employee #50... the actual numbers seem to be closer to 0.3% and 0.04%, which are in the &quot;who gives a fuck&quot; range.<p>People gripe about Wall Street&#x27;s bonus system (in which profits are shared but employees, except for upper-tier executives, are not expected to acquire stock in the company) but it&#x27;s a much better and fairer model of profit-sharing than what Silicon Valley does.",1423843023

The Das Keyboard is pretty vanilla, although I do wish I had gotten the one with labeled keycaps, but Amazon was out of stock at the time.<p>Overall, I prefer mechanical keyboards, but I think that is primarily because the build quality on them is just higher than your typical trash.  The mechanical switches are much less mushy than the rubber dome style, although they can collect dust and hair more than more sealed-in types.  The biggest thing is that the keyboard doesn&#x27;t have some bizarre layout, and just adheres to the bog-standard IBM PC keyboard pattern, so that I can switch between keyboards without cursing at the keys that aren&#x27;t where I expect them to be.",1423842491

These are controlled via the console in the house, the web and the app:<p>- Alarm<p>This is nice because you can enable it after you leave the house, which is nice if you are in a hurry or just simply forget. Maybe not a killer feature.<p>- Front door lock<p>Same deal here, but it also lets me open the door for people remotely or grant them temporary access. It&#x27;s a little janky, I imagine that the Lockitron is better. My main concern is battery life, which it alerts me about long before the batteries (4 AA) die. My second concern is that the gears inside will wear out, though it has lasted for ~3 years so far.<p>- Thermostat<p>Super convenient for Florida. We travel a lot so it&#x27;s nice to kill the AC before we leave and still have a cool house half an hour before we get back home. There is an automated &quot;Nest-like&quot; web interface for this but I don&#x27;t really trust it. Scheduling works great.<p>- Pan & tilt camera<p>This is more of a toy but it&#x27;s cool, the other day we saw our dog tearing up the trash can in the living room so we ran home and stopped her (and put the can in the garage).<p>None of this stuff is perfect, and you are probably better off (quality and price wise) by going with Nest + Wemo + Lockitron + some alarm company, but we&#x27;re still happy with it all.",1423842024

9044761,comment,9044131,9044131,0,0,GSimon,,,"Nice a topic I know a lot about on HN<p>Mechanical keyboards are more enjoyable to type on for one so that&#x27;s something to consider on it&#x27;s own. In terms of your pinky getting sore after long usage it might be less likely to occur with a mechanical keyboard because most mechanical keyboard switches don&#x27;t require you to press as hard to register a keystroke compared to a non-mechanical/rubber-dome keyboard like the one you have.<p>Most mechanical keyboards today use Cherry MX switches, there are a variety of different Cherry MX switches to choose from. Some are louder than others and have a different tactile feedback. A good reference to get an idea of what I mean can be found at this link here: <a href=""http://www.mechanicalkeyboards.com/mechanical_switches.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mechanicalkeyboards.com/mechanical_switches.php</a><p>It&#x27;s a bit difficult to know which Cherry MX switch is right for you right away, you can narrow it down to some degree beforehand but it&#x27;s difficult to have much certainty of which you&#x27;ll like best until you try them. You can visit your local computer store (Frys, or if you&#x27;re in Canada than Canada Computers) and try some out there. Otherwise you can order a switch tester: <a href=""http://www.cmstore.eu/cm-storm/keyboards/mechanical-key-switch-tester/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cmstore.eu/cm-storm/keyboards/mechanical-key-swit...</a> and decide from there, Coolermaster will also give you a discount on your mechanical keyboard if you buy one of their mechanical keyboards from them after purchasing one.<p>One of the most popular, entry-level, mechanical keyboards is the Coolermaster Quick Fire Rapid and the Quick Fire XT. It&#x27;s a safe purchase and good value.<p>There are a bunch of other factors to consider with mechanical keyboards as well than would take forever to get into here. Some of those factors would be keyboard layout, the standard layout is what you&#x27;ll see on the  Quick Fire Rapid/XT (i.e the backspace/shift/enter keys are the standard sizing/spacing).<p>Another consideration is what type of keycaps you want on your keyboard. You can buy aftermarket keycpas for premium that are usually better than the ones that come with you keyboard, and with mechanical keyboards you can easily replace your keycaps. This is where keyboard layout, as mentioned earlier, is important because if you want to replace the keycaps at some point it will be difficult to find a full set of them for a keyboard with a non-standard keyboard layout.<p>In terms of ergonomic mechanical keyboards some exist but they aren&#x27;t that prevalent. I would recommend getting a keyboard with a standard layout and progressing from there if necessary.<p>If you want to learn more check out the Wiki on reddit for the mechanicalkeyboard sub: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/index</a><p>and if you have any questions you can ask them there are well, there is a thread stickied at the top for people to ask questions.<p>As another user mentionned deskthority and geekhack are good resources also, although they have more of an established community and although helpful are less eager to walk newcomers through the buyer process. They would prefer to answer more specific questions with regards to mechanical keyboards, as opposed to the &#x27;what keyboard should I buy if I should even get one in the first place&#x27; type of questions.",1423841132

If he defects, you get a horrible outcome if you cooperate.

The payoff matrix has been altered....eg., by severe penalties for ratting, which give the player a much worse outcome for defecting. Those penalties wouldn&#x27;t be necessary if the dilemma weren&#x27;t real.

Browns activate halfway down, but you won&#x27;t know that using unconnected keys.<p>Figure out which switch feels the best to you. Research keyboards that provide that switch type as an option.<p>Purchase, making sure to get the correct SKU.

What&#x27;s being done is already illegal and already being detected by an authority with the power to do something.<p>So the usual handwavy appeal to &quot;regulation&quot; that is so common I&#x27;m comfortable implicitly reading it into the above criticism despite it not explicitly containing it is not enough.<p>I&#x27;m generally libertarian, but behind that libertarianism is not the belief that the government &quot;can&#x27;t do anything&quot;, but more the observation that a lot of people go through the following process:<p><pre><code>    1. Identify a problem. Maybe. (Accuracy is optional at this stage.)
    2. Claim we need &quot;regulation&quot;. No details given.
    3. Case closed!
</code></pre>
and a great deal of my libertarianism doesn&#x27;t come from &quot;faith in markets&quot;, but the fact that <i>it&#x27;s not that easy</i>. You can&#x27;t just assume into existence massive regulatory regimes, with significant costs and oversight issues, and then just <i>assume</i> that the problem is solved without evidence, precisely because of stories like this and things like &quot;regulatory capture&quot;. It&#x27;s explicitly not that <i>I</i> have a magical solution (and if you feel inclined to reply, please read that three times first), it&#x27;s that I believe the problems we face are way harder than airy handwaves about &quot;regulation&quot;, case closed, problem solved, why can&#x27;t people just understand that regulation will just solve everything and let&#x27;s politically attack anyone who says otherwise.<p>Nope, it&#x27;s a <i>hard problem</i>. It&#x27;s a lot of hard problems, and people who just attack industry and handwave haven&#x27;t even properly engaged with the problems, let alone <i>solved</i> anything. <i>The fact that there is such widespread belief in the airy handwaves of &quot;regulation&quot; is itself a primary cause of things like this sort of dysfunction</i>... it becomes a political attack to claim that the regulation has a problem because of <i>course</i> it&#x27;s working, how can it not? It is literally inconceivable, and to emphasize, I mean, literally not expressible in the relevant neurons in people&#x27;s brains. People treat it as an atomic entity that can not be further investigated, rather than as a complicated mechanism in a complicated system that requires systemic analysis, and the resulting possibility that on occasion, yes, the regulatory agents will be broken.<p>(From a positive perspective, my libertarianism comes from the observation that markets are freaking <i>powerful</i> and regulatory regimes, since they are created by people whose thinking is biased into an &quot;us vs. markets&quot; modality rather than the aforementioned &quot;systemic analysis&quot; often screw up, either by missing chances to harness the power of the market, or by fighting them in ineffective or inefficient (in the usual sense of the term, not EMH) ways. This blindness results in regulatory regimes that start from day one by first dropping their most powerful tool on the ground. Unsurprisingly, this often results in less effective regulation. We need regulation because not even I want to live in a raw market-dominated world, but nobody wins when it&#x27;s done stupidly because of preconceived moralistic notions about markets, which are in many ways best conceived of and treated as natural forces rather than demonic embodiments of pure evil or something equally silly, and thus something best <i>harnessed</i> properly, not fought and pilloried. In this case, I&#x27;d suggest that a more market-comprehending regulatory regime would understand that transparency and openness are key to properly keeping the system functioning properly, and that the top priority the first time they received any information like this should have been getting word out to people. But, that&#x27;s not part of how they think, because the idea that this could have been nipped in the bud much earlier by <i>harnessing</i> the power of information flows in a market simply isn&#x27;t in their DNA. In all likelihood they wouldn&#x27;t hardly have needed to do much of anything else, but instead the inevitable logic of a market-fearing regulator, through several steps I&#x27;m not explaining, leads to this sort of coverup with distressing frequency.)",1423839695

I also think that the confidence interval is often misinterpreted as a credible interval. But that does not mean that the credible interval is the right choice for every analysis.<p>From a purely practical sense, the data is fixed when you have your sample or have collected your time series data. This is the data you have and you can observe it. I do agree that the data may change when you collect more samples or get more history. But the Bayesian framework is set up well to handle that, as today&#x27;s result can be tomorrow&#x27;s prior.<p>Having said all this, I don&#x27;t think this debate takes away from the use cases outlined in this post. This is not meant to read as &quot;Bayesian versus frequentist&quot; but rather to highlight some important benefits of Bayesian analysis. For example, if I am building a pricing model that will be used to make actual decisions and my classical model is spewing out strange coefficients that do not seem to be consistent with external data and common sense. I want to infuse that model with outside information before I use the model to make real life decisions, or just shrink it.

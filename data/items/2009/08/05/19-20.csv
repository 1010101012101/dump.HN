744029,comment,743286,743286,0,0,jganetsk,,,"OCaml's internals benefit, in particular, from the GC needing very little layout information. All non-conservative GCs need to know what's a pointer and what isn't. Many languages, from Java to Haskell, associate this info, at runtime, with each heap object (and stack frame!). This is actually done quite elegantly in Haskell (stack frames and thunks are structurally equivalent: returning from a function is effectively popping a thunk of the stack and tail-calling it). Java's design, as a language, is constrained by this. For example, you cannot use a primitive in a type parameter for a generic for this reason.<p>OCaml doesn't need this, although every heap object is still tagged (for various reasons) and stores the size in the header. The OCaml GC can tell what's what by just inspecting the value itself (and some block tags imply no-follow, like float array, string, opaque, etc). In effect, OCaml's distinction between primitives (value itself passed around in machine word) and non-primitives (pointer to block passed around in machine word) is invisible to the programmer.<p>Also unlike Haskell and Java (not to say there's much in common with these two, but goes to show how OCaml's implementation differs from those of a wide spectrum of languages), very little type information is stored in the tag.",1249499597

Keep in mind, I've been 20 for 5 whole months now (on Friday), so I'm not _technically_ a teen.  That said, it was recent enough to remember what I and others thought about it then.<p>What's important to remember is that we all grew up on Facebook, so I'm going to explain things about ""twitter"" as a Facebook user.  They might not all be accurate, but they are all more or less believed.<p>RT/Re-tweeting is analogous to seeing an interesting facebook status, and copying it to yours.  Even if it's spectacular, at best, people won't care, and at worst, you're seen as unoriginal.<p>@'ing It's like using your status message to say something to a friend.  You don't need to do that, people don't care what you have to say.  Instead, write on their wall.  It still shows up in minifeeds and people can still see it (more private messages go through facebook messages), but it doesn't have the undertone of ""EVERYONE should know what I'm saying to you"" (maybe it should?)<p>Tweeting in general - Tweets are analogous to facebook statuses.  The thing about statuses though, is that no one reads them.  I know almost no one who bothers to keep their status up to date.  On the other hand, people are tweeting every 10 minutes during ""important events"".<p>If you want to provide a narrative, use pictures.  I'd much rather look at an album then see ""Just got to the party"" ""It's kind of lame"" ""Now we're dancing"" ""Everyone's so messed up"" ""Now we're at Denny's""<p>Among teens I know, only the most vain and the most geeky have twitter accounts.",1249499419

It would also help the legislative process - you propose you change, and everyone can run their test-suite on it, and see if and how they'll be affected.<p>My first though was the software that the European Union has been developing (I don't know the state of it) that, on the fly, translates what the writer is typing into a intermediate language and back into the writers language - that way ambiguities and idioms are caught immediately. It's not exactly useful for poetry, but should help in creating concise and unambiguous texts, even in just a single language.",1249499270

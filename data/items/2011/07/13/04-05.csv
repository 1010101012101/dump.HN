It can't possibly indicate harmful intent, as he knows the person he's impersonating isn't going to do anything. That said, if he'd robbed a bank wearing a Nixon mask[1], it's still a robbery.

2757743,comment,2755527,2755527,1,0,naeem,,,"I've started using Interstate with my team. The core features are great, and it definitely helps to get organized. The one fundamental problem that I've found early on with the product, which will be a severe detriment unless they can find a workaround, is that there isn't much that keeps me coming back. The only thing that would keep me coming back is a constant stream of updates, but the way that the system is set-up currently, updates come infrequently enough that I'm not concerned enough to regularly check it. This might change with a bigger team and once we get more involved, though. I think one way to improve is to build some type of real-time collaboration platform to supplement the core product. That may be too great a pivot, but the ability to actually use it as a communication suite for my team while building our roadmap is compelling.",1310530317

He uses his technical skills both to inflict harm and to avoid getting caught. Indeed, there is every reason to believe that the victims identified in this case are not his only victims. When Barry Ardolf is released from prison at the end of his term of commitment, he will do something like this again to someone else who has angered him, only this time he will be even more careful. The only way to prevent that is to incarcerate him for a very long time.</i><p>I'm absolutely inclined to agree with them. The prosecution earlier notes that even in this case, Ardolf's letter to the judge expresses no remorse for attempting to frame his neighbor for child pornography at his place of work, claiming instead that he had been ""victimized"" by the neighbor. Ardolf sounds criminally insane to me. I'm glad he was locked up before he did something far worse.",1310530256

You have done a fabulous job in making Facebook and scaling to a massive user base. We love to use Facebook and are more than happy to acknowledge it.<p>The point we are discussing is about the policy implementation and its consistency.\nFirst of all it is not new for Facebook to take away someone else's URL. See this post from early 2010 - <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/23/facebook-vanity-url-harman/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/23/facebook-vanity-url-harman/</a> . Clearly the argument you have around ""If we wanted it for our own use, we would have been up-front about that"" does not hold much to the test of history.<p>Second, the work on Facebook-Skype integration seems to have started around November, 2010 - <a href=""http://blog.greenanysite.com/index.php/2010/11/facebook-video-chatting-with-skype/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.greenanysite.com/index.php/2010/11/facebook-vide...</a>. We all know software product life-cycles and how marketing pages are made/thought. Let's not discuss how that works.<p>Coming to specifics on this application disabling. Here are some facts to clear the air:\n1. In sending Video Calling Invitations, we were not doing anything different from the following applications: Video Chat Rounds, Tiny Chat, vChatter.\n2. When we exchanged some emails with the Facebook representative, we highlighted the fact that we being singled out when there were bunch of other apps having much worse policy implementations.\n3. After three months of our reporting this, these apps are still functional. This demonstrates Facebook indeed had a vested interest in disabling our application.\n4. Why would Facebook recommend developers to relaunch their application at a <i>different</i> URL when the application is known to be spammy.<p>There is no point trying to defend an error, which may have happened in ignorance or in intent. Nor is my intention to prove anything. We have merely stated the facts and it is for people to decide. We have moved on from this incident and as an organization we have far more important aspirations than to worry about a Facebook application.<p>I am responding to this, as I believe it is only fair to put the entire perspective in place.<p>Best, Nimit",1310529727

We  were actually really surprised about the prices for building material but the good news is that the community is coming together to provide the labor to make it happen. Very inspiring story of the guy who is behind this project. His grandmother (who is illiterate) insisted that he would go to the school regularly. This enabled him to get a scholarship for a statistics undergrad program in the US and he just graduated from UofU with a PhD in Public Health with emphasis on bio statistics. He has now returned to Ghana to rebuild the school (which is cancelled during rainy season as the roof is totally leaky and turns the school into a mud pool).",1410217128

8287755,comment,8287479,8287479,2,0,christop,,,"> And it wasn’t just Spain, it was all of southern Europe and more. Even euro-area countries with sound finances, like Finland and the Netherlands, have suffered deep and prolonged slumps.<p>I hadn&#x27;t heard of troubles in those two countries before before, though I&#x27;m sure like pretty much every country in Europe — or indeed the world — they didn&#x27;t go entirely unscathed during a global financial crisis.  Scotland, the UK as a whole and other western European countries aren&#x27;t exactly in the depths of recession and unemployment that have been happening in Spain and Greece, for example.<p>Note the lack of mention of Norway (not that it&#x27;s a eurozone country), which is in an incredible financial position with a $900bn fund made up primarily by saving a portion of oil revenue.  While Norway has had 15 years to amass this huge fund, this is the model that Scotland would like to follow — as after independence it would have control of its north sea oil and gas revenue.<p>> In short, everything that has happened in Europe since 2009 or so has demonstrated that sharing a currency without sharing a government is very dangerous.<p>What happened was dangerous, though arguably the use of a shared currency and central bank helped countries support one another.<p>In any case, the most likely outcome in the case of Scottish independence is a currency union with the rest of the UK, in a similar manner to the Euro.  If the Bank of England denies Scotland the use of its assets, it will also have to forgo Scotland&#x27;s share of the liabilities, essentially wiping out Scotland&#x27;s share of UK debt.  So it&#x27;s unlikely that Scotland&#x27;s currency would be completely separate in any case.<p>All in all, while there are naturally unknown factors, there are plenty of reasons to seek independence and just in terms of economics — even excluding oil and gas revenue — an independent Scotland would appear to be in a good financial position.",1410216561

(the answer may vary depending on industry, location, position, etc.)\n-\tDo I need to go to a top X school to receive a decent ROI?\n-\tWhat are the costs (tangible, intangible, opportunity, etc.) with each option above? This is a complex question with several sub-components. For example: a full time MBA would mean two years less career progression on top of salary loss.<p>There are many variables that can be difficult to estimate:\n-\tActual cost of an MBA\n-\tOpportunity cost of lost salary (full time MBA)\n-\tOpportunity cost of lost salary increase (no MBA), if any\n-\tNetworking value of attending certain schools\n-\tEtc. ad nausea<p>Of course, many of these are recurring. Which rate do you use to estimate current value of the time series? Student loan rates if you need financing? Discount rate used to quantify risk of any of the options? More uncertainties…<p>I created a spreadsheet to estimate my various models and came up with the following solution for my particular use case (YMMV!):<p>I enrolled in a professional MBA program from a top 25 public school (part time, one weekend per month, 16 months,  with online work to supplement) of which my employer would cover some of my costs (no stipulations on repayment).\nNet result? I felt that I learned a lot and that the program was worthwhile for me. The most important piece of knowledge: how to best find out what I do not know about a given situation. I will never be a corporate accountant, but I now know what I do not know about corporate accounting (A LOT!). I know now that I do not know a lot about valuating pre-revenue startups, etc.<p>Do I feel that every person in my cohort received the same amount of value from the program? No. You get out what you put in.<p>Do I think an MBA is right for you (or anyone)? That depends on your situation. A driven person can learn most, if not all, of the material on their own.

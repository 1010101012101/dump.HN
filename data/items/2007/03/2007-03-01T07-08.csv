Digging a little deeper, though, one notices a couple of quotes:<p>""But he compares what he and Fake are doing to what record label executives do, searching out the best talent.""<p>Someone who compares himself favorably to a record label executive in today's world is out of touch with how the target demographic for Brickhouse products feels about such things.  I don't know how much trust I could place in Horowitz's decisions regarding this new internal ""startup"".<p>""Horowitz...said the figure would be somewhere between a pat on the back and an acquisition-size bonus.""<p>If I were a Yahoo employee, I don't think I'd feel too reassured that my hard work would get appropriately recognized.

We truly are conditioned to believe that getting a job is the best way to provide for your family.  I grew up in a restaurant, so the principle of working hard for what you earn was instilled in me at an early age.  Now, thanks mostly to pg's essays, I realize that the best way to provide is to work smart - start a company, give it your all for a few years, and let it generate income as a return for the wealth I've created.",1172733660

The next shot should have been of said dude falling over as his CG moves outside the convex hull of his feet.",1172732746

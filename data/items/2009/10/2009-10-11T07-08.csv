I'm not an expert on your life, so this is just a guess.<p>However, the one that really stands out for me is: ""Did another webapp for one of the student clubs. (Someone else also wrote one and theirs was better, so everyone (including me) just used that instead.)""<p>In your other examples, there were external factors that created large barriers to finishing the project. That happens sometimes, but with this one, you simply ... gave up.<p>There's not necessarily a negative connotation there; you could have made a perfectly logical decision after factoring in your interest in the project, the amount of work it would take to compete with the other webapp, and whether you had any immediate ideas that would make your version better. But, it looks like you're asking why you haven't been successful yet, and here's a case where there really wasn't anything stopping you.<p>Aside from that, I think most folks here have a pretty big stack of failures and dead projects. I sure do -- I've even lost track of them. I've got failures in inventions, big what-if ideas, political ventures, software projects, business leads, and on and on.<p>As long as you're able to get something valuable out of those failures, some lesson or some insight or some social connections or something, then it's not really a failure.<p>It's just more experience.",1255247918

While joecode is correct that you might need to be more realistic about some of your goals, if you keep trying, you will find success, even if it's modest.<p>If you're interested in doing another webapp, I say do one start-to-finish completely on your own. That way, you don't have to rely on the dedication of other people for it to be successful. Also, try to reach out and find other people interested in tech entrepreneurship at your school - I've found a surprising amount here (Washington University in St. Louis) just by poking around.",1255247783

The stock market is a zero-sum game where most of the profits go to the high end of a Pareto distribution.

Very few people are writing multiple web apps, multiple papers, etc. at 18.<p>My advice to you would be to seek out a mentor who sees themself in you. That could be a graduate student, a young prof, or an entrepreneur.<p>Forget all that shit about ""socializing"". Completely agree that things get better as you get older. Clubs are overrated. Work out hard and get a decently hot girlfriend if you want. But then get back to work.<p>PS: stay ambitious. Read Richard Hamming on ambition.

Its not really for people who don't know math, but for people (like me) who know <i>some</i> math but have never looked into the paradox.  The key here is to explain what pieces means and the whole cloud idea.  With that, I sorta get it (I think so anyway, I'd need to understand the proof better to see if my intuitive feeling is correct).<p>That being said, I notice a problem immediately.  Why do we need 4 pieces?  From the explanation, its pretty much giving a sort of ""algorithm"" for creating the 4 (or 5) pieces.  Essentially, start somewhere, and go around and around, and put each ""atom"" into one of 4 sets.  I.e. the first ""atom"" goes into the first bucket, the second atom into the second bucket, etc...  Then, take bucket 1 and 2, and translate them (really just to avoid intersection) and then rotate set 2 so that the atoms are ""half way"" between those of set 1, and do the same rotation for bucket 4.<p>So... why not just call buckets 1 and 3 ""bucket A"" and buckets 3 and 4 ""bucket B"" and just do the translation?<p>I know enough to know that my ""algorithm"" doesn't work, but its what the intuition here suggests.  So, there is still some gap in my understanding.<p>I'm curious how far an intuitive explanation can go.  I'll take a look at the link someone else gave below, but does anyone have an intuitive answer to my question?",1255247171

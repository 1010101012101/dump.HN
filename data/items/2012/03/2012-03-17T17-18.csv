3717627,comment,3717263,3717263,2,0,rprasad,,,"Most of the people who died from tornados over the past few months <i>knew</i> the tornados were headed their way or were in the vicinity.  The problem was that they were unable to leave their homes in time because the tornado touched down too close, rendering it more dangerous to leave for a secure shelter (i.e., malls or schools, which must be fortified against tornado damage) than to simply remain put and hope the tornado(s) missed them.  The death toll in the Henryville outbreak in early March was caused by a supercell storm system which produced a large number of F4 multiple-vortex tornados (one F4 tornado surrounded by numerous smaller tornados of varying strengths). Multiple-vortex tornados are especially dangerous because they affect a much larger area.<p>In the Midwest they use tornado warning sirens to alert the populace to tornados.  The sirens have several forms of power and are really freaking loud.  They're also extremely quick to sound these alarms, since they've had decades of practice at this.  They use a combination of sources for this, so that the alarms are usually sounded within seconds of a tornado sighting.<p>The problem in a nutshell with this app is that anyone who does not hear the tornado warning siren will not be in a position to notice the alert from the app.  Also, without a mechanism for updating the tornados, it may actually cause more harm than good: for example, if tornados are not cleared from the app quickly enough, people may be deterred from seeking shelter by the presence of a tornado that is no longer there.",1332006836

If I want to update Firefox on Windows XP, I can do that without Windows forcing me to update to Windows 7 as part of the deal.  That's the problem.  Updating Firefox on Ubuntu 11.04 after a certain (very soon in the future) point in time necessitates an update to Ubuntu XX.YY.<p>In fact you're precisely illustrating my point with your example.  That people can choose to stick to XP because they don't like 7 is precisely analogous to wanting to stick with Gnome 2 because I dislike Unity.  But the difference is that I can do that in Windows because I can still get app updates in XP for over a decade, but I can't in Linux because app updates are tied to the entire massive distro and everything else that goes with it... often every 6 months.<p>It certainly is possible to upgrade parts of the system using esoteric (to the average-Joe) solutions like PPAs or compiling from source or being forced to switch to a different desktop environment.

3717547,comment,3717303,3717303,7,0,Isofarro,,,"There's at least two phases of developing code. There's the solving of the problem at hand, and getting the expression of that solution towards syntactically correctness.<p>Colour syntax highlighting is merely a ""live syntax checker"" - albeit not as good as a compiler or linter (it's simpler in nature). But the value it adds is sufficient to make it a useful aid. It's the coding equivalent of Word's squiggly red line spell-checker, it draws attention to things that may be issues when the colour highlighting looks odd.<p>If the colours are distracting, then it is the colours that are the issue, not the concept of syntax highlighting. So subdue them enough.<p>Colour syntax highlighting is a visual indicator that the code looks syntactically correct. With that as a confidence indicator it's easier to dive into the logic itself, knowing that you're mostly on solid ground syntax wise.<p>Plus, colour provides quick visual hooks to various parts of the code. It allows skimming through the code to find the prescient part easier. Yes, it makes it easier to skip past commented out code -- those should be deleted at an appropriate point. And it's easier to delete that commented out code when it's colour coded than without.<p>Developers fight with their code on multiple levels. Colour-coding helps deal with one particular level of that code - syntactic correctness.<p>Developers know that syntactical correctness doesn't mean the problem is solved. It just means that the attempted solution to that problem is considered syntactically correct.<p>I think the only interesting point in the author's piece is the point that English text is more difficult to read when it's randomly coloured. When we get to an x-Generation Language levels where we can develop programs in plain English, I'd agree with the author that colour syntax highlighting doesn't add sufficient value at that point. But we are still stuck in a hybrid computer-friendly constrained language constructs, and with those constrains, colour syntax highlighting assists developers to confirm the code is syntactically valid.",1332004986

The point where PPAs fall short is that the user still needs to add a repository when all he wants is to install a package.<p>I maintain `apt-get install <a href=""https://foobar.com/pkg`"" rel=""nofollow"">https://foobar.com/pkg`</a> is where it's at. Feel free to query me all you want (""really add this untrusted repo?"", ""fetch updates from there?"", ""trust this key?"" etc.), but by all means make it a one-liner. Not three, not two, <i>one</i>.<p>And have proper procedures for all the little corner cases where PPAs fall down. I.e. when the repo goes away or changes URL, when the signing key changes, etc.<p>It's a matter of polish. Non-technical users need that polish. And technical users like it, too.",1332003603

9116159,comment,9113119,9113119,0,0,geebee,,,"This is a good article.  I didn&#x27;t know about the #NoEstimates hashtag.  It&#x27;s been interesting to read.<p>In general, I think that any discussion that informs people about the difficulty of making estimates where software is concerned is a good thing.  I&#x27;m not delighted that the term &quot;NoEstimates&quot; sounds a little radical and defines itself (as the post mentioned) by what it is not.  I do think that &quot;nosql&quot; may have harmed itself a bit that way as well, even though it really means &quot;maybe not always sql depending on your problem&quot;, which is pretty good advice.<p>I think the real problem, also mentioned in the article, is this: &quot;Managers have a habit of treating developers’ back-of-the-envelope estimates as contractual deadlines, then freaking out when they’re missed. And wait, there’s more: Developers, terrified by that prospect, put more and more energy into obsessive trips down estimation rabbit-holes.&quot;<p>This has come up in previous discussions, and it&#x27;s an important point.  The agile manifesto recommends we value &quot;Customer collaboration over contract negotiation&quot;.  But this blog entry about estimates identifies the problem here - casual estimates later become contractual deadlines (even if you aren&#x27;t in a formal contract situation, even if it&#x27;s all internal, your name next to a task and deadline = contract).  So in this sense, the movement away from waterfall can simply lull developers into a casual &quot;back of envelope&quot; estimate that turns into &quot;but you said you&#x27;d get it done by friday!&quot;  It&#x27;s almost enough to get you to want to go back to waterfall.  After all, if you&#x27;re going to be held to a deadline, it helps to have a document specifying <i>exactly</i> what you would or wouldn&#x27;t do.  At least then (since specs always change), both of you are perpetually &quot;in breach.&quot;<p>Within this context, yeah, I can see why some people would want to just do away with estimates.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t quite see that happening.  If people are trying to decide whether to fund a project (or budget for it), &quot;how long, roughly, will this take, and how much, roughly, will it cost&quot; is reasonable.  Of course, what &quot;this&quot; is needs to be defined, but not to waterfall levels of detail.  The key is probably a better understanding of what these estimates really mean and how they should be interpreted by an organization.",1424991382

We eat a lot more vegetables and fresh food and it forces us to come up with new recipes to use up ingredients. A few weeks ago we got some chayote, which I had never seen in my life, but we ended up making a really good stew with it.<p>Even though we aren&#x27;t getting a meal plan and instructions with our box of meat and produce, it still feels like part of the work is done. I see it as a good in-between option: not as expensive as the meal delivery services and not as much work as just planning and shopping for meals from scratch. I can see how it could be overwhelming for beginners, though, if they receive a bunch of ingredients they aren&#x27;t familiar with.<p>I think that&#x27;s where building the intuition and creative-thinking part of cooking becomes important. We&#x27;re working on balancing this with CookAcademy -- trying to walk users through the cooking process in great detail, without letting them rely on that detail too much. We hope that teaching them the concepts behind what they&#x27;re doing and encouraging experimentation will help them eventually rely on their senses and experience rather than relying on timers and measuring cups. To me, cooking feels like much less of a chore when you can get to that point.",1424991317

Land access is inherently limited by real world access problems that don&#x27;t obey free market ideology.<p>A free market for public utilities would start from the public, i.e. government, OWNING said infrastructure outright and then allowing private corporations to lease the right to use it to provide service. Only the government has the legal right to eminent domain so it can build roads and public utilities and generally seize land for the common good - private corporations would have to negotiate with every landowner whose property needs to be crossed, and that is obviously unworkable in the real world.<p>From the current situation - which is a hodge podge of municipal services, private corporate services, agreements that limit competition, coupled with land access needs only eminent domain can provide - the only way to arrive at this paradise of &quot;free market competition&quot; is for the government to nationalize the entire thing, void all contracts with private service providers, and recreate the rules to allow competition among service providers by renting/licensing the infrastructure that is owned by the public. Otherwise it would take decades for existing agreements to expire or be renegotiated, and any improvement still have to rely on access and easements and various forms of eminent domain anyway.<p>I cannot imagine the unending howling of the libertarian-type crowd if this were to happen.

I&#x27;d go so far as to say that&#x27;s the case in most of the USA--Comcast almost certainly has some level of private security at most of its locations, even (or perhaps especially) in urban areas.<p>I&#x27;m not sure, though, how that undermines the point that Comcast shares in the monopoly of violence with the government. It doesn&#x27;t make its violence independent of government (at least in the USA): small matters can be dealt with most quickly by those private forces, but in more serious matters, Comcast would call on government violence to provide either a supporting or primary role. The people in conflict with Comcast could do the same, but the difference is that Comcast would actually get the government&#x27;s help.<p>Note that this isn&#x27;t a claim of fascist corporatism or anything: it&#x27;s part of a healthy society, and really the only way I can imagine a civil society I&#x27;d want to live in working.

Trying to pay off $9000 in fixed costs with $30/mo internet simply isn&#x27;t going to happen if a competitor can swoop in and offer the same service for $20/mo with no investment in infrastructure. If the cost is lower, due to having either higher population density or more available infrastructure to scaffold off of, this becomes a less-insane business prospect.<p>But I&#x27;m somewhat confused by your initial sentiment. At least four small, local ISPs have investigated installing last mile connectivity to the fiber, and all declined. The status quo (largely a single provider per household) has little to do with this.<p>Are you saying we need unbundling because otherwise we won&#x27;t have both fiber internet and low prices? Without the rules regarding ISPs being unable to have ownership over infrastructure they pay 100% of the costs for, fiber could be provided profitably for less than $90/mo. to many portions of Kitsap county.<p>Additionally: There are some households in Kitsap that have never had internet access at all -- surely blaming &quot;the monopoly&quot; is nonsense for those customers, and yet they too are hurt by this local policy.<p>EDIT: I anticipate this being non-productive. Suffice it to say, I&#x27;m not trying to say &quot;Unbundling is not the best policy.&quot; I&#x27;m saying, while we consider this policy, let us understand that it is not a pure, unalloyed good in all situations for all people.

What you&#x27;ve quoted is Larry Rosen&#x27;s view.  Larry is a wonderful guy, but his views are pretty far outside the norm for open source lawyers.<p>To start &quot;If software is licensed under the BSD without forming a contract between licensor and licensee, the extent of any patent grant is at best ambiguous.&quot;<p>This is now settled since he wrote this.
It is in fact a contract, that, if breached, leaves the licensor without a copyright license (causing both infringement of copyright and breach of contract).<p>So you don&#x27;t have to worry about this.<p>The latter is a real issue, but one that most explicit grants don&#x27;t solve either.<p>In particular, apache/et al have explicit grants do <i>not</i> cover modifications by others that suddenly encompass patents.<p>So you aren&#x27;t any better off there either :)",1424988220

9115849,comment,9112305,9115450,0,0,OMGBrewmaster,,,"> I might be missing something here but why is everybody hating on Google for this?<p>I don&#x27;t like this form of paid promotion within Google Play because it means that users will see fewer quality apps in their searches and more expensive apps. It will be harder for users to find enjoyable games and easier for them to find addictive, extortionate games that constantly demand the purchase of gems and coins and other upgrades.  When there exist two applications that perform the same function, paid promotions will ensure that the Google Play user will first see the one that will end up costing him the most, rather than the one that would best serve his purpose.<p>> How is this different from having sponsored results in the search results on Google?<p>Google earns money through sales and in-app purchasing of the apps found on Google Play. This is not true of the web search results found at google.com. Because of this, it serves Google&#x27;s interests to direct Google Play users to apps that extract more money, whereas with Google Search, Google is motivated to return the most relevant possible links.<p>> 1. This allows apps which are new to not just rely on something unreliable as App store optimization to get downloads.<p>This will make it harder for new apps and new developers to be discovered, not easier. Everyone can compete in the app store optimization arena equally by researching and changing keywords and descriptions in their app copy. However only apps that have an average per-user revenue that exceeds the promotional placement price will be able to justify competing with these paid promotional placements.<p>> 2. This will force app developers to think about monetization more seriously and possibly even get rid of free apps culture.<p>Yes, this will encourage developers to work harder to monetize their users. I would prefer if developers were motivated to work harder to please their users instead.<p>> 3. You can get users at the point of their query. Facebook gets you passive users. For example on FB you might need to reach 100 people to find one person who has a problem solved by your app, but using this you can find the exact people looking for apps which solve the problem your app is about.<p>Yes, this makes it more efficient for developers to purchase users. Being bought and sold more easily is bad for the users. From the user&#x27;s perspective, it would be better to have an honest response from a Google Play search. One that finds them the app that best suits their purpose as effectively as Google Search finds them useful web pages.<p>> 4. The argument about Zynga and King owning the sponsored are false. It is like saying Microsoft, Twitter and Facebook are going to own the search results on Google.<p>Zynga and King.com buy an incredible amount of advertising space. They will certainly take advantage of this promotional opportunity, but it isn&#x27;t these two companies that will dominate all search results. In every niche in both games and applications there will be some app whose developer has figured out the best way to prey on human psychology by withholding features, ransoming data or peddling in-game content to maximize revenue from each download. With paid promotional placements, those apps will be each dominate over apps that are designed to be the most useful or entertaining.<p>>5. Improvement in organic search doesn&#x27;t need to happen without starting sponsored results.<p>No, but with promotional placements Google will be motivated to make the organic search results less relevant. Google profits more when their ads are clicks and when the more expensive apps are installed.<p>With promotional placement in the Google Play search results, Google is double-dipping from the app economy by charging 30% from app sales plus charging developers to even make those sales in the first place. Since Google gets to chose the outcome of searches in their app store, they will be doubly motivated to disregard app quality and rank the long-term priciest apps most highly.",1424988012

Could it just be a shim that pulls a more complex program from the net?<p>The judge can disconnect his computer from the Internet, attempt to run the submitted decompressor and file, and declare failure when it doesn&#x27;t work. Nothing in the challenge guarantees Internet connectivity on the machine.<p>> Does a decompressor that depends on linked libraries count? Do things like libc count towards the total decompressor size?<p>Nope. In the email exchange, Mike said that just a script that called out to gunzip would be fine, and that he&#x27;d only count the size of the script as the decompressor size<p>> Where do you draw the line? Can any decompression code call an external dependency and not be disqualified in the same way?<p>Yup, as long as the dependency is already on the machine I suppose.<p>That&#x27;s what&#x27;s so enlightening about this challenge. Even a tiny, tiny script that calls to other programs still can&#x27;t compress a &quot;pathologically&quot; random file by more than a few bytes.",1425797992

This has been recognized going back to Adam Smith if not before, quote from <i>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</i> below.<p>Second:  the &quot;right&quot; to a job (or not) exists (or doesn&#x27;t) because that&#x27;s how the relationship&#x27;s been defined in law.  Law to which, again, employers have an unequal access vis a vis employees.  And such relationships <i>aren&#x27;t</i> recognized in other contexts.  If you bring a child into the world, you cannot shirk your obligations to that child (unless you ensure, through adoption, etc., that they&#x27;re otherwise met).  It&#x27;s quite possible to envision a regime in which employers <i>do</i> assume a responsibility for their employees.<p>On Smith:<p>&quot;What are the common wages of labour, depends everywhere upon the contract usually made between those two parties, whose interests are by no means the same. The workmen desire to get as much, the masters to give as little, as possible. The former are disposed to combine in order to raise, the latter in order to lower, the wages of labour.<p>&quot;It is not, however, difficult to foresee <i>which of the two parties must, upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage</i> in the dispute, <i>and force the other into a compliance</i> with their terms. <i>The masters, being fewer in number, can combine much more easily: and the law, besides, authorises, or at least does not prohibit, their combinations, while it prohibits those of the workmen.</i> We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work, but many against combining to raise it. In all such disputes, the masters can hold out much longer. A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, or merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks, which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year, without employment. In the long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him; but the necessity is not so immediate.<p>&quot;We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of workmen. <i>But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform, combination, not to raise the wages of labour above their actual rate.</i> To violate this combination is everywhere a most unpopular action, and a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbours and equals.&quot;<p>Book I, Chapter IV, &quot;Of the Wages of Labour&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3300"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3300</a>",1425796111

Your argument is that Mike agreed that multiple files could be submitted, and from that you&#x27;re drawing the <i>completely baseless</i> conclusion that the multiple files would be considered purely based on their filesize. According to a straightforward reading of the challenge, only the filesize of the decompressor and compressed file would matter. But when Mike agreed to multiple compressed files, nowhere did anyone state that only the filesize of the additional compressed files would matter.<p>And it should be pretty obvious to anyone that you <i>cannot</i> simply accept just the filesize of the multiple compressed files. Because the <i>only</i> point in using multiple files is to try and hide extra data in either the number of files or their filenames. And that obviously violates the entire point of the challenge.<p>If you want to take Patrick&#x27;s multiple files approach to its logical conclusion, you may as well submit a bunch of zero-sized files where all of the data is stored in the filename (perhaps with an integral prefix for sorting purposes) and have your decompressor just be some variant on `echo` that strips the prefix and echoes the rest of the filename (without space separation). That way you could claim infinite compression!<p>---<p>If you&#x27;re still not convinced, then how about this: nowhere did Mike agree that he would not rename the decompressor or compressed file(s) prior to running the program.

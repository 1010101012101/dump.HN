10586548,comment,10580952,10585260,0,0,gd1,,,"The problem with a FTT is that it is a cascading tax.  Whereas a VAT or GST is charged only on the difference between input and output. I buy some wood for $10, make a table, sell it for $15, GST/VAT is 10%, so I pay out $1 buying the wood, and collect $1.50 selling the table.  I only have to forward the difference, 50c, to the government.<p>With an FTT, that &#x27;tiny&#x27; tax is charged indiscriminately all the way through the chain.  And passed through the chain to the end consumer.  So the market maker pays it twice (in and out of a position) and their margins are razor thin.  So spreads will increase by twice the tax for starters.  Plus you as end consumer will pay it twice (on buying and selling).  So at a bare minimum that 0.1% will be 0.4% for an end consumer.  More if more middlemen are involved in the chain, since it just compounds.  What are annual returns? 4-8%?  So we&#x27;re talking about the government taking 5-10% of your profits?  Does it seem tiny still?",1447833533

10586541,comment,10575458,10586325,0,0,Karellen,,,"To stretch your analogy to breaking point, the explanation that makes the most (least?) sense to me that I&#x27;ve read is thus: First, imagine all the coins have no mass. And a mischevious quantum cat either puts all the copper and sliver coins in the same bag leaving the other empty, or puts all the copper coins in one bag and the silver in the other.<p>Not knowing which placement has been done, you put one bag in your freezer, and drive across town with the other bag.<p>Then you ask yourself the question, or perform an experiment to tell you, &quot;Which bag did the cat put all the coins in?&quot;, at which point you open the bag and find it full of coins or empty, determining the state of the bag you have, and the state of the bag in your freezer at home.<p>No problem, huh?<p>Except, if you&#x27;d asked a different question, or performed a different experiment, to tell you &quot;Which bag contains all the copper coins, and which contains the silver coins?&quot; - <i>you would have still got a valid response</i>, and found the bag either full of copper or silver coins, again determining the state of the other bag at home.<p>That&#x27;s the nature of entanglement. Without knowing the state, the nature of the question you ask of one particle will determine what sort of answer you get, in a way that instantaneously affects the bag at home too. i.e. someone opening your freezer just after you ask your question will see the other bag in a consistent state with the bag you have.<p>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so gorram weird.",1447833473
10586540,comment,10576473,10586164,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The main reason is so you can statically analyze the template source code.  For example, pair Gumbo [1] with an HTML-based templating language and you can identify every image referenced in the HTML and automatically coalesce them into a sprite sheet.  You can replace dynamically-generated images with data: URLs and load the data at the end of the page, minimizing latency.  You can validate your templates to make sure they never generate invalid HTML.  You can run any inline scripts found through Closure Compiler or Babel to minify them (or, in Babel&#x27;s case, support ES6 directly in templates).  You can do CSS renaming automatically on all elements.<p>A secondary reason is to constrain your users so they don&#x27;t end up writing constructs that will be impossible to manipulate with tooling.  Early in Bazel&#x27;s [2] history at Google, BUILD files were just ordinary Python, and you could use any Python code you wanted, and all that mattered were the calls you made into the build rules.  This worked great, with people writing all sorts of list comprehensions and conditionals to minimize code duplication.  And then tools came out to reformat BUILD files, and automatically query for dependencies, and detect dead binaries, and all sorts of other cool stuff.  The tools were a lot more useful than the ability to include arbitrary code, but (because of the halting problem) they would choke whenever they encountered arbitrary flow constructs.  So now arbitrary code is limited to the portions of the build system that explicitly allow it.<p>The EDSL approach (where you just use a regular programming language and a bunch of calls into the engine) <i>can</i> be a good idea, but you give up a lot in tooling.  Usually it&#x27;s most useful in the early stages of a project, where you don&#x27;t have manpower to write the tooling anyway, and then becomes a legacy hassle as you assign more engineers, write more code, and get more leverage from writing tools.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://bazel.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bazel.io/</a>",1447833408

All Christian churches expect the <i>eventual</i> return of Jesus, not His imminent return.  There&#x27;s a big, big difference.<p>> the reason that Catholics and most of the other Christian churches switched to Sunday<p>Well, the early Christians did it ostensibly because Jesus was crucified on a Sunday.  But the real reason was to distinguish themselves from Judaism.  And by the time there were &quot;other&quot; Christian churches the tradition had already been established for 1500 years or so.<p>> Once again, FUD.<p>No, these are salient issues for a presidential candidate.  Someone who believes in the <i>imminent</i> return of Jesus is going to have a very different approach to long-term problems like climate change than someone who thinks Jesus may not be coming back for a long, long time (or at all).  And someone who believes in the inerrancy of the Bible over science is going to have a very different approach to, well, just about everything.<p>7DA is a fundamentalist, apocalyptic religion.  It&#x27;s fundamentalist because they believe in Biblical inerrancy (that&#x27;s what fundamentalist <i>means</i>) and it&#x27;s apocalyptic because they believe Jesus is coming Real Soon Now.

Someone out there could produce our top end model for the low end price.&quot; It logically follows that maybe I should start looking into other manufacturers who sell at closer to manufacturing cost, like Everlast.<p>I realize that big welding shops aren&#x27;t going to drop the big two (Lincoln and Miller) overnight, but I think practices like this are really going to hasten the rise of Chinese upstarts making high quality IGBT welders. Once they (or a third party) starts offering good support and warranty guarantees it&#x27;s going to be hard to compete with them when you employ sales practices like this.<p>For example, the Miller Syncrowave 210 shown in the video is $2,700, base price. I use one weekly, and it&#x27;s a decent welder. Alternatively, one could get an Everlast PowerTig 250EX for $1,700 that comes with features missing from the Miller at a price that&#x27;s $1,000 less.

This paper refers to a slightly older architecture - &quot;Knight&#x27;s Corner&quot;, but it should be roughly the same. Essentially, it has a large number of x86 cores with 4 in-order threads per core. Each core has a 512 KB L2 cache and the entire coprocessor is cache-coherent through a high-speed ring bus. There is also some quantity of GDDR5 (up to 8GB) on said ring bus. The great advantage over Xeon is its scaling to very high levels of parallelism: though threads on the same core will benefit from data locality, the architecture scales uniformly with more cores unlike a NUMA multi-socket setup. There&#x27;s more information about the sorts of optimisations required to get good performance in the paper, but they&#x27;re much the same sort of things as for Xeon. Also, according to the paper, any algorithm well suited for a GPU is well suited to the Phi architecture, though the Phi architecture is far more general-purpose in its applications.<p>[0] - <a href=""https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/article/330164/an-overview-of-programming-for-intel-xeon-processors-and-intel-xeon-phi-coprocessors_1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/article/33016...</a>",1447831603

These results support the hypothesis that the consumption of cooked meat provides an energetic benefit over the consumption of raw meat.&quot;<p>For another example, see <a href=""http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2011/12/08/why-calorie-counts-are-wrong-cooked-food-provides-a-lot-more-energy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2011/12/08/why-calori...</a> :<p>> Half the time the sweet potato or meat was presented raw, and half the time cooked; half the time it was also pounded and half the time unpounded. ... For both meat and sweet potato, Rachel found that when the food was cooked the mice gained more weight (or lost less weight) than when it was raw. Pounding had very little effect.<p>> We suspect that there are two major reasons for cooked beef providing more calories than raw beef. In cooked beef, the muscle proteins, like the sugars in cooked starch, have opened up and allowed digestive enzymes to attack their amino acid chains. Cooking also does this for collagen, a protein that makes meat difficult to chew because it forms the connective tissue wrapped around muscle fibers. However, we do not know the exact mechanisms.<p>Neither mention killing off bacteria, which makes sense as 1) meat doesn&#x27;t enter the bloodstream but only its digestive products, and 2) stomach acids kill most of the bacteria.<p>That second paper is <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/108/48/19199.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/108/48/19199.abstract</a> .<p>> The positive energetic effects of cooking were found to be superior to the effects of pounding in both meat and starch-rich tubers, a conclusion further supported by food preferences in fasted animals. Our results indicate significant contributions from cooking to both modern and ancestral human energy budgets. They also illuminate a weakness in current food labeling practices, which systematically overestimate the caloric potential of poorly processed foods.",1447830827

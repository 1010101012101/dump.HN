It's been a staple of American political analysis for decades that although poor <i>states</i> tend to vote Republican, poor <i>people</i> tend vote Democratic.  If you take Mississippi, you will find that it is poor and thus (as expected) it votes Republican.  But <i>within</i> Mississippi the poorest groups overwhelmingly vote Democratic (regardless of skin colour, in case you think racism plays a role), while the richest groups vote Republican.  Look at a rich state and the same trends hold - the poorest groups within that state will vote Democratic, while the richest will vote Republican.  (A ton of research exists on this; this blog post seems to sumarrise it well[2].)<p>To quote from the article: ""So Romney appears to be wrong about these voters. But if calling for a less progressive taxation system was enough to alienate poor voters in the Deep South, the Republican Party would have already lost its stronghold there.""  This is something that could only be written by someone who has no grasp of American politics.<p>You only have to glance at an exit poll - <i>any</i> exit poll - to realize that Republicans alienated poor voters <i>LOOOONG</i> ago.  Let's say 2004, presidential election, Mississippi again[3]:  Kerry beat Bush by 24 points among people making less than $15k a year, but by only 9 points among people making $15k - $30k.  Look at people making $30k - $50k and he lost by 20 points, a massive 36 points among people making $50k - $75k, and an eye-popping 43% (71% to 28%) among people making over $75k.  And, again, the same trends exert themselves in every state, every race, and every year, over and over and over.  Texas in 2004?  Kerry wins every income band up to $30k, and loses everything else by increasing landslides (losing 92% to 8% for people making over $200k).  California in 2004?  Same deal; Kerry wins every income band up to $100k, and loses everything else by ever-increasing margins as you climb the income scale.  Congressional elections in 2010?  Same thing: [4]<p>TL;DR:  Today I learned that you don't need to have a good grasp of statistics, logic, or American politics to be an associate editor of <i>The Atlantic</i>.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_paradox</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://super-economy.blogspot.co.nz/2011/04/red-state-rising.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://super-economy.blogspot.co.nz/2011/04/red-state-rising...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/MS/P/00/epolls.0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/MS...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JGX1ch5CkN8/TZ9mEU7lnJI/AAAAAAAAAeU/KIF8RJuRY0g/s1600/cnn.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JGX1ch5CkN8/TZ9mEU7lnJI/AAAAAAAAAe...</a>",1347937178

In this case if you need to aggregate the count of something then in a DB like MySQL you can lean on the index to get a quick count, but if you need to SUM or AVG you will be doing just as much CPU level work as a NoSQL solution. The difference is in MySQL its a simple query with the AVG operator, in MongoDB its a Map-Reduce query which is much harder to write.<p>In general you need to know what your doing under the hood and how either solution effects your problem domain. Where I work we need to aggregate billions of data points on demand. This can't be done in real time without pre-aggregating the results ( and even then it takes tons of I/O just to process the aggregated data set )",1347937109

If it were True, that would also mean you couldn't use parentheses to set the order of operations, since items inside parentheses would be tuples. That would be nuts.<p>IMO this is just an educational issue where people aren't taught that the comma is the tuple operator (e.g. `x = 3,4` is perfectly legal) and parentheses just come along for the ride to disambiguate other uses of commas. If I were king tuples wouldn't have the same syntax as argument lists (`f((3,2))` is pretty ugly), but both Python tuples and Python argument lists conform to a lot of people's expectations of how both those things should look.<p>The fact that duck typing makes tuples and literals (temporarily) indistinguishable to the interpreter is more of a rough edge of duck typing itself.

Sure, the new consumer wins - but at the cost of destroying a societal norm.  The new entrant might gain short-term profits but at the expense of their long term market and possibly their very existence.<p>The opportunities for diamond arbitrage are very small, both because there aren't large organised exchanges (no diamond futures contract I'm aware of) and because the retail market is controlled by the suppliers, removing the possibility of 'black market' arbitrage.<p>Many, many companies would love to exert control over their market in the same way.

Square showed off the increasing real business viability by making payments accessible to anyone with a phone. All these apps weren't available on Android for some time. Sure they are now but this far more a matter of increasing market share than a change of opinions and it continues to hold true as we see well-designed apps like Paper start iOS only. Android is by no means the epicenter of creativity on mobile and though beautiful, the ports largely still have substandard experiences than their iOS counterparts.<p>In my opinion this is a result of equal parts hardware and audience. Android may be on more devices as a whole but many of the devices are not even remotely competitive with top-tier smartphones. They are sold with the intention of being budget friendly and thus it becomes a hassle to acquire the additional devices, adapt interfaces to the numerous screen sizes on them, and adjust for performance limitations. I also believe that the design of the iPhone naturally attracts great designers. Android has a reputation of throwing good hardware into poorly designed phones with cheap materials and inferior build quality - the future is just not as cool when you need to interact with plastic buttons. Lastly, I believe the iPhone audience is naturally more in tune to seek out great designed products. The openness that appeals to Android customers creates an expectation that applications should be free. There is a decreased interest in browsing the marketplace and many of the most popular apps are just free copycats of popular iPhone applications.",1347935419

But - for reasons outlined in the article - the intrinsic linking of diamonds to the act of romance and marriage is well embedded in society.  So even if people know it is essentially meaningless (in the true sense of rarity) as far as society goes, they have a social status.<p>Any society is full of irrational practices and purchases.  Throwing rice at a wedding?  What's that about?   $5 cards to wish someone well?  What on earth?   Yet these are all accepted by society as societal norms, and even when the companies have conspired to create them (or at least magnify their importance) it is what it is.  In a form of social proof, nobody wants to be the first to break with the tradition, which is how most tradition stays.  Same goes for Christmas - which is nominally a Christian religious festival, but, at least in the USA, widely adopted by people of all religious and aetheist beliefs. Because nobody wants to be the grouch who doesn't hand out presents.<p>Interestingly the article mentions the introduction of Argyle diamonds - a friend of mine, while travelling in remote WA bought a large diamond at a fraction of the retail cost, direct from either the mine itself or a local retailer.  He kept this for 15 years, which was the time period between purchase and eventually finding someone to marry (and getting it put into a ring).<p>But as to why the introduction of new sources hasn't drastically affected prices, I think that any new cartel or operator entering the market is just as likely to free-ride the hard work of De Beers.

Executive decisions were made, but without a corporate officer to direct liability to, things were very ""sketchy"". Eventually it got so bad the investors decided to sell the company off and recoup what they could, but needed the CEO to stay on for some legal reasons -- they gave him no pay, he provided no interaction with anybody in the company. It was beyond unpleasant.<p>Talking with him later on he admitted he was embarrassed things had gone the way they did, but justified his behavior that half pay means half time and no pay means no time.

On PostgreSQL you usually get a major performance benefit out of indexing columns only as needed later.  This is because of internal design differences, sequential scans through a table are <i>much</i> cheaper on PostgreSQL (in MySQL it has to scan a table in key order, not physical order which means no OS prefetch).  Also non-PK index scans are faster on PostgreSQL though PK index scans are slightly faster on InnoDB (basically the table is contained in the Primary Key index there).<p><i>Contrast the fairly easy and routine process of migrating between MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server with the huge amount of work involved changing your application code from MongoDB to anything else.</i><p>So suppose I want to move my database which uses PostGIS and pgcrypto to MySQL or SQL Server.

4535934,comment,4535611,4535611,27,0,jonnathanson,,,"It's a fascinating piece, for a number of reasons. The first, and perhaps most interesting, is that the story behind the De Beers cartel is <i>well known</i>. Perhaps not in this depth, but still, it's no secret. Pretty much everyone knows they exercise a monopoly on diamond production and distribution, artificially keeping prices high. And yet, nobody takes the red pill and opts out of the illusion. Call it the power of the diamond industry's marketing. Call it adherence to tradition (created by the diamond industry's marketing). Call it what you will. But it's a powerful force. Consumers know it's a lie, and they choose to live the lie.<p>Second: a major prediction made in this article <i>did</i> come to pass, but it didn't have the predicted effect on diamond pricing. A serious contender to De Beers emerged in the early 2000s in the form of a multinational, ""breakaway"" cartel. Yet, both cartels -- and all other minor, independent players in the market -- seem to be acting in concert to keep supplies artificially low, and prices artificially high. In fact, the rate of price increase is at its highest in modern history. Economics tells us that this shouldn't be the case, especially given the emergence of new market entrants. And yet, the rate of price increase took off at <i>precisely the same moment</i> as the entrance of the new competitors. (Source: <a href=""http://www.ajediam.com/investing_diamonds_investment.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ajediam.com/investing_diamonds_investment.html</a>)<p>What could be causing a major, year-over-year price increase in the face of new competition? Well, one guess would be that the two cartels are colluding in some way. Perhaps they've made an arrangement to fix prices or production. Or perhaps they've carved up the map, and reached some sort of non-competition agreement in each other's territories. Perhaps both. Ordinarily I'd call these ideas paranoid. But the history of the diamond business tells me that we can't put it past these guys.",1347934367

I do think it is sound advice to push the relational database model (this overlaps but is not identical to the relational algebra model) to the breaking point before going elsewhere.  If you don't do data validation you can't do ad hoc data transformation later reliably.  Strict schemas are always an investment in the future for that reason.<p>> <i>Polymorphic structures are a PITA to model in relational tables, but they fit very well in schemaless, document-oriented NoSQL systems. This has nothing to do with data validation.</i><p>JSON and XML types in PostgreSQL rock.  If you can limit the areas where the data is polymorphic, you can push the rest into those types.  Many other RDBMS's support XML types as well.<p>> <i>Rapidly changing schemas are a PITA in RDBMSes, especially with a large cluster of servers.

You are allowing old schema and new schema to co-exist.  How many old schemas does your application have to support?  It seems to me this would likely ossify things down the road a bit because if your schema is that rapidly changing, you may never get caught up and so backward compatibility is going to be a bitch.

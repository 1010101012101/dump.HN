214215,comment,214146,214146,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Post-humans are showing up all the time. I intend to evolve again on July 11, when I get equipped with my connection to the hive mind... er, I mean my always-on Wikipedia appliance, courtesy of Apple.<p>Admittedly, it won't be that impressive. If I could somehow take my iPhone back in time (with a trans-temporal wireless network connection, of course) to play Trivial Pursuit against my high-school-aged self, then it would be obvious how different my augmented self is from my prior self. (And equally obvious that skill at Trivial Pursuit, which used to be considered akin to being smart, is now an oddball exercise, like building furniture using nothing but a jackknife, or starting a fire without matches. We don't have to pursue trivia anymore. We caught it. It's sitting here in this box.)<p>But, as it happens, I'm actually late to the iPhone party, and when I get one nobody will care. It is as Bruce Sterling said: ""the Singularity is banal"". Post-singular creatures won't be all that impressed with themselves, just as the first human to utter a grammatical sentence didn't really stop to marvel at it. She was probably too busy trying to get her friend to pass her a handful of walnuts.",1213127900

The central theme of REST is  that a single URI corresponds uniquely to a single ""thing"", which is then operated on using a small set of operations (basically set/get/delete).<p>That's great, if your problem works like that.  It's not great if it doesn't.  Some protocols really are more appropriately modelled using ""methods"" on the objects, because the behavior is what matters, not so much the data itself.",1213127573

RIM is coming with new models (this summer) - which may surprisingly come with amazing features. Also their new product cycle is getting shorter and shorter with new design and easy usability.<p>5. lack of physical keyboard is a topic of concern for power users - executives dont have time to learn new way of typing.<p>6. RIM has a huge market share due to its availability with multiple service providers - apple's biggest weakness is its exclusivity with at&t and this may make them to regret in long term.<p>7. RIM may surprise everyone by having some exclusive tie-up with service providers, for example free VOIP calls within north america - they will still make money out of data plans though but something like this will have huge impact on competitors business models.<p>Conclusion:  Don Reisinger, STOP dreaming !",1213127164

Once you get the company started and start to need to put more and more time into it, then you can quit your main job (or have a spouse/relative support you). In either case you need to eat, and you don't want to end up in a situation where your startup failed (hey it happens) and you are in heavy debt unable to pay it off.<p>If you like your job, stick with it, if they can teach you something. Really good specially fresh out of school.<p>Regarding money, from people I know who started businesses, they all say the same thing: It takes time for it to actually start EARNING money, at first you keep investing and investing and investing.

214196,comment,213421,213550,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Actually, I vaguely remember reading about a study of bards which showed that -- surprise, surprise -- thousand-line epic poems <i>aren't</i> memorized word-for-word. Certain famous lines are memorized, the overall plot is memorized, the meter may or may not be fixed... but a bunch of the details end up being improvised. Fans of folk music or jazz should be completely unsurprised by this.<p>The moral of this story is that the identity and talent of the person ""transcribing"" an epic poem into print -- or playing that folk music into the recorder -- are really important.<p>Of course, perhaps a dedicated critic of writing would laugh at the absurd notion that an epic poem whose words <i>were exactly the same at every performance</i> was somehow ""more correct"". Why, if you standardize the words, the art is gone! That's the approach taken by dedicated fans of concert music and jazz: it's the little differences in interpretation and approach that make each performance fresh and unique.",1213126417

On a much larger scale, I can't say what this will do to submissions; it's possible someone will post a completely appropriate blog entry that's more of an editorial than a report or product review, only to end up receiving numerous downvotes because of a differing opinion.<p>But I'm with everyone else when I say to give it a trial period and see how it goes.

It was a part-time effort the whole time-- never made it to FT before we sold.<p>Part-time is a great way to run an experiment-- if it's a simple one.  There are lots of great startups that start as weekend projects-- but obviously if you bite off a HUGE project, part time just won't play.<p>If you can set aside 1-2 nights a week (and 1 weekend day per week) to crank away for 6 weeks and release something decent, I say stick part-time and give it a whirl.  If the project is more complex than that or you can't set aside that time (for you and your partner), then momentum will probably get to be a problem.<p>But, generally-- fulltime wins.",1213126090

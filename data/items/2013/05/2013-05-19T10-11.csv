5732510,comment,5731693,5731693,0,0,primitur,,,"I think nuclear power has a long way to go before it will ever become non-useful to the species, which is to say I'm pro nuclear-power, generally.  I think its better for the Earth that we localize massive power generation around a relatively small area, rather than systemetize energy transfer into, almost, everything we do with Oil, for example.  Transferring energy instead of making it and using it where its needed, seems to be one way we can reduce the overall footprint as quickly as possible.  Nuclear power requires not nearly as much massive support infrastructure as coal and oil, I feel.  Sure: quite some, but with micro-reactors on the horizon, this may also miniaturize.<p>But what I really think is we should be focussing the effort on local energy need, far more seriously.  Like, establish real neighborhood energy systems that use the energy that is in the neighborhood - if its solar, solar.  If it is thermal: thermal.  If it is wind: wind.  If there are none of the above sources available for your house: MOVE!<p>All of the tech exists for an average house-hold to step off the grid, and it really is mostly a matter of minds being changed about the 'culturally acceptable reality' of how we manage our energy-driven lifestyles.<p>I, for one, welcome the day when I can compute without having to ever once plug my laptop in, because its case is in fact no longer a dull grey oil-debt, but rather instead a highly efficient solar panel, and I look forward to using a 'slow system' if the CPU itself has evolved into an extremely lean - yet fully functional - current sink that gets along with whatever sunshine is available.  I yearn for a complete dirth of chemical-derived power for my computing needs.<p>Hopefully, the day will come when stepping off the Grid is as easy as, once, the revolution that occurred when millions of us were suddenly able to carry around 20,000 songs in our pocket, access any knowledge, anywhere, and talk to anyone we chose to, any time, at a flick of a swish ..",1368960913

As a total non-Web developer, who nonetheless is forced to put together internal web apps from time to time, dojo just seems to get the job done.<p>I use dojo layouts a lot, as i could not code the necessary css in a million years. Yes it cheats and uses Javascript to resize components, something that apparently makes Web purists cry, but for me it was just another quick solution that worked.<p>Similarly dojo 2d charts -- there may be better solutions out there, but with dojo they are built in and just work for the most part.<p>I think the Ajax model works pretty well, although the whole promises/futures took a bit to get used to.<p>There its definitely a learning curve, and if i just wanted a bit of dom manipulation i would probably still just use jquery-- but i found dojo to be invaluable when it came to developing more complex client side apps that could make use of a batteries included framework.<p>Things i didn't like - a lot of the documentation seemed to relate to a prior version (i started with 1.8 i think), so finding the appropriate way to do something could take a bit of work. Also debugging was often difficult, as the error was often raised in some anonymous function created deep within dojo. Sometimes the stack traces were useful, sometimes not.",1368960908

He'd never need an individual pest control plan but if it was a small add-on to an existing bundle...) As well as outsourcing a large part of your sales effort you also reach homeowners with low risks of infestations who wouldn't contract individually with an independent pest control contractor: rates would be lower but so would the actuarial risk.<p>(ii) go direct to the general home insurance companies - dealing with you direct is more efficient for them than rebating their policyholders for pest control contractors they've called out.

Haskell doesn't have a null value that we could use here. There is such a function defined in the standard library, but it is partial. It uses error in the Nothing case.<p>edit:
In many cases there is a clear value that should be used in the Nothing case, suppose you have a Maybe Int which is the number of times a specific event happened in the last second. Clearly 0 is a good default and you can write a function (Maybe Int -> Int). There's a function I tend to use for such cases: (maybe :: b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b).

5732436,comment,5731164,5732371,2,0,DanWaterworth,,,"> at least half of what you have written above is completely wrong.<p>That's quite an assertion.<p>> Scala has side effects everywhere, yet the Monad is extensively used in Scala programs. Monads have nothing to do with ""effects"".<p>I didn't say monads weren't used outside of Haskell, I say that they are less useful. I haven't programmed in Scala before, I assume monads are used for their notation. They aren't required.<p>> Monads are not used to decide the kind of ""effects"" you are allowed. By calling every Monad a kind of ""effect"", you are just begging the question. Monads are merely objects that follow 3 monad laws, no more no less.<p>I don't know if you're familiar with group theory, but in group theory, every finite group is a specialization of the group of permutations. Groups are defined abstractly by the operations that they allow in the same way that monads are, but this definition for finite groups is as general as saying that every group is a subgroup of the group of permutations.<p>It's the same for monads, they are defined abstractly, but the abstract definition is equivalent to saying monads are all of the things that you can create by a specific kind of specialization of the continuation monad.<p>Continuations are an effect. Specializations of continuations are also effects. Monads define effects. What's really interesting is thinking about monads in terms of the Curry-Howard Isomorphism, on one end of the scale, the identity monad, you have constructive logic and at the other end, continuations, you have classical logic, what's in the middle? Does the list monad instance have an interesting associated logic?<p>Which question am I begging?<p>> How is this different from a C program?<p>It's just a different way of looking at programs. The distinction is never drawn for C programs.<p>> Haskell is pure in the presence of IO, because the type system tracks IO calls and forces any function that even indirectly refers to a quantity obtained via IO to modify its type signature to reflect the IO action.<p>This is quite a shallow way of looking at it.<p>> This can be done with/without Monads.<p>Sure, you could use continuations or uniqueness types.<p>> Haskell IO is a Monad, because it pretty much analogous to the State Monad<p>AFAIK, that's not defined in the Haskell standard, but that is the way that GHC does it.<p>> Haskell has special Monad syntax that lets you pass the World State implicitly and write imperative code in an imperative style.<p>No, it's not syntax that's letting you pass the world state implicitly. In GHC:<p><pre><code>    IO x = State RealWorld x = (RealWorld -> (RealWorld, x))
</code></pre>
You can't get at this function and RealWorld doesn't have any constructors, so you can't call an IO operation or do other weird things. Anyway, it doesn't really matter how IO is actually defined. What matters is it's interface.",1368958548

1185353,comment,1184698,1185253,0,0,bobbin,,,"I'll write a piece of an answer I gave to another person:<p>> Lets say we want quality control in dentistry. You like the government quality control the government gives and would like your dentists to count with their approval. I, on the other hand, think it's requirements are excessive. Most of what my dentist does is find black spots in my teeth, drill them out, and then fill the hole. This does not require 4 years of study. If I ever get to need a root canal I would need someone with more studies but until then I'd me happy with someone with less studies, maybe a certification given by the manufacturer of the equipment, I don't know.<p>If you like the government certification you can limit yourself only to government certificated doctors. No problem.
A group of people should be able do give public approval of university courses and degrees. If you like the government that OK.<p>I'm just object locking people in cages when they don't comply with these regulations. The violent monopoly is the problem.<p>>  But the article is dead wrong in concluding that we're better off removing all licensing requirements.<p>The key word here is <i>requirements</i>. Not removing all licensing. The distinction is not expressed clearly. If you don't comply with the ""required"" licensing they lock you in jail, or the demand money from you, and if you don't comply, then you go to jail.",1268351982

Solve that problem (with a gps device that 'dings' when I need to get off, or the like.)  and you don't need to build more infrastructure.<p>Personally, if I can ride the train (caltrain here in the south bay, or BART in the rest of the bay area)  it's pretty good.  I work rather than paying attention to driving.  the bus is right out, not because of the poverty, but because I have to pay attention, else I end up at the wrong stop.<p>The thing is, on the train, I'm working.  I've got one of those cellular modems in my laptop, so really I don't mind that it often takes longer than driving.  In fact, I'd prefer to remove the complex 'express' schedules, as it's difficult to figure out what train you need to be on.  (the shitty PA speaker is hard to understand, even when the conductor gives you clear instructions, which isn't often)  Also, often in many trains it is difficult to tell which train you are in from inside the train, and the number on the cab flashes by quickly.",1268351863

In the case of the pet thing, making owners get a license and pass a test and pay for insurance, etc. is all there to protect <i>others</i> from your potentially dangerous pet. The same is true of all the TSA rules - they are justified under the guise of keeping people safe from each other.<p>You can't use such a simple-sounding argument to counter anything because it can be used just as well to justify the stupid stuff in the first place. What's needed is good old fashioned human judgement - but that's no longer allowed.

I self-funded my PhD through fellowships and work, which gave me freedom to work on any problem I wanted. That taught me self-reliance and the power of creativity, not just technical skill and process. That is something I don't think my counterparts who were supported by grants grasped very well. During my time as a professor, I tried to give my own PhD students the same freedom.<p>I agree that having good discoveries and novel algorithms should be a good way to get a paper published. I respectfully disagree that the process isn't ""cargo cult"", though. In practice, it tends to be more often than not. 
The research culture rewards quantity over quality, and most papers are rubbish. You will hear ""Dr A has B publications"" 100+ times more often than ""Dr C has a few papers that have been cited hundreds of times.""  That's an indicator that our research culture is broken.",1268351332

Since single payer advocates claim at least a 30% savings and that's just a touch over 20%, that per-person savings should be a slam dunk.<p>To sweeten the pot, he can use the money from the per-person cut to increase the number of people covered.

Yes, he's free to negotiate, remove import restrictions, and the like.  However, he can't force people to accept the prices that he'd like to pay - he can only refuse to do biz with folks who don't charge what he'd like.

It was awful.  I'm no fan of the AMA.  But I like having doctors who know basic anatomy.<p>On all of your reputation issues, people's judgment of the quality of doctors is almost entirely a function of their bedside manner, and not their competence.  If you just go off of reputation, and reputation is based on the decisions of lay people, the result is that competent doctors get bad reputations and confident charlatans get excellent ones.  And health suffers accordingly.<p>A similar well-documented example are public health measures.  My surface impressions of a restaurant are a bad guide for whether the cook washes his hands properly after going to the bathroom.  And dysentery comes through infrequently enough that you won't discover this from your neighbor getting sick until far too late.  But well-constructed licensing requirements solve this problem and save lives.  (In fact there is good data suggesting that public health measures like these save more lives year in and year out than all of the advances of modern medicine.)<p>We also know what happens with public engineering.  Before licensing requirements were created, the USA averaged one random bridge collapse per <i>week</i>.  That's pretty bad.  It gets rapidly worse if you get an earthquake.  I live in an earthquake prone zone, and I am a very firm supporter of having the buildings I am around and in be built to standards created by qualified engineers, then inspected by properly licensed inspectors.  California is among the few areas where significant earthquakes don't tend to come with massive loss of life, and I appreciate that fact.<p>I could multiply examples, but the flip side of the argument does not hold.  The article is correct that there are a lot of stupid licensing requirements out there.  The article is correct that the motivation is often restraint of trade.

I especially admire his courage in promoting a regular expression engine that disregards popular features not found in true regular languages, such as backreferences.<p>That sed, some pedantic gripes:<p>1.  It is not true (or is at least confusingly stated) that searches are linear (per the project page) in space and time in the lengths of the regular expression and the length of the target string.  The simpler and more accurate statement is that searches are (worst case) linear time-wise in the <i>product</i> of the length of regexp and the search string, and O(1) for space.<p>2. Credit where credit is due: the caching-DFA technique was first widely popularized in old editions of the so-called Dragon Book (Aho, Sethi, and Ullman's ""Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools.""  My copy was published in 1985.   In personal correspondence with some old Bell Labs guys, I'm informed that someone (Thompson, as I recall) puzzled out the technique in the 1970s or perhaps the very early 1980s - but set it aside as being too hairy for their needs at the time.  Cox should ask Pike to correct my memory on that.  The technique has been practiced in a number of matchers since that time.  In fact, an O(1) memory DFA caching implementation has been available for more than a decade as free software although its author (uh, me) hastens to add that he has little doubt that Mr. Cox has an implementation with novel charms that was well worth doing.  My implementation got too hairy in some ways.<p>3. Perhaps it will change over time but in this release, at least per the documentation, when the cache of DFA states is filled, the entire cache is discarded.  This nearly needlessly limits the range of applicability of the matcher.  An incremental approach to cache clearing using a (perhaps weighted) LRU strategy would expand the reach of this implementation at relatively little cost.  This is <i>not</i> to say that Mr. Cox made a bad decision taking the simpler approach first (mumble mumble premature optimization mumble evil mumble mumble just constant factors something something something the dark side).<p>4. His inner loop looks like it uses <i>way</i> more instructions than are reasonably called for although, to be sure, to be certain of that I'd have to know what requirements he's constrained to satisfy.   When running out of the DFA cache, my implementation could (at least when last measured) get by on something like 12 or 20 instructions per character in the string being searched.  Perhaps I'm mis-reading the code but this thing looks like it has much higher ""constant factors"".<p>To be clear:  I'm a fan of Mr. Cox's series of articles (written over several years!) about regexps.   I like his general approach so much that I <i>would</i> wish I'd tried it first (except that I did, just wrong place, wrong time).  I think the topic is sufficiently cool that I mention the above pedantic points mainly for the benefit of third parties, to give them some additional entry points to learn about it.  Not trying to damn Mr. Cox at all, yadda yadda.  On the contrary, he seems to have arrived in the weird little regular expression engine zone.  Nice calling card.",1268349154

Both of these are common enough critiques in actual philosophic circles, but depressingly absent from ""internet Objectivism"" (a close cousin of internet libertarianism, another troubled philosophy).",1268348901

I hate this style of straw man argument, for example:<p><i>""We see the same sort of overreaction to paedophilia. Just because one man in your town likes to watch schoolgirls playing netball""</i><p>Well obviously if paedophilia was limited to men like watching schoolgirls play netball, and not to people employed in positions of trust to deal with other people's children abusing them horrifically, then yes, that would be an over-reaction.<p>This kind of cartoon argument also makes it hard to have a real debate on the issue. For example we can legitimately discuss the ""pants bomber"" case - does the fact that one man caught attempting something increase the chances of it being done in the future, or are we like generals always fighting the last war?<p>As to the dog argument I am rather astonished at the hysteria surrounding this pronouncement, given the very high rates of micro-chipping in the UK. And there are a whole number of reasons why dogs should be microchipped for their own welfare.",1268348815

Build a damn app that is worth something. Don't build shit that depends on your users creating accounts anywhere outside your control.<p>Honestly, dislike Apple's guidelines all you like (I dislike plenty of them), but take a page from Apple's book and start to think about your app with the users first--think about how annoying it is to start up an app and then have to go through all the hassle of signing up or logging in with other people's/companies' services <i>just to use your app</i>.<p>Think about your product the way Apple thinks about theirs: depend on yourself as much as possible to deliver an experience you control end-to-end.",1335948383

I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. That government spending is immoral? Yes I doubt he agrees with that premise, but I doubt many people do.<p>> Once the money is gone continue spending with debt, don't worry about interest or inflation, as central bank you can create money out of thin air.<p>Krugman is not calling for unchecked spending, as you appear to be implying. During the bush years, he frequently criticized policies that ran up debt. However, in his view the long term cost of a recession/stagnant economy is much larger that the amount of debt that might be bought to perform quantitative easing, or any other government intervention in times of financial crisis.<p>> Continue ""stimulating"" the economy, raise taxes to 100% or declare bankruptcy of your debt if necessary, inflation does not matter, that people loose all their savings does not matter, that private economy disappears does not matter.<p>Complete hyperbole. Where on earth did you learn about krugman? Because frankly this comment is awful.  You start by calling him a shill, which quite clearly shows your biases, and gives you a reason to dismiss his arguments without giving them proper thought. You then go on to call him not very intelligent which is frankly condescending and very arrogant. And then straight after that you have a sentance that sounds exactly like a libertarian talking point. It has all the markers of being a great political attack: comparison to soviet union, allusions to loss of liberty/totalitarianism, and most of all, factually incorrect.<p>You call him a shill yet you come off as one, and you give no indication that you have ever tried to understand his ideas with an open mind. I do not subscribe to the Randian ideology, yet I can see why a person might. Can you do the same for krugman? When children are young, sometimes they get told to name five good things about a person before they express their dislike for then. Can you do that for krugman?",1335947129

     users can choose Android, which thrives on the
     notion of 'user choice'.
</code></pre>
That's one reason why I, as a consumer, chose Android in the first place.<p>When I decided to buy a smartphone, I wanted one that allowed me to block calls and SMS messages completely, without leaving traces in the calls/sms logs. I wanted this because somehow my number ended up on a lot of spam lists and a smartphone should be smart about these things, right? If my email address is protected by spam filters, it should be a no-brainer for my smartphone to do the same for calls and SMS.<p>Imagine my surprise when I found out that such apps are banned from the iTunes App Store and that the only way to get such functionality on iOS was for me to root it and install software through Cydia. And why should I as a consumer go through so many hoops to use such software, when the company (that receives my money in the process) is actively hostile to my use case, a use case which is in no way immoral or unjustified.<p>When it comes to Android, building an app that blocks calls and SMS messages is still hard, as the APIs you have to rely on are private and keep changing, so the results are unpredictable. But upon a search on Google Play, I did find one that works well, installed with a single click. And I didn't have to root my phone.<p>Now that's what openness gets you - user experience is important, but it's all for nothing if the apps allowed don't solve your real problems.",1335946746

When the results of those queries change, Knockout Meteor will ensure that the associated Observables are updated.<p>Why?<p>Knockout lets you create complex associations between Javascript model data and DOM elements using an expressive and declarative binding syntax. The Knockout Mapping plugin excels at atomically updating your Javascript models (and hence your UI) based on incoming data, updating only that which has changed. These are two strengths that Meteor does not currently possess.<p>Meteor, however, makes it incredibly easy to ferry model data back and forth between a server and its connected clients. Knockout Meteor acts as a bridge between these two frameworks. It lets you construct queries against Meteor Collections that behave like Knockout Observables that update themselves atomically and automatically when the results of those queries change.<p>I look forward to your comments, issues, opinions, and any pull requests you come up with.",1335946571

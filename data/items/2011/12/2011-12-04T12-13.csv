Converting video with ffmpeg is trivial in my experience.  What <i>exactly</i> does zencoder do that's better than anyone else?  Has zencoder actually extended ffmpeg in a deeply meaningful way--e.g. modified the codebase to handle new codecs, new containers, or transcode much, much faster than a basic ffmpeg install? The website is not particularly helpful in that regard and strikes me as a bunch of smoke and mirrors surrounding a pedestrian ffmpeg implementation running in the ""cloud.""<p>In my experience it is far more efficient to transcode very high resolution files (4k or even 1080p) locally, and then upload a real deliverable (at much greater speed now that it has been compressed).",1323003527

Decades ago, in my\n    teens, before I was fortunate enough to snap out of it, such\n    a situation would have produced an *extreme* amount of\n    anxiety. \n\n    I can only feel sorry for anyone who has lived their whole\n    life that way. \n\n    There aren't many ways to help them, everything you say or\n    do is processed via an elaborate shell script that basically\n    amounts to this:\n\n       sed -e 's/outside help/trick of the devel/'\n\n    Poor people, really. If they weren't so dangerous &\n    annoying, we ought to have sympathy for them. It really was\n    a high-stress lifesytle. I'm thankful to have snapped out of\n    it early on, lots of others aren't so lucky. It really is\n    like a trap.\n</code></pre>\nEspecially the bit about ""high-stress lifestyle"". Because really, it's not just about being simply offended by imagery that is perceived as antagonistic to their religion, it's about getting <i>completely worked up</i> over a <i>cartoon</i> image of a devil, and truly believing that whoever put that there must be corrupted by Dark Forces.<p>It's kind of hard to come up with a non-Christian equivalent, maybe something like travelling to Asia, visiting a Hindu temple, and completely freaking out about the swastikas, because obviously this means that all Hindus are in fact Nazis. Or even more direct, refusing to book a hotel owned by Hindus that prominently display some swastika emblem behind the counter (as a good luck/prosperity charm).<p>Now imagine living with this delusion, you actually believe this, everybody trying to convince you otherwise is either sadly misguided, corrupted, or ""one of them"" and these swastikas are quite prevalent in Asia. You'd be living in <i>a constant state of fear of Imaginary Nazis!</i><p>It's one of those things that is both funny and sad and amazing and pitiful, all at the same time.<p>Maybe another comparison, I know a couple of people that can completely freak out from simply seeing a picture of a spider, as much that if it's large and unexpected enough they will actually jump out of their chair and panic. A big difference is of course that these people are aware that their fear is irrational--that a picture cannot hurt them (well, apart from any physical reactions they bring about their own, of course).",1323002587

You'd think 300dpi screens were absolutely everywhere, and that only people still using 100dpi monstrosities were dinosaurs, sticks-in-the-mud, and your technophobic grandmother - all easily ignored! But that appears to be not the case. The majority of screens (probably all of them, pretty much, going by surface area...) seem to still be at the 100-150dpi resolution. Worse, the higher-DPI screens are on things like laptops, phones and tablets - all devices that have a limit on how far away from your eyes you can hold them! End result: grid still very much in evidence.<p>People are so keen to do away with the very idea of the pixel grid, and just pretend it doesn't exist, but the technology to display the result is just not there yet!

In the meantime, there are untapped opportunities for app developers who can make the low-end shine.<p>Tiny displays, traditional keypads and unreliable 2.5G data connections await those app developers who are brave enough to venture into emerging markets...

You can't experiment a lot in a low-level job, but lots of people in the bridge-engineering business wish they had more leeway to experiment with new solutions, even if it wasn't quite at the Frank-Lloyd-Wright or Calatrava level of experimentation. This usually gets blamed on the bifurcation between big-name-architect vs. just-implement-it civil engineer, splitting a role that was more historically integrated between the design/engineering. Also, some blame it on crushing layers of government bureaucracy/regulation.",1323000256

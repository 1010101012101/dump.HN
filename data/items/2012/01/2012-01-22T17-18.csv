This gives an undue amount of influence to a small number of party bigwigs, and the inevitable mess results.<p>As for compulsory voting, at least in Belgium, it has been credited with fuelling the rise of more extreme parties, notably the anti-immigration Flemish nationalists, since people who feel disenfranchised by the whole system tend to cast a protest vote, without seriously considering the consequences. Also, the notion that you could get fined or jailed for not voting seems to me to be as illiberal an idea as ACTA or the Patriot act.",1327254975

People that did not have a choice about which family they are born into.<p>Consider my own personal story. I come from an upper-middle class family. During high school I wasn't particularly motivated to excel academically and as a consequence didn't get particularly good grades in courses that I should have if I had invested the appropriate time and effort into studying. My parents response to this situation was to hire a tutor and force me to sit down with said tutor and study several hours a week. As a consequence I ended up getting better grades than I should have simply because my parents had the disposable income to spend on tutors. People from disadvantaged backgrounds do not get this same benefit. As a consequence I go on to university and end up getting a higher position on the totem pole because of my parents wealth. The kid who comes from a disadvantaged background and is in the same academic position as me does not get that kind of second chance.<p>>The next closest ""fair"" thing to me is a retail sales tax, provided that everyone is provided a stipend to cover the tax paid on basic living expenses.<p>Consumption taxes are regressive because they penalize the spenders. Bill Gates doesn't spend nearly as much money as he earns and as such pays a lower effective tax rate than someone who makes $30,000 a year and spends it all to support their family.",1327254684

And there are no good alternatives.  I ran a manufacturing company (granted in California, a very employee friendly state) where everyone wanted to run 4 days of 10 hour shifts, called the 'alternative work week', instead of the usual 5 - 8 hour days.  There is a regulatory  means for doing this without it resulting in overtime pay.  The problem is, the regulations are onerous and full of potential pitfalls and the consequence of screwing it up is that an employee sues 2 years later and all those 2 hours logged over the usual 8 hour max are retroactively deemed overtime and must be paid to the employees.  So even though everyone wanted to put in an extra 2 hours each day to get the fifth day off, we couldn't do it because of the risk.

One example would be that Google doesn't have to worry about their engineers getting into a car crash on the way to work because the governments (federal and state) collectively spend billions of dollars ensuring that our roadways are safe for vehicles.<p>Another example would be that google doesn't have to spend money hiring private militaries or police forces to enforce their contracts because we have a judicial system that is paid for by the tax payers. This particular example is where your ""consumption"" argument falls down rather directly. Although it's true that they hire their own counsel, they are not the ones paying the salaries of all the various court officials. They ""consume"" these resources but in many peoples minds, myself included, do not pay their fair share.<p>>Similarly, my employees (all located here in India) don't pay any US income taxes. Is there some reason they should?<p>Of course not. The company that you set up and domiciled in America pays income taxes on the profit that you generate. Profit is usually defined as revenue minus expenses. Taxes paid in other countries are considered expenses and as such are accounted for.<p>>The loss carryforward is a necessary hack to the system to prevent taxation from penalizing businesses with volatile income streams.<p>Although we can both agree that GE's tax situation is very complex the problems that I and others have is that they directly lobby the government to get these tax incentives. The example I am thinking of is their lobbying arm advocating for an increased depreciation schedule on some of their capital equipment. This isn't fair.<p>The summary of my problem with your argument is that you benefit from all the things that America provides (government services, easy access to higher education, educated working class, pro-business climate, etc) but don't think that you should have to pay for any of this because ""you didn't consume it."" Just by living in America and being able to take advantage of these things you have consumed these things and you should have to pay your fair share.

To be sure, there's plenty of bad things to be said about corporations. But it's tremendously naive to believe that it's corporations that are calling all the shots.<p>Remember, the corporations looking for these perks are every bit as dependent on the power of government as the government is on corporate donations. So directing ire at corporations for trying to get rents out of the government, without simultaneously excoriating government officials for selling out, is misguided.<p>In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the only viable strategy to combat this is to combat the government abuses.<p>The corporations are doing what's natural: find places where they can get advantages over competitors, and take them to maximize shareholder value. But the government officials are more culpable. They are making promises that they (seem to) have no intention of keeping, and in doing so are blatantly violating their oaths of office. While the negative end results is the result of each, I believe that the members of the government are more immoral, and more deserving of our anger.<p>And the answer is not greater legislation to control corporations. That's just giving the government more power that they can sell to the highest bidder. The answer is to strip away the government's power. This may seem counterintuitive, because it appears to leave us unprotected against corporate abuse. But when the vehicle to that abuse is <i>through</i> government power, then curtaining that power leaves the corporations themselves unarmed against us.<p>This is really quite analogous to the arguments for/against gun control. Sure, demanding licensing of guns, etc., keeps the weapons out of the hands of much of the public. But the bad guys still get the guns, and the poor law-abiding citizens are then left defenseless. It's better, in my mind, to ensure that we can all compete on a level playing field, rather than handicap the citizenry so that the bad guys (or the corporations) get the power.",1327253316

A cross between a semi-anonymous Facebook, groups and politics, none of the social networky stuff, just ideas, viewpoints, groups and votes.<p>For example, you might belong to a very large simple 'liberal' group, with vague and general ideas.

Eventually you might find a group you nearly always agree with.<p>With enough support across the population, it would make it easy for everyone, including politicians to see how everyone felt on various topics.<p>To make this work, you'd need to put topics to people (in a fair way, with proper presentation of each viewpoint) and do some polling.

Does anyone know of any research on how the economics look for various groups of artists?<p>----<p>As an example:<p>Artist A is a top rated multiplatinum artist<p>Artist B is a touring, not so profitable but making a living artist<p>---<p>Do the economics of the industry for each artist change as piracy becomes more and less prevalent?<p>My gut is that artist B benefits as piracy becomes more prevalent because:<p>1)	Artist B makes their money from touring so distribution is unimportant to them for profitability, rather distribution is a form of marketing.<p>2)	 Artist A loses because their distribution is more profitable (still not as profitable as touring for the artist) but their distribution funds their marketing.<p>Are those 2 points true? Im going on what I think, but may be off.<p>More importantly Id like to hear if anyone knows of any analysis performed on the different classes and how they are impacted by piracy?  I would be willing to bet that if there are differences there are opportunities for niche business profits and if one wanted to make a good argument against anti-piracy legislation understanding those differences will be important for fighting those regulations.",1327252377

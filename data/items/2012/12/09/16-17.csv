4895104,comment,4894946,4894946,3,0,jasim,,,"> If I want to make a complex application run, chances are I'll need five gems to do it... and versioning is extremely important. I was following an application template that clearly spelled out all the gems and versions I would need to build it, but hit my first snarl when one gem wasn't quite prepared for Ubuntu 12.04...<p>Five gems? I haven't seen very many production Rails applications that can do with just five gems. More gems is mostly a good thing - each does just one thing, and does it well. It is like having more smaller methods instead of a few large methods.<p>> Are these gem heartburns a common problem in Ruby/Rails or is this mostly due to my ineptitude with the language?<p>Yes, gem heartburns can happen, but they are not very frequent. I'm sure the author will find that Bundler makes versioning an almost solved problem as he understands the language and ecosystem better. Good luck!",1355072331

That assumes actors exist, and others exist that can be acted upon. Then assume they share enough that they can communicate their individual values, eg I want to survive, avoid pain.<p>There are moral systems that are going to allow them to cooperate. Those moral systems are going to have some things in common, eg, reciprocity, or don't unnecessarily hurt others.<p>Nature tends to hardwire those, experiments show. Those would be universal moral values.<p>Beyond that, societies are going to evolve more complex systems, e.g. relieve yourself in the toilet, not in the public square; drive on the right. Some are going to follow more or less directly from universal principles given the environment, some are more like local maxima that people agree on.<p>One could say that a moral system that allows a bigger and more varied group to cooperate more successfully in more complex ways is better. So beyond the universal principles one could distinguish moral systems in more or less objective ways, as well as subjective ways like how repugnant they seem.<p>So, I'd agree that a lot of things people have strong moral views about are just fashions. Also that you can't get to one ideal moral system. Also that you need some first principles about how to determine harm. But I think there is a lot of morality that flows from simple first principles and is hardwired.",1355070633

Simply, it is just to engage in enjoyable acts.<p>Some of mine are: Watch an engaging documentary, read part of a book, take my laptop to an interesting place to work, (museum, park, cafe with a great view) cook a great meal or even buy a snack I love. Have coffee someplace nice, go for a walk in a scenic area, call an old friend, play with a dog.<p>I also like to watch documentaries or other factual programming. I DVR nature shows--the life of the ant was a good one--and sometimes even play them in the background while working. Being a skier and outdoor enthusiast, watching some ski movies pumps me up and helps me work. (Warren Miller movies are my favorites.) This may be more encouragement than brain health. Letting the Dick Proenneke documentaries play in the background is inspiring.<p>These activities can take a lot of time if you let them, but you can also be done with little commitment.

This is worse, because the Federal Circuit can never ultimately escape the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court should it choose to act. But the European Patent Court is a separate international institution, so if it is given sole jurisdiction over the European Unitary Patent, then there will be little to check it.",1355069018

If there were half as many people in Ireland in 1945, there would not be twice as much food to go around. The half-sized population would still have been packed into as little land as they could survive on. A crop failure would still mean starvation.<p>There was no surplus to fall back on, not because the population was so large that it overwhelmed reserves, but because the surplus wealth of Ireland was being systematically extracted so no such reserves could be built.",1355068846

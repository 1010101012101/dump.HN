This is incredibly anecdotal, but the half a dozen people I know who have come from Indian educational backgrounds (specifically IT programs) did not have much to show with their diplomas.  These are all incredibly bright people who seemed to start out levels behind their otherwise peers, and often rely (as we all do) on online material to make up for gaping flaws in their knowledge.  From the source article:<p><i>Hiring is slowing down because recruiters are changing their strategy. &quot;An engineering degree is a poor proxy for your education and employment skills,&quot; says Manish Sabharwal, chairman of TeamLease, a temp staffing firm.<p>&quot;The world of work is evolving... employers increasingly don&#x27;t care what you know, they focus on what you can do with that knowledge.&quot; While dozens of new institutes have been established in the past six or eight years, he claims that over a third of them are empty and perhaps they are &quot;worth more dead (for the real estate they sit on) than alive.&quot;</i><p>This suggests to me that many Indian STEM degrees are not an adequate proxy for value (just the same as many American STEM degrees.)<p>2.  I wish decentralized certification systems became a bigger thing.  Personally, I would love to be able to take a definitive test on whether or not I knew Python well enough to spend forty hours a week working in Python.  Make it open notes and timed, like the real world is.  I know this used to be a big thing in the 90&#x27;s, but that was before my time -- why did this go out of style?  Did the rapid advancement and evolution of the industry prove the system prohibitively time/effort-consuming?",1371956183

She emerged some time ago; this is a new article on her revelations and not strictly speaking breaking news. However, her revelations deserve further consideration and so it&#x27;s refreshing to see them redistributed in the current climate.<p>The broader background is that the nature of our fractional reserve system is one of wealth centralization via institutionalized, state-enforced usury, and humans have known about the perils of such schemes (for example, most of the monotheistic religions speak out about the dangers of these systems).<p>The World Bank and other &#x27;international&#x27; institutions have over the last few decades been largely unmasked as surrogate tools of the US State Department, for example through books such as <i>Confessions of an Economic Hitman</i>. Having had the chance to personally meet with diplomats who have confirmed details within such sources, and having received shocking responses to some FOIA requests in Europe (), I am in no doubt personally as to the way the wind blows in the global economic system.<p>IMHO, the challenge that humanity now faces is to adopt fairer and more holistic financial/economic systems that reward social and environmental concern, recognize the interlinked nature of our shared fate, and to transition our current economic systems (in the physical goods/supply chain sense) and our trajectory of technological development toward these new systems without causing sudden breakdowns.

To get there, sourcing additional data from individuals is a logical step... if you can rely on the sources.<p>IMHO the biggest issue with this whole area is that it is linked to the notion of driving culture which is in my worldview essentially past its apex and on the way out. I mean, I could see Tesla buying something similar to back electric vehicle networks, but not Google. With so many cities already covered by existing and reliable, government-issued, road sensor based live datasets, I am a little puzzled as to why anyone would care about this area.<p>Congrats to the newly wealthy as a result of this deal though; please consider contributing to more forward looking, socially engaged projects in future!",1371954194

As an example we can use FBI specs for maximum range of the NATO standard issue M855 cartridge for 5.56mm , which is 3600 yards.  Ballistics show a trajectory with 2200 foot drop at that range and a final velocity of 490fps with a retained energy of only 33ft/lbs (about 3% of muzzle energy).  To attain impact at 3600 yards requires the rifle to be elevated at about 11 degrees.  In reality, the bullet is likely to lose enough rotational velocity that it will destabilize much earlier, which will even more rapidly decrease velocity and power.<p>So, put simply, for this cartridge shooting in the air at an angle greater than 11 degrees relative to the horizon would not be particularly dangerous.",1371954074

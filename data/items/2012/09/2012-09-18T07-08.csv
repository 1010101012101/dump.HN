That the rich pay a larger share of the total taxes is a direct consequence of the fact that they have gotten richer as a group. Or in other words that the distribution of income has shifted to the top 10%.<p>So basically you are saying that the top 10% should complain about the fact that they get a larger share of the income pie,  with the consequence that they also pay a larger share of the tax pie. I would just be happy that I was earning more.",1347955193

In which case, why use them?<p>I actually did use them just for a CDN for a few more days. I use a second domain (sslcache.se) to proxy inline images in user generated content that doesn't originate from an SSL site but the user is viewing my site over SSL. Similar to this <a href=""https://github.com/atmos/camo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/atmos/camo</a> , except mine isn't written in node.js<p>Even then, users complained of broken images when they were logged in (on SSL).<p>The very basic thing: CloudFlare fails silently, sometimes. Well, that still happened with very basic content. From CloudFlares perspective the sslcache.se service was a site of static files, as I prime the content (download in the background) when a user submits the content. By the time the request for an item goes to CloudFlare the image is already being served from a local file system.<p>CDN only, it still errored enough that the end user noticed.

As Warren Buffett has said, ""If this is class warfare, my class is winning.""<p>As for your heritage foundation link, tax rates rise until you make something like $400k/year, and then start falling.  Taxes paid by the merely rich have little to do with taxes paid by the super-rich.  The big complaints have to do with the latter.  We no longer have a tax bracket for what is in inflation-adjusted dollars income over 5-6 million/year.  Might we be worse for that fact?<p>And finally if dropping the tax rates on the very rich results in them paying more money, that says very strongly that dropping those rates increases income disparity by more than it helps anyone else.

As a long-time iPhone user, the Android device market has been utterly bewildering to me. It took me a while to discover that the Nexus handsets were the only ones that (a) offered the naked/unskinned Android experience and (b) received Android updates from Google directly independent of network provider schedules (I think?).<p>Allowing handset manufacturers to skin the Android UI and bolt on their own wacky additions, then letting carriers determine when updates are provided has diluted and confused the Android handset marketplace, in my opinion. As an end-user, it is not just a choice between hardware; I also have to work out which manufacturer has 'reinterpreted' the Android UI, and which carrier will let me update the phone. (And I still haven't worked out how OS updates work if I buy a second-hand device off contract.) It can be wonderful to have such choice, but the Android phone market is far more confusing than the iPhone one.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/15/3022682/google-direct-sales-multiple-device-OEMs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/15/3022682/google-direct-sale...</a>",1347954773

According to the best available figures, the top theoretical tax rate during the 1950s was over 90%, but the average tax rate paid by the top approximately 400 people was 51.2%.<p>Big problem... You're comparing two completely different things. The 16% number is based on the fact that most of the wealth earn their income through capital gains which is taxed at a lower rate. So you're comparing income taxes to capital gains taxes. Two completely different items, apple to oranges.<p>> But it is pretty hard to reasonably come to the conclusion that the rich today are paying similar tax rates to the rich 55 years ago.<p>You're second point is also wrong. The rich actually pay a higher percentage of the tax burden when rates are cut. Look at the 20's. Taxes were slashed and the percentage of the income taxes paid by the rich doubled. Same today happened with the Bush cuts. The top 10% pay 71% of income taxes, and top 1% around 40%.

According to the best available figures, the top theoretical tax rate during the 1950s was over 90%, but the average tax rate paid by the top approximately 400 people was 51.2%.

But it is pretty hard to reasonably come to the conclusion that the rich today are paying similar tax rates to the rich 55 years ago.<p>As for taxes and economic growth, it is a trivial piece of economics to conclude that collecting more in taxes immediately takes money away from the economy.  However it is only slightly less trivial to conclude that the amount of damage it does is proportional to how likely that money was to get spent.  Given that the poor are likely to spent more than the rich, that means that we should prefer to tax the rich more.<p><i>Therefore</i> if you're going to levy taxes (and there is no reasonable way to avoid the need to), it is more efficient for all of us to tax the rich more heavily.

Retrieving one row out of 1 billion is not that much more complex than retrieving one row out of 1 million, nor is it that much more expensive computationally assuming the right index is in place.<p>The problem comes with high concurrency, in particular very high write concurrency, or with very complex queries which require a lot of RAM to do properly.  But that's where you need a solid db, good hardware, and a solid DBA.",1347951952

In particular, I bet that the current total effective tax rate (including not just income taxes but also FICA, sales tax, property tax, and implicit taxes from market interventions such as farm subsidies and the minimum wage) is already supra-optimal for economic growth. A wise and just sovereignsuch as a time-teleported and quickly-brought-up-to-speed Marcus Aureliuswould likely find that he could increase tax revenues by lowering (and streamlining) tax rates across the board.",1347951786

4536779,comment,4536552,4536730,7,0,tolmasky,,,"You began with the question of whether higher marginal tax rates made economic growth ""impossible"". After finding that there was growth between 1940 and 1980, you should have concluded ""no, it does not make it impossible as we have a counter example"". This follows and is called induction. But you for some reason chose to then alter the premise and say you proved that high marginal tax rates are <i>not harmful</i>. You have in no way proved this. For all you know without those high marginal tax rates, growth would have been even HIGHER between 1940 and 1980. I am sure you do not believe this to be the case, and that is a very reasonable belief, but understand that it is not <i>proven</i> by this evidence (nor is it disproven mind you).<p>True evidence-based proofs, the way its done with science, requires that you test one variable. In the example above you'd have to have a parallel economy where all else was the same except the tax rate. Unfortunately this is impossible, but this does not mean we get to change what ""proof"" means. Economics would work much better if everyone came to terms with the fact that it is <i>untestable</i> and was honest with themselves that all opinions regarding it are just beliefs, regardless which side you fall on.",1347951601

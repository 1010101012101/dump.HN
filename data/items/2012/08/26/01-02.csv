Marketing works hard so consumers will pay more for what they perceive is a better product. Even if it's not.<p>Now Apple has called attention to how similar Samsung products are and people ARE going to make this connection no matter what.<p>Even if Apple gets an injunction, do you think customers will still be willing to pay that premium over Apple products? They will at least start questioning their choices.<p>In this consumerist society we might as well see riots and protests so Apple lowers the prices or the govt cancels the injunctions.",1345946385

One of my favorite books described deriving the isp for the Saturn 5 engines and figuring out their total thrust. I memorize the cool way they put swirls in their arithmetic (it was and integral but I didn't know calculus existed yet) and the steps seemed so elegant. Once during my 5th grade class while doodling and daydreaming I recreated the entire derivation. My teacher (who was a math major it turned out) asked me what I had there and I explained it, as I had memorized it, each of the steps, each of the assumptions, the simplifying assumptions. That landed me in the principal's office. My Mom got called in and the school was trying to decide which Nobel prize I should be shooting for given my out sized intellect. My Mom or course blew it and pointed out it was just something I had read in a book :-) For a few minutes there I was the next Einstein!<p>That eventually lead me to a career in engineering, I was always drawn to being able to take problems no one had ever solved before and solving them.

Right now Samsung is trying hard to look like a cheaper apple product -- they have the same ""white"" apple stores with an equivalent genius bar (smart tutors), and they even reuse apple icons at their physical store wall paper (safari icons, etc).  Their boxes and cables are identical to Apple's, they made their onscreen keyboard identical (same white/blue style -- even the shading is identical).  Some of Samsung's products will even fit in 3rd party Apple addons that make use of the 30 pin dock.<p>I honestly don't think a new consumer will be able to easily differentiate between the 2 products.  My mom calls everything an ipad even if it's not -- I don't think she would know that she's buying a galaxy tablet and not an ipad.<p>I don't think copying drives innovation.  If cloning products drove innovation, we'd see a ton of China companies making innovative products, but most of them just clone some website in the US, slap on a few features, and that's it.<p>The China company that cloned Impactjs pixel-per-pixel did not provide anything additional other than providing the same service at half the price.<p>If Samsung wins here, it's basically setting a precedent for future companies to clone anything successful.  We'll probably see a lot more Chinese companies cloning YC startups without worrying about lawsuits.",1345945794

4434054,comment,4433031,4433031,2,0,johnkchow,,,"tl;dr: While not all recruiters are bad, I was better off just directly applying to companies and avoiding recruiters as much as possible.<p>A couple of months ago, I was interested in what the SF market had to offer, and I started responding to some of the emails coming my way.<p>Over the three month period, I've probably been approached by 3 retained recruiters and 10 contingent recruiters. All the retained recruiters (i.e. internal company recruiters) were thorough, thoughtful, and curated the opportunities to my career goals.  Not only did they make sure that I was a qualified for the job, they made sure from the get go that I'm a good cultural fit and the position aligns with my personal goals.<p>Contingent recruiters, on the other hand, rarely asked what I wanted to do. Every single interview that they'd supposedly set up for would fall through, either because they didn't double check the position's needs or that they had communication problems with the hiring company. Additionally, the recruiters' coworkers would call me in the middle of the day several times a week to tell me about some new opportunities. I was still working at the time, and it was annoying to constantly step out of the office to hear nothing substantial. The whole process left me feeling like I was just a piece of meat.<p>In the end, I had a much better experience just getting a list of companies that were hiring from the recruiter and directly applying with the companies I was interested in myself. When the HR asks how I was referred, I'd usually mention the recruiter out of karma. If I were to do it again, I'd probably avoid the recruiters altogether and go directly for the companies I actually care about.",1345945612

They could have seized major portions of the software patent landscape early on, they thought about going down the path Apple is on and they decided against it.  In contrast to Cook's statements here, Bezos basically said software patents are not our future and other companies should follow our lead.<p>If you truly understod the patent system you'd realise it's a lot less ""cut and dry"" than you perceive it to be.  Patent law with all its wonderful intricacies that many spend careers learning can get you to an issued patent.  But an issued patent can't guarantee you anything, except the right to sue alleged infringers.  It gives you no ""right to a monopoly"" only a right to sue.  It gives you no right to manufacture or sell anything.  Someone else might sue you you, regardless of your patent.  That's not the patent office's problem.<p>Your issued patent is only as good as it holds up in litigation.  And patent litigation is more or less a crap shoot.  With high stakes.<p>The only way to determine the ""validity"" of a patent claim is to litigate it.  And Federal Circuit decisions are not exactly ""consistent"" so as to be ""predictable"", to say the least.  The end result is patent litigation is extraordinarily expensive and is to be to be feared, even when the patent claims being asserted are garbage.<p>The issue is not with the patent system in general.  The issue is with how Apple is using the system.<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with patents or intellectal property.<p>The problem is with companies like Apple who think it is all some kind of game.<p>Again, the problem is not IP.  IP is just rules.<p>The problem is Apple, specifically the people who run the company.  The problem is the actions they take.<p>When nerds on the web discuss IP, unfortunately it ends up being employed as the proverbial ""straw man"".  Nerds ignore the actions of Apple and instead debate IP.  But IP is not a person, real or imaginary.  IP makes no decisions.  IP is just a concept.  The decisions and the evil being done here are by _people_.  Patent law (or any law) does not mandate that anyone has to behave like an a-hole.  That is a decision Apple makes, not the drafters of patent laws.<p>But Apple thinks that just because they can afford to dump millions into legal fees, month after month, year after year, it gives them the justification to make life miserable for everyone else (forcing them to spend the same amounts or be forced out of the game).<p>Apple behaves like an a-hole.

If you change region and try to update things will get messy pretty fast, or so I was told.<p>He's right that you lose all records of installed apps, but if you try to buy them again in the new region, Apple does recognize that you already own the app and does not charge for it again. It's a shame that things on the internet are region-bound, it's one thing I hope will disappear in the not too distant future, but for now such is life (applies to music/movies as well).<p>Apart from the above annoyance though it has worked great so far, my account is the same as if I had created a US one from scratch.

Most rare resources are durable, i.e. used in applications where they aren't destroyed.  So if indium reserves in the ground run out, then as the prices rise, (1) the prices of new devices that need indium will rise, discouraging their adoption and (2) the scrap prices of old devices that have indium will rise, until it becomes profitable to recycle them to create a new supply.<p>At a fundamental physical level, if you have a rare substance made of common elements (e.g. many fuels and plastics are just H, C and O in various arrangements) there's usually a chemical process you can use to create them with basically only energy as input.<p>If you have a rare substance that is partly or entirely made of one or more rare elements, you can generally create them by refining the products of nuclear reactions (e.g. this is where plutonium comes from).<p>Where lack of a particular material becomes an obvious bottleneck, money will flow into R&D which will unlock more alternatives over time (we've known oil is a bottleneck since the oil shocks of the '70s if not earlier, think of all the billions that have flowed into alternate energy R&D between then and now, and how many new things we have like wind, solar, geothermal, hybrids, biofuels, synfuels, etc., or energy-efficient CPU's with dynamic frequency scaling and market competition on performance-per-watt metrics.  These do work and can substitute for oil in many applications.)<p>Eventually asteroid mining will probably become a very profitable way to produce certain key materials (rare earth elements do come to mind) because it will turn out to be more a cost-effective way to produce some materials than chemical or nuclear reactions.  Especially if we can figure out ways to utilize them that don't involve shuttling things into and out of Earth's gravity well so we can use extremely energy-efficient ion drives that can cross the solar system on a few pounds of fuel instead of rockets that use tons of chemical propellants.  Perhaps self-sufficient space factories, entirely robotic, which build computers on asteroids using local materials, which when finished are powered and linked to the Internet by solar or nuclear power, rented as a new EC2 instance by the hour at dirt-cheap prices (but still a profitable business since the manufacturer doesn't have to bid high to win some of Earth's dwindling local supply of rare earths, the power plant doesn't have to worry about where to dump its nuclear waste since it's a million miles from the nearest human, and the R&D costs can be amortized over a thousand-asteroid deployment).",1345943803

And Apple's world, or jail as you call it, is beautiful, well designed, has better font rendering, it's fast, it makes the right assumptions about my use, and so one. So I can't hack the kernel. So what? I don't need or want to. That's kind of why I bought an Apple to begin with.<p>Philosophies about freedom, free software, or really any philosophies or beliefs do not apply here. That argument is just a red herring. The value of the machine is in its substitutes. My Macs don't have any substitutes. There's not a single PC out there that can match the quality, beauty, and experience of my Macs. But not everyone uses them like I do so I can understand if others don't believe they're valuable. But as far as Samsung goes, what they did was basically try to trick people into thinking that they'll get the Apple experience on a Samsung just because they look alike.<p>And just so everyone knows, at my job I work 8+ hours a day on a Windows7 PC. I've had an Android phone. I also have a Linux laptop. I love my Linux box but it still doesn't hold a candle to my MacBook Air. This isn't about fashion. It's about people finding a product so impressive that they truly love it. I own a lot of stuff but very few of my possessions are as valuable to me as my Macs. Call me a fanboy. I don't give a shit. That argument is a lame copout. People see people like me being truly impressed with something, they don't get it, then they write it off as fanboyism. It's just a meaningless argument meant to explain something people don't understand. A lot like how people ascribe religious significants to events they don't understand. No, that's not hyperbole. It's just like that.",1345943259

Terahertz is far-far infrared, (1mm to .1mm (1,000,000-100,000nm) wavelength) while NIR is around 1,000nm. Visible light is 740-380nm.<p>To the best of my knowledge, (this isn't my field) nobody has ever made a visible-light metamaterial. The antennas are too small. There's no real physical reason we can't make red-light metamaterials, the problem is just fabrication. (A parallel can be drawn here between metamaterials, desktop nanofactories, and fusion reactors)<p>Additionally, it would be tricky to make a panchromatic metamaterial lens: metamaterials are tuned very precisely to one frequency, (color) constrained by the physical size of the antennas, and they can't transmit any others.",1345943226

The stories of people ""making it"" are always inspirational, though for every one of those, there are thousands of people toiling away in obscurity with nothing (material) to show for those efforts. If people blindly followed the above, the world would literally be filled with people attempting watch TV, play video games, read books, nap, or just plain do nothing for a living (for example). And, yes, people can try to turn all those into different forms of livelihoods, but how many would actually manage to make a living wage doing that? Less than 1% at the most extreme? Probably.<p>Further, sometimes you have to do what you like rather than what you love. Or maybe even what you need rather than what you like. I get paid a very nice salary to do something I quite like, but don't necessarily love. The thing I love to do, on its face, pays 10x-15x less than what I do now. I am working at creating a venture that includes what I love and hopefully could ramp up to my wage now, but that takes time and I need to do it smart...because people depend on me.<p>I do encourage people to take chances when they are young, or when the kids are out of the house, but there is a window of time when your dreams and aspirations are LESS IMPORTANT than the people who depend on you. This is just part of being a mature, non-selfish adult.<p>So, if you want to chase your dreams and only your dreams (re: happiness), do it in such a way that others are not impacted. If you have a family, or kids, my advise is to not be selfish. If you can do it in such a way that you are not putting them at risk, great. If not, I believe you should wait until such a time that they are self-sufficient.",1345943059

""They <i>had</i> to defend their property!"".  No they didn't.<p>Throughout the 2000's we had an orthodoxy that all these seemingly obvious and bogus patents being filed by huge companies were OK because they were for ""defensive"" purposes. In other words, the very premise for why most of these patents were not vociferously protested against was the fact that the companies <i>were not</i> going to exercise them aggressively.  Now that the stockpile has been accumulated we have people like you saying ""Well, it's not their fault, since they have the patents they <i>have</i> to defend them!"".

4433958,comment,4432652,4433729,4,0,snprbob86,,,"I don't have hard numbers, so let's do some math on talent acquisitions.<p>It's been said that engineers are worth up to $1M in talent acquisitions [1]. We talked to <i>lots</i> of folks while negotiating our deal and that number matches what we learned for the total cost of the acquisition, including retention packages (about 3 years) and the cash portion of the deal.<p>For the same of argument, let's describe a <i>large</i> and expensive talent acquisition, as a sort of ""worse case"" for the acquiring company. I'll use roundish numbers to make the math easy: Let's say a $2M raise on a $8M valuation, for a $10M post money valuation in a company that had 10 engineers at the time of acquisition.<p>Usually, in talent acquisitions, the investors barely break even, but occasionally, they get 2X. So again for our example company, let's say that the acquirer pays $4M cash up front and $16M over 3 years for the 10 employees. That's $2M per engineer! Waaay off the charts. If you assume an even distribution (never the case; the founders and key people get a bigger slice), then that's an average of $533k/year per person.<p>If the average senior engineer's salary is $150k/yr, then then acquired employees need to be 3.6X more productive than a same-sized team of typical senior engineer to justify the costs of the acquisition. Note that this entirely ignores recruiting: Finding 10 senior engineers is <i>fucking hard</i>. Even if it was dirt cheap (it's not), it costs a lot of time and it's a gamble on creating a team of 10 people who truly gel. If you've ever worked at a big company, you know that there are always teams that outperform others by factors of INFINITY (ie. some teams are incapable of shipping), never mind beating the average by 3.6X.<p>Again, this is a pretty bad deal for the acquirer. The overwhelming majority of talent acquisitions are <i>much</i>much* smaller. In those smaller deals, the economics make even more sense for the buyer.<p>I realize that my math is fuzzy here. However, you gotta believe that the people running fortune 500 companies have done the math in far greater detail and decided that it's economical. It would be a worthwhile project for someone to create a more thorough analysis with what-if variables.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Startup-Acquisitions/Does-Facebook-have-a-calculated-cost-per-engineer-when-it-acquires-for-talent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Startup-Acquisitions/Does-Facebook-have...</a>",1345942927

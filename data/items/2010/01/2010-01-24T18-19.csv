1073581,comment,1073280,1073394,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Precisely.<p>The history of personal computing since the eighties does have something to teach us about ""the power of variety"". It teaches us that consumers don't rate variety very highly compared to consistency, software compatibility and -- above all -- price. In the early 1980s there was a wide variety of microcomputer operating systems and hardware platforms to choose from. Today, we are down to two operating systems, broadly speaking -- Windows and Unix -- and pretty much one PC hardware platform, built around commodity x86 processors and their associated commodity motherboards and peripherals.<p>Commodity PCs grew to dominate the market because they were a <i>commodity</i>, which is another way of saying that they were <i>essentially all the same</i>. For a while you couldn't even get them in a different <i>color</i>; if you didn't like beige you had to go buy some spray paint and mod your own case. If you bought a PC you knew that it would support a standard monitor and a standard PC mouse and a standard PC keyboard and would run Microsoft Excel if you wanted to pay the standard price for the standard-issue operating system.<p>The major reason why PC manufacturers proliferated so wildly was price, but that battle is largely over: Twenty-five years of price wars and middleman-elimination, aided by the internet, have done their work, and now literally everybody has their hardware built by Foxconn or some other company within half an hour's bicycle ride of Foxconn, and it all costs roughly the same feature-for-feature. It's just a different world than it used to be.",1264356980

1073561,comment,1072315,1073538,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> Oh man, that's awesome!<p>Thanks :) It was a lot of fun.<p>> Have you considered modeling a more ""real-world"" computing fabric?<p>That's what this is leading in to, the simplest unit is just a way for me to know that it is doable. If I can't do 'life' then there is no point in going any further with it.<p>One of the HN members here is very far in coming up with a higher level concept but I feel that it needs to be done from the 'gate level' up.<p>> Your cells would have randomly-distributed computation and communication delays, and you could make some sort of visualization of the time waves propagating, and it would just be really cool.<p>I did that for a bit, it is easy enough to show the generations as colours.<p>> I initially didn't think this would be possible to implement in simple physical hardware, but your insight that you only need a two-bit time counter changes things.<p>Yes, that's what made me really happy :) I realized that with a 'full' generation count you could make it work but that would always limit the maximum generation count to the number of bits in the counters. So why not turn it around and see how few bits you can use and handle the 'wrapping' properly. The number is 2, and that's low enough to use a simple 4-to-1 demultiplexer to select the right state line (current or previous generation).<p>> Of course, ultimately, I think what you'd want to look at is amorphous computing.<p>I had not heard the term before, more reading to do!<p>> I think you'll really enjoy amorphous computing.<p>Yes, that sounds like it is exactly the way to go.<p>I will write a fair sized article at the end of this month about where I feel computing is headed, this as a follow up on the new years day posting about what we think the future will bring.<p>I thought the question was an important one and I'm hitting two birds with one stone here, first the interest in cell computing and second the information I'm gathering to answer that question about the future.<p>Fascinating stuff.",1264356246

1073558,comment,1073246,1073246,0,0,barrkel,,,"Nothing I read in the replies or MA's commentary actually countered the substance of Jason's argument.<p>Fred's line: ""someone has to pay, so pay up."" That sounds like a straight-up mobster.<p>Linda Abraham's line: ""we measure people"" (what about dogs? I wondered), ""we have a slightly cheaper option of 5K"". IOW, we can be flexible in what we hit you up for. Oh, and we have cameras in people's homes, so we know the difference between people, machines and cybernetic half-breeds.<p>MA's line: this person is right, someone needs to get paid, Jason's wrong. The judge and jury in one persona, but logic-free.<p>But all this doesn't address the core fact: that people using ComScore to evaluate a site (why can't these people pay?) can be greatly influenced by the sites paying ComScore for ""auditing"" and other ancillary services to make sure they ""get counted correctly"". 'Cos you know, if you don't pay up, some ""accidents"" might happen.",1264356136
1073557,comment,1073473,1073473,0,0,wallflower,,,"Reminds me of something fun we used to do when we had ample free time as kids: We would put random color patterns with crayons on construction paper and then overlay the entire page with black crayon and then scrape through the black to 'draw' with colored fills (the fills being the previously hidden background we made first).<p>Try it - it's awesome for kids.",1264356108
1073556,comment,1072315,1073347,0,0,sketerpot,,,"You can always use a clock and a counter to delay for a period of time that you know is greater than the worst-case time that the operation could take. Or randomize it up a bit. Or design the logic to take similar times for all crypto operations.<p>Here's another cool thing: by using a dual-rail encoding (one wire being high means a bit is 0, the other wire being high means the bit is 1) you can design logic that consumes roughly constant power no matter what the operands are. This makes power-analysis attacks a lot more difficult.<p>Here's a paper on all this that you may enjoy:<p><a href=""http://www.gemplus.com/smart/rd/publications/pdf/MAM03as.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gemplus.com/smart/rd/publications/pdf/MAM03as.pdf</a>",1264356024

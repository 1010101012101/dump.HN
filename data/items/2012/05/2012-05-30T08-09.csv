To be completely honest, I would expect no less from Java or python within the same major release, namely for the language and the interpreter to ""just work"" and understand my existing code but I would still be very worried about the functionality of my own software and all the libraries it comes with and that's what my own tests are for - but having these is no Perl-language-specific merit.

This does not do what a C/Java/C# programmer would expect.<p>`return` in Haskell is a false cognate and it causes beginners difficulties. Some of them post to StackOverflow asking confused questions about it.<p>if-then-else in Haskell is also a false cognate (and there are formatting issues to trip up the unwary as well). It's actually the same as C's/Java's/etc ?: operator, so it's unfortunate the standard library doesn't contain something similar to that instead of adding if-then-else to the language.<p>Having said all that, I don't think being a false cognate should automatically be a disqualifying attribute. Haskell's new <> operator (a synonym for mappend) looks like Basic's/Pascal's not-equal-to operator. But I think few Haskellers come from that immediate background.",1338368254

There are multiple reasons why it might be confused: I might have taken a wrong turn either on purpose or by accident. Or it might have an incorrect positional information or incorrect maps.

A simple chime is pleasant -- but far less intuitive, you'd have to learn a new signal. Plenty of people are confused by navs making a chime sound when you're over the speed limit.

And in a farm of cloud web servers I had one doing this big batch job and then syncing the others... effectively a master.<p>So I scrapped that and went to dynamically generated upon request. But the problem I found with this was content deletion changing the URLs in the higher numbered sitemap files... i.e. content in the first few files get deleted, all subsequent files shift slightly across the now visible URLs. Because Google and others may only take some sitemaps one day, and some the next... you risk appearing to have duplicate info in your sitemaps... I prefer long-cacheable sitemaps anyway... the URLs in file #23 should always be in #23 and not another file.<p>So I'm, moving towards dynamic generation based on a database table that stores all possible URLs and will associate batches of 20,000 URLs per sitemap file... if I delete content referenced by sitemap #1, then that now has 19,999 URLs and site map #2 remains at 20,000 URLs. A second benefit of such a table is that I can use a flag to indicate whether the content has been deleted and use that to determine whether to 404 or 410 when that URL is accessed.<p>If anyone feels that they have a better way of doing this, I'd love to know it.<p>Ideally, it would be non-batch generated, and strongly associate a URL to a given sitemap file.",1338367524

65769,story,,,3,7,catalinist,"For Reddit devs : make something about ""submitting too fast""",,"I understand that it's suppose to be an anti-flood system, but you have to do something about it because there are users who want to submit a couple of subj. one after another - if ""you're submitting too fast. try resubmitting again in a little while."" msg. comes why they want to submit they might not come back again to resubmit after the waiting time is over. That's because they've already moved-on from the subject or lost interest in submiting it, or just have a short attention-span. I suggest something like a queue maybe, to at least not lose the subject with the ""submit too fast"" msg. Is there something done about this in the rewrite I've heard about ?",1192020905

This seems like a good(ish) idea, but also one that is not as easy as it sounds.  There are no ISO standards for titles, so something like ""VP of Business Development"" can mean wildly different things from person to person, or company to company.<p>You would have to (IMO) do a lot to standardize the input options and verify the data to make it really useful.<p>",1192020162

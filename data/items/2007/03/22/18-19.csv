5758,comment,5694,5694,0,0,pg,,,"This will be an interesting data point about whether two giant companies (and not even technology companies) can produce something to compete with a startup.  I think the odds are heavily against them.  In fact, it might be worth starting the startup they'll have to buy when their own in-house development efforts fail.",1174589947

It's not a replacement, but it's a good conversation starter. We might even see some startups from founders meeting online through YC News. Have there been any examples of this so far?<p>Speaking of which: extantproject at gmail dot com if anyone out there would like to throw some ideas around.",1174589601

What do I care? I want managers to come to me and say: `Let's give a really big raise to Sally because she's getting a lot done' - not because she's chained to her desk.""",1174589514

5749,comment,5700,5700,0,0,imperator,,,"The figure you give depends on your feelings which are created from your internal and external circumstances. I immidiately asked myself the question, ""What do I want?""<p>This was my answer:\n$2,000,000 for property,\n$1,000,000 for the house (I live in Silicon Valley),\n$2,000,000 for traditional reinvestment,\n$1,000,000 to start the next company,\n$6,000,000 total for each partner,<p>After three months, it depends on where the software is. However, the purchasing company will be the one evaluating that aspect. For me, it is a question of what I want versus what they are willing to give in return.\n",1174589279
5748,comment,5700,5708,0,0,pg,,,"Honestly, this is not a hard question.  We're not asking you what you think we want as a return.  We're asking what you'd take.  <p>So if you think 3 million is a fantastic deal, then you haven't answered the question correctly.  We're not asking what you think would be a fantastic deal, but what would be the <i>worst</i> deal you'd still accept.  Would you really turn down 2 million for three months' work?<p>Incidentally, we don't even think about what we want as a return.  Some VCs may, but we don't.  We just fund anyone who seems good, and assume the returns will take care of themselves.",1174589264
5747,comment,5700,5701,0,0,pg,,,"""Approaching the question?""  How about just answering truthfully?  What would someone have to offer, assuming nothing else about the deal?<p>If you put some high number no one would offer, you're not really answering the question, are you?  If you say you'd need 20 million, I'm going to ask: so if someone offered 19, you'd say no?",1174589067

5745,comment,5716,5742,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"That's funny.  Steve's probably a good guy to do it, too.  I met with him at a small roundtable when I was leading a consulting firm (Microsoft gold partner).  He was great--spoke 200 words/minute about all of the products they had right around the corner.  I wrote them all down and then checked about six months later.  They delivered on the Office Live stuff (about 50% of what he'd said), but then everything else was pretty flat.<p>He was fun to be around though.  :)\n",1174588634
5744,comment,5677,5677,0,0,pg,,,"Bummer; I thought this was going to be an announcement about a new program where they closed deals quickly.  The startup funding business needs something like that.  Current funding procedures are a huge time suck for founders, who need to be working on their software, not spending weeks negotiating with investors.  Most founders would trade valuation to get deals to close faster.  At least, I'd advise them to.",1174588512

5742,comment,5716,5716,0,0,pg,,,"Ever wonder why a big co like Microsoft would have a ""VC summit?""  Traditionally the point was to explain where Microsoft planned to expand, in order to frighten VCs out of investing in companies in that area.  VCs being what they are, that kind of thing works surprisingly well.",1174588336

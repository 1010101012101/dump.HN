Is that correct? If so, that's a little fragile for my tastes. I like ""upgrading servers"" by standing up new servers, testing they work, and then changing the floating IP associated with the DNS to point to them instead.<p>And I can hear you say ""Aha! Floating IP! Just use that!"" but for most cloud providers (I believe), that is billed as external bandwidth, which is not free like internal requests are. Finally, if I want to stand up more servers to scale horizontally, I'd still have to modify my code and redeploy it to all my servers. I think. Unless I'm missing something about how 0mq works.

You have a positive expectation value, and 99.9% chance of ending up penniless. Is one that buys the tickets really a much more rational person than one who does it when the jackpot is $8 million?

It's in the network provided by the VC (and to a lesser extent the marketing).<p>This is best reason to enter YC with an established (but small) company: to turn your small ""life style"" size business into something with a very large reach.<p>I'm sure that the latest batch of YC companies would agree with my reasoning.  You give YC a fraction of a small pie to greatly increase the chances of your plan to turn it into a big pie.<p>My 2-5 year plan: build a $2 - $5m business (and the core team) in Europe around an idea that has the potential* to be a $500m+ business in America: then give YC a slice in exchange for their advice.<p>* What I'm working on has massive niche in a sector far away from the web.  So we can build the idea, business and tech out away from the prying eyes of the incumbents.  Now most of the incumbents will have trouble competing with us (different strategy), with one massive exception.  If they knew about the niche we knew about, they would fill it (the niche along can support several $100m + companies).",1350720102

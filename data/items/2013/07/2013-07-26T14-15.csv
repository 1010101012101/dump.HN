An American businessman was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them. The Mexican replied only a little while. The American then asked why didn&#x27;t he stay out longer and catch more fish? The Mexican said he had enough to support his family&#x27;s immediate needs.
The American then asked, but what do you do with the rest of your time?
The Mexican fisherman said, &quot;I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life, seor.&quot;
The American scoffed, &quot;I am a Wharton MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats. Eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually NYC where you will run your expanding enterprise.&quot;
The Mexican fisherman asked, &quot;But seor, how long will this all take?&quot;
To which the American replied, &quot;15-20 years.&quot;
&quot;But what then, seor?&quot;
The American laughed and said, That&#x27;s the best part. When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions.&quot;
&quot;Millions, seor? Then what?&quot;
The American said, &quot;Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.&quot;",1374849234

This article is a lot of speculation based on a statement that they&#x27;ve said something and then an existing service offered by one ISP. Clearly they&#x27;re not going to block games and dating sites which this service does so it&#x27;s not clear why we should assume that it&#x27;s any sort of useful template for what&#x27;s proposed.<p>ISPs have a stated objection to these proposals (if only because they understand what&#x27;s really involved) and it feels to me a little like this could just be spin from their camp. Suggesting that this is the start of wider censorship would certainly be a way of pushing the public against it which would suit the ISPs cause.<p>None of which is to say that what they&#x27;re saying is wrong or that it&#x27;s good bad or indifferent, just that my reading of the article is that it doesn&#x27;t really have much to support it&#x27;s claims.<p>All that said we know for sure that the proposals will block things other than porn if only because it&#x27;s almost impossible to accurately define porn or build a perfect filter for it based on whatever definition you have. There will be false positives and negatives both in terms of definition and implementation, meaning that stuff will absolutely be restricted which shouldn&#x27;t be (and let through when it should).

Expensive, or 2. Unreliable in providing a native-feeling application. We chose to develop a Client-Server Android app and add iOS when funds become available.<p>I&#x27;m a college student and an opportunity came along from our vet program to make a smartphone application, I jumped at it. They had no idea about platforms but eventually wanted iOS/Android and possibly Windows. The only computers I own run Xubuntu, Windows7, Ubuntu, and Fedora at school. So iOS was obviously out of the picture at this point.<p>I originally researched along the lines of a cross-platform mobile framework. After looking/asking around it seems these technologies really aren&#x27;t there yet, especially if you&#x27;re looking at using any native functionality on the device. I read lots of developer reviews and they were generally mixed in terms of reliability and performance. Also, some are quite expensive; I recall seeing a 1-year dev license for $1000 a year per developer. Possibly worth it for a huge corporation, but just not for us at this stage in the game. It took some convincing but I steered them away from this option.<p>I have experience in Android so we chose to develop a native stand-alone Android prototype (they needed something simple to use to re-apply for their grant next round/present to other investors), and plan on moving it to a Client-Server architecture Android application and I&#x27;ll either purchase a cheap Mac Mini and learn obj-c or hire a iOS developer once we have allocated more funding to hook it up on the same server as the Android application. This way you can use the same server back-end logic for dispatching data and have native GUI for each supported platform.<p>edit: grammar",1374848280

You don&#x27;t need liberty if everyone else approves of your actions. As a corollary, the exercise of liberty does not require a justification, because it&#x27;s a liberty, practicality or &quot;usefulness&quot; or what-have-you play no part in it. It&#x27;s onerous to require someone to justify their right to look at porn. It&#x27;s even more onerous to ask people to put their name on a list as someone who desires the ability to look at porn. And indeed this is how freedoms are eroded. Because once you put things on a different footing and you require people to justify their freedoms then it becomes ever more difficult to justify anything. Can you justify eating a cheap, greasy cheeseburger? Can you justify watching &quot;Jersey Shore&quot;? Are you willing to?<p>These are precisely the same sorts of tactics that have been used since the dawn of time for busybodies to rein in individual freedoms of others, and thereby to obtain greater authority over others.<p>People often dismiss out of hand the notion that tyranny could possibly take hold over the first world democracies of the west in the 21st century. And to that I can only sigh. Perhaps it will not be known as tyranny, perhaps someone will come up with a different, more apt name once (if) we are in the clutches of it, but it will be every bit as bad and every bit as difficult to throw off, if not more so.",1374848273

Frankly, Intel had the foresight to start the Atom project to hedge their bets a little bit.<p>They never &quot;really&quot; tried to compete in the smartphone market (which is ~2W), the Atom was instead always targeted at ~10W. (IIRC, Intel&#x27;s real focus at that time were Consumer Ultra-Low Voltage, CULV processors at the 18W envelope. Today... known as Ultrabooks). However, as Smartphones became the next hot thing, it is now obvious that Intel has to scale the Atom down even further. And unfortunately, the netbook market imploded.<p>Its not all wasted however, IMO, netbooks &quot;became&quot; tablets. From a CPU perspective, there is little difference between Netbooks and Tablets. You want low-power consumption between 5W to 10W, and lower costs. In fact, as netbooks were &quot;dying out&quot;, they slowly became tablets. See AsusTab Smart for example, it basically is a Netbook without a keyboard, but built with a touchscreen. (same price range as Netbooks of old, but just in tablet form).<p>Anyway, Intel hasn&#x27;t forgotten the Smartphone market either. Thus the Atoms that worked closer to the 2W SoC benchmark... Medfield, Clovertrail, and soon to be Bay Trail Atoms. Clovertrail is winning a few benchmarks here and there, and Bay Trail will be built on Intel&#x27;s latest process for once. So it looks like Intel is finally taking the smartphone market seriously. But only the last generation or so are actual attempts at a Smartphone chip... and even then, there isn&#x27;t a single Atom out there that is built on Intel&#x27;s latest 22nm process. That will only come from the future Bay Trail Atoms.",1374847843

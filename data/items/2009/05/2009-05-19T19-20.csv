In some places there's a big gap between the cost of owning and the cost of renting.  In Silicon Valley, renting is much cheaper than buying, because there is still so much expectation of future growth built into house prices.  So you can't use house prices as an index of how affordable the Bay Area is for e.g. someone who's 25, because they probably don't want to buy a house yet anyway.",1242763020

That's not Quantum Field Theory. You don't need 10 years of training to learn humanities. Just grab a bunch of books and read that while you're a child / teenager because children and teenagers do have the time for it.<p>I advocate more math for everyone: if the ""soft"" majors like humanities and economics were humiliated on a daily basis with math problem sets, they probably would grow to be more humble, logical and (nasty side-effect) bitter people. Mathematicians and natural scientists do know how hard it is to actually KNOW something, how to try to falsify your own hypotheses, etc.  That makes one a better citizen than knowing Japanese, Literary Criticism or why the French Revolution happened.<p>History is really interesting! Seriously! Why wait until you're 18 to study it when you can read about the Greeks and Romans when you're 10? I loved History when I was a kid. Humanities education is vital, but it should be cherished and nurtured and provided to students between the ages of 10-18.

It's a ""smaller"" language, in much the same way that Scheme is smaller than Common Lisp.

What have you done wrong by making a competitor to your previous companies product? I ask this because I am thinking of doing something similar due to the fact that my employer is extremely incompetent. I am the only developer of a project that I helped take from no revenue to hundreds of thousands of dollars revenue but that should be making millions of dollars revenue. Unfortunately, I am micro-managed and often just have to implement the ridiculous ideas of my boss.<p>If I made a competitor, it would obviously share some of the same ideas as the current project. I mean, every social network has an &quot;add friend&quot; function, for example. Some things are just the right way to do things, or inherently part of the business domain.<p>If they started patenting all of my ideas, I would expect to actually be paid a decent salary.",1442980466

The limit on a hardware company usually isn&#x27;t the idea, it&#x27;s the execution.  And crowd sourcing significant portions of the design process to an amorphous community doesn&#x27;t seem like a huge advantage: hardware design and manufacturing is really the province of specialists, oftentimes with very deep domain knowledge.  If I&#x27;m going to build a camera, I&#x27;m going to get someone who&#x27;s built cameras before, not cars.<p>I just think the wisdom of the crowd can&#x27;t replace that deep domain knowledge, but I might have been biased against Quirky from the beginning: I met the team at TED years ago, before they were Quirky -- I think they were called &#x27;Kluster&#x27; at the time.  They were trying to transition from being a hardware startup that made ipod/iphone accessories to a &#x27;crowd-sourced idea marketplace&#x27; or something.  But their most impressive employee was leaving, because they couldn&#x27;t find a role for him through the transition, and clearly weren&#x27;t doing anything to retain him (ironically, he was a hardware guy... would&#x27;ve been helpful in the transition to Quirky).<p>So I guess I see this as a morality tale about recognizing and retaining talent more than anything.",1442980116

You realize my potential and pay me the $150k I am worth compared to the $80k I make now, considering I routinely provide the quantity of work you get from 3-4 juniors at $50k each, at a superior quality where every line of code written isn&#x27;t adding to the technical debt.<p>Oh, and I&#x27;ll take my 4-5 weeks of yearly vacation instead of the 2-3 bullshit weeks you expect me to be satisfied with.

And just because someone threatens to sue someone else does <i>not</i> mean the party being sued did anything wrong, it just means plaintiff wanted to sue the defendant.<p>I&#x27;m speaking from personal experience, a former employer threatened to sue me for unspecified &#x27;trade secret infringement,&#x27; and it cost over $20k in legal fees to convince ourselves we were covering all our bases.<p>The problem is there&#x27;s a basic asymmetry in these situations: it costs very little to initiate a lawsuit, or even just threaten to initiate a lawsuit.  We were so scared we spent money on lawyers (and a second opinion!) before anything had even hit the court system.<p>Probably obvious advice we should&#x27;ve taken: do nothing until they&#x27;d actually filed something, then respond only to specific allegations.

From a systems engineering perspective, radical transparency can simultaneously increase government power and accountability. Government privacy (e.g., via state-secrets laws) is just a special case of the problems that occur when we restrict access to data.<p>Right now, we seem trapped in the worst of all worlds. The government engages in mass surveillance, so a rogue actor within the state could exploit the accumulated data for the unlawful purposes that you mentioned. And private corporations have access to almost as much information, with equal opportunities to abuse it but fewer democratic checks on their power. At the same time, we forgo virtually all of the potential societal benefits of data aggregation.<p>If surveillance is justified to prevent terrorism (and I realize that most here would dispute that), why is it not appropriate to use the same data to protect people from risks that claim thousands more lives every year?<p>I don&#x27;t think that ubiquitous surveillance necessarily makes police corruption more alluring. One of the most recent policy responses to police misconduct has been the nationwide push for body cameras on individual officers, which is itself a form of surveillance. But it&#x27;s one that obviously increases accountability, so it doesn&#x27;t have all of the usual stigmas.<p>When placed within a proper governing structure, I see no intrinsic reason that other forms of surveillance could not be enlisted for the same purpose. Wouldn&#x27;t it be better if we had actual surveillance video of what happened in the Trayvon Martin or Michael Brown cases? Do you believe that constantly being monitored in that fashion would increase police abuses of power?<p>In a broader sense, most of the responses to my comment illustrate the very phenomenon that I&#x27;m describing: i.e., an instinctive defense of &quot;privacy&quot; in the abstract instead of a detailed analysis of the costs and benefits of increasing transparency in specific circumstances.<p>I&#x27;m not faulting the authors. After all, I have raised this issue in a very broad sense, and so it&#x27;s only natural that they would reply in the same fashion. But the way that we seem to be talking past one another illustrates how difficult it is to have meaningful discussions about &quot;privacy.&quot;<p>If I could make three major points, they would be:<p>1. <i>The need to acknowledge the futility of restricting access to certain forms of data</i><p>Most privacy advocates cite benefits that do not correspond with the facts. For example, the government already has the power to tail individuals in public without a warrant and to watch everywhere that they go. Thus, a rogue operative committed to malfeasance has the ability to compromise the privacy of his target. We will never eliminate that power.<p>The question is, given its existence, would there be benefits to a more comprehensive surveillance system? More specifically, would the marginal benefits of broadening the system outweigh the attendant costs? In my opinion, there is a real debate to be had.<p>That is especially true in modern America, where we have essentially delegated unlimited surveillance powers to the government, subject only to legal restrictions on the purposes for which the collected information can be employed. Any actor willing to flout the law in order to pursue coercive goals will be able to summarily defeat the obstacles intended to deny access to the current fruits of state surveillance.<p>If anything, providing the NSA and other members of the intelligence community a monopoly on access to this information seems to increase the risks of misuse, by making it easier for a modern day J. Edgar Hoover to seize power by exploiting the asymmetry between his access to information and that of his foes within the government. I would be more comfortable in a society in which the state transparently employed the data it collects for worthwhile ends instead of pretending that it only uses it for narrow purposes like counter-terrorism.<p>2. <i>Not all data is created equal</i> When we talk about privacy, people naturally begin framing the debate in Orwellian terms. Isn&#x27;t it possible for us to approach this topic with more nuance?<p>For example, if we allowed the government to know which books we are reading (something the NSA already knows...), then political activism could be directly compromised, and the benefits would be limited. The same is not true of expanding public surveillance on city streets or highways, to give one example.<p>The problem with &quot;privacy&quot; in the abstract is that it simultaneously encompasses legitimate concerns and ones that cannot withstand scrutiny. Why is access to our medical information so privileged? Do we want to subsidize the livelihood of people with medical problems by artificially eliminating the ability of employers or insurance companies to take into account all of the available information?<p>The answer might well be yes! I certainly benefit from that policy judgment. But I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s the correct one, and I wish that we could enjoy an open debate about whether the gains in aggregate economic efficiency would outweigh the costs to individuals. At minimum, shouldn&#x27;t we explore alternatives like increasing social welfare payments for medically disadvantaged individuals while simultaneously allowing information about their medical histories to improve the accuracy of public and private decision-making? Maybe that approach wouldn&#x27;t work, but I have not even heard it discussed.<p>3. <i>Are we utilitarians or deontologists?</i> One of the major dividing lines in these discussions is an implicit disagreement over the appropriate moral calculus.<p>I default to consequentialism, so in my mind the foreseeable harms from criminality are equivalent to the potential for police abuse. Yet most people process the two in very different ways emotionally.<p>My well-being is threatened much more directly by criminal gangs than it is by an oppressive state. Only a few months ago, I nearly lost my life when I was attacked in an alley by two thugs.<p>Should I be forced to be a martyr for privacy when increased surveillance could have deterred their actions?",1442978218

Artists definitely care if someone steals their work, but you don&#x27;t usually hear about that happening because copyright exists. You know all the hubub about certain comedians stealing jokes from other comedians? That&#x27;s a realm with no copyright/patent equivalent.",1442977315

I&#x27;d like to use a classifier to determine whether or not an image contains the building - a simple yes/no label.<p>This seems like a job for machine learning, and I&#x27;m happy to manually train a model with up to a few hundred items, but I don&#x27;t know where I should start. I have some experience with text classification (e.g. TF-IDF, Levenshtein distance) but nothing in computer vision.<p>I&#x27;m happy to explore paid services for this, or to dive into something like scikit-learn if it&#x27;s appropriate.

5878574,comment,5877259,5878331,1,0,dnautics,,,"Did you actually read the patents?  For the most part, they are molecule patent, not a method patent[1].  And you can&#x27;t patent information, so your argument that &quot;they are informationally identical&quot; means very little, legally.  A DNA molecule is not an RNA molecule, so they would have to be covered under different claims in a molecule patent.<p>However, it is the use context which determines novelness of the molecule, which is why the myriad DNA is novel - in the absence of any of the research, how would you have  picked that segment of DNA to amplify by PCR in order to test for an enhanced risk for breast cancer?  So, that particular class of double stranded DNA molecule has a non-obvious use as a diagnostic tool.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how you made it, or that how to make it is &#x27;obvious&#x27;.  Let&#x27;s say you make a wooden machine that does something impressive that no one has thought of before.  Does it matter, that just by looking at it, the process to make it (say with a six-axis cutting tool) is obvious?  Of course not.<p>Your argument that the &quot;process&quot; is not novel is irrelevant, because molecule patents <i>don&#x27;t care about the process</i>.  Just as plant patents don&#x27;t care about the process (which for a long time was always the same, plant husbandry, crossing, and grafting).  So you shouldn&#x27;t conflate the requirements for a method patent with the requirements for a molecule patent.  The Myriad lawyers weren&#x27;t idiots - there was a reason why they filed these patents as a molecule patent.<p>That said, I happen to think the claims are overbroad, and that a molecule patent should probably adhere to some more careful standards as to what molecules, exactly, are and are not claimed, but the court case didn&#x27;t address that at all.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t agree that genes should be patented, but only in the context that I don&#x27;t believe in patents <i>at all</i>.  But, if we have a patent system with the laws as they are now, I think the myriad patents are valid.  Moreover, I think that the supreme court is overstepping its bounds in its declaration because what it is doing (determining patentable classes) is the function of Congress.  However, I don&#x27;t think what the supreme court is doing is wrong (beyond my general moral objection to patents) because if their faulty understanding of the underlying science were to be correct, then what they did would NOT be determining patentable classes outside of the already-established rubric.<p>[1] there is a method in there, which amounts to &quot;take a patient sequence and compare it to Craig Venter (reference sequence)&quot;.  IIRC, because this method of diagnosis is clearly obvious, this is not at issue in this case, as it has been rejected and unchallenged.",1371191586

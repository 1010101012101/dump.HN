This is literally what they&#x27;re saying: &quot;You know, we can&#x27;t say for certain; perhaps at that time dropping the landline was in effect risky behavior.&quot;<p>That doesn&#x27;t really compute to me. My 80 year old grandparents have been cell phone only for about 5 years, because it&#x27;s just as cheap as a landline and they can call from anywhere. Same with my 60 year old parents. It makes them feel safer to be able to call from the car in case their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. These are very conservative people. They own their house. They&#x27;ve had the same jobs for a decade+. They don&#x27;t smoke. They drink moderately. The riskiest thing they do in any given day is drive to work. Granted, this is n=1, but I can name about half a dozen other households who are about the same in a very conservative rural area who have also dropped their land lines.",1449424663

(peak dates may cost a total of $800 and the reasonable monthly might be $1600 but host wants $800 + $1600 or something like that - ridiculous) Peak dates are about 10 days from Dec 22nd - Jan 1st or something.

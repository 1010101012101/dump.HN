That we should not argue (&quot;whine&quot;) because we might be wrong?<p>Also, how come you only list other negative attitudes to things that are either still controversial or scientifically validated as probably harmless? How about asbestos, PCB, lots of CO2 in the atmosphere, the Stasi?<p>Also, are you arguing that we only ever should take action when the end results are in, never because of predictions, because those might be wrong? Or are you saying that all degrees of uncertainty are the same unless zero, and essentially equivalent to total uncertainty?<p>Seriously, I don&#x27;t get what you are actually trying to tell me.",1389146392

And how often would you miss reading something interesting because it didn&#x27;t fit in one of your &#x27;buckets&#x27;.<p>To me, one of the great things about HN is that I get exposed to articles I wouldn&#x27;t normally find. I wouldn&#x27;t have learned about Dart if I only looked at articles about Rails, I wouldn&#x27;t have found an article that pointed to a solution to an algorithm problem I&#x27;ve been struggling with, if I didn&#x27;t look at [PYTHON] articles (or one article in particular).<p>Lots of people have been commenting regularly about the quality of HN slipping, and I don&#x27;t mean to pick on you, but it starts with changing every person, just a little bit. I would have preferred you to post this as &quot;Ask HN: Does HN needs categories&quot;, and therefore, it becomes a discussion about the merits and challenges in creating categories. You&#x27;ve made a blanket statement assuming something is broken and that you have the solution, but not everybody agrees that the system is broken.<p>You&#x27;re also a new user, which is great, it&#x27;s great to have new users and great to see a new user become active right away. Great to have &#x27;beginners eyes&#x27; and get feedback on how new users feel on their first few experiences. However, it isn&#x27;t great as a beginner in any field to assume you know better than those who are more familiar with the product/community/whatever.<p>I think if we all had a bit more humility (and that isn&#x27;t just new users, but all users), HN comments (and posts sometimes) would be of greater benefit to the entire community.",1389146305

Cowardly companies that insisted on being able to pay support for anything they deployed were able to hand over $$$ to RedHat then tick the box of &#x27;support&#x27;. However, as we all know, you get a Linux user/expert to fix the server, you don&#x27;t call RedHat.<p>Due to the success of Ubuntu you have user/experts in small to medium sized companies that have &#x27;given Linux a go&#x27; and got some good experience of Ubuntu. They might prefer the Ubuntu ways of doing things, e.g. the &#x27;no root&#x27; security model, the modern, up to date packages (e.g. latest version of PHP), the ultra easy firewall and plenty else.<p>However, due to the perception that Red Hat is &#x27;enterprise&#x27; and that small to medium companies re cheapskate, the CentOS  rip-off gets specified by micro-managers because they have heard it is more &#x27;enterprisey&#x27;. &#x27;They know best&#x27; and go with the turgid CentOS regardless of whether any developers on the team would prefer something else.<p>You then have a lot of hosting companies pushing CentOS because they think it is more &#x27;enterprisey&#x27; and what their customers want. Non-technical managers listen to them and then blame their team for any server problems.<p>Sure, if you know your way around Red Hat it is the greatest thing since Windows 3.0, you can get it to do what you want just fine. But, actually, if you are not an expert yet then very little about Red Hat is obvious. Far too many answers to common problems are guesswork in forum answers that you come across. Furthermore any serious claim to better security goes out the window as soon as you add random repositories that you might need just to get your work done.<p>Red Hat has had its day. CentOS has been a mere rip off of Red Hat and it has not added to the state of the art. I know it has its fans but I wish it would just go away.",1389146280

[...] American forces had scooped up Ibn Sheikh al-Libi in Afghanistan in November, 2001, and sent him off to Egypt to be tortured (because the US itself doesn’t do torture) in the presence of American interrogators.

Saturated fats are quite safe, however large single sitting intakes are a bad idea because of increased endotoxin absorption. Monounsaturated fats are probably fine, but other unsaturated fats accumulate in tissues over time and cause disease. DHA is implicated in alzheimers. PUFAs, including omega-3, are tied to cancer and metabolic disorders. Even the so-called essential fatty acids are understood to interfere with the endocrine system over time.<p>Coconut oil and dairy fat are safe. Other fats should really be minimized.

When it gets to the core, fusion occurs in a halo around the neutron star instead of through the normal sort of fusion you&#x27;d get in a Red Giant core. This leads to a different ratio of nuclear isotopes, which is how you can determine these objects aren&#x27;t typical Red Giants.<p>The resulting objects survive around 70 million years before the neutron star core absorbs enough mass to turn into a black hole (one of the other linked papers in this thread had some discussion on how long they might be stable). However, the predicted rate of birth/death of these objects indicates there may be a few of these in the galaxy at any given time.",1389143367

7021076,comment,7020212,7020955,9,0,laumars,,,"I&#x27;ve been using KDE for years. I can&#x27;t remember exactly how long, but I vaguely recall getting excited about a magazine which had KDE2 on it&#x27;s cover disc, so I must have been using it since the later versions of 1.<p>Some stuff that I like about KDE4 are (in no particular order):<p>o Dolphin - it&#x27;s a fantastic file manager which has all the features you&#x27;d expect from a powerful modern file manager yet in a clean and uncluttered interface. Yet everything is easy locate and enable as and when I need<p>o Unified / Integrated components - I can be running Dolphin and hit [F4] and a Konsole terminal pane will attach to the bottom of the file manager; already cd&#x27;ed to the directory I&#x27;m browsing. And as it&#x27;s KDE Konsole, all of my profiles et al from the standalone terminal emulator will be available.<p>o Taskbar - while I might dislike Windows as an OS (personal preference; not trying to start a flamewar), I do think the taskbar was a stroke of genius. The Windows taskbar peaked at Windows 2000 / XP (minus the themes). The KDE taskbar has the same clean layout that I liked from Windows 2000.<p>o KWin Compositing - I used to dislike KWin and much prefer Compiz, and in many ways Compiz is still probably preferable. But these days KWin is actually pretty decent on it&#x27;s own; which is handy because I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of time to spend making a computer look pretty. So it&#x27;s nice to have an &quot;out of the box&quot; solution that comes with KDE4 rather than having to install lots of additional glitter manually.<p>o Krunner - [F2] then type any application or document name and it pops up. Hugely convenient.<p>o Configuration - I work as a Linux and UNIX systems administrator by trade, so sometimes I just can&#x27;t be bothered to configure things the &quot;proper&quot; way if I just need to quickly add a printer to CUPS (for example). KDE comes with some pretty decent control panel applets for desktop administration. Though I really dislike how they&#x27;ve grouped the items in System Settings - which makes it just as counter intuitive to find items as it is in Windows Control Panel when you&#x27;re unfamiliar with Windows.<p>o Snap Regions - I know most WMs support that these days, but it was less common when that feature was released in KDE4.0 (or at least that&#x27;s what I seem to recall. I might be wrong about that).<p>o Sane defaults - for the most part, I find I don&#x27;t have to do much to make KDE usable.<p>I know most of what I&#x27;ve described can be done in other WM/DEs, but I&#x27;ve always just felt at home in KDE. Maybe part of it is just because I&#x27;ve been using it for so many years on so many different distros (SuSE, Arch, Mandrake, Slackware, etc) or maybe it&#x27;s because many of the distros I&#x27;ve ran on my desktop have been KDE-centric (eg SuSE, Slackware) or at last been one of the few to do decent packages for KDE (I&#x27;m still not convinced KDE4 on Kubuntu isn&#x27;t total garbage where as Arch seems to suit KDE well). But KDE just feels like home.<p>The only other environment I&#x27;ve felt comfortable in was Awesome, which, weirdly, is the polar opposite of KDE. Most of the other DE&#x27;s look pretty but I&#x27;m quickly bored of them (which I&#x27;m guessing is exactly how you and many others feel about KDE4?)<p>As for if I discovered Linux today; who knows what I&#x27;d be using. Probably Awesome because I&#x27;d want to think of myself as &quot;l33t&quot;.<p>Good luck with your DE/WM project by the way. That&#x27;s quite a daunting project you&#x27;ve taken on - but I can imagine it&#x27;ll be great fun too.",1389143211

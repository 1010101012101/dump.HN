8570706,comment,8566710,8570432,0,0,BruceM,,,"This is something that can be readily solved. Dylan has no issues in this area when using the MPS (<a href=""http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/</a>) GC.<p>There are a few things that are worth taking note of though ...<p>One is that things that use addresses in memory need to be able to deal with those addresses changing. An example of this are common implementations of hash tables (due to hashing using the address). MPS provides location dependencies (<a href=""http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/manual/html/topic/location.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/manual/html/top...</a>) to deal with this.<p>Another is that when you call into C / foreign code, you want to be able to pin your object down so that it won&#x27;t move. This is commonly an issue with byte vectors / strings.  For that, the language / libraries / compiler should support pinning and unpinning objects. The way that Dylan does this in the native code generator is that it makes sure there&#x27;s a stack reference to the object which is enough for the GC to not move it. This is only good for short-lived things though as you don&#x27;t want to disrupt GC for too long.<p>Another thing to take note of is that you sometimes want to store an object reference in native code and out of reach of the GC. A common situation where this happens is storing user data or callbacks. In this situation, we can register a Dylan object to have a handle which we can pass to native code.  With this, we register the object, then export it to get a handle, we pass the handle to native code. When we get a handle from native code, we import it to get back to the original Dylan object (which may have moved). We can unregister it when we&#x27;re all done.<p><pre><code>    register-c-dylan-object(handle);\n    %uv-handle-data(handle.raw-handle) := export-c-dylan-object(handle);\n\n    ...\n\n    let handle = import-c-dylan-object(%uv-handle-data(raw-handle));\n    apply(handle.callback, args)\n</code></pre>\nThese are all solved problems. They can be a bit tedious and sometimes error prone, but nothing that can&#x27;t be solved.  It might be adventurous to migrate an existing community that wasn&#x27;t prepared though.",1415321090

But yes, they are big challenges.<p>Here’s how it works:<p>(I think I’ve addressed all your points here, let me know if I missed anything)<p>Every product is structured as a partnership (similar to the way a law firm can be a partnership). Everyone who earns App Coins in that product is a partner – which entitles them to a portion of all profits in accordance with their ownership percentage, along with access to business information and direct involvement in decision-making. Those profits are paid out as royalties, not dividends. There are other differences from securities, for example, you can&#x27;t transfer ownership of Assembly products on a secondary market.<p>This solution is the best balance we’ve found so far.<p>Products built on Assembly live on Assembly (so that we can protect the interests of anyone in the community who helped build them). So, revenue is collected by Assembly, the bills are paid, and profits are distributed to all partners (all of this is fully transparent). So, Assembly takes care of financial reporting and products don&#x27;t need to worry about things like LLCs and DBAs.<p>Dilution occurs anytime that work is awarded, and a rogue Core Team might be able to game the system to their advantage, but we have reasonable protections in place to prevent this happening to an extreme.<p>I’d love to chat about this more if I haven’t covered all your questions.

It sounds like I pretty much went through the  same thought process as you when I started. I didn&#x27;t know where to find work immediately either. What I found out quickly though, is sites like freelancer.com help in no way to providing a reasonable amount of work at a good rate consistently. In fact just the nature of them are geared towards 2nd/3rd world devs/designers that are able to get a good return relative to their lifestyle costs. Which you can&#x27;t compete with. Starting out I had great success going to meetups where people might need my services. Eg. Small Business meetups. Once you walk in the door you will find that non-technical people have great difficulty meeting and finding the right designer/developer for their websites, apps, projects, etc.<p>The other bonus is you have met face to face and from a sales perspective you will have far more success in converting people to work with you.<p>This has been one of the ways I have successfully managed to get work, consistently. It certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt.<p>Cheers,\nMarkus<p><a href=""http://mstrazds.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mstrazds.com/</a>",1415320373

8570554,comment,8562358,8567605,0,0,jonsterling,,,"There are two lenses through which you can looked at typed computation, intrinsic and extrinsic. From the extrinsic perspective (which I actually prefer for semantical reasons), you are classifying the terms of a computation system which are already endowed with an operational semantics; in this sense, you are constraining computation. But I prefer to use the term &quot;classify&quot; rather than &quot;constrain&quot;; in systems built on this kind of theory, like Nuprl, for instance, you can give a type to any kind of computation you want, even the kinds that are typically ruled out in type theory (such as partiality).<p>The intrinsic perspective is where the computations and the types are inextricably linked. This is the proof-theoretic, gentzen-style way to look at it. In this case, it is harder to say that you are constraining computation; and in many systems in the intrinsic typing tradition, it is a lot more about inferring computation than constraining it.<p>However, do not go and think that the extrinsic perspective is &quot;lifeless&quot;. I would say that it is the opposite, since this is the result of taking seriously the realizability-style semantics which underly the entire intuitionistic notion of Truth as understood by Brouwer and others. I consider the Curry-Howard Correspondence (the identification of program with proof) to be lifeless, in the sense that nothing is really happening there, since the programs are literally proofs of judgement in a formal system; but the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov correspondence, which is similar, is much more interesting--this is the classification of computations as <i>witnesses/realizers</i> for propositions.<p>Intensional type theory is a theory of formal proof, where the terms are literally proofs of judgement: it&#x27;s pretty dead in there. Type theory based on realizability, though, is more interesting, since the computations exist on their own and we categorize them as the essential computational content of propositions.<p>Once you go down the rabbit hole, what seems lifeless now may not then. Though based on what you have said about algorithm design, it is entirely possible that we simply have very different aesthetics for theories.<p>If you are interested in reading further, I wrote something here: <a href=""http://www.jonmsterling.com/posts/2014-10-29-proof-term-assignments-and-intuitionistic-truth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jonmsterling.com/posts/2014-10-29-proof-term-assi...</a>.

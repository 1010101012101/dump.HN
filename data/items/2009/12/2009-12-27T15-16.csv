This is a very advanced pattern matching system that's far more powerful than the one in O'Caml/Haskell.<p>Pattern matching tries to find values for the variables in a formula such that the formula produces some value. For example if we define:<p><pre><code>    type list = Pair(int,list) | Empty

    case v of
      Pair(n, rest) -> ...
      Empty -> ...
</code></pre>
Now the pattern matcher tries to find values for n and rest such that the expression `Pair(n,rest)` evaluates to `v`.<p>JMatch extends this in several ways: it lets you define your own pattern matchers, and it extends pattern matching to cases when there are <i>multiple</i> ways of binding the variables.<p>If we have `lst = [1,2,3]` then the pattern `x in lst` has multiple solutions: `x=1, x=2` and `x=3`. Similarly the pattern `x in lst && y in lst && x <= y` has 6 solutions. You can iterate over the solutions of a pattern:<p><pre><code>    foreach(x in lst && y in lst && x <= y){ ... }
</code></pre>
In general you can have<p><pre><code>    foreach(<boolean formula>) {...}
</code></pre>
given that you have defined pattern matchers for calls in the boolean formula.<p>Iterating over the indices/values of an array:<p><pre><code>    foreach(x == arr[i]){ print(i); print(x); }
</code></pre>
This iterates over all values of x and i such that `x == arr[i]` is true.<p><i>syntax slightly simplified (& types omitted) in examples</i><p>Check out page 8 of [<a href=""http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/jmatch/jmatch.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/jmatch/jmatch.pdf</a>].

The paragraph you quoted (implied as a representative sample) is indeed pretty much content-free, because it was a gratuitous flourish at the end.<p>Of course there is indeed a lot of assertion couched in flowery language there, but that's not the same as ""because I say so and if you disagree you're a poopyhead"" which is what you seem to have gotten from it. You also seemed to miss the part where he argued that multiple major concepts in modern software originated on the Lisp Machine, which would seem to more than qualify as ""building something better"".<p>I'm assuming you're not naive enough to think that ""better"" equates to ""successful"", which is another issue entirely.",1261928927

I really feel like I've learned some valuable insights into technology, business, science, and so many other topics from you. And attending this recent Startup school was probably the turning point for me, when I resolved to make something that people want to use, that people love.<p>I've always been really interested in music. I played bass and drums for years growing up, though between you and I, I never managed to develop a good sense of rhythm. My older brother was seemingly infinitely talented in every instrument he touched, and played in local bands for years. Of course I was jealous.<p>It's been a long time since those days, but I've finally settled on my contribution to the music scene. It's a music distribution service that bands and musicians can sign up for. Nothing too different so far, however, instead of the status quo of a ~70% return on album sales to the musician, we're targeting 90%. We're also going to donate <i>most</i> of that other 10% to the Save the Music Foundation for the first six months, and 1% for each month afterwards, as long as the service is alive and kicking. We like to call it music distribution with a conscience.<p>I really don't plan to make (a ton of) money off of this site, or quit my day job, which I'm hoping will help differentiate us from the competition. The business infrastructure behind music is showing signs of aging, inefficiency, etc, etc, and the vision here is to show how simple and efficient music distribution can be, and (hopefully) that it pays to put the musician first.<p>Anyway, I should probably give you the link so you can tell me how beta my beta service is. In case you haven't gathered so far, it's pretty solidly in the beta category. And by beta, I mean it should all work but is still facing some big development efforts:<p>http://bonmp3.com/<p>Thanks HN!",1261928116

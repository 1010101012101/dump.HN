Now we 17.78/2 = 8.89 C = 282.04 kelvin. That is suspiciously close the to 0 C = 273.15 K- however it is also not that close. My whole understanding of temperature has been flip upside down.<p>Wait. This is why I am not an engineer. If we add a glass of liquid that is at 0C/32F/273K to another glass of liquid that is at 0C/32F/273K the temperature will still be 0C/32F/273K. A better way to measure this would be in energy/joules gained/lost- we would also need volume, properties, ect. In this case we are trying to lower 0C by adding 0C. Since the water is already at 0C then there is no energy needed. You about blew my mind; I've never thought of temperature as a number line.<p><a href=""http://www.physicsforums.com/archive/index.php/t-185960.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.physicsforums.com/archive/index.php/t-185960.html</a><p><a href=""http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/64505.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/64505.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.essex1.com/people/speer/heat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.essex1.com/people/speer/heat.html</a><p>My next project will definitely have to be a temperature/volume/energy converter",1282031918

1610546,comment,1609703,1610164,0,0,10ren,,,"Computer science seems actually to be the exception. Yes, though the insight could have been had earlier, it somehow wasn't. And this is common in computer science. I now attempt to support this thesis.<p>Even the stereotypical ""impractical"" research algorithms (with efficient  complexity but huge constants) are <i>implemented</i>. That's the magic of computer science, that you can breath life into abstract ideas.
But if you cannot implement it at all, there are millions of other cool ideas that you can implement, so you may gravitate towards them.
(another argument is that if you can't implement it, it's classed as pure maths. And if you can't prove it, or define it clearly as a conjecture, I'm not sure what it is or what you could do with it - perhaps futurism/science fiction, which has its place.)<p>The value of implementation is due to computer science ideas tending to be complex and abstract - but once you have an actual concrete working model that you can play with, they can become almost trivial to understand. And so, comparatively, more progress in research is made based on working code than on purely theoretical ideas. It's so <i>much</i> easier to find mistakes in an idea if you can build it. And once your theory is embodied in living, working code, it's tremendously easier to reason from that as a base; much as it is easier to see what is over the next hill after climbing it.<p>Hardware is closer to your idea of incentive: the inventor of the Wallace tree multiplier told me that it was a simple and obvious idea, but it wasted a lot of silicon; and no one entertained that kind of waste. It simply wasn't conceivable. Perhaps this is due to the incredible rate of improvement in silicon (Moore's Law), so that it's psychological difficult to appreciate (or even believe) that your iPhone will be 1000 times faster in 15 years; or what changes that even means for algorithms. Perhaps the most basic assumptions of the algorithm changes? When x10 quantitative improvement often translates into a qualitative improvement, what does a x1000 change mean? Too hard to predict.",1282031876

1610537,comment,1608923,1610266,0,0,SkyMarshal,,,"I know there were extensive plans for an invasion of the Japanese mainland, real plans not just hypothetical ones, because at the time no one was sure what the effects and consequences of the atomic bomb would be, even after its tests in the US southwest and South Pacific.<p>My apartment mate is Army officer whose job is to plan for literally <i>every</i> eventuality - it's what the military does, or tries to.  In the case of WWII, not planning a detailed invasion of Japan would have been unfathomable, even if they fully knew the military and political effects and consequences of the atomic bombs.<p>Which they didn't.  I'm pretty sure a few did - the inventors of the thing for one - but it was still too unprecedented and game-changing at the time to be able to annihilate an entire modern city with a single bomb, and no general was going to risk the war and his career throwing all his eggs into the nuke basket when it was only marginally more difficult to have his staff draw up plans for a full scale invasion as well.  Why do one when you can do both?  Hence all the standard invasion plans and expectations.<p>But I'm also pretty sure that Hiroshima and Nagasaki quickly invalidated those plans, because they were based on a prior understanding of the world and of wars that had also become invalidated by the atomic bomb.  Had Japan not surrendered after the first two, I'd bet anything that the US would have simply continued to drop nukes on the island until they finally cried Uncle, instead of actually invading, after realizing how easy it was to slaughter hundreds of thousands of Japanese with next to zero risk for US forces.<p>My point is, the nukes changed the entire calculus of warfare, and did so at the last minute in late 1944 and 1945, and though extensive, documented, official plans had been drawn up to invade Japan, they were invalided by Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  There's no way the US would have invaded Japan once they saw how easy it was to simply annihilate the place with a single plane and bomb.<p>Try this thought experiment:  In the history that actually happened, two things occured - the Soviets defeated the Japanese Manchurian Army and at roughly the same time the US nuked Japanese mainland, and shortly afterward Japan unconditionally surrendered.  Now imagine two alternate histories:<p>1) The US fails to invent the atomic bomb, and moves to stage a full scale invasion of the Japanese mainland, while the Soviets still defeat the Japanese Manchurian Army as actually happened.<p>...and...<p>2) The US invents the atomic bomb and drops it on Hiroshima and Nagasaki as actually happened, but Soviet military failed to organize on their Eastern border, never attacked much less defeated the Japanese military there, and never threatened their hold on Manchuria.<p>Which of those two do you think would more likely have led to Japan surrendering as it did in our actual history?",1282031516

Figure out what sort of programs you want to write, then search on that to see what others use. There'll be overlap, so look at the resources, figure out which seem to make the most sense to you, then pick the language that matches.<p>At first, your choice of language isn't all that critical so long as you start out with some resources you've turned up that'll let you get some of those first projects completed. Then you'll be good enough at formulating ideas then implementing them to make a more informed choice. Either you'll be comfortable enough with your chosen language's idiom to solve problems even if they don't necessarily align with the language's strengths, or you'll have a better basis to pick a new language that addresses your problems with the first language. After some initial discomfort, if you've picked well the new language will start to feel handy and expressive in a short while.<p>Any of the major languages can be taken on by the new programmer, I usually recommend one of Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Java, or Groovy. The resources for beginners are good, the user communities are supportive, and they're all expressive enough to create powerful programs.<p>There are lots of other good languages--no knocks on them--these are just my favorites presently.

1610526,comment,1606019,1609691,0,0,abdulhaq,,,"Your mistake here is thinking that if something is not against the shariah then it must be 'promoting' shariah. That's incorrect.
In Islam, everything is allowed (halal) unless it is clearly disallowed (haram), so someone administering a shariah compliant loan only needs to establish that it is not for the purposes of e.g. gambling, prostitution, the alcohol industry etc. If your business is to sell pet food then there would be no problem with that. You don't have to 'promote' shariah to get a loan.
Frankly, it's bordering on the absurd to say that shariah-compliant banking (if you find any that really is genuinely compliant, let me know by the way, I can't find one to buy a house) is 'stealth jihad' but again that reinforces my point that the lack of knowledge the west (particularly Americans) has about Islam is scary and makes it so easy for those with a vested interest in war to keep the ball rolling.",1282031056

1610518,comment,1610083,1610083,0,0,photon_off,,,"The amazing and terrible thing about programming is that you can learn enough about it without physical contact with another human being.  I suspect that content about programming on the web shows a huge bias towards being technology based -- if you considered all the possible topics and ideas in the world and their popularity, the ratio of popularity-on-the-internet to popularity-IRL is probably highest with technology and programming.  Well, you'd have to exclude porn and other taboo topics for which the anonymity aspect of the internet, rather than information sharing aspect, causes their ratio to explode.<p>That was a bit of a tangent.  My original thought was that there are several thousand lifetimes worth of programming knowledge online, and it's getting more and more organized by the minute.  Google and StackOverflow will be your best friends.  It may take you some time to learn how to ask the question, but beyond that you should be able to find solutions to any problem that you run up against.<p>With this in mind, it's important that you actively apply that knowledge.  Learning is one thing, doing is quite another.  I've often times postulated to myself that there's probably some optimal ratio of studying vs. doing, in all things.  Then, I realize there's more to it than that -- there's the context switching.  If you spend 5 years learning, then 5 years doing, you'll never learn as much as if you spend 1 day learning and 1 day doing for 10 years straight.  Learning and doing feed off of each other.<p>So, learn and do.  Find something you really want to work on, and try to build it.  When you run up against a wall, which you most definitely will, it's time to learn.  Once you're ready to give it a shot, do it.  When things start getting too complicated, you're probably doing it wrong.  Start over, make things ""cleaner"" (this becomes a 6th sense after awhile), and you'll find yourself naturally creating patterns that you become comfortable with.  Like any other skill, it's really a pleasure to see your abilities progress.<p>Have fun.",1282030766

There are two projects which I'm running in my not-paid-for spare time: starting a Product Managers association in SA and a 'Netflix' for books.<p>South Africa doesn't have great access to books (expensive) and the public reading infrastructure is poor. I believe you are what you read and for our people to grow and develop, we need inexpensive access to <i>top</i> reading material and hence I started the John Galt Library: www.johngaltlibrary.com. One of our niches is in the collection of software books I make available. If you're serious about software development there is a 'biblical' list one should read and I'm continuously investing in adding these books to the library.

I've really found a calling in it as a vocation and am gathering together other Product Managers and folk who perform product management functions in order that we can all learn from each other and collectively lift our game. Attending BoS is a definite product management skill enhancer which I intend to share with Product Managers in SA.<p>Why I can't come?

(Valid until 22nd August 2010)<p>Hi there. This is an online language course for Irish Gaelic. That's the native language we have in Ireland. It doesn't have that many daily speakers, but a surprising number of people abroad are interested in it.<p>I'm looking for your feedback on UX, content, lessons, audio, and anything else that comes to mind. You might even learn something about the language, but I'm sure I'll learn more from you!<p>Eoin",1282029632

I don&#x27;t <i>think</i> there is anyone gunning for war with North Korea (well, Northrup Grumman and Halliburton probably are, but I don&#x27;t believe our state is entirely owned by the defense industry anymore, as it was during the Bush years).

North Korea is led by angry, crazy, people. But, the early communication about the attack does not match that of a nation state, and there&#x27;s no reason for them to have tried to pretend to be a random blackmail organization that I can imagine.<p>In short, an IP is not a smoking gun. I worry that the FBI is taking advantage of people&#x27;s lack of understanding of technology in order to push a story that is politically convenient, but factually shaky.

At 24 hour intervals, the cultures were checked for growth. Cultures from the second highest concentrations that allowed growth (OD600≥2) were diluted 1:100 into fresh media containing 0.25xMIC, 0.5xMIC,1xMIC,2xMIC and 4xMIC of teixobactin. This serial passaging was repeated daily for 30 days. Any cultures that grew at higher than the MIC levels were passaged on drug free MHA plates and the MIC was then determined by broth microdilution. No resistant mutants were obtained. This experiment was repeated, and produced the same negative result. In order to maximize the chance of obtaining a resistant mutant, we performed an additional experiment with very small incremental increases in the drug concentration. Cells were added to a series of tubes with small differences in the concentration of teixobactin (0.06xMIC, 0.25xMIC, 0.5xMIC, 0.75xMIC,1xMIC, 1.25xMIC, 1.5xMIC, and 2xMIC).

Every hour or so, some clerk opens a safe full of USB sticks and takes one out?  Now you have an insider theft risk.  Did they copy one?  Who has physical access? If you&#x27;re operating 24/7, more than one person will need access.<p>A secure off-line &quot;cold wallet&quot; system is hard.  Physically, it looks like a collection of storage media.  Those devices need to be backed up.  But backing them up means making a copy of the private keys, which means the backup medium and the backup machine have a path into the funds.  How do you audit a cold-wallet device, short of sending the funds in it back to yourself?  Looking at it visually is useless, and reading it out exposes the keys to risk.<p>Some of these problems have known solutions from bank currency management operations. But some don&#x27;t. In currency management, you can count and recount bills.  You don&#x27;t have to worry whether some of them have been used and invalidated.  Bitcoins in some stored form are not like that. Just because you have a sealed plastic bag with a USB stick and a label that says &quot;1000 BTC, validated on 2013-04-21&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s still good.

Then you have to find the affine hull, find a base of the affine hull, project down etc. For all these steps you have to pay attention to the numerics etc. Not nice. So I think (working in mathematical optimization, but not on interior point methods) implementing a good interior point method is only considered easy because you usually don&#x27;t care about these ugly parts. The simplex algorithm is less problematic since the only ugly situation that (you could imagine) occur here is that the polyhedron has a non-trivial lineality space (thus has no vertices). But this can&#x27;t happen since at the beginning the simplex algorithm converts the polyhedron into A x = b, x >= 0^n form and this class of polyedra is pointed as you can prove easily.<p>Even in the nice case interior point methods are only nice as long as you are interested in the optimum value. As soon as you also want properties from polyhedral combinatorics for your solution (say: a feasible base), interior point methods become really ugly, especially if the face where the optimum value is attained is not just a vertex.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m working in mathematical optimization, but not on interior point methods.",1420663663

[P]police are 22 times as likely to be killed by nonblack civilians than nonblack civilians are to be killed by police.<p>I think this tells you everything you need to know. Police are <i>always</i> more likely to be killed by civilians than the other way around. This is probably as it should be, unfortunately. The police are highly trained and will typically strive for non-violent resolutions. The civilians they are interacting with, however, are sometimes criminals who are high, desperate, evil, or what have you.<p>Officers respond to this threat with far greater force when the threat is black, than when it is white. As the author explains, &quot;the juxtaposition suggests that the police respond far more defensively to blacks (a 1-to-6 homicide ratio) than to whites (a 1-to-22 homicide ratio). African-Americans would correctly perceive the police as three to four times quicker to pull a lethal trigger against them than against whites.&quot;<p>The article goes on:<p>> Police officers naturally take a different perspective. While blacks are 14% of the U.S. population, they account for 47% of killings of police<p>But this perspective is faulty. While the 6:1, 22:1 statistics naturally take into account the frequency of police-civilian contact, the latter 14:47 comparison does not. In other words, this latter statistic is likely due to the fact that police have a disproportionate amount of contact with African americans.

Italians, responding to this demand, developed pizzerias to meet American expectations. Delighted with their discovery of &quot;authentic&quot; Italian pizza, Americans subsequently developed chains of &quot;authentic&quot; Italian brick-oven pizzerias. Hence, Americans met their own reflection in the other and were delighted.&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>-- Stephen Jenkins (2002), &quot;Black ships, Blavatsky, and the Pizza effect: critical self-consciousness as a thematic foundation for courses in Buddhist studies&quot;, in Victor Sōgen Hori; Richard P.

8853148,comment,8852487,8852487,0,0,tokenadult,,,"A very interesting submission about the big medical news story of the day. The news suggests that we can all enjoy significant gains in finding effective treatments for dangerous infections. The era of antibiotics is probably not over yet, by a long way.<p>As noted in another comment, the underlying <i>Nature</i> article is up on the World Wide Web, [after edit:] and now shared to all of us by a subscriber who posted a subscriber&#x27;s-sharing link in this thread.[1] I searched for some other news stories about this preliminary research finding to link to others based on independent reporting as well as the authors&#x27; press release and the <i>Nature</i> article. I found a story in <i>Financial Times</i>[2] reporting, &quot;Teixobactin quickly kills Gram-positive bacteria, which are prominent in discussions of antibiotic resistance, including <i>Clostridium difficile,</i> <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus.</i><p>&quot;Neil Woodford, head of the antimicrobial resistance unit at Public Health England, commented:<p>&quot;&#x27;The rise in antibiotic resistance is a threat to modern healthcare as we know it, so this discovery could potentially help to bridge the ever increasing gap between infections and the medicines we have available to treat them.&#x27;<p>&quot;But Prof Woodford added: &#x27;Although it is a step forward, this new discovery would not be suitable for treating infections caused by <i>E. coli,</i> <i>Klebsiella</i> or other Gram-negative bacteria.&#x27;&quot;<p>The <i>Washington Post</i> reports,[3] &quot;But all good things must eventually come to an end.<p>&quot;&#x27;They didn&#x27;t find resistance in a couple of simple tests, so it won’t happen in a minute, but there is no compound on this planet that bacteria will not develop resistance to,&#x27; Said Richard Novick, an NYU Langone Medical Center professor who wasn&#x27;t involved in the study. &#x27;But it would certainly happen more slowly with this one.&#x27;<p>&quot;And unfortunately, the drug&#x27;s genius mechanism is also its biggest flaw. It can only target so-called gram-positive bacteria, like staph, strep, and TB, because they&#x27;re unprotected once their cell wall starts to break down. Gram-negative bacteria like <i>E. coli</i> and the organisms that cause many sexually transmitted infections have an outer membrane that Teixobactin can&#x27;t penetrate. That&#x27;s probably a safety mechanism built-in by the gram-negative bacteria that created Teixobactin in the first place.&quot;<p>That expert also comments that he would strictly limit application of this antibiotic at first to hospital settings, and that would be my policy recommendation too, to reduce the chance of producing selection pressure for resistant strains of bacteria. But this does look like it could be a big advance in clinical treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections resistant to other antibiotics.<p>The reporting in <i>The Scientist</i>,[4] already linked by an earlier participant, includes a comment on the laboratory technique used to find the microorganism that produces this new antibiotic: &quot;&#x27;This is a very clever technique,&#x27; added Robert Austin, a physicist at Princeton University who studies the evolution of microbes and was not involved in the current study. &#x27;The bacteriology community needs to get away from culturing bacteria on agar plates, because this will not lead to new antibiotics.&#x27;&quot; That&#x27;s a familiar principle in science: look in a new place, and make new discoveries.<p>The reporting in <i>The Guardian</i>[5] picks up on that idea in the words of another expert: &quot;&#x27;What most excites me is the tantalising prospect that this discovery is just the tip of the iceberg,&#x27; said Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh. &#x27;It may be that we will find more, perhaps many more, antibiotics using these latest techniques.&#x27;&quot;<p>It&#x27;s very likely that there are more antibiotics yet to be discovered, because all microorganisms live in a world full of other microorganisms, and haphazard adaptation to that environment must have produced selection pressure for many microorganisms to produce natural chemicals (&quot;antibiotics&quot;) that kill off other kinds of microorganisms. Putting those chemicals into human bodies applies human knowledge to take advantage of the variety of life that has arisen from evolution.<p>[1] <a href=""http://rdcu.be/bVbR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rdcu.be/bVbR</a><p>&quot;A new antibiotic kills pathogens without detectable resistance&quot;   <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature14098.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/natu...</a><p>DOI: 10.1038/nature14098<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/701a3c36-95be-11e4-a390-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3OAXfp1y4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/701a3c36-95be-11e4-a390-00144...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/01/07/new-class-of-antibiotic-found-in-dirt-could-prove-resistant-to-resistance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/20...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/41850/title/New-Antibiotic-from-Soil-Bacteria/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/41850/...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/07/antibiotic-drug-resistance-teixobactin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/07/antibiotic-dr...</a>",1420663106

We&#x27;re making them do something to survive that we didn&#x27;t before, and it&#x27;s going to come at a cost.<p>If we think of them like cars--armoured ones are extremely rare. However, if we started randomly shooting at cars, and did so for a protracted period, we would eventually see them become more common. The fact they&#x27;re slower, don&#x27;t turn as well, and use more fuel is now negligible because of the excessive benefit of it&#x27;s contents not being shredded.<p>If the implementation of this new antibiotic came with a moratorium on the prescription of penicillin, then we would be targeting the population as a whole with an RPG. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re armoured against bullets anymore. Both the normal and the resistant will be put under the identical survival pressures, which should mean it is more effective against the resistant strains as these won&#x27;t be as fast to replicate.<p>The problem from what I understand is that tackling antibiotic resistant drugs with drugs designed for antibiotic bacteria, just makes super bugs.<p>Essentially if we cleared the roads of regular cars and left ourselves with armoured cars, and then start firing RPGs at them, we&#x27;ll end up with vehicles resistant to those. We will end up with APC&#x27;s on the road.<p>If we implemented a moratorium on penicillin strain antibiotics, we could potentially reverse the current epidemic of multi-drug resistant strains. It would be like starting anew - assuming there&#x27;s no genes that are equally beneficial against both drugs.<p>That&#x27;s my understanding of the reasoning behind suggesting broad use, but I could be way off.",1420662988

This was done through a combination of macro, reader macro and CLOS MetaObject Protocol abuse, allowing us to achieve a faithful rendition of Dylan&#x27;s syntax and object system semantics respectively.<p>When Dylan went from prefix to infix syntax the reader macro indirection got all the more elaborate: what started out as a trivial reader macro that treated colons differently started delegating to a full-blown lex & yacc style parser instead.<p>All the better, most of this was achieved modularly: Lisp editor buffers and Lisp listeners would run happily alongside Dylan editor buffers and Dylan listeners, Lisp code could still compile load and run alongside Dylan code, and Lisp classes could interoperate cleanly with Dylan classes.<p>There&#x27;s no question that Common Lisp and its predecessors are some of the most formidably adaptable and hackable programming environments ever created. Only Smalltalk really comes close, and they have complementary strengths I think. Standard macros, reader macros and a comprehensive MOP are some of the key things that stand out in Common Lisp&#x27;s favour in that hackability comparison.",1420662649

They haven&#x27;t found any protein to which it binds, and they think it binds to an &quot;Achilles&#x27;s heel&quot; in the outer cell wall.  The method described to generate resistance was their most extreme attempt, so I assume they tried the fast way, and I can see why it didn&#x27;t work.<p>Ecologically, they believe there&#x27;s little gene (e.g. plasmid) transfer between these soil bacteria and human pathogens, and the &quot;30 year&quot; bit came from experience with vancomycin, to which it has a lot of similarity.

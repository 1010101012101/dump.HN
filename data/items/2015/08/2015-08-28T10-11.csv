Firstly the &quot;mixed-collar&quot; marriages in the article refer to educated vs uneducated individuals, lower classes especially in the US are much less likely to achieve college or higher education, in Europe with few exceptions (cough UK cough) it&#x27;s not an issue.<p>But in Europe it&#x27;s going to be just the same the chances of some one with say graduate or doctoral degree being in a long term relationship some one without a similar degree is fairly low.<p>People meet at school at in work, they usually have social interactions with their peers, and most importantly educated people prefer to date other educated people because they are more likely to share interests, world views, and could hold a conversation with each other.<p>And as far as true &quot;collar&quot; difference goes than you need only too look at old money families all those &quot;new age aristocrats&quot; while they might &quot;sleep around with the help&quot; they usually don&#x27;t mix with others especially in countries where familial history is very important like the UK.",1440759470

All other stuff you&#x27;ve mentioned are just things that happen in real life. Real life once again leaks to the Internet - stop the presses!<p>As for harassment: its the REAL PROBLEM. But 4chan is guilty no more that Internet in general. Harassment campaigns are happening all the time and even lack of anonymity is not preventing such behaviour. Tim Hunt and Matt Taylor were ripped apart by crowds at Twitter, Tumblr, main stream media publications. People were driven to suicide by harassment on Facebook (and those cases landed in courts).<p>There are shitty people who love being offended, being angry about some very subjective injustice; dignified agitation gives those people reason to breathe and makes them feel good. Internet brings those people together and helps them validate their own agitation and actions. Next they gang up. Its simple as that.

If not for biology, which causes us to make irrational decisions (in a sane world, would anyone torture themselves by having a kid and dumping $245000 on something. It simply is not a good investment), nobody would be having any kids. Kids are a massive emotional, psychological and monetary burden. I caused stress and tension to my parents.

From what I can gather they keep things extremely simple (jQuery, mostly) and make extensive use of pjax and server generated javascript that gets evaluated by the client. If this is all there is to it then it is really impressive, considering how many other companies of similar or smaller size quickly inject a Javascript MVC on top of their stack the minute the interaction goes past simple forms (Airbnb comes to mind, who to my knowledge is using Backbone for some aspects of their app).<p>To be clear I think both approaches are excellent and all depends on the in-house talent, but nonetheless it&#x27;s interesting to see how GitHub is sticking to a traditional, Rails-inspired document-based approach that minimizes front end complexity while other companies do not, even when both have similar UX complexity.",1440756296

In the event that the driver is busy, they generally forward the business to a trusted friend. It&#x27;s pretty hard to compete with free, personally reputation-audited referrals and 24 hour service.<p>Further, only certain cities have functional traffic: Chengdu being a prime example. Many Chinese cities&#x27; road networks have been so oversubscribed by the millions of new cars that have appeared in the last half decade or so that calling someone to pick you up is a physically impossible model during large portions of the day.<p>Yet another source of competition are e-bike or e-trike taxis, which have a few hundred dollar entry cost, hang around on many city corners, are totally unregulated and generally faster and cheaper (5-15元 = $1-3) than regular taxis (due to lack of road space).<p>I am skeptical Uber can generate any profits whatsoever in this market.",1440756264

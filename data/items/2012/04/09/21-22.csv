Yr right, point taken.<p>> I think the odds of such a contribution being well received are quite low given the hostility to that notion the developers of yesod still display.<p>Hostility I've never encountered.  I think the Yesod is super welcoming contribs (the recent discussion on pipes/conduits being a great example of that).<p>> Given that I can't see any benefit to using yesod, it seems like a waste of time for me to contribute an unwanted template engine to it.<p>Do you mean ""can't see any benefit to using yesod"" over using Snap?  Because I see quite a bunch of benefits in that comparison.  Let me name the ones I perceive as benefits:<p>* More type-safe<p>* Write less code to get it done (using template haskell and quasiquoting -- in other general terms they are ""small DSLs"")<p>* More vibrant community<p>* Faster (Warp is screaming fast)<p>* More like Rails (yups this is an advantage to me as I quite liked Rails for some reasons that Yesod seems to copy)",1334008689

3819446,comment,3817648,3819307,2,0,epistasis,,,"Ah, I see what you're saying. Though even going with the best treatment in the nearest match is a huge leap forward over what we can currently do. I see two ways forward, using the current class of chemotherapeutics + small molecule/antibody targetted therapies. As straw men, they are:<p>1) come up with a totally complete model of what everything in the cell does, how the mutations affect those interactions amongst gene products, and change the cell, and then designing some treatment to selectively kill that tumor population and to also block off obvious avenues to evolve resistance.<p>2) the ""dumb"" approach, figure out classes of disease, and try to use induction from the results of previous patients in that class of disease to figure out the best treatment for the current patient.<p>Right now both avenues are being pursued as best as possible. The first straw man is far from being approachable; we know so little about molecular biology, and when physics can't even figure out how to fold a protein, how are we going to be able to figure out changes to protein-protein binding dynamics, etc? Not that it can't be done eventually, but it's a very tough road.<p>The second approach is probably the best we can do now, and corresponds very well to the type of machine learning that is being researched these days. Even without full understanding of the biological system and the effects of all possible mutations, we can combine what we currently know with machine learning to construct a black-box for the parts of molecular biology that we don't yet know. I think that this is probably the most reasonable path forward for the time being, though we clearly need some intelligent way to guide studies into the combinatorial effect of targeted therapies.",1334008409

3819410,comment,3818046,3818934,7,0,NathanRice,,,"One significant issue is that most programming languages are inherently temporally inexpressive, having either full order (imperative/impure functional) or no order (purely functional).  Ideally the language would make it easy to organize statement in such a way that a programmer could indicate a partial ordering relation without having to use function composition. Additionally, a big problem with function composition in purely functional programming is that multiple long function compositions can only be ordered as monolithic units, however in many cases being able to order at the individual function level is desirable.  If a language had an explicit notion of relative temporal index for statements (which could be adjusted) it would be a nice win for writing concurrent code.  That would also let compiler writers lift a lot of the stuff they do up to the program source level as macros (which would be a HUGE win).",1334007803

I believe that on a practical level, to attempt to police abortion would require a Stasi amount of government effort.  If the people want the right to abort, the horse is already out of the barn, and the job is not the government's to swing the pendulum back, it belongs to magazine article writers, philosophers, and op-ed journalists. If they should fail, that's okay.  It is more important not to live <i>The Lives of Others</i> than to save those children's lives, simply because saving them would not represent a noble Arthurian quest, it would involve spying on pregnant women and assassinating doctors. Disgusting.<p>Intellectual property is a patently less important arena of human activity, but I think in a similar way the policing of the internet should be cultural.  There ought to be a cultural directive not to steal things over the internet when you're not a college kid anymore.  When you can afford something, and it's reasonably available, I think this cultural directive already exists.<p>This cultural approach is successful and that's the reason that -- for the most part -- torrenting and music sales are weakly correlated.  Most of the people that think it's okay to steal things, would not be customers anyhow.<p>I believe that most of the time torrenting represents charity on the part of movie studios and textbook publishers and music labels, providing their wares to those who would not have otherwise been able to afford them, which is not a bad thing, they're hiring cheap brand ambassadors. The ability to work subtle complicated questions like this one out is the power of cultural motivation.<p>TL;DR : When you're talking about the decision to terminate a pregnancy, or the decision to commit online piracy, the power is entirely in the hands of the citizen.  It is so easy to pirate, it is so distasteful to set a woman's body against her will. Law-abidingness in these cases requires the cooperation of the potential ""criminals"". You cannot pursue justice in these cases through traditional law enforcement.",1334007381

But since it is a relatively simple framework, you have to mix and match other packages to get the functionality that you want.<p>I found it as hard a Yesod to get it up and running.  Both suffer from old docs/tutorials/examples, both needed me to climb the daunting haskell learning curve.<p>> Yesod on the other hand is very elaborate - it contains a lot of functionality and relies fairly heavily on the use of Template Haskell and Quasi-Quoting.<p>How is that a problem?  I say: ""Template Haskell and Quasi-Quoting FTW!""\nDSLs or little interpreters are great in reducing code-size.\nReducing code size is great, arguably nr.1, in reducing bugs.<p>> As with Ruby and Sinatra, it is mostly a matter of taste.<p>I suspect you mean ""Rails and Sinatra"".<p>It is not a matter of taste: Rails and Sinatra both build on the Rack interface and have several options for http servers (mongrel/webrick/thin/etc).<p>With Yesod and Snap you find they both have their own ""Rack"".  Yesod has ""WAI"" and an http server ""Warp"" -- these blow every other option out of the water in terms of speed and seem to have a more clever design.<p>But it could be just my opinion. (I did remember reading somewhere that the Snap devs envy Yesod's speed and try to make their solution faster which is a good thing)<p>> Some people prefer lightweight frameworks and add the components they need, while others like to do things within one well-integrated framework.<p>This is mostly a matter of how you build your app: ""from scratch"" or ""scaffolded"".  Both Yesod and Snap allow both ways.  Scaffolding with Yesod brings you much further along the axis of ""well-integratedness"" then scaffolding with Snap which is obviously a win those preferring the scaffolding approach.",1334007203

The biological problem is clearly very hard, but the institutional problem is impossible.<p>You might or might not be familiar with the term ""OODA loop,"" originally developed by fighter pilots:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop</a><p>If the war on cancer was a dogfight, you'd need an order from the President every time you wanted to adjust your ailerons.  Your OODA loop is 10-20 years long.  If you're in an F-16 with Sidewinder missiles, and I'm in a Wright Flyer with a Colt .45, I'm still going to kill you under these conditions. Cancer is not (usually) a Wright Flyer with a Colt .45.<p>Lots of programmers are reading this.  Here's an example of what life as a programmer would be like if you had to work with a 10-year OODA loop.  You write an OS, complete with documentation and test suites, on paper.  10 years later, the code is finally typed in and you see if the test suites run.  If bug - your OS failed!  Restart the loop.  I think it's pretty obvious that given these institutional constraints, we'd still be running CP/M.  Oncology is still running CP/M.<p>Most cancer researchers are not even <i>in</i> the loop, really.  For one thing, 90% of your research is irreproducible:<p><a href=""http://www.pharmalot.com/2012/03/many-cancer-studies-are-actually-unreliable/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pharmalot.com/2012/03/many-cancer-studies-are-act...</a><p>Even when the science is reproducible, your cell lines and mouse models are crap and bear little or no resemblance to real tumors.  You know this, of course.  But you keep on banging your heads against the wall.<p>What would a tight OODA loop look like?  Imagine I'm Steve Jobs, with infinite money, and I have cancer.  Everyone's cancer is its own disease (if not several), so the researchers are fighting one disease (or several), instead of an infinite family of diseases.  They are not trying to cure pancreatic cancer - they are trying to cure Steveoma.<p>Second, they operate with no rules.  They can find an exploit in Steve's cancer genome on Wednesday, design a molecule to hack it on Thursday, synthesize it on Friday and start titrating it into the patient on Saturday.  Pharmacokinetics?  Just keep doubling the dose until the patient feels side effects.  Hey, it worked for Alexander Shulgin.<p>Moreover, Steve isn't on just one drug.  He's got thirty or forty teams attacking every vulnerability, theoretical or practical, that may exist in his cancer cells.  Why shouldn't he be attacking his cancer in 30 ways at the same time?  He's a billionaire, after all.<p>Not everyone is a billionaire.  But if you do this for enough billionaires, the common elements in the problem will start repeating and the researchers will learn a repertoire of common hacks.  Eventually, the unusual becomes usual - and cheap.  This is the way all technology is developed.<p>Of course, someone might screw up and a patient might die.  You'll note that a lot of cancer patients die anyway.  Steve got a lot, but he didn't get this - why not?  It would be illegal, that's why.  Sounds like something the Nazis would do.  Nazis!  In our hospitals!  Oh noes!<p>The entire thrust of our medical regulatory system, from the Flexner Report to today, is the belief that it's better for 1000 patients to die of neglect, than 1 from quackery.  Until this irrational fear of quack medicine is cured, there will be no real progress in the field.<p>The entire process we call ""drug development"" is an attempt to gain six-sigma confidence that we are not practicing quack medicine.  Especially for cancer, do we need all these sigmas?  And are we obtaining them in an efficient way?  I can't imagine how anyone would even begin to argue the point.<p>What is the source of this phobia?  It is ultimately a political fear - based on public opinion.  Its root is in the morbid, irrational fear of poisoning.  But it also has a political constituency - all the people it employs.  In that it has much in common with other ""anti-industries,"" like the software patent mafia.",1334007115

When one commissions a server or server farm it is done against a service non functional requirement. For example 1 second page serve time at peak load. This means that a lot of the time the servers might be waiting but not a peak load. Never the less, modern servers will clock down if waiting. Now, what sets the peak load is the efficiency of the software and the number of people using the server and/or the run length of the batch jobs. The more efficient the software the less servers are required to meet the peak load and so the less power is used all the time. Further, the more efficient the software the less often servers will have to clock up during off peak times. Do you finally get it? If not - I suspect you have zero idea about large scale computing and are here only to defend your lack of ability to program anything other than scripts.",1334005726

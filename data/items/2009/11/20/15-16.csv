952531,comment,951777,951844,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"There may be several reasons why sperm didn't evolve to be temperature tolerant. The first is likely that they would have suffered reduced motility just when it's needed, reducing fertility rates.<p>Another reason might be that maintaining the testicles at body temperature increases the risk of infection. There are very few purely sexually transmitted diseases, likely due to this temperature difference. Those same sexually transmitted diseases rarely cause harm beyond the genitals, and in fact these diseases are far more harmful to the female reproductive system than the male (a woman with undiagnosed gonorrhoea or chlamydia is essentially guaranteed to become sterile, however in men it either takes longer, or they may never become sterile - note that a male can lose a testicle to injury or disease without becoming sterile or losing fertility).<p>It's likely that there were more advantages to any male with dangling gonads over retracted. The reason why our testicles require constant temperature control (and independent control) is probably a more intriguing question, which IMO likely has a lot to do with our method of motility. A dog's testicles are unlikely to be affronted by the sun, however any naked male human has a serious problem when walking toward the sun. This likely wasn't a problem when we were semi-erect (in the evolutionary sense, not the <i>other</i> sense) and had hairy gonads, however why did modern humans develop wholly unprotected gonads? Think about it, our testicles don't even have protection against the sun! Dense hair provides protection against heat stroke, so did humans already have protection for our genitals before this became a problem? IE did our invention of clothing happen early enough that it actually changed the development of our sexual organs?",1258730749

What you state is a valid way to handle things.  4-5 years in, you have a profitable company that needs grown out from 70mph to 90mph.  But the trend is currently to start thinking about handing the company over when it still has training wheels on, way before it has hit 70mph.<p>The point that resonates with me is that people are so fixated on the hand-off that they fail to really make a (sustainable) company.  People ought to go into a venture thinking: I'm going to make a great company, and if at some point I decide to sell it/hand over management, I'll have that option.  Instead, from day 1 they are obsessed with getting out.<p>I think the article is too strong in saying 'everyone' does this, and I don't think it is the case that 'no one' should do that, but I think that businesses would be better off in general if that plan were the exception rather than the rule that it is becoming.",1258730443

Many years ago newspapers sold <i>news</i>, \nprinted on paper (see Benjamin Franklin \n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin</a>).  They charged a lot of \ncustomers a small amount each for that news, and made a business out of \naggregating lots of pennies.  They also could sell advertisements and \nnotices because they were a conduit to a relatively wide audience.<p>Google <a href=""http://images.google.com/images?q=benjamin+franklin+newspaper"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.google.com/images?q=benjamin+franklin+newspape...</a><p>Front page: \n<a href=""http://www.ndsu.nodak.edu/instruct/rcollins/436history/pictures/franklin.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ndsu.nodak.edu/instruct/rcollins/436history/pictu...</a><p>Example advertisements:\n<a href=""http://mitchellarchives.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/1748-franklin-ship-ad-and-pay-up.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitchellarchives.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/1748-...</a> and \n<a href=""http://www.earlyamerica.com/image/earlyamerica/past/past.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.earlyamerica.com/image/earlyamerica/past/past.jpg</a><p>Over time, newspapers and magazines reduced their reliance on aggregating \nlots of ""pennies"" subscribers paid and increased their reliance on \nadvertisements.  From a business point of view, this made lots of sense \nbecause aggregating pennies is much more difficult that getting large chunks \nof money from advertisers... and they could.<p>What newspapers ended up doing was outsourcing the bulk of their news \ngathering to news aggregation companies like the Associated Press (AP).  The \nup-side was it was cheaper to buy news from AP than create it independently. \nIt was also much more efficient, obviously, since only one source could feed \nmany, many papers.  The down-side was that the papers became dependent on \nthe outsourced news feeds and advertisement money.  The dark side is that we \ncan have hundreds of papers all feeding the same news source - it looks like \nthere is independence in the news reporting, but it is a mirage.<p>The result is that newspapers became more and more an intermediary broker \n(""middleman"") and generated less and less actual content.  They brokered \ntheir local eyeballs to advertisers and outsourced the creation of the \nproduct the eyeballs were looking for (news) to aggregation companies.<p>This made/makes newspapers very vulnerable to disruption by Google, \nCraigslist, and bloggers/tweeters because they (Google et. al.) are able to \nuse the internet to bypass the local newspapers, to cut out the middleman: \nthe newspapers no longer control access to (local) eyeballs.  As a result, \nthey lost their ability to broker eyeballs (acquired by outsourced news \nstories) for advertisements.<p>Just to aggrevate the problem for newspapers, the internet is a <i>MUCH</i> more \nefficient path to eyeballs.  The cost of the medium is small compared to \nphysical products (well, internet access is pretty expensive, but it is \nalready purchased by the eyeballs so the incremental cost to layer news on \ntop of the internet is nearly zero).  Couple that with the internet-based \nadvertisement to be able to target specific classes of eyeballs, and you \nhave a compelling case for lots of advertisement dollars to switch from \nprinted medium to internet medium.<p>News aggregation companies are also suffering as a ""knock-on"" effect. The \ninternet cut deeply into the primary funding source of newspapers -\nadvertisers.  As a side effect, this ""cuts off the oxygen supply"" to news \naggregation companies.<p>Moral of the story?  You can make a <i>lot</i> more money as a middleman than as \na company that produces a product, but it also makes you <i>very</i> vulnerable \nto disruption by companies that are more efficient (or more hungry) brokers.",1258729316

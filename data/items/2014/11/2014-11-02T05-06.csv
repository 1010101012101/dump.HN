8545800,comment,8544788,8544788,0,0,Denzel,,,"MOOCs are merely a stepping stone along a much broader movement. They were based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of how degree-granting institutions work. For most people, knowledge gained during the pursuit of a college degree is secondary to the projected $17,500 increase in salary. [1] MOOCs have no such carrot motivating people to complete them.<p>Online courses are just that: courses + the internet.  Anyone can load up on MIT OCW, Coursera, and Udacity lectures that have a value of ~$0 on a resume. What does a 10x improvement upon education look like? What happens when we stop watching talking heads in a video and start taking part in individualized tracks that can prove our knowledge of a subject to a certain degree of certainty, as it evolves over time, for any subject. The issue has never been learning, it&#x27;s been proving that you know what you&#x27;ve learned.<p>As it stands now, college degrees serve as a signal for what someone knows. No matter how outdated that notion is.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/02/11/study-income-gap-between-young-college-and-high-school-grads-widens"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/02/11/study-income-...</a>",1414907955

In studies 1 and 2, upper-class individuals were more likely to break the law while driving, relative to lower-class individuals. In follow-up laboratory studies, upper-class individuals were more likely to exhibit unethical decision-making tendencies (study 3), take valued goods from others (study 4), lie in a negotiation (study 5), cheat to increase their chances of winning a prize (study 6), and endorse unethical behavior at work (study 7) than were lower-class individuals.

8545789,comment,8532261,8534396,0,0,vidarh,,,"Consider that for interracial marriage, the US was lagging international opinion substantially. E.g. in large parts of Europe there either haven&#x27;t been restrictions on interracial marriage, or they have been very limited and lifted earlier, and in many countries such as the UK, there is a history of interracial marriages going back centuries (e.g. many people married Indians that came to Britain after the establishment of the East India Company). Much further resistance evaporated when European countries had an acute shortage of men following World War I, that was filled by increased immigration from own colonies.<p>While that may not have had a direct impact, most of the arguments against interracial marriage were thus demonstrably false, by looking to other countries, and a substantial proportion of the population of the US had come from countries where interracial marriage was legal and somewhat accepted when they emigrated.<p>Further, with interracial marriages, the marriages had the support of a far larger amount of churches, and legalisation happened amidst a general major push for equalisation of rights that had rallied a lot of people.<p>On the other hand, many of the same countries that have been liberal about interracial marriages maintained laws targeting gay people far longer, and both domestically and internationally there was not nearly the same momentum for gay rights.<p>Again consider the UK, where it took until <i>1994</i> for a serious attempt to reduce the age of consent for male gay sex to the same as for straight sex (from 21 to 16; bizarrely the UK did not <i>have</i> an age of consent for sexual acts between females). It took until <i>2001</i> for that to become reality:<p>The first attempt was defeated; a court challenge to the European Court of Human Right forced the UK government to try again; it was defeated twice more, and then the House of Lords dragged its feet long enough that the government was able to use Parliament Act to push it through with only the support of the House of Commons in late 2000.<p>As late as then, people seriously used as an argument that we needed to &quot;protect the children&quot;.",1414907590
8545788,comment,8544788,8544788,0,0,Chevalier,,,"It&#x27;s not MOOCs that depend on mystification -- it&#x27;s traditional universities. Whether for-profit or non-profit, these are institutions that rake in upwards of $50k per year per student in exchange for mostly worthless seminars on art history and communications. The only way they get away with this incredible fraud is that the fading mystique of a bachelor&#x27;s degree (and increasingly the mystique of master&#x27;s and doctorate degrees) has become a minimum threshold requirement to enter the professional workforce in a self-reinforcing inflationary cycle.<p>I feel compelled to cite my own Ivy League professional degree every time a discussion on education comes up. I&#x27;m not speaking from envy or resentment. 99% of the education I received was doodling during unbelievably inefficient lectures and handing in token papers blaming the holy trinity of colonialism, race, and gender for every possible subject matter -- literary analysis, cultural study, or virtually any field where the professor wouldn&#x27;t dare to mark down politically correct answers. I can only imagine how much more worthless the experiences have been of students studying less rigorous majors at less rigorous universities.<p>Without default-proof student loans, few students would be stupid enough to borrow such vast sums of money for such useless degrees. Nobody has ever deemed an author or a poet worthwhile on the basis of their certificates rather than their body of work. There was a time not so long ago that nurses, cops, and teachers didn&#x27;t need infamously pointless certification to do their job. Even professional fields, like my own career in law, was traditionally an apprenticeship rather than a three-year slog through relatively pointless studies in exchange for (based on a ten-year repayment plan) more than a half-million dollars in debt.<p>But at least I received a professional degree. Undergraduate degrees outside of STEM fields (which may reasonably require certification) are increasingly justified by the mystique of &quot;teaching you how to think&quot; or, in William Deresiewicz&#x27;s language, building a self and developing a soul.<p>To quote Steven Pinker&#x27;s excellent takedown of Deresiewicz: &quot;Perhaps I am emblematic of everything that is wrong with elite American education, but I have no idea how to get my students to build a self or become a soul. It isn’t taught in graduate school, and in the hundreds of faculty appointments and promotions I have participated in, we’ve never evaluated a candidate on how well he or she could accomplish it. I submit that if “building a self” is the goal of a university education, you’re going to be reading anguished articles about how the universities are failing at it for a long, long time.&quot; 1<p>- - - - - - - - - -<p>Let&#x27;s take down this article point by point.<p>(1) &quot;There are several reasons for the disillusionment. First, the average student in a MOOC is not a Turkish villager with no other access to higher education but a young white American man with a bachelor’s degree and a full-time job.&quot;<p>It takes remarkable inculcation of the &quot;whitey is bad&quot; mindset to think that intelligent, driven people studying in their free time is bad if they&#x27;re educated white men. Would the author condemn MOOCs if they were instead dominated by impoverished African women?<p>Nor does this argument in any way mean that since white people are studying, nobody else may study. Young white men are overwhelmingly the early adopters of ANY revolutionary technology, including the Internet and cell phones. Every time access to knowledge was pioneered by young white men, the resulting benefits were quickly taken up by the rest of the world as soon as infrastructure was established.<p>(2) &quot;A second problem is that when MOOCs replace traditional courses, an extremely high number of students fail.&quot;<p>Yes... that&#x27;s what happens when you study a subject in your free time, which vanishingly few of us have. Most of my colleagues can barely sleep, much less have dinner with their girlfriends or sustain marriages with their increasingly dissatisfied wives.<p>And we&#x27;re the lucky ones! Poor and middle-class Americans work absolutely ridiculous hours at multiple jobs for virtually no pay and certainly no benefits or savings. Worse, the bottom 85% of the country have increasingly abandoned marriage and important social support structures in favor of having children without partners or with a rotating cast of partners... with all the consequent dysfunction that you might imagine.<p>I myself have signed up for a number of MOOC courses in computer science that I&#x27;ve barely started, for lack of time and focus. I&#x27;m hoping to transition soon to a job that allows me regular hours and secure employment so I can spend my free time learning for its own sake... but until then, my MOOC courses will remain incomplete (and failed) and my favorite books will remain unread.<p>If this point argues anything, it&#x27;s that leisure time is valuable. I don&#x27;t see why a teenager would be better off paying $50k+/year to attend lesser quality artisanal lectures from lesser professors than they would be simply spending those years living in a city and studying Harvard&#x27;s MOOCs at Starbucks.<p>(3) &quot;What’s more, for many instructors, the courses are on-the-job training in online education. Two-thirds of MOOC professors surveyed by The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2013 said they had never taught a fully online course before their first open online class.&quot;<p>Jesus christ. Really.<p>In the first place, MOOCs have barely entered their first couple years of existence. No kidding you don&#x27;t have many people experienced in broadcasting lectures online. Why would this negatively impact the quality of these experienced professors&#x27; lectures?<p>In the second place, the author says the solution is to introduce certification in teaching MOOCs. Can&#x27;t cut out that institutional middleman, can we?<p>In the third place, inexperienced adjunct professors absolutely DOMINATE college teaching. The tenured professor who earns six figures is vanishing quickly in favor of bloated administration and harried graduate students who waste their youth on useless doctorates and burn out on underpaid teaching positions. If Selingo wants experienced senior professors teaching courses, I can&#x27;t imagine a better source than any given MOOC.<p>(4) &quot;Coursera and edX, the two main MOOC providers, are essentially acting as gatekeepers for American higher education online, replicating in their virtual world the pecking order in the physical world as determined by U.S. News & World Report rankings.&quot;<p>INCREDIBLE. In an effort to decry free access to the best educations, Selingo complains that MOOCs generally pursue the best professors from the best universities, as defined by the best students. Because in the absence of MOOCs, anyone could attend Harvard courses for free from anywhere in the world at their own schedule. Calling MOOCs &quot;gatekeepers&quot; rather than educational institutions requires the highest level of intellectual dishonesty.<p>Selingo also implies that these talentless schmucks from Harvard are crowding out more talented professors from no-name schools. Not only is there literally nothing keeping a competing no-name from publishing their own course, there&#x27;s nothing keeping them from publishing their own PLATFORM to rival Coursera or edX. It&#x27;s not as though Udacity has a long brand history or a monopoly on competent teaching.<p>Nor are existing platforms hostile to non-Ivy courses in the first place. I&#x27;m currently working my way through some UToronto courses in computer science, an opportunity I would never have had otherwise. Of course, I could have attended a vastly inferior course at a local college at amazing expense in terms of time and money... but at least I would have employed inferior institutions and kept the student loan money rolling in.<p>- - - - - - - - - -<p>To Selingo&#x27;s credit, he acknowledges that MOOCs allow students to study their passions at their own pace. To introduce that obvious fact after this series of libelous attacks on MOOCs doesn&#x27;t feel particularly redemptive, but... let&#x27;s give him the benefit of the doubt.<p>I actually purchased Selingo&#x27;s book when it was published, in aspirational hopes of working through my enormous backlog of unread books in the near future. Of course, by Selingo&#x27;s calculations, my failure to complete his book signals the pointlessness of book publication. I should instead pay enormous sums to have vastly inferior writers cobble together their own inadequate interpretations on the subject of MOOCs three times a week, in a schedule that prevents me from maintaining worthwhile employment and forces me to take out predatory student loans that fund such middlemen institutions.<p>We should expect these attacks to continue as the value of worthless degrees is called into question. There are going to be a LOT of unemployed doctorates and administration in the coming decade, most of whom have no practical skills except professional outrage. Allow me to state the obvious: MOOCs are an unqualified blessing on the world, and impart the best parts of an education without the cost of kids&#x27; youths and hundreds of thousands of dollars. They are the future of education. And that is a wonderful, wonderful gift to every generation to come.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119321/harvard-ivy-league-should-judge-students-standardized-tests"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119321/harvard-ivy-league...</a>",1414907562

Help us change that at Clever (YC S12)<p>There’s a lot of great educational software out there - think Oregon Trail, Math Blasters, and Carmen Sandiego - but teachers can’t use it in schools.  Teachers would love to use programs like these, but synchronizing data between their school’s database and external software applications is a huge problem that results in wasted time at the start of class and frustrated, bored students… which leads to software being abandoned entirely.  80% of K-12 teachers would use more software in classes if getting students logged in weren’t such a hassle, and a quarter of all class time that’s supposed to be dedicated to software is wasted on logins alone.<p>Developers have a similar problem: they love clean APIs, but in the education industry, they haven’t had one.  Most K-12 schools house their student data in ancient legacy databases that make integrations a nightmare.  If you’re a five-person startup and you’ve built an app that revolutionizes the way third-graders learn fractions, there’s simply no way to get your product in front of students.<p>Clever (YC S12 - clever.com) is solving these problems by building a modern, developer-friendly API for schools… which we give them for free.  Developers love being able to plug into schools without having to write a complex integration for every single district they’re working with, so they pay us for access to the platform.  This business model has helped us grow quickly; we’re now in 1 in 5 schools in America (over 30,000 schools), and our product is used by millions of students every day.<p>Our goal is to become the education identity company.  The first step in that direction is our Instant Login single sign-on platform: a universal login that allows students to access all of their learning applications in one place.  (This is a big deal if you’ve ever seen a second-grader try to manage fifteen different usernames and passwords.)<p>Right now we’re a team of 40 people (17 engineers) based in downtown San Francisco.  We’re looking for full-stack engineers who can hack in Node, Go, and Python (or are willing to learn), but more importantly, we’re looking for people who share our passion for improving education.

With an H1-B visa, an employee can at least change jobs and find another employer to work for. All the other employer has to do is transfer the H1 sponsorship, which is a few thousand dollars in fees but no legal hassles and not much delay. So with H1, you have decent job mobility. With the L-1 visa, which is almost never discussed in the media covering immigration, there is ZERO job mobility. You can only work for the company that got you to the United States from abroad where you were working for the same company.

I&#x27;m sorry but I still think that if the outcome of the release of the patch is 12M sites hacked this isn&#x27;t a good outcome.  I wasn&#x27;t aware of the 5 day window but maybe a bigger announcement should have been made.  I never heard of the issue (and it wasn&#x27;t on HN) prior to the release of the patch.  The Oct 10th announcement wasn&#x27;t proportional to the size of the issue.<p>It&#x27;s trivial to find out what a patch affects but it&#x27;s not necessarily easy to find out what the issue is unless the patch actually addresses the specific bug.  I&#x27;m talking more generally than this specific exploit.  Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s an OpenSSL bug in AES/128 implementation.  You could release a patch to the AES/128 code or you could release a patch disabling AES/128.  The former is an open invitation to hackers.  The latter still leaves a potentially large task of figuring out what exactly in the AES128 is the issue.

I was put on Focalin, Ritalin, Adderall, Vyvanse over those years.. they all made me calm and focused. Without my meds, I used to live in my head all day, theorizing how the universe and neurons work.. playing with ideas, twisting shapes in my mind. I was also prone to depression, anxiety, and I hated dealing with emotions.<p>Then one day, when I was about 23, I did LSD and cannabis together. My whole world came crashing down, and I realized that ADHD was a label that limited my true potential, and made me judgmental of &quot;neurotypicals&quot;. After my trip, I realized that I lost about 75% of my visual-spatial ability (I felt out of it for a year or so as I missed having that ability), but I also felt more at peace, open-minded, and in the present moment. I also became a &quot;doer&quot;, rather than a &quot;thinker&quot;. I do not use any meds at all now; I meditate in the morning for at least 20 minutes, and try to run at least once a week.<p>With that said, I still like variety, and am a jack of all trades.

I deduce things noticeably faster than my peers as long as it&#x27;s not socially related.  I have intense focus as long as something remains stimulating.  When things lose my interest or are pointless they become tedious and it&#x27;s not about attention span.  I cannot stop worrying about assigned tasks to the point of anxiety.  There is a mental barrier and I cannot work on the task despite intentions and efforts to do so.  Medications don&#x27;t really help me.  They do at first, then they become less effective.  An interesting side note about meds:  The first time on meds I finally could see social cues and body language.  It was a whole new world.  I still see them off the meds now that I know about them but I may have trouble understanding what they mean due to lack of experience in receiving those signals.  Getting proper sleep, nutrition, and having regular, serious exercise help more than meds.  The affliction is very real.

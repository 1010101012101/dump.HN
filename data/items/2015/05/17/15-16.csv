Be aware that excessive negative emotional responses are bad (as they lead to depression), so it is better to just observe bad situations and try not to get overly emotional. Secondly, try to resolve the issue (either by actively managing it, or by accepting that the world is just like that and you can&#x27;t change it), so that the conflict doesn&#x27;t arise in future.<p>For [2], the solution is to have a purpose in life, with motivating, goal-oriented activities that you enjoy. I suspect this might be the issue for you. There is more to life than having a well-paid job. I gave up very well paid contract work 15 years ago, as I hated it. Since then I have worked on my own business. I earn a hell of a lot less money now, but I&#x27;m much happier.<p>Having friends (or at least social contact) is also important to mental health, even if that is just saying hello to people you meet on the street, or chatting to like-minded people online.<p>Please don&#x27;t wait for something to happen. Take charge of your life and do something about it. Being depressed all the time is an unnatural state, and is your brain&#x27;s way of telling you that you need to change something in your life. Sometimes you need to make major changes in your life to make things better.<p>Feel free to email me at cpncrunchhn@gmail.com if you want to chat.",1431878394

This is especially true for young organizations, or those that have gone through a cycle of renewal.<p>Google decided early on to drive towards an operational architecture that allows individuals to act at scale on their infrastructure.  A developer deploys into production, it launches thousands of new containers and disposes thousands of old containers.  A batch job is run, same thing. Deploying services is uniform across the board.  Thus, optimizing utilization through improved container scheduling is something that the core site reliability engineering team could do independently of individual services.<p>Google&#x27;s early adoption of data center sized computing by Hozle & team was unique, along with Amazon&#x27;s CEO-diktat move to decentralized service-oriented architecture, or Netflix&#x27;s rewrite and move to cloud.  Which is why you have articles like this, written by a VC, that want to repackage this thinking and sell it back to old school IT.",1431878371

The problem is finding that person, and once you find that person and you work them to the bone for a couple of weeks, they will not be as smart or as focused no matter where they started out at. They will continue to deteriorate till their output is of lower quality than average, even if they were brilliant at first. This is the point most manager, founders, owners, and executives that support working their employees overtime intentionally miss. There is no way a human being can keep up quality work being sleep deprived and working around the clock. Even a little sleep deprivation and a bit of extra overtime will take its toll after a few weeks.<p>That will happen even if you pay employees overtime, which most companies and proponents of overtime are vehemently against because the real reason they demand it is because they want to exploit free labor along the lines of temporary slavery. No wonder there is so much shitty code out there, especially at startups and other companies that love to overwork their employees without paying them. Then they call it &quot;technical debt,&quot; as if there was anything technical about depriving employees of sleep, health, and their life outside the company. And finally, to top it all off, they want us, the employees, to enjoy being worked overtime and having our health ruined and our time stolen. The delusions of management and executives in this area is incredible.<p>But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to call employees willing to subject themselves to this suckers, only the ones who do so knowingly and willingly.

If you have ever seen a talented salesperson alternate pushing and withdrawal as they manage the prospect&#x27;s anxiety and vanity while bringing them to a purchase, you have seen the element that is present in some CBT, but not part of the official training.  Without that management by the therapist, the client may feel worse in sessions, and might come away with the sense that CBT is belittling.  An irony here is that the greater respect of empowering the client may feel like less respect.",1431876998

Stallman even mention generics which C++ doesn&#x27;t have and it is very different to the templates mechanism that C++ does have.<p>As for the people who actually uses the language (specially after C++11), most of them would tell you that there is a great subset of the language that works for them. A valid argument I have heard before is that subset is different with each people and the problem arises when maintaining somebody else code. Well that happens with every language (Have you ever had to debug a memory corruption bug in an old C code with void* all over the place? Hint: it&#x27;s not pleasent )<p>C++ is a language that allow you to use abstractions with a very reasonable performance and very reasonable resources, and in that niche there is not a real alternative.<p>Yes, you can have a fine tuned VM running Java or .Net code that might be comparable with C++ but with a cost in memory.

Totally speculating, but it could be because AirBnB has brought so much attention that a number of states in the US are creating new barriers to entry for other companies and are preventing some of the innovation.  States are trying to prevent revenue loss on bed and sales tax etc so they want to make sure they legislate the hell out of short term rentals.<p>In Florida where I am, if you rent your property for short terms (generally < 6 months at a time I believe) you are treated more like a motel operator than a property owner. So you are subject to a host of taxes and potentially license requirements that you wouldn&#x27;t be otherwise. There are entire companies down here that manage these types of properties for the large number of absentee owners. From what I understand those companies require a licensed real estate agent if they are going to market the home for rent because the home owner isn&#x27;t doing it themselves.  Not sure how that plays with AirBnB, but I&#x27;d think you escape it if you posted your own home up there.  But I know last year Florida was trying to change state laws to make it more difficult for these sharing type services.<p>I think AirBnB used the oops, sorry we didn&#x27;t know excuse a lot.  And then they have had a war chest of cash to work with the states to come to some reasonable agreements, or lobby for changes.  But I don&#x27;t think it is over by any means, and so new startups have more hurdles to overcome in some of the states most prone to use a service like this.  I think once it shakes out and the rules are better known and understood, then you might get some startups that popup.

Such illegal gambling often leads to some sort of organized crime around providing loans and the actual gambling service itself. But I was also thinking of alcohol prohibition in the 1920&#x27;s and the current drug prohibition. The black markets that these events created are not that dissimilar from the one around gambling and the core cause is the same.<p>I do think that eliminating the profit incentive is something that could work. The profit from gambling is cited as a redeeming quality, however, as a reason for legalized gambling to exist. The overwhelming idea, at least in the US, is that if people are going to have a vice (or fun, depending on your perspective), their activities should be taxed so that others (corporations and the government mainly) can profit from them. Perhaps if the money actually went to fund schools and other things that benefit society, I could get behind this viewpoint, but regardless of the claims of governments that have legal gambling, it doesn&#x27;t.

Sure, there is a CL library for basically any task, but there is rarely more than one, and often the libraries are not widely used or well documented. Since we&#x27;re building a site largely by standing on the shoulders of others, this made things a little tougher. There just aren&#x27;t as many shoulders on which to stand.<p>...<p>We were already familiar with Python.

You could satisfy your entire calorie requirement with lard, but that would be extremely detrimental to your health.<p>Also, how our bodies process food is still not well-understood in detail (although there are tons of self-titled experts claiming otherwise). In other words, excess calories == weight gain and insufficient calories == weight loss don&#x27;t work out just as nicely as you&#x27;d think (I think there was an article on HN recently that even pointed out different people have different &quot;default weights&quot; they would find very difficult to stray from in either direction).<p>Additionally simply not eating that much can be very difficult. Not everyone has the time, energy and money to ensure they eat healthy (and the right things eat the right times of the day) -- although of course for energy this can be somewhat of a catch-22 (bad eating habits lead to lack of energy leading to bad eating habits). And there&#x27;s also the problem of satiation and rabbit starvation: it&#x27;s hard to stick with a diet if your body signals you that you&#x27;re starving and must eat.<p>As a rule of thumbs, sure, just eat less calories if you&#x27;re overweight.

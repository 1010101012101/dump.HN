Gitlab has had much less pushback.<p>Really, it depends on whether your users are more comfortable with the command line or web interface.<p>Also, I found Gitolite to be a bit easier to administer than Gitlab.  Gitlab is a Rails web app, with lots of moving parts.  Gitolite is essentially a bunch of Perl scripts which use authorized_keys and SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND hackery to convince ssh to do the actual authenticating.<p>If you already know and love deploying Rails web apps (I don&#x27;t), then you might find Gitlab easier.",1375606731

I see the reasoning behind your current design, but still none of the options look really great...<p>a. Home server. Most people don&#x27;t have a fixed IP or domain name, so it&#x27;s going to be a pain for them to access their home server on the run. I <i>do</i> have a fixed IP, but I&#x27;d still hesitate to rely on my home connection whilst I&#x27;m roaming.<p>b. Localhost.

6155043,comment,6154493,6154956,10,0,ordinary,,,"<i>So your implication is that going after child pornography is a wasted effort?</i>\nThe article linked earlier in this thread concludes: &quot;after adjustment for response rates and definitions, the prevalence of child sexual abuse was not found to vary significantly over the three decades reviewed&quot;.<p>If that conclusion is indeed correct, then apparently our efforts to put a halt to it haven&#x27;t worked. There are then two possible conclusions:<p>1) We haven&#x27;t done enough <i>yet</i>. Doubling the available budget will improve the situation.<p>2) Our current methods are pointless. No amount of effort will do the trick, and going after child porn is indeed a wasted effort.<p>Personally, I think it&#x27;s a combination of the two. The advent of the internet has made sharing illegal content orders of magnitude easier. Even if our efforts at curtailing child porn are effective, those efforts have largely been outpaced by technological development. In this it&#x27;s similar to general internet piracy.<p>On the other hand, it is questionable whether going after child pornography is the right way to combat child sexual abuse at all. The jury is still out on the question whether watching porn increases one&#x27;s likelihood of committing sexual assault, though recent studies seem to conclude this is not the case, even for violent porn, and that there might even be an inverse relation.[0]<p>If that is indeed the case, then child pornography is not a trigger for child sexual abuse, merely a result thereof. Then going after child porn is justified to prevent the abuse of the children involved, but no more important than preventing the abuse of children whose abuse is not recorded and distributed: we should be focusing on preventing child abuse altogether, and place less emphasis on whether there&#x27;s a camera present or not.<p>[edit] In my comment, I implicitly assume that (violent) legal pornography is to sexual abuse as child porn is to child sexual abuse. That may not be entirely accurate. See derefr&#x27;s post[1], which discusses some of the differences in economic incentives between the creation and distribution of normal porn and those of child porn.<p>_____<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/pornography.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/pornography.pdf</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6155015"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6155015</a>",1375604746

You could argue exactly opposite way. It could help potential abusers channel their urges.<p>> Stopping the distribution of photos of children being raped -> less children being raped so that photos can be distributed for profit.<p>That &quot;->&quot; sign in your statement for me comes with huge &quot;?&quot; inside. Profit from distribution comes mostly from copyright. And I would never dream to grant anyone a copyright on images of child abuse. My point is that suppression of distribution and possession is not necessarily best tool, not that we should destigmatize images of child abuse somehow and repackage it into commercially tradable commodity.<p>Higher availability of existing material might cause less demand for production of new material. Production would be as illegal as always or even more so and more dangerous as there is wider number of people trying to track those bastards down.<p>Many people expect rise in the demand when such sick material becomes widely available and that this rise in the demand will increase the number of children being abused. That, I think comes from belief which I don&#x27;t share that lots of people (given opportunity) are potential pedophiles.<p>When internet became popular, availability of images of human corpses massacred in different ways massively increased. Some people already liked looking at such pictures, others discovered that they like them, some liked to look at a few of them but fed up or seen something so horrible that they reached their limit and found them disgusting altogether.<p>And yet we didn&#x27;t notice any sudden spike of people maiming others in order to create such pictures.<p>> I&#x27;ll even argue that legalizing distribution of such images will normalize the behavior in sick individuals.<p>Yes. Probably. Some of them might live less disturbed lives. Some might even seek help. The only harm I could imagine that could come from watching pictures of abused child (if you personally can bear it) is that some people will strive to produce new such for fame in the community (no copyright so I believe financial motivation will drop not raise). But such sick fame could only be attached to a nick not the real person. And such fame would be very dangerous. I could compare such fame to fame of the crackers. But some of them do get caught even though at least 60% of internet user love them, or at least love the job they do. I think this would never be the case with child abusers. I think even some people who can look at such images and even find pleasure in looking at them would gladly out someone who hurts children to the police.<p>I&#x27;m sorry for disturbing your peace with my thoughts but I don&#x27;t advocate encouraging any kind of child abuse economy. There&#x27;s some economy in all human activity. Even in abusing children. This economy is already actively influenced by people who want to reduce how much of it is going on (and that amounts to pretty much almost everybody). I&#x27;m just not sure if common sense attempts to influence this economy are best for the goal in mind. People tend to make mistakes when they act intuitively instead of scientifically and there is very little data when it comes to such grave social issues.<p>As for why children are suffering child abuse... In my opinion is that it mostly because there are sick people who like abusing children. And also in my opinion that&#x27;s a very small subset of people who like to watch images of child abuse. I think that producing images of child abuse is sort of a sideshow to actual child abuse. There are probably some people who exploit children strictly for profit but I suspect most of imagery is produced by pedophiles who would exploit children anyways but they also like taking pictures.",1375603723

(I&#x27;m going to speak in these economic terms in the rest of this, because it&#x27;s kind of disgusting to be more concrete.)<p>The original producers are part of the primary market, and only pay attention to the consumers that participate in the primary market. The secondary market--where open sharing of &quot;used&quot; content goes on--is ignored by the primary market.<p>The primary-market producers for exploitative pornography consist mainly of two types: individuals who film their own acts of exploitation to use <i>as currency in trade</i> for the films of exploitation-acts of others; and professionals, usually members of a crime syndicate that has humman trafficking business, who sell their content on the black market in less reputable countries. In both of these cases, the produced works are <i>scarce goods</i>: as few people will see them as can be managed.<p><i>Leaks</i> to the secondary market are bad for the producers in the primary market; not only do they increase supply for the consumers in the primary market (and thereby drive down demand), but they also make it much more likely that law-enforcement will get their hands on the offending media, and be able to analyze it for clues to the individual or group&#x27;s whereabouts, or just as proof in a trial. Thus, the producers in the primary market tend to enforce a loan-shark-like &quot;you break my trust, I break your knuckles&quot; policy on the redistribution of their content.<p>The incentives are basically just entirely missing for anyone in the primary market to specifically release content to the secondary market.

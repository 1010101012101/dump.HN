The upper-middle-class, isolationist people who are now crowding into Williamsburg are the same sorts of provincial people that their forebears (the artists who can no longer afford to live there) fled suburbia to escape. That suburbia&#x27;s biggest haters are (in origin and mindset) quite suburban is actually ironic rather than just sarcastic.<p>It&#x27;s a false dichotomy.  Manhattan is not the only way to build a dense city.  It&#x27;s not the most pleasant way to do so, either, but neither is it even the most <i>un</i>pleasant.<p>There are ways to build dense cities that people can afford to live in and actually enjoy living in.  What there&#x27;s not a lot of is political will to implement these ways of doing things, because location is assumed to be a zero-sum privilege people should pay for instead of a public good people should share.",1417938998

So you reduce the amount of info. Why is this hard? Because you seek immediate satisfaction, that is what you get from all that information. But all this info is not satisfactory in the long run, hence your cry out to HN. The process of undoing these tendencies is not rewarding at all in the short term, but it will be in the long run.

There&#x27;s usually debt involved, often taken on by the business being bought.  There&#x27;s also usually some tax gimmick involved. It&#x27;s interesting how often a business turns around after going private, even with the same management team.

But debt and equity still confer different rights to affect operations.</i><p>Yes, debt and equity are not the same thing. But they&#x27;re a lot closer than they used to be. Here&#x27;s a piece on startup financing, comparing convertible debt vs. preferred equity. (<a href=""http://mintonlawgroup.com/?p=173"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mintonlawgroup.com/?p=173</a>) The classic property of debt is that there is a bounded upside; the best that could happen was that the creditor got their money back with interest. With convertible debt, if the company does well, or even just gets another round of funding, the loan can be converted to stock and the creditor can win big. If the company fails, as creditors they&#x27;re ahead of all equity holders and maybe even general creditors. It&#x27;s also not unusual for creditors to demand a seat or seats on the board, even if they don&#x27;t have equity.<p><i>It is difficult to speak of stock buybacks out of context; their use is varied, from purely financial to entirely structural.</i><p>Yes, their use is varied. But about 87% of US corporate borrowing since 2009 is for stock buybacks or dividends. (<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/corporations-cant-stop-gobbling-up-their-own-stock/2014/05/09/83c8ddb0-d6e6-11e3-aae8-c2d44bd79778_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/corporations-cant-sto...</a>). This reflects the low, low interest rates the Fed is offering.  Equity to debt conversion is so tempting.<p><i>It is also difficult to make tax arguments out of context.</i><p>Most tax arguments for political campaign purposes are over tax rates over time. There&#x27;s less public discussion over what is taxed at which rate.  That, though, is what a sizable fraction of K Street lobbyists spend their time on. See &quot;<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/business/tax-lobby-works-to-defeat-overhaul-it-once-cheered.html&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/business/tax-lobby-works-t...</a>, which notes, on tax breaks, &quot;If you are not at the table, you are on the menu&quot;. Relative tax rates for alternatives drive many business decisions.  Absolute rates, less so.  Over the years, capital gains tax rates have gone up and down without affecting capital spending comparably.

I wonder though what we can actually discuss here.<p>Consider this, if a MS employee hacked you using say, company access to your hotmail account that only MS employees have, a system by design ripe for abuse, and therefore fixable by MS and therefore a MS responsibility, then that&#x27;s relevant.<p>But if a MS employee hacked you on the job without anything special that makes him a MS employee (he could&#x27;ve been working for DELL, Apple or hell he could&#x27;ve been unemployed) and  just happened to be a MS employee that hacked you, what&#x27;s the relevance? It&#x27;s just an incident that MS has no real responsibility for.<p>Even less responsibility if said employee wasn&#x27;t an employee, but just a 3rd party freelancer.<p>I think it begs the question: &#x27;what didn&#x27;t uber do that they should have?&#x27;.

I am sure that taxis have their drivers verified also, but taxis don&#x27;t send me their driver&#x27;s name and car license plate nor can I track the ride within the taxi service system itself. User is using technology to make the relationship between passenger and driver safer. If they fail on this, they need to be totally open and honest about it and discuss how to find better solutions.

(The graphic frames it as Democratic-voting versus Republican-voting but the population difference is also similar.)<p>Here are some examples from my own time living in an urban setting versus the suburbs:<p>- Road packages are always a given and almost never subject to a vote unless, as in the case of Washington State, someone bothers to get an initiative or ratification on the ballot.  Urban mass transit, like buses and light rail, always come with a vote.  So transit has to clear the legislature, the governor, and then the people.  That presupposes that the legislature actually does anything.  Roads only get stuck with the first two and &quot;building the future&quot; is wildly popular.<p>- Going back to roads for a second dip: Road funding for rural and suburban areas tends to be at the state level.  A highway through Okanogan or Ferry counties is paid for by King county residents.  In contrast, cities in King county tend to fund their road needs through local taxes--usually through the much-hated vehicle registration tax--and have to do so in a series of piecemeal ballot votes.  So rural areas get taxed once, urban areas twice or three times depending on how many taxing jurisdictions are at play and how much roads versus transit is needed.<p>- Services which would be inefficient to fund through direct charges, like sewer systems or electric, get paid for at the state or county level and the urban areas pay into those pools but get little back.<p>In Texas, there is a saying that &quot;build the houses and the roads [or electric lines or what have you] will follow.&quot;  I have lost count of the number of times my electric bill in my former residence went up because the poles-and-wires company needed to serve more far-flung suburban sprawl.<p>There is a lot to be said for taxing ourselves as a society to pay for our shared good.  Education, clean water, sanitary sewers, transportation; all good topics.  The problem comes with, as inevitably happens, those folks in the suburban and rural areas both declaring that they &quot;did it all by themselves&quot; and also denying the urban areas the ability to tax ourselves to build what we now need.<p>Is it an intentional act by the individuals who move to the suburbs?  No, but it sure feels that way when the ballots are cast.",1417937203

That&#x27;s a bit offensive actually and really needs to be backed up with a lot more than just an assumption.<p>To address your analogy. If a security flaw in the form leaks personal info and privacy of tens of millions of people is compromised as a direct result (like has happened), that&#x27;s a bit different from an indirect result in a screening process that affects a single person. Consider that statement beyond the fact that this seems like an incident, as I&#x27;m not trying to make a numerical comparison between the two examples here. What I mean is that one is a direct consequence, while the other is not. That is, I wonder if there is any screening process that could have prevented this, if there was any one thing they forgot to do that directly caused this event.<p>Using your analogy, if the security form leaked only a single piece of information and the leak was due to say a third party (like the driver in this case, say it&#x27;d be a problem in the Chrome browser) that Uber should have noticed in development, it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal and beyond the technicality of the particular security flaw, it&#x27;s not relevant. I wouldn&#x27;t flag it, but I&#x27;d easily see why others would.<p>Anyway I don&#x27;t want to push this analogy much further as frankly I don&#x27;t feel comfortable with it, I certainly don&#x27;t want to belittle this rape and compare it to something non-trivial like a security form. Apologies in advance if anyone felt that way about this post.<p>To get to the actual point: what is uber&#x27;s responsibility? I think that&#x27;s the key question here. It&#x27;s a bit of a tricky one. Uber kind of sits between two positions. The first is that it&#x27;s &#x27;just the facilitator&#x27;, and can&#x27;t be fully responsible for 3rd party drivers. Of course it&#x27;ll claim to aim to feel responsible, but in the end uber drivers aren&#x27;t like real employees. Uber kind of feels like more of a freelancer on odesk type of place, at least to me, where Odesk would have limited responsibility. On the other hand, they also try to position themselves as a quality brand, as distinctly Uber, as a company with its own drivers, not random freelancers on its platform. It&#x27;s clear they have responsibility, but how much?<p>Anyway, perhaps that&#x27;s not the correct question. A more specific question would be: what kind of screening process could they have had that prevented this?<p>You said this: > But a rape happens because of security flaws in the driver signup process<p>But I wonder what exactly that flaw was. Sure there&#x27;s a chance he did this before and was registered somewhere and a background check would let that fact surface, but I think it&#x27;s unlikely. Most rapists aren&#x27;t the cliche-criminal, it&#x27;s usually an uncle, a boss, a friend. It&#x27;s likely none of these people, nor likely the driver, would carry stereotypical characteristics of a person you&#x27;d want to reject in the hiring process. Meanwhile, Uber does have his identity on file and records of the trip, so it&#x27;s likely he&#x27;ll be caught just as quickly as an employee of any other company. As such I still wonder if this isn&#x27;t just an incident unrelated to company policy like the case of the rape of a Polish woman earlier this year in India in a regular taxi.<p>Anyway I have no clue about what kind of screening they do and what kind of screening is typical for drivers at a taxi company. If anyone is privy to this info let me know! In any case I think it&#x27;s a clear signal Uber should improve its screening process so that we&#x27;ll never hear from a case where someone was raped in a taxi by someone with a record of having done so before, as that means it may have been preventable with better screening.",1417936473

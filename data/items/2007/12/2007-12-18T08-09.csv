WTF!... I'm sorry but that's a <i>ridiculous</i> topic to have in a college networking course. Is ""Web 1.0"" a prerequisite?",1197968335

90673,comment,90601,90646,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"It's definitely a good thing to understand how the lower levels of an abstracted system works. For example, read Joel Spolsky's explanation of ""Shlemiel the painter's algorithm"" problem: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000319.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000319.html</a><p>Perhaps a more applicable example in web applications is the use of things like Ruby on Rails ActiveRecord. If you had no idea how ActiveRecord worked, you might end up making zillions of database queries without even realizing it. I have a feeling this is part of the reason some people have trouble scaling Rails apps...<p>In the case of networking and web apps, at the very least it's a good idea to know things like the difference between TCP and UDP. You probably don't need to know routing protocols and that sort of thing though.<p>That said, I'm not sure which to recommend. I took some of both (2 networking courses, and basic logic was covered in discrete math and 2 AI courses I took... including the one I have a final for in 7 hours...) and I've found the networking ones to be <i>much</i> more applicable, but it's also good to know about logic as well.",1197967414

No, really, don't!<p>Just be ready to profile and refactor your code when you <i>do</i> need to scale.<p>That said, you can improve the odds with practices that are almost cost-free, but will help a lot later on.<p>- Read Cal Henderson's book.<p>- The center of your design should be the data store, not a process. You transition the data store from state to state, securely and reliably, in small increments.<p>- Avoid globals and session state. The more ""pure"" your function is, the easier it will be to cache or partition.<p>- Don't make your data store too smart. Calculations and renderings should happen in a separate, asynchronous process.<p>- The data store should be able to handle lots of concurrent connections. Minimize locking. (Read about optimistic locking).<p>- Protect your algorithm from the implementation of the data store, with a helper class or module or whatever. But don't (DO NOT) try to build a framework for any conceivable query. Just the ones your algorithm needs.<p>Think this is obvious? Just the other day I heard of a project, staffed by so-called experts, that made every one of the mistakes I mentioned above. And in simulations, they cannot even keep up with the load they expect at launch.",1197966886

Does anybody else do this? I've always used Eclipse, but I figure something must be good about Netbeans to cause him to use 2 IDEs.",1197965917

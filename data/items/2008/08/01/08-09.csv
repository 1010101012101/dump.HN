Basically he didn't want to know anything about the interviewee except what job he was considered for, to the extent that if anyone told him any details (like ""Harvard graduate"") he'd refuse to interview him, as his perspective would already be tainted.",1217580731

""Floor Care"" gives 97 results, but the category on the left claims 71<p>These little details can lead to frustration for the user.<p>Visual Design / Branding<p>* Particularly considering your target market here, you guys desperately need a visual designer to create an attractive look for your site, and to give your site a feeling.  Look for example at <a href=""http://www.projectwedding.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.projectwedding.com/</a>.  They do a great job of design, where every element of the page is intended to evoke an emotion or association in the mind of the viewer, from their logo to the color scheme, to the (I assume) hand-picked lead imagery for the front page.  Of course yours will be different, because your target market is different, but you can get a general idea from them.<p>* For example, you should not just have text examples, but show the thing that your buyer wants, so they can more easily make the association, and even make the leap to thinking what their home would look like if only they had those drapes &c.<p>* You also need a name and logo which can mean something to the user.  Even non-sense brand names are chosen specifically to evoke an idea or emotion, to make some association.  You should pick a name which really communicates what your site is, though not necessarily in direct terms.<p>I agree with others though, that the site looks promising.  Good luck!",1217580261

This ""missing link"" in electolysis has been the production of O2. Now this is possible. And now a closed loop of water splitting and water production is possible for the first time apparently. So, this could indeed be a possible way to store energy for times when there is no sun or wind available to produce electricity. Nocera also mentions that there are already alternatives for Pt for the hydrogen production and they are going to test them.<p>However, indeed nothing is said on the efficiency of the whole process and thus the economics of this process. How large a system do you need for a household and what would it cost? Hopefully we will get answers soon.<p>Still you need photovoltaic cells or windmills to produce electricity for your house, your car, etc. And you need extra electricity to produce H2 and O2 for times when there is no sun or wind. PV cells still cost a lot and still are not efficient enough (thus take up too much space). So, there are still other missing links to solve to really start a electricity revolution.",1217579970

But hey, I already bought my phone, I should just be able to get a non-contract plan, especially if I'm willing to pay the full (phone-subsidizing) price each month, right?<p>Nope. You can't get a normal monthly plan without signing up to at least a one-year contract. I even had to pay for the freaking sim card, not to speak of the activation fee. So I paid something like $500-550 for my phone, sim card, and activation fee, and I'm <i>still</i> in a one-year contract, all for the same monthly rate that I would be paying if I had gotten a plan that came with a free phone.<p>Something is wrong here.",1217578166

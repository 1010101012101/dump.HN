I also think they erred in repeatedly describing what Swartz did as ""hacking."" They even dropped the obligatory  ""alleged"" after the first mention.<p>Someone reading this article would come away thinking that Swartz ""hacked into"" the MIT network and ""stole"" millions of documents.

5064032,comment,5058703,5059576,2,0,teyc,,,"When Russian authorities jailed Pussyriot for dancing on a church altar under the charges of ""hooliganism and inciting religious hatred"", it is clear that the authoritarian streak had gone too far.<p>Many people have thought Swartz's crime was to download documents. But actually, JSTOR has stated they had settled with Swartz and it was not a problem and not to press charges.<p>What the government actually did is to charge Swartz for WIRE FRAUD. This is for plugging his computer into the MIT LAN. WIRE FRAUD is reserved for people with <i>criminal</i> intent. Aaron's actions were as criminal as Pussyriot's dancing in miniskirts to draw attention to Putin's hand on the Russian government.<p>The US government will continue to spin this as ""hacker"" and ""document download"". Do not get drawn into this. The correct framework to think about this is when Gandhi and his supporters got clobbered by the British police for breaking a salt-making monopoly. To Gandhi, the premise was simple: salt comes from the sea and no one owns it. A law that grants monopolistic rights to limited organisations for something as universal as the sea has no justification.<p>It is important to note that Aaron was not talking about giving away MP3s etc. He pointed out that scientific papers that were already in the public domain were starting to get locked up behind pay walls. There is nothing right about this. When he started to figuratively walk to the ocean to make his own salt, he was charged with criminal trespass.<p>As a footnote, after the Salt March - where hundreds of non-violent protesters were beaten up by the police - the British was shown up to be bankrupt of moral authority. This, is the threat the DOJ faces today.",1358294358

5064015,comment,5056304,5062782,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"I'm glad you agree that the CFAA is problematic. I think we may to some extent be talking past each other.<p>What I am objecting to is legislation in the style of the CFAA. Notwithstanding the name, it is barely addressed to <i>fraud</i> at all. It concerns itself primarily with unauthorized access, arguably a component of certain types of fraud, but which is a completely ridiculous thing to legislate against. Because while it is probably safe to assume that unauthorized access is generally bad, the question of <i>how bad</i> is determined entirely by the specific facts of the case. If you access a computer (e.g. your family member's work laptop) ""without authorization"" in order to check your own email, that is on an entirely different planet from doing so in order to obtain military secrets in preparation for a terrorist attack. The entire world of possible criminal penalties lives between those extremes. So prohibiting what is quite plausibly the precursor to an entire legal code worth of different crimes is totally absurd because there is no sane way to assign proportional penalties to it -- if you assign penalties greater than those of the most trivial of offenses then you create a disproportional penalty for such offenses just because a computer was involved and even trivial offenses are, as a rule, unauthorized. In theory one might argue that unauthorized access should still be an offense with the lowest of maximum penalties, e.g. a $100 fine, but with penalties that low it just seems like a waste of effort to even bother with it. And it sounds like you may agree with some of that, though I'm not sure what possible value you think can be salvaged from it.<p>What you're talking about with electronic forms perhaps not matching up with 20th century fraud legislation is a completely different animal. I think as a general rule that is the sort of thing that judges are able to see through, but in specific cases where this has failed to occur it naturally makes sense for the legislature to update the statute.<p>I'm just still not clear why you believe it should be a <i>separate statute</i> rather than merely a collection of relatively minor updates to long-standing law. I don't see how setting up a fake physical storefront and then collecting layaway deposits before skipping town to the next state should require a distinct piece of legislation from doing the exact same thing with a website. Perhaps the language will have to be adjusted to make sure the new offenders fall into scope, but why should the penalties be different? Or (in broad strokes) the elements of the crime? Or the intent requirement? Why reinvent the wheel? If you reinvent the wheel you get untested catastrophes like ""unauthorized access to a computer.""",1358294178

Remember, at first the investigators had no idea who was accessing the network. They had to place a camera to find out. Moreover, as a general rule, prosecutors don't go to lengths to really explore the character of defendants, because people are punished or not for their actions, not their character.<p>> sharing his politics is not necessary for a just outcome<p>No, but it totally shapes your perception of justice. Entertain the notion of someone who believes that copyrighted articles are really property, and that network boundaries are like real life fences. To such a person, what Swartz did seems like hopping a fence at a public art gallery to steal the paintings. But, most people on HN seem to subscribe to the politics that say a network boundary is like a ""keep off the grass"" sign at a public park, and that research articles aren't anyone's property at all. They are outraged that anyone would get in serious trouble for merely trampling on the grass and taking the fallen leaves on the ground.<p>> given this occurred at MIT, an institution whose primary notable achievement is the celebration of hacker culture<p>I think very few people would consider MIT's primary notable achievement to be the celebration of hacker culture. That's not what ordinary people think about MIT. They think it's like the show Fringe. Even within technologically-minded people, I think celebration of MIT's hacker culture is limited mostly to the CS set.

Personally, I think that Angular is a local maximum in client-side JavaScript app development. But even if you don't agree, you should at least understand how it is different.<p>1) Angular prefers declarative<p>This doesn't mean you don't write procedural code. This means that if you want to do something proceedural, you should package it up as a Directive. Directives are where behavior and logic live. Your templates simply arrange and parameterize a tree of directives. This means that you have limited and well understood moving parts that can be tested in isolation, in combination, or in the application context. Contrast with the traditional big bag of event callbacks, which can only be tested in the application context and are more difficult to re-use in other application contexts.<p>2) Angular works like a game engine<p>Most traditional UI frameworks are a graph of intertwined callbacks. Games, however, traditionally have a pair of functions called Update and Render. The Update functions permutes the world and the Render function draws the new world. Angular works similarly, but it might not be immediately obvious. There is a ""Dirty Checking"" pass, where your view models, a simple hierarchy of poorly-named ""scopes"" are essentially diff-ed against the previous iteration. Then the Directives take over and permute the DOM to match the new view model.<p>Let's call the ""Controller"" part of the ""ViewModel"" and then just simplify that down to ""Model"". Inherently, Model and View systems are co-dependent. You have a graph like M <--> V. Angular's system graph is less like single bi-directional edge, and more like two directed edges in a cycle. That makes little difference when viewed abstractly with the two subsystems as nodes.

3. Stretch. This doesnt have to be any hardcore yoga regimen. My back tends to be tense by the time I'm done working so its a good time to listen to your body and work on areas so your body is relaxed. Do this until you do feel relaxed. Sometimes its 10 minutes, other times its 30 minutes. Whichever way, it beats tossing and turning in bed for hours on end.
4. Follow up with a meditation session. Again, no need to follow any regimen here. Just sit, in the dark, collect your thoughts and at a certain point, your mind will be cleared. Its amazing what sitting in a dark, quiet environment for 5~10 minutes will do.<p>There are a ton of resources about relaxation techniques, find one that works for you.

They're not going to prevent you from running bittorrent. But that doesn't mean it's unregulated. It has terms of use: <a href=""http://ist.mit.edu/network/rules"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ist.mit.edu/network/rules</a>. Of the six central tenants, one is: ""Don't misuse the intellectual property of others."" It gets higher billing than: ""Don't use MITnet to harass anyone in any way."" That's the hard boundary. Better not use bittorrent to download copyrighted materials!<p>I think that explains MIT's reaction in this situation. Going into the closet to plug into the network came too close to breaching that hard outer boundary for the University's taste.<p>And to circle back to my other point: MIT's status as massive defense contractor colors how other people perceive what happens there. When the prosecutors in the DOJ think of MIT, they don't think of a place where students are encouraged to ""challenge boundaries."" They think of it as a place that does critical research often on very sensitive subjects--a vital part of the national infrastructure. Please tell me you understand why someone would be more sensitive to a network intrusion at MIT while operating under the latter premise than under the former.",1358290967

AngularJS does a lot more than Backbone and Angular forces you to do things its way, meaning to avoid doing DOM manipulation outside of the framework, which isn't necessarily bad but requires more of a commitment and learning.<p>AngularJS is great for simple apps but once I got beyond that I ended up fighting how to makes things work with the ng-* attributes often having to resort to $apply. Things that are simple with underscore templates and jQuery (the Backbone way) can become very frustrating in AngularJS.<p>AngularJS reminds me of ASP.NET controls with repeaters and coding through attributes.

Seriously, though, garage sales exist because most stuff is so cheap and disposable to begin with that if you tried to sell it for what someone would actually pay for it, you'd be lucky to break even after any shipping, transaction fees and the value of any personal time/effort you put into the process. So, you have a garage sale: you sell it (or at least show it) in all bulk, all at once to minimize effort, with zero transaction or shipping fees. Of course, making the effort to visit a garage sale has a non-negligible cost for the (potential) <i>buyer</i>.<p>There are already thriving markets for stuff that's not cheap and disposable - electronics/phones, recreational/sports equipment, furniture, cars, etc.<p>As for the compunction against discarding something that still works, my solution is to donate it to Goodwill (whatever you do, don't throw it away if it's ""perfectly good"") and take it as a lesson learned - think harder before buying this item, or an item like it, again.",1358290894
